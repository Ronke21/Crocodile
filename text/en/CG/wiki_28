<text>The Minuteman Bikeway, also known as the Minuteman Commuter Bikeway, is a 10-mile (16-kilometre) paved multi-use rail trail located in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. It runs from Bedford to Alewife station, at the northern end of the Red Line in Cambridge, passing through the towns of Lexington and Arlington along the way. Also along the route are several notable regional sites, including Alewife Brook Reservation, the Cyrus Dallin Art Museum, Spy Pond, &quot;Arlington’s Great Meadows&quot; (actually located in Lexington), the Battle Green in Lexington, and Hanscom Air Force Base.

At its Cambridge terminus, the bikeway connects with four other bike paths: 
*the Fitchburg Cutoff Path going west
*the Alewife Linear Park which, in turn, leads east to the Somerville Community Path. 
*the Alewife Brook Greenway going northwest, a connection to the Mystic River bike path following Alewife Brook. The Alewife Brook extension received $4M from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as the &quot;Minuteman Bikepath Connector&quot; project.
* a sidewalk path going south to Fresh Pond Reservation and the Watertown Cambridge Greenway

The Somerville Community Path was extended to downtown Boston in the summer of 2023, creating a much larger continuous bikeway accessible from the Minuteman.

At the Bedford end, the Minuteman Bikeway connects with the Narrow Gauge Rail Trail and the Reformatory Branch Rail Trail.

== History ==

The path comprising the current Minuteman Bikeway has a long history. The trail closely approximates the route that Paul Revere took on his famous ride in 1775, which heralded the beginning of the American Revolution.

Along the way to becoming a railroad, the path&#x27;s right-of-way (ROW) was laid out east of Lexington in 1846 by the Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad and west of Lexington in 1873 by the Middlesex Central Railroad. Part of the original track can be seen in Arlington, near Uncle Sam Plaza in front of the Cyrus Dallin Art Museum.

Railbanking of the line was first proposed in 1974, three years before passenger rail service was discontinued, and a full seven years before rail service was discontinued altogether (in 1981). In 1991, the final plan for the conversion was approved, and construction started on the original section of the bikeway. The Arlington–Lexington section of the path was dedicated in September 1992; the Lexington–Bedford segment was delayed by water main construction and opened in May 1993. In 1998, the bikeway was extended a short distance from East Arlington to Alewife station in Cambridge. 

In 2002, it was repaved in Arlington and in 2004, the Bedford Depot Park Enhancement Project was completed at its western terminus. In 2008, the bikeway was the fifth inductee into the national Rail-Trail Hall of Fame by the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.

The property is currently owned by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and leased to the municipalities through which it passes on an interim basis as the ROW is railbanked. The MBTA at one point planned to use this ROW to extend the Red Line to Arlington Center and Arlington Heights.

The crossing of the path through Arlington Center was rebuilt in 2017 to be less discontinuous.

==Uses==
Area residents use the bikeway for a host of activities, including bicycling, walking, jogging, and inline skating. The main use of the path, however, is for casual biking. In the winter there is often enough snow on the bikeway for cross-country skiing. However, it is now plowed from Alewife Station to Bedford. No motorized vehicles are allowed except for powered wheelchairs and emergency vehicles.

==Future possibilities==

New connections under contemplation include one from Lexington to the Battle Road Trail and one to the Charles River bike path via Fresh Pond Reservation and the abandoned Watertown Branch Railroad. The Watertown Cambridge Greenway was completed in 2022.

In April 2014, state officials announced that the Somerville Community Path would be extended alongside the Green Line Extension, creating a continuous 4.5 mile route from the Minuteman Bikeway to Boston’s Charles River Bike Path. Officials had contemplated abandoning the path portion of the GLX in order to save costs, but after hiring new management, a contractor agreed to the parallel path while still cutting costs. The extension was completed in the summer of 2023.

<doc id="982384" wikidata="Q946539" url="?curid=982384" title="Sam Farha">
<text>Ihsan &quot;Sam&quot; Farha (; born 23 February 1959 in Beirut, Lebanon) is a Lebanese professional poker player. He is best known for finishing as runner up in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event in 2003. He has won three bracelets at the WSOP in his career.

== Private life ==
When the civil war erupted in Lebanon in 1975, the Farha family moved to the United States in search of a better life.

The young Ihsan &quot;Sammy&quot; Farha went on to earn a degree in business administration from the University of Kansas. While completing his studies, he also learned to play pool, ping ball, and the video game Pac Man so well that he earned substantial money by playing these games against others for cash.

After graduating from college, he moved to Houston, Texas. That is where he had his first encounter with poker, in the eighties. Shortly after, he made a trip to Las Vegas. His winnings at the poker tables made him realize he could make a living playing cards. Farha then decided to quit his job and moved to Vegas.

==World Series of Poker==
Farha&#x27;s biggest tournament finish was in the 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event, where he finished second to Chris Moneymaker for $1,300,000. On TV, Farha was identified as an &quot;investor&quot;, a job Farha said he never actually held but was rather an identity he held to convince people to start a game with him. On the second day of play, Farha lost a major pot to Barry Greenstein leaving him with only 10% of the average stack. He was considering leaving at this point and was talked into staying in the tournament by Greenstein. He lost the final hand to Moneymaker when he went all-in with a pair of jacks on the flop, only to be called by Moneymaker who had flopped bottom two pair, which held after the final river card was dealt.

In a rematch between Farha and Moneymaker a few months later, organized by PokerStars, Farha won. They played against each other again in a special &quot;grudge match&quot; during 2011 World Series of Poker, which was won by Moneymaker in best-of-three format.

===World Series of Poker bracelets===

All of Farha&#x27;s WSOP bracelets have come in Omaha events.

==Other poker activities==
*Farha has also finished in the money in the National Heads-Up Poker Championship, once for $75,000 and the other time for $125,000. He also has three cashes in World Poker Tour events, for a little over $100,000.
*Farha co-authored a book &quot;Farha on Omaha&quot;, a detailed guide on Omaha poker strategy. Farha intersperses basic strategies with his own personal strategies, so players can learn not only the game but also the style of Farha himself.
*Farha is working on a book, tentatively titled &quot;Luck is Far More Than Enough&quot;, a reality TV poker series, and a video game.
*Farha is a spokesman for Harrah&#x27;s casino in Las Vegas.
*Farha has appeared on the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;, in seasons 1-4. Farha also made a cameo appearance in the 2007 film &quot;Lucky You&quot;.
*As of 2017, his total winnings exceed $2,800,000 in live tournament poker, although he tends to primarily play in high-stakes Omaha cash games. His eleven cashes at the WSOP account for $2,586,105 of those winnings.

<doc id="982385" wikidata="Q2270191" url="?curid=982385" title="Total Film">
<text>Total Film was a British film magazine published 13 times a year (published monthly with a summer issue added, between the July and August issues, every year since issue 91, 2004) by Future Publishing. The magazine was launched in 1997 and offered cinema, DVD and Blu-ray news, reviews, and features. &quot;Total Film&quot; was available both in print and interactive iPad editions.

In 2014, it was announced online that &quot;Total Film&quot; would be merging into &quot;GamesRadar+,&quot; alongside &quot;SFX&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;.

In October 2024, Future announced that the publication of &quot;Total Film&quot; would be ending on issue 356, with the publication joining &quot;All About Space&quot;, &quot;Total 911&quot; and &quot;3D World&quot; as titles axed by the company at the same time.

==Features==
Each month, &quot;Total Film&quot; provided a range of features, from spotlight interviews with actors and directors to the making of on-set pieces for new and future releases. Each issue always included the &quot;&quot;Total Film&quot; Interview&quot;, which was a six-page in-depth chat with an actor or director, along with a critique of their body of work.

==Key sections within the magazine==
; Dialogue: The section where readers could interact with the magazine, this contained readers&#x27; letters, emails, and feedback from the magazine&#x27;s social media followers (&quot;TF&quot;&#x27;s Forum, Facebook, and Twitter). Each month, &quot;TF&quot; offered a DVD for each published missive. A regular feature within &quot;Dialogue&quot; included &quot;Office Spaced&quot; where snippets of conversation from the &quot;TF&quot; office are shared.

; Buzz: The &quot;Total Film&quot; news section, provided details on upcoming films, including first-look photos, on-set visits, and exclusive &quot;sneak peeks&quot;. Regular features included: &quot;Ever Met Tom Cruise?&quot; where a behind-the-scenes person is interviewed, e.g. a stuntwoman or a casting director; &quot;You Talkin&#x27; To Me?&quot; where stars would answer questions posed as famous film quotes and &quot;Red Light, Green Light&quot; for what is trending upwards in terms of interest and what is not in the film industry. Also included was the &quot;60-Second Screenplay&quot;, which is a cut-down, humorous version of a movie script.

; Agenda: Billed as being &quot;for the sharper movie fan&quot;, this section often previewed more eclectic and less mainstream releases and players. Richard Ayoade from &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; wrote a column for &quot;Agenda&quot;.

; Screen: The main cinema reviews section, with every new movie for that month reviewed and rated. Major releases received comprehensive coverage, with a star rating out of five, the magazine&#x27;s own &quot;Predicted Interest Curve&quot; - a graph that demonstrated which moments of a film are likely to hold the viewer&#x27;s attention and a short &quot;Verdict&quot;. Also briefly listed were similar recommendations under &quot;See this if you liked...&quot; Smaller films received a concise review and rating. The end of the section was devoted to the current US and UK box office charts, an irreverent flashback to an old issue and summaries of any films that were not shown to journalists in time for that month&#x27;s print deadline.

; Lounge: &quot;TF&quot;″s home entertainment guide, including reviews of the latest DVDs and Blu-rays, as well as some games, soundtracks and books. Regular features included &quot;Is It Just Me?&quot;, where a &quot;TF&quot; writer got to rant about a particular (often controversial) film-related point of view, with readers then given the right to reply via the TF Forum or website; &quot;Instant Expert&quot; which gave a rundown of the key facts you need to know about an actor, director or movie genre; and &quot;&quot;TF&quot; Loves&quot;, which picked out a certain scene or character rated by the magazine.

==Foreign editions==

<doc id="982386" wikidata="Q634557" url="?curid=982386" title="Killing form">
<text>In mathematics, the Killing form, named after Wilhelm Killing, is a symmetric bilinear form that plays a basic role in the theories of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Cartan&#x27;s criteria (criterion of solvability and criterion of semisimplicity) show that Killing form has a close relationship to the semisimplicity of the Lie algebras.

==History and name==
The Killing form was essentially introduced into Lie algebra theory by in his thesis. In a historical survey of Lie theory, has described how the term &quot;Killing form&quot; first occurred in 1951 during one of his own reports for the Séminaire Bourbaki; it arose as a misnomer, since the form had previously been used by Lie theorists, without a name attached. Some other authors now employ the term &quot;Cartan-Killing form&quot;. At the end of the 19th century, Killing had noted that the coefficients of the characteristic equation of a regular semisimple element of a Lie algebra are invariant under the adjoint group, from which it follows that the Killing form (i.e. the degree 2 coefficient) is invariant, but he did not make much use of the fact. A basic result that Cartan made use of was Cartan&#x27;s criterion, which states that the Killing form is non-degenerate if and only if the Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras.

== Definition ==

Consider a Lie algebra formula_1 over a field . Every element of formula_2 defines the adjoint endomorphism (also written as ) of formula_1 with the help of the Lie bracket, as

:formula_4

Now, supposing formula_1 is of finite dimension, the trace of the composition of two such endomorphisms defines a symmetric bilinear form

:formula_6

with values in , the Killing form on formula_1.

== Properties ==
The following properties follow as theorems from the above definition.

* The Killing form is bilinear and symmetric. 
* The Killing form is an invariant form, as are all other forms obtained from Casimir operators. The derivation of Casimir operators vanishes; for the Killing form, this vanishing can be written as
::formula_8 
: where [ , ] is the Lie bracket.

* If formula_1 is a simple Lie algebra then any invariant symmetric bilinear form on formula_1 is a scalar multiple of the Killing form.
* The Killing form is also invariant under automorphisms of the algebra formula_1, that is,

::formula_12
:for in formula_13.

* The Cartan criterion states that a Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is non-degenerate.
* The Killing form of a nilpotent Lie algebra is identically zero.
* If are two ideals in a Lie algebra formula_1 with zero intersection, then and are orthogonal subspaces with respect to the Killing form.
* The orthogonal complement with respect to of an ideal is again an ideal.
* If a given Lie algebra formula_1 is a direct sum of its ideals , then the Killing form of formula_1 is the direct sum of the Killing forms of the individual summands.

== Matrix elements ==

Given a basis of the Lie algebra formula_1, the matrix elements of the Killing form are given by

:formula_18

Here

:formula_19

in Einstein summation notation, where the are the structure coefficients of the Lie algebra. The index functions as column index and the index as row index in the matrix . Taking the trace amounts to putting and summing, and so we can write

:formula_20

The Killing form is the simplest 2-tensor that can be formed from the structure constants. The form itself is then formula_21

In the above indexed definition, we are careful to distinguish upper and lower indices (&quot;co-&quot; and &quot;contra-variant&quot; indices). This is because, in many cases, the Killing form can be used as a metric tensor on a manifold, in which case the distinction becomes an important one for the transformation properties of tensors. When the Lie algebra is semisimple over a zero-characteristic field, its Killing form is nondegenerate, and hence can be used as a metric tensor to raise and lower indexes. In this case, it is always possible to choose a basis for formula_1 such that the structure constants with all upper indices are completely antisymmetric.

The Killing form for some Lie algebras formula_1 are (for in formula_1 viewed in their fundamental matrix representation):
The table shows that the Dynkin index for the adjoint representation is equal to twice the dual Coxeter number.

== Connection with real forms ==
Suppose that formula_1 is a semisimple Lie algebra over the field of real numbers formula_26. By Cartan&#x27;s criterion, the Killing form is nondegenerate, and can be diagonalized in a suitable basis with the diagonal entries . By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, the number of positive entries is an invariant of the bilinear form, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the diagonalizing basis, and is called the index of the Lie algebra formula_1. This is a number between and the dimension of formula_1 which is an important invariant of the real Lie algebra. In particular, a real Lie algebra formula_1 is called compact if the Killing form is negative definite (or negative semidefinite if the Lie algebra is not semisimple). Note that this is one of two inequivalent definitions commonly used for compactness of a Lie algebra; the other states that a Lie algebra is compact if it corresponds to a compact Lie group. The definition of compactness in terms of negative definiteness of the Killing form is more restrictive, since using this definition it can be shown that under the Lie correspondence, compact Lie algebras correspond to compact semisimple Lie groups.

If formula_30 is a semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, then there are several non-isomorphic real Lie algebras whose complexification is formula_30, which are called its real forms. It turns out that every complex semisimple Lie algebra admits a unique (up to isomorphism) compact real form formula_1. The real forms of a given complex semisimple Lie algebra are frequently labeled by the positive index of inertia of their Killing form.

For example, the complex special linear algebra formula_33 has two real forms, the real special linear algebra, denoted formula_34, and the special unitary algebra, denoted formula_35. The first one is noncompact, the so-called split real form, and its Killing form has signature . The second one is the compact real form and its Killing form is negative definite, i.e. has signature . The corresponding Lie groups are the noncompact group formula_36 of real matrices with the unit determinant and the special unitary group formula_37, which is compact.

== Trace forms ==
Let formula_38 be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over the field formula_39, and formula_40 be a Lie algebra representation. Let formula_41 be the trace functional on formula_42. Then we can define the trace form for the representation formula_43 as
:formula_44
:formula_45
Then the Killing form is the special case that the representation is the adjoint representation, formula_46. 

It is easy to show that this is symmetric, bilinear and invariant for any representation formula_43.

If furthermore formula_38 is simple and formula_43 is irreducible, then it can be shown formula_50 where formula_51 is the index of the representation.

<text>The western leaf-toed gecko (Phyllodactylus lepidopygus) is a species of gecko. It is endemic to Peru. It was described by Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1845.

The species&#x27; natural habitat is restricted to the central coast of Peru, between the regions of Ica and Ancash. In the Lima region, a large portion of its coastal habitat has been negatively affected by urban development. Within the city of Lima, sightings were reported in 2004 in the Pantanos de Villa Reserved Zone, where the species may have found a good opportunity to survive. Large populations of this species are found in the &quot;lomas&quot; (fog-supported vegetation communities) of Pachacamac and Lachay.

<text>Stocks Mill is a Grade II* listed post mill in Wittersham on the Isle of Oxney, in Kent, England which has been preserved.

==History==

Probably built around 1781, it was named &quot;Stocks Mill&quot; after the village stocks that stood nearby. The mill may be older and may have been moved from Stone in Oxney, with the date 1781 carved into the main post denoting its re-erection. The Mill House was at one time used as the parish Poorhouse. The mill was last worked circa 1900, and was then preserved by Norman Forbes-Robertson, who owned the mill and Mill House. The mill passed into the ownership of the artist Randolph H Sauter. and then Sir Edward Parry. The mill was repaired in 1958, and in 1968 a new stock and pair of sails was fitted by the millwright Derek Ogden. In 1980, the mill was acquired by Kent County Council and the Friends of Stocks Mill was set up to allow the mill to be opened to the public. The mill underwent a restoration programme starting in 2002 and partly funded by the National Lottery, which included two new sails amongst other work. Some of the milling machinery which had been removed over the years was recreated. The mill was reopened to the public in 2004.

==Description==
Stocks Mill is a post mill on a single storey roundhouse. It has four Spring sails mounted on a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. This carries a diameter wooden Head Wheel with 120 cogs, and a diameter Tail Wheel. The mill drove two pairs of millstones.

<text>Donald Smith Airey (born 21 June 1948) is an English musician who has been the keyboardist in the rock band Deep Purple since 2002, after the retirement of Jon Lord. He has had a long and productive career, playing with such acts as Gary Moore, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull, Whitesnake, Saxon, Wishbone Ash, Colosseum II, Ten, Sinner, Michael Schenker, Rainbow, Empire, Brian May, Divlje jagode and Living Loud. He has also worked with Andrew Lloyd Webber.

==Early life==
Inspired by his father, Norman Airey, Don Airey took a love for music at a young age and was trained in classical piano from the age of seven. He continued his love for music by earning a degree at the University of Nottingham and a diploma at the Royal Northern College of Music (where he studied under Ryszard Bakst). Following his studies, he formed a band and worked on P&amp;O cruise liners travelling the world.

==Career==

===1970s work===
In 1971 he moved to London and joined Cozy Powell&#x27;s band Hammer. In 1975 he joined Jon Hiseman&#x27;s highly influential jazz rock band Colosseum II, along with Gary Moore, Neil Murray, Mike Starrs and later John Mole. They made three albums and also formed the core band for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s album &quot;Variations&quot;, a set of variations on a theme by Paganini. Don worked on several albums with solo artists and was a session musician on the 1978 Black Sabbath album &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; Soon after, he joined guitarist Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s band, Rainbow, and featured on Gary Moore&#x27;s solo debut &quot;Back on the Streets&quot;. With Rainbow he contributed to two hit albums, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; and &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;.

===1980s work===
After leaving Rainbow in 1981, Airey joined with Ozzy Osbourne for a three-year stint where he helped with the albums &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; and &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;. He also played on the Diary of a Madman Tour from 1981 to 1982 and appears on &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and was also the only witness to Randy Rhoads&#x27;s death. Airey joined Jethro Tull in 1987 for their tour in support of &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;. The same year also saw the release of Whitesnake&#x27;s multi-platinum &quot;Whitesnake&quot;, on which Airey played keyboards. Soon after he quit the band to record the solo album &quot;K2 – Tales of Triumph and Tragedy&quot;. In it he plays with Gary Moore and Keith Airey – guitars, Cozy Powell – drums, Laurence Cottle – bass, Chris (Hamlet) Thompson, Colin Blunstone, Mel Galley, and Genki Hitomi – vocals.

===1990s onwards===
In 1990, Airey recorded keyboard parts for several songs on Judas Priest&#x27;s album &quot;Painkiller&quot;. However, because Judas Priest wanted the album to have a heavier sound than their previous work, only one song on &quot;Painkiller&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot;, prominently features Airey. In a 2020 interview, Airey revealed that he also played most of the album&#x27;s bass parts on a Minimoog, as Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill was unable to participate in recording sessions due to illness. He also toured with the Japanese heavy metal band Anthem, in 1990 and 1992. 

In 1997 he arranged and played on &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; by Katrina and the Waves, conducting the accompanying orchestra at the Eurovision Song Contest. The song won the contest.

In 1999 he joined Manchester-based melodic hard rock band Ten where he played keyboards on the album &quot;Babylon&quot;, which was released in 2000. He also toured with the band in support of the new album.

Airey played keyboards on the song &quot;Darkness Be My Friend&quot; by Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, released on the 2002 reissue of Dickinson&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;. Airey also played keyboards on At Vance&#x27;s Olaf Lenk&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Sunset Cruise&quot;. In 2006 Airey featured on Gary Moore&#x27;s release &quot;Old New Ballads Blues&quot; contributing to all tracks.

In 2008 Airey released his second solo album, &quot;A Light in the Sky&quot; and recently it has been announced that another solo album from Airey is set to premiere in 2011.

In early 2014 Airey joined hard rock band Hollywood Monsters where he played keyboards (Hammond B3 organ) on the track &quot;Move On&quot; on the album &quot;Big Trouble&quot; which was released in 2014 on Mausoleum Records. The album features Steph Honde on vocals and guitars, Vinny Appice on drums, Tim Bogert on bass and Paul Di&#x27;Anno on lead vocals on the bonus track.

On 18 January 2017, Airey was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History.

In January 2020, Airey played two shows with Uriah Heep, filling in for Phil Lanzon after the keyboardist&#x27;s son died.

Airey joined Deep Purple in 2001 to fill in for an injured Jon Lord, who subsequently retired from the band. Airey joined the band as a full-time keyboardist in March 2002. He has recorded seven studio albums with the band, &quot;Bananas,&quot; &quot;Rapture of the Deep,&quot; &quot;Now What?!&quot;, &quot;Infinite&quot;, &quot;Whoosh!&quot;, &quot;Turning to Crime&quot;, and &quot;=1.&quot;

Interviewed by Jeb Wright, for Classic Rock Revisited, about the album &quot;Now What?!&quot;, he said &quot;Well, it&#x27;s Deep Purple and there is a Hammond there. There is only one way to go, really. Over the years, I have really worked on my sound, it didn&#x27;t just happen overnight. The first two, or three, years I was with the band, I was using Jon&#x27;s C3 and it was pretty knackered. I had it refurbished. It&#x27;s been put in mothballs now... I much prefer Hammond A-100&#x27;s, that&#x27;s my choice.&quot;

==Instruments and gear==
Airey has employed many instruments and effect processors to aid him in the creation of his music and is well known for the use of his Hammond A100. In an interview with Keyboard Magazine Don Airey explained that he preferred the Hammond A-100 over other organs (including the Hammond B-3) for their &quot;purer tone&quot; in live settings. He also uses Leslie 122 speakers and a Hughes and Kettner Puretone amplifier. For piano sounds, Airey uses a Kurzweil PC3K8 and also uses a Moog Voyager. He also uses several rack and pedal based units such as a Roland Fantom.

Airey is also an endorsing artist for several effects companies including Neunaber Audio and TC Electronic and currently uses a Neunaber Seraphim Shimmer as well as a TC Hall of Fame Reverb and a TC Flashback Delay.

==Personal life==
Airey lives with his wife, Doris, and their three children in South West Cambridgeshire. In 1992, Airey&#x27;s son suffered from a serious illness, causing him to slow down his musical activity until 1995. Airey is an ardent Sunderland A.F.C. fan.

He has a brother, Keith Airey, who played guitar for Nik Kershaw during the mid-1980s and the reformed version of The Zombies from 2001 to 2010 and is currently lead guitarist for the London stage show &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;.

His other brother, Paul Airey, played piano for SlowBone and Rollups and currently works with Robbie Gladwell and his band.

He is currently writing a book about his experiences in the music business.

<text>Switch Island is a major road junction near Aintree in Merseyside, England, in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. The junction is at the western terminus of both the M57 and M58 motorways, which converge on the A59 trunk road, the north-south route from Liverpool. The junction is also the terminus of the A5036, a road which serves the Port of Liverpool, and the A5758 which serves as a bypass for the village of Thornton.

For the period between the 1930s and mid 1970s, the island was a simple roundabout formation until the arrival of the motorways. The junction was significantly expanded in 1980 and was initially planned to be an interim layout, however subsequent additions and amendments throughout the years, separate to the original intentions, has transformed it from the original roundabout design and then-envisaged grade separated junction.

The junction carries up to 100,000 vehicles a day with continued improvements being a priority for National Highways. The through route of the dual carriageway is not the A59 south to the A59 north, but from the A5036 south to the A59 north, effectively resulting in two motorways and the port road feeding onto the A59 through route. Switch Island has been described as one of England’s busiest motorway junctions and is prone to traffic collisions due to its extensive utilisation and inadequate layout.

==History==
===Original formation===

The junction originates from the construction of Dunnings Bridge Road during the 1930s, linking what is now known as the A59 to the A5036 (then known as the A567 road). Starting as a simple t-junction, a roundabout appeared on maps from the late 1930s. The etymology of the name &quot;switch island&quot; is uncertain, although references to the new &quot;switch road&quot; linking Maghull to northern Liverpool appeared in 1938 upon the link road&#x27;s opening. The earliest media references to &quot;switch island&quot; can be dated to the mid-1950s.

The junction remained unchanged until construction of the M57 motorway in 1974, when the original island fell out of use as the layout around it changed to accommodate motorway junction roads. A road map from 1975 shows the original island alongside new roads to the east connecting the motorway.

===Motorway junctions===

During phase 2 of the M57 construction in the mid 1970s, the motorway was routed to terminate at the junction, which involved constructing a new link road for the entry and exit sliproads, with the original roundabout becoming largely redundant. The new road connecting the M57 motorway would later become the eastern section of the future island roundabout.

The previous two-way traffic road changed to a northbound route only, with southbound traffic now using the new motorway link road, connecting up to the A59 road at what was the former roundabout.
Subsequent to the M58 motorway being constructed and also linked to the junction, the western half of the island was constructed thus completing a roundabout island that was entirely separate to what had been originally constructed prior to the motorways. The plans for the two motorways involved them converging at this junction then continuing west, whilst the A59 continued uninterrupted under (or over) the island in a grade separation arrangement, with slip roads to and from the junction. These plans never saw fruition and instead all roads converge at a single flat level intersection junction.

Aside from various improvement works over the years, the configuration of the island from 1980 onwards has changed little, with the exception of considerably more traffic utilising the junction and additional roads being constructed within and to the junction.

The junction underwent a minor redesign in 2006 when new section of carriageway was built at the M57 terminus, allowing motorists to directly transfer onto either the A5036 or A59 roads. The primary objective was to ensure the junction could withstand the predicted increase in road traffic for the next decade and help improve the flow of an estimated 43,000 vehicles daily. At this time, the island was handling up to 80,000 vehicles every day, of which 10% were heavy goods vehicles and resulting in extensive traffic queues leading to increased risks of traffic accidents. The roadworks completed in Spring 2006, resulting in a revised junction layout and removing the roundabout configuration. A short stretch of the original roundabout remained in existence to be utilised as an inspection area and weighbridge, operated by the Vehicle Inspectorate; this was reconstructed following construction of the new Thornton to Switch island link road which has carriageway in some parts of the old roundabout.

In September 2013, Sefton Council approved construction of the long-campaigned Thornton to Switch island link road, which started construction towards the end of the 2013 calendar year and opened on 19 August 2015 as the A5758 Broom&#x27;s Cross Road. The route connects to the junction at its western side and provides a more efficient route from the A565 road. Further improvements were announced in April 2017 for work to take place during 2018, including new traffic light installations, changes to lane markings, new barriers between carriageways and improved signage.

In May 2018 these roadworks were named as the most dangerous in England.

==Operation==
The junction is prone to traffic collisions, which has been exacerbated since the opening of the Thornton bypass in 2015. This has further complicated and changed an already complex and congested junction, which is one of Europe&#x27;s busiest road junctions. Motorists have identified unclear and missing road markings as contributing towards the increase in collisions at the island, resulting in Sefton Council, who are responsible for the junction, making a number of amendments during 2016 as a result of feedback and ongoing reviews. In a 5 year period throughout 2013-2017, there were over 60 collisions at the junction, of which around 10% were classed as severe. As of 2017, an estimated 90,000 vehicles a day pass through the island.

==Routes==
The junction serves the following routes, some of which terminate at the island;
==Future proposals==
Proposals have been put forward by Highways England to build a new link road through Rimrose Valley to ease congestion on the A5036 route for traffic heading towards the motorways via Switch Island. The proposal has been met with local opposition, with suggestions that the road through the valley would be destructive towards public health, wildlife and air quality.

<text>Sacriston is a village, civil parish and electoral ward in County Durham, England, situated north of the city of Durham. The area has been populated since the Bronze Age.

==History==
===Early history===
The Sacriston area has been populated since the Bronze Age, but the first recorded settlement dates back to the 13th century, to Sacristan&#x27;s Heugh. According to old maps this was once known as &quot;Segerston Heugh&quot;, and is now known to local people as &quot;Segga&quot;. This farm and manor house was once the residence of the Sacristan, a monk who held the Office of the Sacristan of the monastery at Durham Cathedral. The Sacristan was responsible for providing everything necessary for the services of the cathedral: bread and wine, the vestments etc. He was also responsible for repairs to Durham Cathedral. The funds for carrying out the official duties were generated from the estate of Sacristan&#x27;s Heugh, which was finally demolished shortly after World War II.

===Mining history===
Sacriston Colliery shaft was sunk in 1838 and by the 1890s, the pit employed 600 men, producing 1,000 tons of coal a day. A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1865. The population in 1870-72 was calculated as 2,106, and many of the local inhabitants were said to be employed in the mines.

====Disaster of 1903====
On Monday 16 November 1903, water flooded into the 3rd West district of the &#x27;Busty&#x27; Seam. The inrush killed two miners, John Whittaker (25) and Thomas McCormick (52). McCormick family tradition (source Harry McCormick) is that Thomas McCormick&#x27;s son Gregory had to be restrained from rushing into the flood. When the workings were pumped out another man, Robert Richardson was found on Friday standing on his coal tub having been stranded in the dark, surrounded by dirty flood water for 92 hours. 
&quot;The inquest was opened by Mr. Coroner Graham on the 20th November and adjourned till the 9th December when evidence was taken, and the jury returned a verdict that the two men were accidentally drowned, and that, owing to the peculiar circumstances, no blame attached to the management.&quot; The Royal Humane Society awarded a silver medal to six mine officials. The enquiry lasted just five hours. See the Durham County Advertiser news report.

Miners themselves have not all been convinced that the management was innocent or that the medals were appropriate. There have been suggestions that cover-ups were commonplace. 
Decades later workers stumbled on the skeleton of one of the pit ponies that died during the accident and a full tub of coal that still bore a miners token (miners were on piece work). The miner then received his back pay.

====Disaster of 1940====
On 4 December 1940, a fall of stone on one of the work areas killed 5 miners. They were:
::::Joseph Welsh, 46
::::George W. Scott, 39
::::William Richardson, 50
::::William Smith, 40
::::John William Britton, 47

===Decline and eradication of mining===
As a result of the exhaustion of thick coal seams, only 1,500 tons of best quality coal was being produced a week in 1979. The last coal production was on 15 November 1985 and the colliery closed on 28 December 1985. As in many mining areas, the loss of the &#x27;pit&#x27; led to significant unemployment and related social problems. Sacriston narrowly avoided D classification in 1985 due to social deprivation and general poor quality of housing. Little evidence of the mining operations now remains, with the area around the former coal mine having been landscaped and turned into woodland. A few mining-related buildings do survive, the largest of which is now used as a depot for the local authority&#x27;s refuse vehicles, while the foundations of demolished mine buildings can be seen in places in the new woodland. Sacriston Wood is now a local nature reserve.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,613.

==Life in Sacriston today==
More than 25 years after the closure of its last coal mine, the village retains a strong sense of community. Recently, a new community centre has opened, and the village has started to shake off its coal mining past. The village has a travel agent and a Post Office along with a large number of shops for a village of its size, including mini-marts, a greengrocer, newsagent, barber shop, off-licence many takeaway shops and others. There are also two social clubs and similar organisations including Sacriston Working Mens Club and a Roman Catholic (now closed), cricket club and one remaining public house.

==Education==
The village has two schools, one of which is a Roman Catholic primary school, and the other is Sacriston Academy. Sacriston Academy opened on 1 September 2014 when, after a public consultation, the junior school closed and the infant school extended its age range and changed its name to Sacriston Academy.

The village used to have a secondary school, Fyndoune Community College. This school closed in 2021. 

There was another infant school that fed Sacriston Juniors called Plawsworth Road Infant School which closed in 2013 due to falling pupil numbers. It has since been demolished and houses were built on the site.

==Public services==
A new health centre, which includes a dental practice as well as a GP surgery, was officially opened by Sir Bobby Robson in 2008. This facility was constructed on the site of the village&#x27;s former swimming baths, which closed in the 1990s.

In July 2009 the Northern Integrative Health Practice (NIHP Sacriston Practice) opened in the vacated GP surgery building on Sacriston Crossroads. Offering services that complement traditional healthcare, the newly renovated building will also include an out-patients centre for Sunderland Eye Infirmary from January 2010.

==Notable people==
* Melvyn Betts (born 1975), ex Durham, Warwickshire and Middlesex cricketer, born in Sacriston.
* Ian Hunter (cricketer) (born 1979), ex Durham and now Derby cricketer, educated at Fyndoune Community College, Sacriston.

<doc id="982437" wikidata="Q2062087" url="?curid=982437" title="Paul Rutherford (singer)">
<text>Paul Rutherford (born 8 December 1959) is an English singer, musician and dancer. He is best known as the dancer, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the synth-pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

== Early life ==
Rutherford was born on 8 December 1959 in Liverpool, but moved to the Cantril Farm district as a child during the 1960s. He attended St Dominic&#x27;s Roman Catholic school in Huyton along with his twin sister.

== Career ==
Rutherford emerged from the 1970s punk scene in Merseyside, finding initial fame with St Helens&#x27; band the Spitfire Boys. The Spitfire Boys released the single &quot;British Refugees/Mein Kampf&quot;.

=== Frankie Goes to Hollywood ===
Rutherford, then member of Hambi and the Dance, joined Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1982 after he met them performing at &quot;Pickwicks, a pub in the centre of Liverpool&quot;. He sang backing vocals to Johnson and also danced, and provided some keyboard parts to the band&#x27;s recordings. The band ended five years later, and Rutherford attempted a solo career which was short-lived.

=== After Frankie Goes to Hollywood ===
Rutherford&#x27;s 1988 song &quot;Get Real&quot;, a collaboration with ABC, reached No. 47 in the UK and remained on the charts for four weeks.

Rutherford released a single, a cover of the Chic track &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, and an album, &quot;Oh World&quot;, in 1989, which were unsuccessful commercially. He released another single, &quot;That Moon&quot;, as Paul Rutherford with Pressure Zone in 1991, and worked as a stylist for bands. He appeared in the music videos for &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; (1992) by Annie Lennox and &quot;Give In to Me&quot; (1993) by Michael Jackson.

In late 2010, he released the album &quot;The Cowboy Years&quot; under the name Paul Rutherford/Butt Cowboys.

== Personal life ==
Rutherford and his civil union partner Perry live in New Zealand.

<text>In Anglican church music, a service is a musical setting of certain parts of the liturgy, generally for choir with or without organ accompaniment.

==Liturgical services==
===Morning Prayer===
*Venite (Psalm 95 — rarely set after the Restoration)
*Te Deum or Benedicite
*Benedictus (Luke I, 68) or Jubilate (Psalm 100)

===Evening Prayer===
*Magnificat or (rarely) Cantate Domino (Psalm 98)
*Nunc dimittis or (rarely) Deus misereatur (Psalm 67)

===Holy Communion===
*Responses to the Commandments
*Nicene Creed
*Sanctus
*Agnus Dei
*Kyrie Eleison
*Gloria in Excelsis

This follows the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Modern Anglican liturgy has largely reverted to the order of the Roman Catholic Mass. Unlike masses written in the Catholic tradition, however, masses by Anglican composers may choose to omit the Credo, which, in Anglican churches, is often recited rather than sung. Also, rather than setting the traditional Latin and Greek liturgy, several Anglican-composed masses use an English translation, such as that contained within the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.

==Full service and other services==
A &quot;Full Service&quot; includes all three of these groups. But with the demise of daily &quot;Matins&quot; (choral morning prayer) from the Anglican liturgy and the reduction of the choral element in communion services composers are now more likely only to set the evening service.

The &quot;Burial Service&quot; (see Requiem) is sometimes set separately.

==History==
In the Tudor and early Stuart periods, services were described as &quot;Short&quot;, &quot;Great&quot; or &quot;Verse&quot; services:
* Verse services incorporated sections for solo voices.
* Short services were simple settings for four-part choir which could be sung a cappella.
* Great Services (of which the most famous is the &quot;Great Service&quot; by William Byrd) were long and elaborate and presumably kept for special occasions.

Following the Restoration this classification gradually broke down and services became known by the key in which they were written; hence the common shorthand terminology &quot;Purcell in G minor&quot; or &quot;Stanford in B flat&quot;.

From the twentieth century, compositions are often named after the college chapel or cathedral for which they were written: examples are the &quot;Collegium Magdalenae Oxoniense&quot; of Kenneth Leighton for Magdalen College, Oxford and the &quot;Gloucester Service&quot; of Herbert Howells for Gloucester Cathedral.

<doc id="982441" wikidata="Q533034" url="?curid=982441" title="Battle of Westerplatte">
<text>The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of the German invasion of Poland, marking the start of World War II in Europe. It occurred on the Westerplatte peninsula in the harbour of the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland). A small forested island separated from Gdansk by the harbour channel, Westerplatte was established as a Polish military outpost during the interwar period.

In the mid-1920s, the Second Polish Republic established the Polish Military Transit Depot (, WST) on the Westerplatte peninsula in the Free City of Danzig. Beginning on 1 September 1939, the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and Danzig Police assaulted the WST. Despite initial assessment on both sides that the Polish garrison might hold out for several hours before being reinforced or overwhelmed, the Poles held out for seven days and repelled thirteen assaults that included dive-bomber attacks and naval shelling.

The defence of the Westerplatte was an inspiration for the Polish Army and people in the face of German advances elsewhere and is still regarded as a symbol of resistance in modern Poland. The Polish government is planning to open a dedicated public museum on the site in 2026.

==Background==
Westerplatte is a peninsula in the Bay of Gdańsk, which in 1939 was known as the Bay of Danzig. Following the re-establishment of Polish independence after World War I, much of the surrounding region became part of Poland. The city of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), historically an important port city, became an independent city-state, the Free City of Danzig. The Free City was nominally supervised by the League of Nations but Danzig became increasingly allied with Germany, reflecting its predominantly ethnic German population.

In 1921, in the wake of the Polish-Soviet War, the League of Nations granted Poland the right to install a garrisoned ammunition depot near Danzig. Despite objections from the Free City, this right was confirmed in 1925, and an area of was selected on the Westerplatte peninsula. Westerplatte was separated from the New Port of Danzig mainly by the harbour channel; on land, the Polish-held part of Westerplatte was separated from Danzig&#x27;s territory by a brick wall topped with barbed wire. A dedicated rail line, passing through the Free City, connected the depot with nearby Polish territory. The depot, referred to in League documents as the (WST) (), was completed in November 1925, officially transferred to Poland on the last day of that year, and became operational shortly after in January 1926, with 22 active storage warehouses. The Polish garrison&#x27;s complement was set at 2 officers, 20 NCOs, privates to a total strength of 88 all ranks, and Poland was prohibited construction of further military installations or fortifications on the site.

By early 1933, German politicians and media figures complained about the need for border adjustments. In addition, the Polish and French governments discussed the need for a preventive war against Germany. On 6 March, in what became known as the &quot;Westerplatte incident&quot; or &quot;crisis&quot;, the Polish government landed a marine battalion on Westerplatte, briefly reinforcing the WST garrison to about 200 men, demonstrating Polish resolve to defend the depot; the Polish manoeuvre was also intended to put pressure on the Danzig government, which was trying to renounce a prior agreement on shared Danzig-Polish control over the harbour police and to acquire full control of the police and the harbour. According to one source, on 14 March 1933, the League had authorized Poland to reinforce its garrison. However, according to another, the additional Polish troops were withdrawn on 16 March, following protests from the League, Danzig, and Germany but only in exchange for Danzig&#x27;s withdrawal of its objections to the harbour-police agreement.

Later, the Poles constructed clandestine fortifications on Westerplatte. These were relatively minor: there were no bunkers or tunnels, only several small guardhouses, partially hidden in the peninsula&#x27;s forest and several more buildings in the middle of the peninsula, including barracks. Most buildings were constructed with reinforced concrete and were supported by a network of field fortifications, including trenches, barricades and barbed wire.

==Prelude==
In March 1939, a German ultimatum to Lithuania led to Germany&#x27;s annexation of the nearby Lithuanian coastal Klaipėda region; subsequently, the Westerplatte garrison was placed on alert. Fearing a possible Nazi coup d&#x27;état in Danzig, the Poles decided secretly to reinforce their garrison and resorted to a subterfuge, civilians in Polish Army uniform would leave the base, and new Polish soldiers would enter it.

By late August 1939, the Poles had reinforced their 88-man garrison, though its strength is still debated; older sources speak of 182 men but more recent research suggests something in the range of 210 to 240, including six officers: Major Henryk Sucharski, his second-in-command Captain Franciszek Dąbrowski, Captain Mieczysław Słaby, Lieutenant Leon Pająk, Lieutenant , and Second Lieutenant . Estimates include some 20 mobilized civilians and about 10 regular troops who happened to be on site when fighting began. In addition to light arms consisting of pistols, grenades, and about 160 rifles, weaponry included a 75 mm field gun wz. 1902/26, two Bofors 37 mm anti-tank guns, four 81 mm mortars, and about 40 machine guns, including 18 heavy machine guns. Field fortifications were extended: more trenches were dug, wooden barricades were built, barbed wire was strung into wire obstacles, and reinforced concrete shelters were built into the basements of the barracks. Foliage was thinned to reduce cover on expected avenues of attack.

The Polish defence, which anticipated principally a German land-based assault, rested on three lines of defence. The outer line included entrenched outposts (codenamed &quot;Prom&quot;, &quot;Przystań&quot;, &quot;Łazienki&quot; and &quot;Wał&quot;) which were to hold long enough for the garrison to mobilize. The second line of defence centred on five guardhouses (numbered I to V) in the center of the depot. The final defence comprised the headquarters and barracks at the depot&#x27;s centre (sometimes referred to as Guardhouse VI). The Poles also had several supporting positions (&quot;Elektrownia&quot;, &quot;Deika&quot;, &quot;Fort&quot;, &quot;Tor kolejowy&quot; and &quot;Kej&quot;). The plan called for the garrison to hold out for 12 hours, after which the siege was expected to be lifted by reinforcements arriving from the mainland.

On 25 August 1939, the German pre-dreadnought battleship , under the pretext of making a courtesy call, sailed into Danzig harbour, anchoring from Westerplatte. On board was a &quot;Marinestosstruppkompanie&quot; (marine shock-troop company) of 225 marines under Lieutenant Wilhelm Henningsen. On land the Germans had the &quot;SS Heimwehr Danzig&quot; force of 1,500 men under Police General Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt. In overall command was Captain Gustav Kleikamp, aboard &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;. Initially, the marines were ordered to attack on the morning of 26 August 1939, on that day Kleikamp moved the battleship farther upstream, and as a result, Sucharski put his garrison on heightened alert. Shortly before the German disembarkation, the orders were rescinded as Adolf Hitler had postponed hostilities on learning of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, signed the day before, on 25 August 1939, and that Italy was hesitant about its obligations under the Pact of Steel.

Neither Eberhardt nor Kleikamp had specific information on the Polish defences. The Germans assumed that preliminary bombardment would soften up the fortifications enough for the marines to capture Westerplatte. Kleikamp had been assured by the Danzig Police that &quot;Westerplatte would be taken in 10 minutes.&quot; Eberhardt himself was more cautious, estimating that &quot;a few hours&quot; would be needed to overcome the Polish garrison, which the Germans estimated at no more than 100 men. The battle was fought at the semi - fortified supply depot on the Westerplatte peninsula at the mouth of the Vistula river north of Danzig (Gdansk).

==Battle==

On the early morning of 1 September 1939, &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; fired a broadside at the Polish garrison. That salvo&#x27;s time has been variously stated as 04:45, 04:47, or 04:48. Polish historian Jarosław Tuliszka explains that 04:45 was the planned time, 04:47 was the time the order was given by Kleikamp and 04:48 was the time the guns actually fired. Shortly after, on Westerplatte, Sucharski radioed the nearby Polish military base on the Hel Peninsula, &quot;SOS: I&#x27;m under fire.&quot; Other sources indicate the shot was fired at 04:00 rather than at or around 04:45. The battleship&#x27;s initial bombardment was not very successful, failing to inflict a single casualty among the defenders, as due to the battleship&#x27;s proximity to its target its heavier shells did not have time to arm and did not explode upon impact.

Eight minutes later Henningsen&#x27;s marines from the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;, who had disembarked two hours earlier on the eastern side of the peninsula, advanced, expecting an easy victory over the Poles. However, after crossing the artillery-breached brick wall at the border, advancing about , and engaging the Polish &quot;Prom&quot; outpost, the Germans ran into an ambush. They found themselves in a kill zone of Polish crossfire from concealed firing positions, while barbed-wire entanglements impeded their movements. Around 05:15, the field gun, commanded by Pająk, opened intense fire on the advancing Germans, firing 28 rounds and knocking out several machine-gun nests atop warehouses across the harbour canal. Meanwhile, the German infantry was also shelled by the Polish mortars, and even the battleship itself was targeted by the Polish 37 mm guns. Around that time, the Poles also repulsed an attempt by a small maritime unit of the Danzig Police to land on the western side of the depot. In that initial engagement, Poles sustained two casualties, and a Polish soldier, Staff Sergeant Wojciech Najsarek, was killed by machine-gun fire. Najsarek has been described as the first Polish combat casualty of the battle and perhaps of the war.

At 06:22, the German marines frantically radioed the battleship that they had sustained heavy losses and were withdrawing. Casualties were approximately fifty Germans and eight Poles, mostly wounded. A longer bombardment from the battleship, lasting from 07:40 to 08:55, preceded a second attack and succeeded at knocking out the Polish field gun. The Germans assaulted again from 08:35 to 12:30 but encountered mines, felled trees, barbed wire and intense fire. By noon, when the Germans retreated, Henningsen had been gravely wounded. Eberhardt requested air support, but it was delayed due to bad weather over Westerplatte. On that first day&#x27;s combat, the Polish side had sustained four killed and several wounded. The German marines had lost sixteen killed and a hundred and twenty wounded.
The German commanders concluded that a ground attack was not feasible until the Polish defences had been softened up. Re-examining aerial photographs, where they had previously underestimated the Polish defences, they now overestimated them, concluding the Poles had constructed extensive underground and armoured fortifications (six haystacks were declared to be armoured bunker domes). In the following days, the Germans bombarded the Westerplatte peninsula with naval and heavy field artillery, including a 105 mm howitzer battery and 210 mm howitzers. On 2 September, from 18:05 to 18:25, a two-wave air raid by 60 Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers dropped of bombs, eliminating the Polish mortars, destroying Guardhouse V with a bomb and killing at least eight Polish soldiers. The air raid shrouded all of Westerplatte in clouds of smoke and destroyed the Poles&#x27; only radio and much of their food supply. According to some German sources, after the air raid the Poles briefly displayed a white flag; but not all historians are convinced of this, and the German observers may have been mistaken.

On 4 September, a German torpedo boat, &quot;T196&quot;, supported by an old minesweeper, the &quot;Von der Gronen&quot;, made a surprise attack. The Poles&#x27; &quot;Wał&quot; outpost had been abandoned. Now only the &quot;Fort&quot; outpost prevented an attack from the north. Though the Poles never landed a hit on the German naval units, &quot;T196&quot; and &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; suffered accidents due to crew error or equipment failure, with at least one fatality and several injured men on the battleship.

On 5 September, Sucharski held a conference with his officers, during which he urged surrender: the post had only been supposed to hold out for twelve hours. His deputy, Dąbrowski, opposed surrender and the group decided to hold out a while longer.
Subsequently, the Poles repelled several cautious German probing attacks. At 03:00 on 6 September, during one of the attacks, the Germans sent a burning train toward the Polish positions, but the ploy failed when the terrified driver decoupled prematurely. The train failed to reach its target, an oil cistern; instead, it set fire to the woods, which had provided the Poles with valuable cover. In addition, the burning wagons created a perfect field of fire; the Germans suffered heavy losses. A second fire-train attack, in the afternoon, also failed.

At a second conference with his officers, on 6 September, Sucharski was again ready to surrender: the German Army was by now outside Warsaw, and Westerplatte was running critically low on supplies; moreover, many of the wounded were suffering from gangrene. At 04:30 on 7 September, the Germans opened intense fire on Westerplatte which lasted till 07:00. Flamethrowers and bombardment destroyed Guardhouse II and damaged Guardhouses I and IV. &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; took part in the bombardments.

At 09:45 on 7 September 1939, a white flag appeared. The Polish defence had so impressed the Germans that their commander, Eberhardt, initially let Sucharski keep his ceremonial &quot;szabla&quot; (Polish saber) in captivity although it would be confiscated later. Contemporary English-language publications which reported on the event, such as &quot;Life&quot; and the &quot;Pictorial History of the War&quot;, misidentified the Polish commander as a Major &quot;Koscianski&quot;.

Sucharski surrendered the post to Kleikamp, and the Germans stood at attention as the Polish garrison marched out at 11:30. Over 3,000 Germans, including soldiers and support formations such as the Danzig Police, had been tied up in the week-long operation against the small Polish garrison; about half of the Germans (570 on land, over 900 at sea) had taken part in direct action. German casualties totalled 50 killed (16 from the Kriegsmarine) and 150 wounded. The Poles had lost 15 men and had sustained at least 40 wounded.

==Aftermath==
On 8 September, the day after the capitulation, the Germans discovered a grave with the bodies of four unidentified Polish soldiers who had been executed by their comrades for attempted desertion. According to Tomasz Sudoł this had likely taken place following the 2 September air raids. Five days after the capitulation, on 12 September 1939, the Polish wireless operator, Sergeant Kazimierz Rasiński, was murdered by the Germans. He was shot after brutal interrogation during which he refused to hand over radio codes. On 19 September Hitler came to visit Danzig. While there, on 21 September, he inspected Westerplatte.

Westerplatte saw another round of fighting during the Vistula–Oder Offensive in 1945. From 28 March to 1 April, elements of the German 73rd Infantry Division defended the peninsula from the Soviet 76th Guards Rifle Division until the German units were evacuated by sea.

== Significance ==
The Battle of Westerplatte is often described as the opening battle of World War II, but it was only one of many battles in the first phase of the German invasion of Poland known as the Battle of the Border. British historian I. C. B. Dear described the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;&#x27;s salvos as having occurred &quot;minutes after Luftwaffe attacks on Polish airfields&quot; and other targets. A bridge in nearby Tczew had been bombed around 04:30, and the false-flag Operation Himmler had begun hours earlier.

The Polish historian Krzysztof Komorowski writes that &quot;Westerplatte has become one of the symbols of the Polish struggle for independence, and is inscribed in the list of the most heroic battles of modern Europe.&quot;

For both sides, the battle had mostly political, rather than tactical, importance. It tied up substantial German forces for much longer than anyone had expected, preventing &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; from lending fire support in the nearby battles of Hel and Gdynia.

Westerplatte&#x27;s defence inspired the Polish Army and people even as German advances continued elsewhere; beginning on 1 September 1939, Polish Radio repeatedly broadcast the phrase that made Westerplatte an important symbol: &quot;Westerplatte broni się jeszcze&quot; (&quot;Westerplatte fights on&quot;). On 16 September Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński penned a poem, &quot;&quot;, voicing a subsequent myth that all of Westerplatte&#x27;s defenders had died in the battle, fighting to the last man. The battle became a symbol of resistance to the invasion – a Polish Battle of Thermopylae. As early as 1943, a Polish People&#x27;s Army unit was named for Westerplatte&#x27;s soldiers (the Polish 1st Armoured Brigade of the Defenders of Westerplatte). That same year, the Polish Underground State named a street after Westerplatte; and the following year, during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, an insurgent stronghold was named &quot;Westerplatte&quot;.

== Controversy ==
Controversy surrounds the Polish garrison&#x27;s commanding officer, Sucharski. Early historiography considered him to have been in command throughout the battle, and so early accounts portrayed him as a heroic figure. More recent accounts from the early 1990s have presented evidence that Sucharski&#x27;s officers had vowed not to disclose in their lifetimes that their commander had been shell-shocked for most of the battle and had advocated surrender as early as 2 September and several times thereafter and that his second-in-command, Dąbrowski, had effectively taken command following Sucharski&#x27;s breakdown on the second day of the siege.

Sucharski&#x27;s conduct is still debated by historians.

== Remembrance ==
Westerplatte is a common venue for state remembrance ceremonies relating to World War II, usually held on 1 September. They are generally attended by high-ranking Polish politicians such as Prime Minister Donald Tusk (2014), President Bronisław Komorowski (2015), President Andrzej Duda (2016), and Prime Minister Beata Szydło (2017). The commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, in 2009, was attended by Tusk, former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, and former Presidents Lech Wałęsa and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, as well as by important figures from about 20 other countries, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and French Prime Minister François Fillon.

The Battle of Westerplatte has been the subject of two Polish films: &quot;Westerplatte&quot; (1967), and &quot;Tajemnica Westerplatte&quot; (The Secret of Westerplatte, 2013). It has also inspired dozens of books and scores of press articles, scholarly studies, and fictional works, as well as poems, songs, paintings, and other works of art.

=== Tourist attraction ===
The Polish 75 mm field gun became one of Germany&#x27;s first war trophies of World War II, displayed on a column at Flensburg. After the war, it was moved to stand before the Naval Academy Mürwik.

Westerplatte&#x27;s Guardhouses I, III and IV, the power plant, and the barracks survived the war. In 1946, a and a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier were established on the peninsula; the cemetery was placed near the destroyed Guardhouse V. During the early postwar Stalinist era, Westerplatte was presented as a symbol of Poland&#x27;s prewar anticommunist government and was marginalised in official history; Mieczysław Słaby, the garrison surgeon at Westerplatte, was arrested, tortured and died in the custody of the Ministry of Public Security in 1948. After the mid-1950s liberalization, Westerplatte was repurposed as a communist propaganda symbol; in 1956, the Polish Naval Academy was named for the &quot;Heroes of Westerplatte&quot;, and that name began to be given to schools, streets, and other institutions. In 1962 a Christian cross at the cemetery was replaced with a Soviet T-34 tank, and the first government-organized remembrances began at Westerplatte. In 1966, a Westerplatte Monument, a -tall obelisk atop a mound, was erected at Westerplatte, set within a park, with smaller installations. Westerplatte became a popular tourist attraction. Later, Guardhouse I was relocated in order to save it from destruction during the construction of a new harbour channel. In 1971, Sucharski&#x27;s grave was relocated to Westerplatte from his original burial place in Italy. In 1974, a small museum was opened in the renovated Guardhouse I. Since the 1980s, Westerplatte has been administered by the National Museum in Gdańsk. In 1981, the cross was restored to the cemetery. In June 1987, Westerplatte was visited by Pope John Paul II; his visit is commemorated by a plaque unveiled in 2015.

Following the fall of communism in Eastern and Central Europe, a change symbolic of Poland&#x27;s political transformation was the 2007 transfer of the Soviet T-34 tank from the cemetery to a museum in another town. In 2001, the Polish government recognised Westerplatte&#x27;s ruins as an object of cultural heritage. On 1 September 2003, the site was designated an official Historic Monument. In the mid-2010s, the Polish government decided to create a dedicated , commemorating the 1939 battle; as of 2019, the museum was planned to be opened in 2026.

<text>The Light and the Dark is the fourth novel in C. P. Snow&#x27;s &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; series. The book portrays narrator Lewis Eliot&#x27;s friendship with Roy Calvert, and Calvert&#x27;s inner turmoil and quest for meaning in life. Calvert was based on Snow&#x27;s friend, Coptic scholar, Charles Allberry. Their relationship is developed further in &quot;The Masters&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==
Set in England in the lead-up to and during World War II, it portrays Lewis Eliot&#x27;s friendship with the gifted scholar and remarkable individual Roy Calvert, and Calvert&#x27;s inner turmoil and quest for meaning in life.

==Title==
The title—The Light and the Dark—refers to the beliefs of Manichaeism, which the book refers to as &quot;Christian heresy&quot; but is now often referred to as religion in its own right. &quot;In its cosmology, the whole of cosmology is a battle of the light against the dark. Man&#x27;s spirit is part of the light, and his flesh of the dark.&quot; The title also has resonance to the buildup to war, the sense of catastrophe so widespread in the 1930s, and Calvert&#x27;s mental health problems.

==Reception==
In 1947, a book review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book &quot;A rather long drawn out search of a brilliant scholar to escape his doom of despair and find a meaning in his life.&quot; and summarized; &quot;Good writing and interesting characterizations fail to keep the book from tedious periods.&quot;

<text>Movement disorders are clinical syndromes with either an excess of movement or a paucity of voluntary and involuntary movements, unrelated to weakness or spasticity. Movement disorders present with extrapyramidal symptoms and are caused by basal ganglia disease. Movement disorders are conventionally divided into two major categories- &quot;hyperkinetic&quot; and &quot;hypokinetic&quot;.

Hyperkinetic movement disorders refer to dyskinesia, or excessive, often repetitive, involuntary movements that intrude upon the normal flow of motor activity.

Hypokinetic movement disorders fall into one of four subcategories: akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movements), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is a manifestation of another systemic or neurological disorder. Treatment depends upon the underlying disorder.

== Classification ==
== Diagnosis ==
Step I : Decide the dominant type of movement disorder

Step II : Make differential diagnosis of the particular disorder

Step II: Confirm the diagnosis by lab tests
* Metabolic screening
* Microbiology
* Immunology
* CSF examination
* Genetics
* Imaging
* Neurophysiological tests
* Pharmacological tests

== History ==
Vesalius and Piccolomini in 16th century distinguished subcortical nuclei from cortex and white matter. However Willis&#x27; conceptualized the corpus striatum as the seat of motor power in the late 17th century. In mid-19th-century movement disorders were localized to striatum by Choreaby Broadbent and Jackson, and athetosis by Hammond. By the late 19th century, many movement disorders were described, but for most no pathologic correlate was known.

<text>The  (&quot;Head Watch&quot;, or &quot;Civic guard headquarters&quot;) is a historically important . It was built in the 13th century and it is considered the oldest building in Haarlem, Netherlands. It has served as a printshop for Coornhert, as a temporary council meeting location across from City Hall and even as a jail. It is located on the across from the St. Bavochurch.

==History==
From 1250 to around 1350 the building served as the first city hall of Haarlem. After the current city hall was built across the square, various important families lived in the house. The lower part of the building was used as a printing shop, a general store and for storing beer. Though it had lost its official function, as a large and imposing building in medieval Haarlem, it continued to be used for council meetings whenever the Count of Holland was visiting. A plaque above the door states:

This text in old Dutch says that whenever the Count &quot;planted his court here on the sand&quot; (meaning when he stayed in the large &quot;Gravenzaal&quot; or Count&#x27;s hall across the square), this honorable building was put to use as the courthouse. The humanist Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert once ran a printshop from the basement in the 16th century. The baroque facade is newer and dates from circa 1650.

On May 17, 1755 the building was bought by the municipality to serve as headquarters for the civic guard (&quot;). This is the reason for the building&#x27;s current name. Each evening and morning the gates of the city would be unlocked by the militia who lived here.

==Town Jail==
Until the Spaarne prison was built on the east side of the river (known as the &quot;) in 1899, there were a few jail rooms upstairs here. Before 1755, prisoners were kept in the cellar of the city hall across the street, which was often quite damp, but open to the street level and allowed some exchange with townsfolk in the rear alleyway. After sentencing, prisoners received public humiliation though corporal punishment such as branding, eye gouging, or execution, but for minor crimes they were sent to the &quot;Tuchthuis&quot;, the local workhouse. Coornhert wrote the first treatise on criminals and pleaded for more humane treatment. The latter 17th century saw some reforms and a restriction in public executions, which came to be seen as barbaric.

After 1755, keeping the prisoners upstairs significantly improved their living conditions, but it also saw a change in the purpose of their stay, as they had no contact anymore with the outside world. Before this change, prisoners were only held until sentencing, and their stay in jail was relatively short and not considered part of their punishment. With abolishment of public displays of corporal punishment, there was no solution for convicted felons that were not suited for the workhouse. For these prisoners, imprisonment became their punishment, but there was no longer any need to house them near the courthouse or near the Grote Markt. This building could not house longer term prisoners and thus the jail function was moved.

==Sentinel post==
For a short period the Hoofdwacht was in use as a military hospital, where Antonius Mathijsen made his discovery of the orthopedic plaster cast in 1851.
The upstairs was also the place where the watchmen would stand guard near the balcony. The church opposite had a sentry lookout posted in the steeple who could signal the guards on the balcony using red flags so that the guards in the Hoofdwacht could react to fires or other unrest. This sentry position was still in use in 1919.

Since 1919 the building has been occupied by the Haarlem historical association &quot;&quot;, which uses it today for its meetings and small public exhibitions on the history of Haarlem. From May to September it is open to the public as a free &quot;mini-museum&quot; on weekend afternoons from 1:00-5:00 PM.

<text>Haarlem railway station is located in Haarlem in North Holland, Netherlands. The station opened at September 20, 1839, on the Amsterdam–Rotterdam railway, the first railway line in the Netherlands. The station building itself is a &quot;rijksmonument&quot;.

==History==
The original, wooden station was built on the Oude Weg, just outside the Amsterdamse Poort in 1839 to accommodate the passengers of the first railway in the Netherlands between Haarlem and Amsterdam. This had a broad gauge rail width of the Dutch broad gauge . The station was built outside the city, on the current location of the &quot;Centrale Werkplaats&quot; (maintenance depot) of the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij.

At great expense, the track gauge was reduced in 1866 to in order to conform to George Stephenson&#x27;s standard gauge. The train engine &quot;De Snelheid&quot; was the twin of the &quot;Arend&quot;, which along with the carriages, were designed by Stephenson&#x27;s apprentice, the English rail engineer Thomas Longridge Gooch of R.B. Longridge &amp; Co. There were 4 trains per day to Amsterdam, scheduled at 9:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00. The prices of the tickets for 1st (closed carriage), 2nd, and 3rd class (charabanc) were 1.20, 80c, and 40c (guilders).
Within a few years the new railway turned out to be a great success, and in 1842 a permanent station was built on the current location. It was designed by Frederick Willem Conrad in a semi-Greek neo-classicistic style. The front of the building was open to the street. 

===Mouthaan===
In 1867 the station was re-designed by P.J. Mouthaan. An extra floor was put on the building and the front of the building was enclosed.

===Current station===

The current building was built between 1906 and 1908. The design is by the railway station specialist Dirk Margadant (1849-1915). The tracks were elevated, to avoid conflict with the traffic in the city. It is the only train station in the Netherlands that is built in Art Nouveau style.

==Train services==

As of 9 December 2018, the following services call at Haarlem:

=== International rail ===
=== National rail ===
==Bus services==

==Gallery==
==In Popular culture==
The scenes in the 2004 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; that are meant to portray Amsterdam Centraal station were actually shot on platform 3a at Haarlem station.

<text>12 Stones is an American hard rock band, formed in 2000 in Mandeville, Louisiana consisting of Paul McCoy, Eric Weaver, Sean Dunaway, and Jon Rodriguez.

==History==
The band members met in Mandeville, Louisiana, a small city north of New Orleans, and within 15 months were signed to a record deal with Wind-up Records. Lead vocalist Paul McCoy was featured in the Evanescence single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, released in 2003, which later went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2004.

Songs from the band have appeared in various films and TV shows. &quot;My Life&quot;, from their self-titled album, was featured on the soundtrack of the 2002 film &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. &quot;Broken&quot; (also from the self-titled album) served as the official theme song for WWE&#x27;s WWE Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2002. &quot;Home&quot; (also from the self-titled album) was the song used for the WWE Desire video for Kurt Angle. &quot;Shadows&quot;, from &quot;Potter&#x27;s Field&quot;, was used in a trailer for the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;. &quot;Photograph&quot; (also from &quot;Potter&#x27;s Field&quot;) appeared on the soundtrack of the 2005 film &quot;Elektra&quot;. The band also recorded the song &quot;Let Go&quot; exclusively for the &quot;Daredevil&quot; movie . Songs &quot;Running out of Pain&quot; and &quot;Back Up&quot; were used on &quot;Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story&quot;.

In November 2009, the band recorded their fourth studio album, with producer David Bendeth. &quot;We Are One&quot;, the first single from the new album, was released on April 6. The song Premiered on noisecreep on March 29, 2010.

&quot;We Are One&quot; was used by WWE as the theme song for the renegade faction formed by the &quot;NXT&quot; first season graduates known as The Nexus. The song also was used as the opening to each ACC Network telecast of the 2011 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The Washington Capitals hockey team also used the song in the 2010–11 NHL season video played at the start of their home games in the Verizon Center.

On August 24, 2010, the band announced that they were leaving Wind-Up after nine years, stating &quot;We felt it was time for a change. We have a vision for this band that we feel is best pursued elsewhere.&quot;

12 Stones then signed a record deal with Executive Music Group. The band released their new album &quot;Beneath the Scars&quot; on May 22, 2012, to digital retailers, however it wasn&#x27;t released to stores until May 29, 2012.

A distinction is usually made between the &quot;Begijnenhofjes&quot; and &#x27;regular&#x27; . The former were used only by (Catholic) women, who were supporting themselves. They were a kind of cloister. The latter were more charitable institutions. 
To be eligible to live in a one had to meet four criteria:
# Sex: almost all were founded for women, as they could be relied on to keep a household running; although for men and married couples did exist
# Religion: many were founded for people of the same faith as the founder (some were founded by church communities)
# Age: from the 17th century a minimum age was often used. Fifty years was common, and this was an old age in those years
# Social-economic background: were targeted for poorer people

In the 18th century some were founded for commercial purposes; the inhabitants would pay rent.

<doc id="982472" wikidata="Q2576807" url="?curid=982472" title="Irish Socialist Republican Party">
<text>The Irish Socialist Republican Party was a small but pivotal Irish political party founded in 1896 by James Connolly. Its aim was to establish an Irish workers&#x27; republic. The party split in 1904 following months of internal political rows.

==History==
The party was small throughout its existence. According to ISRP historian David Lynch, the party never had more than 80 active members. Upon its founding one journalist commented that the party had more syllables than members. The party emerged out of the Dublin Socialist Club when a motion was put forward at Pierce Ryan&#x27;s pub on Thomas Street, Dublin to form 
a party. Connolly and six others were present at inaugural meeting.

Nevertheless, the ISRP is regarded by many Irish historians as a party of seminal importance in the early history of Irish socialism and republicanism. It is often described as the first socialist and republican party in Ireland, and the first organisation to espouse the ideology of socialist republicanism on the island. During its lifespan it only had one really active branch, the Dublin one. There were several attempts to create branches in Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Naas, and even in northern England but they never came to much. The party established links with feminist and revolutionary Maud Gonne who approved of the party.

The party produced the first regular socialist paper in Ireland, the &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;, ran candidates in local elections, represented Ireland at the Second International, and agitated over issues such as the Boer War and the 1798 commemorations. Politically the ISRP was before its time, putting the call for an independent &quot;Republic&quot; at the centre of its propaganda before Sinn Féin or others had done so.

A public meeting held by the party is described in Irish socialist playwright Sean O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Drums under the Window&quot;.

In 1900 it sent delegates to the International Socialist Congress of the Second International in Paris, representing Ireland instead of Britain. It also became involved in the campaign against the Boer War.

Connolly, who was the full-time paid organiser for the party, subsequently left Ireland for the United States in 1903 following internal conflict; in fact it seems to have been a combination of the petty infighting and his own poverty that caused Connolly to abandon Ireland (he returned in 1910). Connolly had clashed with the party&#x27;s other leading light, E. W. Stewart, over trade union and electoral strategy. A small number of members around Stewart established an anti-Connolly micro organisation called the Irish Socialist Labour Party. In 1904, this merged with the remains of the ISRP to form the Socialist Party of Ireland.

<doc id="982474" wikidata="Q6981814" url="?curid=982474" title="Naval Flight Officer insignia">
<text>The Naval Flight Officer insignia is a breast insignia of the United States military which is awarded to those aviators of the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard who have qualified as Naval Flight Officers (NFO) based on successful completion of flight training. The insignia is similar in design to the Naval Aviator insignia, consisting of a pair of golden wings, a shield, and crossed anchors.

The Naval Flight Officer insignia is identical for all three branches and is awarded in a single degree. To qualify for the NFO insignia, a service member must have completed officer aviation training and be qualified as a systems operator on board a Naval aircraft. Such qualifications include weapons system operations, airborne tactical data system operations, electronic warfare, and airborne navigation.

The insignia originated in the 1930s and evolved from the Naval Aviation Observer insignia. The main reason for creating the NFO insignia in 1965-1966 was to recognize the higher degree of training required for naval flight officers, compared to other airborne support personnel.

In the modern space age, the insignia is also upgradeable to a variation of the Naval Aviator Astronaut insignia. Known as the Naval Flight Officer Astronaut insignia, the decoration is a standard NFO insignia upon which is centered a golden astronaut &quot;shooting star&quot; logo. The badge is issued for those Naval Flight Officers who have completed astronaut training at NASA and have subsequently participated in a space flight more than 50 miles above the Earth.
Previously, the United States Coast Guard equivalent of the Naval Flight Officer insignia was known as the Coast Guard Flight Officer Badge. It was similar in appearance to the NFO wings (minus the crossed anchors) and was declared obsolete in 1991.

<doc id="982477" wikidata="Q5152565" url="?curid=982477" title="Commercial lender (U.S.)">
<text>In the United States a commercial lender offers loans backed by hard collateral. In most cases this is real estate, but it can also include factoring, non-conforming assets, or other sources of collateral.

==Commercial lending practices==
Commercial lenders include commercial banks, mutual companies, private lending institutions, hard money lenders and other financial groups. These lenders typically have widely varying standards on which they base their loan criteria and evaluate potential borrowers—but are often focused exclusively on the private market and have more lenient financial qualifications than banks.

Commercial lenders specialize in hard money and bridge loans, often those that close quickly, in as little as two weeks. The commercial loan industry is most often accessed through commercial brokers, who provide an evaluation of a borrower and then recommend the loan to a number of different commercial lenders whom they feel will be most likely to fund the borrower&#x27;s request. Going through a broker rather than directly through a lender may cause longer wait times for loan financing and more up-front fees. However, they can greatly facilitate the process and come up with innovative and unique ways to overcome obstacles that the borrower may not be able to access on their own.

==Costs of commercial lenders==
Commercial lenders weigh the type, quality, and equity of the hard collateral very heavily. They provide the borrower with the greatest flexibility but also the highest rates when compared with bank loans. Many commercial loans are bridge loans where a higher rate is a good trade off for the speed with which the loan is delivered and the flexibility of the finance terms behind it.

==Commercial lending industry==
Thanks to freedom from regulation, the commercial lending industry operates with particular speed and responsiveness, making it an attractive option for those seeking quick funding. However, this has also created a highly predatory lending environment where many companies refer loans to one another (brokering), increasing the price and loan points with each referral.

There is also great concern about the practices of some lending companies in the industry who require upfront payments to investigate loans and refuse to lend on virtually all properties while keeping this fee. Borrowers are advised not to work with hard money lenders who require exorbitant upfront fees prior to funding in order to reduce this risk.

===Commercial lenders and loan terms===
In recent years there have been some significant advances. A good example is that credit unions are now allowed to engage in commercial lending with only minor restrictions. Most notable among those restrictions is that credit unions are prohibited in most cases from lending more than 80% of the value of real property. This is done to protect credit union members from excessive risk and is a common practice in the industry as a whole, although not enforced. On the other hand, credit unions are cooperatives and can therefore offer competitive advantages over other institutions in regards to rate and other terms.

Most commercial lenders prefer to offer terms for shorter periods of time than residential lenders might at thirty or so years. Commercial lenders sometimes offer a five or ten-year loan with a payout based on longer, thereby leaving a balloon payment due at the loan expiration. That often requires the property owner to come up with the balloon payment himself, or to refinance or sell.

Additionally a commercial lender might attempt to charge a &quot;pre-payment penalty&quot; in order to guarantee a certain return, in the event the loan is not kept for the full term. Frequently pre-payment penalties range between one and five years and are for an amount of interest or number of months such as frequently will be seen a &quot;six month interest guarantee&quot; etc.

===Commercial bridge loan===
Commercial bridge loans are sometimes referred to as short term financing, bridge financing or even hard money. Bridge loans are easy to qualify for as long as there is equity remaining in the property sufficient to cover the commercial lender&#x27;s risk capital.

Commercial bridge lenders will overlook property issues, incomplete permits, credit and other problems in exchange for a higher rate of return. However they will look to offset that risk by lending at a lower loan to value ratio usually of under 65% of the property&#x27;s value.

<doc id="982478" wikidata="Q44811" url="?curid=982478" title="Gagra">
<text>Gagra (; Abkhaz and Russian: Гагра) is a town in Abkhazia/Georgia, sprawling for 5 km on the northeast coast of the Black Sea, at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains. Its subtropical climate made Gagra a popular health resort in Imperial Russian and Soviet times.

It had a population of 26,636 in 1989, but this has declined considerably as a result of ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia and other demographic shifts during and after the War in Abkhazia (1992–93).

Gagra is the center of the district of the same name. It is located in the western part of the region of Abkhazia, and the Psou River serves as the border with the Krasnodar Krai of Russia.

== Etymology ==
According to a number of Georgian scholars, &quot;Gagra&quot; is derived from &quot;Gakra&quot; meaning &quot;walnut&quot; in the Svan language, while &quot;Gakari/Kakari&quot; means &quot;a place with walnut trees&quot;, which is in accordance to toponym used in old maps. The name of the city is claimed by Z. Danelia to originate from the Gagaa family, who, according to Danelia, once lived there. However, the historicity of the Gagaa family and its connection to the city is disputed due to lack of evidence. According to V. Kvarchia, the name &quot;Gagra&quot; is derived from a combination of two Abkhaz words: &quot;a-ga&quot; (&quot;coast&quot;) and &quot;a-kra&quot; (&quot;to close&quot;), that is, &quot;a place where the shore is closed&quot;. According to Z. Anchabadze, etymology of the city is derived from &quot;Gagrifshi.&quot; The term &quot;Gak&quot; or &quot;Kak&quot; is considered a personal name, while the affix &quot;-ri&quot; denotes possession. Additionally, the affix &quot;-fsh-&quot; is interpreted as indicating &quot;the importance of the place.&quot;

== History ==
The town was established as a Greek colony in the kingdom of Colchis, called Triglite (), inhabited by Greeks and Colchians. Colchis came under the control of the kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC before being absorbed by the Roman Empire, which renamed the town as &quot;Nitica&quot;. Its geographical position led the Romans to fortify the town, which was repeatedly attacked by Goths and other invaders. The town and the whole region of Colchis remained part of Byzantine Empire.

It became a major trading settlement in which Genoese and Venetian merchants were prominent, trading in the town&#x27;s main exports – wood, honey, wax and slaves. The name &quot;Gagra&quot; appeared for the first time on a map in 1308, on a map of the Caucasus made by the Italian Pietro Visconti, which is now in the Library of Saint Mark in Venice.

=== Gagra within the Russian Empire ===

In the 16th century, Gagra and the rest of western Georgia were conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The western merchants were expelled and the town entered a prolonged period of decline, with much of the local population fleeing into the mountains. By the 18th century, the town had been reduced to little more than a village surrounded by forests and disease-ridden swamps. Its fortunes were restored in the 19th century when the Russian Empire expanded into the region, annexing the whole of Georgia. The swamps were drained and the town was rebuilt around a new military hospital. Its population, however, was still small; in 1866, a census recorded that 336 men and 280 women, mostly local families or army officers and their dependents, lived in Gagra. The town suffered badly in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878, when Turkish troops invaded, destroyed the town and expelled the local population. Russia won the war, however, and rebuilt Gagra again. 

In 1904 the town was discovered by Duke Alexander of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian royalty. He saw the potential of the region&#x27;s sub-tropical climate and decided to build a high-class resort there. Having raised a large sum of money from the government, he built a palace there for himself and constructed a number of other buildings in an eclectic variety of architectural styles from around Europe. A park was laid out with tropical trees, and parrots and monkeys were imported to give it an exotic feel. Despite the expensive work, the resort was not initially a success, although it did later attract a growing number of foreign tourists visiting on cruises of the Black Sea. Following the founding of the resort, the area was ceded from Sukhum Okrug to Black Sea Governorate in 1904.

=== Gagra under the Soviet Union ===
In the Russian Revolution of 1905, a local uprising produced a revolutionary government in the town, which founded a short-lived Republic of Gagra. This was soon defeated and the revolutionaries were arrested &quot;en masse&quot;. The First World War a few years later was a disaster for Gagra, destroying the tourist trade on which it depended. The Russian Revolution shortly afterwards saw the Bolsheviks take over the town; despite a brief French attempt to repel them during the Russian Civil War, the town was firmly incorporated into the new Soviet Union within Georgian SSR.

Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin issued a decree in 1919 establishing a &quot;worker&#x27;s resort&quot; in Gagra, nationalising the resort that had been built by Oldenburg. It became a popular holiday resort for Soviet citizens and during World War II gained a new role as a site for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. After the war, various state-run sanatoriums were built there. The resort grew and was developed intensively as part of the &quot;Soviet Riviera&quot;. A 1985 musical film &quot;Winter Evening in Gagra&quot; further popularized the resort.
=== Gagra in post-soviet Abkhazia ===
In the late 1980s, tensions grew between the Georgian and Abkhazian communities in the region. An all-out war erupted between 1992 and 1993 which ended in a defeat of the Georgian government&#x27;s forces. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians were expelled from their homes in Abkhazia and thousands were massacred in an outbreak of mass ethnic cleansing. Gagra and the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi were at the centre of the fighting and suffered heavy damage. To this date ethnic Georgians have an IDP status and have not been able to return to their homes.

<doc id="982480" wikidata="Q235347" url="?curid=982480" title="John Carter (film)">
<text>John Carter is a 2012 American science fiction action-adventure film directed by Andrew Stanton, written by Stanton, Mark Andrews, and Michael Chabon, and based on &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, the first book in the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Produced by Jim Morris, Colin Wilson and Lindsey Collins, it stars Taylor Kitsch in the title role, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds, Dominic West, James Purefoy and Willem Dafoe. It chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of John Carter and his attempts to mediate civil conflict amongst the warring kingdoms of Barsoom.

Several attempts to adapt the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series had been made since the 1930s by various major studios and producers. Most of these efforts ultimately stalled in development hell. In the late-2000s, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort to adapt Burroughs&#x27; works to film, after an abandoned venture in the 1980s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the screen rights from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became the new film&#x27;s director in 2009. It was his live-action debut, after his directorial work for Disney on the Pixar animated films &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot;. Filming began in November 2009, with principal photography underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July. Michael Giacchino, who scored many Pixar films, composed the music. Like Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot; that same year, the film is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, who was CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar prior to Disney&#x27;s acquisition in 2006.

It was released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on March 9, 2012, marking the centennial of the titular character&#x27;s first appearance. It was presented in Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. &quot;John Carter&quot; received mixed reviews, with praise for its visuals, Giacchino&#x27;s score, and the action sequences, but criticism of the characterization and plot. It failed at the North American box office, but set an opening-day record in Russia. It grossed $284 million at the worldwide box office, resulting in a $200 million writedown for Disney, becoming one of the biggest box office bombs in history and also becoming the film with the largest estimated box-office loss adjusted for inflation ever, losing $149–265 million. With a total cost of $350 million, including an estimated production budget of $263 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Due to its box office performance, Disney cancelled plans for &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;Warlord of Mars,&quot; the rest of the trilogy Stanton had planned. Much of the film&#x27;s failure has been attributed to its promotion, which has been called &quot;one of the worst marketing campaigns in movie history&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1881, Edgar Rice Burroughs attends the funeral of his uncle, John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain who died suddenly. Per Carter&#x27;s instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney gives Carter&#x27;s personal journal to Burroughs to read.

In a flashback to 1868 in the Arizona Territory, Union Colonel Powell arrests Carter with hopes that Carter will help in fighting local Apache. Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they hide in a cave that turns out to be filled with gold. A Thern appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern&#x27;s powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, Barsoom, known to Carter as Mars. Because of his different bone density and the planet&#x27;s low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Tharks, a nomadic tribe of Green Martians and their Jeddak, Tars Tarkas.

Elsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter.

Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas&#x27;s daughter, Sola, reach a spot in a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back to Earth. They discover that the medallions are powered by a &quot;ninth ray&quot; that is also the source of Sab Than&#x27;s weapon. They are then attacked by a vicious race called the Warhoon under the direction of Shang. Carter and Dejah are taken back to Zodanga. A demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than and gives Carter instructions on how to use the medallion to return to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different worlds to their doom, feeding off the planet&#x27;s resources in the process, and intend to do the same thing with Barsoom by choosing Sab Than to rule the planet. Carter goes back to the Tharks with Sola to request their help. There they discover a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus, has overthrown Tarkas. Carter and an injured Tarkas battle with two enormous Great White-Apes in an arena before Carter kills Hajus, thereby becoming the leader of the Tharks.

The Thark army storms Zodanga, realizing their army is waiting outside Helium, John and the Tharks commandeer the Zodangan airships and fly to Helium. Carter defeats the Zodangan army, while Sab Than is killed and Shang is forced to escape. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang briefly reappears and gives Carter another challenge, sending him back to Earth. Carter embarks on a long quest to find one of their medallions on Earth; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state, and makes Burroughs his protector.

Back in the present, Burroughs runs back to Carter&#x27;s tomb and uses clues to open it. Just as he does so, a Thern appears and raises a weapon before Carter appears and shoots the Thern in the back. He reveals that he had never found another medallion; instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern from hiding, thus winning Shang&#x27;s challenge. Carter then uses the dead Thern&#x27;s medallion to return to Barsoom.

==Development==
===Origins===
The film is largely based on &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; (1912), the first in a series of 11 Burroughs novels to feature the interplanetary hero John Carter (and in later volumes the adventures of his children with Dejah Thoris). The story was originally serialized in six monthly installments (from February through to July 1912) in the pulp magazine &quot;The All-Story&quot;; those chapters, originally titled &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot;, were then collected as a novel and published in hardcover five years later from A. C. McClurg.

===Bob Clampett involvement===
In 1931, director Bob Clampett approached Edgar Rice Burroughs with the idea of adapting &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; into a feature-length animated film. Burroughs responded enthusiastically, recognizing that a regular live-action feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately, so he advised Clampett to write an original animated adventure for John Carter. Working with Burroughs&#x27; son John Coleman Burroughs in 1935, Clampett used rotoscope and other hand-drawn techniques to capture the action, tracing the motions of an athlete who performed John Carter&#x27;s powerful movements in the reduced Martian gravity, and designed the green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks to give them a believable appearance. He then produced footage of them riding their eight-legged Thoats at a gallop, which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion; he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a Martian volcano. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was originally set to release the cartoons, and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series.

The test footage, produced by 1936, received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the U.S., especially in small towns; many gave their opinion that the concept of an Earthman on Mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern American audiences to accept. The series was not given the go-ahead, and Clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated &quot;Tarzan&quot; series, an offer that he later declined. Clampett recognized the irony in MGM&#x27;s decision, as the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; movie serial, released in the same year by Universal Studios, was highly successful. He speculated that MGM believed that serials were played only to children during Saturday matinees, whereas the John Carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening. The footage that Clampett produced was believed lost for many years, until Burroughs&#x27; grandson, Danton Burroughs, in the early 1970s found some of the film tests in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. archives. Had &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; been released, it might have preceded Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) to become the first American feature-length animated film.

===Disney progression===
During the late 1950s, stop-motion animation effects director Ray Harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels, but it was not until the 1980s that producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna bought the rights for the Walt Disney Studios via Cinergi Pictures, with a view to creating a competitor to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were hired to write, while John McTiernan and Tom Cruise were approached to direct and star. The project collapsed because McTiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate Burroughs&#x27; vision of Barsoom. The project remained at Disney, and Jeffrey Katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels, but the rights eventually returned to the Burroughs estate.

===Paramount effort===
Producer James Jacks read Harry Knowles&#x27; autobiography, which lavishly praised the &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; series. Having read the Burroughs&#x27; novels as a child, Jacks was moved to convince Paramount Pictures to acquire the film rights; a bidding war with Columbia Pictures followed. After Paramount and Jacks won the rights, Jacks contacted Knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired Mark Protosevich to write the screenplay. Robert Rodriguez signed on in 2004 to direct the film after his friend Knowles showed him the script. Recognizing that Knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers, Rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer.

Filming was set to begin in 2005, with Rodriguez planning to use the all-digital stages he was using for his production of &quot;Sin City&quot;, a film based on the graphic novel series by Frank Miller. Rodriguez planned to hire Frank Frazetta, the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film. Rodriguez had previously stirred-up film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit &quot;Sin City&quot;″s artist/creator Miller as co-director on the film adaptation; as a result, Rodriguez decided to resign from the Directors Guild of America. In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned Kerry Conran to direct and Ehren Kruger to rewrite the John Carter script. The Australian Outback was scouted as a shooting location. Conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in October 2005 by Jon Favreau.

Favreau and screenwriter Mark Fergus wanted to make their script faithful to Burroughs&#x27; novels, retaining John Carter&#x27;s links to the American Civil War and ensuring that the Barsoomian Tharks were tall (previous scripts had made them human-sized). Favreau argued that a modern-day soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like Carter, who had been a Confederate officer. The first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the Barsoom series: &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot;, and &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot;. Unlike Rodriguez and Conran, Favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) as his inspiration. He intended to use make-up, as well as CGI, to create the Tharks. In August 2006, Paramount chose not to renew the film rights, preferring instead to focus on its &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Favreau and Fergus moved on to Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Iron Man&quot;.

===Return to Disney, Stanton involvement===

Andrew Stanton, director of the Pixar Animation Studios hits &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot;, lobbied Walt Disney Studios to reacquire the rights from Burroughs&#x27; estate. &quot;Since I&#x27;d read the books as a kid, I wanted to see somebody put it on the screen,&quot; he explained.

Stanton then lobbied Disney heavily for the chance to direct the film, pitching it as &quot;Indiana Jones on Mars&quot;. The studio was initially skeptical. Stanton had never directed a live-action film before, and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience, at least on opening weekend. The screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow. However, since Stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make &quot;WALL-E&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; into hits, the studio approved him as director. Stanton noted he was effectively being &quot;loaned&quot; to Walt Disney Pictures because Pixar is an all-ages brand and &quot;John Carter&quot;, in his words, was &quot;not going to be an all-ages film&quot;.

By 2008, the first draft for Part One of a &quot;John Carter&quot; film trilogy was completed; the first film is based only on the first novel. In April 2009 author Michael Chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script. &quot;I&#x27;m really good at structure and collaborating,&quot; Stanton explained, &quot;but Michael is just technically, poetically, and intelligence-wise a better writer&quot;.

Following the completion of &quot;WALL-E&quot;, Stanton visited the archives of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., in Tarzana, California, as part of his research. Jim Morris, general manager of Pixar, said the film would have a unique look distinct from Frank Frazetta&#x27;s illustrations, which they both found dated. He also noted that although he had less time for pre-production than for any of his usual animated projects, the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read Burroughs&#x27; novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes. Stanton prepared for directing by losing , running a week, and vowed not to go to his trailer or even sit down except when absolutely necessary to avoid looking like &quot;the privileged animation geek who&#x27;d cheated his way to the top&quot;.

==Production==

===Casting===

Stanton said later he had no grand design for the cast, other than having the villains be played by British actors. &quot;I knew that the cast was going to grow with creatures and it was going to grow with different types of races if we were to continue. And it was going to get a little more fantastical&quot;, he said.

Many actors were considered for the title role. Aware that Carter&#x27;s backstory as an officer in the Confederate Army might be a problem for modern audiences, Stanton envisioned the character as disillusioned and disgusted with war in general, apart from the side he fought on. &quot;I wanted to not absolve him of that, but also not make him pro the side he was on. The best I could do was neutralize him&quot;. Taylor Kitsch quickly became his choice for the part, due to a scene in the &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; television series—his character, angry, is left behind by the bus—that captured Stanton&#x27;s vision for the character, as Kitsch&#x27;s pose echoed that of Carter on one cover of the books in Stanton&#x27;s collection.

Lynn Collins, a Juilliard graduate set in her first major movie role as Dejah Thoris early on, tested with many actors, including Josh Duhamel, using a scene (filmed but cut) where she slaps Carter in the face. &quot;Taylor and I have always had incredible chemistry. It was inevitable that we would get a chance to really explore it and work as a team,&quot; she said of her co-star in &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009). She recalls him coming into the dressing room after their test together and, seeing her smoking, told her she would have to quit if she got the part, which she did. At Disney&#x27;s insistence, she used a British accent.

Tom Cruise expressed interest in playing the role once production had begun; Collins did not read with him. &quot;I think him and Andrew had some conversations, but I don&#x27;t think he was ever actually in the mix so to speak&quot;, she recalled in 2022, noting that all the actors she read with were 20 years younger than him. Stanton said that as there was at that time the possibility of making two sequels, he kept that in mind. &quot;[I]t would take a while to make these three movies&quot;, he recalled. &quot;I&#x27;m like, &quot;How do I feel about how these people might age in the next five to seven years?&quot;&quot;

Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton played their roles as Tharks wearing motion capture suits while walking on stilts. Cameras attached to their outfits focused on their faces and captured their expressions, which were then used to create their characters&#x27; faces. &quot;It&#x27;s a game, it&#x27;s a new way of performing&quot;, he recalled, noting how physically demanding it was. &quot;Always as an actor you&#x27;re looking for things to jump off from, to find new ways of thinking, new ways of looking, to be turned on in a different way. The stilts were part of that&quot;.

Dafoe also had to do dialogue in Thark, developed for the film by Paul Frommer, who had developed the Na&#x27;vi language for &quot;Avatar&quot;. He had worked before with Stanton on &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, where he had come to like him. Dafoe found it pleasantly surprising that, given Stanton&#x27;s background in animation, he refused to rely on the effects. &quot;He really felt like he had to have the movie, so when we started these scenes, there was no &#x27;oh, the CGI will do that&#x27; or &#x27;they&#x27;ll do that in post,&quot; he said, which kept the film character-driven.

===Filming===

Principal photography began at Longcross Studios, England, in January 2010 and ended in Kanab, Utah, in July. Other locations in Utah included Lake Powell and Grand, Wayne, and Kane counties. Cinematographer Dan Mindel believed that the entire movie should have been shot in the Four Corners region of the southwestern U.S., the only place on Earth he felt could convincingly pass for Mars. &quot;A lot of the studio work that we had done was so compromised because of the choice of studio, the size of the stages, the fact that it was all inside when it should have been outside, all that kind of stuff&quot;.

Mindel had taken the job in order to learn how to make a movie with many effects shots. He worked with more restraint than he had been used to. Normally he kept the camera rolling even after the director said &quot;Cut!&quot;, a lesson he learned from Jackie Chan while making &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;. However, for &quot;John Carter&quot;, Stanton had planned the shots in such great detail before filming began as to leave little room for improvisation.

Stanton went for a different look for the movie&#x27;s costuming than that which had been planned by Rodriguez and Frazetta when they were attached to the project several years earlier. Stanton felt that Frazetta&#x27;s look was &quot;very sexist and it&#x27;s very male, fanboy dominated&quot;. While conceding the sex appeal at the heart of the characters, he believed they still had to seem realistic. &quot;I want anything, whether it&#x27;s a fish or a robot or a toy or a human being, I want them to be seen as dimensional as possible and be seen as somebody with thoughts and opinions and surprise in how they may react to something, and contradictions&quot;.

Throughout production there had been arguments from some of Stanton&#x27;s friends in Pixar&#x27;s Braintrust that it would be better for the movie to begin with Carter finding himself on Mars than through the narrative device of having Burroughs, supposedly his nephew, find his late uncle&#x27;s written account of his time there following his death and then flashing back to it. Stanton in response considered that &quot;lazy&quot;. He told them &quot;If I do that, then thirty minutes in I&#x27;m going to have to stop the film to explain the war, and Dejah, and who everyone is, and we&#x27;re going to have even bigger problems&quot;. They compromised by beginning the movie with the battle on Mars, and then the Zondangans getting the nanofoam gun from the Therns. That shift necessitated 18 new scenes, for which Disney agreed to a reshoot.

====Cinematography and visual effects====
The film was shot in the Panavision anamorphic format on Kodak 35 mm film stock. &quot;I try very hard to persuade whomever I&#x27;m working with to allow me to shoot on film, and to shoot anamorphically,&quot; Mindel told &quot;ICG&quot;, the magazine of the International Cinematographers Guild. &quot;It&#x27;s the most pure, high-definition way of capturing a scene, short of Showscan or IMAX&quot;.

But Mindel also liked the flaws in that process. Older Panavision lenses have imperfections and aberrations, and &quot;At a purely organic level, the light does unmanageable things when it hits an aberration&quot;, he said. &quot;An unquantifiable magic happens, and I love that!&quot; That unpredictability, and the effect on the film&#x27;s texture and grain, gave Mindel images he hoped would &quot;[feel] inherently realistic in spite of the fantastical creatures and the extensive digital-visual-effects technology behind them&quot;. For &quot;John Carter&quot; he used Panavision&#x27;s Primo and C-Series anamorphic lenses and ATZ and AWZ zoom lenses, with Kodak&#x27;s Vision3 500T Color Negative 5219 and 200T 5213 stock.

Shooting with a 3D release in mind was considered but dropped over a year before principal photography. The camera crew and effects specialists viewed Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, where space on the set was planned with the 3D release in mind. They realized that the processes used for that film would be outdated before they could expect that they would start &quot;John Carter&quot;, so there was no point in planning for 3D; Stanton also believed that would be too much to deal with while shooting in any event. Mindel said that was &quot;a huge relief&quot;.

Work on the visual effects had begun earlier, in 2009, before the release of &quot;Avatar&quot;, which revolutionized the field. The effects team doing proof-of-process tests realized when that movie came out that &quot;John Carter&quot; would require extensive use of all the techniques that &quot;Avatar&quot; had pioneered, and would go where that film had not with many more interactions between human actors and CGI characters. Peter Chiang, the film&#x27;s visual effects supervisor at Double Negative in London, wrote a production bible for the latter that described how each character should be composed and framed. Bruce McCleery, the second unit&#x27;s director of photography, said that bible was especially useful for scenes blending humans and CGI characters. &quot;Working that out was much more complex than it sounds&quot;.

Shooting the airship battle on a London soundstage required extensive preproduction work. Mindel and the lighting crew started work designing the lighting rig for that scene long before shooting started. They shared their work with the effects teams, which used Lidar to map it, as it did for every set. The sets housed the full airship models, mounted on gimbals with green screen on all sides. Ultimately, to stage an aerial battle with light-based weapons where the ships maneuver to block the sunlight that powers their opponents&#x27; craft, the lighting crew used 120 Spacelights, 15 Dino light banks, flashing lights and a crane mounted with soft lights and green screens that could fill in ambient light from the film&#x27;s sky.

Once production moved to the Utah desert, the weather added its own challenges. Heavy winds brought frequent sandstorms, forcing many on location to work while wearing goggles and sometimes burnooses. Mindel wanted the film to take advantage of these conditions as much as possible, although he had to tone it down slightly so the effects teams could do their job. &quot;All the uncontrollable natural phenomena did give the film a visceral, unpredictable quality, and contributed to its unique, idiosyncratic texture,&quot; McCleery said.

====Reshoots====

Before the formal reshoot, which took place throughout September in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Playa Vista, Stanton told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; he had done some smaller-scale reshooting focusing on additional dialogue for some characters in order to address the issues the preview had raised. In London, he shot scenes where West, as Sab Than, clarified the Therns&#x27; goals. Back in Los Angeles, Kitsch and Collins filmed Carter&#x27;s proposal scene. Then Stanton went back to London to film Strong&#x27;s side of the conversation with Sab Than. Stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time.

Stanton reshot much of the movie twice, far more than was common in live action filmmaking at that time. He attributed that to his animation background. &quot;The thing I had to explain to Disney was, &#x27;You&#x27;re asking a guy who&#x27;s only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot.&#x27;&quot; he explained later. &quot;I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not gonna get it right the first time, I&#x27;ll tell you that right now.&#x27;&quot; Stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at Pixar on animated films (known as the Braintrust) instead of those with live-action experience working with him.

Stanton also was quoted as saying, &quot;Is it just me, or do we actually know how to do this better than live-action crews do?&quot; Rich Ross, Disney&#x27;s chairman, successor to Dick Cook, who had originally approved the film for production, came from a television background and had no experience with feature films. The studio&#x27;s new top marketing and production executives had little more.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Tad Friend visited the set during the reshoot and wrote an article about it, noting that it was &quot;unusually extensive (and expensive)&quot;. Collins and Kitsch both made comments on the record about the reshoot that seemed defensive; Stanton told Friend not only that if it had been up to him he would have insisted on a second reshoot but that reshoots should be &quot;mandatory&quot;. It has subsequently been suggested that this article began the media narrative that &quot;John Carter&quot; was in serious trouble, as conventional Hollywood wisdom held that &quot;any&quot; reshoot was an indicator of a troubled production.

Collins believes that the reshoot was detrimental for her character. Originally filmed as a strong, independent warrior, the scenes added, such as those with her father, made her seem more vulnerable; and scenes like those in which she had slapped Carter were cut. She believes the studio wanted a softer take on Thoris and was reduced to asking Stanton every day what would work with that and just doing it.

After the reshoot, considerable work remained in post-production on Stanton&#x27;s first cut, reportedly almost three hours long. There were many effects and CGI shots to finish. Stanton recalls that &quot;[t]here were more animated shots in what was left to do on &quot;Carter&quot; than an entire animated feature&quot;. Animating the Tharks, especially in large numbers during battle scenes, proved particularly challenging; the software had to be upgraded for it, and as one animator recalls, work scenes sometimes took three hours to open. Many of those working on the CGI were particularly appreciative of Stanton, since due to his background he had considerable expertise in the area and made himself more available than directors of such films usually are.

==Marketing==

&quot;John Carter&quot;″s marketing has been called &quot;one of the worst marketing campaigns in movie history&quot;. The filmmakers believe that the decisions made in marketing the film were the primary reason for its failure. A new studio executive team with minimal experience in that side of the business was in charge, and not as emotionally invested in its success as the filmmakers had been. Furthermore, unbeknownst to them, Disney CEO Robert Iger had already begun talks with George Lucas about buying Lucasfilm and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, eliminating any incentive the company had to launch a successful competing film franchise.

The head of Walt Disney Studios Marketing during the production was M T Carney, an industry outsider who previously ran a boutique marketing firm in New York with no previous experience marketing movies. Stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio, according to those who worked on the film. His ideas were used instead, and he ignored criticism that using a cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Kashmir&quot; in the trailer released in conjunction with an ad aired during that year&#x27;s Super Bowl would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought.

He also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences, and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience. Stanton said, &quot;My joy when I saw the first trailer for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is I saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie, and I had no idea how it connected, and I had to go see the movie. So the last thing I&#x27;m going to do is ruin that little kid&#x27;s experience&quot;. Following the death of Steve Jobs, Stanton dedicated the film in his memory.

===Effect of other 2011 films&#x27; box office===

Disney reportedly grew more concerned about the film&#x27;s prospects after the 2011 failure of the Lionsgate Films&#x27; remake of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Like &quot;John Carter&quot;, it was based on a popular fantasy franchise that had during the 1980s been adapted into successful films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lionsgate&#x27;s version had cost $90 million and starred Jason Momoa. Chabon recalls reading a Quora post by one of its screenwriters, Sean Hood, about how he dealt with the movie&#x27;s failure, and for the first time worrying about the possibility that &quot;John Carter&quot; could suffer the same fate.

&quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;, released in July, also had an effect on &quot;John Carter&quot;. It too had science fiction and western elements, and did not fare well commercially. That was taken as indicating that contemporary audiences were not interested in westerns, or any film set in the American past, so those elements would be downplayed in the trailers and other marketing for &quot;John Carter&quot;.

One of Disney&#x27;s own recent big-budget franchise films was also adding to executives&#x27; anxieties about &quot;John Carter&quot;. The May 2011 release of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; had done well at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film domestically that year and making over a billion dollars worldwide. However, the film&#x27;s budget, exceeding $400 million by some estimates, made it the most expensive film ever produced. Its profits were thus lower than a film that popular might have been expected to generate, making Disney fear the same could happen with &quot;John Carter&quot;. By the time of the reshoot four months after &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;, it was reported that &quot;John Carter&quot; would have to make at least $700 million worldwide, more than twice its escalating production costs, to justify a sequel.

===July 2011 preview screening===

Initially expectations of the film&#x27;s commercial success were high. The studio held a sneak preview in mid-2011, before the reshoot, in Portland, Oregon. Stanton, who had been diagnosed with high-functioning attention deficit hyperactivity disorder early in the process of writing the script, was so nervous he took lorazepam not just on the flight there but before the preview. Four Disney executives were in attendance to watch the reactions of 400 filmgoers and read their opinions afterwards. The audience reactions seemed to indicate that audiences were engaged with the film and laughed when they were supposed to, which relaxed Stanton.

Afterwards, many of them rated the film as &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;, for an average audience approval rating of 75 percent, which pleased the studio. Carney said that that number could probably be rounded up to 80, reflecting work that had yet to be done. According to the preview cards, that work would also include improving the pacing of the film&#x27;s second act, making the motivations of the Therns clearer, and developing the relationship between Carter and Thoris so that their wedding at the end was not so much of a surprise.

===Title changes===

The film&#x27;s title was a major issue; there are several accounts of who decided to change it and why. It is largely based on the first book of the series, &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, but was originally titled &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;. Stanton changed the title to that from the book&#x27;s title early in 2011, &quot;because not a single boy would go&quot;. Later he removed &quot;of Mars&quot; to make it more appealing to a broader audience, calling the film an &quot;origin story ... about a guy &quot;becoming&quot; John Carter of Mars&quot;. Disney also reportedly believed that the sex appeal of the popular Kitsch being shirtless throughout the movie would draw women to see the film. Since women are believed by Hollywood to be averse to science fiction, in this account, &quot;Mars&quot; was excised from the title.

Stanton planned to keep &quot;Mars&quot; in the title for the proposed future films in the series. Kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the character&#x27;s journey, as John Carter would become &quot;of Mars&quot; only in the film&#x27;s last few minutes. Former Disney marketing president Carney has also been blamed for suggesting the title change.

Another reported explanation for the name change was that Disney had suffered a significant loss in March 2011 with &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;; Carney reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word &quot;Mars&quot; in the title had not been commercially successful. Chabon responds that all those films were poorly regarded by critics.

Despite the name change, some hints of the original title remain. Some promotional materials used the stylized &quot;JCM&quot; logo, and at the end of the film is a title card with &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;. The marketing team had yielded to Stanton on that, and he explained that &quot;it means something by the end of the movie, and if there are more movies I want that to be what you remember&quot;.

After the film&#x27;s release and subsequent failure, the truncated title was seen as part of the problem. &quot;What the hell is John Carter? What&#x27;s the film about?&quot; asked Peter Sealey, former marketing president at Columbia, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot; I don&#x27;t know who John Carter is. You&#x27;ve got to make that clear&quot;. Stanton reportedly believed there was enough awareness of the books that this would not be a problem, to which another marketing executive responded, &quot;People don&#x27;t say, &#x27;I know what I&#x27;ll be for Halloween! I&#x27;ll be John Carter!&#x27;&quot;

===Trailers===

The film&#x27;s teaser trailer released in August 2011 was also seen as poor marketing. It relied largely on visual imagery from the film, without saying much about the creators and their previous accomplishments, or Burroughs&#x27;s work and how it had influenced later science fiction universes like &quot;Star Wars&quot;. There were few effects and little action; Stanton has denied a rumor that that was because he did not have enough finished effects shots to use. Disney executives have faulted Stanton for this, since his success at Pixar allowed him to demand and get control over &quot;John Carter&quot;″s trailers.

They reportedly strongly implored him to listen to their suggestions and he refused. &quot;This is one of the worst marketing campaigns in the history of movies,&quot; a former studio marketing chief complained to &quot;Vulture&quot; shortly before the film opened. &quot;It&#x27;s almost as if they went out of their way to &quot;not&quot; make us care&quot;. After the full trailer, and the Super Bowl ad derived from it seemed similarly bland, enough for Kitsch to publicly concur with criticisms of the film&#x27;s marketing campaign, a fan group online put out a competing trailer meant to address the official one&#x27;s deficiencies. During February 2012, new television ads emphasizing story points were launched, and a similarly cut trailer was attached to &quot;Act of Valor&quot;.

===Early 2012===

After several weeks away from her office, Carney left at the beginning of 2012, with four years remaining on her contract, to be replaced by Ricky Strauss, former president of Participant Media, for the beginning of the period immediately preceding the film&#x27;s release when promotional efforts become more intensive. He committed to spending over $100 million to that end. Sealey called the change in marketing leadership &quot;[t]he worst thing that can happen to a movie&quot; as it adversely affects the morale of the cast and crew, who often have to promote the film personally in the media.

Disney moved the film&#x27;s release up to early March 2012 from June, giving it two box office weekends before Lionsgate&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, widely expected to do very well and compete for the same audience, came out. As that date approached, the usual aspects of Disney&#x27;s marketing pushes for big-budget tentpole films were absent. There were no large merchandise displays in the company&#x27;s online and retail stores, nor at big-box stores like Target. Nor were there prominently placed ads in the company&#x27;s theme parks, or coverage on Disney-owned media such as the ABC broadcast network or Disney Channel. &quot;It needs to feel like an event, and right now it doesn&#x27;t feel like an event,&quot; an unnamed marketing expert told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

Instead, the company tried some alternative marketing approaches. Stanton gave a TED talk on storytelling, that had a short scene from &quot;John Carter&quot; as an example of one of his points. While that was seen as effective, some other promotions, such as an &quot;Are You The Real John Carter?&quot; contest, in which men who could prove that was their real name were encouraged to enter a contest where winners would be invited to a special fan screening, were not.

As the premiere date neared, some of the filmmakers were unaware of the negative press coverage already attached to the movie. Mindel and Stanton admitted later that they were somewhat oblivious due to largely being in contact only with those whom they had been working with in post-production. Collins said those who worked for her and followed media coverage kept that information from her.

Dafoe, on the other hand, was aware that the media were lowering the public and the industry&#x27;s expectations for the film: &quot;[M]y recollection was that even before it was released, there were grumblings about it ... everything from the name change to regime change to poor publicity. But I remember before the movie was even seen, people were counting it out&quot;.

====Poor tracking====

Tracking data, the results of long-term surveys of likely filmgoers to judge their interest in seeing an upcoming film upon its release, with a prediction of its opening weekend box office, for &quot;John Carter&quot; was returned to Disney in mid-February and shared both within and without the company. Nikki Finke reported in &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; that the numbers pointed to a serious failure. Barely half the likely audience was aware of the film, 27 percent said they were interested in seeing it, and 3 percent said it would be their first choice that weekend.

An executive at a rival studio told Finke that demographic data with the &quot;shocking&quot; tracking for such a costly film showed that women in particular &quot;have flat out rejected the film&quot; and expected &quot;the biggest writeoff of all time&quot;. Finke reported that she had heard estimates of a loss around $100 million, but allowed that soft numbers had been widely expected as Disney&#x27;s in-house surveys had been showing them for some time. Disney told her that the Super Bowl ad had given the film an expected &quot;pop of awareness&quot; and the studio remained committed to a full marketing push before the release.

Chabon says that on the eve of the premiere, he was in a hotel down the street and Disney&#x27;s marketing department was showing the team the latest tracking. &quot;None of it was good&quot;, he recalled. Despite doubts and awareness of previous occasions when such dire forecasts had been wide of the mark, &quot;[w]e just all kind of knew at that point it was going to be bad. It was not going to go well&quot;.

Just before the film was released, an Evercore analyst who followed Disney more than doubled his estimate of the likely loss, to $165 million, because of the tracking. Other analysts had similarly revised their estimates upward, to $100 million or more.

===Premiere===

Disney scheduled the late February premiere for Regal&#x27;s LA Live Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, rather than the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, which it owned and had renovated extensively. The choice of venue has been described as &quot;odd&quot;, since Disney had held most of its premieres, particularly of big-budget franchise films, there since the renovation. In a news release announcing the premiere, Disney highlighted that the movie would be shown in 3D on a screen to an audience of 800 in three theaters, ranging from the cast and crew and company executives to critics, D23 members and winners of contests.

Collins, still unaware of the negative media perception of the film, recalls walking in and going down the red carpet behind Kitsch. She saw Rich Ross call him over and whisper something in his ear, after which he suddenly stepped back. When she caught up to Kitsch, she asked what Ross had told him that had so affected him. &quot; &#x27;It&#x27;s a disaster.&#x27; He just told me, &#x27;It&#x27;s going to be a fucking disaster.&#x27;&quot;

===Post-release criticisms===

In the &quot;LA Times&quot; the week after the release, industry insiders suggested two reasons the film might have struggled to succeed with audiences regardless of how well it had been made or marketed. One was that more recent franchises, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, that had derived and borrowed from Burroughs&#x27; original concepts in the century since it had been written had exhausted the potential for audiences to be enthralled by any modern adaptation of his work. Jacks, the producer who had tried to make a film of the work in the early 2000s, recalled having given director Robert Zemeckis the novels in order to interest him in the project. &quot;I don&#x27;t think so,&quot; Zemeckis told him after reading them. &quot;George [Lucas] has really plundered these books&quot;.

Another industry marketing person, speaking anonymously, told the &quot;Times&quot; that modern audiences have a &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; problem with films set on Mars based on older works. At the time Burroughs wrote, little was known about conditions on Mars, allowing an author to fill in those gaps with invented details. However, modern audiences know from the many actual uncrewed missions to Mars that that planet is uninhabitable and apparently devoid of life. &quot;You&#x27;re not able to sell [Burroughs&#x27;s vision]&quot;, he said.

Two of the film&#x27;s supporting cast members weighed in later in the year on the role marketing played in its poor box office performance in separate interviews with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;. In July, Cranston called its cool reception &quot;unwarranted&quot; and blamed it on TV stations around the country focusing on commercial news about how &quot;John Carter&quot; had underperformed and not even won its opening weekend rather than offering a review of the film, leading viewers to make their decisions about what movie to see on that basis. &quot;Why is it all of a sudden important for average Americans to know how much money a movie made at the box office?&quot;

&quot;I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s done so badly, or that it&#x27;s perceived as being the [biggest] flop in Hollywood history&quot;, West said four months later. &quot;It&#x27;s not that bad at all&quot;. He defended Stanton and the film, calling the former &quot;a fucking &quot;genius&quot;&quot; and noting that the reviews actually had not been very bad. West disclosed also that after production, in 2010, he had seen a marketing plan for the film that was never used, which he believed would have been much more effective than what Disney chose to do.

In 2020 &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Kayleigh Donaldson reiterated the earlier arguments that Stanton&#x27;s Pixar-based filmmaking process had unnecessarily increased costs, and that the film&#x27;s ensuing bloated production budget made it harder to be profitable, as had been the case with &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;. She noted that all but one of the 10 most expensive films ever made had been made in the last decade, and all but one of those nine had been Disney productions. &quot;This is now the status quo for blockbuster cinema, an era of too-big-to-fail filmmaking that is almost exclusively reliant on international grosses just to break even&quot;. Of those eight Disney films, &quot;John Carter&quot; was the only one not part of an existing franchise. That large budget was necessary to faithfully and credibly replicate Burroughs&#x27;s vision onscreen, but at the same time audiences were accustomed enough to expensive CGI and effects spectacles that that alone could not be expected to impress them.

Donaldson also criticized the titling, noting that the early decision to not use the book title, &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, &quot;raised a lot of questions over who Disney wanted to sell the movie to&quot;, implying that the studio feared that men might not be interested in a movie with &quot;Princess&quot; in the title, despite Disney&#x27;s own experience to the contrary with its many princess movies. Stripping it down to just &quot;John Carter&quot; &quot;robbed the movie of its identity ... as a title [it] conveyed nothing to potential audiences about the movie they were being sold&quot;. Henry Hards, a writer at &quot;Giant Freakin Robot&quot;, agreed in 2023, calling &quot;John Carter&quot; &quot;the most generic title possible ... Don&#x27;t tell me that [&quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;] wouldn&#x27;t have looked a lot better on a movie poster&quot;.

Stanton&#x27;s stated reason for the latter move, that the narrative is about how John Carter becomes John Carter of Mars, also, to Donaldson, points to another problem that has beset other films adapted from series with multiple books. &quot;In an effort to play catch-up to a franchise that spent years developing its intricately woven multiple narratives, many studios tried to do the work of three or four movies in one&quot;, she wrote. &quot;This resulted in a lot of franchise non-starters because audiences had little interest in films that existed solely to set up a bunch of sequels for a property they didn&#x27;t care about&quot;. Among these she included &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, and &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;. Likewise with &quot;John Carter&quot;, the realization of Barsoom onscreen &quot;wasn&#x27;t enough to sustain a movie and didn&#x27;t entice enough people to invest in a trilogy that would never see the light of day&quot;.

Donaldson argued that in addition to being overtaken by works influenced by it, the Carter franchise was no longer popular enough to sustain an expensive film franchise by 2012, a century after the first book was published, an issue unintentionally highlighted by the use of &quot;Kashmir&quot; in the trailer. There still were fans, she conceded, but &quot;[n]ame recognition alone does not make a movie hit. Just ask the most recent &quot;Tarzan&quot; reboot for evidence of that, or Disney&#x27;s own attempt to make &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; a 21st century action favorite&quot;, referring to the studio&#x27;s 2013 effort, which also failed at the box office.

Hards also said his complaints about the title led to another area where the marketing failed the film: its posters. &quot;They work, but they also highlight the biggest problem the movie has. They all scream family-friendly&quot;. Burroughs&#x27;s books, by contrast, depict &quot;a violent barbarian warrior-style ... world in which women don&#x27;t wear clothes&quot;, or at least that was how they had been depicted on older covers of the books, pointing to one on which Dejah is shown in a very scanty bikini. &quot;Martian women are strong, confident, and have no body shame. They don&#x27;t need clothes. Or at least that&#x27;s the premise Burroughs presents as the reality of life on Mars&quot;. The franchise was &quot;an R-rated, &quot;Conan&quot;-style story set in space&quot; and should have been filmed that way, although Hards allowed that might alienate early 20th-century, even though it might have seemed liberating when Burroughs wrote the books.

==Music and soundtrack==

In February 2010, Michael Giacchino revealed in an interview he would be scoring the film. A year and a half later, in his &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, Friend documents accompanying Stanton on a visit to Giacchino where they discuss the movie&#x27;s score and how it relates to the narrative. Stanton had put in the scratch music, the temporary music used to show what mood he wanted the actual score to reflect, himself rather than delegating that task to an editor as is commonly done. He told the composer that he wanted the music to reflect the two distinct plans driving the plot: Carter&#x27;s and the Therns&#x27;. Stanton also said he wanted the music for Carter to change in a way that reflected his slow acceptance of himself as John Carter of Mars.

Stanton had used music from &quot;&quot; for the Therns; he wanted something similarly choral. With the opening voiceover and battle footage, he had put music from &quot;Syriana&quot; that sounded &quot;dire and Middle Eastern and forlorn, like a culture clinging to its nobility&quot;. He suggested something similar to Giacchino as the &quot;Mars theme&quot;, but advised against eventually merging it with Carter&#x27;s theme. &quot;[J]ust because you&#x27;re master of the high seas doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have a separate theme for the ocean&quot;. Giacchino agreed but suggested a different merger, doing the Mars theme chorally near the end of the film, to accentuate the Therns&#x27; apparently inevitable takeover of the planet, an idea Stanton eagerly accepted. Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on March 6, 2012, three days before the film&#x27;s release.

==Release==
===Theatrical run===
&quot;John Carter&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The original film release date was June 8, 2012. In January 2011, Disney moved the release date up three months to March 9 of that year. A teaser trailer for the film premiered on July 14 and was shown in 3D and 2D with showings of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;; the official trailer premiered on November 30. On February 5, 2012, an extended commercial promoting the movie aired during the Super Bowl, and the day before the game, Stanton, a Massachusetts native, held a special screening of the film for both the team members and families of the New England Patriots and New York Giants, the competing teams.

===Home media===
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;John Carter&quot; on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on June 5, 2012. The home media release was made available in three different physical packages: a four-disc combo pack (1 disc Blu-ray 3D, 1-disc Blu-ray, 1 DVD, and 1-disc digital copy), a two-disc combo pack (1 disc Blu-ray, 1 disc DVD), and one-disc DVD. &quot;John Carter&quot; was also made available in 3D High Definition, High Definition, and Standard Definition Digital. Additionally, the home media edition was available in an On-Demand format. The Blu-ray bonus features include Disney Second Screen functionality, &quot;360 Degrees of John Carter&quot;, deleted scenes, and &quot;Barsoom Bloopers&quot;. The DVD bonus features included &quot;100 Years in the Making&quot;, and audio commentary with filmmakers. The High Definition Digital and Standard Definition Digital versions both include Disney Second Screen, &quot;Barsoom Bloopers&quot;, and deleted scenes. The Digital 3D High Definition Digital copy does not include bonus features. In mid-June, the movie topped sales on both the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert sales chart, which tracks overall disc sales, and Nielsen&#x27;s dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart, with the DVD release selling almost a million copies making $17 million and Blu-ray and 3-D releases selling almost as many copies making $19.2 million, for a combined total of $36.3 million in its first week alone.

==Reception==
===Box office===

Although the film grossed nearly $300 million worldwide, it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost. At the time of its release, Disney claimed the film&#x27;s production budget was $250 million, although tax returns released in 2014 revealed its exact budget was $263.7 million after taking tax credits into account. Before the film opened, analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant cost combined with production and marketing costs of $350 million, with Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com, noting &quot;&quot;John Carter&quot;&#x27;s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than $600 million to break even ... a height reached by only 63 films in the history of moviemaking&quot;. Within two weeks of its release, Disney took a $200 million writedown on the film, ranking it among the biggest box-office bombs of all time. Two months after the release, the Walt Disney Company released a statement on its earnings attributing the $161 million decline in the operating income of its Studio Entertainment division to a loss of $84 million in the quarter ending March 2012 &quot;primarily&quot; due to the performance of &quot;John Carter&quot; and the associated cost write-down.

====Domestic====

On March 9, 2012, &quot;John Carter&quot; opened domestically in over 3,500 theaters, taking in almost $10 million, the highest grosses of any film released that day. It was the only time period for which that would be true. The following day, &quot;The Lorax&quot;, the previous weekend&#x27;s box office winner, which had lost that night to &quot;John Carter&quot; only by around $300,000, reasserted its primacy, grossing $18 million even as Disney&#x27;s film improved to $12.3 million. &quot;The Lorax&quot; went on to win the weekend, with $38.8 million to &quot;John Carter&quot;″s $30.1 million, which still made it the highest-grossing new release that weekend, easily beating &quot;Silent House&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Words&quot;.

Domestically, both &quot;The Lorax&quot; and &quot;John Carter&quot; were displaced by the next weekend&#x27;s winner, the newly released &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, which easily outgrossed both. &quot;John Carter&quot; stayed in all its theaters, but revenues dropped by more than half from the previous weekend, to $13 million. On the film&#x27;s third weekend, its theater count dropped by approximately 500 as &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; arrived in theaters with a $152.5 million opening weekend; &quot;John Carter&quot;″s receipts again more than halved, down to $5 million.

Throughout April, grosses and theaters continued to decline. Following that year&#x27;s Easter weekend, it dropped out of the box office top 10, by which point it was in less than 500 theaters and earning less than a million dollars. &quot;John Carter&quot; experienced a slight resurgence on the first weekend of May, coinciding with the release of Disney&#x27;s other expected tentpole for early 2012, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, a Marvel film based on its popular comic franchise, when its theater count nearly doubled and grosses rose to $1.5 million, the last weekend they would reach seven figures. Disney again increased its theater count two weeks later, when &quot;Battleship&quot;, also starring Kitsch, was released. But it did not boost the grosses, which steadily declined as it left more and more theaters through the end of June.

====International====

Outside North America, it topped the weekend chart, opening with $70.6 million. Its highest-grossing opening was in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), where it broke the all-time opening-day record ($6.5 million) and earned $16.5 million during the weekend. The film also scored the second-best opening weekend for a Disney film in China ($14.0 million). It was in first place at the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends.

&quot;John Carter&quot; grossed $73.1 million in North America and $211.1 million in other countries, for a worldwide total , of $284.1 million. It had a worldwide opening of $100.8 million. Its highest-grossing areas after North America are China ($41.5 million), Russia and the CIS ($33.4 million), and Mexico ($12.1 million).

===Critical response===
One week before the film&#x27;s release, Disney removed an embargo on reviews of the film. The film holds a 52% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 239 reviews, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The consensus reads: &quot;While &quot;John Carter&quot; looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills, it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization&quot;. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics&#x27; reviews, the film holds a score of 51 based on 43 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Derivative but charming and fun enough, Disney&#x27;s mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy&quot;. Glenn Kenny of MSN Movies rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, &quot;By the end of the adventure, even the initially befuddling double-frame story pays off, in spades. For me, this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that I&#x27;d willingly sit through a second or even third time&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, commenting that the movie &quot;is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed. Does &quot;John Carter&quot; get the job done for the weekend action audience? Yes, I suppose it does&quot;. Dan Jolin of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 5, noting, &quot;Stanton has built a fantastic world, but the action is unmemorable. Still, just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere&quot;. Joe Neumaier of the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, calling the film &quot;undeniably silly, sprawling and easy to make fun of, [but] also playful, genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is. In this genre, those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold&quot;.

Conversely, Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a negative review, saying, &quot;To watch &quot;John Carter&quot; is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe Stanton brought to &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot;&quot;. Owen Glieberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a D rating, feeling, &quot;Nothing in &quot;John Carter&quot; really works, since everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better&quot;. Christy Lemire of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that, &quot;Except for a strong cast, a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor, &quot;John Carter&quot; is just a dreary, convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computer-generated blippery converted to 3-D&quot;. Michael Philips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying the film &quot;isn&#x27;t much – or rather, it&#x27;s too much and not enough in weird, clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur&quot;. Andrew O&#x27;Herir of Salon.com called it &quot;a profoundly flawed film, and arguably a terrible one on various levels. But if you&#x27;re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence, it&#x27;s also a rip-roaring, fun adventure, fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second&quot;. Mick LaSalle of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; rated the film 1 star out of 4, noting, &quot;&quot;John Carter&quot; is a movie designed to be long, epic and in 3-D, but that&#x27;s as far as the design goes. It&#x27;s designed to be a product, and it&#x27;s a flimsy one&quot;.
A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;&quot;John Carter&quot; tries to evoke, to reanimate, a fondly recalled universe of B-movies, pulp novels and boys&#x27; adventure magazines. But it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic, which buries the easy, scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess. A bad movie should not look this good&quot;.

In the UK, the film was panned by Peter Bradshaw in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, gaining only 1 star out of 5 and described as a &quot;giant, suffocating doughy feast of boredom&quot;. The film garnered 2 out of 5 stars in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, described as &quot;a technical marvel, but is also armrest-clawingly hammy and painfully dated&quot;. BBC film critic Mark Kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting, &quot;The story telling is incomprehensible, the characterisation is ludicrous, the story is two and a quarter hours long and it&#x27;s a boring, boring, boring two and a quarter hours long&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Aftermath==

===Corporate===

The film&#x27;s failure led to the resignation of Rich Ross, the head of Walt Disney Studios, even though Ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the Disney Channel with &quot;John Carter&quot; already in development. Ross theoretically could have stopped production on &quot;John Carter&quot; as he did with a planned remake of &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, or minimized the budget as he did to &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; starring Johnny Depp. Instead, Stanton was given the production budget requested for &quot;John Carter&quot;, backed with an estimated $100 million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tie-ins. It was reported that Ross later sought to blame Pixar for &quot;John Carter&quot;, which prompted key Pixar executives to turn against Ross, who already had alienated many within the studio.

In September 2014, studio president Alan Bergman was asked at a conference if Disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;John Carter&quot; through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods, and he responded: &quot;I&#x27;m going to answer that question honestly and tell you no, it didn&#x27;t get that much better. We did lose that much money on those movies&quot;.

Double Negative, the British visual effects house now known as DNEG, also saw its business adversely affected by the film&#x27;s failure. According to its later head, Robyn Luckham, who worked extensively on &quot;John Carter&quot;, the goal of working on the film was to develop expertise in animating creatures, something they believed would be in demand in the near future. &quot;[E]veryone got cold feet&quot;, he recalls. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have another big show like that for a long time. It was tough&quot;.

===Personal===

The night after the premiere, Lynn Collins says she was at another event to promote the movie, when her manager at the time told her &quot;you&#x27;re just going to have to disappear for a while&quot; due to the mounting perception of the film&#x27;s failure. She felt it was sexist that as the film&#x27;s female lead she should suffer for its failure while Kitsch went on to make &quot;Battleship&quot;, another big-budget science fiction film that failed at the box office when it was released two months after &quot;John Carter&quot;. &quot;I took a break and tried to figure out, up until then my career and my work, I really allowed it to define me&quot;, she later said. A year later she fired not just her manager but her entire representation.

After the premiere, Stanton went back to New York City, where as he later told the &quot;LA Times&quot; he spent the next three weeks riding the subway, working on other scripts and reconnecting with his daughter and friends. &quot;I had to go into true &#x27;Lost Weekend&#x27; to just purge myself&quot; of empty nest syndrome, he said later. He returned to Pixar, where his many longtime coworkers felt badly for him; Iger had called him shortly after the premiere, quoting from Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Citizenship in a Republic&quot; speech. &quot;It was the best thing anybody could say at that moment and especially him&quot;, Stanton recalled. &quot;It just made me all the more loyal to him after that, whatever they needed help with&quot;.

==Cancelled sequels==
Prior to the film&#x27;s release, the filmmakers reported that &quot;John Carter&quot; was intended to be the first film of a trilogy. Producers Jim Morris and Lindsey Collins began work on a sequel based on Burroughs&#x27; second novel, &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot;. However, the film&#x27;s poor box office performance put plans for sequels into question.

In June 2012 co-writer Mark Andrews said in an interview that he, Stanton, and Chabon were still interested in doing sequels: &quot;As soon as somebody from Disney says, &#x27;We want &quot;John Carter 2&quot;″, we&#x27;d be right there&quot;. Despite criticism and Disney&#x27;s financial disappointment with the film, lead actors Taylor Kitsch and Willem Dafoe all showed strong support, with Kitsch stating &quot;I would do &quot;John Carter&quot; again tomorrow. I&#x27;m very proud of &quot;John Carter&quot;&quot;.

In September 2012, Stanton announced that his next directorial effort would be Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, and that the plan to film a &quot;John Carter&quot; sequel had been cancelled. Kitsch later stated he would not make another &quot;John Carter&quot; film unless Stanton returns as director. In a May 2014 interview, he added, &quot;I still talk to Lynn Collins almost daily. Those relationships that were born won&#x27;t be broken by people we never met. I miss the family. I miss Andrew Stanton. I know the second script was awesome. We had to plant a grounding, so we could really take off in the second one. The second one was even more emotionally taxing, which was awesome&quot;. Stanton tweeted both titles and logos for the sequels that would have been made with the titles being &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;.

In October 2014, Disney allowed the film rights to the &quot;Barsoom&quot; novels to revert to the Burroughs estate. In November 2016, Stanton stated, &quot;I will always mourn the fact that I didn&#x27;t get to make the other two films I planned for that series&quot;.

===Stanton&#x27;s &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; setup===

In 2022, on the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Stanton shared with &quot;TheWrap&quot; how the sequel, &quot;Gods of Mars&quot;, would have begun ... with Collins reading the prologue narration as Dejah and, over a relevant montage, recounting the events of the first film. When she appeared diegetically, she would be shown telling it to an infant, Carthoris, her child by Carter. Tardos would then have come into the scene, telling Dejah to go to bed herself and he would put his grandchild to bed. When she left, Tardos would have been revealed to actually be Matai Shang, having shapeshifted to appear to be Tardos, and then after Shang kidnapping the child the opening credits would have begun.

Following the credits, Stanton said, Carter would be seen in his funeral suit lying in the middle of the desert, and waking up. He would take off his jacket and start walking, as a thoat driven by a Thark slowly came in from the horizon. The driver would tell Carter he knew who he was and someone was looking for him. He would take Carter to Kantos Kan, who had been searching for Carter for a long time and was shocked to actually find him. Kan would explain to Carter &quot;you have to get back to heal him&quot;.

The audience, expecting a reunion, would then learn that some time had elapsed since the prologue. In the interim, Dejah would have disappeared as well, exploring the River Iss in hopes of finding Carter. Eventually it would have been revealed that the Therns took their child, which would have, as in the second of Burroughs&#x27; books and &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, led to revelations that a technologically advanced race living beneath the surface was controlling the air and water supply to keep the planet alive. He implied he had written more, but that was as much as he was willing to reveal at that time.

==Legacy==

The film&#x27;s two leads remain proud of the work they did and believe the film is better than its reputation. Kitsch, who has largely returned to television work following his two big-budget failures in 2012, told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; when &quot;21 Bridges&quot; was released in 2019 that &quot;I learned a ton on that movie. I honestly don&#x27;t see it as a failure&quot;. He noted that fans in Europe still stopped him on the street and mentioned the movie, which he believed had also seen an uptick in viewership due to its recent availability on Netflix.

Collins says it took some time for her to come to terms with the film and its effect on her career. Eventually, &quot;[p]eople started reaching out to me and expressing to me how much the movie changed their life, how much the character inspired them and motivated them ... It&#x27;s posterity forever. I will die, and people will still be seeing this movie&quot;. She came to realize that &quot;a movie that is that polarizing is good no matter what, because that&#x27;s what art is supposed to do&quot;.

On the 10th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Richard Newby considered its longterm impact, observing that it &quot;changed the film landscape, just not in the way anyone intended it to ... [It] was the moment Disney became the servant of sure bets, and Hollywood realized star power was truly gone. That was when we entered the age of name recognition, where familiar characters and concepts—Jedi, superheroes—became worth more than any actor&#x27;s name&quot;.

===Decennial reassessment===
Newby also argued that the film was better than its reputation. &quot;What makes the box office failure so frustrating is that I don&#x27;t believe this to be a case where anything could have been done differently&quot;, he wrote. &quot;With the filmmaker, cast and technology at hand, &quot;John Carter&quot; was the best adaptation of &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; that could have been made and seems will ever be made&quot;. He believed the film had actually improved on the book, giving its characters more depth and complexity.

In a lengthy history of the film and an analysis of what contributed to its perceived failure on its 10th anniversary, &quot;TheWrap&quot;″s Drew Taylor noted that for all the other discussions of what went wrong with &quot;John Carter&quot;,

Three months later, &quot;/Film&quot;″s Sandy Schaefer, after admitting that the film was &quot;not without its faults&quot;, found &quot;John Carter&quot; was visually accomplished, &quot;combin[ing] the gravelly textures of a Western with the striking aesthetic of a pulp sci-fi epic&quot;. Stanton had made better use of the film&#x27;s budget than other directors of more recent tentpole films. Ironically, Schaefer concluded, &quot;[a]fter a decade of superhero movies and &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, &quot;John Carter&quot;—itself adapted from source material that directly inspired so many of those things—comes across as more refreshing and less derivative now than when it was first released&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;/Film anniversary story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the passage of time had not helped the film for &quot;Gizmodo&quot;″s Germain Lussier, who wrote, &quot;I remember not hating the movie, but not particularly liking it either, and in the decade since release I&#x27;ve always wondered if &quot;John Carter&quot; had cult potential&quot;. Upon watching it again, he concluded it did not. &quot;Ten years hasn&#x27;t changed &quot;John Carter&quot; at all. It&#x27;s still not an awful movie. There are a few really excellent things in there. But it&#x27;s mostly just drawn out, uninteresting, and boring, in large part [due] to the whole thing feeling so derivative&quot;, since by 2012 aspects of the story that had been original to Burroughs&#x27;s work had been reused in so many other works.

Lussier also felt the &quot;oceans of exposition between warring factions that are barely distinguishable&quot; came at the expense of the movie&#x27;s more successful action sequences, and apart from Dafoe and Morton he felt most of the Thark characters had little depth. &quot;&quot;John Carter&quot; works, but it doesn&#x27;t work well,&quot; Lussier concluded. &quot;[T]his viewing made me realize that I doubt even 50 years will change how it feels&quot;.

<text>The island nation of Kiribati first participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics. It has competed at every Summer Games since then but has not yet entered the Winter Olympics.

After participating in the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 1998, Kiribati started working towards membership of the International Olympic Committee. During a meeting of the IOC in Prague in 2003, Kiribati was accepted into the organization and was set to participate in the 2004 Summer games. The country&#x27;s name was notably mispronounced by officials in all three languages—French, English and Greek—during the opening ceremony. Its delegation consisted of weightlifter Meamea Thomas and sprinters Kakianako Nariki (Kiribati&#x27;s first Olympic competitor) and Kaitinano Mwemweata.

== History ==

Kiribati wanted to join the Olympics in the 1980s. Their National Olympic Committee was created in 2002, and approved by the IOC in 2003.

== Facilities and training ==

When the athletes train on their own, they typically run barefoot. The 80-90 I-Kiribati athletes have to share the ten pairs of shoes that they have when they train on their track, made of crushed coral. The lanes are black coral, with white beach sand sprinkled to mark the lanes. During the rainy season, the track floods, although the athletes still train on it.

The weightlifters do not have a gym to train in; they train behind their coach&#x27;s house. If it starts raining, the weightlifters stop practicing.

<doc id="982482" wikidata="Q5511914" url="?curid=982482" title="G Plan">
<text>G Plan is a British furniture brand. It began as a pioneering range of furniture in the United Kingdom produced by E Gomme Ltd of High Wycombe. The success of G Plan led to E Gomme becoming one of the UK&#x27;s largest furniture manufacturers, with profits increasing sixfold between 1952 and 1958 when it was floated as an IPO. Since 2005, G Plan has been a subsidiary of Sofa Brands International.

==History==
The company was founded in High Wycombe in 1898 by Ebeneezer Gomme, at first making hand-made chairs, and building a factory at Leigh Street in 1909. By 1922 there were 300 employees, and a second factory was opened in 1927 at Spring Gardens, next to the railway line. From 1943, during World War II, furniture sales were controlled by rationing; the Board of Trade set up the Utility scheme which limited the types of furniture on sale and their cost, and a small number of simple designs were available in oak or mahogany. The ending of this scheme in December 1952, combined with the 1951 Festival of Britain, led to a pent-up demand for more modern furniture.

In 1953, Donald Gomme, the designer at E Gomme, decided to produce a range of modern furniture for the entire house which could be bought piece-by-piece according to budgets. Advertising was part of the plan from the beginning. The name was coined by Doris Gundry of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, and the furniture was advertised in magazines and in cinemas direct to the public. Designs were available for several years so people could collect them slowly. All furniture was marked with a distinctive brand mark.

Another part of the direct marketing was the showrooms where the public could see the furniture. There were small centres in the country, and &quot;The G Plan Gallery&quot; in Vogue House, St George Street, Hanover Square in London. Donald Gomme left the company in 1958, perhaps the peak of the company&#x27;s success.

In the early 1960s the government introduced restrictions on hire purchase (the most common method of purchasing furniture), and in response to competition from Danish furniture the company introduced a Danish Modern range (designed by Ib Kofod-Larsen), which made the rest of the range seem dated. Gomme lost their market-leading position, though they continued to be a major manufacturer making innovative designs with a very well known brand name.

In 1987 the Gomme family – major shareholders in the company – decided to retire. They sold the business to the then directors, who, three years later, sold it to the Christie Tyler group of companies. In 1996 the Morris Furniture Group acquired the licence to make and market G Plan Cabinet furniture in Glasgow, operating separately to the upholstery business. G Plan Upholstery Ltd, now based at a modern factory and offices near Melksham, Wiltshire, continues to manufacture most of its sofa and armchair products in the UK.

== Acquisition by Sofa Brands ==
Following the 2005 collapse of Christie Tyler, G Plan was acquired by Sofa Brands International, a holding company, alongside the Parker Knoll and Duresta upholstery brands. G Plan Cabinets was sold by Morris to Sofa Brands in 2015, and cabinet manufacturing ceased.

Sofa Brands was acquired in 2015 by its management team and Promethean Investments, a private equity firm. In the same year the company moved its registered office to G Plan&#x27;s Melksham address. , G Plan was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sofa Brands International.

<text>A Flight Officer Badge is a decoration used by some of the world&#x27;s air forces, to include naval aviation of the world&#x27;s navies, marine forces and coast guards, to denote those who have received training as co-pilots, navigators, observers, or other aircraft officer flight crew personnel. The primary difference between a flight officer and a pilot is that the pilot is responsible for the actual flying and control the aircraft, while the flight officer assists with such duties as navigation and weapons and/or sensor systems operation.

In some commercial airlines, Flight Officer Badges are issued to flight engineers of larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747.

In the United States military, the Naval Flight Officer Badge is issued to officers of the Navy and Marine Corps. The Navigator Badge for officers and Aircrew Badge for enlisted personnel, variations of the Flight Officer Badge, are issued by the Air Force to its Combat Systems Officers and enlisted aircrewmen, respectively.

<text>Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;ruf ash-Shami al-Asadi (; ; ‎ 1526–1585) was an Ottoman polymath active in Cairo and Istanbul. He was the author of more than ninety books on a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, clocks, engineering, mathematics, mechanics, optics, and natural philosophy.

In 1574 the Ottoman Sultan Murad III invited Taqi ad-Din to build an observatory in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. Taqi ad-Din constructed instruments such as an armillary sphere and mechanical clocks that he used to observe the Great Comet of 1577. He also used European celestial and terrestrial globes that were delivered to Istanbul in gift exchanges.

His major work from the use of his observatory is titled &quot;The tree of ultimate knowledge [in the end of time or the world] in the Kingdom of the Revolving Spheres: The astronomical tables of the King of Kings [Murad III]&quot; (&quot;Sidrat al-muntah al-afkar fi malkūt al-falak al-dawār– al-zij al-Shāhinshāhi&quot;). The work was prepared according to the results of the observations carried out in Egypt and Istanbul in order to correct and complete Ulugh Beg&#x27;s 15th century work, the &quot;Zij-i Sultani&quot;. The first 40 pages of the work dealt with calculations, followed by discussions of astronomical clocks, heavenly circles, and information on three eclipses which he observed in Cairo and Istanbul.

As a polymath, Taqi al-Din wrote numerous books on astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, and theology. His method of finding coordinates of stars were reportedly so precise that he got better measurements than his contemporaries, Tycho Brahe and Nicolas Copernicus. Brahe is also thought to have been aware of Taqi al-Din&#x27;s work.

Taqi ad-Din also described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit in 1551. He worked on and created astronomical clocks for his observatory. Taqi ad-Din also wrote a book on optics, in which he determined the light emitted from objects, proved the Law of Reflection observationally, and worked on refraction.

==Biography==
Taqī al-Dīn was born in Damascus in 1526 according to most sources. His ethnicity has been described as Arab, Kurdish and Turkish. In his treatise, titled &quot;Rayḥānat al-rūḥ&quot;, Taqī al-Dīn himself claimed descent from the Ayyubids tracing his lineage back to the Ayyubid prince Nasir al-Din Mankarus ibn Nasih al-Din Khumartekin who ruled Abu Qubays in Syria during the 12th century. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; makes no mention of his ethnicity, simply calling him, &quot;...the most important astronomer of Ottoman Turkey&quot;.

Taqi ad-Din&#x27;s education started in theology and as he went on he would gain an interest in the rational sciences. Following his interest, he would begin to study the rational sciences in Damascus and Cairo. During that time he studied alongside his father Maʿruf Efendi. Al-Dīn went on to teach at various madaris and served as a qadi, or judge, in Palestine, Damascus, and Cairo. He stayed in Egypt and Damascus for some time and while he was there he created work in astronomy and mathematics. His work in these categories would eventually become important. He became a chief astronomer to the Sultan in 1571 a year after he came to Istanbul, replacing Mustafa ibn Ali al-Muwaqqit.

Taqī al-Dīn maintained a strong bond with the people from the Ulama and statesmen. He would pass on information to Sultan Murad III who had an interest in astronomy but also in astrology. The information stated that Ulugh Beg Zij had particular observational errors. Al-Dīn made a suggestions that those errors could be fixed if there were new observations made. He also suggested that an observatory should be created in Istanbul to make that situation easier. Murad III would become a patron of the first observatory in Istanbul. He preferred that construction for the new observatory begin immediately. Since Murad III was the patron he would assist with finances for the project.

Taqī al-Dīn continued his studies at the Galata Tower while this was going on. His studies would continue until 1577 at the nearly complete observatory, which was called Dar al-Rasad al-Jadid. This new observatory contained a library that held books which covered astronomy and mathematics. The observatory, built in the higher part of Tophane in Istanbul, was made of two separate buildings. One building was big and the other one was small. Al-Dīn possessed some of the instruments used in the old Islamic observatories. He had those instruments reproduced and also created new instruments which would be used for observational purposes. The staff at the new observatory consisted of sixteen people. Eight of them were observers or rasids, four of them were clerks, and the last four were assistants.

Taqī al-Dīn approached his observations in a creative way and created new answers to astronomical problems due to the new strategies he created along with the new equipment he created as well. He would go on to create trigonometric tables based on decimal fractions. These tables placed the ecliptic at 23° 28&#x27; 40&quot;. The current value was 23° 27&#x27; showing that al-Dīn&#x27;s instruments and methods were more precise. Al-Dīn used a new method to calculate solar parameters and to determine the magnitude of the annual movement of the sun&#x27;s apogee as 63 seconds. The known value today is 61 seconds. Copernicus came up with 24 seconds and Tycho Brahe had 45 seconds but al-Dīn was more accurate than both.
The main purpose behind the observatory was to cater to the needs of the astronomers and provide a library and workshop so they could design and produce instruments. This observatory would become one of the largest ones in the Islamic world. It was complete in 1579. It would go on to run until January 22, 1580 which is when it was destroyed. Some say religious arguments was the reason why it was destroyed, but it really came down to political problems. A report by the grand vizier Sinan Pasha to Sultan Murad III goes into how the Sultan and the vizier attempted to keep Taqī Ad-Dīn away from the &quot;ulama&quot; because it seemed like they wanted to take him to trial for heresy. The vizier informs the sultan that Taqī Ad-Dīn wanted to go to Syria regardless of the sultan&#x27;s orders. The vizier also warned the sultan that if Taqī Ad-Dīn went there, there is a possibility that he would be noticed by the &quot;ulama&quot; who would take him to trial.

Despite Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s originality, his influence seemed to be limited. There are only a small number of surviving copies of his works so they were not able to reach a wide variety of people. His commentaries that are known are very few. However, one of his works and a piece of a library that he owned reached western Europe pretty quickly. This was due to the manuscript collecting efforts of Jacob Golius, a Dutch professor of Arabic and mathematics at Leiden University. Golius traveled to Istanbul in the early seventeenth century. In 1629 he wrote a letter to Constantijn Huygens that talks about seeing Taqī Ad-Dīn&#x27;s work on optics in Istanbul. He argued that he was not able to get ahold of it from his friends even after all his efforts. He must have succeeded in acquiring it later since Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s work on optics would eventually make it to the Bodleian Library as Marsh 119. It was originally in the Golius collection so it is clear that Golius eventually succeeded at acquiring it.

According to Salomon Schweigger, the chaplain of Habsburg ambassador Johann Joachim von Sinzendorf, Taqi al-Din was a charlatan who deceived Sultan Murad III and had him spent enormous resources.

At the age of 59, after authoring more than ninety books, Taqī al-Dīn passed away in 1585.

==The Constantinople Observatory==
Taqī al-Dīn was both the founder and director of the Constantinople Observatory, which is also known as the Istanbul Observatory. This observatory is frequently said to be one of Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s most important contributions to sixteenth-century Islamic and Ottoman astronomy. In fact, it is known as one of the largest observatories in Islamic history. It is often compared to Tycho Brahe&#x27;s Uraniborg Observatory, which was said to have been the home to the best instruments of its time in Europe. As a matter of fact, Brahe and Taqī al-Dīn have frequently been compared for their work in sixteenth-century astronomy. The founding of the Constantinople Observatory began when Taqī al-Dīn returned to Istanbul in 1570, after spending 20 years in Egypt developing his astronomy and mathematical knowledge. Shortly after his return, Sultan Selīm II appointed Taqī al-Dīn as the head astronomer (Müneccimbaşı), following the death of the previous head astronomer Muṣṭafā ibn ҁAlī al-Muwaqqit in 1571.

During the early years of his position as head astronomer, Taqī al-Dīn worked in both the Galata Tower and a building overlooking Tophane. While working in these buildings, he began to gain the support and trust of many important Turkish officials. These newfound relationships lead to an imperial edict in 1569 from Sultan Murad III, which called for the construction of the Constantinople Observatory. This observatory became home to many important books and instruments, it had sixteen assistants who helped with the making of scientific instruments, as well as many renowned scholars of the time. While there is not much known of the architectural characteristics of the building, there are many depictions of the scholars and astronomical instruments present in the observatory. It was from this observatory that Taqī al-Dīn discovered the Great Comet of 1577, Murad III taught of the comet as a bad omen on the war with the Safavids (he also blamed Taqī al-Dīn for the plague that was occurring at the time). Due to political conflict, this observatory was short lived. It was closed in 1579 and, was demolished entirely by the state on 22 January 1580, only 11 short years after the imperial edict which called for its construction.

=== Politics ===
The rise and fall of Taqī al-Dīn and his observatory depended on political issues that surrounded him. Due to his father&#x27;s occupation as a professor at the Damascene College of law Taqī al-Dīn spent much of his life in Syria and Egypt. During his trips to Istanbul he was able to make connections with many scholar-jurists. He was also able to use the private library of the Grand Vizier of the time, Semiz Ali Pasha. He then began working under Sultan Murad III&#x27;s new Grand Vizier&#x27;s, private mentor Sokollu. Continuing his research on observations of the heavens while in Egypt Taqī al-Dīn used the Galata tower and Sokollu&#x27;s private residence. Although Murad III was the one who commanded an observatory to be built it was actually Sokollu who brought the idea to him knowing about his interest in science. The Sultan ultimately would provide Taqī al-Dīn with everything he needed from financial assistance for the physical buildings, to intellectual assistance making sure he had easy access to many types of books he would need. When the Sultan decided to create the observatory he saw it as a way to show off the power his monarchy had besides just financially backing it. Murad III showed his power by bringing Taqī al-Dīn and some of the most accomplished men in the field of astronomy together to work towards one goal and not only have them work well together but also make progress in the field. Murad III made sure that there was proof of his accomplishments by having his court historiographer Seyyid Lokman keep very detailed records of the work going on at the observatory. Seyyid Lokman wrote that his sultan&#x27;s monarchy was much more powerful than others in Iraq, Persia, and Anatolia. He also claimed that Murad III was above other monarchs because the results of the observatory were new to the world and replaced many others.

=== Instruments used at the Observatory ===
Taqī al-Dīn used a variety of instruments to aid in his work at the observatory. Some were instruments that were already in use from European Astronomers while others he invented himself. While working in this observatory, Taqī al-Dīn not only operated many previously created instruments and techniques, but he also developed numerous new ones. Of these novel inventions, the automatic-mechanical clock is regarded as one of the most important developed in the Constantinople Observatory.
* Each of these instruments were first described by Ptolemy.
** An Armillary Sphere- A model of celestial bodies with rings that represent longitude and latitude.
** A Paralactic Ruler- also known as a Triquetrum was used to calculate the altitudes of celestial bodies.
** An Astrolabe- Measures the inclined position of celestial bodies.
* These instruments were created by Muslim astronomers.
** A Mural quadrant, a type of mural Instrument for measuring angles from 0 to 90 degrees.
** An Azimuthally Quadrant
* Each of the instruments were created by Taqi al-Din to use for his own work.
* A Sunaydi Ruler which was apparently a special type of instrument of an auxiliary nature, the function of which was explained by Alaeddin el-Mansur

==Contributions==

=== Clock mechanics ===

==== Rise of clock use in the Ottoman Empire ====
Before the sixteenth century European mechanical clocks were not in high demand. This lack of demand was brought on by the extremely high prices and the lack of preciseness needed by the population who had to calculate when they would have to have the prayer. The use of hourglasses, water clocks, and sundials was more than enough to meet their needs.

It was not until around 1547 that the Ottomans started creating a high demand for them. Initially, it was started by the gifts brought by the Austrians but this would end up starting a market for the clocks. European clockmakers began to create clocks designed to the tastes and needs of the Ottoman people. They did this by showing both the phases of the moon and by utilizing Ottoman numbers.

==== Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s work ====
Due to this high demand for mechanical clocks, Taqī al-Dīn was asked by the Grand Vizier to create a clock that would show exactly when the call to prayer was. This would lead him to write his first book on the construction of mechanical clocks called, &quot;al-Kawakib al-Durriya fi Bengamat al-Dawriyya&quot; (The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks) in 1563 A.D. which he used throughout his research at the short-lived observatory. He believed that it would be advantageous to bring a &quot;true hermetic and distilled perception of the motion of the heavenly bodies.&quot; In order to get a better understanding of how clocks ran Taqī al-Dīn took the time to gain knowledge from many European clock makers as well as going into the treasury of Semiz Ali Pasha and learning anything he could from the many clocks he owned.

==== Types of clocks examined ====
Of the clocks in the Grand Vizier&#x27;s treasury Taqī al-Dīn examined three different types. Those three were weight-driven, spring-driven, and driven by lever escapement. He wrote of these three types of watches but also made comments on pocket watches and astronomical ones. As Chief Astronomer, Taqī al-Dīn created a mechanical astronomical clock. This clock was made to permit more precise measurements at the Constantinople observatory. As stated above the creation of this clock was thought to be one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the sixteenth century. Taqī al-Dīn constructed a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, minutes, and seconds, with each minute consisting of five seconds. After this clock it is not known whether Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s work in mechanical clocks was ever continued, given that much of the clockmaking after that time in the Ottoman Empire was taken over by Europeans.

=== Steam ===
In 1551 Taqī al-Dīn described a self-rotating spit that is important in the history of the steam turbine. In &quot;Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya&quot; (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines) al-Dīn describes this machine as well as some practical applications for it. The spit is rotated by directing steam into the vanes which then turns the wheel at the end of the axle. Al-Dīn also described four water-raising machines. The first two are animal driven water pumps. The third and fourth are both driven by a paddle wheel. The third is a slot-rod pump while the fourth is a six-cylinder pump. The vertical pistons of the final machine are operated by cams and trip-hammers, run by the paddle wheel. The descriptions of these machines predates many of the more modern engines. The screw pump, for example, that al-Dīn describes predates Agricola, whose description of the rag and chain pump was published in 1556. The two pump engine, which was first described by al-Jazarī, was also the basis of the steam engine.

== Important works ==

=== Astronomy ===
* &quot;Sidrat muntahā al&quot;-&quot;afkār fī malakūt al&quot;-&quot;falak al&quot;-&quot;dawwār&quot; (&quot;al&quot;-&quot;Zīj al&quot;-&quot;Shāhinshāhī&quot;): this is said to be one of Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s most important works in astronomy. He completed this book on the basis of his observations in both Egypt and Istanbul. The purpose of this work was to improve, correct, and ultimately complete &quot;Zīj&quot;-&quot;i Ulugh Beg&quot;, which was a project devised in Samarkand and furthered in the Constantinople Observatory. The first 40 pages of his writing focus on trigonometric calculations, with emphasis on trigonometric functions such sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent.
* &quot;Jarīdat al&quot;-&quot;durar wa kharīdat al&quot;-&quot;fikar&quot; is a zīj that is said to be Taqī al-Dīn&#x27;s second most important work in astronomy. This work contains the first recorded use of decimal fractions in trigonometric functions. He also gives the parts of degree of curves and angles in decimal fractions with precise calculations.
* &quot;Dustūr al&quot;-&quot;tarjīḥ li&quot;-&quot;qawā&quot; &quot;ҁ&quot; &quot;id al&quot;-&quot;tasṭīḥ&quot; is another important work by Taqī al-Dīn, which focuses on the projection of a sphere into a plane, among other geometric topics.
* Taqī al-Din is also accredited as the author of &quot;Rayḥānat al&quot;-&quot;rūḥ fī rasm al&quot;-&quot;sā&quot; &quot;ҁ&quot; &quot;āt&quot; &quot;ҁ&quot; &quot;alā mustawī al&quot;-&quot;suṭūḥ,&quot; which discusses sundials and their characteristics drawn on a marble surface.

=== Clocks and mechanics ===
* &quot;al&quot;-&quot;Kawākib al&quot;-&quot;durriyya fī waḍ&quot; &quot;ҁ&quot; al-&quot;bankāmāt al&quot;-dawriyya was written by Taqī al-Dīn in 1559 and addressed mechanical-automatic clocks. This work is considered the first written work on mechanical-automatic clocks in the Islamic and Ottoman world. In this book, he accredits Alī Pasha as a contributor for allowing him to use and study his private library and collection of European mechanical clocks.

=== Physics and optics ===
* &quot;Nawr ḥadīqat al&quot;-&quot;abṣar wa&quot;-&quot;nūr ḥaqīqat al&quot;-&quot;Anẓar&quot; was a work of Taqī al-Dīn that discussed physics and optics. This book discussed the structure of light, the relationship between light and color, as well as diffusion and global refraction.

<doc id="982557" wikidata="Q1586481" url="?curid=982557" title="Harry Emerson Fosdick">
<text>Harry Emerson Fosdick (May 24, 1878 – October 5, 1969) was an American pastor. Fosdick became a central figure in the fundamentalist–modernist controversy within American Protestantism in the 1920s and 1930s and was one of the most prominent liberal ministers of the early 20th century. Although a Baptist, he was called to serve as pastor, in New York City, at First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan&#x27;s West Village, and then at the historic, inter-denominational Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, Manhattan.

==Career==
Born in Buffalo, New York, Fosdick graduated from Colgate University in 1900 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1904. While attending Colgate University he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He was ordained a Baptist minister in 1903 at Madison Avenue Baptist Church at 31st Street, Manhattan.

He was called as minister to First Baptist Church, Montclair, New Jersey, in 1904, serving until 1915. He supported US participation in the First World War (later describing himself as a &quot;gullible fool&quot; in doing so), and in 1917 volunteered as an Army chaplain, serving in France.

In 1918, he was called to First Presbyterian Church, and on May 21, 1922, he delivered his famous sermon &quot;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&quot;, in which he defended the modernist position. In that sermon he presented the Bible as a record of the unfolding of God&#x27;s will, not as the literal &quot;Word of God&quot;. He saw the history of Christianity as one of development, progress, and gradual change. Fundamentalists regarded this as rank apostasy, and the battle-lines were drawn.

Fosdick&#x27;s sermon prompted a response from the Rev. Clarence Edward Macartney of Arch Street Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia on July 13, 1922, with a sermon entitled &quot;Shall Unbelief Win?&quot;. Like Fosdick&#x27;s sermon, Macartney&#x27;s sermon was published and sent to church leaders across America. &quot;There are not a few,&quot; said Macartney, &quot;who do not think of themselves as either &#x27;Fundamentalists&#x27; or &#x27;Modernists&#x27;, but as Christians, striving amid the dust and the confused clamor of this life to hold the Christian faith and follow the Lord Jesus Christ, who will read this sermon with sorrow and pain.&quot;

The national convention of the General Assembly of the old Presbyterian Church in the USA in 1923 charged his local presbytery in New York to conduct an investigation into Fosdick&#x27;s views. A commission began an investigation, as required. His defense was conducted by a lay elder, John Foster Dulles (1888–1959, future Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s), whose father was a well-known liberal Presbyterian seminary professor. Fosdick escaped probable censure at a formal trial by the 1924 General Assembly by resigning from the First Presbyterian Church (historic &quot;Old First&quot;) pulpit in 1924. He was immediately called as pastor of a new type of Baptist church ministry at Park Avenue Baptist Church, whose most famous member was the industrialist, financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. Rockefeller then funded the famed ecumenical Riverside Church (later a member of the American Baptist Churches and United Church of Christ denominations) in Manhattan&#x27;s northwestern Morningside Heights area near Columbia University, where Fosdick became pastor as soon as the doors opened in October 1930. This prompted a &quot;Time&quot; cover story on October 6, 1930 &quot;(pictured)&quot;, in which &quot;Time&quot; said that Fosdick:
 
Fosdick outspokenly opposed racism and injustice. Ruby Bates credited him with persuading her to testify for the defense in the 1933 retrial of the infamous and racially charged legal case of the Scottsboro Boys, which tried nine black youths before all-white juries for allegedly raping white women (Bates and her companion, Victoria Price) in Alabama.

Fosdick was a guest preacher at Central Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island. 

==Sermons and publications==
Fosdick&#x27;s sermons won him wide recognition. His 1933 anti-war sermon, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, inspired the British priest Dick Sheppard to write a letter that ultimately led to the founding of the Peace Pledge Union. His &quot;Riverside Sermons&quot; was printed in 1958, and he published numerous other books. His radio addresses were nationally broadcast by the BBC; he also wrote the hymn &quot;God of Grace and God of Glory&quot;.

Fosdick&#x27;s book &quot;A Guide to Understanding the Bible&quot; traces the beliefs of the people who wrote the Bible, from the ancient beliefs of the Hebrews (which he regarded as practically pagan) to the faith and hopes of the New Testament writers.

Fosdick was an advocate of theistic evolution. He defended the teaching of evolution in schools and rejected creationism. He was involved in a dispute with the creationist William Jennings Bryan.

Fosdick reviewed the first edition of the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism&quot; in 1939, giving it his approval. Members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) point to this review as significant in the development of the AA movement.

Fosdick was an active member of the American Friends of the Middle East, a founder of the Committee for Justice and Peace in the Holy Land, and an active &quot;anti-Zionist&quot;.

He was a major influence on Martin Luther King Jr. who said that Fosdick was &quot;the greatest preacher of this century.&quot; King drew on Fosdick&#x27;s writings and sermons for some of his own sermons.

==Extended family==

Fosdick&#x27;s brother, Raymond Fosdick, was essentially in charge of philanthropy for John D. Rockefeller Jr., running the Rockefeller Foundation for three decades, from 1921. Rockefeller funded the nationwide distribution of &quot;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&quot;, although with a more cautious title, &quot;The New Knowledge and the Christian Faith&quot;. This direct-mail project was designed by Ivy Lee, who had worked since 1914 as an independent contractor in public relations for the Rockefellers.

Fosdick&#x27;s daughter, Dorothy Fosdick, was foreign policy adviser to Henry M. (&quot;Scoop&quot;) Jackson, a United States Senator from Washington state. She also authored a number of books.

He was the nephew of Charles Austin Fosdick, a popular author of adventure books for boys, who wrote under the pen name Harry Castlemon.

<text>Vanderbilt Peabody College of Education and Human Development (also known as Vanderbilt Peabody College, Peabody College, or simply Peabody) is the education school of Vanderbilt University, a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1875, Peabody had a long history as an independent institution before merging with Vanderbilt University in 1979. The school is located on the Peabody Campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The academic and administrative buildings surround the Peabody Esplanade and are southeast of Vanderbilt&#x27;s main campus.

Peabody College is organized around five academic departments, and conducts research in education, psychology, and human development. The school offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in more than 30 programs.

==History==
=== Early years ===
Peabody College traces its history to 1785 when Davidson Academy was chartered by the state of North Carolina, of which Tennessee was then a part. In 1806, the school moved to downtown Nashville and was rechartered under the name Cumberland College. The institution was renamed once again to the University of Nashville in 1827.

In 1875, when the university was receiving financial assistance from the Peabody Education Fund started by George Peabody, the state legislature amended the charter to establish a State Normal School. The University of Nashville&#x27;s operations were split into three separate entities. Its medical school became part of the newly established Vanderbilt University. Its preparatory school became independent as Montgomery Bell Academy, retaining the board of trustees from the University of Nashville. The literary arts collegiate program received the donation from the Peabody Education Fund and began emphasizing teacher preparation. In 1889, it was renamed Peabody Normal College.

=== George Peabody College for Teachers ===
In 1911, the George Peabody College for Teachers was moved from downtown Nashville to its present location directly across the street from the campus of Vanderbilt University. The location on what was then Nashville&#x27;s western fringe was selected amidst high hopes for collaborations between the two institutions. The land for the new campus, which was donated to Peabody College, included the site of the campus of the former Roger Williams University, a school for African American students which was burned down in a series of arsons around 1906. Peabody was at that time a college for whites, although its &quot;demonstration school&quot; (now the University School of Nashville) became one of the first high schools in Nashville to be desegregated in the early 1960s. Peabody&#x27;s first African American student, Tommie Morton-Young, graduated in 1955.

The design of the Peabody campus was inspired by the classical lines of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s design for the University of Virginia&#x27;s Academical Village and the architecture of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In contrast to the main Vanderbilt University campus, which is characterized by collegiate gothic architecture, Peabody&#x27;s buildings and campus layout are examples of Palladian and Neoclassical styles of architecture.

Peabody became a renowned school of education, especially in the South. Notable faculty during the twentieth century included Joseph Peterson, Susan Gray, and Nicholas Hobbs. Hobbs helped to establish and then directed the John F. Kennedy Center for Education and Human Development at Peabody College. The Kennedy Center was founded in 1965 as one of twelve original university-based centers funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) following the signing of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963.

Peabody seemed financially strong, due in part to an endowment that had been funded in part by its namesake, George Peabody. It had shared some facilities with Vanderbilt for many years, notably the Joint Universities Library, located across the street from Peabody&#x27;s main academic buildings, and indeed closer to Peabody than to much of the main Vanderbilt academic quadrangle. Also, Peabody students were eligible for participation in Vanderbilt ROTC and the Vanderbilt Marching Band.

In the early 1970s Peabody students became eligible to participate in Vanderbilt athletic teams. This was said to be a concession to the fact that Peabody had no intercollegiate athletics of its own, but cynics noted that Peabody did have a major in physical education, a major frequently taken by scholarship athletes but one which had not been available at Vanderbilt, and the decision was seen by many as an attempt to get players onto Vanderbilt sports teams, notably football, who were not academically eligible for admission to Vanderbilt. In 1954, Nancy Reed won the women&#x27;s individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports (DGWS) — which later evolved into the current NCAA women&#x27;s golf championship).

The campus with its 22 main buildings was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 for its early association with George Peabody&#x27;s funding efforts.

=== Merger with Vanderbilt University ===
Peabody College and Vanderbilt University had collaborated in a number of ways since 1914 when classes were first offered on Peabody&#x27;s campus next to Vanderbilt. By the late 1970s a series of serious financial missteps had left Peabody&#x27;s finances in such poor shape that the school&#x27;s choices seemed to be reduced to three: either negotiating mergers with either primarily White Vanderbilt or primarily Black Tennessee State University or closing entirely. The former path was chosen, and Peabody became a part of Vanderbilt in 1979.

===Development as part of Vanderbilt===

For many years following the merger, Peabody maintained a considerable separate identity within Vanderbilt, but this is now somewhat diminished. In 2008, Peabody became the site of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, the housing for all first-year Vanderbilt students.

In an organizational sense, too, Peabody College constitutes a vital part of today&#x27;s Vanderbilt. As one of the university&#x27;s ten schools, it not only trains undergraduate and graduate students – Peabody offers 6 Ph.D. programs, 3 Ed.D. program tracks, and 16 master&#x27;s degree programs – but conducts substantial research in human learning and cognition and an array of other disciplines, including some research collaborations with Vanderbilt University Medical Center. It is now the host of 18 research centers, including two government-funded national research centers: the National Center on School Choice and the National Center on Performance Incentives. Peabody College is consistently ranked among the top graduate schools of education. Over the last 10 years, it has been ranked first among graduate schools of education by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; five times, and seven of its graduate programs are currently ranked among the top five nationally, including #1 rankings for special education and education administration/supervision.

Peabody College publishes the Peabody Journal of Education, the second longest-running publication devoted exclusively to educational research, practice, and policy.

In 2017, Peabody began offering several online degree programs including an online Master of Education (M.Ed.) with a specialization in School Counseling and an online Doctorate of Education (Ed.D.) with a specialization in Leadership and Learning in Organizations.

== Administration and Organization ==
Peabody College&#x27;s current dean is Camilla Benbow, who has served since 1998. Peabody College is organized into five academic departments:
*Department of Human and Organizational Development
*Department of Leadership, Policy, and Organizations
*Department of Psychology and Human Development
*Department of Special Education
*Department of Teaching and Learning

The following is a list of presidents of Peabody College (1875–1979) and its predecessor institutions (1785–1875) and deans of Peabody College after the merger with Vanderbilt University (1979–present).

<doc id="982567" wikidata="Q4805811" url="?curid=982567" title="Ashokan Farewell">
<text>&quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; is a musical piece composed by the American folk musician Jay Ungar in 1982. For many years, it served as a goodnight or farewell waltz at the annual Ashokan Fiddle &amp; Dance Camps, run by Ungar and his wife Molly Mason, who named the tune after the Ashokan Field Campus (now the Ashokan Center) of SUNY New Paltz in Upstate New York.

The tune was used as the title theme of the 1990 PBS television documentary series, &quot;The Civil War&quot;. Despite its late date of composition, it was included in the 1991 compilation album, &quot;Songs of the Civil War&quot;.

==Background==
The piece is a waltz in D major, composed in the style of a Scottish lament (e.g., Niel Gow&#x27;s &quot;Lament for His Second Wife&quot;). Jay Ungar describes the song as coming out of &quot;a sense of loss and longing&quot; after the annual Ashokan Music &amp; Dance Camps ended. The most famous arrangement of the piece begins with a solo violin, later accompanied by guitar and upright bass. Another arrangement, featuring Ungar, Mason, and their family band, is performed with two violins, an acoustic guitar, and a banjo, with the piece beginning with a solo violin.

Before its use as the television series theme, &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; was recorded on &quot;Waltz of the Wind&quot;, the second album by the band Fiddle Fever. The musicians included Ungar and Mason. &quot;Ashokan&quot; was the name of a former village in the Catskill region that is now mostly covered by the Ashokan Reservoir.

==Use in &quot;The Civil War&quot; documentary series==
In 1984, filmmaker Ken Burns heard &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; and was moved by it. He used it in two of his documentary films: &quot;Huey Long&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Civil War&quot; (1990), which features the original recording by Fiddle Fever in the beginning of the film. &quot;The Civil War&quot; drew the greatest attention to the piece. It is played 25 times throughout the eleven-hour series, including during the emotional reading of Sullivan Ballou&#x27;s letter to his wife in the first episode; during another playing, its climactic fermata is timed to coincide with the reveal of the number of casualties from the conflict - the most of any in American history. The song underlies nearly an hour of film. Viewers of &quot;The Civil War&quot; frequently believe the melody is a traditional tune from the Civil War era; in fact, it is the only modern composition on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, as all other music is authentic 19th-century music.

In the wake of the success of the series and its soundtrack album, the track was released as a single by Elektra Nonesuch, backed with the &quot;Sullivan Ballou Letter&quot; recording featuring narrator David McCullough and actor Paul Roebling reading the part of Ballou. It subsequently received airtime on some country music-formatted radio stations, which was timely as the United States entered Operation Desert Storm. Elektra Nonesuch director of media relations Carol Yaple told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;I think [&#x27;Ashokan Farewell&#x27;] was the theme that people could sort of attach the series identity to. However... [the series&#x27; music] is really all of the period. There&#x27;s nothing sexy or contemporary about it, really, except that it was attached to that series and is good music, certainly.&quot;

The song was later used in the &quot;Louie&quot; episode &quot;The Road: Part II&quot;, where Louie dresses up in a Civil War uniform for an old-time photograph.

Most recently, the song is used in the 2018 premiere and 2024 Season 5 finale of the television series &quot;Yellowstone&quot;.

<doc id="982571" wikidata="Q97924952" url="?curid=982571" title="History of video game consoles">
<text>The history of video game consoles, both home and handheld, began in the 1970s. The first console that played games on a television set was the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey, first conceived by Ralph H. Baer in 1966. Handheld consoles originated from electro-mechanical games that used mechanical controls and light-emitting diodes (LED) as visual indicators. Handheld electronic games had replaced the mechanical controls with electronic and digital components, and with the introduction of Liquid-crystal display (LCD) to create video-like screens with programmable pixels, systems like the Microvision and the Game &amp; Watch became the first handheld video game consoles.

Since then, home game consoles have progressed through technology cycles typically referred to as generations. Each generation has lasted approximately five years, during which the major console manufacturers have released console with broadly similar specifications. Handheld consoles have seen similar advances, and are usually grouped into the same generations as home consoles.

While early generations were led by manufacturers like Atari and Sega, the modern home console industry is dominated by three companies: Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. The handheld market has waned since the introduction of mobile gaming in the late 2000s, and today, the only major manufacturer in handheld gaming is Nintendo.

==Origins==
===Home consoles===
The first video games were created on mainframe computers in the 1950s, typically with text-only displays or computer printouts, and limited to simple games like Tic Tac Toe or Nim. Eventually displays with rudimentary vector displays for graphics were available, leading to titles like &quot;Spacewar!&quot; in 1962. &quot;Spacewar!&quot; directly influenced Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney to create &quot;Computer Space&quot; in 1971, the first recognized arcade game.

Separately, while at Sanders Associates in 1966, Ralph H. Baer conceived of the idea of an electronic device that could be connected to a standard television to play games. With Sanders&#x27; permission, he created the prototype &quot;Brown Box&quot; which was able to play a limited number of games, including a version of table tennis and a simple light gun game. Sanders patented the unit and licensed the patents to Magnavox, where it was manufactured as the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, in 1972. Bushnell, after seeing the Odyssey and its table tennis game, believed he could make something better. He and Dabney formed Atari, Inc., and with Allan Alcorn, created their second arcade game, &quot;Pong&quot;. &quot;Pong&quot; first released in 1972 and was more successful than &quot;Computer Space&quot;. Atari released a &quot;Pong&quot; home console through Sears in 1975.

===Handheld consoles===
The origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and tabletop electronic game devices of the 1970s and early 1980s. These electronic devices can only play built-in games, they fit in the palm of the hand or on a tabletop, and they may make use of a variety of video display technologies such as LED, VFD, or LCD. These games derived from the emerging optoelectronic-display-driven calculator market of the early 1970s. 

The first such handheld electronic game was released by Mattel in 1977, where Michael Katz, Mattel&#x27;s new product category marketing director, told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator, using LED technology.&quot; This effort led to the 1977 games &quot;Auto Race&quot; and &quot;Football&quot;. The two games were so successful that according to Katz, &quot;these simple electronic handheld games turned into a &#x27;$400 million category.&#x27;&quot; Another Ralph Baer invention, &quot;Simon&quot;, published by Milton Bradley in 1978, followed, which further popularized such electronic games and remained an enduring property by Milton Bradley (later Hasbro) that brought a number of copycats to the market. Soon, other manufacturers including Coleco, Parker Brothers, Entex, and Bandai began following up with their own tabletop and handheld electronic games.

The transition from handheld &quot;electronic&quot; games to handheld &quot;video&quot; games came with the introduction of LCD screens. These screens gave handheld games the flexibility to play a wide range of games. Milton Bradley&#x27;s Microvision, released in 1979, used a 16x16 pixel LCD screen and was the first handheld to use interchangeable game cartridges.

Nintendo&#x27;s line of &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; titles, first introduced in 1980, was designed by Gunpei Yokoi, who was inspired when he saw a man passing time on a train by playing with an LCD calculator. Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit-card-sized calculators that had appeared on the market, Yokoi designed the series of LCD-based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen, so that they could double as a watch. While the &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series were considered handheld electronic games rather than handheld video game consoles, their success led Nintendo, through Yokoi&#x27;s design lead, to produce the Game Boy in 1989.

== Console generations ==

Like most consumer electronics, home video game consoles are developed based on improving the features offered by an earlier product with advances made by newer technology. For video game consoles, these improvements typically occur every five years, following a Moore&#x27;s law progression where a rough aggregate measure of processing power doubles every 18 months or increases ten-fold after five years. This cyclic market has resulted in an industry-wide adoption of the razorblade model in selling consoles at minimal profit margin while making revenue from the sale of games produced for that console, and then transitioning users to the next console model at the fifth year as the successor console enters the market. This approach incorporates planned obsolescence into the products to continue to bring consumers towards purchasing the newer models.

Because of the industry dynamics, many console manufacturers release their new consoles in roughly the same time period, with their consoles typically offering similar processing power and capabilities as their competitors. This systematic market has created the nature of console generations, categorizing the primary consoles into these segmented time periods that represent consoles with similar capabilities and which shared the same competitive space. Like consoles, these generations typically start five years after its prior one, though may have long tails as popular consoles remain viable well beyond five years.

The use of the generation label came after the start of the 21st century as console technology started to mature, with the terminology applied retroactively to earlier consoles. However, no exact definition and delineation of console generations was consistently developed in the industry or academic literature since that point. Some schemes have been based on direct market data (including a seminal work published in an IEEE journal in 2002), while others are based on technology shifts. Wikipedia itself has been noted for creating its own version of console generation definitions that differ from other academic sources; the definitions from Wikipedia has been adopted by other sources but without having any true rationale behind it. The discrepancies between how consoles are grouped into generations and how these generations are named have caused confusion when trying to compare shifts in the video game marketplace compared to other consumer markets. Kemerer &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) provide a comparative analysis of these different generations through systems released up to 2010 as shown below.

===Timeline===
For purposes of organization, the generations described here and subsequent pages maintain the Wikipedia breakdown of generation, generally breaking consoles apart by technology features whenever possible and with other consoles released in that same period incorporated within that same generation, and starting with the Odyssey and &quot;Pong&quot;-style home consoles as the first generation, an approach that has generally been adopted and extended by video game journalism. In this approach the generation &quot;starts&quot; with the release of the first console considered to have those features, and considered to end with the known last discontinuation of a console in that generation. For example, the third generation is considered to end in 2003 with the formal discontinuation of the Nintendo Entertainment System that year. This can create years with overlaps between multiple generations, as shown.

This approach uses the concepts of &quot;bits&quot;, or the size of individual word length handled by the processors on the console, for the earlier console generations. Longer word lengths generally led to improved gameplay concepts, graphics, and audio capabilities than shorter ones. The use of bits to market consoles to consumers started with the TurboGrafx 16, a console that used an 8-bit central processing unit similar to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), but included a 16-bit graphical processing unit. NEC, the console&#x27;s manufacturer, took to market the console as a &quot;16-bit&quot; system over the NES&#x27; &quot;8-bit&quot; to establish it as a superior system. Other advertisers followed suit, creating a period known as the &quot;bit wars&quot; that lasted through the fifth generation, where console manufactures tried to outsell each other simply on the bit-count of their system. Aside from some &quot;128 Bit&quot; advertising slogans at the beginning of the sixth generation, marketing with bits largely stopped after the fifth generation. Though the bit terminology was no longer used in newer generations, the use of bit-count helped to establish the idea of console generations, and the earlier generations gained alternate names based on the dominant bit-count of the major systems of that era, such as the third generation being the 8-bit era or generation.

Later console generations are based on groupings of release dates rather than common hardware as base hardware configurations between consoles have greatly diverged, generally following trends in generation definition given by video game and mainstream journalism. Handheld consoles and other gaming systems and innovations are frequently grouped within the release years associated with the home console generations; for example the growth of digital distribution is associated with the seventh generation.

== Console history timeline by generation == 
The development of video game consoles primarily follows the history of video gaming in the North American and Japanese markets. Few other markets saw any significant console development on their own, such as in Europe where personal computers tended to be favored alongside imports of video game consoles. The video game clone in less-developed markets like China and Russia were not considered here.

The following table provides an overview of the major hardware technical specifications of the consoles of each major generations by central processor unit (CPU), graphics processor unit (GPU), memory, game media, and other features.

While there is no similar distinction of generations for handheld consoles, they are included in the sections below based on which home console generation they were released. 

=== First generation (1972–1983) ===

The first generation of home consoles were generally limited to dedicated consoles with just one or two games pre-built into the console hardware, with a limited means to alter gameplay factors. In the case of the Odyssey, while it did ship with &quot;game cards&quot;, these did not have any programmed games on them but instead acted as jumpers to alter the existing circuitry pathway, and did not extend the capabilities of the console. Unlike most other future console generations, the first generation of consoles were typically built in limited runs rather than as an ongoing product line.

The first home console was the Magnavox Odyssey in September 1972 based on Baer&#x27;s &quot;Brown Box&quot; design. Originally built from discrete transistors, Magnavox transitioned to integrated circuit chips that were inexpensive, and developed a new line of consoles in the Odyssey series from 1975 to 1977. At the same time, Atari had successfully launched &quot;Pong&quot; as an arcade game in 1972, and began work to make a home console version in late 1974, which they eventually partnered with Sears to the new home &quot;Pong&quot; console by the 1975 Christmas season. &quot;Pong&quot; had several technology advantages over the Odyssey, including an internal sound chip and the ability to track score. Coleco developed the first Telstar console in 1976. With Magnavox, Atari and Coleco all vying in the console space by 1976 and further cost reductions in key processing chips from General Instruments, numerous third-party manufacturers entered the console market by 1977 with ball-and-paddle games. This led to market saturation by 1977, and the industry&#x27;s first market crash. Atari and Coleco attempted to make dedicated consoles with wholly new games to remain competitive, including Atari&#x27;s Video Pinball series and Coleco&#x27;s Telstar Arcade, but by this point, the first steps of the market&#x27;s transition to the second generation of consoles had begun, making these units obsolete near release.

The Japanese market for gaming consoles followed a similar path at this point. Nintendo had already been a business partner with Magnovox by 1971 and helped to design the early light guns for the console. Dedicated home game consoles in Japan appeared in 1975 with Epoch Co.&#x27;s TV Tennis Electrotennis. As in the United States, numerous rival products of these dedicated consoles began to appear, most made by the large television manufacturers like Toshiba and Sharp, and these games would be called &quot;TV geemu&quot; or &quot;terebi geemu&quot; (TV game) as the designation for &quot;video games&quot; in Japan. Nintendo became a major player when Mitsubishi, having lost their manufacturer Systek due to bankruptcy, turned to the company to help continue to build their Color TV-Game line, which went on to sell about 3 million units across four different units between 1977 and 1983.

=== Second generation (1976–1992) ===

The second generation of home consoles was distinguished by the introduction of the game cartridge, where the game&#x27;s code is stored in read-only memory (ROM) within the cartridge. When the cartridge is slotted into the console, the electrical connections allow the main console&#x27;s processors to read the game&#x27;s code from the ROM. While ROM cartridges had been used in other computer applications prior, the ROM game cartridge was first implemented in the Fairchild Video Entertainment System (VES) in November 1976. Additional consoles during this generation, all which used cartridge-based systems, included the Atari 2600 (known as the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) at launch), the Magnavox Odyssey 2, Mattel Electronics&#x27; Intellivision, and the ColecoVision. In addition to consoles, newer processor technology allowed games to support up to 8 colors and up to 3-channel audio effects.

With the introduction of cartridge-based consoles came the need to develop a wide array of games for them. Atari was one of the forefronts in development for its Atari 2600. Atari marketed the console across multiple regions including into Japan, and retained control of all development aspects of the games. Game developments coincided with the Golden age of arcade video games that started in 1978–1979 with the releases of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Asteroids&quot;, and home versions of these arcade games were ideal targets. The Atari 2600 version of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, released in 1980, was considered the killer app for home video game consoles, helping to quadruple the console&#x27;s sales that year. Similarly, Coleco had beaten Atari to a key licensing deal with Nintendo to bring &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as a pack-in game for the Colecovision, helping to drive its sales.

At the same time, Atari has been acquired by Warner Communications, and internal policies led to the departure of four key programmers David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead, who went and formed Activision. Activision proceeded to develop their own Atari 2600 games as well as games for other systems. Atari attempted legal action to stop this practice but ended up settling out of court, with Activision agreeing to pay royalties but otherwise able to continue game development, making Activision the first third-party game developer. Activision quickly found success and were able to generate in revenue from about in startup funds within 18 months. Numerous other companies saw Activision&#x27;s success and jumped into game development to try to make fast money on the rapidly expanding North America video game market. This led to a loss of publishing control and dilution of the game market by the early 1980s. Additionally, in following on the success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, Atari and other companies had remained eager for licensed video game possibilities. Atari had banked heavily on commercial sales of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; in 1982, but it was rushed to market and poorly-received, and failed to make Atari&#x27;s sales estimates. Along with competition from inexpensive home computers, the North American home console market crashed in 1983.

For the most part, the 1983 crash signaled the end of this generation as Nintendo&#x27;s introduction of the Famicom the same year brought the start of the third generation. When Nintendo brought the Famicom to North America under the name &quot;Nintendo Entertainment System&quot;, it helped to revitalize the industry, and Atari, now owned by Jack Tramiel, pushed on sales of the previously successful Atari 2600 under new branding to keep the company afloat for many more years while he transitioned the company more towards the personal computer market. The Atari 2600 stayed in production until 1992, marking the end of the second generation.

==== Handhelds of the second generation ====
Handheld electronic games had already been introduced on the market, such as &quot;Mattel Auto Race&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Simon&quot; in 1978. While not considered video games as lacking the typical video screen element, instead using LED lights as game indicators, they still established a market for portable video games.

The first handheld game console emerged during the second home console generation, using simple LC displays. Early attempts at cartridge-based handheld systems included the Microvision by Milton-Bradley and the Epoch Game Pocket Computer, but neither gained significant traction. Nintendo, on the other hand, introduced its line of &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; portable games, each with a single dedicated game, as its first venture into the video game market. First introduced in 1980, the &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series ran for over a decade and sold more than 40 million units.

=== Third generation (1983–2003) ===
Frequently called the &quot;8-bit generation&quot;, the third generation&#x27;s consoles used 8-bit processors, five audio channels, and more advanced graphics capability including sprites and tiles instead of block-based graphics of the second generation. Further, the third console saw the market dominance shift from the United States to Japan as a result of the 1983 crash.

Both the Sega SG-1000 and the Nintendo Famicom launched near simultaneously in Japan in 1983. The Famicom, after some initial technical recalls, soon gained traction and became the best selling console in Japan by the end of 1984. By that point Nintendo wanted to bring the console to North America but recognized the faults that the video game crash had caused. It took several steps to redesign the console to make it look less like a game console and rebranded it as the &quot;Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; (NES) for North America to avoid the &quot;video game&quot; label stigma. The company also wanted to avoid the loss of publishing control that had occurred both in North America as well as in Asia after the Famicom&#x27;s release, and created a lockout system that required all game cartridges to be manufactured by Nintendo to include a special chip. If this chip was not present, the console would fail to play the game. This further gave Nintendo direct control on the titles published for the system, rejecting those it felt were too mature. The NES launched in North America in 1985, and helped to revitalize the video game market there.

Sega attempted to compete with the NES with its own Master System, released later in 1986 in both the US and Japan, but did not gain traction to compete. Similarly, Atari&#x27;s attempts to compete with the NES via the Atari 7800 in 1987 failed to knock the NES from its dominant position. The NES remained in production until 2003, when it was discontinued along with its successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

=== Fourth generation (1987–2004) ===
The fourth generation of consoles, also known as the &quot;16-bit generation&quot;, further advanced core console technology with 16-bit processors, improving the available graphics and audio capabilities of games.

NEC&#x27;s TurboGrafx-16 (or PC Engine as released in Japan), first released in 1987, is considered the first fourth generation console even though it still had an 8-bit CPU. The console&#x27;s 16-bit graphics processor gave it capabilities comparable to the other fourth generation systems, and NEC&#x27;s marketing had pushed the console being an advancement over the NES as a &quot;16-bit&quot; system. Both Sega and Nintendo entered the fourth generation with true 16-bit systems in the 1988 Sega Genesis (Mega Drive in Japan) and the 1990 Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES, Super Famicom in Japan). SNK also entered the competition with a modified version of their Neo Geo MVS arcade system into the Neo Geo, released in 1990, which attempted to bridge the gap between arcade and home console systems with the shared use of common game cartridges and memory cards. This generation was notable for the so-called &quot;console wars&quot; between Nintendo and Sega primarily in North America. Sega, to try to challenge Nintendo&#x27;s dominant position, created the mascot character Sonic the Hedgehog, who exhibited cool personality to appeal to the Western youth in contrast to Nintendo&#x27;s Mario, and bundled the Genesis with the game of the same name. The strategy succeeded with Sega becoming the dominant player in North America until the mid-1990s.
During this generation, the technology costs of using optical discs in the form of CD-ROMs has dropped sufficiently to make them desirable to be used for shipping computer software, including for video games for personal computers. CD-ROMs offered more storage space than game cartridges and could allow for full-motion video and other detailed audio-video works to be used in games. Console manufacturers adapted by created hardware add-ons to their consoles that could read and play CD-ROMs, including NEC&#x27;s TurboGrafx-CD add-on (as well as the integrated TurboDuo system) in 1988, and the Sega CD add-on for the Genesis in 1991, and the Neo Geo CD in 1994. Costs of these add-ons were generally high, nearing the same price as the console itself, and with the introduction of disc-based consoles in the fifth generation starting in 1993, these fell by the wayside. Nintendo had initially worked with Sony to develop a similar add-on for the SNES, the Super NES CD-ROM, but just before its introduction, business relationships between Nintendo and Sony broke down, and Sony would take its idea on to develop the fifth generation PlayStation. Additionally, Philips attempted to enter the market with a dedicated CD-ROM format, the CD-i, also released in 1990, that included other uses for the CD-ROM media beyond video games but the console never gained traction.

The fourth generation had a long tail that overlapped with the fifth generation, with the SNES&#x27;s discontinuation in 2003 marking the end of the generation. To keep their console competitive with the new fifth generation ones, Nintendo took to the use of coprocessors manufactured into the game cartridges to enhance the capabilities of the SNES. This included the Super FX chip, which was first used in the game &quot;Star Fox&quot; in 1993, generally considered one of the first games to use real-time polygon-based 3D rendering on consoles.

==== Handhelds of the fourth generation ====

Nintendo brought its experience from the &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series to develop the Game Boy system in 1989, with subsequent iterations through the years. The unit included a LCD screen that supported a 4-shade monochrome pixel display, the use of a cartridge-based system, and the means to link up two units to play head-to-head games. One of the early packages included &quot;Tetris&quot; bundled with the unit, which became the Game Boy&#x27;s best-selling game and led the unit to dominate handheld sales at the time. The Game Boy also introduced the Kirby franchise worldwide, which became a staple of Nintendo&#x27;s handheld consoles.

The Atari Lynx was also introduced in 1989 and included a color-LED screen, but its small game library and low battery life failed to make it competitive with the Game Boy. Both Sega and NEC also attempted to compete with the Game Boy with the Game Gear and the TurboExpress, respectively, both released in 1990. Each were attempts to bring the respective home console games to handheld systems, but struggled against the staying power of the Game Boy.

=== Fifth generation (1993–2006) ===
During this time home computers gained greater prominence as a way of playing video games. The video game console industry nonetheless continued to thrive alongside home computers, due to the advantages of much lower prices, easier portability, circuitry specifically dedicated towards video games, the ability to be played on a television set (which PCs of the time could not do in most cases), and intensive first party software support from manufacturers who were essentially banking their entire future on their consoles.

Besides the shift to 32-bit processors, the fifth generation of consoles also saw most companies excluding Nintendo shift to dedicated optical media formats instead of game cartridges, given their lower cost of production and higher storage capacity. Initial consoles of the fifth generation attempted to capitalize on the potential power of CD-ROMs, which included the 3DO and the Atari Jaguar in 1993. However, early in the cycle, these systems were far more expensive than existing fourth-generation models and has much smaller game libraries. Further, Nintendo&#x27;s use of co-processors in late SNES games further kept the SNES as one of the best selling systems over new fifth generation ones.

Two of the key consoles of the fifth generation were introduced in 1995: the Sega Saturn, and the Sony PlayStation, both which challenged the SNES&#x27; ongoing dominance. While the Saturn sold well, it did have a number of technical flaws, but established Sega for a number of key game series going forward. The PlayStation, in addition to using optical media, also introduced the use of memory cards as to save the state of a game. Though memory cards had been used by Neo Geo to allow players to transfer game information between home and arcade systems, the PlayStation&#x27;s approach allowed games to have much longer gameplay and narrative elements, leading to highly-successful role-playing games like &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. By 1996, the PlayStation became the best-selling console over the GBA.

Nintendo released their next console, the Nintendo 64 in late 1996. Unlike other fifth generation units, it still used game cartridges, as Nintendo believed the load-time advantages of cartridges over CD-ROMs was still essential, as well as their ability to continue to use lockout mechanisms to protect copyrights. The system also included support for memory cards as well, and Nintendo developed a strong library of first-party titles for the game, including &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; that helped to drive its sales. While the Nintendo 64 did not match the PlayStation&#x27;s sales, it kept Nintendo a key competitor in the home console market alongside Sony and Sega.

As with the transition from the fourth to fifth generation, the fifth generation has a long overlap with the sixth console generation, with the PlayStation remaining in production until 2006.

==== Handhelds of the fifth generation ====
Nintendo released the Virtual Boy, an early attempt at virtual reality, in 1995. The unit required the player to play a game through a stereoscopic viewerfinder, which was awkward and difficult, and did not lend well to portable gaming. Nintendo instead returned to focus on incremental improvements to the Game Boy, including the Game Boy Pocket and the Game Boy Color.

Sega also released the Genesis Nomad, a handheld unit that played Sega Genesis games, in 1995 in North America only. The unit had been developed through Sega of America with little oversight from Sega&#x27;s main headquarters, and as Sega moved forward, the company as a whole decided to put more focus on the Sega Saturn to stay competitive and drop support for all other ongoing systems, including the Nomad.

Despite Nintendo&#x27;s domination of handheld console market, some competing consoles such as Neo Geo Pocket, WonderSwan, Neo Geo Pocket Color, and WonderSwan Color appeared in the late 1990s and discontinued several years later after their appearance in handheld console market.

=== Sixth generation (1998–2013)===

By the sixth generation, console technology began to catch up to performance of personal computers of the time, and the use of bits as their selling point fell by the wayside. The console manufactures focused on the individual strengths of their game libraries as marketing instead. The consoles of the sixth generation saw further adoption of optical media, expanding into the DVD format for even greater data storage capacity, additional internal storage solutions to function as memory cards, as well as adding support either directly or through add-ons to connect to the Internet for online gameplay. Consoles began to move towards a convergence of features of other electronic living room devices and moving away from single-feature systems.

By this point, there were only three major players in the market: Sega, Sony, and Nintendo. Sega got an early lead with the Dreamcast first released in Japan in 1998. It was the first home console to include a modem to allow players to connect to the Sega network and play online games. However, Sega found several technical issues that had to be resolved before its Western launch in 1999. Though its Western release was more successful than in Japan, the console was soon outperformed by Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 was the first console to add support for DVD playback in addition to CD-ROM, as well as maintaining backward compatibility with games from the PlayStation library, which helped to draw consumers that remained on the long-tail of the PlayStation. While other consoles of the sixth generation had not anticipated this step, the PlayStation 2&#x27;s introduction of backwards compatibility became a major design consideration of future generations. Along with a strong game library, the PlayStation 2 went on to sell 155 million units before it was discontinued in 2013, and , remains the best selling home console of all time. Unable to compete with Sony, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in 2001 and left the hardware market, instead focusing on its software properties. Nintendo&#x27;s entry in the sixth generation was the GameCube in 2001, its first system to use optical discs based on the miniDVD format. A special Game Boy Player attachment allowed the GameCube to use any of the Game Boy cartridges as well, and adapters were available to allow the console to connect to the Internet via broadband or modem.

At this point Microsoft also entered the console market with its first Xbox system, released in 2001. Microsoft considered the PlayStation 2&#x27;s success as a threat to the personal computer in the living room space, and had developed the Xbox to compete. As such, the Xbox was designed based more on Microsoft&#x27;s experience from personal computers, using an operating system built out from its Microsoft Windows and DirectX features, utilizing a hard disk for save game store, built-in Ethernet functionality, and created the first console online service, Xbox Live to support multiplayer games. While the original Xbox had modest sales compared to the PlayStation 2 and was not profitable for the company, Microsoft considered the Xbox to have successfully demonstrated their abilities to participate in the console market.

==== Handhelds of the sixth generation ====

Nintendo continued to refine its Game Boy design with the Game Boy Advance in 2001, including its Game Boy Advance SP in 2003 and Game Boy Micro in 2005, all with the ability to link to the GameCube to extend the functionality of certain games. Also introduced were the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1998 and Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan Color, launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company Game Park introduced its GP32 handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of open source handheld consoles.

During the sixth generation, a new type of market for gaming came from the growing mobile phone arena, where advanced smart phones and other portable devices could be loaded with games. Nokia&#x27;s N-Gage was one of the first devices marketed as a mobile phone and game system, first released in 2003 and later redesigned as the N-Gage QD.

=== Seventh generation (2005–2017) ===

Video game consoles had become an important part of the global IT infrastructure by the mid-2000s. It was estimated that video game consoles represented 25% of the world&#x27;s general-purpose computational power in the year 2007.

By the seventh generation, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo had all developed consoles designed to interface with the Internet, adding networking support for either wired and wireless connections, online services to support multiplayer games, digital storefronts for digital purchases of games, and both internal storage and support for external storage on the console for these games. With the start and transition to the HD era, these consoles also added support for digital television resolutions through HDMI interfaces, but as the generation occurred in the midst of the High-definition optical disc format war between Blu-ray and HD-DVD, a standard for high-definition playback was yet to be fixed. A further innovation came by the use of motion controllers, either built into the console or offered as an add-on afterwards. Consoles in this generation started using custom CPUs based on the PowerPC instruction set, and were increasingly sharing similarities with the personal computer in game development, although with challenges due to the more complex nature of porting between the differences in architectures.

Microsoft entered the seventh generation first with the Xbox 360 in 2005. The Xbox 360 saw several hardware revisions over its lifetime which became a standard practice for Microsoft going forward; these revisions offered different features such as a larger internal hard drive or a fast processor at a higher price point. As shipped, the Xbox 360 supported DVD discs and Microsoft had opted to support the HD-DVD format with an add-on for playback of HD-DVD films. However, this format ended up as deprecated compared to Blu-ray. The Xbox 360 was backward compatible with about half of the original Xbox library. Through its lifetime, the Xbox 360 was troubled by a consistent hardware fault known as &quot;the Red Ring of Death&quot; (RROD), and Microsoft spent over $1 billion correcting the problem.

Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 was released in 2006. The PlayStation 3 represented a shift of the internal hardware from Sony&#x27;s custom Emotion Engine to a PowerPC-based system. Initial PlayStation 3 units shipped with a special Emotion Engine daughterboard that allowed for backwards compatibility of PlayStation 2 games, but later revisions of the unit removed this, leaving only software-based emulation for PlayStation games available. Sony banked on the Blu-ray format, which was included from the start, and partially helped spur the adoption of Blu-Ray as the favoured format for high-definition optical media. With the PlayStation 3, Sony introduced the PlayStation Network for its online services and storefront. While the system would initially have a slow start in the market in part, due to its high price, complex game development environment and initial lack of quality games, the PlayStation 3 eventually became more well received over time following gradual price cuts, improved marketing campaigns, new hardware revisions particularly the Slim models, and key critically acclaimed exclusives.

Nintendo introduced the Wii in 2006 around the same time as the PlayStation 3. Nintendo lacked the same manufacturing capabilities and relationships with major hardware supplies as Sony and Microsoft, and to compete, diverged on a feature-for-feature approach and instead developed the Wii around the novel use of motion controls in the Wii Remote. This &quot;blue ocean strategy&quot;, releasing a product where there was no competition, was considered part of the unit&#x27;s success, and which drove Microsoft and Sony to develop their own motion control accessors to compete. Nintendo provided various online services that the Wii could connect to, including the Virtual Console where players could purchase emulated games from Nintendo&#x27;s past consoles as well as games for the Wii. The Wii used regular sized DVDs for its game medium but also directly supported GameCube discs. The Wii was generally considered a surprising success that many developers had initially overlooked.

The seventh generation concluded with the discontinuation of the PlayStation 3 in 2017.

==== Handhelds of the seventh generation ====
Nintendo introduced the new Nintendo DS system in 2004, a game cartridge-based unit that support two screens including one being touch-sensitive. The DS also included built-in wireless connectivity to the Internet to purchase new DS games or Virtual Console titles, as well as the ability to connect to each other or to a Wii system in an ad hoc manner for certain multiplayer titles. Sony entered the handheld market in 2004 with the PlayStation Portable (PSP), with a reduced design based on the PlayStation 3. Like the DS, the PSP also supported wireless connectivity to the Internet to download new games, and ad hoc connectivity to other PSP or to a PlayStation 3. The PSP used a new format called Universal Media Disc (UMD) for game and other media.

Nokia revived its N-Gage platform in the form of a service for selected S60 devices. This new service launched on April 3, 2008. Other less-popular handheld systems released during this generation include the Gizmondo (launched on March 19, 2005, and discontinued in February 2006) and the GP2X (launched on November 10, 2005, and discontinued in August 2008). The GP2X Wiz, Pandora, and Gizmondo 2 were scheduled for release in 2009.

Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld video game devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Solitaire&quot; had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband. Apple had launched its App Store in 2008 that allowed developers to publish and sell games for iPhones and similar devices, beginning the rise of mobile gaming.

====Other seventh generation hardware====
Based on the success of the Wii Remote controller, both Microsoft and Sony released similar motion detection controllers for their consoles. Microsoft introduced the Kinect motion controller device for the Xbox 360, which served as both a camera, microphone, and motion sensor for numerous games. Sony released the PlayStation Move, a system consisting of a camera and lit handheld controllers, which worked with its PlayStation 3.

=== Eighth generation (2012–2020) ===

Aside from the usual hardware enhancements, consoles of the eighth generation focus on further integration with other media and increased connectivity. Consoles at this point had also standardized on CPUs using the x86 instruction set, the same as in personal computers, and there was a convergence of the individual hardware components between consoles and personal computers, making the porting of games between these systems much easier. Later hardware improvements pushed for higher frame rates at up to 4K resolutions. Digital distribution increased in popularity, while the addition and improvements to remote play capabilities became standard, and second screen experiences via companion apps added more interactivity to games.

The Wii U, introduced in 2012, was considered by Nintendo to be a successor to the Wii but geared to more serious players. The console supported backward compatibility with the Wii, including its motion controls, and introduced the Wii U GamePad, a tablet/controller hybrid that acted as a second screen. Nintendo further refined its network offerings to develop the Nintendo Network service to combine storefront and online connectivity services. The Wii U did not sell as well as Nintendo had planned, as they found people mistook the GamePad to be a tablet they could take with them away from the console, and the console struggled to draw the third-party developers as the Wii had.

Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One came out in 2013. Both were similar improvements over the previous generation&#x27;s respective consoles, providing more computational power to support up to 60 frames per second at 1080p resolutions for some games. Each unit also saw a similar set of revisions and repackaging to develop high- and low-end cost versions. In the case of the Xbox One, the console&#x27;s initial launch had included the Kinect device but this became highly controversial in terms of potential privacy violations and lack of developer support, and by its mid-generation refresh, the Kinect had been dropped and discontinued as a game device. Both consoles eventually released upgraded hardware during their mid-cycle refresh, with Sony releasing the PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft releasing the Xbox One X, which allowed for higher frame rates and up to 4K resolution, in addition to Slim models, marking a departure from previous generations, while adding considerable longevity to this generation cycle.

Later in the eighth generation, Nintendo released the Nintendo Switch in 2017. The Switch is considered the first hybrid game console. It uses a special CPU/GPU combination that can run at different clock frequencies depending on how it is used. It can be placed into a special docking unit that is hooked to a television and a permanent power supply, allowing faster clock frequencies to be used to be played at higher resolutions and frame rates, and thus more comparable to a home console. Alternatively, it can be removed and used either with the attached Joy-Con controllers as a handheld unit, or can be even played as a tablet-like system via its touchscreen. In these modes, the CPU/GPU run at lower clock speeds to conserve battery power, and the graphics are not as robust as in the docked version. A larger suite of online services was removed through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, including several free NES and SNES titles, replacing the past Virtual Console system. The Switch was designed to address many of the hardware and marketing faults around the Wii U&#x27;s launch, and has become one of the company&#x27;s fastest-selling consoles after the Wii.

Game systems in the eighth generation also faced increasing competition from mobile device platforms such as Apple&#x27;s iOS and Google&#x27;s Android operating systems. Smartphone ownership was estimated to reach roughly a quarter of the world&#x27;s population by the end of 2014. The proliferation of low-cost games for these devices, such as &quot;Angry Birds&quot; with over 2 billion downloads worldwide, presents a new challenge to classic video game systems. Microconsoles, cheaper stand-alone devices designed to play games from previously established platforms, also increased options for consumers. Many of these projects were spurred on by the use of new crowdfunding techniques through sites such as Kickstarter. Notable competitors include the GamePop, OUYA, GameStick Android-based systems, the PlayStation TV, the Nvidia Shield, the Apple TV and Steam Machines.

==== Handhelds of the eighth generation ====
The Nintendo 3DS released in 2011 expanded on the Nintendo DS design and added support for an autostereoscopic screen to project stereoscopic 3D effects without the use of 3D glasses. The console was otherwise remained backward compatible with all of the DS titles. Sony introduced its PlayStation Vita in 2011, a revised version of the PSP but eliminating the use of external media and focusing on digital acquisition of games, as well as incorporating a touchscreen. and was released in Europe and North America on February 22, 2012.

As noted above, the Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console, capable of both being used as a home console in its docked mode and as a handheld. The Nintendo Switch Lite revision was released in 2019, which reduced some of the features of the system and its size, including eliminating the ability to dock the unit, making the Switch Lite primarily a handheld system, but otherwise compatible with most of the Switch&#x27;s library of games.

====Other eighth generation hardware====
Virtual reality systems appeared during the eighth generation, with three main systems: the PlayStation VR headset that worked with PlayStation 4 hardware, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive which ran off a personal computer.

=== Ninth generation (2020–present) ===

Both Microsoft and Sony released successors to their home consoles in November 2020. Consoles in this generation also launched with lower-cost models lacking optical disc drives, targeting those who would prefer to purchase games exclusively through digital downloads. Both console families target 4K and 8K resolution televisions at high frame rates, support for real-time ray tracing rendering, 3D spatial audio, variable refresh rates, the use of high-performance solid-state drives (SSD) as internal high-speed memory to make delivering game content much faster than reading from optical disc or standard hard drives, which can eliminate loading times and support in-game streaming. With features that were commonly standard in PCs, and the move to higher performance APUs, consoles in the ninth generation now have capabilities comparable to high-end personal computers, often making cross-platform development easier and more widely available than previously, further converging and blurring the line between video game consoles and personal computers.

Microsoft released the fourth generation of Xbox with the Xbox Series X and Series S on November 10, 2020. The Series X has a base performance target of 60 frames per second at 4K resolution to be four times as powerful as the Xbox One X. One of Microsoft&#x27;s goals with both units was to assure backward compatibility with all games supported by the Xbox One, including those original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that are backward compatible with the Xbox One, allowing the Xbox Series X and Series S to support four generations of games.

Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 was released on November 12, 2020, and also is a similar performance boost over the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation 5 uses a custom SSD solution with much higher input/output rates that are almost comparable to RAM chip speeds, significantly improving rendering and data streaming speeds. The chip architecture is comparable to the PlayStation 4, allowing backwards compatible with most of the PlayStation 4 library while select games will need chip timing tweaking to make them compatible.

In terms of handhelds, Sony has announced no further plans for handhelds after discontinuing the Vita, while Nintendo continues to offer the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite. The market here still continues to compete with the growing mobile gaming market, but developers have taken advantage of new opportunities in cross-platform play support, in part due to the popularity of &quot;Fortnite&quot; in 2018, to make games that are compatible on consoles, computers, and mobile devices. Cross platform is now used widely in various games. Cloud gaming also is seen as a potential replacement of handheld gaming. While earlier cloud gaming platforms have gone by the wayside, newer approaches including PlayStation Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Google&#x27;s Stadia (discontinued in 2023) and Amazon Luna can deliver computer and console-quality gameplay to nearly any platform including mobile devices, limited by bandwidth quality.

<text>Slavenka Drakulić (born July 4, 1949) is a Croatian journalist, novelist, and essayist whose works on feminism, communism, and post-communism have been translated into many languages.

==Biography==
Drakulić was born in Rijeka, Socialist Republic of Croatia (at that time, part of socialist Yugoslavia), on July 4, 1949. She graduated in comparative literature and sociology from the University in Zagreb in 1976. From 1982 to 1992, she was a staff writer for the &quot;Start&quot; bi-weekly newspaper and news weekly &quot;Danas&quot; (both in Zagreb), writing mainly on feminist issues. In addition to her novels and collections of essays, Drakulić&#x27;s work has appeared in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Internazionale&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;La Stampa&quot;, &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, Eurozine, &quot;Politiken&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She is a contributing editor for &quot;The Nation&quot;. She lives in Croatia and in Sweden.

Drakulić temporarily left Croatia for Sweden in the early 1990s for political reasons during the Yugoslav wars. A notorious unsigned 1992 &quot;Globus&quot; article (Slaven Letica subsequently admitted to being its author) accused five Croatian female writers, Drakulić included, of being &quot;witches&quot; and of &quot;raping&quot; Croatia. According to Letica, these writers failed to take a definitive stance against rape as allegedly planned military tactic by Bosnian Serb forces against Croats, and rather treated it as crimes of &quot;unidentified males&quot; against women. Soon after the publication, Drakulić started to receive telephone threats; her property was also vandalized. Finding little or no support from her erstwhile friends and colleagues, she decided to leave Croatia.

Her noted works relate to the Yugoslav wars. &quot;As If I Am Not There&quot; is about crimes against women in the Bosnian War, while &quot;They Would Never Hurt a Fly&quot; is a book in which she also analyzed her experience overseeing the proceedings and the inmates of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague. Both books touch on the same issues that caused her wartime emigration from the home country. In scholarly circles, she is better known for her two collections of essays: &quot;How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed&quot; and &quot;Cafe Europa&quot;. These are both non-fiction accounts of Drakulić&#x27;s life during and after communism.

Her 2008 novel, &quot;Frida&#x27;s Bed&quot;, is based on a biography of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Her 2011 book of essays, &quot;A Guided Tour Through the Museum of Communism: Fables from a Mouse, a Parrot, a Bear, a Cat, a Mole, a Pig, a Dog, &amp; a Raven&quot;, was published by Penguin in the US, and was widely reviewed to great acclaim. The book consists of eight reflections told from the point of view of a different animal. Each beast reflects on the remembrance of communism in different countries in Eastern Europe. In the second-to-last chapter, a Romanian dog explains that under capitalism everyone is unequal &quot;but some are more unequal than others&quot;, an inversion of a famous George Orwell quote from Animal Farm.

In 2021, Drakulić published a new essay collection, &quot;Café Europa Revisited: How to Survive Post-Communism&quot;, which reflected on the continued divisions between Eastern and Western Europe even thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The title of this book refers back to the two essay collections she published in the 1990s, &quot;How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed&quot; (1992) and &quot;Café Europa: Life After Communism&quot; (1997), and attempts to take stock of the last three decades of changes. Drakulić writes about the bitter disappointments felt by many East Europeans who expected that the revolutions of 1989 would usher in a new era of democracy and prosperity. Instead, the essays in this collection reveal that East Europeans still feel like second class citizens. In her chapter discussing what she calls &quot;European food apartheid,&quot; Drakulić describes how investigators found that Western corporations sold lower quality products in the East under the same brand names and packaging they use in the West: fish sticks with less fish in them and biscuits made with cheaper palm oil instead of butter. Drakulić also ruminates on the persistence of post-communist nostalgia in the region, as people try to grapple with both the positive and negative legacies of their collective pasts. She writes, “In all former communist countries in Eastern Europe, it is difficult to mention the merits of communism, a system that, in a short time, brought modernization and changed an agrarian society into an urbanized, industrial one. It meant general education as well as the emancipation of women; this has to be recognized, even though such changes were accomplished by a totalitarian regime.” 

Drakulić lives in Stockholm and Zagreb. In 2020, she contracted a severe case of COVID-19 and was hospitalized for twelve days in an intensive care unit, six of which she spent on a ventilator.

<doc id="982578" wikidata="Q1755580" url="?curid=982578" title="Tin soldier">
<text>Tin soldiers are miniature toy soldiers that are very popular in the world of collecting. They can be bought finished or in a raw state to be hand-painted. They are generally made of pewter, tin, lead, other metals or plastic. Often very elaborate scale models of battle scenes, known as dioramas, are created for their display.
Tin soldiers were originally almost two-dimensional figures, often called &quot;little Eilerts&quot; or &quot;flats&quot;. They were the first toy soldiers to be mass-produced. Though largely superseded in popularity from the late 19th century by fully rounded three-dimensional lead figures, these flat tin soldiers continue to be produced.

==History==
The first mass-produced tin soldiers were made in Germany as a tribute to Frederick the Great during the 18th century. Johann Gottfried Hilpert (1748–1832) and his brother Johann Georg Hilpert (1733–1811) established an early assembly-line in 1775 for soldiers and other figures; female painters applied a single color on each figurine as it was passed around the workshop. Hilpert, living in Nuremberg was probably the first to create them as a mass-produced toy. The world&#x27;s largest Tin Soldier is located in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.

==Casting==
&quot;Real&quot; tin soldiers, i.e., ones cast from an alloy of tin and lead, can also be home-made. Moulds are available for sale in some hobby shops. Earlier, the moulds were made of metal; currently, they are often made of hard rubber which can stand the temperature of the molten metal, around .

==Popular culture==
 The best-known tin soldier in literature is the unnamed title character in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s 1838 fairy tale &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot;. It concerns a tin soldier who had only one leg because &quot;he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him.&quot; He falls in love with a dancer made of paper and after much adventuring, including being swallowed by a fish, the two are consumed together by fire, leaving nothing but tin melted &quot;in the shape of a little tin heart.&quot;
Tin soldiers also play a role in &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; as well as &quot;Knight&#x27;s Castle&quot; by Edward Eager.

<text>HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; (D37) was a British Royal Navy aircraft carrier, of the , converted merchant vessels, and one of the shortest-lived escort carriers. She served in the Second World War and sank on 27 March 1943.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Avenger&quot;-class escort carriers were converted U.S. Maritime Commission (USMC) type C3 American merchant ships. Their design was based on the United States Navy″s (AVG1). To differentiate between the two classes, the Royal Navy ships were prefixed with a &#x27;B&#x27; (BAVG).

HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; (BAVG4) was built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania. The ship was originally named &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, intended for passenger/cargo service with Moore-McCormack Lines, laid down as yard hull 189, USMC hull 62 on 14 March 1940, launched on 11 April 1941. She was converted to an escort aircraft carrier in the Tietjen &amp; Lang shipyards New Jersey and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 2 July 1942.

&quot;Dasher&quot; had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the half hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised three single-mounted 4-inch dual-purpose guns, two forward and one aft, and fifteen 20 mm cannon on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for 15 aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighters and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers.

==Service history==

The ship was transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned into RN service as HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; (D37) on 2 July 1942. She participated in Operation Torch, with her sister ship , carrying Sea Hurricanes of 804 Naval Air Squadron. After aircraft ferry duties in the Mediterranean, &quot;Dasher&quot; sailed to the Clyde in March 1943 and, having had her flight-deck lengthened by , she embarked Fairey Swordfish aircraft. She escorted one convoy successfully, but shortly after leaving with the second, &quot;Dasher&quot; suffered engine trouble and turned back. Shortly after getting to the Firth of Clyde on 27 March 1943, she suffered a major internal explosion and sank.

===Loss===

Various possible causes have been suggested, including one of her aircraft crashing onto the flight deck and igniting petrol fumes from leaking tanks. Much of what happened remains unknown. The death toll, 379 out of 528 crewmen, despite rapid response and assistance from ships and rescue craft from Brodick and Lamlash on the Isle of Arran and from Ardrossan and Greenock on the Scottish mainland, was amongst the highest in British home waters. Many escaped from the ship but died of hypothermia or of burns suffered when escaped fuel ignited on the water. Most of the dead were buried at Ardrossan or Greenock.

The British blamed the bad design of the stowage and handling, while the US blamed the disaster on poor RN petrol-handling procedures. There were merits in both arguments, but thereafter the stowage on her British-operated sister ships was reduced from down to , and the USN reduced theirs also but not as drastically.

The government of the time, eager to avoid damage to morale and anxious to avoid any suggestion of faulty US construction, tried to cover up the sinking. The local media were ordered to make no reference to the tragedy.

There were rumours that the authorities ordered the dead to be buried in an unmarked mass grave, but none had been found , and the Royal Navy said that a mass unmarked grave would have been against Admiralty policy and that all sources relating to the sinking of HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; are in the public domain.

A witness said in 2021 that survivors had told her that there was a mortuary where they were taken to identify about fifty bodies laid out, &quot;just dumped&quot;. People living nearby saw the bodies over a high wall, &quot;then they all disappeared&quot;.

Furious relatives protested and some of the dead were returned to their families for burial. The survivors were ordered not to talk about what happened. This policy subsequently attracted much criticism. There are now memorials to those lost at both Ardrossan and Brodick.

The wreck site lies approximately halfway on the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry route between Ardrossan and Brodick and is a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act.

Teak boards from the flight deck of &quot;Dasher&quot; washed up on the beach at Ardrossan in 1999. They were riddled with tubes made by burrowing teredo worms. A section of this wood featured in the &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot; exhibition in the Millennium Dome and another piece is held by the North Ayrshire Heritage Centre in Saltcoats.

There has been speculation that one corpse from the sinking was used during the British deception Operation Mincemeat (&quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;). The case is argued by authors John and Noreen Steele in their 2002 book &quot;The Secrets of HMS Dasher&quot;, however, this theory was disproved in 2010.

Contrary to Steeles claim that &quot;Dasher&quot; sank quickly after the incident, several eye witnesses reports at the time reported the hull of an aircraft carrier being beached for salvage and recovery on the shore north of Ardrossan the following day.

HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; was subsequently towed into the Clyde and scuttled during the following days by the Admiralty further covering the accident.

These accounts debunk the Steeles&#x27; published theory of events which, over time have been broadly accepted by many as a factual account of &quot;Dasher&#x27;s&quot; loss.

An archaeological dig was undertaken in October 2012 to ascertain whether there was a mass grave within Ardrossan Cemetery containing bodies from &quot;Dasher&quot;. No evidence was found that the ground in the area searched had been disturbed.

<text>Ankole was a traditional Bantu kingdom in Uganda and lasted from the 15th century until 1967. The kingdom was located in south-western Uganda, east of Lake Edward.

==Geography==

The kingdom of Ankole is located in the South-Western region of Uganda bordering Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ankole is Home to some of the most favorable grazing lands in Africa:
==History==
The kingdom was ruled by a monarch known as the &quot;Mugabe&quot; or &quot;Omugabe&quot;. The people of Ankole are called Banyankore (singular: Munyankore) in Runyankole language, a Bantu language.

===Under the Empire of Kitara===
Before the collapse of the Empire of Kitara, Ankole, or as it was known back then, Kaaro-Karungi ‘the good village’, was a small and remote area on the edges of the empire.

===Founding===
According to legend, the first (and semi-legendary) king of Ankole, Ruhinda Rwa Njunaki, was born as the illegitimate son of Wamara (or Ndahura), the last emperor of the Empire of Kitara. His mother was known as Njunaki and was a servant in the king&#x27;s palace.

===Colonial and post-colonial periods===
On 25 October 1901, the Kingdom of Nkore was incorporated into the British Protectorate of Uganda by the signing of the Ankole agreement.

The kingdom was formally abolished in 1967 by the government of President Milton Obote, and since then, the kingdom has not been restored officially.

Because of the reorganisation of the country by Idi Amin, Ankole no longer exists as an administrative unit. It is divided into ten districts, namely: Bushenyi District, Buhweju District, Mitooma District, Rubirizi District, Sheema District, Ntungamo District, Mbarara District, Kiruhura District, Ibanda District, and Isingiro District.

==Culture and society==

===Pre-colonial ethnic relations in Ankole===
The kingdom of Ankole expanded by annexing territory to the south and east. In many cases, conquered herders were incorporated into the dominant Hima stratum of society, and Bantu agricultural populations were adopted slaves and treated as legal inferiors. Neither group could own cattle, and slaves could not herd cattle owned by the Hima.

Ankole society evolved into a system of ranked statuses, where even among the cattle-owning elite, patron-client ties were important in maintaining social order. Men gave cattle to the king (mugabe) to demonstrate their loyalty and to mark life-cycle changes or victories in cattle raiding. This loyalty was often tested by the king&#x27;s demands for cattle or for military service. In return for homage and military service, a man received protection from the king, both from external enemies and from factional disputes with other cattle owners.

The mugabe authorized his most powerful chiefs to recruit and lead armies on his behalf, and these warrior bands were charged with protecting Ankole borders. Only Hima men could serve in the army, however, and the prohibition on Iru military training almost eliminated the threat of Iru rebellion. Iru legal inferiority was also symbolized in the legal prohibition against Bantu owning cattle. And, because marriages were legitimized through the exchange of cattle, this prohibition helped reinforce the ban on Hima-Bantu intermarriage. The Iru were also denied highlevel political appointments, although they were often appointed to assist local administrators in Bantu villages.

The Iru had a number of ways to redress grievances against Hima overlords, despite their legal inferiority. Iru men could petition the king to end unfair treatment by a Hima patron. Bantu people could not be subjugated to Hima cattle-owners without entering into a patron-client contract.

A number of social pressures worked to destroy Hima domination of Ankole. Miscegenation took place despite prohibitions on intermarriage, and children of these unions (abambari) often demanded their rights as cattle owners, leading to feuding and cattle-raiding. From what is present-day Rwanda groups launched repeated attacks against the Hima during the nineteenth century. To counteract these pressures, several Hima warlords recruited Bantu men into their armies to protect the southern borders of Ankole.

Banyankore trace their ancestors back to Iru and the Bahima subgroup.

Aili M. Tripp describes the role of women in the kingdom of Ankole:

<text>The Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din, founded in Constantinople (today Istanbul) by Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;ruf in 1577, was one of the largest astronomical observatories in the pre-modern world. However, it only existed for a few years and was destroyed in 1580.

==History==
In 1574, Murad III became the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The empire&#x27;s chief astronomer, Taqi ad-Din, petitioned the Sultan to finance the building of a great observatory to rival Ulugh Beg&#x27;s Samarkand observatory. The Sultan approved, and construction was completed in 1577, at nearly the same time as Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observatory at Uraniborg.

This observatory consisted of two large structures perched on a hill overlooking the European section of Constantinople and offering a wide view of the night sky. Much like a modern institution, the main building was reserved for the library and the living quarters of the staff, while the smaller building housed a collection of instruments built by Taqi ad-Din. These included a giant armillary sphere and an accurate mechanical astronomical clock for measuring the position and speed of the planets. With these instruments, Taqi ad-Din had hoped to update the old astronomical tables describing the motion of the planets, sun, and moon.

The observatory did not survive to advance the development of astronomy in the Muslim world. Within months of the observatory&#x27;s completion, a comet with an enormous tail appeared in the sky and Sultan Murad III demanded a prognostication about it from his astronomer. &quot;Working day and night without food and rest&quot; Taqi ad-Din studied the comet and came up with the prediction that it was &quot;an indication of well-being and splendor,&quot; and would mean a &quot;conquest of Persia&quot;. Unfortunately, instead of splendor, a devastating plague followed in some parts of the empire, and several important persons died. Astronomy was a respected and approved science among the Islamic clergy of the Ottoman Empire, yet the same could not be said with regard to astrology, a field which is considered to be divination and thus against sharia. In order to prevent its further use for astrological purposes, they successfully sought the observatory&#x27;s destruction. This happened just as the king of Denmark built an observatory for Tycho Brahe that would pave the way for Kepler&#x27;s elucidation of the orbits of planets.

==Instruments==

Taqi ad-Din wrote an important treatise on astronomical instruments entitled the &quot;Observational Instruments of the Emperor&#x27;s Catalogue&quot;, which describes the astronomical instruments used in the Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din. These included ancient instruments such as the armillary sphere, paralactic ruler and astrolabe; medieval Muslim instruments such as the universal astrolabe, azimuthal and mural quadrants, and sextants; and several instruments he invented himself, including the &quot;mushabbaha bi&#x27;l manattiq&quot;, a framed sextant with cords for the determination of the equinoxes similar to what Tycho Brahe later used, and a wooden quadrant for measuring azimuths and elevations. His most important astronomical instrument, however, is the &quot;observational clock&quot;, which in his &quot;In the Nabk Tree of the Extremity of Thoughts&quot;, he describes as &quot;a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, the minutes, and the seconds. We divided each minute into five seconds.&quot; This was used for measuring the right ascension of the stars. This is considered one of the most important innovations in 16th century practical astronomy, as at the start of the century clocks were not accurate enough to be used for astronomical purposes.

A &quot;remarkably modern-looking&quot; terrestrial globe of the Earth, one of the earliest of its kind, was constructed by Taqi ad-Din at the Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din.

==Observations==

Taqi ad-Din made use of his new &quot;observational clock&quot; to produce a zij (named &quot;Culmination of Thoughts in the Kingdom of Rotating Spheres&quot;) more accurate than his predecessors, Tycho Brahe and Nicolaus Copernicus. Taqi ad-Din was also the first astronomer to employ a decimal point notation in his observations rather than the sexagesimal fractions used by his contemporaries and predecessors. He also made use of Al-Biruni&#x27;s method of &quot;three points observation&quot;. In &quot;The Culmination of Thoughts in the Kingdom of Rotating Spheres&quot;, Taqi ad-Din described the three points as &quot;two of them being in opposition in the ecliptic and the third in any desired place on the ecliptic. He used this method to calculate the eccentricity of the Sun&#x27;s orbit and the annual motion of the apogee, and so did Tycho Brahe and Copernicus shortly afterwards, though Taqi ad-Din&#x27;s values were more accurate, due to his observational clock and other more accurate instruments.

<text>HMS &quot;Biter&quot; was a Royal Navy escort carrier during the Second World War. She was laid down as a merchant ship at the Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company yard at Chester, Pennsylvania. Laid down on 28 December 1939, she was converted to an escort carrier and commissioned in the Royal Navy on 6 May 1942. She was returned to the United States in 1945 and subsequently lent to France.

==Design and description==
&quot;Biter&quot; was an . These carriers were converted American type C3 merchant ships. Their design was based on the U.S. Navy′s (AVG); to differentiate between the two classes, the Royal Navy added the prefix &quot;B&quot; (BAVG). HMS &quot;Biter&quot; (BAVG3) was built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, originally named the &quot;Rio-Parana&quot;; she was laid down on 28 December 1939, launched on 18 December 1940 and delivered on 4 September 1941. She was converted to an escort carrier in the Atlantic Basin Iron Works at Brooklyn New York and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 6 May 1942, under the command of Captain Conolly Abel Smith.

&quot;Biter&quot; had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift, one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the half hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised three single mounted  dual purpose guns and fifteen 20 mm cannons on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for fifteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighters and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger torpedo bombers (also used for anti-submarine patrols).

==Service history==
After commissioning, &quot;Biter&quot; was being readied to leave New York when a fire broke out on 8 May 1942, in the catapult house which destroyed one of the catapult motors. Eventually believed ready for sea, she left the dock on 15 May but had to return to rectify an engine problem. Ready again for sea, she left on gunnery trials on 30 May and landed her first aircraft—a Fairey Swordfish—on 2 June. After completing flying trials, she left for Nova Scotia on 12 June, with one of her Swordfish flying anti-submarine patrols &quot;en route&quot;. Leaving Nova Scotia for Britain on 14 June, she again suffered from engine problems which cast her adrift for three hours while they were repaired. She continued to suffer from engine problems crossing the Atlantic, and on 17 September a depth charge-armed Swordfish crashed into her island on landing. After 75 minutes, they managed to safely drop the charge overboard. Arriving at Greenock on 23 June, she entered dock for modifications and to lengthen her wooden flight deck. On 2 September, she took part in landing trials with a Fairey Fulmar and practised landings and takeoffs with other Fleet Air Arm aircraft in the following weeks and exercised in oiling her escort vessels. On 1 October, &quot;Biter&quot; arrived in Scapa Flow, where she was joined on 10 October by . Her first fighters arrived on 14 October; 15 Sea Hurricanes belonging to No. 800 Naval Air Squadron. These planes were Sea Hurricane IB&#x27;s armed with twelve  machine guns and ICs armed with four 20 mm cannons. The two escort carriers—joined by the fleet carrier —left for Greenock on 16 October to join the British forces taking part in the North Africa landings Operation Torch.
===Operation Torch===
For the Torch landings, &quot;Biter&quot; was part of the covering force off Oran. The force comprised the battleship , the carriers and , the light cruiser and nine destroyers. Flying operations began on 8 November 1942, but after a Sea Hurricane crashed into her bridge &quot;Biter&quot; was temporarily put out of action. One Sea Hurricane was shot down by a Vichy French Dewoitine D.520. Both &quot;Biter&quot; and &quot;Dasher&quot; were sent back to Gibraltar on 10 November. &quot;Biter&quot; joined a convoy for Greenock and arrived without incident on 19 November and went to Dundee for an overhaul. In February 1943, &quot;Biter&quot; joined &quot;Argus&quot; and her destroyer escorts on an anti-submarine exercise and then left for Iceland on 13 April accompanied by the destroyers and arriving on 17 April. Along with HMS &quot;Pathfinder&quot; these ships formed 5th Support Group, commanded by Captain Conolly Abel-Smith.

===Convoy ONS 4===
&quot;Biter&quot; had taken aboard No. 811 Naval Air Squadron under Lieutenant-Commander A.J.B Forde. This was a composite squadron equipped with nine Fairey Swordfish and three Grumman Martlets. On 21 April, &quot;Biter&quot; departed Iceland with convoy ONS 4 bound for Argentia. Captain Abel-Smith had decided to shadow the convoy from a distance believing this would provide them with greater opportunities to engage shadowing U-boats. Two Swordfish were kept at immediate readiness to take off and engage any submarine sightings. On 23 April, one of the patrolling Swordfish sighted a U-boat on the surface but it had dived before they got into an attacking position. That same afternoon, another U-boat was sighted by the convoy; they signalled &quot;Biter&quot;, which was away. By the time the lone Swordfish dispatched had arrived, the U-boat () had been sunk by . &quot;Biter&quot; kept up her anti-submarine patrols over the next days and on 25 April, the radar operator on &quot;Biter&quot; reported a submarine contact. The destroyer dispatched to investigate could not find anything, then at 16:25 a Swordfish sighted a U-boat on the surface only from &quot;Biter&quot;. Dropping two depth charges the Swordfish reported the sighting and another Swordfish and were sent to assist. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; followed up the Swordfish attack with depth charges of her own, and at 18:40 surfaced and was abandoned by her crew. The convoy safely reached Argentia on 19 April without any loss but had sunk two U-boats.

===Convoy HX 237===

&quot;Biter&quot; and her destroyers left Argentia on 5 May to join the home bound convoy HX 237, which was escorted by 2nd Canadian Escort Group. At first Abel Smith refused to place his support group in the convoy but was subsequently ordered to do so by the Admiralty. Fog prevented any flying until 07:30 on 7 May, when two Swordfish took off and located the convoy and provided an anti-submarine patrol. The carrier and escorts arrived an hour later. Two Martlets which until now had been idle took part in a patrol but lost the convoy and had to ditch beside a straggling merchant ship which rescued the crews. Ordered to close with the convoy by the Commander-in Chief (C-in-C) Western Approaches bad weather prevented any flying until after 16:00 on 10 May. The Swordfish responded to a sighting of a U-boat on the surface dropping two depth charges but was hit by anti-aircraft fire from the submarine. A second Swordfish had taken off to assist but could not find the U-boat or the convoy in the bad weather and was forced to ditch beside a straggling merchant ship. On 11 May, a Swordfish engaged another U-boat on the surface which initially fought back with her guns but was eventually forced to dive. The next morning, the patrolling Swordfish reported a U-boat sighting and was never heard from again. It was because of these last engagements that aircraft were ordered to fly in pairs, they were forbidden to fight it out with surfaced submarines and only to attack if it was diving. That afternoon a Swordfish sighted and attacked a U-boat diving only from the convoy. The same U-boat, , was located and sunk by two of the escorts, , a , and , a . On 13 May, the convoy had come within range of RAF Coastal Command Consolidated Liberators and Short Sunderlands. Two Swordfish took off at dawn and discovered two surfaced U-boats, which were attacked by a patrolling Sunderland of No.423 Squadron RCAF from RAF Castle Archdale. Another U-boat was located by a Swordfish at 09:00 and attacked as she was diving with no visible effect. Two U-boats were engaged by aircraft and escorts and sunk; these were &quot;U-456&quot;, sunk by HMS &quot;Opportune&quot; and a Liberator of No. 86 Squadron from RAF Aldergrove, and HMS &quot;Lagan&quot;, and &quot;U-753&quot;, sunk by the and HMS &quot;Lagan&quot;.
===Convoy SC 129===
With HX 237 now under land-based aircraft cover, the C-in-C Western Approaches ordered &quot;Biter&quot; and her escorts south, where the eastbound convoy SC 129 was being threatened by a gathering wolfpack. On 15 May, light winds over the flight deck, and the inability of the Swordfish to use the catapult launch rail, limited their bomb load to two bombs. Just before they closed on the convoy a Swordfish attacked a surfaced U-boat. The two bombs caused no damage to the submarine which returned fire, damaging the plane and wounding the air observer. Their relief shadowed the submarine until it dived when it carried out another unsuccessful attack. At 13:45, &quot;Biter&quot; closed with the convoy and commenced anti-submarine patrols. The convoy reached Britain on 16 May without any loss, and &quot;Biter&quot; was ordered to the Clyde. As a result of &quot;Biter&quot;′s experiences on these early convoys, the complement of aircraft carried was increased to 15 bombers and six fighters, with a 50% increase in air crews. Homing beacons were to be fitted to all carriers together with a Type 237 blind approach beam system for use in poor visibility.

===Convoy HX 265===
On 19 October 1943, &quot;Biter&quot; with six Swordfish and six Martlets of No. 811 Naval Air Squadron on board left the Clyde to join the westbound convoy ON 207 which arrived at Argentia untroubled on 5 November. They left Argentia on 7 November to support convoy HX 265. &quot;Biter&quot; was the lead ship in the 5th Support Group, with the destroyers , &quot;Opportune&quot; and &quot;Obdurate&quot;. They, together with the 7th Escort Group, were tasked to sail and respectively ahead of the convoy. The intention was they would detect the two large concentrations of U-boats, that were known to be waiting for the next eastbound convoy. Aircraft from &quot;Biter&quot; made several U-boat sightings but did not sink any; one was reported as probably being damaged on 10 November. On 16 November a Swordfish coming in to land crashed into the sea behind &quot;Biter&quot;. The force of the crash released the plane&#x27;s homing torpedo which detonated on the carrier&#x27;s rudder. The explosion damaged the steering, rudder assembly and some hull plates below the waterline. Once she reached Britain, it took four weeks to repair the damage.

==French service==
&quot;Biter&quot; was returned to the US Navy on 9 April 1945. She underwent a refit and was lent to the French Navy, where she was renamed Dixmude. The Flotille 3FB equipped with Douglas Dauntless dive bombers served on the ship between 1945 and 1949 during several campaigns in French Indochina. On 24 January 1951 she was removed from the US Navy register and disarmed during her next refit between 1951–1953. She then became an accommodation ship until 1965, when she was returned to the US Navy, who sank her as a target ship on June 16, 1966, in a 6th Fleet exercise, Exercise Deep Six.

<text>Frosinone (; local dialect: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Italian region of Lazio, administrative seat of the province of Frosinone. It is about southeast of Rome, close to the Rome-Naples A1 Motorway. The city is the main city of the Valle Latina (&quot;Latin Valley&quot;), an Italian geographical and historical region that extends from south of Rome to Cassino.

Until the 19th century, it was a village with a rural vocation, while from the 20th century, it became an important industrial and commercial centre. Traditionally considered a Volscian city, with the name of &quot;Frusna&quot; and then the Roman of Latium adiectum as &quot;Frùsino&quot;, over the course of its millenary history it has been subjected to multiple devastations and plunders caused by its geostrategic position; as a consequence of this, as well as of destruction due to seismic events (the most ruinous of which occurred in September 1349), it retains only rare, albeit significant, traces of its past.

==Etymology==

&quot;Frusĭno&quot; (this is the Latin name) was at the time inhabited by the people of the Volsci, albeit included in the territory of the Hernici. The Volscian name of the city would be &quot;Frusna&quot; or &quot;Fruscìno&quot;, whose etymology is controversial; however, various hypotheses have been tried: the first would make the name derive from the Greek root (&quot;portis&quot;: heifer); a second, observing the assonance with Etruscan roots, links the name to a hypothetical Etruscan gens &quot;Fursina&quot; (or alternatively, &quot;Frusina&quot; or &quot;Prusina&quot;). 

These have been accompanied by a more recent hypothesis, which, based on the links between the pre-Roman Italic civilizations, and in particular the Etruscan one, with the Akkadian-Sumerian peoples, posits similar influences also for toponyms: according to this, &quot;Frusna&quot; would have the meaning of &quot;Land sprinkled by rivers&quot;.

==History==

===Ancient age===
The first traces of human presence around modern Frosinone date from the Lower Paleolithic (around 250,000 years ago). The earliest settlements in the area are from around 4,000 years ago, including late Bronze Age remains in what is now the upper part of the city (12th–10th century BC) and 7th–6th century BC sepultures. 21 tombs from a Volscan necropolis were found in the Frosinone centre.

The city was founded in the territory of Hernicians by the Volsci in the 6th century BC with the name of &quot;Fruscìno&quot; or &quot;Frusna&quot;, as a strategic outpost in front of the impregnable fortress of Aletrium (today known as Alatri).

It was subjugated by the Romans in 386 BC during their advance against the Volsci in Valle del Sacco, then transformed into a &quot;municipium&quot; under the Roman garrison. The taking of the urban centre of Frosinone, which then as today is located in the centre of the Sacco Valley, determined an important strategic victory for the Romans, who with this city could easily control all transits and commercial traffic between the north and the south of the peninsula.

In 306 BC, the city took part in the Hernic League against Rome; defeated and sacked, it lost much of its territories to the nearby Ferentino. Later, during the Second Punic War, it was devastated by Hannibal&#x27;s armies, to which it refused to surrender. This event earned it the appellative, given by Silio Italico, of &quot;Bellator Frusino&quot;, which still stands out in the city coat of arms: .

Silio Italico also praises Frusino during the listing of the Roman allies in the Battle of Canne (&quot;a duro Frusino haud imbellis aratro&quot;, VIII, p. 398). Even Greek writers cited it in their writings, while among the Romans, later, Decimo Giunio Giovenale highlighted the tranquillity of the city.

Many ancient writers, including Tito Livio, Cassio Dione, Silio Italico, Festo Pomponio, Floro, the aforementioned Juvenal, and Marco Tullio Cicerone (Cicero) note the city of &quot;Frusino&quot; not only for mere historical facts, but also for the virtues of its inhabitants. Cicero himself in the territory of Frosinone owned a villa or a property, as it is possible to guess from a letter sent to his friend Atticus.

Despite the political and military troubles, &quot;Frusino&quot; was a prefecture and a municipality with all the rights that Roman citizenship entailed. The city obtained citizenship rights and became a colony in Roman imperial times, when part of its lands was assigned to Roman legionaries. As some historians report, the walls were built to defend the city. It was embellished with buildings, monuments and statues, which wars, the passing of time, and the neglect or foolishness of men have ruined, although in recent decades numerous artefacts have been found preserved in various museums, for example, the famous statue of Mars located in Rome, at Villa Albani, which was found in 1744 in the area that is still called &quot;Colle Marte&quot; today.

The sources are obscure on the spread of Christianity in Frosinone, but it is believed that an ancient diocese existed; the city was the birthplace of two popes, Pope Ormisda and Pope Silverio (the only case of two popes father and son), today patrons of the city.

===Medieval age===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Frosinone was destroyed several times by foreign invaders; in the early Middle Ages it was an agricultural centre of the Duchy of Rome. In the 13th century, it became the capital of a duchy assigned to the Gaetani, and from that century it was occasionally the seat of the rector of Campagna and Marittima, together with other cities of the papal province such as Ferentino, Anagni and Priverno. In 1350, it was damaged by an earthquake.

At the beginning of the 14th century, the city was dominated by the nearby and powerful Alatri, in turn, conquered by Francesco de Ceccano and his Ceccanesi troops for thirty years.

===Modern age===
In the 16th century it was devastated by the Landsknecht, who brought the plague there, immediately followed by French and Florentine troops, at the same time as the Sack of Rome. The fortress, destroyed, was rebuilt; whose main entrance portal would have been designed by Michelangelo.

New destruction occurred with the occupation by the Spanish troops at war against Pope Paul IV in 1556: its fortress was strategically important for the control of the whole Sacco valley and for the defence of Rome. Following the treaty of Cave (1557) the residence of the pontifical governors of the province of Campagna and Marittima was definitively fixed in Frosinone; the Campagna e Marittima will then take the name of the Apostolic Delegation of Frosinone.

Frosinone steadily expanded its population in modern times, passing from around 2,000 people in the mid-17th century to the over 10,000 it had at the Unification of Italy (late 19th century). At the same time a new architectural and urban development began, with the construction or renovation of monuments and places of worship, and in the nineteenth century the construction of new important roads, on all the Via Nova (current Corso della Repubblica) and Viale Roma, new access to the city. 
Worthy of note was the attitude of the Frosinone population during the French occupation and the Roman Republic, to which two Frosinone people, Giuseppe De Matthaeis and Luigi Angeloni, who became Tribunes of the Republic adhered: the population, around 1798, rebelled against the French troops and for this reason, the city was put to fire and sword and sacked (the anti-French revolt still echoes today through the Festa della Radeca, the Frosinone Carnival).

===Contemporary age===
On the occasion of the journey of Pius IX in the province of Campagna and Marittima (13–20 May 1863) by train, solemn celebrations were organized, which ended with the blessing of the pope from the balcony of the Prefecture. During this visit, the pope promised extraordinary funding for the construction of an aqueduct intended to bring running water to the city by means of a hydraulic pump, an aqueduct completed and inaugurated on December 8, 1869.
Frosinone witnessed in 1867 the Agro Romano Campaign for the liberation of Rome with the Nicotera Column. The clash with the Garibaldini in Monte San Giovanni Campano, on the border with the Kingdom of Italy, is noteworthy. The relics of the &quot;Nicola Ricciotti&quot; Carbonara Sale, a patriot of Frosinone, are kept in the National Museum of Mentana.

Frosinone was removed from the Papal State and officially annexed to the Kingdom of Italy on September 17, 1870, three days before Porta Pia. In reality, the secular papal dominion over the city had in fact already ended on the evening of 12 September with the escape of the last apostolic delegate, Monsignor Pietro Lasagni, while the Italian troops were still along the Casilina, in the territory of Ripi, in waiting to resume the march towards Frosinone.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, the inhabited area of the city was almost entirely enclosed within the ancient walls of the medieval &quot;citadel&quot;, as it had been rebuilt several times after the various devastations suffered by German and Spanish armies in the 16th century and by the French at the end of the 18th century. According to the description of the local historian Vittorio Valle, the citadel &quot;was bounded by a wall that had three cornerstones, the Porta Romana or della Valle, the Porta di Campania or Napoletana (today Porta Campagiorni) and the Rocca, now the venue of the Prefecture.&quot;

After national unification, the city, which became the capital of the district of Frosinone in the province of Rome, underwent a building renovation and architectural embellishment of the town, as evidenced by the late nineteenth-century and Umbertine buildings of the current historic centre. The city became the seat of the offices of the sub-prefecture and the military district; from 1863 it was served by the state railway station, to which the local railway station (the Rome-Fiuggi-Alatri-Frosinone railway) was added.

In 1871 Domenico Diamanti became the first mayor of the city after the unification of Italy; he actively engaged in the modernization and rehabilitation of the city, then known as one of the most backward in Italy. He took care of the building renovation, the arrangement of the streets, the squares and the lighting of the urban centre. In 1874 a row of buildings of over 300 meters was built, known as the &quot;Berardi palace&quot;, intended to meet the housing needs of the newborn State for employees and soldiers. At the centre of the structure rose the Isabella Theater, which was later called Politeama and then Cinema-Teatro Excelsior, still present today although inactive.

In June 1873 Urbano Rattazzi, then President of the Council of Ministers, died suddenly in Frosinone while he was staying with a friend. For that occasion, numerous politicians and officials of the King arrived in the city. The villa where Rattazzi died, Casale Ricci in via Armando Fabi, is now completely abandoned.

At the time of the First World War, Frosinone had about 12,000 inhabitants, scattered throughout the countryside in hamlets, small villages, or scattered houses, mainly devoted to agriculture. A smaller part of the inhabitants resided in the historic centre employed in the various offices of the sub-prefecture, the Municipality and other administrations including the Military District. There was also a fair amount of artisanal and commercial activity. On the other hand, industrial activity was more modest, with the presence of mills along the river Cosa, pasta factories and printers.

Frosinone remained the seat of the sub-prefecture from 1871 to 1926. In 1927, as part of a general administrative reorganization, the province of Frosinone was established by the fascist regime, subtracting municipalities from the provinces of Rome and Terra di Lavoro. The existing offices were expanded and new ones were created and a large number of state employees were transferred to the city, especially from Caserta.

Frosinone, therefore, experienced a new demographic, economic and social development. In this period, numerous new public buildings were also built, including the Palace of the Province and that of the Chamber of Commerce. In 1924 the Monument to the Fallen of the First World War was inaugurated in the presence of King Vittorio Emanuele III, the work of the architect Cesare Bazzani.

===Frosinone during the Second World War===
The latest destruction would be inflicted on the city during the Second World War, with 56 Anglo-American bombings which lasted from 11 September 1943 to the end of May 1944. During that unfortunate period, all public offices were temporarily moved a little further up north, to Fiuggi, which enjoyed relative tranquillity. It was 31 May 1944 when the first Allied soldiers entered Frosinone (Canadian soldiers belonging to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment), who sent a message to the command: &quot;The city is empty and in ruins!&quot;

The bombings razed 80% of the city to the ground, including the Church of the Annunziata, the Berardi Palace, the Town Hall, the entire medieval village which was developed in the area of Via Cavour, the barracks of the R.R. Carabinieri, the final stretch of Via Vittorio Emanuele II, now Corso della Repubblica. Significant damage was reported at the Apostolic Palace, now the seat of the Prefecture, at the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, at the seat of the &quot;N.Turriziani&quot; Liceo Classico and at the Church of Santa Lucia. Downstream, the railway station and the Sanctuary of the Madonna delle Nevi were destroyed.

The bell tower, a symbol of the city and on which a siren had been placed to warn citizens in case of enemy air raids, reported a large circular hole on one of the clocks.

Furthermore, the monument to the fallen of the Great War located in Piazza Armando Diaz, of which only the pedestal remained, was completely lost. This was then reused for the new monument to the fallen, of all wars, in Frosinone, built by Umberto Mastroianni at the end of the seventies and which is now located in one of the &quot;corners&quot; of Viale Mazzini.

At the end of the war, Frosinone was the most devastated provincial capital in relation to the number of inhabitants and the building stock. A census of the following year recorded 3,050 rooms completely destroyed, 4,880 badly damaged, 8,500 people were left homeless, practically all the inhabitants of the upper part of Frosinone. Hundreds were dead and wounded. But despite the extreme suffering and devastation, the municipality would only receive a bronze medal for Civil Valor.

===From the postwar period to today===
The reconstruction provided an opportunity to transform the production system, which transitioned from mainly agricultural to mainly industrial, and then to a mainly tertiary economy (including activities such as trade, services and public administration).

Specifically, between 1950 and 1960, Frosinone saw a continuation of the trends it had seen in the immediate postwar period: a steady decline in the agricultural sector (to 9% of employed residents), a modest increase in industry (to 36%) and a significant rise in tertiary activities, in which 54% of the workforce is engaged. 

The reconstruction work continues, including: renovations to important buildings (such as the sites of the Prefecture, the Bank of Italy, the halls of Justice, the Chamber of Commerce and the Post and Telecommunications); new construction (such as the Civil Hospital, public housing and the Edera skyscraper); the expansion of the urban and extra-urban road network; and providing public water connections to nearby rural settlements.

It was within this general framework that the industrialization process began. In 1962, the Industrialization Unit of the Sacco Valley was established and the Rome-Naples motorway section was constructed. The motorway artery, which crosses the entire valley longitudinally, was hugely important in ending the isolation of the capital and of the entire province. Previously the region had only the ancient Via Casilina and less functional roadways for inter-regional connections, and the Rome-Naples railway had not yet been electrified.

The following decades saw economic development, but also periods of crisis. This led, especially in the &quot;lower&quot; Frosinone, to the development of an industrial and commercial centre that was predominantly modern, but suffered from a disordered and irrational approach to urban development, caused by a failure to implement the zoning plan and a tendency to engage in building speculation – this tendency has been increasing since the 1960s and continues today, even though the population stopped growing many years ago.

==Geography==
Frosinone is in Latium and is the main city of the Valle Latina (&quot;Latin Valley&quot;). The town is surrounded by the Ernici and Lepini mountain ranges. 

==Climate==
==Cityscape==
===Religious architectures===
=== Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta ===
The Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta is the most important church in Frosinone and is located on the highest point of the hill on which the historic center of the city stands (Upper Frosinone). It was extensively remodeled in the 18th century, referring to Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle in Rome. 
It features a bell tower (Il Campanile), 68 meters high, which is considered the most emblematic monument of the city, with three rows of mullioned windows. The facade of the cathedral is in white marble.

Among the works of art preserved in the sacred place there is a &quot;Madonna with Sant&#x27;Anna, San Giovannino and angels&quot; by Sementi. The church has been a Cathedral since 1986, the year the diocese was established.

==== Chiesa abbaziale di San Benedetto ====
Built in 1134, the abbey church of San Benedetto which is also the oldest art gallery in the city, was rebuilt between 1750 and 1797 in late Baroque style, with an octagonal lantern and a facade with two superimposed orders. remained unscathed from war destruction, it preserves inside valuable canvases dated between the seventeenth century and the nineteenth century.

The interior of the church has a single nave, with intercommunicating side chapels, covered with a ribbed barrel vault, stuccoed and lunette at each window.

Inside the church there is the painting of the &quot;Madonna del Buon Consiglio&quot; by an unknown local artist, to which a miracle is linked that would have occurred on 10 July 1796: while some women were gathered for the rosary in front of the painting &quot;the Madonna opened her eyes and looked at the faithful, then her face became vermilion.Sometimes the left eye that looked at the Child was veiled with tears&quot;.

Among the other canvases present, the one dedicated to San Gregorio Magno stands out, made by the local painter Mascetti in 1899, copying a fresco by the painter Filippo Gagliardi. The altar, adorned with Baroque stuccoes, is dedicated to the Kambo family. Under the altar the remains of a martyr of Christianity are kept and visible.

Going up the small bell tower you can admire two bells of the ancient eighteenth-century Cacciavillani factory and the bell, also eighteenth-century, of the ancient municipal seat, now a post office with the ancient coat of arms of the city of Frosinone.

==== Sanctuary of the Madonna della Neve ====
The sanctuary of the Madonna della Neve was built as a rural chapel at the end of the seventeenth century in the place of a miraculous event, which took place on May 10, 1675, and known as the &quot;Sweating of the Madonna&quot; which would have occurred in the already existing church dating back to 1586. In just over a year the church was completed in all its parts, including the sacristy and bell tower, and all the sacred furnishings were provided.

On 8 May 1678, the fourth Sunday after Easter, she was solemnly consecrated. The Sanctuary later hosted a community of religious. When the prodigy of sweating occurred in 1675, the very young Cardinal Francesco Orsini, future Pope Benedict XIII, at the time archbishop of Benevento, also intervened among the illustrious pilgrims who came to venerate the image assisted. In 1727, now elected Pope, he wanted to return to Frosinone on the eve of the Ascension to venerate the Madonna della Neve, still today there is a plaque commemorating her visit. Pius IX also visited the Sanctuary on May 14, 1863, and also in this circumstance the feast of the Ascension took place.

In the church, a 16th century fresco depicts the &quot;Madonna della Neve with saints Ormisda and Silverio&quot;. Then there is an altarpiece by Filippo Balbi depicting the &quot;Madonna della Cintura&quot;.

The original church was sacked several times in the course of history and also suffered serious damage during the air raids to the point of being demolished and rebuilt in the fifties.

==== Church of San Magno or of the Madonna della Delibera ====
The Church of San Magno, or of the Madonna della Delibera, dates back to the 9th century, but its current appearance is partly due to the restoration in 1747. With an octagonal plan, inside it houses frescoes depicting the Virgin Mary, the Child and Saint Magno adoring, Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Biagio, Saint Bernardino of Siena and Saint Luigi Gonzaga.

Noteworthy is the frescoed altarpiece depicting Saint Magno with Saint Ormisda. Between the two saints, the unknown author of the work depicted the city of Frosinone, with the Rocca and the towers present at the time.

==== Church of the Santissima Annunziata ====
The Church of the Santissima Annunziata, seat since 1785 of one of the parishes of the city, was destroyed by the bombings of the Second World War, and therefore rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1984 it suffered extensive damage following an earthquake, returning usable only in 2000.

==== Church of Santa Lucia ====
A church with this name was built in the 16th century at the behest of Bishop Ennio Filonardi, for the burial of those sentenced to death, in the place where the Bank of Italy building would later rise. In 1840 it was rebuilt on the current Corso della Repubblica in neoclassical forms. Fallen into poverty at the end of the nineteenth century, it survived the bombings of 1943, when it is estimated that 95% of the buildings in that area had been destroyed.

==== Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie or San Gerardo ====
The church of Santa Maria delle Grazie was erected during the eighteenth century at the behest of the bishops of Veroli De Zaulis and De Tartagnis in the place where there was a small cone of the same name and the church of San Lorenzo. The church, with a single nave, has various side chapels and a precious 14th century fresco, placed behind the central altar, depicting the Madonna nursing the Child, a typical image of popular devotion as well as the only fragment of the ancient building of San Lorenzo.

In June 1776 the custody of the church was entrusted to the Redemptorist fathers and the devotion to San Gerardo Maiella was associated with the cult of the Madonna delle Grazie. The feast of the saint, the last Sunday of September, attracts thousands of faithful every year. San Clemente Maria Hofbauer lived for some time in the annexed religious house founded by Sant&#x27;Alfonso and celebrated his first Holy Mass in this church.

It is still officiated today by the Redemptorist fathers who have their own home in this sanctuary.

=== Civil architectures ===
==== Government Palace ====
Located in the place where the medieval fortress of Frosinone stood, the building currently the seat of the prefecture of Frosinone was built starting from 1825 as the seat of the Apostolic Delegation of Frosinone on a project by the architect Mazzarini and the works, carried out by the architect Antonio Sarti, ended in 1840. Of the fortress he kept the portal, the design of which was attributed by oral tradition to Michelangelo.

The building was damaged by the Marsica earthquake of 1915, by a fire in 1927 and above all by the bombings of the Second World War.

After the war it acquired its current appearance, essentially maintaining the overall structure, with four floors and a central loggia at the height of the noble floor supported by six Doric columns, but deprived of the clock tower that crowned it. Inside there are furnishings from the Royal Palace of Caserta.

==== Palazzo della Provincia ====
The building, seat of the provincial administration of Frosinone, was built between 1930 and 1933 in the neoclassical style – but with a reinforced concrete structure – based on a project by the architect Giovanni Jacobucci. According to the intentions, the inauguration of the Palace should have taken place on October 28, 1932, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the march on Rome, but the works were completed the following year.

In the atrium of the building there is the bronze statue of the &quot;Dancer&quot;: this early twentieth century work by Amleto Cataldi – a sculptor originally from Roccasecca and Castrocielo whose production mainly developed in Rome – has been brought back to Italy from the United States, where it had been since the 1920s, In 2010. Auguste Rodin was able to admire the sculpture in an exhibition in Paris and underlined &quot;the rhythmic harmony and active silence&quot;.

From the atrium, a monumental staircase leads to the upper floors and the reception hall. The palace also houses works of art by Umberto Mastroianni, Renato Guttuso, Cavalier d&#x27;Arpino, Aldo Turkeyro and Giovanni Colacicchi.

==== Palazzo Pietro Tiravanti ====
This imposing building was built as the seat of elementary schools, based on a project by engineer Edgardo Vivoli, &quot;on the verdant spur of the Belvedere hill in view of the delightful plain&quot; and was dedicated to the gold medal Pietro Tiravanti, who fell in Libya during the First World War. Of classical architecture, it was one of the first buildings in Italy of this size to be built in anti-seismic reinforced concrete.

the work, conceived since 1871, was made possible thanks to the funding received following the Marsica earthquake of 1915: begun in January 1925, it saw its completion on June 15, 1929.

The building is spread over 4 floors in the side forepart and 3 floors in the central part, with 52 rooms, 14 corridors and 2 stairwells; due to its size, which makes it unmistakable in the city landscape, the Tiravanti is also known in the city as the &quot;Building&quot;. A conservative restoration project for the building, commissioned by the municipal administration, was financed by the Monte dei Paschi di Siena Foundation.

On 6 December 2014 it became the seat of the Frosinone Academy of Fine Arts, following a restoration funded by Banca Popolare del Cassinate. On 1 March 2015, the &quot;Maca&quot;, the Museum of Contemporary Art of the Academy of Fine Arts, opens inside.

==Archaeological sites==
=== Roman amphitheater ===
The ruins of a Roman amphitheater, built between the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the 2nd century, are at the foot of the hill on which the historic center of the city stands today, near the Cosa river. The hypothesis that there was an amphitheater in Frosinone had been formulated in the early nineteenth century by Giuseppe De Matthaeis, who in one of his historical essays dedicated to the city cites some medieval documents in which expressions such as &quot;&quot;juxta amphitheatrum Frusinonis&quot; and &quot;cum amphitheatrum&quot;&quot;, but the exact site was identified only in 1965, during the excavation sites for the construction of some buildings, which were eventually built on top of it anyway. The part of the Roman monument left visible between the pillars of the building above can be visited today. A reconstructive model of the monument is on display in the Archaeological Museum of Frosinone.
The building, with an elliptical plan, had the main entrances to the arena at the ends of its major axis of about 80 m, which is presumed to have had a single order of steps, eventually holding about 2000 spectators. In the vicinity of this archaeological site it is possible to visit the locality &quot;Ponte della Fontana&quot; where you can admire the ancient bridge and the fountain from which the name of the area derives. Next to the ancient bridge of the fountain there is a more modern bridge inaugurated in 1870, which still today provides access to one of the main roads leading to the upper part of the city.

==Notable people==
==Culture==

==Government==
===Twin towns===
* Elmwood Park (Illinois), since 1996: the twinning was born due to the strong presence of Ciociari immigrants in the American town.
* Tecumseh, since 2009: the initiative was born from the proclamation, by the Ciociaro Club of Windsor, of the city of Frosinone as &quot;Municipality of the Year 2009&quot;. Tecumseh, a town bordering Windsor, recognized the important role Italians played in their own development. In particular, it was recognized what was done by the Frosinone immigrants who have given, since their arrival, a strong contribution to the construction of the productive-economic apparatus, both in manufacturing and in agricultural production.
* Nocera Umbra, since 2009: the twinning was born following the tragic events of September 1997, when the city of Nocera Umbra was hit by the earthquake. A team of Fire Brigade from Frosinone brought first aid, in particular, in Colle di Nocera. Subsequently, the Colle Cottorino Committee of Frosinone, made contact with the Pro Loco of Nocera Umbra, decided to bring a small gift to each of the 110 children of the elementary schools of Colle di Nocera Umbra. Since then a close bond of friendship and solidarity has been established between the two communities and the initial twinning between the two hamlets has extended to the municipal level.
* Ponza, since 2010: the twinning was born from the common veneration for the patron saint.

<doc id="982630" wikidata="Q6750211" url="?curid=982630" title="1988 Manitoba general election">
<text>The 1988 Manitoba general election was held on April 26, 1988 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It resulted in a minority government. The Progressive Conservative Party won 25 seats, against 20 for the Liberal Party and 12 for the New Democratic Party.

==Background==
The election was called unexpectedly in early 1988, after disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding voted against his government&#x27;s budget on March 9, 1988. With former cabinet minister Laurent Desjardins having essentially abandoned his seat earlier in the year, the Legislative Assembly was almost evenly divided. Walding&#x27;s defection thus resulted in Howard Pawley&#x27;s NDP government being defeated, 28 votes to 27. As the budget vote was a confidence measure, the Pawley ministry was forced to resign and call new elections two years ahead of schedule.

Popular support for the NDP was at an historically low level when the election was called, due to soaring Autopac rates and a taxpayer-funded bailout of the Manitoba Telephone System. The Pawley government&#x27;s support for the Meech Lake Accord was also unpopular in some circles. One internal poll had the party at only 6% support, and there were concerns that they could be reduced to only two or three seats in the 57-seat legislature. Pawley resigned as party leader on the day after the budget defeat, and Urban Affairs Minister Gary Doer narrowly defeated Agriculture Minister Leonard Harapiak to replace him at a party convention held during the campaign.

Pawley himself announced he would enter federal politics and did not seek re-election in his own seat. In an unusual arrangement, the outgoing premier remained in office until after the election. Even after Doer&#x27;s selection, the consensus was that the NDP would not be reelected. However, they managed to stabilize at around 20% in the polls. Many traditional NDP voters, especially in the city of Winnipeg, abandoned the party to support the Liberals in this cycle.

==Issues==
The Progressive Conservatives, led by Gary Filmon, ran on a platform of saving revenue by selling public corporations, including ManOil and Manfor. Filmon also promised to scrap the province&#x27;s Public Investment Corporation entirely. The Liberals also promised more prudent fiscal management, but did not propose to sell these crown corporations. Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs was also known as a prominent opponent of the Meech Lake Accord.

The NDP, which retained a support base in the north of the province, promised to create northern training centres in Thompson and The Pas.

The national abortion debate also surfaced in this campaign, although none of the major parties put forward a clear position on the issue. Although Filmon was personally anti-abortion, the Progressive Conservatives were unwilling to propose specific action on the subject, and withdrew from an early promise to close Henry Morgentaler&#x27;s private clinic. The Liberals favoured counselling, including a focus on adoption. The NDP emphasized prevention and support services for poorer women who choose to continue their pregnancies.

==Campaign==
The Progressive Conservatives entered the election with a significant lead in the polls, but saw their support undercut by the Liberals in the campaign&#x27;s final weeks. Before the party leaders&#x27; debate, a &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; poll indicated that 40% of voters considered Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs as the best choice for Premier, with 24% favouring Progressive Conservative Gary Filmon and 19% favouring NDP leader Gary Doer. 17% were undecided.

Carstairs performed well in the leaders&#x27; debate, and did much to improve her party&#x27;s popularity as the campaign reached its end.

==Opinion polls==

==Results==
The Liberal Party performed well in Winnipeg, winning 19 out of 29 seats in that city and picking up ridings from both the NDP and Tories, and nearly managed to oust Filmon in his riding of Tuxedo, in south-central Winnipeg. The party won only one seat outside Winnipeg, however—Pawley&#x27;s former seat of Selkirk, centred on the community of the same name just north of Winnipeg. It was and still is the party&#x27;s best showing in an election since the then Liberal-Progressives won their last majority in 1953.

In terms of the popular vote, the Progressive Conservatives actually lost support from the last election, however they dominated the rural southern portion of the province, a traditional Tory stronghold. They made some inroads into traditional NDP territory immediately north of Winnipeg. The party also won six seats in Winnipeg, and took the northern seat of Swan River from the NDP.

The New Democrats managed to retain four seats in Winnipeg, five in the north, the mid-northern ridings of Dauphin and Interlake, and Brandon East in the south of the province. It is still the worst defeat that an NDP government has suffered in Manitoba.

Exit polls later revealed that new voters (i.e., immigrants and first-time voters) had polled strongly for the Liberals in Winnipeg.

Although Pawley had retired from politics and his party was reduced to third place, by constitutional convention he retained the right to remain in office until the NDP was defeated in the legislature, as well as the right to advise whether Lieutenant Governor George Johnson should appoint Filmon or Carstairs as the new premier upon leaving office. Doer also could have attempted to negotiate a coalition with the Liberals. Instead, he informally reached a deal with Filmon in which the NDP would tolerate a Tory minority government. As a result, Pawley finally resigned as Premier of Manitoba on May 9 and advised Johnson to appoint Filmon his successor. Filmon was duly sworn in later that day after advising Johnson that he could form a government.

1 &quot;Before&quot; refers to standings in the Legislature at dissolution, and not to the results of the previous election. These numbers therefore reflect changes in party standings as a result of by-elections and members crossing the floor.

<text>HMS &quot;Audacity was a British [[escort carrier]] of the [[Second World War]] and the first of her kind to serve in the [[Royal Navy]]. She was originally the German merchant ship Hannover, which the British captured in the [[West Indies]] in March 1940 and renamed Sinbad, then Empire Audacity. She was converted and commissioned asHMS &quot;Empire Audacity, then as HMS &quot;Audacity&quot;. She was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in late 1941.

==History==

===&quot;Hannover&quot;===

&quot;Hannover&quot; was a 5,537 GRT cargo liner built by Bremer Vulkan Schiff- und Maschinenbau, Vegesack and launched on 29 March 1939. She was owned by Norddeutscher Lloyd and plied between Germany and the West Indies on the banana run. &quot;Hannover&quot;″s port of registry was Bremen. When World War II began, &quot;Hannover&quot; sought refuge in Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles. In March 1940, &quot;Hannover&quot; attempted to return to Germany as a blockade runner. She was sighted between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on the night of 7/8 March by the light cruiser and the Canadian destroyer . &quot;Hannover&quot; was ordered to stop, but ignored the order and tried to reach the neutral waters of the Dominican Republic. When &quot;Dunedin&quot; and &quot;Assiniboine&quot; intercepted &quot;Hannover&quot;, Captain Wahnschaffe ordered the seacocks opened and the ship set on fire. A boarding party from &quot;Dunedin&quot; closed the sea cocks and &quot;Hannover&quot; was taken under tow. However, it took four days for the salvage crew to put out the fire. &quot;Hannover&quot; was then towed to Jamaica, arriving on 11 March. Acting Lieutenant A. W. Hughes of &quot;Dunedin&quot; was mentioned in despatches for his part in securing &quot;Hannover&quot;. Damage was mainly confined to her electrical system.

===&quot;Sinbad&quot;===
&quot;Hannover&quot; was renamed Sinbad, given a UK Official Number and assigned new Code Letters. Her port of registry was changed to Kingston, Jamaica, under the British flag. Her cargo included 29 barrels of pickled sheep pelts, which were offered for sale by tender in August 1940 as a result of being declared as prize.

===&quot;Empire Audacity&quot;===
&quot;Sinbad&quot; was renamed Empire Audacity as one of the Empire ships of the Ministry of War Transport and was commissioned as an &quot;Ocean Boarding Vessel&quot; on 11 November. Her port of registry was changed to London. She was placed under the management of Cunard White Star Line Ltd. On 22 January 1941, she was sent to Blyth Dry Docks &amp; Shipbuilding Co Ltd, Blyth to be rebuilt as an escort carrier. Britain did not have enough aircraft carriers and shipping was vulnerable to attacks by U-boats in the Mid-Atlantic Gap, where there was no air cover. The Admiralty decided that small carriers were part of the solution and had a number of merchantmen, including &quot;Empire Audacity&quot;, converted. &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; was the largest ship handled at Blyth, which was more used to ships of length. The townsfolk of Blyth wondered why the superstructure of a perfectly good ship was being scrapped at a time when Britain was desperately short of ships. &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; was commissioned on 17 June 1941. She was the Royal Navy&#x27;s first escort carrier.

===HMS &quot;Empire Audacity&quot;===
HMS &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; worked up in the Clyde. The first deck landing was by a Grumman Martlet of 802 Naval Air Squadron (FAA) on 10 July. A detachment of aircraft were based on &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; from 19 to 21 July. All her aircraft had to be stored on the flight deck, as the hasty conversion into an escort carrier did not include a hangar deck. The Admiralty disliked her merchant name, and HMS &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; was renamed HMS &quot;Audacity&quot; on 31 July 1941.

===HMS &quot;Audacity&quot;===
&quot;Audacity&quot; was put into full service, embarking eight Martlets of No. 802 Squadron FAA. The use of only fighters was a major departure from later practice, where the main component was anti-submarine patrol aircraft, but she was used to support Gibraltar convoys and the only perceived threat was the German long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor reconnaissance/bomber aircraft.

&quot;Audacity&quot; participated in four convoys during her short career.

;OG 74
Convoy OG 74 sailed from Britain on 13 September 1941. A week later on 21 September the convoy was attacked by a German Condor bomber, whose bombs struck the convoy rescue ship . A fighter from &quot;Audacity&quot; was able to shoot down the bomber. The damage to &quot;Walmer Castle&quot; was extensive, and she had to be sunk by an escorting corvette.

;HG 74
Convoy HG 74 sailed from Gibraltar on 2 October and arrived at the Clyde on 17 October. The trip was uneventful.

;OG 76
Convoy OG 76 sailed on 28 October bound for Gibraltar. During the voyage, Martlets from &quot;Audacity&quot; shot down four Condors, one being the first aerial victory for Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown. One Martlet was lost.

;HG 76
Convoy HG 76 sailed from Gibraltar on 14 December. &quot;Audacity&quot; had only four Martlet aircraft serviceable. The convoy came under attack from 12 U-boats. Martlets from &quot;Audacity&quot; shot down two Condors; was attacked on 17 December. &quot;U-131&quot; shot down a Martlet, but was unable to dive after the attack, and was scuttled by her crew, who were taken prisoner.

As &quot;Audacity&quot; left the convoy on the night of 21 December, one of the merchantmen fired a &quot;snowflake&quot; flare which revealed her in silhouette to the German U-boats. The submarines had been given specific orders to sink her as she had caused a lot of trouble for the Germans both at sea and in the air. The first torpedo fired by under &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Gerhard Bigalk hit her in the engine room and she began to settle by the stern. The next two torpedoes caused an explosion of the aviation fuel blowing off her bow. &quot;Audacity&quot; sank some west of Cape Finisterre at . She sank in 70 minutes. 73 of her crew were killed. Her survivors were picked up by the corvettes , and , one of the survivors being pilot Eric Brown. The German commander had confused her with a , the sinking of which was announced by Nazi propaganda sources.
&quot;Audacity&quot; had been operating outside the convoy, a procedure that was later prohibited by the Admiralty as too risky.

==Official number and code letters==
Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. &quot;Sinbad&quot; and &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; had the UK Official Number 156145. &quot;Hannover&quot; used the Code Letters DOBV. &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; used the Code Letters GLXZ.

==Model==

A model of HMS &quot;Audacity&quot; is displayed in the Merseyside Maritime Museum.

<doc id="982656" wikidata="Q7559966" url="?curid=982656" title="Somerville Community Path">
<text>The Somerville Community Path is a paved rail trail in Somerville, Massachusetts, running from the Alewife Linear Park at the Cambridge/Somerville border to East Cambridge via Davis Square. The first portion opened in 1985 along part of the former Fitchburg Cutoff rail line. Extensions opened in 1994 and 2015. A further extension to East Cambridge opened in June 2023 as part of the Green Line Extension project. It is a section of the partially completed Mass Central Rail Trail.

==History==

The east part of the Fitchburg Cutoff opened in 1870, connecting the Lexington and Arlington Railroad (Lexington Branch) to the Boston and Lowell Railroad. Only used for Boston and Maine Railroad freight trains after 1926, the line was abandoned as far east as Cedar Street in 1979 to allow construction of the Red Line Northwest Extension. The Alewife Linear Park opened from to in 1985. The Somerville Community Path opened from Davis Square to Cedar Street in 1994, with the Cambridge/Somerville border–Davis Square segment of the Alewife Linear Park becoming part of the Community Path. In 2013, construction began on a extension to Lowell Street. The $2.2 million extension opened in mid-2015, with an official dedication ceremony on August 19.

In April 2014, state officials announced that a , $39 million extension of the Community Path to East Cambridge would be built as part of the Green Line Extension (GLX) project. Beginning in 2015, the state began a major re-evaluation of the GLX project due to significantly increased costs. In May 2016, the state indicated that the Community Path would only be built as far as Washington Street in the revised plan to avoid a costly bridge. In some sections, the path would be lowered to track level to eliminate costly retaining walls, resulting in fewer connections to cross streets than previously planned.
A consortium called GLX Constructors was selected as the winner for re-bid project in November 2017. Their proposal reduced costs enough to add the full Community Path extension back into the plan. However, the plans call for a -wide path, narrower than existing portions and the 12-foot width recommended in federal guidelines. Cycling advocates have raised concerns about safety of the narrowed path given the expected levels of bicycle traffic. The GLX and path extension were expected to be completed in late 2021; with was delayed to mid-2022, then November 2022. The -long bridge over the Fitchburg Line and Green Line reaches tall, with grades of 4.8% on the approaches.

The Medford Branch opened in December 2022, but the path remained closed. Somerville signed a lease agreement with the MBTA in February 2023. The extension opened on June 10, 2023. A separate project constructing Reavis Field for Somerville High School moved a small section of the path onto a protected on-street detour until October 18, 2023. The path extension is an example of rails with trails.

Two proposed projects would connect to the extension: the Mystic to Charles Connector north to the Mystic Greenways network, and the Grand Junction Multi-use Path south to the Charles River Bike Path.

<text>Carlene Denise Moore-Begnaud (born August 27, 1972) is a retired American professional wrestler and manager, better known by her ring name Jazz. She is best known for her time at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) where she was a two-time WWF/WWE Women&#x27;s Champion. She has also competed for the National Wrestling Alliance, where she held the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship for over 900 days. She&#x27;s a producer and the head of women&#x27;s division for NWA.

She is also known for her tenure in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and Impact Wrestling, where she retired from in-ring competition.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early Career (1998-1999) ===
Made her debut in wrestling in 1998 working for independent promotions in Kansas and Texas. 

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999–2000) ===
After dropping out of college, Begnaud was approached about starting a career as a professional wrestler and joined a wrestling school in Louisiana. She was originally inspired to be a wrestler when she saw Jacqueline Moore perform. Begnaud trained with Rod Price for six to eight months, and she later made her professional wrestling debut in a match against Moore.

Using the name Jazzmine, she later joined Extreme Championship Wrestling as a part of an alliance called the Impact Players, which included wrestlers such as Jason Knight, Lance Storm, and Justin Credible. She later began a feud with Jason and defeated him at Heat Wave in 1999. She appeared on an intermittent basis before leaving the company before ECW was shut down due to bankruptcy.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001-2004)===

==== Training and Debut (2001) ====

In late 2001, the World Wrestling Federation expressed interest in Begnaud, and she was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for six months to train. Under the new ring name Jazz, she signed a two-year contract with WWF. She made her debut in the company as a heel on the Survivor Series pay-per-view during a Six-Pack Challenge match for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, which had been vacated by Chyna after her departure from the company. Ultimately, Trish Stratus was the winner for the match and the championship.

==== Women&#x27;s Champion (2002) ====
Following her debut in the company, Jazz began her first rivalry with then-Women&#x27;s Champion Trish Stratus as on the January 14, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jazz received a push as she defeated Jacqueline to become the number one contender to Stratus&#x27; Women&#x27;s title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 14/1/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz received her championship match against Trish at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, where she was unsuccessful in capturing the title, however, on the February 4, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jazz defeated Stratus to win the Women&#x27;s Championship for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 4/2/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, at WrestleMania X8, Jazz successfully defended her title against Lita and Trish Stratus in a triple–threat match.

On May 6, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment, subsequently renaming the title to the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, as a result, Jazz became the last woman to hold the Women&#x27;s title under the WWF banner and the first to hold it under the WWE banner. On the April 29, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jazz challenged Bubba Ray Dudley for the Hardcore Championship, although didn&#x27;t win the championship, she successfully helped Stevie Richards to capture it. On the May 6, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jazz was helped by Richards to retain her title against Trish Stratus, after knocking her with a superkick, after the match, Bubba Ray attacked both Steven and Jazz to try regain his title although multiple superstars started competing for it changing simultaneously from holders like Raven, Justin Credible, Crash, Trish Stratus and finally regained to Richard after being helped by Jazz,&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 5/6/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to a torn ACL in her knee, Jazz dropped her title to Stratus in a hardcore-Rules match the following week on the May 13, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Post-match, she was attacked by both Bubba Ray and Stratus as he performed an &quot;aided superbomb&quot; through a table on her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 5/13/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feud with Victoria and Trish Stratus (2003–2004) ====

Jazz made her return on the January 27, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, viciously attacking Trish Stratus after a Chicago Street Fight for Victoria&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Championship, in which Stratus was defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 1/27/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She made her return in–ring action on the February 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Molly Holly in a singles match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 2/10/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz involved herself in the feud between Stratus and Victoria upon her return. She immediately took out Stratus and dominated in matches against Molly Holly and Jacqueline. She competed in a triple threat match for the Women&#x27;s Championship at WrestleMania XIX against Stratus and Victoria, but Stratus walked away with the title. During this time, she took on the managerial services of Theodore Long, which led to another Women&#x27;s Championship reign after defeating Stratus at Backlash. She had another successful title defence at Judgment Day in a Fatal Four-Way Match involving Stratus, Victoria and Jacqueline. However, she lost the title in a battle royal to Gail Kim on June 30. During the match, Jazz had sustained a chipped and dislocated shoulder and needed several weeks to rehabilitate. She returned from injury in early 2004, but was used sparingly. Later that year, she became manager and valet for her real-life husband Rodney Mack. She was released from WWE in November 2004 due to the creative department&#x27;s lack of ideas for her character.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2006) ===
From January 16, 2005, she started working on the independent circuit and appeared at the unofficial ECW reunion show, Hardcore Homecoming. In late 2005, Jazz and Rodney Mack opened Dirtysouth Championship Wrestling, an independent promotion based in Louisiana. Jazz also performed in Women&#x27;s Extreme Wrestling, where she won the company&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship in May 2005 in a &quot;Fatal Four M&#x27;enage Quatro match&quot; against Angel Orsini, Mercedes Martinez, and Simply Luscious when the previous champion, Tai &quot;Killer Weed&quot;, was forced to relinquish the title due to an injury. While still WEW champion, on June 24, 2005, Jazz defeated April Hunter to win the NWA Cyberspace Women&#x27;s Championship.

In 2006, Jazz and Mack renamed DCW to Downsouth Championship Wrestling. Soon after the promotion&#x27;s name change, Jazz won her promotion&#x27;s Louisiana State Championship. Later that month on June 24, she participated in ChickFight V and debuted in All Pro Wrestling.

=== WWE brief return (2006) ===
In 2006, Begnaud was one of several Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni to be returning to WWE for a limited amount of time. Jazz made her first appearance in WWE since 2004 as part of the new ECW during the WWE vs. ECW Head-to-Head show on June 7, where she faced then-Women&#x27;s Champion Mickie James in a losing effort. Jazz, however, did not continue an on-screen role in the brand and only made a few appearances at ECW house shows, attacking the likes of Kelly Kelly and Francine, marking her last appearances with WWE. On January 18, 2007, Jazz was again released by WWE.

=== Women Superstars Uncensored (2007–2011) ===
In May 2007, Jazz and Rodney Mack were booked by the Queens of Chaos promotion in France. In late 2009, Jazz debuted for Women Superstars Uncensored in New Jersey, defeating Angel Orsini. On March 6, 2010, at the Third Year Anniversary show, Jazz was inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame along with Dawn Marie and Molly Holly. At the same event, Jazz unsuccessfully challenged Amber O&#x27;Neal to become the No.1 contender for the WSU Championship. She continued to compete with the company and with National Wrestling Superstars, where she teamed with former ECW star Balls Mahoney in a tournament. In 2010, Jazz won WSU&#x27;s third Uncensored Rumble to earn a shot at Mercedes Martinez&#x27;s WSU Championship. Mercedes defeated Jazz in the main event of WSU&#x27;s inaugural internet pay-per-view, &quot;Breaking Barriers&quot;, on November 5, 2010. Jazz was defeated by Alicia at WSU&#x27;s four year anniversary show on March 5, 2011. However, later that same night, she offered herself as the mystery partner of WSU Tag Team Champion Marti Belle, whose partner, Tina San Antonio, was injured in the week prior. Marti Belle and Jazz defeated Amy Lee and Cindy Rogers and The Soul Sisters (Jana and Latasha) to become the &quot;new&quot; WSU Tag Team Champions, giving Jazz her first Tag Team Championships. Jazz, Belle, and Tina would be able to defend the belts under the &quot;Freebird rule&quot; where any two of the three could compete. Marti and Tina would lose the belts before Jazz was able to have a defense. Jazz was scheduled for a rematch but had to pull out for personal reasons.

=== Shine Wrestling (2012–2013; 2014) ===
On July 21, 2012, Jazz took part at the inaugural Shine Wrestling event &quot;Shine 1&quot; where she was awarded the Legacy Award from Diva Dirt, a women&#x27;s wrestling website. During receiving the award, Jazz was interrupted by Mercedes Martinez. At the event, Jazz defeated Sara Del Rey in the main event. Following the events of &quot;Shine 1&quot;, Jazz faced Martinez on August 17 in the main event of &quot;Shine 2&quot;, which ended in no–contest. After defeating Rain on September 21 at &quot;Shine 3&quot;, it was announced that Jazz will challenge the then-Shimmer Champion Saraya Knight for the title at &quot;Shine 4&quot;. On October 19, at &quot;Shine 4&quot;, Jazz suffered her first lost at Shine against Knight, after an interference from Martinez and Rain. On November 16, at &quot;Shine 5&quot;, Jazz teamed with Amazing Kong, where they defeated Martinez and Rain at the main event, ending Jazz feud with Martinez and Rain in the process.

On April 19, 2013, at &quot;Shine 9&quot;, Jazz defeated Ivelisse in a Shine Championship tournament qualifying match, however, Jazz never entered the tournament for undisclosed reasons, as this match was her last appearance on Shine. On April 4, 2014, at WWNLive&#x27;s &quot;A Wrestling Odyssey&quot; event, Jazz unsuccessfully challenged Ivelisse for the Shine Championship.

=== Chikara (2016) ===

On September 2, 2016, Jazz made her debut for Chikara, when she entered the 2016 King of Trios tournament as part of Team Original Divas Revolution, alongside Victoria and Mickie James. They defeated Team Shimmer (Candice LeRae, Crazy Mary Dobson, and Solo Darling) in their first round match. The following day, Team Original Divas Revolution was eliminated from the tournament by The Warriors Three (Oleg the Usurper, Princess KimberLee, and ThunderFrog).

=== National Wrestling Alliance (2016–2019) ===
On September 16, 2016, Jazz captured the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship from Amber Gallows at NWA Texoma. On October 21, 2018, at the NWA 70th Anniversary Show, NWA&#x27;s first pay-per-view in years, Jazz successfully defended her championship against Penelope Ford. Throughout her championship reign, Jazz went on to fend off title contenders such as Allie, Jordynne Grace, and Thunder Rosa. Jazz was booked to defend her championship on April 27, 2019, at the Crockett Cup against Allysin Kay, but Jazz had vacated the title on April 22, 2019, due to medical and personal reasons. This ended a 948-day title reign. Jazz&#x27;s reign as the champion is the third longest reign in the company history, right after Debbie Combs and The Fabulous Moolah.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019) ===
On August 31, 2019, Jazz participated in the Casino Battle Royal taking place at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s All Out, but was not successful, as she was eliminated by ODB.

=== SWE Fury (2020) ===
Jazz held the SWE Fury Women&#x27;s Title until August when she dropped the title to Miranda Gordy. Then in September she formally retired from SWE Fury and became the very first SWE Fury Hall Of Famer. She was presented the award by James Beard and Teddy Long in San Antonio, TX.

=== Impact Wrestling (2020–2021) ===
Despite being retired, on the November 24, 2020 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jazz made her debut on Impact Wrestling as she revealed to team with Jordynne Grace in the Impact Knockouts Tag Team Championship Tournament since she would like to retire on top of her career, by winning the title with Grace. They would defeat Killer Kelly and Renee Michelle in the first round but were eliminated on the second round by Havok and Nevaeh. After a lost against Grace at Genesis, they faced the Tag Team Champions Fire N Flava at Sacrifice, where they were defeated. Her final match with Impact Wrestling took place at Hardcore Justice, where she faced Deonna Purrazzo for the Impact Knockouts Championship in a title vs career match. After a farewell segment on the April 15th edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, she began to work as a manager for Grace and her new partner, Rachael Ellering, before leaving Impact.

=== Return to NWA (2021–present) ===
After retiring from in-ring competition, Jazz revealed in April 2021 that she was offered to return to NWA as an agent. She would later work as a producer for When Our Shadows Fall and EmPowerrr pay-per-views. In February 2024, it was revealed that Jazz became NWA&#x27;s head of women&#x27;s division.

== Personal life ==

In high school, Carlene played basketball. She also had a basketball scholarship in college until a knee injury ended her basketball career. She later dropped out of college to work.

Carlene is married to Rodney Begnaud, who also competed as Rodney Mack in WWE. They live together in Lafayette, Louisiana on of land. The couple welcomed twin girls named Summer and Skye in November 2008.

She owns a fitness gym, which according to her is to &quot;keep the youth off the streets and keep them positive.&quot; She also runs a wrestling school with her husband called The Dog Pound.

In July 2016, she was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

Carlene has criticised WWE&#x27;s marketing, claiming they undermarketed her and other wrestlers of color:

<text>Krona is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics.

==Publication history==
Krona first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; Vol. 2 #40 (Oct. 1965) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane.

==Fictional character biography==
Born on Maltus, Krona is an Oan scientist who became obsessed with observing the origins of the universe itself, despite an ancient legend that said discovering that secret would cause a great calamity. Krona constructs a machine that pierces the temporal barrier and views the beginnings of time itself, but it explodes, shattering the universe and creating the multiverse. As punishment, Krona is transformed into pure energy by his fellow Oans and sentenced to wander the cosmos. Krona&#x27;s actions are what caused the Oans to become the Guardians of the Universe.

Krona returns to a physical state using Alan Scott&#x27;s mystical power ring, but is again turned into his energy form by the Guardians. Krona is restored to his original form thanks to Nekron and attempts to kill the Guardians, only to be defeated by the Green Lantern Corps.

Krona later resurfaces as the manifestation of Entropy and battles the New Guardians.

===Cross-universal threat===

While trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the Marvel Universe. There he confronts the Grandmaster, who, in an attempt to save his own universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona&#x27;s team (the Avengers) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks to him in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster&#x27;s team (the Justice League) wins, Krona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage and summons Galactus. The Grandmaster tricks Krona and locks him at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.

The Grandmaster&#x27;s hopes are dashed, though, when it becomes evident Krona would continue even in his extremely dangerous location in his insane quest to view the birth of a universe despite the risks posed to himself. Even from there, he continued his onslaught to destroy both the Marvel and DC universes to create a new one, so that he could watch creation first-hand. He forces them closer together, causing reality to warp wildly and making items and people switch worlds. He is briefly disrupted by the Scarlet Witch and Green Lantern, but continues his experiments. After being told what has happened by a dying Grandmaster, the two teams get to Krona&#x27;s stronghold, led by Captain America and coordinated by Martian Manhunter, pitting them against various brainwashed villains and increasing the scale of his &#x27;recruits&#x27; as the heroes defeat each wave. He nearly kills all the heroes of both teams as they penetrate his final wave of defenses—even with Superman wielding Captain America&#x27;s shield and Thor&#x27;s hammer— but Hawkeye and the Flash (Barry Allen), who had earlier faked their deaths, stop his plan, Hawkeye firing a TNT arrow at Krona&#x27;s machinery, sucking him into the Cosmic Egg. The Spectre pushes the worlds apart and reality returns to normal.

This egg is kept and studied in the JLA headquarters. Its fluctuations are a matter of intense scrutiny in the &quot;Syndicate Rules&quot; storyline, during which it is speculated that the reconstruction of the universes also altered the original &#x27;rules&#x27; that allowed the League and the Syndicate to always win on their home ground, requiring each to fight harder in the future. After the League believes they have the situation under control, they implement tighter scans on the egg to register alarms at even minor fluctuations. Metron later places several devices around the egg to feed false readings to the League and let it develop without interference.

===Trinity===

In the &quot;Trinity&quot; series, Despero, Morgaine le Fey and Enigma use the egg to create powerful monsters and reshape the world. In the aftermath of these events, Krona is freed. He recruits the Controllers in an attempt to communicate with the consciousness of the universe, but is double-crossed by them, who attempt to absorb and study his energies. In retaliation, Krona destroys them and their lab planet, only to hear the planet&#x27;s consciousness &quot;freed&quot; from its &quot;prison&quot;. Krona then sets out to do the same for many other planets.

Krona is later approached by Morgaine and her allies, seeking his power to fend off the returned Trinity (Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman). Morgaine offers the planet Earth&#x27;s consciousness in return, intending to replace it with the soul of Enigma&#x27;s daughter.

Krona accepts and a lengthy battle ensues between him, the JLA, JSA, Titans, Teen Titans, the God-like trinity consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, and other various heroes, aliens and villains. During the height of the battle Krona is imprisoned due to the united efforts of several heroes and villains, but is set free by Morgaine, finally snapped, claiming that if she cannot have the world, then nobody shall. Following that, Krona unleashes his powers and destroys the Earth.

Moments after Earth&#x27;s destruction he encounters its essence, the Worldsoul, which continuously alters its form between a little girl, an adult woman and an old hag. Krona inquires about the law of universes, wishing to know how the Worldsoul and other entities like it function and exist, hoping to learn of some higher plan or design. However, he is horrified to learn that the Worldsoul has no actual function other than to simply exist, resonate and, most importantly, to feel, to share in the positive emotions of every lifeform that dwells upon its surface, at one with the Universe in a Great Dance with the other souls of worlds. This explanation, such as it is, defies all logic and science Krona has studied, and he believes this renders himself and his entire life, in effect, pointless. In a fit of rage, he attempts to destroy the Worldsoul, but is stopped by the Trinity, who have survived the destruction of Earth. Combining their powers with that of the Worldsoul, they imprison Krona and reform the Earth, restoring everything and everyone to the way it was prior to its destruction, even the supervillains of the planet. Krona&#x27;s ultimate fate was to be remade as the Worldsoul of Earth-1, this time imprisoned for all eternity.

===War of the Green Lanterns===
After the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, a cloaked stranger appears on Ryut, walking near an ancient temple with seven pillars marked with the symbols of the Emotional Spectrum and plotting against the Lantern Corps.

The first act of this stranger&#x27;s plan occurs with the abduction of the fear entity, Parallax, during the finale of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, imprisoning the creature within the pillar marked with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He then proceeds to remove the willpower entity, Ion, from Sodam Yat, effectively turning Daxam&#x27;s sun from yellow back to red and killing hundreds of Daxamites in the process, and later helps Hector Hammond get out of prison, to pursue the Orange Lantern Entity, Ophidian, which is trapped inside Larfleeze&#x27;s lantern.

The stranger is also shown working with Hank Henshaw (Cyborg Superman), telling him that enslaving and altering the qualities of the Alpha Lanterns will restore his mortality. He is also shown working with the telepathic Zardor in his plot to brainwash rookie members of the Green Lantern Corps that will lead to the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps.

The stranger also freed Lyssa Drak from the Book of the Black, and informs her that her assistance is required since another book will soon be made and a keeper is needed.

The stranger later appears on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States—with an obedient Parallax in tow—where he faces Hal Jordan, Nicole Morrison, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and the Indigo Tribe, seeking to obtain both the hope entity, Adara, and the compassion entity, Proselyte, for his collection.

When the figure captures the entities by ripping Proselyte and Adara from their hosts, he is confronted by Jordan. The figure finally reveals himself as Krona, the rogue Guardian, long believed dead – the bandages serving to help restore his body after the damage he has sustained in his previous encounters – and tells Jordan that prior to his banishment by the Guardians, he was the caretaker responsible for protecting the entities, which explains how he&#x27;s aware of the orange power of avarice and its location as revealed during Hal Jordan&#x27;s first encounter with Larfleeze, and that is why he can control them and the abilities they possess.

Despite the combined efforts of the New Guardians (sans Sinestro and Carol Ferris), Krona still managed to overwhelm them with the assistance of Ophidian. Immobilized by Ophidian&#x27;s disruptive powers, Krona discovered the location of the Butcher from the avarice entity, and expunged it from Atrocitus&#x27;s power battery. As Hal struggled with his defiance, Krona unleashed the power of all of the entities, effectively defeating the New Guardians. Having no other reason for staying on Earth, Krona left with the entities in tow.

Later, as Hal Jordan, Larfleeze, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Indigo-1 and a returned Sinestro tried to reach Zamaron, since the entity of love was the only one still free, they found instead a delusional Carol Ferris who tells them that Krona had captured the Predator. Through Indigo-1 they follow Krona to the dead planet of Ryut where they found the Book of the Black, which after detecting the presence of the &quot;New Guardians&quot; opened its pages to unveil the history of Krona, revealing that it was Krona that was responsible for the Manhunters&#x27; programming glitch, which resulted in the annihilation of Sector 666. He did it to prove that there were flaws in an emotionless police force. He was also the one who created a gauntlet that harnessed Willpower which was the basis for the Green Lantern Power Ring. When he became the keeper of the emotional entities, he used the gauntlet to harness their powers and named it the Gauntlet of Power, since it could harness all emotions.

In the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot;, Krona, along with the emotional entities, attacks Oa, attacking the six remaining Guardians (with Ganthet working in the Anti-Matter universe at the time), by having them possessed by all the entities, except for Parallax, who is placed inside the Central Power Battery. With the yellow impurity returned to the Central Power Battery, all of the Green Lanterns—even the experienced wielders, with the apparent exception of the Green Lanterns who had been possessed by Parallax before—are placed under Krona&#x27;s control, revealing that they could not overcome the fear associated with it as the Guardians had thought. Even the Alpha Lanterns are affected by the yellow impurity which made them enter into some kind of hibernation. The former Guardian then declares that he will show the universe the true power of the Green Lanterns. However, despite his attempts to stop them by using Mogo against them, Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner are able to escape Krona and fight back by using the rings of the other Corps to escape Parallax&#x27;s influence long enough to kill Mogo and extract Parallax from the Power Battery. Undaunted, Krona uses all seven varieties of power ring at once, attacking Hal Jordan and Sinestro. Despite his greater power, Krona is eventually killed by Hal Jordan, which leads him to being discharged by the Guardians of the Universe for treason. Ganthet honors his promise to Atrocitus and gives Krona&#x27;s corpse to him to do as he wishes.

===The New 52===
Following the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot;, it is revealed that Atrocitus has kept Krona&#x27;s corpse as a &#x27;confidant&#x27;, talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the Red Lantern Corps and his plans to upgrade their intelligence. After granting intellects to three Red Lanterns, Atrocitus returns to the place where he has left Krona&#x27;s body only to find it missing. Although Atrocitus attempts to find Krona&#x27;s body, he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that Krona has come back to life, when faced with a revolt from Bleez, Atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of Krona&#x27;s body has robbed him of the focus of his rage, as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he previously considered his mere identity enough of a justification. Krona&#x27;s body, however, is found to be possessed by Abysmus, a demonic entity created by the earliest experiments of Atrocitus with shamanistic and necromantic magic, who ate his body and flayed his skin to empower himself and a race of similar creatures, the so-called Abysmorphs.

Following the events of &quot;Rise of the Third Army&quot;, in the opening of &quot;Wrath of the First Lantern&quot;, Krona&#x27;s history has been changed: although he attempted to observe the beginning of the universe, the cosmos-spanning hand now bears a Lantern Power ring and when the viewscreen explodes, it is because a time-travelling ship has just arrived. From the ship, appears the mysterious Volthoom. During a conversation with Atrocitus, Krona&#x27;s spirit-which manifests as a result of Abysmus&#x27;s manipulations-claims that he became caught up in his work after his wives and child were killed in an accident, but Atrocitus dismisses the idea that this excuses his later actions; moments later, the newly freed Volthoom disperses Krona&#x27;s spirit, apparently ending the last remnants of his existence.

It was also revealed that Krona&#x27;s banishment from the Guardians of the Universe was not from the result of his machinations, but because he ordered the Manhunters to destroy Sector 666.

===The Lost Army===
Krona later finds John Stewart, Kilowog, Arisia Rrab, Two-Six and new Lantern Xrill-Vrek in a seemingly hostile territory, a long way from home. Given that this Krona is back to his Maltusan look, does not recognize any of the Green Lanterns and that the Green Lantern rings cannot locate anyone or the Central Power Battery, provides a little clue as to what has happened. Either they have been displaced to another universe, another time, or both.

==Powers and abilities==
Krona possesses a supreme genius-level intellect, but his arrogance, lack of patience, short temper and above all insatiable hunger for knowledge have gotten the better of him. If it brought him any benefit, he would be the sort to attempt to quantify dance or measure a soul, solely for the sake of knowing. It is this madness that got Krona exiled and brought about his constant defeats. He has unhesitatingly destroyed universes and risked his own existence for a chance to gain deeper insight.

Like the rest of his species, Krona possesses enhanced physical abilities, psionic powers (including telepathy and telekinesis) and virtual immortality. His powers were later increased by Nekron, making him more powerful than any of the Guardians.

As Entropy, Krona was composed of anti-energy, could absorb others into his body, converting them into more anti-energy, and was able to create an army composed of anti-energy that were completely under his control. During the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; miniseries, where he wielded the power of all the universes he had previously destroyed, Krona proved able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, although the Grandmaster&#x27;s power was sufficient to make him initially hesitant at the prospect of fighting the other being until his attempt to beat the Grandmaster in a game to gain the information he sought failed.

Also, as the caretaker of the emotional entities which are the pure embodiments of the emotions comprising the Emotional Spectrum, Krona wields the powers of the entire emotional spectrum.

<doc id="982689" wikidata="Q2623352" url="?curid=982689" title="All Flesh Must Be Eaten">
<text>All Flesh Must Be Eaten or AFMBE is an Origins Award nominated
survival horror role-playing game (RPG) produced by Eden Studios, Inc. using the &quot;Unisystem&quot; game system.
&quot;AFMBE&quot; is derived from the traditional horror movie depictions of zombies who rise from the dead as mindless monsters that consume the living. In addition to producing a revised edition and many RPG supplements, there have been many works of fiction published that take place in one of the game&#x27;s many settings.

&quot;AFMBE&quot; is one of the first RPGs to focus on zombies as the main aspect of survival horror. While other games do have zombies, &quot;AFMBE&quot; was the first to make them central. &quot;AFMBE&quot; was also the first new &quot;Unisystem&quot; game produced by Eden under their exclusive licenses of the &quot;Unisystem&quot; game.

The main rule book details character creation, skills, qualities (positive characteristics), drawbacks (negative characteristics), zombie creation rules, character archetypes and several campaign settings (called &quot;Deadworlds&quot; in the jargon of the game). The game has a large following and several expansion books.

&quot;AFMBE&quot; genre books also serve double duty as expansions to the &quot;Classic Unisystem&quot; rules for various movie, TV and literature genres, such as the Western, pulp fiction, and sci-fi. The Revised Edition also includes an appendix detailing conversions to the &quot;d20 System&quot;.

==Expansions==

<text>The Vought SB2U Vindicator is an American carrier-based dive bomber developed for the United States Navy in the 1930s, the first monoplane in this role. Vindicators still remained in service at the time of the Battle of Midway, but by 1943, all had been withdrawn to training units. It was known as the Chesapeake in Royal Navy service.

==Design and development==
In 1934, the United States Navy issued a requirement for a new Scout Bomber for carrier use, and received proposals from six manufacturers. The specification was issued in two parts, one for a monoplane, and one for a biplane. Vought submitted designs in both categories, which would become the XSB2U-1 and XSB3U-1 respectively. The biplane was considered alongside the monoplane design as a &quot;hedge&quot; against the U.S. Navy&#x27;s reluctance to pursue the modern configuration.

The XSB2U-1 was of conventional low-wing monoplane configuration with a retractable conventional tailwheel landing gear, the pilot and tail gunner being seated in tandem under a long greenhouse-style canopy. The fuselage was of steel tube construction, covered with aluminum panels from the nose to the rear cockpit with a fabric-covered rear fuselage, while the folding cantilever wing was of all-metal construction. A Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1535 Twin-Wasp Junior radial engine drove a two-blade constant-speed propeller, which was intended to act as a dive brake during a dive bombing attack. The use of propeller braking was not entirely successful, and in practice US Navy Vindicators lowered the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage to act as a speed brake and dived at shallower angles. A single bomb could be carried on a swinging trapeze to allow it to clear the propeller in a steep dive, while further bombs could be carried under the wings to give a maximum bombload of .

The SB2U was evaluated against the Brewster XSBA-1, Curtiss XSBC-3, Great Lakes XB2G-1, Grumman XSBF-1 and Northrop XBT-1. All but the Great Lakes and Grumman submissions were ordered into production. Designated XSB2U-1, one prototype was ordered on 15 October 1934 and was delivered on 15 April 1936. Accepted for operational evaluation on 2 July 1936, the prototype XSB2U-1, BuNo &quot;9725&quot;, crashed on 20 August 1936. Its successful completion of trials led to further orders, with 56 SB2U-1s ordered on 26 October 1936, and a further 58 of a slightly modified version, the SB2U-2, on 6 October 1938.

The SB2U-3 was a more heavily modified version, intended as a long-range scout bomber, capable of being fitted with a conventional wheeled undercarriage, for operations from aircraft carriers or land airbases, or with floats. To give the required increased range, the fuselage fuel tank fitted to the SB2U-1 and -2 was supplemented by integral wing tanks, while the aircraft&#x27;s tail had an increased span. The prototype XSB2U-3, converted from the last SB2U-1, flew in February 1939, and after testing as both a landplane and floatplane, 57 SB2U-3s were ordered on 25 September 1939, mainly for the US Marine Corps.

The SB2U is prominently featured in the 1941 film &quot;Dive Bomber&quot;.

There were 260 examples of all Vindicator variants produced, and a single example is preserved at the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Navy===

Deliveries to the US Navy began in December 1937, when four aircraft joined VB-3 aboard the aircraft carrier , replacing Curtiss BFC-2 biplanes. As well as &quot;Saratoga&quot;, Vindicators served on the carriers , , and . Air Group Nine, destined for , trained in Vindicators aboard the escort carrier , but they transitioned to the Douglas SBD Dauntless before &quot;Essex&quot; joined the war.

During the attack on Pearl Harbor, seven &quot;Vindicators&quot; from the U.S. squadron VMSB-231 were destroyed at Ewa Field.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
VMSB-231 and VMSB-241 were the only two USMC squadrons that fielded the Marine-specific SB2U-3 between March 1941 and September 1943. VMSB-241&#x27;s Vindicators saw combat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Airmen with experience in more modern aircraft spoke disparagingly of SB2Us as &quot;vibrators&quot; or &quot;wind indicators&quot; in their later combat assignments. Captain Richard E. Fleming piloted a SB2U-3 Vindicator in an attack on the Japanese cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot; on 5 June 1942, for which he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

===French Navy===
On 22 February 1939, France placed an order for 20 V-156-Fs for the carrier-based squadrons of the &quot;Aéronautique Navale&quot; (French Naval Aviation), with an order for 20 more V-156-Fs following in May 1939. Based on the SB2U-2, the V-156-F incorporated specific French equipment, included Darne machine guns and French radios, while the aircraft were fitted with dive brakes, as tested and rejected by the US Navy. The aircraft were delivered to France in crates and reassembled at Orly, with the first example flying in France on 6 August 1939. On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the French Navy decided that its only aircraft carrier, was too slow for operational service, and the ship&#x27;s squadrons disembarked for land-based service. By mid-October 1939, the first &quot;escadrille&quot;, AB 1, had reequipped with the V-156-F, while a second &quot;escadrille&quot;, AB 3, was formed in November 1939. In March–April 1940, AB 1&#x27;s pilots carried out successful deck-landing training aboard &quot;Béarn&quot;, and were declared carrier qualified. 

On 10 May 1940, on the opening day of the German invasion of France, all 12 of AB 3&#x27;s aircraft were destroyed in a German air raid on Boulogne airfield. AB 1 was ordered up to Northern France from Hyères as a replacement, sustaining heavy losses while attacking bridges and German ground targets in Northern France, including seven aircraft shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s during an attack on a bridge over the Sambre–Oise Canal on 20 May 1940, and later that month provided air cover for the Evacuation of Dunkirk. AB 3, which had had its losses replaced by V-156-Fs taken out of storage, was deployed against the Italians following the Italian invasion of France on 10 June and on 14 June, four V-156s attacked the , which was unharmed. By the time of the Armistice, there were only a handful of remaining Voughts in French hands, and the type was phased out of service.

===Royal Navy===
France had placed an order for a further 50 V-156-Fs in March 1940, with delivery planned from March 1941. Following the defeat of France, this order was taken over by the British government for use by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, who named the aircraft the Chesapeake. The British required several modifications to the Chesapeake, including the additional fuel tank fitted to the SB2U-3, additional armor and heavier forward firing armament, with four rifle caliber machine guns replacing the single forward-firing Darne machine gun of the French aircraft. Fourteen Chesapeakes were used to equip a reformed 811 Naval Air Squadron on 14 July 1941 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent. The squadron, whose crews referred to the aircraft as the &quot;cheesecake&quot;, intended to use them for anti-submarine patrols, and they were earmarked for the escort carrier .

By the end of October that year, it had been decided that the Chesapeakes were underpowered for the planned duties and would not be able to lift a useful payload from the small escort carriers. Accordingly, they were withdrawn from 811 Squadron in November 1941 for use as training aircraft and the unit was re-equipped with the biplane Fairey Swordfish.

<text>Uyaquq (also Uyaquk or Uyakoq; sometimes referred to in English as Helper Neck) (ca. 1860–1924) was a member of the Yup&#x27;ik people who became a Helper in the Moravian Church. Noted for his linguistic abilities, he went from being an illiterate adult to inventing a series of writing systems for his native language and then producing translations of the Bible and other religious works in a period of five years.

== Biography ==
Uyaquq was born into a family of shamans in the lower Kuskokwim River valley of central Alaska in the mid-1860s. Even by the standards of the day, Uyaquq was a small man. He became a shaman in early adulthood, but converted to Christianity after his father converted. Although his father became a Russian Orthodox, Uyaquq became a leader and missionary in the Alaskan Moravian Church. His name means &quot;Neck&quot; in English and he was called that by some English speakers.

As a missionary, Uyaquq is said to have converted whole villages of Yupik in the lower Kuskokwim River valley to Christianity. He is said to have had a gentle personality and have been a very erudite speaker.
Uyaquq was fascinated by the idea that the English-speaking Moravians could quote a passage of scripture several times using exactly the same words each time. He discovered that they accomplished this by reading from a written text. Uyaquq became fascinated with the idea of writing and, according to his descendants, received the idea for the first version of the script he used to write his dialect, Yugtun, in a dream.

Reverend John Hinz, a Moravian missionary in Alaska, and an accomplished linguist, was astonished upon hearing of Uyaquq&#x27;s invention. Hinz took Uyaquq to the Bethel mission house so that he could continue his linguistic work. Uyaquq is said to have written constantly during the trip, writing as many stories from the Bible as he could in the new script without stopping to sleep. Hinz and the Kilbucks aided Uyaquq by telling him scriptures, but Uyaquq refused to learn to read or write English, as he thought that English literacy would make him lose his identity as a Yupik.

In the next five years, Uyaquq&#x27;s Yugtun script evolved from its original form of pictographs to a syllabary. This evolution began when Uyaquq decided that his hieroglyphics were a good memory aid but they did not represent passages with enough accuracy that they could be reproduced verbatim time after time. Uyaquq identified the concept of a syllable and his script evolved in five stages until he had created a symbol for each syllable in the language. Each of the five steps was documented in several notebooks kept by Uyaquq. He taught his writing system to several of his missionary helpers and they used it in their church work.

Although the system adopted by most people for writing Yupik was the Roman-based script of Reverend Hinz, and, in about 1970, the University of Alaska system, Uyaquq&#x27;s system has been studied because it may represent the same process of evolution from illiteracy to proto-writing to syllabary taken by many ancient written languages, like Chinese and Egyptian, but compressed into a period of five years. Uyaquq&#x27;s notebooks and the writings of those who watched him at work have been the subject of research, beginning with Dr. Alfred Schmitt in the 1930s.

<text>Robyn Rowan Hitchcock (born 3 March 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano, and bass guitar. After leading the Soft Boys in the late 1970s and releasing the influential &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot;, in June 1980, Hitchcock launched a prolific solo career.

Hitchcock&#x27;s earliest lyrics mined a rich vein of English surrealist comic tradition and tended to depict a particular type of eccentric and sardonic English worldview. His music and performance style was influenced by Bob Dylan, and by the English folk music revival of the 1960s and early 1970s. This was soon filtered through a then-unfashionable psychedelic rock lens during the punk rock and new wave music eras of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This combination of musical styles won Hitchcock&#x27;s band of the time, The Soft Boys, an enthusiastic if small fanbase. However, the Soft Boys&#x27; final album together, &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot;, posthumously earned them a glowing reputation (particularly in America) as a major influence on bands like R.E.M.

After finding a measure of success in the latter 1980s in America, Hitchcock&#x27;s lyrical and musical horizons broadened further to encompass a range of approaches while still retaining a recognisably surreal, but more serious, signature style. He has recorded for two major American labels (A&amp;M Records, then Warner Bros.) over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, and was the subject of a live performance/documentary film (&quot;Storefront Hitchcock&quot;) by major motion picture director Jonathan Demme in 1998. Since the turn of the millennium he has also finally received belated critical recognition in his home country. Despite this, mainstream success remains limited. He continues to tour and record prolifically and has earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances, and a dedicated &quot;cult following&quot; for his unique body of work.

==Career==

===The Soft Boys to the Egyptians (1972–1993)===

While at art school in London around 1972, Hitchcock was a member of the college band the Beetles. In 1974, he moved to Cambridge, where he did some busking, and joined a series of local bands: B.B. Blackberry and the Swelterettes, the Worst Fears, and Maureen and the Meatpackers. His next group, Dennis and the Experts, became the neo-psychedelia band The Soft Boys in 1976, recording their first EP, &quot;Give It to the Soft Boys&quot;, at Spaceward studios, Cambridge, in 1977. After recording &quot;A Can of Bees&quot; (1979) and &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot; (1980), the latter of which was described in Rolling Stone as a &quot;classic&quot; and influential on bands such as R.E.M. and The Replacements, the group broke up in 1981.

In 1981, Hitchcock released his solo debut, &quot;Black Snake Diamond Röle&quot;, which included instrumental backing by several former Soft Boys. He followed it in 1982 with the generally critically maligned &quot;Groovy Decay&quot;. Following his solo acoustic album &quot;I Often Dream of Trains&quot; in 1984, he formed a new band, The Egyptians, comprising former members of the Soft Boys (Andy Metcalfe and Morris Windsor, supplemented at first by early keyboardist Roger Jackson), resulting in their 1985 debut &quot;Fegmania!&quot;, which featured typically surrealist Hitchcock songs such as &quot;My Wife and My Dead Wife&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Lightbulb Head&quot;. (A live album, &quot;Gotta Let This Hen Out!&quot;, was released at the end of that year.) Their popularity grew with the 1986 album &quot;Element of Light&quot; and they were subsequently signed to A&amp;M Records in the U.S. The album &quot;Globe of Frogs&quot;, released in 1988, further expanded their reach, as the single &quot;Balloon Man&quot; became a college radio and MTV hit, followed in 1989 by &quot;Madonna of the Wasps&quot; from their &quot;Queen Elvis&quot; album. In 1989, they also teamed up with Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Peter Holsapple of The dB&#x27;s, playing two gigs as Nigel and the Crosses, mostly covers.

At the beginning of 1990, Hitchcock took a break from the Egyptians and A&amp;M Records to release another solo acoustic album, &quot;Eye&quot;, then resumed with the band&#x27;s &quot;Perspex Island&quot; release in 1991. 1993&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot;, influenced a great deal by his father&#x27;s death, marked the last Egyptians release and the end of his association with A&amp;M Records.

===Reunions and solo career, 1994–2006===

Early in 1994, after disbanding the Egyptians, Hitchcock embarked on a short reunion tour with the Soft Boys. His work received a slight boost in 1995 when his back catalogue (including both solo releases and Egyptians albums) were re-packaged and re-issued in the United States by the respected Rhino Records label. For the rest of the decade, he continued recording and performing as a solo artist, releasing several albums on Warner Brothers Records, such as 1996&#x27;s &quot;Moss Elixir&quot; (which featured the contributions of violinist Deni Bonet and guitarist Tim Keegan), and the soundtrack from the Jonathan Demme-directed concert film &quot;Storefront Hitchcock&quot; in 1998. The 1999 release &quot;Jewels for Sophia&quot;, also on Warner, featured cameos from Southern California-based musicians Jon Brion and Grant-Lee Phillips, both of whom often shared the stage with Hitchcock when he played Los Angeles nightclub Largo. An album of outtakes from the Sophia sessions called &quot;A Star for Bram&quot; followed, released on Hitchcock&#x27;s own label. 

In 2000, the Italian music writer Luca Ferrari released a long interview with Hitchcock, &quot;A Middle Class Hero&quot; (Stampa Alternativa), in the form of a 96-page booklet in English and Italian accompanying a three-song CD of unreleased tracks.

In 2001, Hitchcock reunited and toured with Kimberley Rew, bassist Matthew Seligman, and Morris Windsor for the Soft Boys&#x27; re-release of their best-known album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot;. The following year they recorded and released a new album, &quot;Nextdoorland&quot;, accompanied by a short album of outtakes, &quot;Side Three&quot;. The reunion was short-lived.

The 2002 double album &quot;Robyn Sings&quot; comprised cover versions of Bob Dylan songs, including a live re-creation (performed in 1996) of Dylan&#x27;s so-called &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; 1966 concert. Hitchcock celebrated his 50th birthday in 2003 with a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London at which his then-new solo acoustic album &quot;Luxor&quot; was given away as a gift to all those attending, and an original poem of his was read by actor Alan Rickman. He continued collaborating with a series of different musicians, as on the album &quot;Spooked&quot;, which was recorded with country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. 

===The Venus 3 to present===


In 2006, &quot;Olé! Tarantula&quot; was released with the Venus 3, a band which consisted of longtime friends and collaborators R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck and Young Fresh Fellows&#x27; frontman Scott McCaughey, as well as Ministry&#x27;s Bill Rieflin (by then also R.E.M.&#x27;s full-time drummer). The song &quot;&#x27;Cause It&#x27;s Love (Saint Parallelogram)&quot; was written with Andy Partridge of XTC.

In 2007, he was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Robyn Hitchcock: Sex, Food, Death... and Insects&quot;, directed by John Edginton, shown on the U.S. Sundance Channel and in the UK on BBC Four (and later released on DVD). &quot;Food, sex and death are all corridors to life if you like. You need sex to get you here, you need food to keep you here and you need death to get you out and they’re the entry and exit signs.&quot; The filmmaker eavesdrops on Hitchcock at work on his latest collection of songs with contributors including Nick Lowe, former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, Peter Buck and Gillian Welch. The film culminates with Hitchcock and the band taking the songs on the road in America. A live EP with The Venus 3, &quot;Sex, Food, Death... and Tarantulas&quot;, was released in conjunction with the documentary. The film also includes candid interviews with Hitchcock, who reveals much about the source of his work: &quot;At heart I&#x27;m a frightened angry person. That&#x27;s probably why my stuff isn&#x27;t totally insubstantial. I&#x27;m constantly, deep down inside, in a kind of rage.&quot;

Late in 2007, Hitchcock&#x27;s music was again re-packaged and re-released in the U.S.; Yep Roc Records began an extensive reissue campaign with three early solo releases and a double-CD compilation of rarities, which would be available separately or as part of a new boxed set release, &quot;I Wanna Go Backwards&quot;. In 2008, that boxed set was followed up with &quot;Luminous Groove&quot;, a boxed set of three early Egyptians releases and two further discs of rarities. In 2009, the electro-pop artist and remixer Pocket released an EP featuring Hitchcock called &quot;Surround Him With Love&quot;, while Hitchcock released an entirely separate new album, &quot;Goodnight Oslo&quot;, with the Venus 3. At the end of the year, a live album called &quot;I Often Dream of Trains in New York&quot; documented the late-2008 onstage re-creation of his acclaimed 1984 acoustic album (a limited-edition deluxe version also included the materials to construct a kind of moving-image generator called a phenakistoscope). In 2009, he contributed to The Decemberists&#x27; concept album &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;, performing the short instrumental solo &quot;An Interlude.&quot; Also in 2009, Hitchcock provided the score for the film &quot;Women in Trouble&quot;, a feminist/exploitation &quot;chick flick&quot;.

Concurrent with the redesign of his official website in early 2010, Hitchcock began to offer a series of &quot;Phantom 45s&quot; as downloads, each &quot;45&quot; being two newly recorded songs that would initially be offered as a free download. He also released the &quot;Propellor Time&quot; album, containing new material partially based on the &quot;Sex, Food, Death&quot; sessions shown in the 2007 documentary, but mainly featuring the Venus 3. In 2011, he released &quot;Tromsø, Kaptein&quot;, an album of songs written in Norway, and released physically only in that country. Hitchcock was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform &quot;I Often Dream of Trains&quot; at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival, to be curated by Mangum in March 2012 in Minehead, England. The album &quot;Love From London&quot; (working title: File Under Pop) was released on Yep Roc Records on 5 March 2013. The label also released his subsequent record, &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;, on 26 August 2014. April 2015 saw Hitchcock team up with Emma Swift to release a limited Record Store Day 7&quot; single &quot;Follow Your Money&quot;, backed with a stripped back cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Motion Pictures.&quot; The pair subsequently toured, releasing another 7&quot; single double A side with the songs &quot;Love Is A Drag&quot; and &quot;Life Is Change&quot;, produced by Teenage Fanclub&#x27;s Norman Blake.
In 2017, he released his eponymous album &quot;Robyn Hitchcock&quot;. Working with Brendan Benson as co-producer, the album saw a return to a full band sound after his previous release, with guest appearances from Gillian Welch and Emma Swift.

Hitchcock wrote the song &quot;Sunday Never Comes&quot; for the 2018 film &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot;, which was sung in the movie by Ethan Hawke&#x27;s character, an aging, reclusive musician. He later released a companion video of his own version of the song.

In September 2019, Hitchcock collaborated with XTC frontman Andy Partridge on a four-song EP &quot;Planet England&quot;, co-writing the songs and both singing. In 2020, he released &quot;The Man Downstairs: Demos &amp; Rarities&quot;, an album of outtakes recorded in 2013 as demos for &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;. He also appeared on Emma Swift&#x27;s album of Bob Dylan covers, &quot;Blonde on the Tracks&quot;, recorded between 2017 and 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Wilco&#x27;s Pat Sansone.

== Personal life ==

Hitchcock was born in Paddington in West London, son of novelist Raymond Hitchcock (writer of &quot;Percy&quot;). He grew up in the small village of Abbots Worthy, Hampshire, near Winchester. He was educated at Winchester College, where he was a &quot;groovy and alternative&quot; friend of Julia Darling, daughter of a physics teacher at the college; his song &quot;Underground Sun&quot; is about her. While at Winchester College, he is introduced to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s autobiographical tale of drug use, &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, and to the music of Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. Even though he objected to worship, he joined in singing a &quot;cornucopia of tunes&quot; of Church of England hymns including &quot;Eternal Father, Strong to Save&quot;, &quot;Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer&quot;, and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, which he describes as &quot;fabulous, permanent songs&quot;. After leaving Winchester in 1972, he went to art school in London.

He collaborated with director Jonathan Demme in 1998 for a live concert and film &quot;Storefront Hitchcock&quot;, and later appeared in Demme&#x27;s 2004 remake of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, in which he played double agent Laurent Tokar. He appeared in Demme&#x27;s &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; in 2008, singing and playing guitar in the wedding-party band. In September 2008, he joined the Disko Bay Cape Farewell expedition to the West Coast of Greenland. Cape Farewell is a UK-based arts organisation that brings artists, scientists and communicators together to instigate a cultural response to climate change. In August 2015, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee. He lives in East Nashville with his wife Emma Swift and their cats. He had a daughter, Maisie, from a previous relationship; she died in 2023 of peritoneal cancer.

In his 2024 memoir &quot;1967: How I Got There and Why I Never Left&quot;, Hitchcock stated &quot;I am [as a boy] what would in the twenty-first century be called &#x27;on the spectrum&#x27;: it turns out that I have most of the symptoms of Asperger&#x27;s, at the high-functioning end of autism.&quot;

Godfrey played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs football and was selected in the 1996 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys with the 49th overall pick. He then played for the Tennessee Titans and the Seattle Seahawks.

==Early life==
Godfrey attended Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia, where he was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball and track). As a senior, he finished with 111 tackles, 6 sacks and 2 interceptions, receiving All-American, All-State and All-South honors.

He accepted a scholarship from the University of Georgia, where he majored in housing and consumer economics. He became the first true freshman in school history to lead the team in tackles (114) and was also named SEC Freshman of the Year. The next year, he repeated as the team leader in tackles (114) and earned All-SEC honors.

As a junior, he registered 102 tackles (second on the team), 2 sacks and 5 passes defensed. In his last year he missed four games with a pulled hamstring, affecting his playing time and finishing with 35 tackles (3 for loss).

==Professional career==

===Dallas Cowboys===
Godfrey was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft, after dropping because of his diminished production as a college senior. Although he was selected to play middle linebacker, the level of skill and speed he demonstrated in training camp, allowed the Cowboys to move him into different defensive positions.

He started the last six games of his rookie season at strongside linebacker replacing Broderick Thomas. The next year, he registered 149 tackles (second on the team), one sack and 2 passes defensed. In 1998, he finished with 115 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.

In 1999, he led the team with 143 tackles after being switched to his natural position at middle linebacker, replacing Fred Strickland who was released.

In the 90&#x27;s, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards and Robert Jones, to leave via free agency, instead of signing them into long-term contracts.

During the 2000 free agency period, although Godfrey was firmly entrenched as the team starting middle linebacker, the Cowboys chose not to match the offer he received from the Tennessee Titans and decided to let Dat Nguyen take over the position. He never missed a game in his four seasons in Dallas, recording 438 tackles, 5 quarterback sacks and 2 interceptions.

===Tennessee Titans===
In 2000, he set a career-high with 169 tackles and was named second-team All-Pro. He also registered 3 sacks, 6 passes defensed, 2 fumble recoveries and 2 interceptions.

Godfrey led the Titans in tackles each of his first two seasons with the team. Because of a right ankle injury he suffered in the season opener, he only played in 8 games (5 starts) during the 2002 season, finishing with 44 tackles and a sack.

Even though the Titans reworked his contract, with him agreeing to take less money, the team released him for salary cap reasons at the start of training camp in 2003.

===Seattle Seahawks===
Godfrey signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks, where he started 14 games and had 59 tackles in 2003.

===San Diego Chargers===
The San Diego Chargers signed Godfrey to a three-year deal in 2004. He was released after the 2007 NFL draft.

===Washington Redskins===
On August 21, 2007, Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, seeking to rebuild an injury-riddled linebacking corps, talked Godfrey out of retirement. He was not re-signed after the season and retired.

On October 28, 2007, Godfrey made critical remarks regarding New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Following a game in which the Patriots defeated the Redskins 52–7, Godfrey accused Belichick of showing the Redskins &quot;no respect&quot; because the Patriots continued to call deep passing plays despite leading 38-0 entering the fourth quarter. Belichick defended his play calling, saying &quot;When you&#x27;re playing defense it&#x27;s your job to stop them. It&#x27;s not (the offense&#x27;s) job to not score.&quot;

<doc id="982700" wikidata="Q2706386" url="?curid=982700" title="HMS Archer (D78)">
<text>HMS &quot;Archer was a built by the United States in 1939–1940 and operated by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was built as the [[cargo ship]] Mormacland, but was converted to an escort carrier and renamed HMS &quot;Archer&quot;. Her transmission was a constant cause of problems which led to her being withdrawn from front-line service. She was used as a stores ship and then as an accommodation ship before a refit and subsequent use as a [[Merchant Aircraft Carrier|merchant aircraft ferry ship]], Empire Lagan&quot;.

She was returned to the US Navy, then laid up as Archer before being sold into merchant service and converted to a passenger ship, Anna Salén. She was used to take emigrants to Australia and Canada in the early 1950s. She was sold and renamed Tasmania and after further service as an emigrant ship was converted back to a cargo ship. She was later sold and renamed Union Reliance. She was scrapped after a collision and fire in 1961.

==Description and construction==
&quot;Mormacland&quot; was laid down as a Type C3 cargo ship on 1 August 1939, under United States Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull 46), by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, as Yard number 184. She was launched on 14 December 1939 and completed on 24 April 1940.

She was powered by four seven-cylinder two-stroke single-acting diesel engines. These drove a single screw via Westinghouse electro-magnetic slip couplings and Falk single reduction gears. The engines were built by Busch-Sulzer Brothers Diesel Engine Co, St Louis, Missouri with 20½ inches bore and 27 inches stroke (520 mm by 690 mm). They developed a total of each. As HMS &quot;Archer&quot;, she had a range of at . The propulsion system was also used on the four sister ships built by Sun Shipbuilding in 1939: &quot;Mormacpenn&quot;, &quot;Mormacyork&quot;, &quot;Mormacland&quot; and &quot;Mormacmail&quot;

HMS &quot;Archer&quot; was the only in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was converted from the American merchant ship &quot;Mormacland&quot; which was built at the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She was laid down on 1 August 1939, launched on 14 December 1939 and delivered on 24 April 1940.

She was converted to an escort aircraft carrier at Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co, Newport News, Virginia and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 17 November 1941.

&quot;Archer&quot; had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the -long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the half hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised three single mounted 4-inch dual purpose anti-aircraft guns and fifteen 20 mm cannons on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for fifteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Service history==
&quot;Mormacland&quot; was assessed at . She was operated by Moore-McCormack Lines Inc., with New York as her homeport, until 6 March 1941 when she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and sent to Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co, Newport News, Virginia, for conversion to an aircraft carrier.

===BAVG 1===
When requisitioned by the US Navy, &quot; Mormacland&quot; was designated BAVG-1, the first hull of the series intended for delivery to the Royal Navy. The conversion consisted of a lightweight wooden flight deck on a truss frame being added on top of the ship which covered about 70% of the ship&#x27;s length. The deck was serviced by a single lift aft where the aircraft hangar was situated. The conversion was completed on 15 November 1941. As converted, she was transferred to the Royal Navy.

&quot;Archer&quot; was a sister of the . Like the &quot;Long Island&quot;, the &quot;Archer&quot; had no island structure. Her original bridge was retained and extended at the sides to provide visibility. Her funnel was replaced by twin diesel vents to either side of the flight deck. Her Busch-Sulzer engines sometimes produced so much black smoke that landing aircraft couldn&#x27;t see the batman or flight deck.

===HMS &quot;Archer&quot;===
Two days after the conversion was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy as part of the Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on &quot;Archer&quot; for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to dive into the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. &quot;Archer&quot; put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, &quot;Archer&quot; successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Martlet Is.

She departed Norfolk on 13 January but was soon in trouble, as her steering developed a fault and her gyro compass failed. Repairs were made and she set course for Kingston, Jamaica. Later that day &quot;Archer&quot; had a collision with the U.S. freighter &quot;Brazos&quot; some east of Charleston, South Carolina (). &quot;Archer&quot; sustained damage to her bow, and eventually settled down at the bow by 5 degrees after the damage and flooding had been contained. Both ships were dead in the water. The 35 crewmembers of &quot;Brazos&quot; transferred to &quot;Archer&quot; in their own lifeboats and &quot;Brazos&quot; sank on 14 January. &quot;Archer&quot;″s captain had radioed for assistance and at first light started to make for the coast, but as her propeller was half out of the water, progress was minimal. On 16 January, &quot;Archer&quot; rendezvoused with US Coast Guard tug which unsuccessfully attempted to tow &quot;Archer&quot;. It was decided that &quot;Archer&quot; should continue under her own power until a more powerful tug could assist her. On 17 January, reached her and proceeded to tow her to Charleston, where she arrived on 21 January. She entered dry dock on 28 January for repairs, which took about six weeks.

On 7 March 1942, &quot;Archer&quot; embarked twelve Martlets for delivery to and her own four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 834 Squadron which had flown out from Jamaica. She sailed on 18 March for San Juan, Puerto Rico, in company with and two destroyers as part of Convoy AS 2. On 22 March &quot;Archer&quot; again had problems with her steering gear. She put into San Juan on 23 March and rejoined the convoy on 24 March. Anti-submarine patrols were carried out without a sighting, although one Swordfish was badly damaged on 30 March when it lost its tailhook and ended up in the safety barrier. Although her engines and gyro compass continued to give trouble, she arrived at Freetown. Sierra Leone on 3 April. On 9 April, &quot;Archer&quot;″s twelve brand new Martlets were transferred to &quot;Illustrious&quot; and two Martlets from &quot;Illustrious&quot; were transferred to &quot;Archer&quot;.

On 15 June 1942, one of her Swordfish aircraft became the first ever aircraft to land on Ascension Island. The aircraft&#x27;s crew were looking for survivors from SS &quot;Lyle Park&quot; which had been sunk by . They landed to pass on a message destined for the Admiralty.

&quot;Archer&quot;″s powerplant continued to give trouble, particularly the electro-magnetic clutches. If the clutch disengaged the engines would race at high revs and had to be shut down in order for repairs to be made. This was particularly problematic if aircraft were flying or there were enemy submarines nearby. On 26 June, &quot;Archer&quot; departed Freetown bound for Bermuda, where she was to undergo repairs. Work started on 15 July and took some fourteen weeks to complete. &quot;Archer&quot; then sailed to New York City where she joined Convoy UGS 2 which departed New York on 2 November bound for Casablanca, Morocco. She ferried 30 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and US personnel to Casablanca. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join convoy MKF 3 which departed Gibraltar on 27 November. When &quot;Archer&quot; arrived in the UK, she was sent to Liverpool for another refit which commenced on 4 December. Her flight deck was lengthened at this refit.

On 19 February 1943, &quot;Archer&quot; embarked nine Martlet Vs of 892 Squadron and on 28 February embarked nine Swordfish Mk II aircraft of 819 Squadron. She was inspected by King George VI the following day and then sent to shipyards on the Clyde and at Belfast for further rectification work. In early May, &quot;Archer&quot; joined the 4th Escort Group off Iceland on convoy support operations. She joined Convoy ONS 6 on 9 May and then Convoy ON 182 on 12 May, leaving these convoys on 14 May. On 21 May she joined Convoy HX 239. On 23 May, a Swordfish II of 819 Squadron sank &quot;U-752&quot; with a Rocket Spear, a new weapon, at . The thirteen survivors were rescued by . &quot;U-752&quot; was the first German U-boat to be sunk with rockets and only the second to be sunk by aircraft that operated from an escort aircraft carrier. &quot;Archer&quot; left Convoy HX 239 on 24 May. She then joined Convoy KMS 18B on 26 June and left that convoy on 3 July. She was then withdrawn from the 4th Escort Group to take part in exercises in the Irish Sea. Following these exercises, she was sent to the Bay of Biscay on anti-submarine patrol duty, but was withdrawn from this after a week due to a lack of U-boat activity and further defects. She arrived at Devonport on 27 July and work commenced the following day. &quot;Archer&quot; then sailed to the Clyde for engine repairs, arriving on 3 August.

It was found that &quot;Archer&quot; had extensive defects and she was decommissioned with effect from 6 November 1943. She was relegated to use as a stores ship at Gare Loch. In March 1944, &quot;Archer&quot; was towed to Loch Alsh where she was used as an accommodation ship until August when she was sent to Belfast for repairs to enable her to be used as an aircraft ferry ship. Repairs were to take seven and a half months.

&quot;Archer&quot; was the first of thirty-eight US-built converted C3 Escort Carriers turned over to Great Britain during the period 1941–1944, and one of five motor ships (the remainder were powered by geared turbines). Unlike the others, &quot;Archer&quot; was powered by four diesel engines instead of two.

===&quot;Empire Lagan&quot;===
On completion of the repairs on 15 March 1945, HMS &quot;Archer&quot; was transferred to the Ministry of War Transport and renamed &quot;Empire Lagan&quot;. She was used to ferry aircraft to the United Kingdom. Converted to a cargo ship, she operated under the management of the Blue Funnel Line and later A Holt &amp; Co. &quot;Empire Lagan&quot; was homeported in London. &quot;Empire Lagan&quot; returned to the US in Convoy UC 69, which departed Liverpool on 24 May 1945 and arrived at New York on 3 June 1945. She then sailed to Norfolk, Virginia.

===&quot;Archer&quot;===
On 9 January 1946, &quot;Empire Lagan&quot; was returned to the US Navy and renamed USS &quot;Archer&quot;. She was stricken from the US Navy register on 26 February 1946. MV &quot;Archer&quot; was laid up at Norfolk, Virginia. On 30 September 1947 she was sold to Mr J F Luley, New York for commercial service.

===&quot;Anna Salén&quot;===

In 1948 &quot;Archer&quot; was bought by Swedish businessman Sven Salén, and registered under the ownership of Rederi Pulp AB; her homeport was Stockholm. She was renamed &quot;Anna Salén&quot; and, after initial conversion into a bulk carrier at the Bethlehem Shipyard in Baltimore, took a load of coal from the US to Italy. By this time the owners had obtained a contract from the International Refugee Organisation to transport Displaced Persons from Europe to Australia and Canada. After arrival in Italy, &quot;Anna Salén&quot; was then converted to a passenger ship, with basic accommodation being built into the cargo holds and the superstructure being extended from the foc&#x27;s&#x27;le to the stern. There was accommodation for 1500 passengers in a single class. After the rebuild she was . Her maiden voyage as a passenger ship (22 May—21 June 1949) was from Naples, Italy, to Melbourne and Sydney. In December 1949, on her fourth voyage to Australia as &quot;Anna Salén&quot; she broke down in the Indian Ocean and limped into Aden, where her passengers were transferred to another ship, the &quot;Skaugum&quot;, to complete their voyage. After repairs were completed, &quot;Anna Salén&quot; resumed service. Her next two voyages, beginning on 20 June and 27 November 1950, departed from Bremerhaven bound for Australia. During the latter journey, one of the emigrants, Herr Gustav Kovaks, made a film about the voyage. It was later widely shown in Germany to give people a view of how the emigration process worked. &quot;Anna Salén&quot; arrived at Fremantle on 31 December 1950 and sailed for Melbourne later that day. It was realised that she couldn&#x27;t make Melbourne before the New Year, so for political reasons &quot;Anna Salén&quot; was ordered back to Fremantle where all 1,522 passengers were disembarked.

In the early to mid-1950s, &quot;Anna Salén&quot; was used between Europe, Saigon and Australia. On 8 September 1951, Ursula K. Le Guin and her brother Karl Kroeber sailed from Southampton to New York on &quot;Anna Salén,&quot; returning from a holiday in Europe. Later that year, on 26 December 1951, &quot;Anna Salén&quot; came across the Canadian coaster SS &quot;Mayfall&quot; flying a distress signal. She had encountered bad weather and run out of fuel. &quot;Anna Salén&quot; towed &quot;Mayfall&quot; to St Johns and then continued her journey to Halifax On 13 August 1952, &quot;Anna Salén&quot; collided with the Norwegian whaler SS &quot;Thorshovdi&quot; in the Pentland Firth. She put into Lyness with damage to her bows. On 2 July 1953 &quot;Anna Salén&quot; departed Bremen, West Germany to make a round trip to Quebec, Canada The journey took seven days. She continued to transport new migrants to Australia through 1954. She was sold in 1955 to a Greek buyer.

===&quot;Tasmania&quot;===
&quot;Anna Salén&quot; was bought by Compagnia Navigazione Tasmania SA, Piraeus and renamed &quot;Tasmania&quot;. She was placed under the management of Hellenic Mediterranean Lines and used on routes between French ports and Australia. and also on the Piraeus – Melbourne route of Hellenic Mediterranean Lines. In 1958, she was converted to a cargo ship of . She was sold to a Taiwanese buyer in 1961.

===&quot;Union Reliance&quot;===
&quot;Tasmania&quot; was bought by the China Union Lines of Taipei. She was renamed &quot;Union Reliance&quot;. She was used on routes between Taipei and the US. On 7 November 1961, she collided with the Norwegian tanker MV &quot;Berea&quot; in the Houston Ship Channel. As a result of the collision, &quot;Union Reliance&quot; caught fire and then ran aground. Twelve people aboard &quot;the Union Reliance&quot; were killed in the collision and subsequent fire. &quot;Union Reliance&quot; was abandoned by her owners. The wreck was removed on 9 November by the United States authorities and towed to Galveston, Texas China Union Lines refused to make payment for this, and filed a Petition for Exoneration from, or Limitation of Liability. The Court ordered that &quot;Union Reliance&quot; and her cargo be sold to pay off costs incurred by the United States authorities. On 12 January 1962, &quot;Union Reliance&quot; was sold for US$109,100 for scrap. She was scrapped at New Orleans in March 1962.

<text>The Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory (), officially named the Central Astronomical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Pulkovo, is the principal astronomical observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is located 19 km south of Saint Petersburg on Pulkovo Heights above sea level. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. It was formerly known as the Imperial Observatory at Pulkowo.

== Early years ==

The observatory was opened in 1839.
Originally, it was a brainchild of the German/Russian astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, who would become its first director (in 1861, his son Otto Wilhelm von Struve succeeded him). The architect was Alexander Bryullov. The observatory was equipped with state-of-the-art devices, one of them being the a aperture refractor, one of the largest refractors in the world at that time (see Great Refractor). In 1885, the observatory was equipped with refractor, which was the biggest usable refractor in the world, until the telescope at the Lick Observatory in California a few years later. Both were built by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons in Massachusetts.
The principal line of work of the observatory consisted of determination of coordinates of stars and astronomical constants, such as precession, nutation, aberration and refraction, and also discovering and measuring double stars. The observatory&#x27;s activities have also been connected to the geographical study of the territory of Russia and development of navigation. The star catalogues, containing the most precise positions of 374, and then 558 stars, were made for the years 1845, 1865, 1885, 1905 and 1930.

By the 50th anniversary of the Observatory, they had built an astrophysical laboratory with a mechanical workshop and installed the Europe&#x27;s largest refractor, (30 inch). Astrophysical research really gained momentum with the appointment of Feodor Bredikhin as a director of the Observatory in 1890 and transfer of Aristarkh Belopolsky from the Moscow Observatory, an expert in stellar spectroscopy and solar research. In 1923, they installed a big Littrow spectrograph, and in 1940 – a horizontal solar telescope, manufactured at a Leningrad factory. After having received an astrograph in 1894, the observatory began its work on astrophotography. In 1927, the Observatory received a zone astrograph and with its help the Russian astronomers catalogued the stars of the near-polar areas of the sky. Regular observation of movements of celestial poles began with the construction of the zenith telescope in 1904. In 1920, the Observatory started transmitting the exact time by radio signals. The observatory participated in the basic geodesic work, namely in measuring degrees of the arc of the meridian from the Danube to the Arctic Ocean (until 1851), and in triangulation of Spitsbergen in 1899–1901. Military geodesists and hydrographers used to work at the Observatory as interns. The Pulkovo Meridian, which passes through the center of the main building of the Observatory and is located at 30°19,6‘ east of Greenwich, was the point of departure for all former geographical maps of Russia.

In order to observe the southern stars that could not be seen on the observatory&#x27;s latitude, the scientists organized two observing locations. One of them was an astrophysical station in the Crimean town of Simeiz (Simeiz Observatory), which had been organized on the basis of a private observatory presented to the Pulkovo Observatory by an astronomy lover N. S. Maltsov in 1908. The other was an astrometric station in Mykolaiv – a former observatory of the Department of the Navy, (today&#x27;s Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory).

== Later history ==

During the siege of Leningrad (1941–1944), the Observatory became the target of fierce German air raids and artillery bombardment. All of the buildings were completely destroyed. Under dramatic circumstances, the main instruments were saved and stored safely in Leningrad, including the lens of the destroyed 30-inch refractor, and a significant part of the unique library with manuscripts and important works from the 15th to 19th century. On February 5, 1997, nearly 1,500 of the 3,852 books were destroyed by malicious arson and the rest of the library items were damaged by flames, smoke or water.

Even before the end of the war, the Soviet government made a decision to restore the Observatory. In 1946, it began the construction after having cleared the territory. In May 1954, the Observatory was re-opened, not only having been restored but considerably expanded in terms of instruments, employees and research subjects. New departments had been created, such as the Department of Radio Astronomy and Department of Instrument Making (with its own optical and mechanical workshop). The surviving old instruments were repaired, modernized and put into service once again. Also installed were new instruments, such as the refractor, a horizontal meridian device, a photographic polar telescope, a big zenith telescope, stellar interferometer, two solar telescopes, coronagraph, a big radio telescope and a variety of labware.
The 65 cm Zeiss refractor was originally intended as a gift from then Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler to the Italian Benito Mussolini, but it was not delivered and instead was recovered by the Soviet Union.

The Simeiz station became a part of the new Crimean Astrophysical Observatory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1945. They also built the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station and a laboratory in Blagoveshchensk. The observatory organized many expeditions for determining differences of longitudes, observing passages of Venus and solar eclipses, and studying astroclimate. In 1962, the Observatory sent an expedition to Chile to observe stars in the southern skies.

<doc id="982709" wikidata="Q7431132" url="?curid=982709" title="Scheme of work">
<text>A scheme of work is a kind of plan that outlines all the learning to be covered over a given period of time (usually a term or a whole school year).

 defines the structure and content of an academic course. It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work, each of a far shorter weeks&#x27; duration (e.g. two or three weeks). Each unit of work is then analysed out into teachable individual topics of even shorter duration (e.g. two hours or less).

Better schemes of work map out clearly how resources (e.g. books, equipment, time) and class activities (e.g. teacher-talk, group work, practicals, discussions) and assessment strategies (e.g. tests, quizzes, Q&amp;A, homework) will be used to teach each topic and assess students&#x27; progress in learning the material associated with each topic, unit and the scheme of work as a whole. As students progress through the scheme of work, there is an expectation that their perception of the interconnections between topics and units will be enhanced.

Schemes of work may include times and dates (deadlines) for delivering the different elements of the curriculum. Philosophically, this is linked to a belief that all students should be exposed to all elements of the curriculum such that those who are able to &quot;keep up&quot; (&quot;the best&quot; / elite) do not miss out on any content and can achieve the highest grades. This might be described as a &quot;traditionalist&quot; view.

There is a conflicting philosophical view that deadlines should be avoided and that each class should progress at its own pace: such that no student is &quot;left behind&quot;. Whilst the remaining students &quot;catch up&quot;, those students who understand quickly should be placed in a &quot;holding pattern&quot; full of puzzles and questions that challenge them to connect recent learning with longer-established learning (they may also be encouraged to spend a small amount of time enhancing their understanding by supporting teaching staff in unpicking underlying errors/questions of fellow students who have not grasped recent ideas as quickly). This view might be described as a &quot;Mastery&quot; approach. In mathematics teaching in England it is strongly supported by the Government-funded National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics based on research guided by the globally-exceptional performance of schools in Singapore and Shanghai.

== Curriculum ==
The scheme of work is usually an interpretation of a specification or syllabus and can be used as a guide throughout the course to monitor progress against the original plan. Schemes of work can be shared with students so that they have an overview of their course.

The ultimate source of the specification or syllabus is a curriculum. Curricula are typically defined by Government and hence by law and/or regulation. Accordingly, each country has its own (though some countries choose to adopt curricula defined by other countries).

In generating a scheme of work, it is vital to have detailed regard to the legally-required curriculum of the country in which the scheme of work is to be delivered. These are typically defined, in detail, by subject. Understanding the subtleties and nuances of their presentation is of vital importance when defining the most useful schemes of work.

=== England ===
For maintained schools and exam boards in England, the National Curriculum is set by Department for Education such that all children growing up in England have a broadly similar education.

The curriculum for Primary education (ages 4/5 to 11) and Secondary education (ages 11 to 18) in England is divided into five Key Stages. Key stages 1 and 2 are delivered at Primary Schools. Key Stages 3, 4 and 5 are delivered at Secondary Schools.

==== England - Mathematics ====

===== English Primary Schools: Key Stages 1 &amp; 2 [ages 5 to 11] =====
The expectations for delivering the National Curriculum for mathematics in England at Key Stages 1 and 2 are tightly defined with clear time-linked objectives. The Department for Education has provided an initial annual scheme of work (or set of expectations) for each school/academic year from Year 1 (age 5/6) to and including Year 6 (age 10/11). This does not specify the order of teaching each topic within each year; but does provide guidance and does set out the expectations of what is to be taught and learned by the end of each year of students&#x27; primary education.

===== English Secondary Schools: Key Stages 3 and 4 [ages 11 to 16] =====
The National Curriculum for mathematics in England is also tightly defined at Key Stages 3 and 4. However, each individual English school&#x27;s mathematics department is given greater freedom to decide when and how to deliver the content. By contrast to the national curriculum for England&#x27;s primary schools, there are no annual expectations. Instead, guidance is set by reference to what is to be taught and learned by the end of Key Stage 3 [the end of year 9 (ages 13/14)] and by the end of Key Stage 4 [the end of year 11 (ages 15/16)].

It is notable that the curriculum for Key Stage 4 is intended by the Department for Education to examine all learning from Key Stages 1 to 4. In particular, topics listed in Key Stage 3 explicitly form part of the curriculum for Key Stage 4 (such that the foundations of earlier learning are reinforced whilst building upon them). Accordingly, students who have struggled with the harder-to-understand elements in the past are given the opportunity to master the Key Stage 3 content whilst others build higher, in parallel.

===== English Secondary Schools: GCSEs [typically age 15/16+] =====
It is mandatory in England for students to have taken a GCSE in mathematics by the year of their sixteenth birthday.

It is notable that the subject content agreed between the Department of Education and The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) [the exam board regulator for GCSEs, AS-Levels and A-Levels] is highlighted in subtly different ways to the subject content of the national curriculum for Key Stage 4.

The latter features two levels of expectation (plain text versus {bold and &#x27;braces&#x27;}); the former features three (plain text, underlined text and bold text). The subtly of the distinction enabled more perceptive students, parents and educators to determine (or speculate about) the way in which content is (or should be) distributed between the two different sets of GCSE mathematics examinations (Foundation and Higher): these two sets overlap (suggesting the underlined topics exist in the intersection between the two sets of topics).

It is also notable that the curriculum for GCSE is intended by the Department for Education to examine all learning from Key Stages 1 to 4. In particular, topics listed in Key Stage 3 explicitly form part of the curriculum for Key Stage 4 and the GCSE (such that the foundations of earlier learning are reinforced whilst building upon them). Accordingly, students who have struggled with the harder-to-understand elements in the past are given the opportunity to master the Key Stage 3 content whilst others build higher, in parallel.

===== English Secondary Schools: AS and A-Levels [typically age 17+] =====
AS and A-Levels in mathematics are not mandatory.

Accordingly, there is no national curriculum for AS and A-Level mathematics in England. However, there is agreed subject content required by the Department for Education for AS and A level specifications in mathematics.

<text>Global Unions or Council of Global Unions is a website, which is jointly owned and managed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD, and ten global union federations (GUFs).

== Formation ==
In November 2006, two international union organizations were created, the ITUC and the Council of Global Unions that emerged from a reorganization of the international trade union movement (which was divided because of post-war divisions). ITUC is the result of the breakup of both the WCL and ICFTU for the purposes of uniting under one organisation. The Council of Global Unions was created at the first meeting of ITUC and is a body involving the global union federations which represent their respective sectors at the international trade union level, ITUC, and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD.

The Council of Global Unions (CGU) held its inaugural meeting in Brussels, 9–10 January 2007. All GUFs, with the exception of the International Metalworkers&#x27; Federation, as well as TUAC, became members of the Council and signed the agreement.

== Responsibilities ==
The CGU was created to encourage closer co-operation among global unions in order to act more effectively at the international level to build a more favourable, enabling environment for organising and collective bargaining. Although its work has policy implications, it was not established to make policy. That is the responsibility of the organisations that constitute the CGU.

Although Global Unions are described as &#x27;global&#x27;, this represents more an &quot;aspiration than a reality since they are more accurately described as international bodies with wide coverage that are &#x27;globalising. Historically, they have built outwards from their European bases in an attempt to include unions in other regions and are still trying to extend their coverage to every country where unions are found.

<text>Jim Rayburn, Jr (July 21, 1909 – December 11, 1970) was an American ordained Presbyterian minister and the founder of Young Life.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Marshalltown, Iowa to James Chalmers Rayburn, Sr. (an evangelist for the Presbyterian Church), and Elna Beck Rayburn. Rayburn was the oldest of four sons and grew up in Newton, Kansas. His younger brother, Robert, became the founding president of both Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary.

Rayburn graduated from Kansas State University in 1941 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mineralogy. In 1936, Rayburn began his seminary education at Dallas Theological Seminary. While there, he was significantly influenced by the seminary&#x27;s founder, Lewis Sperry Chafer.

==Career==
Rayburn founded Young Life (originally known as Young Life Campaign), a Christian youth organization, after earning his master&#x27;s degree. Rayburn left the presidency of Young Life in 1964.

He was a pioneer in the field of evangelism and was admired by many of the leading Christians of his day. He was known for his ability to communicate the gospel and his passion for Christ. Rayburn&#x27;s personal journals were published in 2008 as &quot;The Diaries of Jim Rayburn&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1932, Rayburn married Helen Maxine Stanley. The couple had three children. Maxine Rayburn died in 1997. He died on December 11, 1970, at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<doc id="982741" wikidata="Q7408379" url="?curid=982741" title="Sam and Amanda Fowler">
<text>Sam Fowler and Amanda Cory are fictional characters from the American soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. Sam was played by Robert Kelker-Kelly, Danny Markel, and Brian Lane Green. Amanda was played by Sandra Ferguson, Christine Tucci, and Laura Moss. The couple were a popular super couple for fans during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Their love affair lasted from 1987, shortly after their first meeting, until 1990. They remarried in 1991 and the second try lasted until early 1993 when it ended in divorce.

==History==
Amanda Cory is the only biological child of wealthy publisher Mac (Douglass Watson) and Rachel Cory (Victoria Wyndham). She had a rocky childhood with her parents constantly splitting up, among other events. She still led a life of privilege and enjoyed a close bond with her family.

In 1987, Amanda returned to Bay City from Paris, where she was attending school. At the same time, a man named Sam Fowler came to town. He was there to find his half-brother, Mitch Blake (William Gray Espy), who happened to be the biological father of Amanda&#x27;s younger brother, Matthew. Sam was a budding artist and needed a place to stay.

When Amanda returned to town, she was informed by her brother that their parents were throwing a cotillion for her. She was angry as she did not want to have people perceive her as spoiled, rich, or glamorous. When Amanda told Rachel that she didn&#x27;t want the party (mere hours before it was to be held), Rachel was crushed because all she wanted was to give Amanda the perks that she was denied when she grew up poor. Rachel&#x27;s mother Ada (Constance Ford) understood Rachel&#x27;s sadness but she implored her to understand her daughter&#x27;s right to have a say on events that impacted her life. Amanda did not want to hurt her mother, however, and showed up at the cotillion on time, in full debutante regalia. Mitch had the idea to have Sam work as a valet at Amanda&#x27;s party to earn some money. Mitch had to promise his fiancée Felicia Gallant (Linda Dano) that Mac was not to know that Sam was related to him, due to previous issues between the Cory family and him.

When Amanda first showed up at the Cory mansion, Sam mistook Amanda for another valet, and was fairly bossy toward her. Amanda just wanted to be treated like any other person, so she did not tell him who her parents were, and since he did not see her at the debutante ball, he remained blissfully unaware. She made up this persona called &quot;Mandy Ashton&quot; and started working on &quot;Brava Magazine&quot; at Cory Publishing, her father&#x27;s company. She made her father promise not to tell anyone who she was, and that he could only talk about it to people who knew (such as her mother, and her best friend Julie Ann). He agreed, under the guise that she did not want to be treated differently due to who her parents were. Mac also hired Sam as a cover art designer, with Felicia pulling some strings with Rachel to get him the job. &quot;Mandy&quot; buddied up to Sam and eventually started working as his assistant. Over time, they fell in love. Sam&#x27;s friend Joyce came to break them up but was unsuccessful.

Eventually, however, Sam found out, fired &quot;Mandy&quot;, and became very resentful toward Amanda; this stemmed from Sam&#x27;s long animosity against anyone who had money. After Amanda pleaded with him that she was still the same person he fell in love with, he took her back. Amanda lost her virginity to Sam and later found out that she was pregnant with his child. At first she did not tell him, as she found out when they were estranged, but she eventually told him the truth when they reconciled. While he had mixed feelings, he realized that he was going to love this baby with all of his heart.

Mac Cory, who did not know that Sam was related to Mitch, was finally let in on the information. Liz Matthews (Irene Dailey), who had come back to town and resumed secretarial duties for Mac, found Sam&#x27;s file and told Mac that his next of kin was Mitch and that they were brothers. Mac saw red and wanted to fire Sam, and was very disillusioned that his wife would also lie about the situation (she had been sworn to secrecy by Felicia, and understood that she would be more accepting of Sam than Mac would). After a while, however, Mac&#x27;s emotions cooled and he grew to accept Sam, or as much as Mac knew how. With everyone in the know, Sam and Amanda got engaged and planned a wedding.

Sam and Mitch&#x27;s mother Loretta (Rosemary Murphy) came to town, and her big secret was revealed fairly early: she was a kleptomaniac. When Loretta stole a wedding present to give to Amanda, Sam confronted her on his wedding day and ordered her to take it back. When Loretta denied that she ever stole anything, Sam yelled at her and said he was fed up with having such a horrible mother. Shocked, Loretta slapped him and walked out. Sam took matters into his own hands and went to Chicago, where his mother stole the present, with the intent of returning it. When he got there, however, he was accused of thieving the item. Sam, pushed over the edge, punched the security guard and was arrested. Amanda did not know what was going on and waited for Sam at the chapel. She was heartbroken when he didn&#x27;t show up, but believed, deep down in her heart, that he would not do this to her without a good reason. Mac told everyone that he knew that Sam would break her heart the whole time, because he was related to Mitch. Squabbling ensued, with Ada finally ordering everyone to be quiet. Loretta admitted that they had a fight, and told the Corys what it involved.

Sam was freed from the jail and raced back to town, only to find that he was too late. He drove up to the Cory mansion and spied on the squabbling guests, finally deciding on climbing up to Amanda&#x27;s window. She started to yell at him for missing their important day, but as soon as he explained, Amanda hugged him and knew their love was real. They decided to go back to the church and the two held a late-night wedding.

They wed shortly before Amanda gave birth to her only child, Alexandra &quot;Alli&quot; Fowler (named after Mac&#x27;s mother). Soon after, Mac&#x27;s company. Cory Publishing, became victim of a hostile takeover attempt by a rival company, Bennett Publishing. As Cory Publishing fought back, Evan Bates (Charles Grant) came to town, and Mac&#x27;s estranged oldest daughter, Iris Wheeler (Carmen Duncan) also returned to town, and seemed to help bring an end to the takeover. Amanda grew close to Evan as the two worked together, and Evan even risked his neck to rescue Amanda from a dangerous situation. She also welcomed her seemingly reformed sister into her life, as she was relatively unfamiliar with the previous bitter rivalry between Iris and Rachel, and Rachel remained suspicious.

It later turned out that Iris and Evan had been working together. Evan Bates was actually Evan Frame, son of Janice Frame, whom had attempted to marry and murder Mac for his money, but was killed by Rachel in self-defense, fueling Evan&#x27;s desire for revenge. And Iris turned out to be the secret CEO of Bennett Publishing, having set the whole thing up to play the hero and win Mac over. Amanda was horrified at both revelations and cut both Iris and Evan out of her life, but eventually reconciled with Evan.

Amanda, who was always very close to her father, was devastated when he died of a heart attack. While Amanda and Sam managed to get through the tough times together, their marriage became really strained when Sam found out she was sleeping with Evan. Initially it seemed like they&#x27;d work things out but Evan, started setting up circumstances to make it seem like Sam was trying to hurt or kill Amanda, causing her to kick him out. Eventually he fought back and proved Evan set them up, and Amanda again cut Evan out her life. However the damage between her and Sam was done, and they were divorced, and Sam began a relationship with Russ Matthew&#x27;s (David Bailey) daughter, Olivia (Allison Hosiak). Eventually, he broke up with her, and reconciled with Amanda, and they were remarried. However, it eventually all fell apart again, as Sam left Amanda to focus on his new music career.

Amanda began writing a biography on Senator Grant Harrison (Mark Pinter), and after his marriage to Vicky Hudson (Jensen Buchanan) fell apart, the two of them began a romantic relationship. Then Evan Frame came back to town. He tried to start up a relationship, but Amanda wasn&#x27;t interested in cheating on her fiance. When Amanda and Evan were in a car accident together, Grant assumed she&#x27;d been unfaithful, but married her while she was still recovering. She spent months in a wheelchair with Grant calling all the shots, but as soon as she could walk again and realized what a skunk her husband was, she divorced him. When his mother showed up in town pretending to be Rachel, Amanda left, feeling like her mother didn&#x27;t want her around.

Amanda returned a few months later, determined to break her mother and Carl up. She pretended to be a woman named &quot;Hadley Prescott&quot;, who was having an affair with Amanda. Eventually she was found out, but not before developing feelings for IAD officer Neil Johansen, co-owner of the Herald Jake McKinnon (Matt had given Amanda his half), and carpenter-turned-doctor Shane Roberts. After Carl was presumed dead, Amanda put her anger with Carl behind her to support her mother.

Amanda began a romantic relationship with Frank Cameron, a convict-turned-FBI-agent who was sent to infiltrate the Cory household. Despite misgivings about his past, Amanda fell in love with Cameron, who she discovered was really Cameron Sinclair, and the two began to plan their future together, until Amanda discovered that while she and Gary were fighting for their lives, Cameron and Josie were making love on the beach. She was able to forgive him for the affair, and the two began planning for their wedding. On the day of the ceremony, Amanda learned that Josie was pregnant with Cameron&#x27;s baby, and he&#x27;d been lying to her all along. She called off the ceremony, then spent a time being stalked by Jordan Stark, who knew that Amanda was the reincarnation of his dead wife, Amalie Kittridge. Cameron was instrumental in saving her, and the two ended up getting married after all.</text><links>

<text>British Energy was the UK&#x27;s largest electricity generation company by volume, before being taken over by Électricité de France (EDF) in 2009. British Energy operated eight former UK state-owned nuclear power stations and one coal-fired power station.

From 1 July 2010 the rebranding of British Energy locations and communications to EDF Energy commenced as part of its incorporation into the parent group, following around 17 months of dual branding. This was concluded with the renaming of the operating company from &quot;British Energy Generation Limited&quot; to &quot;EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited&quot; on 1 July 2011.

==Structure==
In 2009, the British Energy subsidiary group was structured accordingly:
* British Energy Group plc: holding company, a wholly owned subsidiary of EDF S.A.
** British Energy Generation Ltd: dominant subsidiary; owned and ran the large power stations, was licensed to operate nuclear power stations.
** District Energy Ltd: owned four modern 10MWe natural gas-fuelled power plants.
** British Energy Renewables Ltd: participated in a small number of renewable power projects.
** Lewis Wind Power Ltd: joint venture with AMEC to develop a proposed wind farm on the Isle of Lewis.

==History==
===Early history and development===
British Energy was established and registered in Scotland in 1995 to operate the eight most modern nuclear power plants in the UK. It took the two Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) plants from Scottish Nuclear and five AGR and a sole pressurised water reactor (PWR) plant from Nuclear Electric. The residual Magnox power stations from these two companies were transferred to Magnox Electric which later became the generation division of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. The company was privatised in 1996.

It retained major technical offices at Barnwood, formerly the HQ of Nuclear Electric, and Peel Park, formerly the HQ of Scottish Nuclear.

In June 1999, in an attempt to become an integrated generating and retail company, British Energy bought the retail electricity and gas supplier SWALEC based in Wales, providing 6% of the England and Wales electricity supply market. However it was unable to purchase another retailer at a reasonable cost to create a widespread retail presence, so sold SWALEC a few months later to Scottish and Southern Energy.

British Energy bought the 2,000MWe Eggborough coal fired station from National Power in 2000, to provide a more flexible power production facility and reduce penalty charge risks from the New Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March 2001. Despite this, the new arrangements led to a significantly lower electricity price for inflexible base load power stations such as British Energy had. The purchase of Eggborough occurred at the peak of the market for power stations, and in 2002, the value of the station was written down by half.

In 2001, the company was the major partner in taking on an operating lease to become the operator of Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Ontario, Canada. The resultant subsidiary was called Bruce Power. As part of financial re-structuring, Bruce Power was sold to a consortium of Canadian investors in February 2003.
In 2007, British Energy entered into a seven-year partnership agreement with Doosan Babcock Energy to provide technical, engineering and operational support across all British Energy sites. The agreement was at the time held to be potentially worth around £550million, bringing up to 800 jobs into Scotland and the rest of the UK.

===Financial difficulties===
The company faced financial trouble from 2002, when it first approached the British government for financial aid. This followed a slump in wholesale energy prices, a failure to obtain relaxations on the Climate Change Levy, and renegotiations of its back-end fuel costs with BNFL, as well as issues with a number of its reactors (resulting in much capacity being offline during critical periods of the company financial crisis) and a failure to complete a timely sale of its joint-venture share in AmerGen. Parties to the resulting talks included bondholders, significant but unsecured creditors, power purchase agreement counterparties, and a group of secured creditors known as the Eggborough banks; who had provided financing for the purchase of the Eggborough coal-fired power plant in 2000.

The plan that resulted from these talks nearly eliminated any equity interest of existing stockholders; the firm&#x27;s creditors waived over £1billion of debts in return for control of the company. Shareholders received only 2.5% of the shares of the new company.

On 22 September 2004 the UK government&#x27;s investment of over £3billion in the restructured firm was approved by the European Commission. On 24 September the company was reclassified as a public body in what the Office for National Statistics described as a reflection of &quot;the control that can be exercised by government over British Energy&quot;. This move was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as a de facto nationalisation of the group.

===Restructuring===
Under the British Government&#x27;s restructuring programme the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF) acted as a creditor and liability receiver for British Energy Group. In return, a mechanism was put in place whereby NLF could carry out a cash sweep of the organisation and claim 65% of British Energy&#x27;s available cash flow each year, on top of a fixed annual contribution. British Energy was allowed to borrow up to £700M under the arrangements, with the NLF providing £275M.

The British Government also assumed British Energy nuclear fuel liabilities worth between £150M and £200M p.a. over ten years. These fuel liabilities extended until 2086.

Despite its financial problems and government help with its fuel liabilities, British Energy&#x27;s Chief Executive claimed, on 20 June 2006, that nuclear power stations would be economically viable without government guarantee or subsidy if the operation of the energy market was changed.

The British Government&#x27;s interest in British Energy at this time was managed by the Shareholder Executive on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).

The restructuring of British Energy was subject to three National Audit Office reports; in May 1998, February 2004 and March 2006.

In 2007, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee reported on the restructuring. They noted that the taxpayer had been left to underwrite large liabilities, revalued at £5.3billion, while creditors who would have received little on liquidation received bonds and shares worth £3.9billion in 2006.

===Disposal of government interest===
In July 2006, the government announced that they were considering selling part of their interest in British Energy. On 30 May 2007, it was announced that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would instruct the Nuclear Liabilities Fund to sell up to approximately 450 million shares, representing around 28% of the Fund&#x27;s interest in British Energy. The Fund&#x27;s cash sweep percentage would be reduced from around 64% to approximately 36% following the sale. Revenue from the sale was used to diversify the Nuclear Liabilities Fund&#x27;s assets.

===Acquisition by EDF===
On 24 September 2008, it was announced that Électricité de France (EDF), the state owned French energy company, had agreed a takeover of the company, paying £12.5billion.
Centrica purchased a 20% share of British Energy from EDF in August 2009.

On 1 April 2010, EDF transferred the coal-fired Eggborough power station to the plant&#x27;s bondholders as per an earlier agreement, and in compliance with commitments made to the European Commission when agreeing the acquisition of British Energy.

==Operations==
At the time of the EDF acquisition, British Energy operated the following power stations:

In 2005, British Energy announced a ten-year life extension at Dungeness B, that would see the station continue operating until 2018, and in 2007 announced a five-year life extension of Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B until 2016.

Following an outage in 2006 when an increase in creep-induced defect in boiler tubes was observed, Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B were restricted to about 70% of normal output from 2007 and operated at reduced boiler outlet temperatures. After recovery, operation at 80% of the nominal output was allowed.

In December 2009, it was announced that new stations would be built at existing land owned around Sizewell and Hinkley Point stations. Dungeness was considered but was thought to be a poor choice for a new build.

<doc id="982771" wikidata="Q5299992" url="?curid=982771" title="Double coset">
<text>In group theory, a field of mathematics, a double coset is a collection of group elements which are equivalent under the symmetries coming from two subgroups, generalizing the notion of a single coset. 

==Definition==
Let be a group, and let and be subgroups. Let act on by left multiplication and let act on by right multiplication. For each in , the -double coset of is the set
:formula_1
When , this is called the -double coset of . Equivalently, is the equivalence class of under the equivalence relation
: if and only if there exist in and in such that .
The set of all formula_2-double cosets is denoted by formula_3

== Properties ==

Suppose that is a group with subgroups and acting by left and right multiplication, respectively. The -double cosets of may be equivalently described as orbits for the product group acting on by . Many of the basic properties of double cosets follow immediately from the fact that they are orbits. However, because is a group and and are subgroups acting by multiplication, double cosets are more structured than orbits of arbitrary group actions, and they have additional properties that are false for more general actions.

* Two double cosets and are either disjoint or identical.
* is the disjoint union of its double cosets.
* There is a one-to-one correspondence between the two double coset spaces and given by identifying with .
* If , then . If , then .
* A double coset is a union of right cosets of and left cosets of ; specifically,
*:formula_4
* The set of -double cosets is in bijection with the orbits , and also with the orbits under the mappings formula_5 and formula_6 respectively.
* If is normal, then is a group, and the right action of on this group factors through the right action of . It follows that . Similarly, if is normal, then .
* If is a normal subgroup of , then the -double cosets are in one-to-one correspondence with the left (and right) -cosets.
* Consider as the union of a -orbit of right -cosets. The stabilizer of the right -coset with respect to the right action of is . Similarly, the stabilizer of the left -coset with respect to the left action of is .
* It follows that the number of right cosets of contained in is the index and the number of left cosets of contained in is the index . Therefore
*:formula_7
*If , , and are finite, then it also follows that
*:formula_8
* Fix in , and let denote the double stabilizer }. Then the double stabilizer is a subgroup of .
* Because is a group, for each in there is precisely one in such that , namely ; however, may not be in . Similarly, for each in there is precisely one in such that , but may not be in . The double stabilizer therefore has the descriptions
*:formula_9
* (Orbit–stabilizer theorem) There is a bijection between and under which corresponds to . It follows that if , , and are finite, then
*:formula_10
* (Cauchy–Frobenius lemma) Let denote the elements fixed by the action of . Then
*:formula_11
* In particular, if , , and are finite, then the number of double cosets equals the average number of points fixed per pair of group elements.

There is an equivalent description of double cosets in terms of single cosets. Let and both act by right multiplication on . Then acts by left multiplication on the product of coset spaces . The orbits of this action are in one-to-one correspondence with . This correspondence identifies with the double coset . Briefly, this is because every -orbit admits representatives of the form , and the representative is determined only up to left multiplication by an element of . Similarly, acts by right multiplication on , and the orbits of this action are in one-to-one correspondence with the double cosets . Conceptually, this identifies the double coset space with the space of relative configurations of an -coset and a -coset. Additionally, this construction generalizes to the case of any number of subgroups. Given subgroups , the space of -multicosets is the set of -orbits of .

The analog of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem for double cosets is false. This means that the size of a double coset need not divide the order of . For example, let be the symmetric group on three letters, and let and be the cyclic subgroups generated by the transpositions and , respectively. If denotes the identity permutation, then
:formula_12
This has four elements, and four does not divide six, the order of . It is also false that different double cosets have the same size. Continuing the same example,
:formula_13
which has two elements, not four.

However, suppose that is normal. As noted earlier, in this case the double coset space equals the left coset space . Similarly, if is normal, then is the right coset space . Standard results about left and right coset spaces then imply the following facts.

* for all in . That is, all double cosets have the same cardinality.
* If is finite, then . In particular, and divide .

== Examples ==

* Let be the symmetric group, considered as permutations of the set }. Consider the subgroup which stabilizes . Then consists of two double cosets. One of these is , and the other is for any permutation which does not fix . This is contrasted with , which has formula_14 elements formula_15, where each formula_16.
* Let be the group , and let be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices. The double coset space is the Bruhat decomposition of . The double cosets are exactly , where ranges over all n-by-n permutation matrices. For instance, if , then
*:formula_17

== Products in the free abelian group on the set of double cosets ==

Suppose that is a group and that , , and are subgroups. Under certain finiteness conditions, there is a product on the free abelian group generated by the - and -double cosets with values in the free abelian group generated by the -double cosets. This means there is a bilinear function
:formula_18

Assume for simplicity that is finite. To define the product, reinterpret these free abelian groups in terms of the group algebra of as follows. Every element of has the form
:formula_19
where is a set of integers indexed by the elements of . This element may be interpreted as a -valued function on , specifically, . This function may be pulled back along the projection which sends to the double coset . This results in a function . By the way in which this function was constructed, it is left invariant under and right invariant under . The corresponding element of the group algebra is
:formula_20
and this element is invariant under left multiplication by and right multiplication by . Conceptually, this element is obtained by replacing by the elements it contains, and the finiteness of ensures that the sum is still finite. Conversely, every element of which is left invariant under and right invariant under is the pullback of a function on . Parallel statements are true for and .

When elements of , , and are interpreted as invariant elements of , then the product whose existence was asserted above is precisely the multiplication in . Indeed, it is trivial to check that the product of a left--invariant element and a right--invariant element continues to be left--invariant and right--invariant. The bilinearity of the product follows immediately from the bilinearity of multiplication in . It also follows that if is a fourth subgroup of , then the product of -, -, and -double cosets is associative. Because the product in corresponds to convolution of functions on , this product is sometimes called the convolution product.

An important special case is when . In this case, the product is a bilinear function
:formula_21
This product turns into an associative ring whose identity element is the class of the trivial double coset . In general, this ring is non-commutative. For example, if , then the ring is the group algebra , and a group algebra is a commutative ring if and only if the underlying group is abelian.

If is normal, so that the -double cosets are the same as the elements of the quotient group , then the product on is the product in the group algebra . In particular, it is the usual convolution of functions on . In this case, the ring is commutative if and only if is abelian, or equivalently, if and only if contains the commutator subgroup of .

If is not normal, then may be commutative even if is non-abelian. A classical example is the product of two Hecke operators. This is the product in the Hecke algebra, which is commutative even though the group is the modular group, which is non-abelian, and the subgroup is an arithmetic subgroup and in particular does not contain the commutator subgroup. Commutativity of the convolution product is closely tied to Gelfand pairs.

When the group is a topological group, it is possible to weaken the assumption that the number of left and right cosets in each double coset is finite. The group algebra is replaced by an algebra of functions such as or , and the sums are replaced by integrals. The product still corresponds to convolution. For instance, this happens for the Hecke algebra of a locally compact group.

== Applications ==

When a group formula_22 has a transitive group action on a set formula_23, computing certain double coset decompositions of formula_22 reveals extra information about structure of the action of formula_22 on formula_26. Specifically, if formula_27 is the stabilizer subgroup of some element formula_28, then formula_22 decomposes as exactly two double cosets of formula_30 if and only if formula_22 acts transitively on the set of distinct pairs of formula_23. See 2-transitive groups for more information about this action.

Double cosets are important in connection with representation theory, when a representation of is used to construct an induced representation of , which is then restricted to . The corresponding double coset structure carries information about how the resulting representation decomposes. In the case of finite groups, this is Mackey&#x27;s decomposition theorem.

They are also important in functional analysis, where in some important cases functions left-invariant and right-invariant by a subgroup can form a commutative ring under convolution: see Gelfand pair.

In geometry, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space , where is a reductive Lie group, is a closed subgroup, and is a discrete subgroup (of ) that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space .

In number theory, the Hecke algebra corresponding to a congruence subgroup of the modular group is spanned by elements of the double coset space formula_33; the algebra structure is that acquired from the multiplication of double cosets described above. Of particular importance are the Hecke operators formula_34 corresponding to the double cosets formula_35 or formula_36, where formula_37 (these have different properties depending on whether and are coprime or not), and the diamond operators formula_38 given by the double cosets formula_39 where formula_40 and we require formula_41 (the choice of does not affect the answer).

<text>Interstate 22 (I-22) is a Interstate Highway in the US states of Mississippi and Alabama, connecting I-269 near Byhalia, Mississippi, to I-65 near Birmingham, Alabama. I-22 is also Corridor X of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Designated in 2012, I-22 follows the route of older U.S. Route 78 (US 78) and is concurrent with the route for all but its eastern most . The freeway mainly spans rural areas and passes numerous small towns along its route, including Fulton, Tupelo, New Albany, and Holly Springs in Mississippi and Jasper, Winfield, and Hamilton in Alabama.

I-22 was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards to close a gap in the Interstate Highway System, allowing for more direct connections between cities in the southeast with cities in the central part of the country. I-22 indirectly connects I-240, I-40, I-55, and I-69 in the Memphis metropolitan area via US 78 and I-269, and indirectly connects with I-459, I-20, and I-59 in the Birmingham metropolitan area via I-65.

I-22 serves as a connection between Birmingham and suburban Memphis, filling in a gap in the Interstate Highway System. It also fills a gap that provides freeway passage between Atlanta and Oklahoma City. It begins at an interchange with I-269 at Byhalia, Mississippi, approximately from downtown Memphis and travels southeast across northern Mississippi and Alabama, before ending at an interchange with I-65 approximately north of downtown Birmingham, Alabama.

===Mississippi===

I-22 begins at a cloverleaf interchange with I-269 just west of Byhalia in DeSoto County in northwestern Mississippi in the far southeastern suburbs of Memphis. It is concurrent with US 78, which is a four-lane freeway through its entire length in Mississippi and the exit numbers for its overlap with I-22 remain based on its mileage. I-22/US 78 then continues southeastward into Marshall County parallel to Mississippi Highway 178 (MS 178; the former alignment of US 78) with latter route providing local access to small towns along the route. The first major community the freeway passes is Holly Springs, the county seat of Marshall County. I-22/US 78 bypasses the city to the southwest; exits 26 (Landfill Road) and 30 (MS 4/MS 7) provide access to the city. Continuing southeastward, the freeway than passes through the Holly Springs National Forest and into Benton County passing near several small towns that are accessible through interchanges with or connecting to MS 178. Upon exiting the forest into Union County, I-22/US 78 approaches the county seat of New Albany before passing just southwest of it with four exits (60, 61, 63, and 64) providing direct access to the city. MS 30 shares a brief concurrency with I-22/US 78 between exits 61 and 64 with the latter exit being at MS 15. To the southeast of the city near the town of Sherman in Pontotoc County, I-22/US 78 has a second brief concurrency with MS 9 starting between the exits 73 and 76. Exit 73 is a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange, the first non-diamond interchange on the freeway since its starting point at I-269, a distance of about . I-22/US 78 then enters Lee County and passes north of Tupelo, its county seat, with five exits (81, 82, 85, 86, and 87) connecting to the city, including an interchange with MS 178 (exit 81) northwest of Tupelo along with interchanges with the Natchez Trace Parkway (exit 85) and US 45/Corridor V (exit 86) north of the city with Corridor V becoming concurrent with I-22/US 78. The freeway then turns eastward and has an interchange with MS 371 north of Mooreville before crossing into Itawamba County. I-22/US 78/Corridor V then has an interchange with MS 178 (to MS 363) in Peppertown before crossing the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway to its next interchange with South Adams Street (exit 104), which provides access to the community of Fulton, the county seat. MS 25 becomes concurrent with I-22/US 78/Corridor V and heads eastward along the route at the exit as well. A weigh station is also just beyond the exit. One exit later (108), MS 25 and Corridor V branch off and head northward. I-22/US 78 then turns east-southeastward with one final interchange (exit 113) with MS 23 south of Tremont before crossing into Alabama.

===Alabama===

Still a four-lane freeway, I-22/US 78 (internally designated as State Route 4, or SR 4) enters into northwestern Alabama northwest of Bexar in Marion County and heads east-southeastward. Its first interchange (exit 3) is located just east of town at County Route 33 (CR 33). I-22/US 78/SR 4&#x27;s next four exits (7, 11, 14, and 16) serve the city of Hamilton, the county seat. The freeway curls around the southwest side of the city. Exit 7 gives I-22/US 78/SR 4 access to SR 19 and SR 74, exit 11 is an interchange with SR 17 and exit 16 is an interchange with US 43/US 278/SR 171. The final exit also provides access to the community of Guin. I-22/US 78 then passes south of Brilliant which is accessible by interchanges with SR 44 (exit 26, which also serves the town of Twin and the city of Guin) and SR 129 (exit 30, which also serves the community of Winfield). An interchange with SR 233 (exit 34) serves the community of Glen Allen before I-22/US 78/SR 4 crosses into Walker County. Its next interchange, SR 13 (exit 39), serves the communities of Eldridge and Natural Bridge. Carbon Hill is served by CR 11 (exit 46, which also serves Nauvoo) and SR 118 (exit 52; former US 78 Alternate). I-22/US 78/SR 4 then widens to six lanes and has an unsigned interchange (exit 53) with future SR 102. I-22/US 78/SR 4 then passes just south of Jasper, the county seat, which is served by four exits (57, 61, 63, and 65) with SR 118, SR 69, SR 269, and Industrial Parkway. The freeway narrows to four lanes at exit 57 but expands back to six lanes at exit 63. The next three exits (70, 72, and 78) serve Cordova, Parrish, Dora, Sumiton, Wyatt, and Quinton. I-22/US 78/SR 4 then enters Jefferson County and has an interchange with CR 45 (exit 81), which serves West Jefferson. Its next interchange is with SR 5 (exit 85); the exit marks the end of the concurrency with US 78/SR 4 which branches off and becomes concurrent with SR 5 south, which serves as a local road for Graysville and the northwestern suburbs of Birmingham. Between exits 85 and 87 (CR 112) is the future site of the interchange with I-222 (exit 86), which would connect I-22 to the proposed I-422 (Corridor X-1/Birmingham Northern Beltline). I-22 than passes through Coalburg before ending at an interchange with I-65 (unsigned exits 95A and 95B) approximately north of downtown Birmingham. Ramp stubs for an additional interchange (future exit 95C) just beyond I-65 to US 31 have been made, but construction on this won&#x27;t begin until at least 2030.

==History==
The concept of a Memphis-to-Birmingham expressway was discussed as early as the 1950s but did not move beyond talk for more than 20 years.

When studies for I-22 began, the highway was proposed to continue west to downtown Memphis, Tennessee, and end at I-240 and I-69. Several other proposals were also considered. One took I-22 along I-269 to I-55/I-69 and another took it along Crump Boulevard to end at I-55, but those plans never materialized.

The part of I-22 just east of Fulton, Mississippi, was approved by Congress as &quot;Corridor X&quot; in 1978, as a part of the ADHS, and parts of I-22 have been under construction ever since. Corridor X was also designated as &quot;High Priority Corridor 10&quot; in the federal National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 and as &quot;High Priority Corridor 45&quot; in later legislation. Over the many years of development, the project changed multiple times.

In 2004, Corridor X was designated as Future I-22 by Public Law Number 108-199, and the designation was made official on April 18, 2005. In Alabama and Mississippi, blue signs reading &quot;FUTURE/I-22/CORRIDOR&quot; at left and an I-22 shield with &quot;FUTURE&quot; instead of &quot;INTERSTATE&quot; at the right were unveiled on April 18, 2005.

The first major completed section of the route between the Mississippi state line and Jasper was opened to traffic on November 22, 2005. Exits on the Jasper Bypass portion of I-22 were originally numbered using a kilometer-based sequence because, at the time this stretch was opened, it appeared that all highways in the US were going to be measured using the metric system. The final decision was made to remain using miles, and they have been renumbered according to the highway&#x27;s mileposts. A segment between Graysville and Brookside was opened in June 2007, and another section of Future I-22 between Jasper and Graysville was opened in November 2007. A segment between Cherry Avenue in Forestdale to a point about short of I-65 near Fultondale, including an interchange with Coalburg Road, was opened in December 2009. Next came the connection of I-22 with I-65 and US 31. The Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) widened Coalburg Road from its interchange with I-22 southward to Daniel Payne Drive (which leads to I-65) to allow heavy trucks to use it; this project was nearly complete as of May 2015. Signs are now in place on Daniel Payne Drive (westbound) informing truckers that access to I-22 is not allowed from Daniel Payne Drive.

ALDOT was to award contracts in August 2009 for the construction of the final segment of I-22, including its large interchange with I-65 and US 31, with the construction to begin shortly afterward. Funding delays postponed these into 2010, however. On March 19, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (HIRE Act) into law, which included an extension of federal highway funding through the end of 2010. This extension gave the ALDOT the opportunity to proceed with its plans for the construction of final segment of I-22 in Alabama. The opening of the bids for this project began on May 21, 2010. ALDOT announced on June 16, 2010, that the project has been awarded to the company Archer Western Contractors for $168.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project is the most expensive highway project ever undertaken in Jefferson County, and it is the highest-priced contract awarded by the ALDOT .

On November 12, 2012, ALDOT&#x27;s application for establishing I-22 was conditionally approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) at a special committee, pending for the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) to submit their own application for I-22 and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval. This therefore officially established the existence of I-22.

In April 2013, the first actual I-22 shields were deployed in Marion County, Alabama, immediately east of the Mississippi state line. Such signs will extend east at least through Walker County into the outskirts of Birmingham. On August 21, 2014, ALDOT reported that I-22&#x27;s interchange with I-65 would not be completed until October 2015. The interchange&#x27;s connections via exit 95 to I-65 and the continuation under I-65 as exit 95C at US 31 remained under construction. In March 2016, the interchange with I-65 and continuation to US 31 was still under construction. New lanes north and southbound were opened on I-65 passing through the interchange and construction and painting operations were carried out on the I-22 entrance and exit ramps. The interchange to I-65 opened to traffic on June 20, 2016, while the connector to US 31 remained under construction.

Mississippi officials announced May 5, 2015, that the state officially began the process to designate its portion as I-22. The two requirements to be able to apply for this designation were to upgrade the route to Interstate standards and to connect to an existing Interstate within 25 years; this was completed when I-269 was opened in December 2017. The I-65 interchange was opened in October 2015. The route was officially signed in Mississippi in a ceremony on October 23, 2015.

Mississippi exit numbers are based on US 78 mileage. 




















==Future auxiliary routes==
===Interstate 222===

Interstate 222 (I-222) is a future auxiliary Interstate Highway that will be a connector between I-22 and the proposed I-422 near Birmingham, Alabama. There will be no exits other than its termini. The highway has been proposed because an interchange directly between I-22 and I-422 cannot be built due to environmental issues. AASHTO approved the designation on May 18, 2012. Construction on this new route has not been scheduled at this time.

===Interstate 422===
I-422 is a future proposed northwestern bypass of Birmingham, connecting between I-20/I-59 from the southwest and I-59 in the northeast. It will also be connected with I-22 via I-222 in Brookside, located northwest of Birmingham. It was first proposed in May 2009 by US Representative Spencer Bachus; on May 18, 2012, it was approved by AASHTO. Construction on a short section of the route between SR 79 and 75 was started shortly afterwards, but issues with funding and local opposition held up the project. More funding for the interstate was provided in Spring 2023. It covered the construction of I-422 between SR 79 to US 31 for a total of . The construction of this part of the interstate, which will be four lanes, was expected to begin later in the Spring and be completed by 2028, but the completion date was delayed to 2032. A complaint has been filed over construction resuming, and although ALDOT expected to break ground on the resumption of the project in November 2023, no new information was made public for several months. Work finally resumed on the initial phase between SR 75 and SR 79 in late-June 2024, this phase is expected to be completed in 2027.

<doc id="982802" wikidata="Q488732" url="?curid=982802" title="Shock (economics)">
<text>In economics, a shock is an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy, either positively or negatively. Technically, it is an unpredictable change in exogenous factors—that is, factors unexplained by an economic model—which may influence endogenous economic variables.

The response of economic variables, such as GDP and employment, at the time of the shock and at subsequent times, is measured by an impulse response function.

==Types of shocks==

A technology shock is the kind resulting from a technological development that affects productivity.

If the shock is due to constrained supply, it is termed a supply shock and usually results in price increases for a particular product. Supply shocks can be produced when accidents or disasters occur. The 2008 Western Australian gas crisis resulting from a pipeline explosion at Varanus Island is one example.

A demand shock is a sudden change of the pattern of private expenditure, especially of consumption spending by consumers or of investment spending by businesses.

A preference shock is a change in preferences over consumption or leisure.

An inflationary shock happens when prices of commodities increase suddenly (e.g., after a decrease of government subsidies) while not all salaries are adjusted immediately throughout society (this results in a temporary loss of purchasing power for many consumers); or that production costs begin to exceed corporate revenues (e.g. following energy price hikes).

A monetary policy shock occurs when a central bank changes, without sufficient advance warning, its pattern of interest rate or money supply control. A fiscal policy shock is an unexpected change of government spending or taxation amounts.

A news shock is a change in current expectations of future technological progress, which could be induced by new information about potential technological developments.

In the context of microeconomics, shocks are also studied at the household level, such as health, income, and consumption shocks. Negative individual and household economic shocks can result from job loss, for example, while positive shocks can come from winning the lottery. For example, in development microeconomics the relationship between household income shocks and household levels of consumption is studied to understand a household&#x27;s ability to insure itself (testing the full-insurance hypothesis).

==Political impact==
Economic shocks impact political preference. The experience of negative shocks such as job loss causes individuals to favor redistributive policies and broader social policies. Some evidence shows that negative economic shocks cause individuals to lose faith in political systems, though this erosion of trust is often temporary, rebounding over time. A narrow portion of voters may change their voting patterns in response to shock, which can include support for candidates and policies that are antiestablishment, populist, leftist, or ceasing to participate in the electoral process. Positive economic shocks are linked to an increase in trust in government institutions.

<text>Sabin Woolworth Colton, Jr. (March 18, 1847 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – January 29, 1925 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania) was an American investor. He was the only private individual to ever own a chair on both the Philadelphia and New York Stock Exchanges.

He became an office boy in 1862 at a stock brokerage, later became a clerk there. While a clerk there bought his own chair on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. His expertise was in underwriting the establishment of utility companies in exchange for stock in those companies.

He retired in 1910, having built a spacious family house, Longmeadow, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, and an elegant Arts &amp; Crafts-style summer house, Faraway, on Eastern Point of Greening Island, Maine.

<doc id="982822" wikidata="Q1755077" url="?curid=982822" title="Coagulase">
<text>Coagulase is a protein enzyme produced by several microorganisms that enables the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. In the laboratory, it is used to distinguish between different types of &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; isolates. Importantly, &quot;S. aureus&quot; is generally coagulase-positive, meaning that a positive coagulase test would indicate the presence of &quot;S. aureus&quot; or any of the other 11 coagulase-positive &quot;Staphylococci&quot;. A negative coagulase test would instead show the presence of coagulase-negative organisms such as &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; or &quot;S. saprophyticus&quot;. However, it is now known that not all &quot;S. aureus&quot; are coagulase-positive. Whereas coagulase-positive staphylococci are usually pathogenic, coagulase-negative staphylococci are more often associated with opportunistic infection.

It is also produced by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;.

Coagulase reacts with prothrombin in the blood. The resulting complex is called &quot;staphylothrombin&quot;, which enables the enzyme to act as a protease to convert fibrinogen, a plasma protein produced by the liver, to fibrin. This results in clotting of the blood. Coagulase is tightly bound to the surface of the bacterium &quot;S. aureus&quot; and can coat its surface with fibrin upon contact with blood. The fibrin clot may protect the bacterium from phagocytosis and isolate it from other defenses of the host. The fibrin coat can therefore make the bacteria more virulent. Bound coagulase is part of the larger family of MSCRAMM adhesin proteins.

== Coagulase test ==

The coagulase test has traditionally been used to differentiate &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; from coagulase-negative staphylococci. &quot;S.aureus&quot; produces two forms of coagulase (i.e., bound coagulase and free coagulase). Bound coagulase, otherwise known as &quot;clumping factor&quot;, can be detected by carrying out a slide coagulase test, and free coagulase can be detected using a tube coagulase test.

=== Slide test ===
A slide coagulase test is run with a negative control to rule out autoagglutination. Two drops of saline are put onto the slide labeled with sample number, Test (T) and control (C). The two saline drops are emulsified with the test organism using a wire loop, straight wire, or wooden stick. A drop of plasma (rabbit plasma anticoagulated with EDTA is recommended) is placed on the inoculated saline drop corresponding to test, and mixed well, then the slide is rocked gently for about 10 seconds.

* If &#x27;positive&#x27;, macroscopic clumping would be observed in the plasma within 10 seconds, with no clumping in the saline drop.
* If &#x27;negative&#x27;, no clumping will be observed.

If the slide coagulase test is negative, a tube test should follow as a confirmation. Clumping in both drops is an indication of autoagglutination, so a tube test should be carried out. Tube test is not performed each institutions but most of the result depends on blood cultures from lab.

=== Tube test ===

The tube test uses rabbit plasma that has been inoculated with a staphylococcal colony (i.e., Gram-positive cocci which are catalase positive). The tube is then incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 hours. If negative, then incubation is continued up to 18 hours. 
* If &#x27;positive&#x27; (e.g., the suspect colony is &quot;S. aureus&quot;), the plasma will coagulate, resulting in a clot (sometimes the clot is so pronounced, the liquid will completely solidify).
* If &#x27;negative&#x27;, the plasma remains a liquid. The negative result may be &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; but only a more detailed identification test can confirm this, using biochemical tests as in analytical profile index tests methods. A false negative can be perceived if the sample is not allowed to cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature or 10 minutes in the freezer, given that the serum can melt. If truly negative, the serum will remain liquid after cooling.
* List of coagulase-positive staphylococci: &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; subsp. &quot;anaerobius&quot;, &quot;S. aureus subsp. aureus&quot;, &quot;S. delphini&quot;, &quot;S. hyicus&quot;, &quot;S. intermedius&quot;, &quot;S. lutrae&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus schleiferi&quot; subsp. &quot;coagulans&quot;.
* List of coagulase-negative staphylococci of clinical significance: &quot;S. saprophyticus&quot;, &quot;S.cohnii&quot; subsp. &quot;cohnii&quot;, &quot;S. cohnii&quot; subsp. &quot;urealyticum&quot;, &quot;S. captitus&quot; subsp. &quot;captitus&quot;, &quot;S. warneri&quot;, &quot;S.hominis&quot;, &quot;S.epidermidis&quot;, &quot;S. caprae&quot;, and &quot;S.lugdunensis&quot;

<text>Steve Ramsey is a British guitarist who began his career with the heavy metal band Satan in the early 1980s, releasing a single and an album, a second album under the band name Blind Fury, an EP and another album after changing the band name back to Satan and two more albums after renaming the band name once again, to Pariah.

After the split of Pariah in 1990, he teamed up with singer Martin Walkyier (ex-Sabbat) to form a heavy metal band with strong folk influences, called Skyclad.

Ramsey has also participated in other band projects, for example as album guest and live guitarist for Forgodsake.

Ramsey is influenced by classic hard rock acts like Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, etc. While initially starting as a thrash metal band with folk influences, these &quot;classic&quot; roots became more and more visible in Skyclad&#x27;s music over the years.
