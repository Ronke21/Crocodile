<text>The East Rail line () is one of the ten lines that form MTR, the mass transit system in Hong Kong. The railway line starts at Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau, both of which are boundary crossing points into Shenzhen and joins in the north at Sheung Shui and ends at Admiralty station on Hong Kong Island. At approximately , the line (including the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line) is the second longest line within the network, behind the Tuen Ma line. The line&#x27;s colour is light blue, formerly navy blue before the KCR/MTR merger.

The line connects the new towns of Fanling–Sheung Shui, Tai Po and Sha Tin in eastern New Territories with urban Kowloon and the central business district. It is also the city&#x27;s only Railway line that connects to land-based border checkpoints with Mainland China. The line is generally double tracked and electrified, except for certain goods sheds. All of the stations on the line except Admiralty, Exhibition Centre and Hung Hom are at-grade or elevated. As of 2018, the line carried around 1 million passenger trips per day.

Opening in 1910 as the Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section), the line is the first heavy rail line in Hong Kong. Prior to the MTR–KCR merger in 2007, the line (then known as KCR East Rail) formed part of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR) network and was managed by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC). On 2 December 2007, the line was taken over by MTR Corporation (MTRC) and was given its current name. KCRC continues to own the line and its infrastructure while leasing its operations to MTRC.

The same railway was used for intercity passenger and freight services crossing the boundary into Mainland China. Freight services on the line ceased in 2009, while the intercity passenger services were suspended in early 2020 amidst the coronavirus pandemic, with no plans to resume service despite border reopenings.

==History==

===Background===

====Proposal====
The United Kingdom and China signed an agreement to cooperate on the construction of a railway from Kowloon to Canton (now Guangzhou). The whole project was long, with in the British Section and for the Chinese Section. However, the English could earn 65% of the income while China could only earn 35% of it. Construction started in 1906. The most difficult section was the approx. 7200-foot-long (2195 m) Beacon Hill Tunnel, and about a hundred workers died in the construction.

====Construction====
The construction was mainly carried out by the Chinese. The government built camps in Kowloon to support the construction. Most of the railway alignment was on flat land, so construction was relatively easy in those places, however, the construction of the Beacon Hill Tunnel involved digging and blasting. The tunnel&#x27;s two ends were of soft soil, but the centre was granite. This caused a delay in construction as it was not suitable to use explosives at the two ends while the explosives could not blast off a lot of rock in the centre.

===Pre-electrification era===
The railway line to the Chinese border, then called the Kowloon-Canton Railway (British Section) (KCRBS; ), opened for passenger services on 1 October 1910. The remaining section from Lo Wu to Canton (now Guangzhou) was called the &quot;Chinese Section&quot; (now the Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway). Initially, service was only provided from Yaumati station to Fanling station with a tunnel through Beacon Hill.

After the &quot;Chinese Section&quot; was completed, through train service to Canton through Sham Chun (now Shenzhen) became available. Lo Wu station also serves as a border crossing, with a bridge across the Sham Chun River, the natural border between Hong Kong and Mainland China. Trains had to stop at Lo Wu station after Communist China closed the border and suspended the through train service in 1949.

The line was generally single track, with a passing loop at each station. It was originally built with narrow gauge tracks, but just before opening standard gauge track was laid and the original tracks were used to build a branch line, the Sha Tau Kok Railway from Fanling to Sha Tau Kok. This branch was unsuccessful and closed on 1 April 1928 following the opening of a road that ran parallel to the tracks.

Through the years, more stations were added to the line. Sheung Shui station was opened in the 1930s, and Ma Liu Shui (now University) station opened in 1955.

The KCR engines were powered by steam engines before the 1950s. There were 20 engines. However, diesel engines were purchased starting from 1950, with the first one with number 51. Steam engines then disappeared from KCR.

The development of the towns along the line began to grow immensely during the 1970s, prompting a modernisation of the Kowloon-Canton Railway. The original Kowloon station terminus at Tsim Sha Tsui was too small and had no room for expansion, so a new terminus site was chosen in Hung Hom. Hung Hom station replaced the old one and the old Hung Hom station in 1975. Today, a clock tower is the only structure left from the old terminus, and is a landmark near the Cultural Centre, Space Museum and the Star Ferry pier. Six pillars dismantled from the original station building were relocated to the Urban Council Centenary Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui East. A big bell is stored at Ho Tung Lau. The original Hung Hom station at Chatham Road South was also demolished.

===1980s modernisation===

In 1975, the KCR asked two consultancies, Sofrerail and Transmark, to make proposals on the modernisation of the line. In 1979, Transmark&#x27;s proposal to double-track and electrify the entire line for $2.5 billion (in 1979 prices) was accepted by the government. This work involved building a new tunnel through Beacon Hill as the existing tunnel was not wide enough to accommodate two tracks. New stations were added, including Kowloon Tong station, which was completed in 1982 to provide an interchange with the new MTR network. Tai Po Kau station and the original Tai Po Market station were closed, with the latter being redeveloped into the Hong Kong Railway Museum. The development finished in sections between 1982 and 1983, with new Metro Cammell EMUs, manufactured by Metro-Cammell in England, replacing diesel locomotives.

With the modernisation of the railway and the concurrent urbanisation of the New Territories, ridership rose quickly, from a daily average of 190,000 in 1983 to 491,000 in 1990. A temporary station in Tai Wai opened in 1983 while the permanent Tai Wai station was completed in 1986. Fo Tan station opened in 1985 to serve the expanding industrial estate. Tai Wo station opened in 1989 to serve Tai Wo Estate and to replace Tai Po Kau station and the old Tai Po Market station.

===Expansion since the 1990s===
The 1990s saw more rapid development and changes within the railway. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) signed a contract with Anglo-French manufacturing giant GEC-Alsthom to refurbish the Metro-Cammell EMUs at the East Rail depot at Ho Tung Lau. In 1996, the first refurbished train was put into service on the line, which was now known as KCR East Rail (), and trains now allow passengers to traverse from one end to another (except for the first class carriage), when trains once ran on four three-car EMUs. All but three of the 351 railcars were refurbished; the only unit exempt from refurbishment was unit E44 (144-244-444), which is currently stored in Ho Tung Lau depot. The yellow-cab train was formally retired with a &quot;Farewell Ride&quot; on 31 October 1999.

When refurbished, each set was still made up of 12 cars (with one first-class car). Prior to the rule proclaimed in 1994 which fixed the number of cars on each set to 12, trains were inconsistent in terms of length, ranging from six cars (two EMUs), nine cars (three EMUs) to 12 cars (four EMUs).

In terms of appearance, trains no longer have the monotonous design of having a red stripe running across the middle from the cab to the end; the doors now have a red coating, and the window panes along with the upper part are fashioned with blue paint. The original design of the train front, encapsulating the driver&#x27;s cab and commonly referred to as the &quot;Yellow-cab&quot;, was replaced with a more modern design capped with a silver coating, and a digital display added providing the train&#x27;s destination.

The design of the EMU was modified as well: four more sets of doors being added to each car, adding up to a total of ten sets of doors, each side with five; the introduction of new passenger information plasma display; and more standing space by rearranging seating patterns from the traditional back-to-back seating to a longitudinal design.

In 1998, a new signalling system, known as Transmission balise-locomotive (TBL, as used in Belgium), came into operation on the line. This Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, a replacement for the previous Automatic Warning System (AWS) developed in Britain, ensures a safe distance is maintained between trains. It also allowed an increase in train frequencies from 20 to 24 per hour each way. The control centre was also relocated from Kowloon station to a new facility in the KCRC operations headquarters building at KCRC House (now known as the Fo Tan Railway House). Also as part of the ATP project, a two kilometre section of the tracks near the Pak Shek Kok reclamation, curving around the former coastline, was straightened out during the mid-1990s. The tracks now run alongside the Tolo Highway. A vestige of the former alignment, an old bridge beside Cheung Shue Tan village built between 1906 and 1909, was identified by the Antiquities and Monuments Office in 2008 as a historic asset.

In 2002, an automatic train operation (ATO) system was added to TBL, which controls the speed of the train for the driver and ensures that all trains will stop when arriving at every station. Under normal circumstances, most trains are operated in ATO mode except for scenarios such as operation of trains in and out of train depots, driver training, or at times when the ATO system fails to function properly. However, intercity trains using the East Rail line continue to operate on AWS.In 2004, the railway was extended in tunnel to a new southern terminus at East Tsim Sha Tsui station. On 28 December 2004, a branch to the East Rail, the Ma On Shan Rail was added, with an interchange at Tai Wai.

On 15 August 2007, an extension from Sheung Shui station northwest through a tunnel to Lok Ma Chau station was opened. This provides a second border crossing between Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China.

===Development under MTR Corporation===
The Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR) network, of which East Rail was part of, was amalgamated into the MTR system on 2 December 2007. The KCR East Rail was renamed the East Rail line. At that time, the line terminated at East Tsim Sha Tsui in the south, and Lo Wu / Lok Ma Chau in the north.

On 16 August 2009, Hung Hom became the southern endpoint of both the East Rail line and West Rail Line after the completion of the Kowloon Southern Link. The section of East Rail line between Hung Hom and East Tsim Sha Tsui was taken over by the West Rail line, with the latter station becoming an intermediate stop on West Rail line (now part of Tuen Ma line).

As the COVID-19 pandemic started to affect Hong Kong in early 2020, the Hong Kong government closed all border crossings on the land boundary with Mainland China, including the Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line control points, on 3 February. During the closure, Lo Wu station served only certified residents nearby, while passenger service at Lok Ma Chau was completely suspended. Northbound trains terminated at Sheung Shui for three years, until Lok Ma Chau crossing was reopened on 8 January 2023 following the lifting of travel restrictions. Lo Wu station reopened to cross-boundary passengers on 6 February 2023, after completion of renovation.

====Shatin to Central Link project====


First conceived in 1967, the Shatin to Central Link (SCL) expansion project received approval in 2012, and began construction later in the same year. Phase 2 of the link is a southern extension of East Rail line which takes the line southward across Victoria Harbour to a new terminus, Admiralty station, on Hong Kong Island. The extension also includes an intermediate station at Exhibition.

In preparation for this extension, the TBL and ATO signalling systems in use on the East Rail line were replaced by the Trainguard MT communications-based train control system supplied by Siemens. The line also received new rolling stock in the form of 37 nine-car R-Trains, which would completely replace all existing trains used on the line. The new signalling system was slated to replace the old ones on 12 September 2020 and R-Trains would start carrying passengers on the same day, but one day before the changeover, the discovery of abnormalities that misrouted Lok Ma Chau bound trains into tracks towards Lo Wu on three occasions during the system reliability tests was revealed by a media report. The changeover of signalling systems was eventually postponed to 6 February 2021. From that day until 6 May 2022, East Rail line entered the stage of &quot;Mixed Fleet Operation&quot; (MFO) in which new 9-car trains were put to service, running alongside and gradually replacing the legacy 12-car Metro-Cammell EMUs (the SP1900 EMUs were removed from service on the line once MFO started).

Passenger services started on the cross-harbour extension on 15 May 2022. The extension allows New Territories East residents to reach the central business district in one train ride. During the first two weeks after the extension&#x27;s commissioning, the patronage of the line&#x27;s critical link, that is the section from Tai Wai to Kowloon Tong, during the busiest hour in the morning peak recorded a 27% increase from 26,000 to 33,100 pphpd. As the need to transfer from the line to other MTR lines (at Kowloon Tong or Hung Hom / East Tsim Sha Tsui) or cross-harbour tunnel buses (at Hung Hom) for destinations on Hong Kong Island is now eliminated, the new extension had relieved the critical links on Tsuen Wan line and Kwun Tong line of around 20% and 10% loading during morning peak, respectively.
The introduction of new trains and signalling systems under the SCL project presented an opportunity to improve the line&#x27;s infrastructure. The local community had long fought for the retrofitting of automatic platform gates (APGs) on East Rail line platforms, yet the pre-SCL signalling system could not support their addition. As construction of the SCL project progressed, advance works for APGs installation including platform structure reinforcement was also carried out. A year after the cross-harbour extension opened, the installation of APGs formally commenced, with the first pairs of APGs at Racecourse and Tai Po Market stations putting into operation on 7 May and 3 June 2023, respectively.

===Tunnels===
Tunnels on the East Rail line have numbers assigned to them. When the railway was first opened, there were five tunnels:
# North of today&#x27;s Mong Kok East station
# Beacon Hill Tunnel
# South of where University station stands today
# North of university station
# At Tai Po Kau

During the construction of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, which opened in 1972, the section of tracks near Oi Man Estate, Ho Man Tin was covered to construct the section of Princess Margaret Road connecting to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. A new tunnel was therefore created and given the number 1A.

During the modernisation of the line in the early 1980s, Tunnels 1, 3, 4 were removed by demolishing the mounds above them. Tunnel 1A already had double track width when built; a completely new Beacon Hill Tunnel (Tunnel 2) was constructed and took over the original one; and Tunnel 5 was doubled. The new one is known as Tunnel 5A.

==Rolling stock==


The line is currently served solely by nine-car R-Stock trains built by Hyundai Rotem, which entered service on 6 February 2021. Thirty-seven sets were built by Hyundai Rotem between 2014 and 2022.

Before the introduction of the new R-Stock trains, the East Rail line was operated with two types of commuter trains: the 29 refurbished Metro-Cammell EMUs (also known as Mid-Life Refurbished Trains) and eight sets of the newer SP1900 EMUs, manufactured by Kinki Sharyo of Japan in 2001. Both models shared the same exterior colour scheme, door arrangement (five pairs per car, except first class), as well as consisting of 12 carriages per train including a first class section. The interior design between the two models is different, and the transverse seating near the ends of the Metro-Cammell carriages has been replaced with longitudinal seating in the Kinki Sharyo models to allow for a wider gangway between compartments. All of the East Rail line Hyundai-Rotem trains are maintained at Ho Tung Lau Depot in Sha Tin.

With the construction of the Sha Tin to Central Link, which cannot accommodate trains of greater than nine cars, the MTR decided in December 2012 to phase out all of the aging Metro-Cammell trains from 2020 and replace them with 37 sets of 9-car R-Stock trains built by Hyundai Rotem of South Korea. In 2020, the MTR purchased an additional 6 trains bringing the total number to 43 sets. The first new train arrived in Hong Kong in September 2015 and entered service in February 2021. They fully replaced the older fleet in time for the opening of the Hung Hom to Admiralty section of the Sha Tin to Central Link on 15 May 2022. Due to the shorter train length, there are concerns that the new formation may worsen the existing overcrowding problem. However, the Transport and Housing Bureau and MTRC suggest that the new signaling system and higher train speeds will increase the train frequency from three minutes down to two minutes. It is also estimated that with the completion of the Sha Tin to Central Link (Tai Wai – Hung Hom section), 20% of the current East Rail line passengers will take the new East West Corridor.

The SP1900 EMUs were withdrawn from the East Rail line on 6 February 2021 and, together with the SP1900/1950 sets on the West Rail and Ma On Shan lines, are being reconfigured as 8-car trains to serve the Tuen Ma line. The conversion project is taking place at MTR&#x27;s Pat Heung Depot and converted sets are being placed into service on the Tuen Ma line alongside newly delivered CRRC Changchun TML C-trains (nicknamed as the pseudo-SP1900 due to its similarity to the SP1900). The SP1900 first class cars will be shipped back to Kinki Sharyo factory in Osaka, Japan for conversion into standard-class compartments. The Metro-Cammell EMUs were retired on 6 May 2022 after 40 years of service, with the last train leaving Hung Hom at 13:00, departing for Sha Tin, and ending service there to a large crowd who took the train.

===First class===
The East Rail line is the only railway in Hong Kong to offer first class commuter service. One car of each train is designated as a first class carriage (Northbound Car No.4 and Southbound Car No.6). These compartments have softer and wider seat arrangements; however, standing in the first class car is common during rush hour.

Riding on this carriage costs twice that of a standard-class journey and passengers are required to buy the first class ticket (at the vending machine on East Rail line stations or ticket counters at the other stations) or revalidate their Octopus cards on the first class reader (located at the station platforms and beside the gangway door of the First class compartment itself) before entering the first-class car. Ticket Inspectors will perform random checks on train, and passengers failing to produce a valid first class ticket or validated Octopus Card will be liable to a surcharge of $1000.

== Train service ==
Domestic trains on the East Rail line operate from around 05:30 to 01:00 the next day, running at around 3–8 minute intervals for most part of the day. Trains operate at roughly 15–16 trains per hour (tph) per direction off-peak, and drops to a minimum of 6 tph during early morning and late night hours. Most trains serve between Admiralty and Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau, with one train to Lok Ma Chau following two trains to Lo Wu. However, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations close at approximately 00:30 the next day and 23:00 respectively, which means that Sheung Shui is the northern terminus after both border checkpoints are closed.

During peak hours, trains are more frequent, running every 2–3 minutes. Between Sheung Shui and Admiralty, there are 20 tph during morning peak, bringing the train frequency up to 2.7-3.8 minute intervals. Additional short-haul trains would also depart from Tai Po Market and Sha Tin, augmenting the number of trains south of Sha Tin to 23 tph.

The line&#x27;s usual service patterns on non-race days could be summarised as follows:-
* Lo Wu– Admiralty
* Lok Ma Chau– Admiralty
* Sheung Shui – Admiralty (additional trips are also operated during morning peak)
* Tai Po Market– Admiralty (around 5 pairs during weekday morning peak; 2 southbound trips in the afternoon)
* Sha Tin– Admiralty (operated by trains leaving/returning to Ho Tung Lau Depot; 1 pair during morning peak; northbound trips also run in the evening)
* Sheung Shui– Hung Hom (northbound trips in early morning before first Lo Wu bound train from Admiralty arrives; last few southbound trips at late night terminating at Hung Hom station Platform 4 and Platform 1 (last train); early morning trips before first southbound train from Lo Wu arrive at Sha Tin)
* Lok Ma Chau – Hung Hom(northbound trips in early morning before first Lok Ma Chau bound train from Admiralty arrives; early morning trips before first southbound train from Lok Ma Chau arrive at Sha Tin)

Racecourse station is only open to passenger traffic during horse racing meetings at the Sha Tin Racecourse, during which some trains would be channelled through Racecourse instead of calling at the parallel Fo Tan station. Trains terminating at Racecourse might also be operated.

===Cross-boundary train services===
====Train services to boundary crossings====
Both Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations are integrated with immigration control points between Hong Kong and Mainland China. The two stations are located within the Frontier Closed Area (FCA) and access is restricted to genuine boundary-crossing passengers with a valid travel document, and nearby residents holding Closed Area Permits.

Journeys to and from the cross-boundary stations (except approved FCA residents holding a Railcard) are charged at a premium, the proceeds of which is used to cross-subsidise fares of domestic journeys to a certain extent.

====Intercity Through Train====
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Intercity Through Train () service shared tracks with East Rail line domestic service between Hung Hom and Lo Wu. These intercity trains ran across the Hong Kong–China border and proceed to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing in Mainland China. Intercity trains did not call at stations in Hong Kong apart from the Hung Hom terminus, where both inbound and outbound passengers complete their Hong Kong immigration and customs clearance.

In July 2020, all of the Intercity Through Train routes has been permanently discontinued. As the demand for long-distance train service has been catered to by the new Guangshengang XRL which opened 2018, there are currently no plans to resume the Intercity Through Train service despite the reopening of the border in 2023.

==Stations==
This is a list of the stations on the East Rail line.

===Notes===

In May 2008, MTR announced plans to renew many stations, some of which have been in service for over half a century. Refurbishment is not expected to be fully completed until 2016 at the earliest.

There are long distances between University and Tai Po Market stations, between Tai Wo and Fanling stations, and between Sheung Shui and Lok Ma Chau stations; and there are no intermediate stations within these sections. These sections of track are nearby the Science Park, Tai Po Kau, Hong Lok Yuen, Kau Lung Hang village, and Kwu Tung village. However, intermediate stations within some sections of the track are under planning.

==Safety==
The East Rail line is Hong Kong&#x27;s oldest heavy railway (as opposed to the tramways). While generally regarded as very safe, the railway suffered some serious incidents during its history.

===Train accidents===
At about 11:00 on 14 June 1923, a train derailed at Ma Liu Shui due to a landslide following heavy rain. The locomotive and one coach derailed and slid down the embankment to the edge of Tide Cove. Nobody was injured.

The same locomotive involved in the 1923 incident was involved in a more serious derailment on 20 April 1931. Owing to heavy rains, an embankment at Ma Liu Shui south of today&#x27;s University station was weakened. It collapsed as a Kowloon-bound train passed over it at about 17:10, causing the locomotive and four carriages to crash and pile atop one another. There were 12 deaths and eight serious injuries.

On 12 November 1955, a fatal accident occurred at Mile 17, the site of a private military level crossing. A speeding passenger train struck a British military &quot;Comet&quot; tank at the crossing. A new diesel electric locomotive, the &quot;Sir Alexander&quot; (now exhibited in the Hong Kong Railway Museum), derailed. Various other carriages were severely damaged. The train guard and a member of the tank crew were killed.

At 15:00 on 18 December 1980, a contractor building Mong Kok (now Mong Kok East) station accidentally severed signalling cables, disabling the automatic signalling system. At this time, the railway had been only partly doubled-tracked, and still made use of the old single-track Beacon Hill Tunnel. Later in the day, two trains were inadvertently put on a head-on collision course just south of the tunnel. At 18:40, a Lo Wu-bound train carrying about 1,500 passengers reached the point where the double-tracked section of the railway ended ahead of the tunnel, near Yau Yat Chuen. A safety device, a trap point, prevented the collision by forcing the train to derail, causing minor injuries to some passengers. A minute later, a southbound train came to a screeching halt at the accident site. A KCR spokesman blamed &quot;a misunderstanding in a telephone communication&quot;.

On 25 November 1984, a train derailed between Sheung Shui and Lo Wu stations. The incident occurred when the driver, meaning to back the train up to Sheung Shui station, failed to follow a speed/stop signal while the train was exceeding the speed limit. The train was being driven from the rear cabin, with the driver relying on signals from the train guard who was in the front carriage. The train sped past a danger signal onto a siding at 30 km/h, rather than shunting onto the main line at 10 km/h as it was meant to. It crashed into a concrete buffer at the end of the siding, with the first two cars piling on top of each other. The damage was so severe that the cars never returned to service. Passengers had been unloaded prior to the crash while the two KCR employees escaped significant injury. However, the accident caused train services to be suspended for the rest of the day and the incident spurred a series of public outcries concerning railway safety. The KCR determined that the accident occurred due to human error and not any system failure, suspended the driver, and changed procedures such that drivers were required to operate the train from the front carriage while shunting at Sheung Shui.

In 1988, there were numerous separate incidents of Chinese freight trains derailing on the railway. On 28 May, a locomotive and a goods wagon jumped the tracks near Fo Tan station, blocking the line. Services were temporarily detoured through Racecourse station. On 4 June, a wagon derailed near University station, again blocking the line. Coupled with a lorry accident in the Lion Rock Tunnel the same day, Kowloon and Sha Tin were thrown into &quot;traffic chaos&quot;. On 2 July, another goods wagon derailed on a siding in Lo Wu after arriving from Shenzhen. As it was being hauled to the Fo Tan workshop at 1:44 am the following day for examination, it derailed again, though damage to the tracks was minor. Nobody was injured in the above incidents. The problems were attributed to uneven loading of the freight trains, sharply curved trackage &quot;unideal&quot; for the freight wagons, and the structural characteristics of the Chinese trains. In response, KCRC carried out track improvements and liaised with the Guangzhou Railway Administration. At the time, the KCRC handled 6.25 million freight wagons per year, so the derailments were relatively isolated occurrences.

In the early morning of 31 May 1989, diesel locomotive L57 collided head-on with locomotive L56 at Mongkok (now Mong Kok East) station, causing injuries to four KCR staff. Three employees in L57 were taking the locomotive from Kowloon (now Hung Hom) station to Fo Tan for repairs. The locomotive ran a red signal and struck the stationary L56 while traveling at about 50 km/h. Chan Yau-keung, a KCRC construction supervisor, was critically injured and died on 8 June at Kwong Wah Hospital. He had been standing between the driver Ko Yuk-ching and co-driver Lee Kam-ming, both of whom were seated. Ko was a qualified driver while Lee, an assistant operator, was operating under Ko&#x27;s supervision. Lee was driving at the time of the accident, but was seated in the left of the cabin and could not see the signals, which were on the right and were obscured by the long hood of the vehicle. According to procedures, Lee had to rely on Ko to relay him the status of the signals. Ko, speaking at an inquest following the accident, stated that he had felt dizzy and could not recall what colours the signals displayed. The advance warning system (AWS) of locomotive L57, which would have automatically halted the train, was switched off. KCR officers in the control centre saw the impending collision but could not warn the crew as the L57 radio was switched off.

On 17 September 2019 at 08:32, East Rail service L094 carrying around 500 passengers derailed while approaching Platform 1 of Hung Hom station, injuring eight passengers, with five of whom hospitalised. Cars 4 to 6 were derailed, with cars 4 and 5 disconnected, while cars 1-3 and 7-12 remained on the track. An independent investigation by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department revealed the cause of the derailment to be a widened track gauge due to the deterioration of the railway sleeper. Sleepers (35-36) of turnout P5116 were found to have been rotted and the screw hole deformed and enlarged. This significantly weakened the ability of the sleepers to be secured to the baseplate and thus maintain proper track gauge. In addition, under the dynamic stress load of the train running over it, the track widened excessively. Sections of the track, including check rails, were found broken and cracked. It was found that four earlier trains that entered Hung Hom station on that morning before service L094 had also suffered hit marks on their wheels. Track sections between 17 sleepers in turnout P5116 exceeded the safety limit of 1,455 mm (the designed track gauge was 1,435 mm). The investigation recommended the installation of real-time monitoring equipment to improve the surveillance of track conditions so that an improved maintenance regime could prevent similar events from occurring in the future.

===Underframe cracking===
On 21 December 2005, a Metro Cammell EMU failed while in operation. Following examination of the train, KCRC staff detected minor cracks in the welding of mounting brackets for some underframe components. A review panel commissioned by KCRC looked into the problem from four aspects:
* the rate of change of the acceleration and deceleration of trains
* the welding of components&#x27; mounting brackets
* the profile of the track and train wheels
* suspension system

Since the full introduction of automatic train operation (ATO) on the East Rail system in 2003, the rate of change of acceleration and deceleration resulting from ATO driving added stress to the underframe components. To allow a root cause investigation to be carried out, the use of the ATO system was suspended on 15 January 2006, leaving the operation of trains back in the hands of the train drivers, the safety of train operation under the control of the automatic train protection system. This resulted in a decreased frequency (from 24 to 23 trains per hour) and lengthened trip time (increase by 90 seconds to 42.5 minutes). KCRC also temporarily transferred some staff from West Rail to cope with recent maintenance of trains.

The Environment, Transport and Works Bureau reprimanded the KCRC for not immediately notifying the Government when it found problems with its East Rail trains in 2005. Secretary for the Bureau Dr. Sarah Liao said she had ordered the KCRC to inspect all its trains, and did not rule out suspending services if there were safety doubts. Dr. Liao ordered the chairman to review the corporation&#x27;s operations, including its management and overall system, and submit a report. KCRC chairman Michael Tien accepted responsibility for the corporation&#x27;s poor judgement in not sharing the information with the public in a timely matter.

On 21 January 2006, Michael Tien stated that the safety problems of East Rail had been controlled, and the train service was expected to operate as usual, including train service in the Chinese New Year. KCRC East Rail trains reverted to the ATO operation on 6 August 2006, after the investigation confirmed that the ATO system was not a direct cause of the cracking.

===Platform gaps===
The wide platform gap at several stations (namely Lo Wu, Tai Wo, University, Kowloon Tong, and Mong Kok East) is a safety concern. The KCRC has visually marked the &quot;Gap Black Spots&quot; on the platforms of those stations and stated that plates will be installed in the gap between the train and station. The platform gap is mainly caused by the curvature of the station and how the train enters the station area. A mechanical gap filler system, which extends the platform edge when a train is stopped at the station, was trialed at Lo Wu station in 2008–2009, yet it was not pursued due to poor reliability during inclement weather and high failure rate.

After two incidents of children falling onto the tracks at University station in 1985, the issue was discussed in the Legislative Council. The Secretary for Transport asserted that the gaps were within &quot;international safety limits&quot;, and that the gap could not be narrowed due to the curvature of the station as well as the &quot;rather wider bodies&quot; of the Chinese through trains which run through the station daily. A man who fractured his leg boarding a train at University station in 2008 asserted that he fell into a gap of about 35 cm, while the MTR claimed it was only 22 cm at the relevant section of platform.

The new MTR R-Stock trains have wider compartments than the older East Rail line rolling stock, therefore narrowing the gap. Also, due to the decrease in train lengths from twelve cars to nine cars, trains will stop at less curved sections of the platforms. MTR suggests that the width of the gap will be similar to that of the urban lines.

In 2013, the MTR Corporation announced its intention to retrofit half-height automatic platform gates (APGs) on East Rail line platforms as part of the Shatin to Central Link (SCL) project. This would involve the installation of about 1,600 pairs of gates at 13 at-grade or elevated stations along the line, starting from Racecourse and Tai Po Market. However, the actual installation of APGs was not technically feasible until the adoption of the Trainguard MT CBTC signalling system, as the legacy signalling systems used on the line had little capacity to interface smoothly with the APGs. In addition, the Metro-Cammell EMUs lacked an motoring and braking system advanced enough to achieve high accuracy in platform stopping location, which is a prerequisite for APGs operations. As such, the actual installation of APGs could only take place after the new signalling system comes into operation and all Metro-Cammell EMUs are withdrawn from service. Advance works like platform structure strengthening commenced in 2013, yet the first pair of APGs was not installed until 7 May 2023, one week short of the cross-harbour extension&#x27;s first anniversary. A second batch of installation works are expected to commence at Sha Tin, Tai Wai, Lok Ma Chau, and Sheung Shui later in 2023. Kowloon Tong, Fo Tan, and Tai Wo will be the third batch. Mong Kok East, University, and Lo Wu will be the last stations to undergo installation works. All stations are expected to have APGs by the end of 2025.

As the APGs will block passengers&#x27; view of the wide platform gaps, the MTR is installing 140 mechanical gap fillers at Mong Kok East, University, and Lo Wu stations to reduce passengers&#x27; safety risks.

<text>Ceratotherium (Greek: &quot;horn&quot; (keratos), &quot;beast&quot; (therion)) is a genus of the family Rhinocerotidae, consisting of a single extant species, the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;), as well as several fossil species. 

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Ceratotherium&quot; is more closely related to the genus &quot;Diceros&quot; (which contains the black rhinoceros) than it is to other living rhinoceroses, with the clade containing the two comprising the tribe Dicerotini (also spelled Diceroti) or subtribe Dicerotina.

An extinct relative &quot;Ceratotherium mauritanicum&quot;, is known from the Pleistocene of North Africa and possibly the Pliocene of East Africa. Some authors have alternatively assigned the Pliocene East African remains to the species &quot;Ceratotherium efficax.&quot; Some authors have considered &quot;Ceratotherium mauritanicum&quot; to be the ancestor of the living white rhinoceros if the Pliocene East African material is included, though others who only include North African material have suggested that it instead represents a distinct offshoot not ancestral to the white rhinoceros.

Another species known as &quot;Ceratotherium praecox&quot; with remains assigned to the species dating to the Late Miocene and Pliocene (around 7-3 million years ago) of East Africa is now considered a member of the related genus &quot;Diceros&quot; because of the type material probably belongs to this genus, though other material historically assigned to this species likely represents true &quot;Ceratotherium&quot;. The placement of &quot;&quot;Ceratotherium&quot; neumayri&quot; from the Late Miocene of Europe and Western Asia within the genus has been questioned, with it possibly more closely related to the black rhinoceros or ancestral to both the white and black rhinoceros, or an early offshoot away from these two species, with other authors assigning it to &quot;Diceros&quot; or to the monotypic genus &quot;Miodiceros&quot;.&quot;&quot; Some authors have recognised the species &quot;Ceratotherium germanoafricanum&quot; for remains spanning around 3-1 million years ago in East Africa and suggest that this species may be ancestral to the living white rhinoceros, though other authors have considered it a subspecies of the white rhinoceros or assigned these remains to other species like &quot;C. mauritanicum.&quot;

The species &quot;&#x27;Ceratotherium’ advenientis&quot; is known from the Late Miocene of southern Italy (when it was still part of Africa). The species &quot;&quot;Ceratotherium&quot; douariense&quot;, known from the late Miocene of Tunisia, dating to around 7 million years ago, has been assigned to the genus by some authors. Its genus placement is disputed, with other authors placing the species in the genus &quot;Diceros&quot; as &quot;Diceros douariensis.&quot; The species &quot;Ceratotherium? primaevum&quot; has been reported from Algeria dating to around 10 million years ago, with other possible remains reported from East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya).

The earliest remains of the white rhinoceros date to the Early Pleistocene in East Africa, around 1-2 million years ago, depending on what remains are included in the species.

<text>The Ma On Shan line () was a commuter rail / rapid transit line that formed part of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong. Coloured brown on the MTR map, the line acted as a branch of the East Rail line that connects the new towns of Sha Tin and Ma On Shan in the northeastern New Territories.

The railway was one of three built by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), which named it as Ma On Shan Rail (, abbreviated as ). Since KCRC&#x27;s merger of operations with the MTR Corporation on 2 December 2007, the line has been operated as part of the MTR network. Along with the West Rail line, the line was integrated into Tuen Ma line Phase 1 on 14 February 2020 following the partial opening of the Sha Tin to Central Link.

==Overview and current status==
Construction of the Ma On Shan line began on 12 February 2001 and it fully opened for service on 21 December 2004, 3 days earlier than the proposed opening date. KCRC estimated the construction costs to be HK$10 billion. Over a thousand passengers took the first train from Tai Wai on the first day of service. Since then, the usage of buses and taxis in the area decreased by as much as 50%. It was reported that some bus routes operated by KMB saw a decrease of ridership by one-third in just a few days.

Since the early planning stages, the Ma On Shan line was designed to be capable of joining with the West Rail line. Under Phase 1 the Sha Tin to Central Link project, the Ma On Shan line would be extended from Tai Wai station to Hung Hom station via East Kowloon, with six new intermediate stations, including interchanges with the Kwun Tong line at Diamond Hill and Ho Man Tin, an additional interchange with the East Rail line at Hung Hom, and a new station, Hin Keng, serving Sha Tin. The extension will connect to the West Rail line at Hung Hom and continue on to Tuen Mun station in the northwest New Territories via the current West Rail line and its 2009 extension to Hung Hom). Due to various delays, the new line opened only as far as Kai Tak on 14 February 2020, with the remaining section to Hung Hom to begin service on 27 June 2021.

After the opening of the Tuen Ma line Phase 1 on 14 February 2020, the Ma On Shan line became part of the new line with three new stations in Hin Keng, Diamond Hill and Kai Tak. While technically still in operation, the name &quot;Ma On Shan line&quot; is no longer in use.

Both the SP1900 and East West line C-trains in eight-car formations will run on the conjoined line, now known as the Tuen Ma line, resulting in the platforms of the Ma On Shan line being lengthened from 2014 to 2016 to accommodate the longer trains and automatic platform gates by Gilgen Door Systems (part of Nabtesco Corporation) retrofitted on all platforms from 2014 to 2017. The SelTrac IS signalling system will also be upgraded to SelTrac CBTC, which equips the extension.

<text>Streetcore is the third and final studio album by Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros. The album was completed after the death of frontman Joe Strummer, primarily by Martin Slattery and Scott Shields, and released on 21 October 2003. The album marks the band&#x27;s transition from their previous genre-bending work to a more straightforward rock album, reminiscent of Strummer&#x27;s early work with the Clash. The album received a positive critical reception and is generally seen as a return to form and a high point for Strummer to have gone out on.

A remastered version of the album along with Strummer&#x27;s other two Hellcat released albums was released as a special 57 song digital download titled &quot;Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros: The Hellcat Years&quot; on 21 August 2012 to celebrate what would have been Strummer&#x27;s 60th birthday. Hellcat also released each remastered album individually on CD and vinyl on 25 September 2012.

==Song information==
Due to Strummer&#x27;s death, many of the vocal performances are first takes. &quot;Midnight Jam&quot; is completely without lyrics – instead, samplings of Joe&#x27;s BBC Radio show &quot;Joe Strummer&#x27;s London Calling&quot; are intermixed with the music. Other tracks, such as a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and &quot;Long Shadow&quot;, were recorded with famed producer Rick Rubin, and it is unclear whether or not these tracks were originally intended to be on this album. Another notable track is &quot;Long Shadow&quot;, which was originally written by Strummer for Johnny Cash. Rubin would however get Strummer and Cash, who died a year after Strummer, together in the studio as the two recorded a version of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; that was featured on Cash&#x27;s posthumously released &quot;Unearthed&quot; box set.

Music videos were released for the album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Coma Girl&quot; and &quot;Redemption Song&quot;. The video for &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, which was directed by Josh Cheuse, who designed the cover art for Strummer&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot; and who also appears in the video, is a tribute to Strummer&#x27;s life and legacy. Filmed in November 2003 in Manhattan in the East Village, the video opens with a clip of Strummer talking from The Clash documentary &quot;Westway to the World&quot;, with the focus of the video being a mural of Strummer that was painted by graffiti artists Zephyr and Dr. Revolt outside Niagra, a bar owned by musician Jesse Malin. The video also features many New Yorkers, along with some of Strummer&#x27;s closest famous friends including Malin, Matt Dillon, Steve Buscemi, Jim Jarmusch, Tim Armstrong, Lars Fredriksen, Matt Freeman, Cara Seymour, Sara Driver and Cinqué Lee as they watch the mural being painted. Stock footage and photos of Strummer from his tenure with The Clash and Mescaleros is also featured.

==Reception==
===Critical===
The album received a positive critical reception and is generally seen as a return to form for Joe Strummer that sees him going out on a high point. AllMusic wrote &quot;Like Muddy Waters, whose final albums were among the best in his catalog, &quot;Streetcore&quot;... sends Strummer into rock &amp; roll heaven a roaring, laughing, snarling lion&quot;, calling the album &quot;truly the finest, most cohesive work he did after &quot;London Calling&quot;.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote &quot;Streetcore is an amalgam of all that made Joe Strummer, the musician and the man, so great.&quot;

===Impact===
Strummer&#x27;s cover of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; was featured as outro music for the Red Hot Chili Peppers during their historic show at Slane Castle and can be heard on their 2003 live DVD, &quot;Live at Slane Castle&quot;.

The song &quot;Coma Girl&quot; was performed as the opening track at Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s performance at the Glastonbury Festival on 27 June 2009. &quot;Coma Girl&quot; was also covered by The Loved Ones on their EP &quot;Distractions&quot;.

&quot;Arms Aloft&quot; has been covered by American rock band Pearl Jam and a live recording is featured on their 2011 live album, &quot;Live on Ten Legs&quot;. 

&quot;Ramshackle Day Parade&quot;, the fifth song of the album, was featured on the acclaimed movie &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;.

<text>New Spitalfields Market is a fruit and vegetable market on a site in Leyton, London Borough of Waltham Forest in East London. The market is owned and administered by the City of London Corporation. The market is Europe&#x27;s leading horticultural market specialising in exotic fruit and vegetables - and the largest revenue earning wholesale market in the UK.

== History ==
It had previously been located at Spitalfields Market just off Bishopsgate, on the east side of the City of London in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Due to traffic congestion, lack of space for parking lorries, as well as out of date market buildings (e.g. poor refrigeration facilities) - the market was relocated out of the Tower Hamlets in the early 1990s. This followed the move of Covent Garden Market and Billingsgate Fish Market out of the city centre. The new, purpose-built location in Leyton opened in May 1991.

The wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Stratford Market - founded in 1879 by the Great Eastern Railway as a competitor to Spitalfields - also closed and consolidated at the New Spitalfields site. The old market on the edge of the city was subsequently regenerated, becoming Old Spitalfields Market - with a range of public markets as well as independent local stores and restaurants.

== The market today ==
The market hall houses 115 trading units for wholesalers dealing in fruit, vegetables and flowers. Modern facilities in the market hall include cold storage rooms, ripening rooms and racking for palletised produce. The site has extensive parking facilities for customers, delivery vehicles and market personnel.

There are four separate buildings providing modern self-contained units for catering supply companies. Over of office space is also provided, and there are five ancillary accommodation units with cafes, toilets and maintenance facilities. The services of a diesel/propane supplier, specialist pallet services and forklift truck maintenance companies are also available. Security for the market is provided by the Market Constabulary.

The Old River Lea runs on the western edge of the site.

==Future==
In early 2019, the City of London Corporation&#x27;s main decision-making body, the Court of Common Council, proposed that Billingsgate Fish Market, New Spitalfields Market and Smithfield Market should move to a new consolidated site in Dagenham Dock. A formal planning application was made in June 2020, and received outline permission in March 2021.

However, in November 2024, the Court of Common Council announced it did not intend to proceed with these plans as they were no longer economically viable; instead, Billingsgate Fish Market and Smithfield Market would close in or after 2028 with no replacements. New Spitalfields Market was unaffected by the decision and would continue as a key London hub for wholesale fruit and vegetable produce.

<doc id="981422" wikidata="Q17305063" url="?curid=981422" title="Piano tuning">
<text>Piano tuning is the process of adjusting the tension of the strings of an acoustic piano so that the musical intervals between strings are in tune. The meaning of the term &#x27;in tune&#x27;, in the context of piano tuning, is not simply a particular fixed set of pitches. Fine piano tuning requires an assessment of the vibration interaction among notes, which is different for every piano, thus in practice requiring slightly different pitches from any theoretical standard. Pianos are usually tuned to a modified version of the system called equal temperament. (See Piano key frequencies for the theoretical piano tuning.)

In all systems of tuning, every pitch may be derived from its relationship to a chosen fixed pitch, which is usually A440 (440 Hz), the note A above middle C. For a classical piano and musical theory, the middle C is usually labelled as C4 (as in scientific pitch notation); However, in the MIDI standard definition this middle C (261.626 Hz) is labelled C3. In practice, a MIDI software can label middle C as C3-C5, which can cause confusion, especially for beginners.

Piano tuning is done by a wide range of independent piano technicians, piano rebuilders, piano-store technical personnel, and hobbyists. Professional training and certification is available from organizations or guilds, such as the Piano Technicians Guild. Many piano manufacturers recommend that pianos be tuned twice a year.

==Background==

Many factors cause pianos to go out of tune, particularly atmospheric changes. For instance, changes in humidity will affect the pitch of a piano; high humidity causes the sound board to swell, stretching the strings and causing the pitch to go sharp, while low humidity has the opposite effect. Changes in temperature can also affect the overall pitch of a piano. In newer pianos the strings gradually stretch and wooden parts compress, causing the piano to go flat, while in older pianos the tuning pins (that hold the strings in tune) can become loose and not hold the piano in tune as well. Frequent and hard playing can also cause a piano to go out of tune. For these reasons, many piano manufacturers recommend that new pianos be tuned four times during the first year and twice a year thereafter.

An out-of-tune piano can often be identified by the characteristic &quot;honky tonk&quot; or beating sound it produces. This fluctuation in the sound intensity is a result of two (or more) tones of similar frequencies being played together. For example, if a piano string tuned to 440 Hz (vibrations per second) is played together with a piano string tuned to 442 Hz, the resulting tone beats at a frequency of 2 Hz, due to the constructive and destructive interference between the two sound waves. Likewise, if a string tuned to 220 Hz (with a harmonic at 440 Hz) is played together with a string tuned at 442 Hz, the same 2 Hz beat is heard. Because pianos typically have multiple strings for each piano key, these strings must be tuned to the same frequency to eliminate beats.

The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency of vibrations. For a vibrating string, the frequency is determined by the string&#x27;s length, mass, and tension. Piano strings are wrapped around tuning pins, which are turned to adjust the tension of the strings.

=== History ===
Piano tuning became a profession around the beginning of the 1800s, as the &quot;pianoforte&quot; became mainstream. Previously musicians owned harpsichords, which were much easier to tune, and which the musicians generally tuned themselves. Early piano tuners were trained and employed in piano factories, and often underwent an apprenticeship of about 5–7 years. Early tuners faced challenges related to a large variety of new and changing pianos and non-standardized pitches.

Historically, keyboard instruments were tuned using just intonation, pythagorean tuning and meantone temperament meaning that such instruments could sound &quot;in tune&quot; in one key, or some keys, but would then have more dissonance in other keys. The development of well temperament allowed fixed-pitch instruments to play reasonably well in all of the keys. The famous &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach took advantage of this breakthrough, with preludes and fugues written for all 24 major and minor keys. However, while unpleasant intervals (such as the wolf interval) were avoided, the sizes of intervals were still not consistent between keys, and so each key still had its own distinctive character. During the 1800s this variation led to an increase in the use of quasi- equal temperament, in which the frequency ratio between each pair of adjacent notes on the keyboard were nearly equal, allowing music to be transposed between keys without changing the relationship between notes.

Pianos are generally tuned to an A440 pitch standard that was adopted during the early 20th century in response to widely varying standards. Previously the pitch standards had gradually risen from about A415 during the late 18th century and early 19th century to A435 during the late 19th century. Though A440 is generally the standard, some orchestras, particularly in Europe, use a higher pitch standard, such as A442.

==Theory==

===Overtones and harmonics===
A stretched string can vibrate in different modes, or harmonics, and when a piano hammer strikes a string it excites multiple harmonics at the same time. The first harmonic (or fundamental frequency) is usually the loudest, and determines the pitch that is perceived. In theory the higher harmonics (also called overtones or partials) vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. (e.g. a string with a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz would have overtones at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, etc.) In reality, the frequencies of the overtones are shifted up slightly, due to inharmonicity caused by the stiffness of the strings.

The relationship between two pitches, called an interval, is the ratio of their absolute frequencies. The easiest intervals to identify and tune are those where the note frequencies have a simple whole-number ratio (e.g. octave with a 2:1 ratio, perfect fifth with 3:2, etc.) because the harmonics of these intervals coincide and beat when they are out of tune. (For a perfect fifth, the 3rd harmonic of the lower note coincides with the 2nd harmonic of the top note.)

===Temperament===
The term &quot;temperament&quot; refers to a tuning system that allows intervals to beat instead of tuning pure or &quot;just intervals&quot;. In equal temperament, for instance, a fifth would be tempered by narrowing it slightly, achieved by flattening its upper pitch slightly, or raising its lower pitch slightly.

Tempering an interval causes it to beat. Because the actual tone of a vibrating piano string is not just one pitch, but a complex of tones arranged in a harmonic series, two strings that are close to a simple harmonic ratio such as a perfect fifth beat at higher pitches (at their coincident harmonics), because of the difference in pitch between their coincident harmonics. Where these frequencies can be calculated, a temperament may be tuned aurally by timing the beatings of tempered intervals.

A common method of tuning the piano begins with tuning all the notes in the &quot;temperament&quot; octave in the lower middle range of the piano, usually F3 to F4. A tuner starts by using an external reference, usually an A440 tuning fork, (or commonly a C523.23 tuning fork) to tune a beginning pitch, and then tunes the other notes in the &quot;temperament&quot; using tempered interval relationships. During tuning it is common to assess perfect fifths and fourths, major and minor thirds, and major and minor sixths, often playing the intervals in an ascending or descending pattern to hear whether an even progression of beat rates has been achieved.

Having established the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, the technician then replicates the temperament throughout the piano by tuning octaves and cross-checking with other intervals, to align each note with others that have already been tuned.

Electronic piano tuning devices are also commonly used. They are designed to adjust the same tonal complexities that the aural tuner encounters. The devices use sophisticated algorithms to continuously test the harmonic makeup of each string as it is sounded, and apply the derived information to determine its optimal pitch within the context of the entire instrument.

The following table lists theoretical beat frequencies between notes in an equal temperament octave. The top row indicates absolute frequencies of the pitches; usually only A440 is determined from an external reference. Every other number indicates the beat rate between any two tones (which share the row and column with that number) in the temperament octave. Slower beat rates can be carefully timed with a metronome, or other such device. For the thirds in the temperament octave, it is difficult to tune so many beats per second, but after setting the temperament and duplicating it one octave below, all of these beat frequencies are present at half the indicated rate in this lower octave, which are excellent for verification that the temperament is correct. One of the easiest tests of equal temperament is to play a succession of major thirds, each one a semitone higher than the last. If equal temperament has been achieved, the beat rate of these thirds should increase evenly in the temperament region.

The next table indicates the pitch at which the strongest beating should occur for useful intervals. As described above, when tuning a perfect fifth, for instance, the beating can be heard not at either of the fundamental pitches of the keys played, but rather an octave and fifth (perfect twelfth) above the lower of the two keys, which is the lowest pitch at which their harmonic series overlap. Once the beating can be heard, the tuner must temper the interval either wide or narrow from a tuning that has no beatings.

===Stretch===

The tuning described by the above beating plan provides a good approximation of equal temperament across the range of the temperament octave. If extended further, however, the actual tuning of the instrument becomes increasingly inaccurate because of deviation of the real partials from the theoretical harmonics, pianos&#x27; partials run slightly sharp, as increasingly higher orders of the harmonic series are reached. This problem is mitigated by &quot;stretching&quot; the octaves as one tunes above (and to an extent below) the temperament region. When octaves are stretched, they are not tuned to the lowest coincidental overtone (second partial) of the note below, but instead to a higher overtone (often the 4th partial). This widens all intervals equally, thereby maintaining intervallic and tonal consistency.

All western music, but western classical literature in particular, requires this deviation from the theoretical equal temperament because the music is rarely played within a single octave. A pianist constantly plays notes spread over three and four octaves, at least, so it is critical that the mid and upper range of the treble be &quot;stretched&quot;, or widened, to better match with the &quot;inharmonic&quot; overtones of lower registers. Since the stretch of octaves is perceived and not measured, the tuner determines which octave needs more or less octave stretching &quot;by ear&quot;. Good tuning requires compromise between tonal brilliance, accurate intonation, and an awareness of gradation of timbre through the compass of the instrument. The name of this modification of the width of the scale is called the &quot;piano tuners&#x27; octave&quot;, as opposed to the simple 2:1 octave expected from a (theoretical) harmonic oscillator.

The amount of &quot;stretching&quot; necessary to achieve the desired compromise is a complicated determination described theoretically as a function of &quot;string scaling&quot;. String scaling considers the string&#x27;s tension, length, diameter, weight per unit length, and in elasticity in either the strings&#x27; core wires or any overwinding used to modify the wire&#x27;s weight. The overwindings are normally made from a denser, heavier, but less &quot;springy&quot; metal than the steel used for the core. Imperfect &quot;springiness&quot; anywhere in the string wire makes its partials deviate slightly from mathematically pure harmonics, and no real material used to generating musical tones is &quot;perfectly&quot; elastic. The Railsback curve is the result of measuring the fundamental frequencies of stretched tunings and plotting their deviations from unstretched equal temperament.

In small pianos the inharmonicity is so extreme that establishing a stretch based on a triple octave makes the single octaves beat noticeably, and the wide, fast beating intervals in the upper treble beat wildly – especially major 17ths (two octaves + a major 3rd). By necessity the tuner will attempt to limit the stretch. In large pianos like concert grands, less inharmonicity allows for a more complete string stretch without negatively affecting close octaves and other intervals. So while it may be true that the smaller piano receives a greater stretch relative to the fundamental pitch, only the concert grand&#x27;s octaves can be fully widened so that triple octaves are beatless. This contributes to the response, brilliance, and &quot;singing&quot; quality that concert grands offer.

A benefit of stretching octaves is the correction of dissonance that equal temperament imparts to the perfect fifth. Without octave stretching, the slow, nearly imperceptible beating of fifths in the temperament region (ranging from little more than one beat every two seconds to about one per second) would double each ascending octave. At the top of the keyboard, then, the theoretically (and ideally) pure fifth would be beating more than eight times per second. Modern western ears easily tolerate fast beating in non-just intervals (seconds and sevenths, thirds and sixths), but not in perfect octaves or fifths. Happily for pianists, the string stretch that accommodates inharmonicity on a concert grand also nearly exactly mitigates the accumulation of dissonance in the perfect fifth.

Other factors, physical and psychoacoustic, affect the tuner&#x27;s ability to achieve a temperament. Among physical factors are inharmonic effects due to soundboard resonance in the bass strings, poorly manufactured strings, or peculiarities that can cause &quot;false beats&quot; (false because they are unrelated to the manipulation of beats during tuning). The principal psychoacoustic factor is that the human ear tends to perceive the higher notes as being flat when compared to those in the midrange. Stretching the tuning to account for string inharmonicity is often not sufficient to overcome this phenomenon, so piano tuners may stretch the top octave or so of the piano even more.

==Tools and methods==
Common tools for tuning pianos include the tuning lever or &quot;hammer&quot;, a variety of mutes, and a tuning fork or electronic tuning device. The tuning lever is used to turn and &#x27;set&#x27; the tuning pins, increasing or decreasing the tension of the string. Mutes are used to silence strings that are not being tuned. While tuning the temperament octave, a felt strip is typically placed within the temperament (middle) section of the piano; it is inserted between each note&#x27;s trichord, muting its outer two strings so that only the middle string is free to vibrate. A Papps mute performs the same function in an upright piano and is placed through the piano action to mute either the 2 left strings (of a trichord), or the 2 right strings similarly. After the center strings are all tuned (or right if a Papps mute is used) the felt strip can be removed note by note, tuning the outer strings to the center strings. Wedge-shaped mutes are inserted between two strings to mute them, and the Papps mute is commonly used for tuning the high notes in upright pianos because it slides more easily between hammer shanks.

In an aural tuning a tuning fork is used to tune the first note (generally A4) of the piano, and then a temperament octave is tuned between F3 and F4 using a variety of intervals and checks, until the tuner is satisfied that all the notes in the octave are correctly tuned. The rest of the piano is then tuned to the temperament octave, using octaves and other intervals as checks.

If an electronic tuning device is used, the temperament step might be skipped, as it is possible for the tuner to adjust notes directly with the tuning device in any reasonable order.

<doc id="981426" wikidata="Q4765194" url="?curid=981426" title="Animistic fallacy">
<text>The animistic fallacy is the informal fallacy of arguing that an event or situation necessarily arose because someone intentionally acted to cause it. While it could be that someone set out to effect a specific goal, the fallacy appears in an argument that states this &quot;must&quot; be the case. The name of the fallacy comes from the animistic belief that changes in the physical world are the work of conscious spirits.
==Examples==
Thomas Sowell in his book &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot; (1980) presents several arguments as examples of the animistic fallacy:
* that people earn wealth always because of superior choices
* that central planning is necessary to prevent chaos in society

Sowell repeatedly dismisses the necessity that order comes from design, and notes that fallacious animistic arguments tend to provide explanations that require comparatively little time to implement. In this light he contrasts the six-day creation of the world described in the Bible to the development of life over billions of years described by evolution.

<text>Mariánské Lázně (; ) is a spa town in Cheb District in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 14,000 inhabitants. Most of the town&#x27;s buildings come from its Golden Era in the second half of the 19th century, when many celebrities and top European rulers came to enjoy the curative carbon dioxide springs.

The town centre with the spa cultural landscape is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation. In 2021, the town became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot; because of its springs and architectural testimony to the popularity of spa towns in Europe during the 18th through 20th centuries.

==Administrative division==
Mariánské Lázně consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Mariánské Lázně (5,037)
*Chotěnov-Skláře (109)
*Hamrníky (661)
*Kladská (32)
*Stanoviště (71)
*Úšovice (6,069)
==Etymology==
Both the initial German name Marienbad and the modern Czech name Mariánské Lázně means &#x27;Mary&#x27;s spa&#x27;. It was originally the name of a mineral spring, near which the pious people hung an image of the Virgin Mary.

==Geography==
Mariánské Lázně is located about southeast of Cheb and southwest of Karlovy Vary. The municipal territory extends into three geomorphological regions: the eastern part lies in a hilly landscape of the Teplá Highlands, the southwestern part with most of the built-up area lies in a flat area of the Upper Palatine Forest Foothills, and the northern tip lies in the Slavkov Forest. Most of the territory lies in the Slavkov Forest Protected Landscape Area.

The Teplá River originates in the woods in the northeastern part of the municipal territory. The stream Kosový potok flows through the southern part of Mariánské Lázně. Its tributary, the stream Úšovický potok, flows through the town proper.

==History==

German settlers were called into this region by Bohemian rulers from the Přemyslid dynasty in the 12th century.

Although the town itself is only about two hundred years old, the locality has been inhabited much longer. The first written record dates back to 1273, when there was a village of Úšovice. The springs first appear in a document dating from 1341 where they are called &quot;the Auschowitzer springs&quot; belonging to the Teplá Abbey. It was only through the efforts of Josef Nehr, the abbey&#x27;s physician, who from 1779 until his death in 1820 worked hard to demonstrate the curative properties of the springs, that the waters began to be used for medicinal purposes. The place obtained its current name of Marienbad in 1808; became a watering-place in 1818, and received its charter as a town in 1868.

By the early 20th century, approximately 1,000,000 bottles of mineral water were exported annually from Marienbad. The water from the Cross Spring (&quot;Kreuzquelle, Křížový pramen&quot;) was evaporated and the final product was sold as a laxative under the name of &quot;sal teplensis&quot;. The modern spa town was founded by the Teplá abbots, namely Karl Kaspar Reitenberger, who also bought some of the surrounding forests to protect them. The inhospitable marshland valley was changed into a park-like countryside with colonnades, neoclassical buildings and pavilions around the springs.

The name Marienbad first appeared in 1786; since 1865 it has been a town. Then came a second period of growth, the town&#x27;s Golden Era. Between 1870 and 1914 many new hotels, colonnades and other buildings were constructed or rebuilt from older houses. In 1872 the town got a railway connection with the town of Cheb and thus with the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire and the rest of Europe.

The town soon became one of the top European spas, popular with notable figures and rulers who often returned there. At that time, about 20,000 visitors came every year. It was also a popular resort and vacation venue for European rabbis and their Hasidic followers, accommodating their needs with kosher restaurants, religious prayer services, etc.

Marienbad remained a popular destination between World War I and World War II. After World War II, the ethnic German population of the town was forcibly expelled according to the Potsdam Agreement, thereby emptying the town of the majority of its population. After the communist coup-d&#x27;état in 1948, it was sealed off from most of its foreign visitors. After the return of democracy in 1989 much effort was put into restoring the town to its original character. Today it is a spa town and a popular holiday resort thanks to its location among the green mountains of the Slavkovský les and the Český les, sports facilities (the town&#x27;s first golf course was opened in 1905 by the British King Edward VII) and the proximity to other spa towns, such as Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad) and Františkovy Lázně (Franzensbad).

==Demographics==
Until their expulsion in 1945, the majority of the population of the town were German. Afterwards, the Czechoslovak authorities repopulated the town with Czechs from the hinterland.

==Transport==
Mariánské Lázně is located on three important railway lines: Prague–Cheb, Plzeň–Karlovy Vary and Františkovy Lázně–Bohumín.

Mariánské Lázně Airport is situated on the southern border of the town.

===Public transport===
The town&#x27;s public transport is operated mainly by trolleybuses and accompanied by buses servicing the neighbouring villages. There are four trolleybus lines and four bus lines in operation.

==Sport==
The town is represented by the football team FC Viktoria Mariánské Lázně, founded in 1945. It plays in lower amateur tiers.

Mariánské Lázně has a motorcycle speedway racing circuit. The venue, Mariánské Lázně Longtrack Speedway, hosted six Long Track World Champion finals from 1976 to 1994 and five rounds of Grand-Prix racing (the most recent in 2011).

The town is known for the Royal Golf Club Mariánské Lázně.

==Sights==

===Mineral springs and colonnades===
The top attraction of the town is its 100 mineral springs (53 of them are tapped) with high carbon dioxide content and often also higher iron content, both in the town itself (40 springs) and its surroundings. The water in the springs has an average temperature of 7–10 °C, and is formed through interactions with the deep fault lines that run under the region. The mineral water is claimed to cure disorders of the kidneys and of the urinary tract, respiratory disorders, locomotive system disorders, metabolic disorders, oncological disorders and gynaecological disorders, including the treatment of sterility.

Many of the springs have pavilions and colonnades built around them. Among them are:
* &quot;Křížový pramen&quot; (Cross Spring) – a monumental pavilion with a cupola bearing a patriarchal cross and 72 Ionic columns was built over the spring in 1818–1826. Today&#x27;s concrete building is a copy from 1911–1912, originally it was a light wooden and brick construction. The water from the spring is highly mineralized with a strong laxative effect, and has been used for both curative drinks and baths.
* &quot;Rudolfův pramen&quot; (Rudolph&#x27;s Spring) – with a wooden pavilion built over the spring, some water is tapped and piped to the nearby colonnade and some is bottled. Its water is weakly mineralized with high calcium content and has been used to cure urinary problems.
* &quot;Karolinin pramen&quot; (Caroline&#x27;s Spring) – named after the wife of the Emperor Francis I, Caroline Augusta. The nearby colonnade was built in 1869, the pavilion is a reconstruction from 1989. The water is weakly mineralized, with higher magnesium content.
* &quot;Ferdinandův pramen&quot; (Ferdinand&#x27;s Spring) – the water from the spring, similar in composition to &quot;Křížový pramen&quot;, is bottled under the Excelsior label.
* &quot;Ambrožovy prameny&quot; (Ambrose&#x27;s Springs)
* &quot;Lesní pramen&quot; (Forest Spring)
* &quot;Zpívající fontána&quot; (Singing Fountain)

The total yield of all of the springs is roughly 600 liters per minute.

===Churches===
Because of the diverse number of visitors the town is able to maintain churches of several denominations. These include the Anglican Church designed by the notable Victorian architect William Burges and founded by Lady Anna Scott in memory of her husband who died in Mariánské Lázně in 1867. The church was constructed in 1879, shortly before Burges&#x27;s own death. It is no longer in use as a place of worship and is now a concert hall.

==Notable people==
*Maurice Loewy (1833–1907), astronomer
*Werner Stark (1909–1985), sociologist and economist
*Eduard Petiška (1924–1987), poet and author
*Peter Hofmann (1944–2010), German tenor

<text>Theoretical psychology is concerned with theoretical and philosophical aspects of psychology. It is an interdisciplinary field with a wide scope of study. 

It focuses on combining and incorporating existing and developing theories of psychology non-experimentally. Theoretical psychology originated from the philosophy of science, with logic and rationality at the base of each new idea. It existed before empirical or experimental psychology. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in a wide variety of psychological branches. There have been a few prominent pioneers of theoretical psychology such as Wilhelm Wundt, William James, Sigmund Freud, and John B. Watson. There has also been a number of notable contributors which include Jerome Kagan, Alan E. Kazdin, Robert Sternberg, Kenneth J. Gergen, and Ulric Neisser. These contributors may publish in a variety of journals, including journals for general psychology, like &quot;American Psychologist&quot;. There are several journals dedicated specifically to theoretical psychology, like &quot;Theory &amp; Psychology&quot; and &quot;Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology&quot;. Many other organizations are beginning to recognize theoretical psychology as a formal subdivision of psychology.

==Origin==

Theoretical psychology emerged from philosophy, more specifically from the philosophy of science. Philosophy strives to understand nature and structure of concepts, the laws in which these concepts occur, and the theories that combine the laws together. One of these specific branches of philosophy of science is theoretical psychology. Philosophy of science does not use the scientific method to empirically derive ideas about the physical world through conducting experiments and interpreting results. However, it is still about science with an emphasis on the logic and rationality behind science itself, bringing to light what cannot be explained by empirical measures. It is also metaphysically and epistemologically focused on all humans while incorporating the nature and essence of human knowledge. Just as the philosophy of science is to science, theoretical psychology is to psychology in that it is the logic and rationality applied to concepts, laws, and theories. Theoretical psychology is not in place to discern which theories are more truthful or more correct. Many consider theoretical psychology as the support or rationalization of an &quot;idea&quot; within psychological theory that is more &quot;truthful&quot;. However, this is not the case. Theoretical psychology is scientifically grounded in ideas of what is known through epistemology.
Theoretical psychology existed long before any branches of traditional empirical and experimental psychology. As a result, there is much more depth and breadth of knowledge from which to draw, making it less common for new developments to come about in the present day because many &quot;new&quot; approaches are drawing from and revitalizing past theories. In doing so, new knowledge, frames of reference, and mindsets are brought to these foundational theories. This may be due to ideas taking longer to develop and gain momentum than related fields in empirical based psychology.

==Relationship to philosophy and scope==

Theoretical psychology is a rational, non-experimental approach to psychology. In psychology, as with any field of study, there are three philosophical perspectives and methodologies of ways to derive knowledge about the reality of the world. Rationalism (use of intellect and reason of the mind), Empiricism (use of our individually experienced sensorium), and Skepticism (knowledge beyond mere appearance that is not able to be studied) characterize the three perspectives in understanding theoretical concepts relating to laws which help to understand larger theoretical theories.

Of the philosophical perspectives, rationalism is the most pertinent to this discipline of psychology. Theoretical psychology is not experimental or clinically based and focuses on non-experimental ways to acquire knowledge about psychological topics. It explores the theoretical knowledge behind its encompassed ideologies. Oftentimes this includes, but is not limited to, non-experimental critiques to different schools of thought, and the usefulness of psychological concepts. Theoretical psychology is a discipline that bases its information through inference, as opposed to empirically acquired information. Hypotheses are then exchanged and further built upon from different perspectives. Theoretical Psychology also deals with manipulating non-scientific, common words (hypothetical constructs) into scientifically objective terms (intervening variables). Theoretical psychology requires full agreement on the different viewpoints to be able to see the point as a theory. As a result, many of its topics remain in continuous debate.

Theoretical psychology is the logic of psychology and all of its components. This means when theories within psychology oppose or compete, theoretical psychology does not select which is correct. It describes the nature and composition of psychology&#x27;s many ideas. To explain the logic of psychology, there has been a conclusion of the principles belonging to the three classified areas. Psychology is built on the principle of being able to reference observable behavior, physical environment, and/or physiological states. Theoretical psychology is an important aspect that continues to play a role in modern psychology. While there are some downfalls to theoretical psychology, there are also strengths and benefits it brings to the field.

The scope that theoretical psychology covers is vast. Professionals have the opportunity to use this method of seeking out theoretical knowledge to begin research in a variety of subjects. This allows for a great deal of knowledge to be explored by means of inference rather than seeking out tangible data to draw ideas. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in cognitive psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, personality psychology, clinical psychology, perceptual psychology, neuropsychology, biological psychology, evolutionary psychology, historical psychology, economic psychology, political psychology, and critical psychology. It is important to acknowledge these fields do not discount empiricism, but rather explore new ideas with a theoretical approach first.

==Pioneers==

A brief history into the field of theoretical psychology includes some prominent pioneers. To begin, Wilhelm Wundt (1874) originally worked as a professor of philosophy. His focus was on the subjective study of an individual&#x27;s consciousness, he believed that this was a key factor to the field of psychology. This aspect of psychology was unable to be shown with a large amount of empirical evidence, but remained a theory throughout the history of Psychology. Next, William James (1890) worked as a psychologist and a philosopher. His career focused around the idea of free will, which is theoretical in nature. He also assisted in forming the James-Lange theory of emotion, which is based upon many theoretical factors. Sigmund Freud (1905) was also an important pioneer for theoretical psychology. Freud founded the psychoanalytic theory of psychology. He did not rely on empirical data when making his theories, but instead looked for philosophical explanations. Freud often shared his view that he did not need empirical evidence for his theory, because he simply knew it is true. Another pioneer was John B. Watson (1913). Watson founded the theory of behaviorism in psychology through the article &quot;Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It&quot;. Although Behaviorism has a strong emphasis on empirical psychology, forming the methods cannot be empirically tested, and is therefore considered theoretical psychology.

==Notable contributors==

There are some notable individuals that have, and continue to make a large impact on theoretical psychology. Jerome Kagan&#x27;s (1971) work on personality traits and aging, emotion, and temperament could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology. As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information. Donald Meichenbaum (1977) had work that focused on cognitive behavioral therapy. Meichenbaum did the majority of his work in the field of cognitive psychology. He compared his theory to Pandora&#x27;s box. Its main focus is connecting cognitive processes and relations to things such as clients&#x27; feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes. Alan E. Kazdin (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent psychopathologies such as depression and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field. Robert Sternberg&#x27;s (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; creativity, wisdom, thinking styles, love, and hate. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work. Kenneth J. Gergen&#x27;s (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and relational being. He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on mental illness, and relations. Many of his idea&#x27;s were theoretical in nature. Ulric Neisser (1995) has work that&#x27;s related to cognitive psychology, specifically the idea of flashbulb memories. Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work. These individual&#x27;s and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas that may or may not be yet supported by empirical data.

==Modern organizational support==

The American Psychological Association has the division of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology as Division 24. Theoretical Ideas are also associated to the division of humanistic psychology (32). According to the American Psychological Association, &quot;Division 24: Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology encourages and facilitates informed exploration and discussion of psychological theories and issues in both their scientific and philosophical dimensions and interrelationships.&quot; The International Society for Theoretical Psychology, the Section of History and Philosophy of Psychology (25) of the Canadian Psychological Society, the Section of History and Philosophy of psychology of the British Psychological Society, the International Human Science Conference, and the Society for Philosophy and Psychology also offer organizational support. Universities that currently have Theoretical Psychology/Human Science programs include Duquesne University, the University of Dallas, Seattle University, West Georgia College, University of Calgary, University of Alberta, York University, Brigham Young University, University of Notre Dame and Georgetown University.

==Research methods==

Theoretical psychology works together with empirical psychology to form a symbiotic relationship. Theoretical psychology is not constrained by empirical research or laboratory studies. It allows for scientists to freely search for knowledge that we have yet to be able to study empirically or are not yet capable of studying empirically. For theoretical psychology, its strength lies in the realm of rationality, focused on big picture ideas. However, on its own it is not a complete way to gain particular knowledge of reality. This is where the empirical based branches of psychology has strength. Theoretical psychology can more heavily rely on an idea about human nature that is universal, even when it is not known why or how this particular trend happens in the world, either individualistically or collectively. Empirical psychology is what allows for humans to make insights on these big picture ideas at a more palatable, applicable and individualistic and way that gives practical information about reality. Theoretical psychology is not a universal psychological theory able to explain all topics without the use of empirical research. Theoretical psychology is not fundamental or comprehensive theory of psychology, rather, for theoretical psychology to operate correctly it is important to supplement empirical psychology and give reason to topics and produce theories until they can be empirically verified by the other branches of psychology.

==Issues in methodology and practice==

Humans have innate wonder, exploring many topics through experience and perception. From this wonder, individuals rationally reflects on their own experiences about a specific topic. Then the individual practices dialectics, examining what others have said about the topic being explored with the hopes of finding a particular knowledge about the topic. Theoretical psychology serves as the bridge between the philosophical roots of psychology and the present day empirical psychology. This bridge has an emphasis and focus on forming concepts from moments of explicit behavior that are observable, excluding introspective mental events within individual consciousness. Psychological laws are created from these observable behaviors that are derived from one concept that also contain concepts from the individual&#x27;s environment of internal physiological states. These laws are categorized into causal (statistical) or deterministic/mechanistic (nonstatistical) categories which relate simultaneous parallel traits or predict future from present or past respectively. Then these laws are organized into theories based on connections logically deduced together and open to new laws yet to be discovered or empirically verified. The ultimate and logically possible goal of theoretical psychology is to create an exact and comprehensive psychological theory. However, the concepts that are immediately observable are still abstract and difficult to define even in a basic law in an important solid theory as they relate to no physical object we can make sense of or interact with using our sensorium and empirical approaches. They are not instantiated in the world and in virtue of this they are called theoretical concepts.

==Significance==

Theoretical psychology has many aspects that can be viewed as positive or negative, which depends on the interpreter. Theoretical psychology can play an important and also unique role in the field such that almost any claim can be reasonably thought of as true if it is theoretically appealing and empirically supported by research. Theorists must be strategic and knowledgeable when shifting through experimental psychology as the field grows. This can be beneficial in the sense that individuals know theorists have made a deliberated effort when analyzing the research surrounding a theory. However, for those who are not familiar with the theoretical psychology surrounding a theory, the abundant amount of information contributing to a theory can be overwhelming. In addition, theories can be extremely resistant to change. As theories compete, and different evidence emerges, prior theories can be extremely difficult to change. This can make it difficult for new theories to gain traction within the field of psychology. This resiliency may in part be due to theories stated in ways that are worded too abstractly, ineffectively, and contradictory at times. One challenge of theoretical psychology is the difficulty to explain consciousness: there are many competing theories revolving around consciousness, and theoretical psychology struggles to fully explain or justify consciousness. Researchers have an extremely difficult time studying it, despite there being an entire field of psychology completely dedicated to consciousness. Theoretical psychology can be extremely beneficial because it brings together scientific ideas and philosophical ideas of psychology. Integrating these ideas contributes to the knowledge of psychology.

==Journals==

The fields of humanistic and existential, as well as the Social Constructionist perspective of psychology, all have been fundamental to some of the first theoretical ideas as it pertains to modern theoretical psychology.

<doc id="981441" wikidata="Q1392583" url="?curid=981441" title="Raul Seixas">
<text>Raul Santos Seixas (; 28 June 1945 – 21 August 1989) was a Brazilian rock musician foundational to the genre. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Brazil named Seixas among the greatest artists in Brazilian music.

Throughout his career, Seixas composed music in several genres, blending rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, folk, and ballads with variations of Northeastern Brazil rhythms like forró, baião, and xote. His 1968 debut album, Raulzito e os Panteras, was produced when he was part of a band of the same name. 

Several Raul Seixas songs emphasized philosophical, spiritual and mystical themes; his album &quot;Gita&quot; (1974) was influenced by figures such as Aleister Crowley. Several of his songs were co-written with future author Paulo Coelho.

==Life and career==
Seixas was born on 28 June 1945 in Salvador, Bahia, to a middle-class family. As a child living near the United States consulate, he became fluent in the English language, and was introduced to early rock and roll records of artists such as Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley through his contacts with American diplomats&#x27; children around 1956. Elvis&#x27;s music in particular was influential in young Raul&#x27;s decision to become a musician. At the age of twelve, Seixas formed his first group, The Panthers, later changing their name to the Portuguese-language Raulzito e os Panteras (&quot;Little Raul and The Panthers&quot;). They appeared on TV Itapoan doing covers of Lewis, Little Richard and Elvis, a style of music which was at the time called &quot;cowboy music&quot; in Brazil.

In the mid-1960s, Os Panteras started backing some of Brazil&#x27;s most famous pop singers of the time, such as Jerry Adriani whenever they went to Salvador. Impressed with their talent, the stars would always advise Raul to move down south and take a chance in the thriving Jovem Guarda scene.

Following the promises of fame and fortune, the band moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1967. In the following year they released their first and only album on the Odeon label (later EMI-Odeon), which included a Portuguese language version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; among many original numbers. Without any publicity, the record sunk and the band disbanded. Seixas was totally shaken by the failure of the Panteras, and his return to Salvador. He wrote: &quot;I spent all day locked in my room reading philosophy, with only a very feeble light, what ended up spoiling my eyesight [...] I bought a motorcycle and did crazy things in the street.&quot;

After his former bandmates moved back to Salvador, Seixas made a living as an English teacher before being hired by CBS, still in 1968, as creative director and record producer. In 1971, tired of writing and producing records by bland, commercial artists, he took advantage of a label director&#x27;s vacations and produced &quot;Sociedade da Grã-Ordem Kavernista Apresenta Sessão das Dez&quot;, an avant-garde album featuring himself, singer Sergio Sampaio, samba artist Miriam Batucada and Edy Star. The record&#x27;s mix of Tropicalia, rock and roll and anarchic surrealistic experiments launched Raul Seixas as an icon of Brazilian counterculture.

In the 1970s, Seixas became popular in urban centers such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Music broadcast on TV and radio was satirical, sarcastic with esoteric themes. References to a wide range of historical and fictional personalities are found within his lyrics: The Beatles, Aleister Crowley, Al Capone, Marlon Brando, Jesus, Julius Caesar and Shakespeare, for example. Seixas was subject to censorship during Brazil&#x27;s period of military dictatorship. Like the music of his contemporaries such as Chico Buarque and others, Seixas&#x27;s lyrics hide political messages within double meanings.

1971 also saw the beginning of a relationship with esoteric author Paulo Coelho, beginning with &quot;Krig-Há-Bandolo&quot; in 1973. Through Coelho, Seixas was introduced to the work of controversial English mystic Aleister Crowley, which influenced their collaboration. The influence extended not only to music, but also to plans for the creation of the &quot;Sociedade Alternativa&quot; (&quot;Alternative Society&quot;), which was to be an anarchist community in the state of Minas Gerais based on Crowley&#x27;s premise: &quot;&#x27;Do what thou wilt&#x27; shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; The project was considered subversive by members of the Brazilian military, which imprisoned all prospective members of the group. Seixas and Coelho are reported to have been tortured during their imprisonment.

Seixas got into self-exiling himself in the United States following the presumed detention by government repressive agents, where his American wife of the time was living. (Seixas was legally married twice to Edith Wisner and Gloria Vaquer Seixas.) He has three daughters. He would later claim that during his exile he had met his childhood heroes John Lennon and Jerry Lee Lewis, although this claim has been disputed.

===Late career and death===
Perhaps as a result of his drug addiction and alcoholism, the rate and quality of Seixas&#x27; releases slowed through the late-1970s and throughout the 1980s. In later life Seixas suffered from diabetes and pancreatitis. On Monday, 21 August 1989, at the age of 44, Seixas died of cardiac arrest, the result of acute pancreatitis brought on by his diabetes and not having taken insulin the night before. His final album, &quot;A Panela do Diabo&quot;, a partnership with fellow Bahian rocker Marcelo Nova (former leader of punk rock band Camisa de Vênus) was released two days before his death.

<text>Bruno Maderna (born Bruno Grossato, 21 April 1920 – 13 November 1973) was an Italian composer, conductor and academic teacher.

==Life==
Maderna was born Bruno Grossato in Venice but later decided to take the name of his mother, Caterina Carolina Maderna. At the age of four he began studying the violin with his grandfather. &quot;My grandfather thought that if you could play the violin you could then do anything, even become the biggest gangster. If you play the violin you are always sure of a place in heaven.&quot; As a child he played several instruments (violin, drums and accordion) in his father&#x27;s small variety band. A child prodigy, in the early thirties he was not only performing violin concertos, he was already conducting orchestral concerts: first with the orchestra of La Scala in Milan, then in Trieste, Venice, Padua and Verona. He was originally Jewish.

Orphaned at the age of four, Maderna was adopted by a wealthy woman from Verona, Irma Manfredi, who saw to that he received a solid musical education. He took private lessons in harmony and musical composition from Arrigo Pedrollo from 1935 until 1937 and studied composition with Alessandro Bustini at the Rome Conservatory from 1937 until 1940.

After Rome he returned to Venice, where he attended the advanced course for composers (1940–42) organised by Gian Francesco Malipiero at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory (his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra dates from this time). He also studied conducting with Antonio Guarnieri at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena (1941) and Hermann Scherchen in Venice (1948). Through Scherchen Maderna discovered twelve-tone technique and the music of the Second Viennese School.

During the Second World War he took part in the partisan resistance. From 1948 to 1952 he taught music theory at the Venice Conservatory. During this period he collaborated with Malipiero on critical editions of Italian early music. Fellow composers he met at this time included Luigi Dallapiccola and, at the Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik, Boulez, Messiaen, Cage, Pousseur, Nono and Stockhausen.

== Conductor/teacher ==
In 1950 Maderna started an international career as a conductor, first in Paris and Munich, then across Europe. In 1955 he founded the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano with Luciano Berio and Incontri musicali, a series of concerts disseminating contemporary music in Italy.

With his later wife Beate Christina Koepnick, a young actress from Darmstadt, Maderna had three children.

In 1957–58, at the invitation of Giorgio Federico Ghedini, he taught at the Milan Conservatory, and between 1960 and 1962 he lectured at Dartington International Summer School in England. From 1961 to 1966, Maderna and Pierre Boulez were the main directors of the International Kranichsteiner &quot;Kammerensemble&quot; in Darmstadt. Despite this heavy workload throughout these years Maderna found time to compose.

During the 1960s and &#x27;70s he spent much time in the United States, teaching and conducting. In 1971–72 he was appointed director of new music at Tanglewood. In 1972–73 he became the principal conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica of RAI in Milan.

Maderna died of lung cancer in Darmstadt in 1973, at the age of 53.
A number of composers wrote pieces in Maderna&#x27;s memory, including Pierre Boulez (&quot;Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna&quot;) and Luciano Berio (&quot;Calmo&quot; for voice and orchestra). Earle Brown&#x27;s &quot;Centering&quot;, dedicated to the memory of Maderna, ends with a short quotation from Maderna&#x27;s First Oboe Concerto.

==Work==
Maderna composed much music in all genres: instrumental, chamber, concertos and electronic, as well as large amounts of incidental music (for theatre and radio) and transcriptions and editions of early music.

At the heart of Maderna&#x27;s output are a number of concertos, including one for violin, one for two pianos, two for solo piano and several for flute and orchestra. He was particularly drawn to the oboe, composing three concertos in all: the first in 1962–63 followed by two more in 1967 and 1973.

Other major orchestral works include &quot;Aura&quot; and &quot;Biogramma&quot; (both 1967) and &quot;Quadrivium&quot;, for four percussionists and four orchestral groups (premiered at the 1969 Royan Festival). Giuseppe Sinopoli recorded all three of these pieces with the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1979. Maderna&#x27;s Requiem, composed between 1944 and 1946, was rediscovered and performed in 2009; the American composer Virgil Thomson saw an unfinished version of the score in 1946 and praised it as a masterpiece.

Bruno Maderna also produced scores for eight films and two documentaries. The last of these was for Giulio Questi&#x27;s thriller &quot;La morte ha fatto l&#x27;uovo&quot; in 1968.

His opera, &quot;Satyricon&quot;, was premiered in 1973.

Maderna was certainly also a prominent composer in genres such as electronic music, experimental music and avant-garde music. His work &quot;Musica su due dimensioni&quot; for flute, cymbals, and tape, which premiered at the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in 1952, is one of the earliest examples of a composer combining acoustic and electronic sounds.

The parish boundary includes the River Parrett which is crossed by the Bow Bridge. Next to it is Bow Mill House, with its attached watermill which dates from the 17th century. Tail Mill was used for sail cloth manufacture.

==History==

The name Merriott means &quot;boundary gate&quot; from the Old English &quot;Maergeat&quot;.

The manor was held at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 by Harding son of Eadnorth whose descendants took the name of the village and continued until the death of Sir John de Meriet in 1391. The good quality of the soil led to the development of market-gardening, with the first use in England of the word nursery (&quot;noresire&quot;) occurred at Merriot in 1369.

The parish was part of the hundred of Crewkerne.

Major rebuilding took place in the village following a fire in 1811.

The school building dates from 1876, and now incorporates the former Sunday school which was built in 1834.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The village falls within Eggwood electoral ward. &quot;Merriott&quot; is the most populous area but the ward stretches to Dinnington in the west. The total population for this ward taken at the 2011 census was 2,421.

It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican parish Church of All Saints dates from the 13th century, with modifications in the late 15th or early 16th century, and major restoration including the extension of the nave, a new chancel and chapels by Benjamin Ferrey in 1860. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

==Notable people==
* Francis Trask (1840 – 6 April 1910) was a 20th-century Member of the New Zealand Legislative Council and Mayor of Nelson.

<doc id="981453" wikidata="Q3008321" url="?curid=981453" title="The Tales of Alvin Maker">
<text>The Tales of Alvin Maker is a series of six alternate history fantasy novels written by American novelist Orson Scott Card, published from 1987 to 2003, with one more planned. They explore the experiences of a young man, Alvin Miller, who realizes he has incredible powers for creating and shaping things around him.

==Overview==
The stories take place on the American frontier in the early 19th century, a fantasy setting based on early American folklore and superstition in a world in which folk magic actually works and manifests differently by race. Many Caucasian characters have a limited supernatural ability, or “knack,” to do some task nearly perfectly, Native Americans manifest nature magic, and people of African ancestry can work voodoo.

The stories involve a number of historical events and figures but are as a creation of alternate history. The primary divergence is the survival of Oliver Cromwell from the illness that killed him in reality since a physician secretly has a magical healing knack (Cromwell considered such knacks evil witchcraft). The Colonial United States is divided in the books into a number of separate nations, including a smaller United States, whose capital is Philadelphia and largest city is a Dutch-settled but increasingly-English-speaking New Amsterdam. The series displays much stronger Native American influence in its culture and society between New England and Virginia that extends westwards to Ohio. (New England is a colony of a Republican England in which the English Restoration never occurred thanks to Cromwell’s survival.) A monarchy on the southern portion of the Eastern Seaboard (the real-world Carolinas, Georgia, etc.), known as the &quot;Crown Colonies,&quot; was founded by the House of Stuart in exile. An autonomous region, known as &quot;Apalachee,&quot; is centered on the Appalachian Mountains. Canada remains controlled by France, and Florida and Nueva Barcelona (the real-world Louisiana) are colonized by Spain. The real-world Mexico is an indigenous empire but faces the prospect of war from the United States and from European powers. In addition, many historical figures are presented as caricatures or bear only superficial resemblance to their historical life.

Some historical figures are also accorded knacks, such as Benjamin Franklin (appearing only briefly but being repeatedly mentioned), who is said to have been a Maker, and Napoleon, who has the abilities to make others adore and obey him and to see others&#x27; great ambitions.

Famous Native American figures include Tecumseh, who is called &quot;Ta Kumsaw&quot; in the books, and his brother Tensquatawa is also featured, as &quot;Tenskwa Tawa.&quot; The characters in the book display features that are similar to those of both real-life famous Native Americans. The famous Battle of Tippecanoe in which both brothers were involved occurs in the second book, &quot;Red Prophet&quot;, but its outcome is different from the historic one.

==Characters==
===Alvin Miller===
Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son, discovers that his knack far surpasses that of everyone else. He can change both living and nonliving matter simply by force of will and so has the title &quot;Maker.&quot; This power comes at a cost, however, since Alvin feels a great responsibility to use his power for good, and there are also forces that actively seek his death.

Alvin must discover how to use his abilities, apply them for good, and struggle to survive. Along the way, he is helped by a number of people who have knacks that are not as strong, but they see in Alvin a way to use their wisdom and abilities to contribute to a greater good. Some people try to misguide him or exploit his abilities for their own purposes.

Alvin Miller is Card&#x27;s reimagining of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.

===Mentioned characters===
These are characters who are mentioned but do not appear.

* Oliver Cromwell: His survival from the illness that killed him in reality because his physician, unknown to Cromwell, had a magical “knack” for healing and so the monarchy was not restored, which drastically altered the subsequent history of both Great Britain and British North America. That is the key divergence point of this alternative history.
* Benjamin Franklin: He is described as a &quot;wizard&quot; and also as a possible &quot;maker&quot; himself (he appears briefly in &quot;Seventh Son&quot; as &quot;Old Ben&quot;).
* George Washington: He is described as &quot;Lord Potomac,&quot; who served under the British crown but surrendered his army and was subsequently beheaded for treason in the series&#x27;s alternate version of the American Revolution.
* Thomas Jefferson: He serves as the first President of the United States in this timeline.
* John Quincy Adams: He serves as Governor of Massachusetts during the events of &quot;Heartfire&quot;.
===The Unmaker===
The Unmaker is a supernatural force that breaks apart matter and aims to destroy and consume everything and everyone. Essentially, the Unmaker is entropy as a conscious and destructive entity. Aside from opposing all life, the Unmaker is the particular nemesis of Alvin Miller, who is a Maker of exceptional power and prodigious creativity and enriches life by constructing both objects and social bridges. That threatens and thwarts the Unmaker, which repeatedly attempts to do away with Alvin, at first by inducing accidents at Alvin&#x27;s childhood, especially by drowning since eroding water has a natural affinity to it, and later by influencing people to challenge and repudiate him.

To make something is to oppose the Unmaker, but a point often made is that is futile. By natural law, the Unmaker can tear down faster than any man can build. On the other hand, making cares nothing about natural law. As Taleswapper reveals to a seven-year-old Alvin, the creation of what is known as the Crystal City could defeat and even destroy the Unmaker. That becomes Alvin&#x27;s mission in life.

The Unmaker is usually undetectable to most people, but Alvin can detect its attention as a shimmering around his field of vision. It manifests when it needs to tempt people into war and destruction and then takes the most effective shape. A priest would see an avenging angel, a slave-owner would see a great overseer, etc. It does not appear to those who destroy willingly since they serve its cause already.

==Themes==

===Mormonism===
Alvin has some characteristics similar to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Card is a member of this denomination, which is known informally as Mormons. Some of the events in &quot;Seventh Son&quot; are similar to stories about Smith&#x27;s childhood. Alvin has visions of creating a Crystal City, which is similar to the church settlement of Nauvoo, Illinois. Alvin has had premonitions that he may die after building the Crystal City, which suggests Smith&#x27;s death in Carthage, Illinois. Alvin was also the name of Smith&#x27;s eldest brother.

===Race===
Race also plays a large part in the stories, particularly in how culture shapes the abilities that people of different groups develop. &quot;Whites&quot; have knacks or cultivated skills that appear to be derived from the folklore and traditions of Colonial America and Western Europe. &quot;Reds&quot; align themselves with the rhythms of nature but also use blood to perform some of their magic. &quot;Blacks&quot; channel their skills into creating objects of power like in the practices of voodoo.

===Conflict===
A recurring theme of the books is the conflict between creators and destroyers. Alvin is a Maker and confronts the Unmaker.

<doc id="981455" wikidata="Q5237655" url="?curid=981455" title="David Monro (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir David Monro (27 March 1813 – 15 February 1877) was a New Zealand politician. He served as Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1861 to 1870.

==Early life==
Monro was born in Edinburgh. His father was Alexander Monro, a lecturer at the Edinburgh Medical College. Monro was from a long line of doctors, the Monro of Fyrish family that was a branch of clan Munro. He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine from his father&#x27;s college in 1835. After first studying for a time in Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Monro established a medical practice in Edinburgh. In 1841, however, Monro bought land in the planned settlement at Nelson, New Zealand. He arrived in Nelson the following year.

Monro married Dinah Secker on 7 May 1845 and they had five sons and two daughters, including Charles Monro, who introduced rugby union to New Zealand, and Maria Georgiana Monro, who married the Scottish geologist, naturalist, and surgeon James Hector.

==Political career==
In 1843, following the Wairau Affray, Monro was chosen (along with Alfred Domett, later to become Premier) to present the Nelson settlers&#x27; views to Willoughby Shortland, the acting Governor. Partly as a result of this attention, Monro was appointed to the Legislative Council of the New Munster Province in 1849, but resigned after a dispute with Governor George Grey.




In 1853, Monro was elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament, representing the seat of Waimea. He was re-elected in the same seat for the 2nd Parliament in 1858. At the beginning of the 3rd Parliament, to which Monro had been elected as representative of Picton, he was selected as Speaker. He is generally regarded as having conducted this duty &quot;with dignity&quot;, although his use of the Speaker&#x27;s casting vote to unseat Premier William Fox in 1862 was controversial. At the 1866 general election, he successfully contested the Cheviot electorate and declared elected unopposed. Monro remained Speaker until 1870, when he announced that he would step down. William Fox, who was once again Premier, failed to move the traditional vote of thanks.

Monro contested the Motueka seat in the 1871 elections, and was declared elected. A subsequent petition, however, overturned this result. The committee that made the ruling had a government majority, and some of its findings have been deemed &quot;legally dubious&quot; – many believe that the decision was taken for political reasons. Furthermore, a proposal to appoint Monro to the Legislative Council was blocked by Fox. Monro nevertheless succeeded in re-entering Parliament through a 1872 by-election in Waikouaiti. After the Fox government had been defeated, Monro resigned in 1873.

==Life outside politics==

For some time, Monro leased Warwick House, at the time known as &quot;Sunnyside&quot;. The house was built for Arthur Fell (father of Charles Fell) in 1854 by builder David Goodall. When Fell returned to England, Monro leased the house. Later, the house was bought by Nathaniel Edwards. The building at 64 Brougham Street in Nelson is one of the finest and largest examples of early Victorian Gothic Revivalism still remaining in New Zealand. At one time, the house had about 50 rooms. The building was registered on 25 November 1982 as Category II with Heritage New Zealand, with registration number 1618.

Monro was knighted in 1866. He died at his home, Newstead (now known as Renwick House), in Nelson, New Zealand, on 15 February 1877.

The perennial herb endemic to New Zealand &quot;Myosotis monroi&quot; and the species of speargrass &quot;Aciphylla monroi&quot; are named after him.

<doc id="981459" wikidata="Q1430995" url="?curid=981459" title="Kumdo">
<text>Kumdo () is a modern Korean martial art. It is derived from kendo, the Japanese martial art. Its name is also spelled Kǒmdo, Keomdo, Gumdo and Geomdo.

Kumdo, commonly translated as &quot;the way of the sword&quot;, encompasses a variety of sword-based martial arts rooted in both Korean and Japanese traditions. Among these, Haidong Gumdo, a popular style in Korea, emphasizes broad, flowing sword movements designed to replicate ancient battlefield techniques. This contrasts with kendo&#x27;s focus on precision and controlled strikes. According to Boye Lafayette De Mente in &quot;Korean Mind&quot;, kumdo&#x27;s philosophy reflects Confucian principles of discipline and respect, embodying cultural values shared by both Korea and Japan.

Since its introduction from Japan, kumdo has been widely integrated into Korean culture and society. Over time, the term &quot;kumdo&quot; has evolved into a more general label for Korean martial arts rooted in swordsmanship. It can refer to the competitive, sporting form akin to Japanese kendo or other martial forms such as Haidong Gumdo and Hankumdo.

Although related to Japanese kendo, Korean kumdo has distinct features shaped by cultural appropriation and acculturation. Key differences include the use of native Korean terminology, blue flags for referees instead of red, and slight modifications to the uniform. These distinctions highlight how kumdo has adapted and developed in Korea.

==History==

The introduction of bamboo practice swords and armor to sword training is attributed to Naganuma Shirōzaemon Kunisato, of the Jikishinkage-ryū during the Shotoku Era.

In April 1895, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) was established in Kyoto, Japan for the preservation of older Martial activities such as sword, archery and unarmed combat. Swordsmen in Japan had established schools of kenjutsu (lit: &quot;sword techniques&quot;) over centuries of military heritage and this material formed the basis for the DNBK swordwork.

In 1896, the DNBK expanded to Korea as the Dai Nippon Butokukai - Choson-bu (Korean Branch) under Nakamura, Tokichi. Japanese Swordsmanship Kenjutsu, like Judo, was adapted to the Japanese educational system in 1911 at the prodding of Naito Takaharu and Isogai Hajime, both of the DNBK, since the use of a pliant bamboo sword and padded armour allowed competitors to strike each other with sword techniques in greater safety. The DNBK changed the name of this sporting form of swordsmanship, first called gekiken, (Kyūjitai: 擊劍; Shinjitai: 撃剣, &quot;hitting sword&quot;) to kendo in 1920. Korea, then subject to Japanese policy and administration, also adopted these practices but often using Korean rather than Japanese terminology. Made a required course in Korean schools in 1939, kendo continued to be taught until 1945. After WWII, kumdo and kendo diverged to form separate but nearly identical practices.

The following is a brief historical time-line of kumdo development.

* 1895 In April 1895 the Dai Nippon Butokukai, or &quot;All Japan Martial Virtue Society&quot; had been established in Kyoto by civilian enthusiasts of various traditional Japanese arts such as Archery, Ju-jutsu and Ken-jutsu.
* 1895 As many as 40 Japanese advisors are brought into Korea, several of which are placed with the national police administration. As part of the restructuring of the national Korean police indicated in the Kabo Reforms of 1894, cadets at the &quot;Kyongmuchong&quot; or Police Academy are required to learn &quot;kyok gom&quot; (J. &quot;gekki ken&quot;) or &quot;combat swordsmanship&quot; as one of its training subjects.
* 1896 The Dai Nippon Butokukai (DNBK), Chosen-bu (Korean Branch) under Nakamura, Tokichi, is established.
* 1904 Training in Japanese military sword (K. &quot;kyok gom&quot;) is included in the curriculum of the Yonsong Army Academy.
* 1906 &quot;Gekiken&quot; introduced into Korean school curriculum
* 1908 a tournament held between the Korean police and their Japanese counterparts. Gekiken was also included in the first official national physical education program for the general public.
* 1910 Japanese annexation/occupation of Korea.
* 1919 According to Japanese records, the term kendo is coined in Japan on August 1, 1919.
* 1927 Kumdo becomes an official curricular subject in junior high schools.
* 1935 Kumdo included in the 16th National Joseon Sports Festival
* 1945 Korean liberation from Japanese occupation.
* 1947 Korean kumdo begins restructuring and distancing from Japanese disciplines with the holding of the Seoul Police Kumdo Tournament

* 1950 The 1st National Police Kumdo Tournament was held
* 1952 A committee was created to oversee the formation of the KKA
* 1953 The KKA was inaugurated and became affiliated with the Korean Amateur Sports Association
* The 1st National Individual Kumdo Championships were held (Same year that the All Japan Kendo Federation was formed)
* 1956 Kumdo was once more included as an official event of the National Sports Festival after a break of 20 years
* 1959 Kumdo became increasingly popular with the President&#x27;s Cup Grade Category Tournament, and the National Student Championships
* 1964 The Student Kumdo Federation became affiliated with the KKA
* 1970 The Student Federation separated into the Collegiate Federation and the Secondary Schools Federation. The International Kendo Federation was formed and a Korean named as Vice President
* 1972 Kumdo was included in the National Youth Sports Meet
* 1979 The news agency Dong Ilbo joined forces with the KKA in sponsoring the President&#x27;s Cup National Championships
* 1988 The Korean Social Kumdo Federation was formed and followed by the 1st National Social Championships
* 1993 Inauguration of the SBS Royal National Championships

== Today ==
=== Philosophy ===
As with martial arts practices around the world, Korean kumdo is imbued with cultural and philosophical thoughts of both current society and the historic past. In this way, the sports aspects of kumdo practice seek to build strong character in its practitioners, while good character in turn contributes to an ardent competitive spirit while respecting tenets of courtesy, respect, sportsmanship and fair play. Though kumdo is modern, kumdo schools still invoke the &quot;O-Gae&quot; or &quot;Five tenets&quot; associated with the Silla kingdom of the Three Kingdoms period. The modern rendition of this code is as follows.

::Be loyal and faithful to your country and organization.
::Be faithful and respectful to your parents and elders.
::Be faithful and respectful to your friends and colleagues.
::Be confident and show courage when faced with injustice.
::Be benevolent.&quot;

In the modern era, additional tenets have been added, often reflecting challenges common to competition. Known as &quot;the Four Poisons&quot; these are Surprise, Fear, Doubt (or Hesitation) and Confusion. Regular and ardent practice is encouraged to steadily bring these natural responses under control. Similarly, kumdo practitioners seek to develop a state termed &quot;emptiness (K. Pyoungsangsim) wherein the natural execution of the method is not impacted by circumstances or environment. Another condition, known as &quot;Kiwi&quot; --- the state of mental, physical and spiritual discipline--- seeks clarity and objectivity regarding the matter at hand. And Jan Sim (lit. &quot;remaining mind&quot;) concerns steadfastness and perseverance.

===Equipment===

Protective equipment used in kumdo is called hogu()---bōgu in Japanese--- and consists of 6 elements.

NOT SHOWN.) Myŏn-soo-goon (, &quot;tenugui&quot; in Japanese): cotton scarf worn under the helmet to absorb perspiration and prevent interference in the competitors&#x27; vision. It can also be called a &quot;Dougong&quot; but not to be mixed up with the Chinese definition.

A.) Homyeoun (, &quot;men&quot; in Japanese): Helmet including a wire grill to protect the face.

B.) Kap (, &quot;dō&quot; in Japanese): Chest protector

D.) Kapsang (, &quot;tare&quot; in Japanese): Canvas and leather skirt worn around the waist to protect the hip and groin area

C,E.) Howan (, &quot;kote&quot; in Japanese):(pair) formed mitts with cuffs used to protect the hand and wrist area.

As with any modern contact sport, the use of a mouthguard (K.&#x27;eep bohodae&#x27;) is strongly encouraged.

In addition the individual will use a bamboo sword or Juk-To with which to strike or thrust at his opponent while fending off attacks.

1.) Pommel: Though identified as a part of the sword it is not accepted as a point of contact in regulation play.

2.) Ko-dûng-i: (, &quot;tsuba&quot; in Japanese) w/ rubber retaining washer: the hilt or guard of the sword is intended to offer some protection to the hands, but is more commonly used as a point of contact in close-quarters contest.

3.) Kalnal: () --- blade of the sword is only suggested as that side of the Juk-To opposite the Duengjul (lit. &quot;back cord&quot;)and the two-thirds portion of the Juk-To forward of the guard.

4.) Duengjul: A yellow string that stretches form the guard to the tip of the sword and signifies the spine of the sword.

5.) Joonghyuk: is the leather band marking the proximal limit of the recognized striking area of the sword.

6.) Sunnhyuk: is the leather cap representing the tip of the sword. Use of thrusts in competition is infrequent but are recognized when contact is made solely with this part of the sword.

A.) Byounghyuk: Represents the handle of the sword

B.)

C.) Ta-dol-bu: The area between the sunnhyuk and the joonghyuk representing the first third of the sword blade. In competition, a strike is counted only when the point of contact is solely with this area of the sword.

A standard juk-do meant for adults measures 120 cm (47 Inches), with those meant for males weighing a minimum of 510 grams and those meant for females weighing at least 420 grams. Traditionally made of 4 bamboo strips and bound with leather, advances in technology have produced juk-do made of high-impact plastics and carbon fibres; however, only juk-do made of bamboo are allowed in competition. Proportionately smaller items are available for child competitors.

Lastly, a kumdo practitioner will use a mok keom (lit. wooden sword). Though used historically for competition, the potential for injury including the likelihood of death has caused this item to be relegated to highly structured individual and paired form-work as a substitute for using steel swords.

===Clothing===
Kumdo practitioners wear a tobok (; lit: &quot;clothing for the way&quot;) or uniform which closely resembles that worn by kendo practitioners, usually indigo-blue in color. Many kumdo practitioners wear Paji ( 바지; lit. training pants ) with billowy pants legs after the fashion of Japanese hakama without &quot;koshiita&quot; though the ankles are not secured after the fashion of the Korean Hanbok or traditional dress. A heavy cotton double-weave jacket (K.Otdori; ) is worn and traditionally closed with a tie (K. Maettiôp); () though linen ties, after the fashion of Japanese traditions, are giving way to velcro fastenings. A belt (K.Dhee; ), usually signifying the individual&#x27;s rank or standing completes the uniform. In national tournaments, the Korean national team typically wears white Keikogi with black trim and stripes on their hakama, in contrast to the all-indigo-blue worn by kendo practitioners.

By comparison, required dress at training in the classroom may be less formal and idiosyncratic to the values of a given school or teacher. In this way, the more common Martial Arts uniform of, white and/or black pants and jacket, bound with a belt is common. Most recently there has been a growing trend towards recognizing the Korean nature of this art by binding the uniform pants legs at the ankle after the fashion of the Korean Hanbok. Though formerly accomplished with laces, velcro fastening is now used.

===Levels/Ranks===
Kumdo practitioners begin at the lowest level – 10th geup – and advance in knowledge and skill to 1st geup. The requirements for advancement may differ depending on the school or organizational affiliation, but generally, the goal of these levels is to imbue the practitioner with the fundamentals of conditioning, body motion, strategy and competition. After the geup levels, practitioners may continue to progress through a series of advanced ranks termed &quot;master&quot; or dan beginning with 1st dan level. As with geup levels, students may progress to higher dan levels by passing required examinations and demonstrating their prowess in competition, both of which are closely observed and assessed by cadre of the school and its organization.

=== Training ===
Training varies by school and organization, but some universal practices include: Neo-Confucian Sensitivity: Interactions emphasize respect and hierarchy and Bowing Rituals: Observed between students and teachers when entering and leaving the school or workout area, performed before and after competitions, drills, or instructions, and practiced at the beginning and end of each class.

A typical class of about an hour to an hour and a half can be divided into quarters. The first quarter is a warm-up period which focuses on a brief period of stretching and some aerobic activities. The second quarter involves the use of a bamboo sword (K. Juk-To) for drills and striking targets. The third quarter involves donning protective armor and participating in sparring. Alternately, the third portion of the class may be used to practice standardized individual (K. Hyung) or paired (K. Bon) form work. Though not standard, almost all classes conclude with a cool-down activity. Forms practiced by kumdo practitioners include the Bonguk Geombeop (, ), Joseon Saebeop (, ) and the ten &quot;bon&quot; or &quot;kendo no kata&quot; (, ), forms standardized by the FIK. The first two forms, the Bonguk Geombeop and Joeson Saebop are unique in that they are practiced by Korean kendoists and are not practiced by Japanese practitioners. Proficiency with these forms is required for rank promotion tests conducted by the Korea Kumdo Association (KKA), the de facto governing body for Korean kumdo, and its overseas affiliates. The &quot;bon&quot; practiced in kumdo may be of two types: a standard set of 10 Kata originating from kendo and/or a set of 15 engagements originating in . Commonly, either set is performed without &quot;sonkyo&quot; bow, a unique Japanese gesture, and using Korean names and terminology in place of the original Japanese. Joseon Saebeop and Bonguk Geombeop serve as kumdo&#x27;s practical historical link to Korean swordsmanship from previous eras, while &quot;bon&quot; and overall training and sparring style reflect Japanese influences on modern kumdo. Recently, A few kumdo dojang or schools also incorporate &quot;kuhapdo&quot; forms, the Korean variant for Japanese Iaido – an art focused on simultaneously drawing and cutting – in their curriculum.

==== Class Structure ====
A typical class lasts 1 to 1.5 hours and is divided into quarters:

Warm-Up Period: Includes stretching and aerobic activities.

Drills with Bamboo Sword (Juk-To): Focuses on striking targets and honing fundamental techniques.

Protective Armor and Sparring or Form Practice: Sparring with protective gear, and alternatively, practicing standardized individual forms (Hyung) or paired forms (Bon).

Cool-Down Activity (optional): Concludes the session with relaxation exercises.

==== Mental Discipline and Self-Control ====
Meditative Practices:Inspired by Korean Buddhist traditions, meditation helps develop focus, emotional regulation, and self-awareness.

Structured Learning:The progression of forms and techniques builds perseverance and goal-oriented behavior, fostering mental resilience.

Kumdo offers several physical benefits, including improved cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and flexibility. Practitioners engage in drills to build stamina, strengthen the core, and improve reflexes. Haidong Gumdo&#x27;s broader, flowing movements also contribute to enhanced joint mobility and muscular endurance.

Mental discipline is another core benefit. Practitioners develop resilience and patience by memorizing complex forms and adhering to rigorous training schedules. Kumdo&#x27;s connection to Confucian principles emphasizes respect and humility, cultivating a disciplined mindset that extends beyond the martial arts studio

Kumdo is more than a physical practice; it reflects Korea&#x27;s historical relationship with Japanese martial traditions and the unique development of Korean martial arts identity. Korean culture has shaped Kumdo and Haidong Gumdo into arts that blend Confucian values with warrior ethos. De Mente highlights that these practices are seen as ways to cultivate virtue and personal honor, essential traits in both Korean and Japanese warrior culture.

===Competition===
Korea sends a team to the World Kendo Championships or WKC held every three years and have been strong competitors in the past WKCs. During the 13th World Kendo Championships held in Taipei, Taiwan from December 8– 10, 2006, Korea defeated the United States to win the men&#x27;s team championship for the first time, the first country other than Japan to win a title at the WKCs. The United States had earlier eliminated the Japanese team during the semi-finals. In competition, the main differences between kendo and kumdo are stylistic. Kumdo practitioners generally favor a dynamic style of play, focusing on using fast, aggressive, and effective small motion strikes to create openings for attacks more in line with battlefield use. Kendo practitioners however, general focus on the perfect single strike, waiting patiently for an opening and the correct timing to land a decisive attack. In recent years, with frequent contact between kendo and kumdo stylists through cross-training and competition, this distinction has somewhat blurred, as individual practitioners of either kendo and kumdo have preferred styles of play.

Engagements are conducted between two individuals at a time, each wearing body armor and using bamboo swords. The court is typically a square or rectangle 9 to 11 meters on a side – surrounded by an additional margin of 1.5 meters – and is presided over by a referee and two corner referees. During the engagement—a five-minute period with the possibility of a three-minute extension—competitors may accrue points by striking their opponent with a prescribed attack or thrust. Though infrequently studied in the classroom and sometimes seen in local competitions, the use of disarms followed by a throw or joint-lock is not allowed in international competition. Judgments regarding the nature or quality of an attack, as well as general comportment of the competitors, are signaled by the referees and require a majority agreement to make a determination. With minor stylistic differences (kumdo judges use blue and white flags instead of the red and white flags found in kendo) these rules are followed by both Kumdo and kendo organizations in both national and international play.

===Organizations===
*Korea Kumdo Association (KKA) – the organization for kumdo in Korea due to its size and its influence through their heavy promotion of the art in the media. The art promoted by them, &quot;Daehan Kumdo&quot; (大韓劍道), is virtually identical to kendo as practiced in Japan, with noted changes to reflect Korean cultural influences and methodology, and is the kumdo which Koreans normally refer to. The KKA has established overseas branches in other countries which have substantial Korean populations and have kumdo dojangs or schools. Unlike most of the FIK affiliates, including Japan, they wish to see kumdo/kendo become an Olympic sport as with Judo and Taekwondo.
*The Dae Han Kum Sa Association (대한검사회), predecessor to the Dae Han Kumdohoe (The Korea Kumdo Association, 대한검도회) was organized on May 20, 1948. At that time, some 100 masters, including Suh Chong Hac, Kim Yong Dal, Ho Ik Yong, Chung Tae Min, Lee Chung Ku, Do Ho Mun, Kang Nak-won, Pak Chong-kyu and Kim Yong-bae met on the grounds of the Changdok Palace and formed the Taehan Kumsa Association. In 1953, the Korean Kumdo Association was founded by Chong Hac Suh in cooperation with kendo practitioners both in Korea and Japan. Later, Suh would relocate to Bettendorf, Iowa in the United States and establish the World Kumdo Association.
*The World Kumdo Association (WKA) – Founded around 2001 as a merger of thirteen smaller, rival kumdo organizations, they are critical of the KKA and seek to become a rival to the FIK by having kumdo included in the Olympic games with them as the recognized governing body ahead of the FIK. Equipment, Forms, regulations and scoring are essentially the same, though Korean practice tends to be somewhat more heavy-handed, while Japanese practice tends to be somewhat lighter. As a result, the WKA are proponents of changes to the format and scoring system, advocating the use of electric scoring as with fencing.

There are also a number of kumdo dojang, or &quot;training halls&quot; outside Korea, primarily where there are large Korean ethnic populations such as North America and Europe. Many of these dojangs choose to be affiliated with overseas branches of kumdo organizations like the KKA rather than the local FIK affiliate for that country. For example, many of the kumdo dojangs in the United States choose to affiliate with an overseas branch of the KKA instead of seeking association with the All United States Kendo Federation (AUSKF), the FIK affiliate for the US. However, because the KKA is a FIK affiliate, rankings awarded by them, are honored and accepted by the other affiliates including the AUSKF. While kumdo practitioners outside Korea also compete in kendo tournaments, many choose to compete only at tournaments sponsored by a kumdo organization. One example is the annual Bong-Rim-Gi Kumdo tournament held each summer among kumdo schools in the United States and sponsored by an overseas branch of the KKA.

=== Differences and Similarities with Other Martial Arts ===
Kumdo, Haidong Gumdo, Kendo, and Taekwondo share similarities in emphasizing mental discipline, respect, and tradition. Kumdo and Kendo, though related, differ in techniques and objectives. Kendo, as practiced in Japan, is more uniform and sport-oriented, focusing on scoring points with quick strikes to defined targets, whereas Kumdo is broader, incorporating various styles and techniques. Haidong Gumdo includes dynamic and aesthetic sword patterns (forms), which echo the fluidity of ancient battlefield maneuvers.

In comparison, Taekwondo, a Korean martial art focused on striking techniques, emphasizes kicks and hand techniques, distinct from the weapon-based approach of Kumdo and Kendo. Nevertheless, both share similar values of perseverance and respect for tradition, important in Confucian thought. Training in Haidong Gumdo and Taekwondo involves a high degree of physical conditioning and mental discipline, creating strong parallels despite technical differences

===Terminology===
Kumdo uses Korean terminology though much of it is come from the same Chinese characters as the Japanese words in kendo. For example, the criteria used to determine whether a point is valid is known as instead of . Both words derive from the same Chinese roots; 氣 for spirit, 劍 for sword, and 體 for body. Note the slight differences in the appearance of some characters due to the Japanese use of shinjitai characters.

<text>The Western corn rootworm, &quot;Diabrotica virgifera virgifera&quot;, is one of the most devastating corn rootworm species in North America, especially in the midwestern corn-growing areas such as Iowa. A related species, the Northern corn rootworm, &quot;D. barberi&quot;, co-inhabits in much of the range and is fairly similar in biology.

Two other subspecies of &quot;D. virgifera&quot; are described, including the Mexican corn rootworm (&quot;Diabrotica virgifera zeae&quot;), a significant pest in its own right, attacking corn in that country.

Corn rootworm larvae can destroy significant percentages of corn if left untreated. In the United States, current estimates show that of corn (out of 80 million grown) are infested with corn rootworm. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that corn rootworms cause $1 billion in lost revenue each year, including $800 million in yield loss and $200 million in cost of treatment for corn growers.

== Life cycle ==

There are many similarities in the life cycles of the northern and western corn rootworm. Both overwinter in the egg stage in the soil. Eggs, which are deposited in the soil during the summer, are American football-shaped, white, and less than long. Larvae hatch in late May or early June and begin to feed on corn roots. Newly hatched larvae are small, less than long, white worms. Corn rootworms go through three larval instars, pupate in the soil and emerge as adults in July and August. One generation emerges each year. Larvae have brown heads and a brown marking on the top of the last abdominal segment, giving them a double-headed appearance. Larvae have three pairs of legs, but these are not usually visible without magnification. After feeding for several weeks, the larvae dig a cell in the soil and molt into the pupal stage. The pupal stage is white and has the basic shape of the adult. Adult rootworms are about long. Western corn rootworms are yellowish with a black stripe on each wing cover. Northern corn rootworm beetles are solid in color and vary from light tan to pale green.

Timing of egg hatch varies from year to year due to temperature differences and location. Males begin to emerge before females. Emergence often continues for a month or more. In years with hot, dry summers, numbers of western corn rootworm beetles may decline rapidly after mid-August, although in summers with less extreme conditions they may be found up until the first frost.

Females mate soon after emergence. Western corn rootworm females need to feed for about two weeks before they can lay eggs. Temperature and food quality influence the pre-oviposition period. Females typically lay eggs in the top of soil, although they may be laid more than deep, particularly if the soil surface is dry. Western corn rootworm females are more likely to lay some of their eggs below the depth than northern corn rootworm females.

== Feeding habits ==

Rootworm larvae can complete development only on corn and a few other species of grasses. Rootworm larvae reared on other grasses (specifically, yellow foxtail) emerged as adults later and had smaller head capsule size as adults compared to larvae reared on corn. Adults feed primarily on corn silk, pollen and kernels on exposed ear tips, although they will feed on leaves and pollen of other plants. Adults begin emerging before corn reproductive tissues are present, adults may feed on leaf tissue, scraping away the green surface tissue and leaving a window-pane appearance. However, adults quickly shift to preferred green silks and pollen as they become available. Northern corn rootworm adults feed on reproductive tissues of the corn plant, but rarely feed on corn leaves. &quot;Northern&quot; adults are more likely than &quot;western&quot; adults to abandon corn and seek pollen or flowers of other plants as corn matures.

== Feeding damage ==

Most of the damage to corn is caused by larval feeding. Hatchlings locate roots and begin feeding on the fine root hairs, burrowing into root tips. As larvae grow, they feed on and tunnel into primary roots. When rootworms are abundant, larval feeding and deterioration of injured roots by root rot pathogens can result in roots being pruned to the stalk base. Severe root injury interferes with the roots&#x27; ability to transport water and nutrients, reduces growth and results in reduced grain production. Severe root injury may result in lodging of corn plants, making harvest more difficult. Silk feeding by adults can result in pruning at the ear tip, commonly called silk clipping. In field corn, beetle populations are occasionally high enough to cause severe silk clipping during pollen shed, which may interfere with pollination.

== History of invasions ==

The Western corn rootworm rapidly expanded its range in North America during the second part of the 20th century. It is now present from the southwestern region of the US Corn Belt to the east coast. It was introduced at the end of the 20th century into Europe, where it was first observed near Belgrade, Serbia in 1992. The Serbian outbreak spread north and south to include Greece to Poland and east from Italy to Ukraine. In addition to this large continuous area in Central and southeastern Europe, discontinuous outbreaks have been detected in Europe. The first was discovered near Venice, Italy, in 1998, in northwestern Italy (Piedmont) and Switzerland (canton Ticino) in 2000, northeastern Italy in 2002 (near Pordenone) and 2003 (near Udine), northern Italy (Trentino), Eastern France (Alsace), Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2003 and the Parisian region, France in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Outbreaks detected in north Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Parisian region did not persist.
The distribution of the European corn rootworm resulted from several introductions from North America. At least three successive introductions gave rise to outbreaks detected in Serbia in 1992, the Italian Piedmont in 2000, and Ile-de-France in 2002. The European outbreaks observed in Alsace in 2003 and Ile-de-France in 2005 came from two additional introductions from North America, bringing to five the number of transatlantic introductions. The exact North American origin of the European introductions has not yet been found, but the north of the US appears to be the most likely.
Small remote outbreaks in southern Germany and north-eastern Italy most likely originated from long-distance dispersal events from Central and southeastern Europe. The large European outbreak is thus likely expanding by stratified dispersal, involving both continuous diffusion and discontinuous long-distance dispersal. This latter mode of dispersal may accelerate expansion in Europe.

== Management ==
Multiple management practices aim to control corn rootworms. These practices include corn variety selection, early planting, insecticides, crop rotation and transgenic corn varieties.

=== Variety ===
No commercial, non-transgenic resistant corn varieties are available. Several hybrid corn traits reduce damage by increasing stalk strength and root mass size. These characteristics allow a plant to better tolerate rootworm feeding, with reduced likelihood of lodging.

=== Early planting ===
Early planted fields that have completed pollen shed are less attractive and therefore have less egg laying activity. Early fields have relatively larger root systems when rootworm feeding starts. This makes them somewhat more tolerant. Practices that promote strong root systems and a generally vigorous crop make corn more tolerant to rootworm feeding and damage.

=== Insecticides ===
Soil-applied insecticides effectively control corn rootworms. Insecticide may be warranted in areas that have a history of moderate to high damage. The number of adults present during the previous growing season is the best guide for selecting fields to be treated. However, in some areas of high insecticide use in central Nebraska, populations of corn rootworm beetles have become resistant to certain insecticides. Aldrin resistance was probably introduced independently, at least twice, from North America into Europe. Organophosphates, such as methyl-parathion, may provide effective control of both larval and adult populations in Central and southeastern Europe and in northwest Italy.

=== Crop rotation ===
Crop rotation is a consistent and economical means of controlling rootworms the season following an outbreak in corn-growing areas where rootworm beetles primarily lay eggs in corn. As a way to reduce rootworm densities, it is more effective than insecticides. Corn rootworm larvae must feed on corn roots to develop and mature properly. If they hatch in a field without corn, they starve because they cannot move more than 10 to in search of food. However, two rootworm biotypes survive rotation. The &quot;soybean&quot; variant was first discovered in central Illinois in the late 1980s and spread throughout Illinois, Indiana, southern Wisconsin and eastern Iowa. Instead of laying eggs into a corn field, the females of the soybean variant mate and then fly into a soybean field to lay their eggs, allowing the larvae to hatch in a field likely to rotate back to corn the following year. In the 1980s northern corn rootworm began to be a problem by beating the corn rotation practice with extended diapause eggs. The eggs remained in the soil for two years or more before hatching, thereby avoiding the soybean year. As of 2017, this adaptation has been observed in areas of Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota, Wisconsin and Nebraska.

Companion or second crop planting can dramatically increase rootworm populations. Corn with pumpkins or corn following pumpkins are examples of planting patterns that exacerbate rootworm feeding pressure.

Shrestha, Dunbar, French and Gassmann have reported that field history causes variation in the degree of corn rootworm resistance. All the fields they found had corn rootworms resistant to the traits, but they observed that significantly more corn rootworm larvae survived in fields with Bt resistance. They recommend faithful crop rotation not only for reducing the population of the worm, but to slow the adaptation of the worm as well.

=== Natural enemies ===
Among natural enemies - Argiope bruennichi, Theridion impressum, Coccinella sp., Pseudophomus rufipes.

=== Transgenics ===
Planting rootworm-resistant transgenic corn is another strategy for minimizing damage. Bt corn is effective at reducing root damage and is safer and often cheaper than insecticide. The transgenic traits, isolated from the common soil bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; strain (often referred to as Bt), produce the insect control protein.

Bt was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese biologist S. Ishiwatari as the source of disease that was killing large populations of silkworms. Bt was first used as an insecticide in 1920 and spray formulations containing either Bt bacteria or Bt proteins came into use in the 1970s for crop protection, including organic farming operations. Bt insecticides saw expanded use and development in the 1980s as an alternative to synthetic insecticides. Beginning in the 1980s, the genes responsible for making &quot;Bt&quot; proteins were isolated and transferred into corn plants. Bt was commercially approved in transgenic corn seed in the mid-1990s. Compared to spray formulations, transgenic plants with the Bt protein provide much more effective insect protection throughout the season. Other Bt proteins have been used to genetically modify potatoes, cotton and other types of commercial corn. The two most common brands of transgenic Bt corn are Genuity and Herculex. Genuity Smartstax combines Monsanto&#x27;s VT Triple Pro, Roundup Ready 2, and Acceleron Seed Treatment System technologies, as well as Dow Chemical&#x27;s Herculex Xtra and Liberty Link technologies. Acceleron, Herculex Xtra, and VT Triple Pro include traits for protection from insect damage.

Bt must be ingested to kill the insect. A susceptible larva eats the protein, which then binds to receptors in the larval gut. Binding initiates a cascade of effects that ultimately leads to death. Bt proteins are highly selective on certain categories and species of insects, eliminating insecticide use and its harmful effects to non-target organisms.

Recently, however, strains of rootworms that exhibit Bt resistance have been discovered in several Midwestern US states.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI10.1371/journal.pone.0022629&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Monsanto, the &quot;YieldGard VT Triple and Genuity VT Triple PRO corn products&quot; are affected. In 2009, four strains in Iowa were found to have field-evolved resistance to Bt corn. Some rootworms were found to be resistant to two or more Bt toxins in addition to being tolerant to crop rotation. This ability to rapidly evolve to adapt to multiple traits in their new food source has proved to be a challenge for farmers and scientists. That same year, Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta and Dow Agro-Sciences all began to sell &quot;stacked&quot; or pyramid corn seed designed to slow the development of resistance. These products combined traits to increase effectiveness, however, so many of these traits are failing that soon they will run out of ingredients to stack. A new bacterial gene has been discovered by researchers that will kill rootworms, but it is not expected to be available to farmers before 2029.

By 2014 Syngenta Agrisure RW-rootworm strains had been detected in Iowa as well as glyphosate. Agrisure RW-based products entered the market in 2007. However, government officials, academics and companies lack consensus on how to define the resistance phenomenon. The affected fields constituted 0.2% of transgenic US corn acres. Further the affected areas had not been rotated with other crops.

As of December 2018, the corn rootworm has been found to be resistant to all four traits.

=== Biological solutions ===
In Austria, an innovative protection method has been developed, using the &quot;mating disruption&quot; method for the first time in corn fields. The according product is called CornProtect. The female bugs distribute pheromones that attract males. With that new method, such pheromones are put on specially treated mineral carriers and are slowly released over the full flying period of the bugs. Mating is significantly reduced, because males become disoriented and less interested in copulating. Reproduction is drastically reduced The application is done with conventional field sprayers which makes it economically very viable.

<text>Ciudad Perdida (Spanish for &quot;lost city&quot;; also known as Teyuna and Buritaca-200) is the archaeological site of an ancient city in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta of Colombia, within the jurisdiction of the municipality of Santa Marta. This city is believed to have been founded about 800 AD. If so, Ciudad Perdida predates Machu Picchu by about 650 years. 

Ciudad Perdida consists of a series of 169 terraces carved into the mountainside, a network of tiled roads, and several small circular plazas. The entrance can be accessed only by climbing up 1,200 stone steps through dense jungle.

==Modern discovery==
Ciudad Perdida was discovered in 1972 by Los Sepúlvedas, a group of local treasure looters.

Los Sepúlvedas were a small family of looters living in Colombia. The family often went hunting in the forests, and one day they shot a wild turkey. While retrieving the turkey, they noticed it had fallen on a series of stone steps rising up the mountainside. They climbed up the stone steps and discovered an abandoned city, which they named &quot;Green Hell&quot; or &quot;Wide Set&quot;. After the murder of one of the Sepúlveda sons at the site of Ciudad Perdida, fights broke out among the looters. 

Soon after, gold figures and ceramic urns from Ciudad Perdida began to appear on the local black market. This alerted archaeologists, and a team led by the director of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropología, reached the site in 1976. The site was reconstructed between 1976 and 1982.

Although La Ciudad Perdida is an impressive site, it is not the only one of its kind. Only about 30–40% of the sites in the Sierra Nevada region have been explored. However, thanks to recent widespread lidar access, more and more of these sites are being discovered.

Members of local tribes – notably the Kogi people – have stated that they visited the site of Ciudad Perdida regularly before it was widely reported, but had kept quiet about it. They call the city &quot;Teyuna&quot; and believe it was the heart of a network of villages inhabited by their forebears, the Tairona.

==History==

Built around , Ciudad Perdida was most likely the region&#x27;s political and manufacturing center on the Buritaca River and may have housed 2,000–8,000 people. The site was originally inhabited by the Tairona people. According to the Kogi people, who are some of the last preserved indigenous descendants of the Tairona, the Tairona lived for thousands of years, up until the age of the Spanish conquistadors.

The Tairona people were forced to flee from La Ciudad Perdida sometime in the 16th century, after years of trade and conflict.

=== Indigenous tribes ===

Indigenous peoples had established advanced communities 1,500 years before the Spanish arrived. These communities were connected by stone paths, which facilitated the exchange of food and products of gold, stone, and clay. The inhabitants took advantage of the rich variety of foods and resources available in this mountainous region near the sea. They had gardens to grow vegetables such as tomatoes and corn, and fruits such as avocado, guanabana, pineapple, and guava. Due to their close proximity to the ocean, they obtained a large variety of seafood. Indigenous children learned stories and legends from elders and learned to create fabrics to make clothes and mochilas. Children and adults admired the warriors who protected the indigenous people from the Spanish conquerors.

Although they are generally referred to as the &quot;Tairona people&quot;, there were many groups and settlements spread across the mountains and beaches in distinct, smaller communities (polities) all trading and working together. The Tairona people, much like the Kogi people today, were not violent people. The Kogi believe in kindness and equality. The Tairona people lived to protect and serve the earth, not only for themselves but for everyone.

As the European colonizers settled in indigenous territory, they began enslaving the natives who fished and collected salt on the coast. The Tairona people in the mountains, dependent on the fish and salt farmed by the coastal Tairona people, told escaped enslaved Tairona members to return and bring the Europeans gifts of gold to appease them. The Europeans took the gold but were not appeased and became more hostile to the natives. The Tairona eventually fled in the 1500s.

Around 1970, some farmers who colonized the lower part of the Sierra Nevada, up to approximately 700 meters above sea level, learned of the possibilities of finding great treasures. In a short time, some of them organized themselves and without any archaeological preparation, they dedicated themselves to the looting of the Tayrona tombs, an illegal activity called guaquería.

The guaqueros went deeper and deeper into the Sierra until, in 1973, one of them, Julio César Sepúlveda, arrived at the lost city and began to loot it. Almost simultaneously, another guaquero, Jorge Restrepo, along with his men arrived in Teyuna and dedicated himself to looting. The two sides clashed and the two leaders died in the bloody combat. History repeated itself. After almost 500 years since the first Europeans landed in America, the mania for getting rich with the gold buried in indigenous tombs continued to kill victims. 

The effects of the conquistador&#x27;s colonization of their villages are still seen today. As the years passed, the Europeans took more and more of the gold originally crafted by the indigenous people. Much of that gold still resides in museums across Europe, leaving the current descendant tribes of today—the Kogi, Arsarios, Arhuacos, Kankwamos, and Chimilas—without any of the gold of their ancestors.

The Kogi people live in the last pre-Columbian settlement and have more-or-less kept the ways of the Tairona people since they were forced out of their settlements by the conquistadors. Although the Kogi can provide insight into the Tairona, they are distinct from the people who lived 500 years ago. The Kogi believe that everything buried in La Ciudad Perdida contributes to the peace, harmony, and balance of the world. After teaching one of their members Spanish, they presented this case to the Colombian government and successfully reclaimed the rights to their ancestral land. Now, groups like the Global Heritage Fund continuously work to protect the historic site against, as the Kogi people would say, &quot;younger brother&#x27;s&quot; harm.

==Armed conflict==
The area around Ciudad Perdida was affected by the Colombian armed conflict between the Colombian National Army, right-wing paramilitary groups, and left-wing guerrilla groups like the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

During the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, due to the boom of drug traffic and contraband, FARC and ELN settled in the zone, creating routes and armies and using forced taxation with the communities as well. During this time, a peace treaty with the government was in the making for demobilization; however, this allowed for other guerilla groups that were not part of the treaty to get stronger and united; around the same time, right-wing paramilitary groups invaded the region El Mamey, in the north of Ciudad Perdida, creating instability, in the area and a wave of violence between all armed forces. By the late 1990s, most of the territory was under the Colombian paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC).

On 15 September 2003, the ELN kidnapped eight foreign tourists visiting Ciudad Perdida, demanding a government investigation into human rights abuses in exchange for their hostages. The ELN released the last of the hostages three months later. The AUC continued attacking aborigines and non-aborigines in the zone. In 2006, after a demobilization treaty, the damage done by the Colombian paramilitary group amounted to 8000 direct victims, around 274 violent deaths, and 1000 indirect victims.

==Resumed access==
In the search to create, develop, plan, project, research, and protect the area with conservation and preservation plans, settlement of inter-institutional cooperation no. 008 was established between national parks (PNN) and the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH); this Indigenous management plan model allows Colombian Sierra Nevada and the Indigenous populations to receive environmental, regional, and international benefits. PNN has developed ecotourism strategies to preserve natural resources in accordance with the &quot;parques con la gente&quot; (parks with the people) policy for active social interaction. Nowadays, this has allowed for the inclusion of larger committees such as the Department of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, PNN, and the Indigenous reservation Kogui-Malayo-Arhuaco, in which they study the tourist occupancy in Teyuna &quot;Ciudad Perdida,&quot; does not negatively impact any environmental and cultural aspect. Indigenous communities play an active role in decision-making about the territory due to the historical and ancestral value of preserving their past heritage.

In 2005, tourist hikes became operational again and there have been no problems since then. The Colombian Army actively patrols the area, which is now deemed to be safe for visitors, and there have not been any more kidnappings.

Since 2009, the non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working in Ciudad Perdida to preserve and protect the historic site against climate, vegetation, neglect, looting, and unsustainable tourism. GHF&#x27;s stated goals include the development and implementation of a regional management plan, documentation and conservation of the archaeological features at Ciudad Perdida, and engagement of the local indigenous communities as major stakeholders in the preservation and sustainable development of the site.

<text>The Japan News Network (JNN; ) is a Japanese commercial television network run by TBS Television, owned by TBS Holdings (which is a part of the major conglomerate Mitsui Group). The network&#x27;s responsibility includes the syndication of national television news bulletins to its regional affiliates, and news exchange between the stations. Its affiliate stations also broadcast non-news programs originating from TBS Television. Founded on 1 August 1959, JNN is made up of 28 full-time affiliates.

It also operates the 24-hour satellite and cable news channel [[Japan News Network|TBS News]] and the FAST Channel TBS NEWS DIG.

==History==

=== Initial news exchange agreement ===
In 1956, when there were only four commercial television stations in Japan (Nippon Television, Tokyo Radio and Television (hereinafter referred to as KRT), Osaka Television Broadcasting, and Chubu Nippon Broadcasting), the television network was quite loose. Nippon Television and KRT in Tokyo had to sell their programs to the two commercial stations (Osaka TV Broadcasting and Chubu Nippon Broadcasting) outside of Tokyo as much as possible in order to recoup their production costs and meet the needs of advertisers. This puts the two stations in an advantageous position by allowing them to freely choose the programs they want to syndicate.On 15 November 1956, four commercial television stations signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Television Broadcasting Program Exchange among Four Companies, which specifically stipulated matters related to the syndication of programs.Later, Hokkaido Broadcasting and RKB Mainichi Broadcasting joined the agreement, and the four-company agreement was expanded to a six-company agreement. There were no major changes in the contents of the agreement at that time.

The agreement later expanded into 10 member stations as Sanyo Broadcasting, Nishinippon Broadcasting, Yomiuri TV, and Television Nishinippon joined into the agreement. With that, the contents of the agreement were drastically changed, centering on special contributions.In October 1957, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued licenses for 34 commercial TV broadcasters as it became the period of rapid expansion of commercial broadcasters in Japan. The opening of commercial television outside the metropolitan area meant that the importance of interconnection was increasing.During this period, only a limited number of frequencies available were allocated to few broadcasters, resulting in limited affiliation options for the succeeding broadcasters.

In October 1958, Osaka Television Broadcasting, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Sanyo Broadcasting were explicitly part of the same syndication as KRT, while the Nippon Television syndication consisted of Yomiuri TV, Television Nishinippon, and Nishinippon Broadcasting, and the other three were cross-networked with a slight advantage for KRT.

At that time, Nippon Television, which had its own highlight programs such as baseball broadcasts, was trying to expand its network through the broadcasting rights of sports events. In response to the increasing competition with the broadcaster at that time, it then aired drama and news programming.The lack of nationwide coverage for commercial broadcasting in Japan makes it even more crucial for local operators to work together while gathering news.In June 1958, KRT, Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting System, Osaka Television Broadcasting, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Hokkaido Broadcasting began to exchange news materials through a network agreement.

=== Establishment of Japan News Network ===

The broadcast of the wedding of Crown Prince Akihito (later the 125th Emperor, now Emperor Emeritus) and Crown Princess Michiko (now Empress Emerita) on 1 April 1959, played an important role in bringing about the final signing of the news agreement. On 1 August 1959, with the signing of the new news agreement, the first true national commercial TV network in the country - Japan News Network - was formally established.

The charter members of the network were: KRT (now known as TBS Television), the network flagship station, Hokkaido Broadcasting, Tohoku Broadcasting, Shizuoka Broadcasting, Shin-etsu Broadcasting, Broadcasting System of Niigata, Hokuriku Broadcasting, Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting, Osaka Television Broadcasting (which later merged with Asahi Broadcasting Corporation), Nihonkai Telecasting, Sanyo Broadcasting, RCC Broadcasting, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, Nagasaki Broadcasting, Kumamoto Broadcasting, and Minaminihon Broadcasting.Upon the establishment, it already had 16 stations or covered about 80% of Japan&#x27;s population at that time.Prior to its establishment, there were proposed names for the network which includes Sakura News Network and All-Japan News Network (not to be confused with All-Nippon News Network, which was established in 1970), but it then adopted the current name at the end. As stipulated in the network agreement:

* TBS and the member affiliates of the JNN network agreed, upon the creation of JNN, to share news information between the networks while providing both national content for JNN programming produced by TBS and regional news items for their respective programs within their broadcast markers
* TBS&#x27; non-news programming are to be aired on the JNN network as well
* TBS prohibited the regional members from airing programming, including news, from its competitor stations

In the early days, each station was free to replace the title of the news program, but on 31 March 1975, after the affiliation change in Kansai from Asahi Broadcasting TV to Mainichi Broadcasting, all network member stations&#x27; news branding was unified on the JNN system, with TBS-produced newscasts airing on the regional stations while regional broadcasters provided local content and reporters and news crews for the national programs.

Until 1992 (when i-Television in Ehime became the last broadcaster to be affiliated with JNN), multiple broadcasters either dropped their affiliation with JNN (such as Nihonkai Telecasting when Broadcasting System of San-in started broadcasting) or have joined JNN upon their establishment (such as Iwate Broadcasting Company, Ryukyu Broadcasting, and Aomori Television). At present, it consists of 28 full-time stations. There are no JNN member stations in Akita, Fukui, Tokushima, and Saga prefectures.

==List of affiliates==
Stations are listed mostly in Japanese order of prefectures which is mirrored in ISO 3166-2:JP, with exceptions for the Kantō region, Aichi-Gifu-Mie, Kansai region (except Mie), Tottori-Shimane and Okayama-Kagawa, which form single wide broadcasting markets respectively. Some broadcasters listed here also have radio operations (either under a single company or as a subsidiary of its holding company).

<text>Jesús Colón (1901–1974) was a Puerto Rican writer known as the Father of the Nuyorican movement. An activist and community organizer, Colón wrote poetry and stories about his experiences as an Afro-Puerto Rican living in New York.

==Early years==
Colón was born on January 20, 1901, in Cayey, Puerto Rico, after the Spanish–American War when the American Tobacco Company gained control of most of the tobacco producing land in Puerto Rico. His parents were Mauricio Colón, his father, and Paula Lopez Cedeño, his mother. His father was a baker and his family owned the &quot;Colon Hotel&quot;. His home was behind the town&#x27;s cigar factory, which hired &quot;readers&quot; to read stories and current events to the employees whilst they worked. As a child, Colón visited the factory to listen to these stories. He was exposed to the writings of Karl Marx and Émile Zola, as well as literary classics like Miguel de Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote. From these ideas he formed a personal socialist ideology and also an interest in both the spoken and written word. The family moved to San Juan where he attended and continued his education at the José Julián Acosta School. 

When he was a teenager while in San Juan, Colón, alongside his brother Joaquin, attended the Central Grammar High School where he participated in different organizations, such as his school&#x27;s journal &quot;Adelante&quot; for which he was the director. He was also the President of the literary society of the school, titled the Manuel Fernández Juncos literary society. He was also an active member of the Socialist Party while in high school.

==Acclimating to New York City==

In 1917, when he was 16, Colón boarded the SS Carolina as a stowaway, hiding in a linen closet to secure passage. During the trip, a member of the crew found him and he was required to work in the ship&#x27;s kitchen as an employee. Because of his hard work, the captain of the ship offered him a job to stay aboard the ship and earn 30 dollars a day. He did not accept the job and when the ship docked in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918, he never returned to the ship.

Without much money, and not even a high school degree, Colón went to live with his older brother, Joaquin Colon, who was already residing in Brooklyn. He worked in various unskilled jobs, such as in different factories, as a dishwasher and waiter, as a postal clerk, and as a dockworker. As a result, he was able to observe the deplorable conditions of the working class of the time.

When Colón arrived in New York, he often wrote letters to his fiancée Rufa &quot;Concha&quot; Concepción Fernández, who remained in Puerto Rico. Seven years after Colón arrived, Concha made her way to New York on January 29, 1925, and reunited with Colón. The two were subsequently married on December 31, 1925, and resided in Brooklyn. When Colón became politically active, she acted as his secretary. She then became politically active and assisted in the founding of various community organizations. According to The Colón Papers, she became the secretary of &quot;la Liga Puertorriqueña e Hispana&quot; (The Puerto Rican and Hispanic League), which fostered mutual aid in the collective struggle and solidarity with all Hispanics in New York City. Her work contributed to the growth and acculturation of the New York Puerto Rican community. During their marriage, Concha would travel to Puerto Rico while Colón remained in New York, and the two often communicated through letters. They were married for 32 years.

Colón detailed many of his experiences navigating New York City in his writings. In a series titled &quot;A memo for series of articles on Puerto Ricans in NYC,&quot; Colón wrote about a broad array of social issues, such as police brutality, housing issues, economic issues, and politics in the city. He also talked about the racial relations that manifested in New York, with Puerto Ricans coming into contact with African Americans.

In addition, Colón became an active member of his New York community. He served as a member of the New York Committee of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party of which he helped to establish. This committee was not the only socialist party that Colón was involved in, as he would go on to help create other organizations such as the Puerto Rican organization &quot;Alianza Obrera Puertorriqueña&quot; created in 1923. Colón sought to defend Puerto Rican workers and help them in their efforts to unionize for better conditions. In 1926, he helped to found the organization &quot;Ateneo Obrero Hispano&quot; which sought to promote cultural and educational growth.

==Nuyorican Movement==

Colón was discriminated against because of the color of his skin (he was of African descent) and because of his difficulty speaking the English language. He wrote about his experiences, as well as the experiences of other immigrants, becoming among the first Puerto Ricans to do so in English. His best known work, &quot;A Puerto Rican in New York&quot;, set the stage for the literary movement known as the &quot;Nuyorican movement&quot;. Colón inspired other writers such as Piri Thomas, Esmeralda Santiago, Nicholasa Mohr, Pedro Pietri, and others.

Colón, in addition to the organizations he founded and served with, sought to write in various newspapers to project his political and personal thoughts. He also utilized pseudonyms while writing, going by the names Miquis Tiquis and Pericles Espada.

Colón began a Spanish language newspaper, and he would go on to write in both Spanish and English papers throughout his career. In 1927, he joined the editorial board of the New York City-based newspaper Gráfico (a newspaper edited by Bernardo Vega that featured writing by Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Latina/o migrants living in New York City). Gráfico was one of the Spanish-language newspapers he wrote for, and he wrote for it during the 1920s as a contributing columnist. Other Spanish-language papers that Colón wrote for include the papers &quot;Liberación&quot; and &quot;Pueblos Hispanos,&quot; both for which he wrote for during the 1940s.

One of the English-language papers that Colón wrote for was the communist press. In 1955, he wrote a regular column for the Daily Worker, another English-language paper. The Daily Worker was a publication of the Communist Party in New York. Colón titled his weekly column &quot;As I See It From Here,&quot; which appeared in the Daily Worker for two years; after 1957, the column moved to the newspaper titled &quot;Worker&quot; (a weekly version of the Daily Worker) for 10 years. Other publications that Colón contributed to include the &quot;Daily World,&quot; as a writer, and &quot;Mainstream&quot;, as an editor. Colón was also the president of &quot;Hispanic Publications&quot; which published history books, political pamphlets in Spanish, and literature.

In 1933, Colón decided to officially join the Communist Party USA, remaining part of the organization until his death. In the 1940s, Colón was president of the Cervantes Fraternal Society, the Spanish language division of the pro-Communist International Workers Order (IWO), a non-profit fraternal organization (life &amp; health insurance, social and cultural activities, etc.) made up of 16 ethnic/language groupings that, in total at its height, counted almost 200,000 members. (The Cervantes Fraternal Society, IWO, should not be confused with the Cervantes Society of America, an academic group.) The IWO, after being included on the U. S. Attorney General&#x27;s list of &quot;subversive organizations&quot; (the listing was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court), was dissolved by the NY State Supreme Court in 1951.

In the 1950s, during the McCarthy period, Colón was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He outraged the Committee when he stated &quot;I will not cooperate with this committee in its aim to destroy the Bill of Rights and other Constitutional rights of the people&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1969, Colón ran for the &quot;Office of Comptroller of the City of New York&quot;, running with Rasheed Storey, candidate for mayor on the Communist Party ticket. Neither candidate won.

Jesús Colón died in New York City on May 14, 1974. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, returned to Puerto Rico and scattered over the Río de la Plata, in Cayey; from there the river goes north and into the Atlantic Ocean.

Edna Acosta-Belen, professor of Latin American and Caribbean Studies at the University of Albany and Virginia Sanchez Korrol, associate professor and Chair of the Department of Puerto Rican Studies at Brooklyn College, put together a booklet of Colón&#x27;s writings called &quot;The Way it was and Other Writings&quot;. Jesus Colon&#x27;s niece (daughter of Joaquin), Olimpia Colón Aponte, is a retired writer who lives in Puerto Rico.

The Jesús Colón Papers, 1901-1974, the literary papers of Jesús Colón are held at the Archives of the Puerto Rican Diaspora Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños Hunter College, CUNY. The collection consists of &quot;letters, notes, drafts of published and unpublished works, reports, clippings, and photographs with a majority of the papers consisting of organizational records such as by-laws, minutes, membership lists, programs, and policy statements.&quot;

== Literary themes ==
Colón, in addition to writing for different newspapers and working for community organizations, also had different literary publications. In 1961 he published &quot;A Puerto Rican in New York, and other sketches,&quot; containing various vignettes about his life. He also had two posthumous collections, titled &quot;Lo que el pueblo me dice--: crónicas de la colonia puertorriqueña en Nueva York&quot; and &quot;The way it was, and other writings: historical vignettes about the New York Puerto Rican community.&quot; In addition to these works, there is also The Jesús Colón Papers. Many of the themes that Colón wrote about in his various newspaper columns also appeared in his literature.

One theme that Colón often wrote about included the topic of race and, in particular, his own racial experience of being African-American. In one poem, titled &quot;Black is Beautiful,&quot; written in Spanish, Colón writes about his race as being beautiful. In one Vignette from &quot;A Puerto Rican in New York, and other sketches&quot; titled &quot;The Mother, the Young Daughter, Myself, and All of Us,&quot; Colón writes about being called a racial slur by a young white girl, despite Colón having never spoken a word to her.

Another theme that appears in Colón&#x27;s literature is related to the struggle of the lower classes. In a poem from The Jesús Colón Papers titled &quot;Acrostico,&quot; Colón writes about those who are forced to work every day and compares them to slaves. Colón also wrote about class struggles in a vignette titled &quot;Two Men With But One Pair of Pants,&quot; as Colón detailed how he used to share a pair of work pants with his brother, Joaquin. After Colón arrived in New York, the two brothers, despite both having a job, could not afford to pay for another pair of pants. As a result, they would share the pants together. It was not until a man gave Colón 10 dollars that the two were able to have their own pair of pants.

<doc id="981465" wikidata="Q710705" url="?curid=981465" title="Yi Xing">
<text>Yi Xing (, 683–727), born Zhang Sui (), was a Chinese astronomer, Buddhist monk, inventor, mathematician, mechanical engineer, and philosopher during the Tang dynasty. His astronomical celestial globe featured a liquid-driven escapement, the first in a long tradition of Chinese astronomical clockworks.
==Science and technology==
===Astrogeodetic survey===
In the early 8th century, the Tang court put Yi Xing in charge of an astrogeodetic survey. This survey had many purposes. It was established in order to obtain new astronomical data that would aid in the prediction of solar eclipses. The survey was also initiated so that flaws in the calendar system could be corrected and a new, updated calendar installed in its place. 

The survey was also essential in determining the arc measurement, i.e., the length of meridian arc-although Yi Xing, who did not know the Earth was spherical, did not conceptualize his measurements in these terms. This would resolve the confusion created by the earlier practice of using the difference between shadow lengths of the sun observed at the same time at two places to determine the ground distance between them. 

Yi Xing had thirteen test sites established throughout the empire, extending from Jiaozhou in Vietnam — at latitude 17°N — to the region immediately south of Lake Baikal — latitude 50°N. There were three observations done for each site, one for the height of polaris, one for the shadow lengths of summer, and one for the shadow lengths of winter. The latitudes were determined from this data, while the Tang calculation for the length of one degree of meridian was fairly accurate compared to modern calculations. Yi Xing understood the variations in the length of a degree of meridian, and criticized earlier scholars who permanently fixed an estimate for shadow lengths for the duration of the entire year.

===The escapement and celestial globe===
Yi Xing was famed for his genius, known to have calculated the number of possible positions on a go board game (though without a symbol for zero as he had difficulties expressing the number). He, along with his associate, the mechanical engineer and politician Liang Lingzan, is best known for applying the earliest-known escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. However, Yi Xing&#x27;s mechanical achievements were built upon the knowledge and efforts of previous Chinese mechanical engineers, such as the statesman and master of gear systems Zhang Heng (78–139) of the Han dynasty, the mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200–265) of the Three Kingdoms, and the Daoist Li Lan (c. 450) of the Southern and Northern Dynasties period.

It was the earlier Chinese inventor Zhang Heng during the Han dynasty who was the first to apply hydraulic power (i.e. a waterwheel and water clock) in mechanically-driving and rotating his equatorial armillary sphere. The arrangement followed the model of a water-wheel using the drip of a clepsydra (see water clock), which ultimately exerted force on a lug to rotate toothed-gears on a polar-axis shaft. With this, the slow computational movement rotated the armillary sphere according to the recorded movements of the planets and stars. Yi Xing also owed much to the scholarly followers of Ma Jun, who had employed horizontal jack-wheels and other mechanical toys worked by waterwheels. The Daoist Li Lan was an expert at working with water clocks, creating steelyard balances for weighing water that was used in the tank of the clepsydra, providing more inspiration for Yi Xing. Like the earlier water-power employed by Zhang Heng and the later escapement mechanism in the astronomical clock tower engineered and erected by Su Song (1020–1101), Yi Xing&#x27;s celestial globe employed water-power in order for it to rotate and function properly.

The British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham states (Wade–Giles spelling):

In regards to mercury instead of water (as noted in the quote above), the first to apply liquid mercury for motive power of an armillary sphere was Zhang Sixun in 979 AD (because mercury would not freeze during winter). During his age, the Song dynasty (960–1279) era historical text of the &quot;Song Shi&quot; mentions Yi Xing and the reason why his armillary sphere did not survive the ages after the Tang (Wade–Giles spelling):

Earlier Tang era historical texts of the 9th century have this to say of Yi Xing&#x27;s work in astronomical instruments in the 8th century (Wade–Giles spelling):


==Buddhist scholarship==
Yi Xing wrote a commentary on the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. This work had a strong influence on the Japanese monk Kūkai and was key in his establishment of Shingon Buddhism.

==In his honor==

At the Tiantai-Buddhist Guoqing Temple of Mount Tiantai in Zhejiang Province, there is a Chinese pagoda erected directly outside the temple known as the Memorial Pagoda of Monk Yi Xing. His tomb is also located on Mount Tiantai.

<text>A tunic is a garment for the torso, usually simple in style, reaching from the shoulders to a length somewhere between the hips and the ankles. It might have arm-sleeves, either short or full-length. Most forms have no fastenings. The name derives from the Latin &quot;tunica&quot;, the basic garment worn by both men and women in Ancient Rome, which in turn was based on earlier Greek garments that covered wearers&#x27; waists.

The term is likely borrowed from a Semitic word *&quot;kittan&quot; with metathesis. The word khiton () is of the same origin.

==Ancient era==
===Roman tunic===
The Roman &quot;tunica&quot; was adopted by the Roman citizens in the 3rd century BCE. It was often worn by Roman citizens and by non-citizens alike. However, citizens might wear it under the toga, especially at formal occasions.

The length of the garment, the presence or lack of stripes, as well as their width and ornamentation, would indicate the wearer&#x27;s status in Roman society. Roman senators, for example, used the &quot;laticlavus&quot;, with broad purple stripes, and members of the equestrian class wore the &quot;Angusticlavia&quot;, with narrower stripes. Soldiers, slaves and manual workers generally had tunics to a little above the knee; those in more sedentary occupations to about the ankle (unless they were expecting to ride a horse, when a shorter one would be worn).

The tunic or chiton was worn as a shirt or gown by all genders among the ancient Romans. The body garment was loose-fitting for males, usually beginning at the neck and ending above the knee. A woman&#x27;s garment could be either close fitting or loose, beginning at the neck and extending over a skirt or skirts.

===Greek tunic===

Tunics were also worn in ancient Greece, whence the Roman version was adopted. Later Greek and Roman tunics were an evolution from the very similar chiton, chitoniskos, and exomis, each of which can be considered versions of the garment. In ancient Greece, a person&#x27;s tunic was decorated at the hemline to represent the polis (city-state) in which he lived. Tunics might be dyed with bright colours like red, purple, or green.

There was also the &quot;sisúra&quot; (), which according to Pollux was a tunic with sleeves of skins. According to the Suda, it was a type of inexpensive cloak, like a one-shoulder tunic. The &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities&quot; mentions that it seems to have been more of a cloak than a tunic, and was worn for warmth or used to sleep in. According to the same source, late authors may use the term to mean a piece of cloth.

===Celtic tunic===
Tunics worn by the Celts were documented by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus:

===Germanic tunic===

The various Celtic and Germanic peoples living in the colder Middle and Northern Europe wore long-sleeved tunics from as long back as pictorial evidence goes. Such tunics are often found depicted on the various Roman monuments depicting victories over these peoples and show the tunic as a simple pull-over construction reaching to the mid-thighs or the knees. Similar tunics were eventually taken up by the Romans and continued to be used into the Byzantine period.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the long-sleeved Celto-Germanic tunic continued to be worn. The construction was more elaborate than the earlier Graeco-Roman garment, with a tight-fitting neck with a split down the front for pulling it over the head, and gusset under the arms and inserted around the lower half to give a flaring skirt. Being used by both Vikings and Normans, the garment continued as a general male garment into the Middle Ages, still being used in Norway as late as the 17th century.

=== Indian tunic ===
Indus valley civilization figurines depict both women and men wearing a tunic-like garment. A terracotta model called Lady of the Spiked Throne depicts two standing turban-wearing men wearing what appears to be a conical gown marked by a dense series of thin vertical incisions that might suggest stiffened cloth. A similar gold disc in the al-Sabah Collection from the Kuwait National Museum appears to be from the Indus Valley civilization and depicts similar conical tunic-wearing men holding two bulls by their tails under a pipal tree shown in an Indus-like mirror symmetry. A mother goddess figurine from the 
National Museum, New Delhi, shows a female wearing a short tight tunic.

Worn in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the tunic is usually referred to as kurta. An Asian tunic is typically adorned with delicate embroidery, bead-work or intricate threadwork as well. Embroidery or thread work on such tunics usually combines threads of many different colors.

=== Vietnamese tunic ===

Vietnamese tunics are called &quot;áo dài&quot;, is a garment now customarily worn by both Vietnamese men and women. It is similar to the kurta of the Indian subcontinent countries, and the cheongsam of China.

The &quot;áo dài&quot; was developed from the clothing worn in Chinese court but it could only be worn by the royalty originally. The &quot;áo dài&quot; was derived from &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; (lit. &#x27;five-panel gown&#x27;) which was a Nguyễn court fashion which drew strong influences from the civil and military official clothing practices used in China; the &quot;áo dài&quot; also evolved from the early prototypes decreed by Nguyễn Phúc Khoát.

In the 18th century, in an attempt to separate his domain from Tonkin ruled by his rival Trịnh clan and build an independent state, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (reigned 1738–1765) forced his subjects to wear Ming dynasty style Chinese clothing. The ethnic Kinh robe (i.e. the traditional &quot;áo giao lĩnh&quot;, a type of crossed-collar robe, which was identical to the ones worn by the Han Chinese). was, therefore, replaced by a robe with Chinese-style fasteners, which was buttoned in the front, and had an upright collar. The skirt which was worn by the Vietnamese was also replaced by trousers under his rule. This form of new fashion became the prototype of the &quot;áo dài&quot;; it was a form of &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; which was invented by Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát; the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; also had 5 flaps instead of 4 (the 5th flap was small and was found under the front garment) and 5 buttons. Another new form of fashion included a type of four-panel robe which was described by Lê Quý Đôn as an &quot;áo dài&quot; which was loose fitting similarly to the &quot;á&quot;o giao lãnh. Under the rule of Emperor Minh Mạng, two new forms of &quot;áo dài&quot; were created from the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; regulated by Nguyễn Phúc Khoát: the &quot;áo tứ thân&quot;, and the &quot;Huế-style áo dài&quot; which was created with five flaps&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Huế-style áo dài&quot; represented royal court culture of the &quot;Huế&quot; and later developed influenced the modern &quot;áo dài&quot;.

==Medieval tunic==

The tunic continued to be the basic garment of the Byzantine Romans of both sexes throughout the medieval period. The upper classes wore other garments atop the basic tunic, such as the &quot;dalmatica&quot;, a heavier and shorter type of tunic, again, worn by both sexes, or the &quot;scaramangion&quot;, a riding-coat of Persian origin. Except for the military or riding dress, men and women of higher status wore tunics that came down to the ankles, or nearly so. Tunics were often dyed or richly embroidered, although the plainer ones could be used when layering different types.

Beyond the reduced empire, the tunic continued to be worn with varying sleeve and hem lengths throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. Often reaching the knees or ankles, it was usually worn over underclothes consisting of a shirt (usually hip-length or longer) and drawers (usually knee- or ankle-length pants related to braccae). It may be accompanied by hose. Wool and linen were common fabrics used, though the wealthy sometimes wore fancy silk tunics or a lesser fabric with silk trim. In English the garment was referred to as a &quot;sark&quot;, and this word survives in some northern UK dialects to mean a shirt or chemise.

Tunics worn during the Early Middle Ages often featured decorative embroidery or tablet-woven braids along the neck, hem and wrists. This was the case, for instance, with tunics worn by both rich and poor Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest.

==Modern tunic==
Around 1830, small boys began to be dressed in sashed or belted tunics over trousers, a fashion which replaced the earlier skeleton suit.

During the Crimean War in the 1850s, it was realized that the waist length jackets which had been worn by British soldiers since Napoleonic times were unsuitable for fighting in winter conditions. A new longer jacket was introduced which reached down to the mid thigh and this was named the &#x27;tunic&#x27; after the &#x27;tunica&#x27; of the intrepid ancient Roman soldier. This type of jacket soon became standard for most armies.

In Western culture, its use continues primarily in a religious and uniform context. It is the primary garment worn by the clergy and members of religious orders. The religious tunic reaches to the feet and was the source of the clerical cassock, as well as, in its liturgical form, the alb, after the long tunic worn by Roman citizens. &#x27;Tunic&#x27; is also the name often given to the high-collar uniform coat worn by military and police personnel. Light feminine garments, especially for sports or exercise, usually only coming down to mid-thigh, are also called tunics.

<text>Leadenhall Market is a covered market in London, England, located on Gracechurch Street but with vehicular access also available via Whittington Avenue to the north and Lime Street to the south and east, and additional pedestrian access via a number of narrow passageways.

It is one of the oldest markets in London, dating from the 14th century, and is located in the historic centre of the City of London financial district.

==History==
The market dates from the 14th century and is said to derive its name from &quot;Leather-hall&quot;, though it is disputable. The early history of Leaden Hall involves the Mayor (1446), Simon Eyre. According to John Stow, &quot;Eyre, a draper built Leaden Hall for a common garner of corn for the use of this city&quot;.

The Market is typically open weekdays from 10 am until 6 pm, and primarily sells fresh food; among the vendors there are cheesemongers, butchers and florists. Originally a meat, game and poultry market, it stands on what was the centre of Roman London. A number of commercial retailers are also located in the market, including clothes shops. The Lamb Tavern, dating from 1780, is a traditional gathering place for insurance industry workers, many of whom work at Lloyd&#x27;s of London adjacent to Leadenhall Market.

The ornate roof structure, painted green, maroon and cream, and cobbled floors of the current structure, designed in 1881 by Sir Horace Jones (who was also the architect of Billingsgate and Smithfield Markets), make Leadenhall Market a tourist attraction.

The main entrance to the market is on Gracechurch Street. The double height entrance is flanked by tall, narrow gabled red brick and Portland stone blocks in a 17th-century Dutch style. The adjacent buildings to the south have a continuous retail frontage which is punctuated by narrow entrances to pedestrian ways into the market.

Between 1990 and 1991 the market received a dramatic redecoration which improved its appearance, enhancing its architectural character and detail. The redecoration scheme received a special mention in the Civic Trust Awards in 1994. The market is a Grade II* listed building, being listed in 1972.

It was used to represent the area of London near the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and is featured in the films &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009), &quot;Hereafter&quot; (2010), &quot;Brannigan&quot; (1975), &quot;Hidden City&quot; (1987) and (2009). It was also used in the music video for the 1991 Erasure song &quot;Love to Hate You&quot;.

Leadenhall Market formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic Games; runners passed through the market from Whittington Avenue to Lime Street.

Furthermore, it is featured in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the London Loop Course .

Nearest public transit access: Monument or Bank on the Underground, Fenchurch Street or Cannon Street on the Overground.

<doc id="981475" wikidata="Q2246028" url="?curid=981475" title="François-Bernard Mâche">
<text>François-Bernard Mâche (born 4 April 1935, Clermont-Ferrand) is a French composer of contemporary music.

==Biography==
Born into a family of musicians, he is a former student of Émile Passani and Olivier Messiaen and has also received a diploma in Greek archaeology (1957) and a teaching certificate (Agrégation de Lettres classiques, 1958). He was a member of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales in Paris from 1958–63. He has composed electroacoustic, orchestral, chamber, choral, vocal and piano works. He has been a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts since 2002 and occupies the chair of the late Iannis Xenakis.

Mâche&#x27;s &quot;Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion&quot; (&quot;Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d&#x27;Arion&quot;) (1983, 1992 ), which as a whole argues for a return in composition to mythic thought, includes a study of &quot;ornitho-musicology&quot; using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet&#x27;s &quot;Langage, musique, poésie&quot; (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that birdsongs are organized according to a repetition-transformation principle. One purpose of the book was to “begin to speak of animal musics other than with the quotation marks”, and he is credited by Dario Martinelli with the creation of zoomusicology.

The book also describes the conception and composition of pieces by Mâche, where, &quot;As a starting point, he borrows a tonal model from reality which he then submits to a highly intricate process leading to abstraction.&quot; This technique leads Daniel Durney to describe Mâche as &quot;one of the rare exponents of the naturalistic trend in music.&quot; Models often include human speech and bird song. Given the extensive use of birdsong made by Messiaen, Mâche avoided using birdsong recordings in his own work until 1969: &quot;Naluan&quot; for ensemble and tape from 1974, &quot;systematically explores&quot; the model of birds; while &quot;Sopiana&quot; of 1980 pits recordings of Malayan shamas, icterine warblers and marsh warblers against the virtuosity of a live flute and piano. Recordings of birdsong, insect sounds, and other natural phenomena such as raindrops are integrated into &quot;Le printemps du serpent&quot; for large percussion ensemble of 2001. Earlier in Mâche&#x27;s composing career, recording of a poem by the modern Greek poet Giorgos Seferis, read by Mâche himself, formed the basis of the orchestral work &quot;La peau du silence&quot; (1962), and that of a text by Paul Éluard for &quot;Le son d&#x27;une voix&quot; for small orchestra in 1964.

Other major works include &quot;Kassandra&quot; for large ensemble and tape, which won the Italia Prize in 1977; &quot;Eridan&quot; (1986) and &quot;Moires&quot; (1994), both written for the Arditti Quartet; &quot;Kengir&quot; (1991), settings of ancient Sumerian love poems, and &quot;Manuel de résurrection&quot; (1998), setting texts from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, both written for the soprano Françoise Kubler and Ensemble &quot;Accroche Note&quot;. Several of Mâche&#x27;s works from the 1980s onwards make use of the sampling keyboard, notably &quot;L&#x27;estuaire du temps&quot; (1993) for sampler and large orchestra.

<text>Old Spitalfields Market is a covered market in Spitalfields, London. There has been a market on the site for over 350 years. In 1991 it gave its name to New Spitalfields Market in Leyton, where fruit and vegetables are now traded. In 2005, a regeneration programme resulted in the new public spaces: Bishops Square and Crispin Place, which are now part of the modern Spitalfields Market. A range of public markets runs daily, with independent local stores and restaurants - as well as new office developments.

It is situated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, just outside the City of London. The closest London Underground and mainline railway station is Liverpool Street.

==Historic market==

There has been a market on the site since 1638 when King Charles I gave a licence for flesh, fowl and roots to be sold on Spittle Fields, which was then a rural area on the eastern outskirts of London. After the rights to a market had seemingly lapsed during the time of the Commonwealth, the market was re-founded in 1682 by King Charles II in order to feed the burgeoning population of a new suburb of London.

Market buildings were sited on the rectangular patch of open ground which retained the name Spittle Fields: demarcated by Crispin Street to the west, Lamb Street to the north, Red Lion Street (later subsumed into Commercial Street) to the east and Paternoster Row (later known as Brushfield Street) to the south. The existing buildings were constructed between 1885 and 1893 to the designs of George Campbell Sherrin. They were commissioned by Robert Horner, the last private owner of the market, and remain known as the Horner Buildings.

The market was acquired by the City of London Corporation in 1920, to serve as a wholesale market. It was extended westward to Steward Street in 1926, destroying the northern extensions of Crispin Street and Gun Street in the process. The Cinema Museum in London holds extensive film of the market and its refrigeration systems in use between 1928 and 1930.

In 1991 the wholesale fruit and vegetable market moved to New Spitalfields Market, Leyton, and the original site became known as Spitalfields Market.

The market stalls were redesigned by architects Foster and Partners for Old Spitalfields Market in October 2017.

==Modern market==

Being at the centre of a revival in the area, the eastern end of Spitalfields retained its old charm in Horner Square and Horner Buildings, which are Grade II listed buildings. The Victorian buildings and the market hall and roof have been restored and Spitalfields is now one of London&#x27;s major markets. The market square is a popular fashion, arts and crafts, food and general market, open seven days a week, but is particularly busy at weekends. Operationally, the area is run as two adjacent marketplaces: &quot;Old Spitalfields Market&quot; to the east, and the 1926 extension of &quot;Spitalfields Market&quot; to the west.

In the late 20th century, there was a dispute between the owners, the City of London Corporation and local residents about the redevelopment of the 1926 market extension at the western end. The Corporation won, and now a Norman Foster-designed office block surrounds the western side of the site, after two-thirds of the historic market were rebuilt to include restaurants, shops and a large indoor arts and crafts market, called the Traders&#x27; Market.

The Gun, a pub situated to the south of the market buildings, recalls Tudor times, when the Old Artillery Ground in this area was used by the Honourable Artillery Company to practice with cross-bow, and later guns and artillery pieces.

At the east end, and on the other side of Commercial Street, is Christ Church, a large Nicholas Hawksmoor church.

In January 2011 Spitalfields received the &quot;Best Private Market&quot; award by the National Association of British Market Authorities.
Old Spitalfields Market currently hosts a vintage market each Thursday, a vinyl fair some Fridays and a general arts and craft market throughout the week continuing through to the weekend.

<text>Avalonia was a microcontinent in the Paleozoic era. Crustal fragments of this former microcontinent underlie south-west Great Britain, southern Ireland, and the eastern coast of North America. It is the source of many of the older rocks of Western Europe, Atlantic Canada, and parts of the coastal United States. Avalonia is named for the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland.

Avalonia developed as a volcanic arc on the northern margin of Gondwana. It eventually rifted off, becoming a drifting microcontinent. The Rheic Ocean formed behind it, and the Iapetus Ocean shrank in front. It collided with the continents Baltica, then Laurentia, and finally with Gondwana, ending up in the interior of Pangea. When Pangea broke up, Avalonia&#x27;s remains were divided by the rift which became the Atlantic Ocean.

== Extent ==

When the term &quot;Avalon&quot; was first coined by Canadian geologist Harold Williams in 1964, he included only Precambrian rocks in eastern Newfoundland. More than a decade later he extended the term to include all exotic rocks from Newfoundland down to Rhode Island. Since the introduction of the term terrane in the 1980s, Avalonia has been referred to as &quot;platform&quot;, &quot;composite terrane&quot;, &quot;superterrane&quot;, &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West Avalonia&quot;, and &quot;Avalon sensu lato&quot;. &quot;Avalonia&quot; can thus refer exclusively to rocks in Newfoundland (Avalonia &quot;sensu stricto&quot;), an assembly of terranes, or a single tectonic unit.

Avalonia is the largest of the peri-Gondwanan terranes, a series of continental blocks that more or less simultaneously broke off the margins of the southern supercontinent Gondwana and therefore share an early Paleozoic marine fauna. They were pulled northward and eventually collided to form the Appalachian, Caledonide, and Variscan orogens. West Avalonia, in North America, stretches from New England to Atlantic Canada, and East Avalonia, in Europe, from southern Britain to Brabant.

Other Peri-Gondwanan terranes, sometimes called &quot;Greater Avalonia&quot;, include Carolina in the Appalachian and the deep bedrock of Florida in North America, Oaxaquia and Yucatán in Mexico, and the Chortis Block in Central America. The North American terranes of Ganderia and Carolinia are sometimes grouped with Avalonia because they were transferred together across the Iapetus Ocean. Sometimes the Meguma terrane in Nova Scotia is also included.

The Avalonian part of Great Britain almost exactly coincides with England and Wales. Elsewhere in Europe, parts of Avalonia are found in the Ardennes of Belgium and north-eastern France, north Germany, north-western Poland, south-eastern Ireland, and the south-western edge of the Iberian Peninsula.

Part of the British-Belgian section formed an island in the Carboniferous, affecting the disposition of coalfields; this is known by names such as the &#x27;London-Brabant Island&#x27;. Its bulk had an effect on the geological structure between the Ardennes and the English Midlands by influencing the subsequent crustal folding resulting from the Variscan collision.

In Canada, Avalonia comprises the Avalon Peninsula of southeast Newfoundland, southern New Brunswick, part of Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, Avalonia consists of northern coastal Maine, all of Rhode Island, and other sections of coastal New England.

== Development ==
The basement of Avalonia is poorly known, but, based on isotopic analyses, proto-Avalonia most likely evolved together with Carolina about 800 Ma from volcanic arcs far offshore from the supercontinent Rodinia, most likely outboard continental terranes of more obvious West African affinities, such as Cadomia and Iberia. About 650 Ma the Avalonian belt collided with Gondwana.

Avalonia originally developed along the shores of Rodinia together with island arcs now found in the Arabian-Nubian Shield (900–700 Ma) and Tocantins in central Brazil (950–900 Ma) and the basement of Avalonia is most likely of the same age.

During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, Avalonia was located in a cool-water environment and even underwent a glaciation. The Moroccan Anti-Atlas range in West Gondwana was, in contrast, characterised by evaporites, evidence of desiccation, and had thrombolites. Avalonia and Gondwana must therefore have been located far from each other during this period. The two did, however, share a geological history from later in the early Cambrian until the mid-Orodovician.

Subduction evolved along the shores of Gondwana, which caused Avalonia to rift away and begin its northbound journey towards Baltica during late Cambrian and Early Ordovician. The Rheic Ocean opened behind the Avalonian microcontinents. This independent movement of Avalonia started from a latitude of about 60° South.

The eastern end of Avalonia collided with Baltica at 30°S, an event which closed the Tornquist Sea, during the Late Ordovician. In Avalonia, folding, faulting, and volcanism followed – as evidenced in the Welsh Borderland and the Taconic deformation in Laurentia – some or all of which are related to the collision. Plinian eruptions resulted from the subduction beneath Avalonia and produced thick layers of K-bentonite in southwestern Baltica, while the Millbrig eruptions occurred in Laurentia. This Late Ordovician magmatism peaked between 457 and 449 Ma.

In the late Silurian and lower Devonian, the combined Baltica and Avalonia collided progressively with Laurentia, beginning with the long extremity of Avalonia, which is now attached to North America. The result of this was the formation of Euramerica. At the completion of this stage, the site of Britain was at 30°S and Nova Scotia at about 45°S. This collision is represented by the Caledonian folding or in North America as an early phase in the Acadian orogeny.

In the Carboniferous, the new continent and another terrane, Armorica which included Iberia, drifted in from Gondwana, trapping Avalonia between it and the continent so adding Iberia/Armorica to Euramerica. This was followed up by the arrival of Gondwana. The effects of these collisions are seen in Europe as the Variscan folding. In North America it shows as later phases of the Acadian orogeny. This was happening at around the Equator during the later Carboniferous, forming Pangaea with Avalonia near its centre but partially flooded by shallow sea.

In the Jurassic, Pangaea split into Laurasia and Gondwana, with Avalonia as part of Laurasia. In the Cretaceous, Laurasia broke up into North America and Eurasia with Avalonia split between them.

Iberia was later rotated away again as the African part of Gondwana strike-slipped past it. This last movement caused the Alpine orogeny including the raising of the Pyrenees during the Miocene and Pliocene. As a result of this, part of Avalonia is now to be found on each side of the Straits of Gibraltar.

<text>ETV Network is a network of Telugu language news and entertainment satellite television channels in India. It is based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It also had some non Telugu-language satellite television channels. All non-Telugu satellite television channels were acquired by Reliance Industries-owned TV18 for ₹2,053 crore in FY 2014–15 and later rebranded.

==History==
===Telugu language network===

The Hyderabad daily newspaper &quot;Eenadu&quot; (Telugu for &#x27;today&#x27;) started its own Telugu language channel named Eenadu TV on 27 August 1995. 

The flagship company ETPL launched four new television channels in November 2015 – namely ETV Life – a health and wellness channel, ETV Abhiruchi, a cookery channel, ETV Plus – an entertainment and reality channel, and ETV Cinema – a movie channel in Telugu language. In May 2014, ETV2 and ETV3 were renamed to ETV Andhra Pradesh and ETV Telangana respectively.

On 27 December 2018, the network launched ETV Plus HD, ETV Life HD, ETV Abhiruchi HD, and ETV Cinema HD.

===Non-Telugu language TV assets===
The network also added regional channels in other Indian languages and built a large local news network using ETV brand after success in the Telugu-speaking region. Ramoji Group sold its non Telugu language TV assets to TV18 in January 2014 with a permission to use ETV brand name.

In March 2015, TV18&#x27;s Viacom18 decided to rebrand all five non-Telugu language ETV regional general entertainment channels. ETV Marathi, ETV Gujarati, ETV Kannada, ETV Bangla and ETV Odia were rebranded into Colors Marathi, Colors Gujarati, Colors Kannada, Colors Bangla and Colors Odia, respectively.

In March 2018, non-Telugu language TV assets of TV18 still using the ETV brand were rebranded as part of the News18 network.

In April 2016, ETV network added three more regional news channels catering to the audience of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and North East under the brand name of News18. The channels are named News18 Kerala, News18 Tamil Nadu and News18 Assam-NE.

<text>The Messerschmitt Bf 162 was a light bomber aircraft designed in Germany prior to World War II, which flew only in prototype form.

==Design and development==
The Bf 162 was designed in response to a 1935 RLM (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;, Reich Aviation Ministry) specification for a &quot;schnellbomber&quot; (&quot;fast bomber&quot;) for tactical use. Messerschmitt&#x27;s design was a modified Bf 110 with a glazed nose to accommodate a bombardier. In 1937, three prototypes were flown against rival designs, the Junkers Ju 88 and the Henschel Hs 127, both entirely new aircraft.

It was eventually decided that the Ju 88 be selected for production, and development of the Bf 162 ended. As a disinformation tactic, images of the Bf 162 were widely circulated in the German press, captioned as the &quot;Messerschmitt Jaguar&quot;, a name never used outside this context.

This aircraft&#x27;s RLM official airframe number of &quot;8-162&quot; was later re-used for the Heinkel He 162 jet fighter.

<text>Badachro () is a former fishing village, in the northwest Highlands of Scotland.

==Geography==
Badachro sits about 3 km south of Gairloch on the shore of Gair Loch, and is a natural harbour popular with yachts. Approximately 2 miles to the SE are located the Fairy Lochs, the site of a 1945 plane crash which is now a designated war grave. The crash site has been preserved as a memorial to the USAAF servicemen who lost their lives in the accident and is accessible by a rough track near the Shieldaig Lodge Hotel.

Badachro is in the Highland Council area.

Queen Victoria visited Shieldaig Lodge Hotel in 1877 but never made it to Badchro village itself as the roads were too bad. Today Shieldaig Lodge is home to a small watersports centre Gairloch Canoe and Kayak Centre.

==Fishing==
At the end of the nineteenth century, Badachro was a busy fishing village. Codlanded here and at Gairloch, was dried at one of two curing stations at Badachro - one on Eilean Horrisdale (cured by resident Kenneth BAIN, master seaman) and one on Eilean Tioram. Today, lobsters, crabs , and prawns are landed for markets in the south and Europe.

<text>Ernest W. Twining (March 29, 1875 - September 10, 1956) was a modelmaker, artist, and engineer.

==Biography==
Ernest Twining was born in Bristol, England, and was trained as a telephone engineer. He also took art lessons at night school. After working on the Glasgow telephone system for a while, he established a commercial art studio in London, where, as a side-line, he branched out into designing and making model aircraft for sale, in due course expanding to the manufacture of full size gliders.

==Twining Models==
His model-making work brought him into contact with Bassett-Lowke, the Northampton model making firm, for whom he did sub-contract work. In 1920 he founded Twining Models at Northampton, which manufactured glass-case models of industrial, architectural, advertising and transport themes.

==Other interests==
Twining was polymathic in his interests, and was active in the worlds of model railways, art and design, aeronautics, astronomy and photography, ships and ship models, and stained glass.

In Northampton, his windows can be found at Holy Trinity Church Hall, St Edmunds, Hardingstone, St Francis de Sales, Wolverton and the Northampton Museum.

==Writing==
Twining was also a prolific author, writing for numerous hobby magazines, and wrote several books, the most notable being:
* &quot;The Art and Craft of Stained Glass&quot; (1928), long regarded as the best textbook available.
* &quot;Art in Advertising&quot; (1931) (with Dorothy E. M. Holditch).
* &quot;Indoor Model Railways&quot; (1937)

==World War II==
Twining sold out his interest in his business in 1940, and moved back to Bristol where he spent the war years on the staff of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, working as a draughtsman. After the war he worked for a Bristol stained glass firm, helping repair damaged glass in bombed churches. Twining died at Bristol in 1956.

==In Japan==
A 15-inch gauge miniature steam locomotive named &quot;Ernest W. Twining&quot; exists in Japan at the Shuzenji Romney Railway in Shizuoka Prefecture. This originally worked at Dudley Zoo in the UK before moving to the Fairbourne Railway in 1961. It was a freelance 4-6-2 (2-C-1) Pacific tender loco designed by Twining and built by G &amp; S Light Engineering &amp; Maintenance Co., Ltd. in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in 1950 to Works No. 10. Although the worksplate which it has states year built as 1949, this is incorrect, and the plate was fitted by the Fairbourne Railway, not by the builder. Driving wheels are 20&quot; diameter, with two cylinders of 5 1/16&quot; diameter, 8&quot; stroke and piston valves. The locomotive is equipped with steam brakes, and hand brakes on the tender. Bogie tender air brakes and a new boiler were fitted in 1961.

On page 104 of “Preserved Steam Locomotives of Britain” published in 1982 by Blandford Press, to accompany the colour plate No. 36 showing a blue liveried Ernest Twining about to start its train of open carriages at Fairbourne Railway, the author Colin Garratt wrote “This engine was originally built as a 15” miniature gauge Black 5 for the Dudley Zoo Railway by Guest of Stourbridge. In 1966, she was rebuilt into a Pacific with British colonial pretensions and now works on the Fairbourne Railway. The engine is a representative of the Greenly school of practice.

<text>Fort Edmonton (also named Edmonton House) was the name of a series of trading posts of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) from 1795 to 1914, all of which were located on the north banks of the North Saskatchewan River in what is now central Alberta, Canada. It was one of the last points on the Carlton Trail, the main overland route for Metis freighters between the Red River Colony and the points west and was an important stop on the York Factory Express route between London, via Hudson Bay, and Fort Vancouver in the Columbia District. It also was a connection to the Great Northland, as it was situated relatively close to the Athabasca River whose waters flow into the Mackenzie River and the Arctic Ocean. Located on the farthest north of the major rivers flowing to the Hudson Bay and the HBC&#x27;s shipping posts there, Edmonton was for a time the southernmost of the HBC&#x27;s forts.

From 1795 to 1830 it was located in four successive locations. Prior to 1821 each location was paired with a Fort Augustus of the North West Company (NWC). Sometimes other fur companies also built forts nearby as well.

The fifth and final Fort Edmonton, 1830–1914, was the one that evolved into present-day Edmonton.

Fort Edmonton was also called Fort-des-Prairies, by French-Canadians trappers and coureurs des bois, and or &quot;Beaver Hills House&quot; in Cree, the most spoken Indigenous language in the region during the 19th century.

In the late 18th century, the HBC, established in 1670, was in fierce competition with the NWC for the trade of animal furs in Rupert&#x27;s Land.

As one company established a fur trading post, the other would counter by building its post in close proximity or even farther upstream. Expansion up the Saskatchewan River was heated in the 1790s.

==First Fort Edmonton (1795–1802)==

In the summer of 1795, the North West Company constructed Fort Augustus where the Sturgeon River meets the North Saskatchewan River, just north of the present-day city of Fort Saskatchewan, approximately northeast of the final Fort Edmonton (near the present-day Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton). A few months later (on Oct. 5, 1795), Hudson&#x27;s Bay began to construct Edmonton House close by, taking advantage of the same two rivers; in a possible revelation of the competitive nature of the companies, Fort Augustus and Edmonton House&#x27;s distance was described as being a &quot;musket-shot&quot; apart, yet the proximity also offered mutual security to the European traders of both companies in a land where they were all intruders.

Edmonton House, and the subsequent forts, was named by John Peter Pruden, clerk to the HBC&#x27;s George Sutherland. The Fort was named after Edmonton, Middlesex, England, birthplace of both Pruden and HBC Deputy Governor Sir James Winter Lake.

In addition to the NWC-HBC rivalry, two or three competing fur-trading posts were also built nearby. Grants Company, independent fur buyer Francois Beaubien and the new North West Company (XY Company) reportedly built forts near Fort Edmonton/Fort Augustus located at Fort Saskatchewan and Rossdale.

==Second Fort Edmonton (1802–1810)==
In 1802, due to several years of low fur returns and increasingly scarce firewood, Fort Edmonton and Fort Augustus were moved upstream, to what is now the Rossdale area of downtown Edmonton. This area had been a gathering place for aboriginals in the region for thousands of years, in part due to its location along the old North Trail, AKA the Wolf&#x27;s Track.

It is possible the HBC officials on the ground might have adopted a new name for the new fort. But an 1800 directive from HBC main offices in London had instructed them to stop switching names. (Later after Fort Edmonton was moved to its third site, the head office staff instructed them to stop using the same name for differently-located forts. It is from this muddle that the present-day City of Edmonton bears the name that it does.)

The first woman of European descent known to live in this region was the French-Canadian Marie-Anne Lagimodière (née Gaboury), who was also noteworthy as the grandmother of Louis Riel. She had accompanied her fur trader husband, Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière, into the west shortly after their marriage in Trois-Rivières, Lower Canada, and was known to take part in hunting expeditions. The couple lived in Fort Augustus from 1807 to 1811.

John Rowand, the Chief Factor at Fort Edmonton from 1823 to 1854, first worked at Fort Augustus from 1804 to 1806; he was stationed there again from 1808 onward.

Evidence of this Fort Edmonton was found in 2012, when crews were excavating under a demolished machine shop at the Rossdale Power Plant.

==Third Fort Edmonton (1810–1812) ==

Both Fort Augustus and Fort Edmonton moved to the mouth of White Earth Creek, 100 km northeast of modern Edmonton at the northernmost point of the North Saskatchewan near present-day Smoky Lake, Alberta. The fort was also known as Fort White Earth, or Terre Blanche. This is located in Township 58-16-W4.

While the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North West Company still operated separate posts, in direct competition with each other, the two posts were built inside a shared palisade.

This post was only in operation for two years because Cree trappers were selling their furs at other posts to avoid violent confrontations with the Blackfoot, yet the generally more southerly Blackfoot refused to travel so far off of their normal circles and consequently took their trade south to American furtrading posts.

After its abandonment in 1812, the forts fell into ruin and little remains of them. There is no official signage on the site. Perhaps a local name for a creek that enters the Saskatchewan on the south side of the river opposite the site commemorates the old forts - its name is Fort Creek.

==Fourth Fort Edmonton (1812–1830) ==
Fort Edmonton and Fort Augustus moved back to the second site at the Rossdale flats, it having proven to be a site more amenable for Natives to visit. This was the start of recorded permanent human occupancy in the present city of Edmonton.

A crew of workers was sent from Fort Edmonton at White Earth to begin construction of a new post at the Rossdale location on October 6, 1812. Post Factor James Bird marked out the layout of the new post on October 10. James Bird&#x27;s son William Bird was born at Fort Edmonton and later played a role in the naming of today&#x27;s Mill Creek. 

In the years immediately succeeding that move, the two furtrading companies, the HBC and the NWC, had a strong and violent rivalry, peaking with the Battle of Seven Oaks at Winnipeg.

Violence broke out at Edmonton in 1826 when fort staff fought off an attempt by several Nakoda to steal some of the fort&#x27;s horses. Six Nakoda were killed and five Bay men wounded in a brisk exchange of gunfire and arrow-flight. Already by that time, horses were being kept at Horse Hill in what is now northeast Edmonton.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company merged in 1821. After the amalgamation, the companies used the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company name. The name Fort Augustus was dropped, and John Rowand, the former NWC factor, became chief trader of the HBC&#x27;s Fort Edmonton. Fort Edmonton became the headquarters for the Saskatchewan District of Rupert&#x27;s Land, which stretched from the Canadian Rocky Mountains in the west to Fort Carlton in the east; from the 49th parallel in the south to Lesser Slave Lake in the north. In 1823, Rowand was promoted to chief factor. Rowand managed Saskatchewan District from Fort Edmonton until his death in 1854.

==Fifth Fort Edmonton (1830–1915)==
Due to floods in the late 1820s, a new fort was built on the terrace above the riverflats in 1830. This fifth and final fort stood for 85 years, though its use as a fur trading post was phased out starting in 1891. During its final years, the Fort co-existed with the Alberta Legislature Building. The Legislative Building opened in 1913 on a terrace just north of the fort on the site of &quot;Rowand&#x27;s Folly&quot;, the large house built for Chief Factor John Rowand...
===Rowand&#x27;s administration===

At this time, a long-serving member of the HBC, John Edward Harriott, became the chief trader under Rowand. The two gained family ties when Harriott married one of Rowand&#x27;s daughters. On a couple of occasions when Rowand joined HBC Inland Governor George Simpson for travel abroad, Harriott acted as chief factor.

Rowand&#x27;s administration from the 1830s onward coincided with a great change in the Saskatchewan District. For the first time, missionaries, artists, and curious travellers came to Edmonton to visit, sometimes for extended periods. This frustrated Rowand to some degree. Prior to this time, the only Europeans to come that far into the west were men on some sort of company business.

With Rowand making Edmonton his home, the fort became an important centre in the west. It was a necessity for any traveller going any further west of Edmonton to go through there for provisions first. Rowand constructed a three-storey house in the heart of the fort for the exclusive use of him and his family, denoting his station to his subordinates, visitors and trade partners alike. This was nicknamed &quot;Rowand&#x27;s Folly.&quot;

====Influx of missionaries====

Two Catholic missionaries, Francois-Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers, were the first to visit Fort Edmonton (called &quot;Fort-des-Prairies&quot;) in 1838. Starting in 1840, the Fort housed the Wesleyan missionary Robert Rundle as a company chaplain. Rundle&#x27;s tenure lasted until 1848, and his ministry and missionary work was met with competition of a sort by Jean-Baptiste Thibault, a Catholic priest who, like Rundle, was attempting to evangelize natives in the area. A chapel was erected inside the fort in 1843, which the Reverend Rundle boasted could host &quot;(one) hundred Indians&quot;; the structure also had two small rooms for Rundle&#x27;s private use. Meanwhile, Rowand complained that the presence of ministers in his fort was a distraction for the natives, and was ostensibly impeding the fur trade business. On a personal level, however, Rowand had taken a liking to Rundle, and entrusted the minister with teaching his children.

Father Pierre-Jean De Smet spent the winter of 1845-46 at Fort Edmonton having traveled and explored from Oregon Country to meet the natives of the Rocky Mountains.

In 1852, the Oblate missionary Albert Lacombe first visited Fort Edmonton. With Rundle having trouble controlling the department in 1848, Lacombe easily took up residence in the former Methodist chapel. Lacombe took pity on the fur trade labourers, opining that, &quot;during the summer months, [Hudson&#x27;s Bay labourers&#x27; toil] was as hard as that of the African slave.&quot;. He found little sympathy for the workers from John Rowand or the HBC clerks. The following year, Lacombe moved to Lac St. Anne, but had a new Catholic chapel constructed in the fort in 1857 (but did not dwell there); this chapel lasted nearly twenty years before being moved outside of the fort.

A Methodist follow-up to Robert Rundle, Reverend Thomas Woolsey, was dispatched to Edmonton in 1852. His arrival in the fort coincided with Lacombe&#x27;s residency in the former Methodist chapel, a discovery which distressed Woolsey. Conflicts and private frustrations with Catholic missionaries, and failures to convert Catholics to Protestantism, marked Woolsey&#x27;s twelve-year residence at the fort.

In 1854, the mission St. Joachim was officially founded in turn at Fort-des-Praires (Fort Edmonton).

====Oregon mission====

Though somewhat distant from the territory in question, Fort Edmonton, an important stop on the York Factory Express overland trade route, was peripherally involved in the Oregon Boundary Dispute. A pair of British Army lieutenants, Mervin Vavasour and Henry James Warre, were sent on a mission in the guise of eccentric gentlemen to reconnoitre the lower Columbia River valley and Puget Sound. Among other objectives, they were to determine which HBC posts could be used in a military conflict. The trip had been encouraged by Sir George Simpson Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Warre and Vavasour reported that the mountain passes were unsuitable for troop transport. Their mission took them through Fort Edmonton in the fall of 1845, and again on their way back to Montreal in 1846. They wrote: &quot;Without attempting to describe the numerous Defiles through which we passed, or the difficulty of forcing a passage through the burnt Forests, and over the high land, we may venture to assert, that Sir George Simpson&#x27;s idea of transporting troops. . . with their stores, etc. through such an extent of uncultivated Country and over such impracticable Mountains would appear to Us quite unfeasible.&quot; As with other forts he visited on this mission, Vavasour drew a plan of Edmonton.

====Other notable visitors====

The artist Paul Kane first visited the fort in 1845. He produced several works of art based upon his time there.

====Rowand&#x27;s end====

In May 1854, John Rowand died while accompanying the annual York Boat trip eastward. Accounts suggest that he tried to break up (or join) a skirmish between some of the tripmen while at Fort Pitt, and in his rage he fell suddenly dead. He was initially buried at Fort Pitt, but was later exhumed and buried in Montreal as per his last will and testament.

===Remaining years===

====Remaining administrators====

Following a few short-lived administrations in Rowand&#x27;s wake, William J. Christie was a long-lasting chief factor at Edmonton from 1858 to 1872. Christie&#x27;s protégé Richard Charles Hardisty, later a Canadian Senator, served as chief factor in Edmonton for an interim period from 1862 through 1864.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company relinquished Rupert&#x27;s Land to the Government of Canada in 1868, pursuant to the Rupert&#x27;s Land Act 1868, thus ending the HBC&#x27;s administration of the vast territory and beginning an era of settlement in the 1870s.

By the 1890s, the fort was in disrepair and largely abandoned. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company transitioned to retail stores, and business in Edmonton ran from one of those instead.

====Explorers====
In 1841 James Sinclair stopped at Fort Edmonton to receive instructions on where to cross the Rockies. With him were about 116 to 121 mostly Métis settlers from the Red River Colony, hired by the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company to settle on Fort Nisqually and Cowlitz Farm within modern Washington state.

Captain John Palliser stayed in Fort Edmonton for a time in 1858 while on his famous expedition. With the help of the factor&#x27;s wife, Palliser held a ball there.

In 1859, the 9th Earl of Southesk visited on his way to the Rocky Mountains, hoping that the fresh mountain air would improve his health. He recorded his observations in the 1874 book Saskatchewan and Rocky Mountains and also published a book on Cree syllabics in 1875.

Viscount William Milton and William Butler Cheadle came through Edmonton in 1862/3 and published accounts of their journey.

====Under threat of warfare====
The spring of 1870 saw Fort Edmonton come under the threat of violence due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, resulting from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. A group of the Blackfoot approaching the fort from the south caught some traders with wagons of goods on the south bank, in today&#x27;s Walterdale neighbourhood of Edmonton. The traders escaped by ferry but had to leave their wagons behind. The ferry was not sent back to the Blackfoot and they were not able to give chase to the fleeing traders as they were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to high spring waters. Th Blackfoot encamped nearby, plundered the wagons and harassed the fort with their muskets. The men in the fort armed themselves and prepared to fight. But the fort was not attacked in force. Chief Factor William J. Christie ordered the Bay men not to go out to attack the Blackfoot, apprehensive that to do so would invite further violence against the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.Fifteen years later, on March 19, 1885, during the North West Rebellion, the telegraph wire connecting Edmonton to the rest of the world was cut. Fearing imminent attack, many local settlers and their families took shelter within the fort&#x27;s old wooden palisade walls. No attack happened. Within a few weeks, marching and mounted troops arrived from southern Alberta and from eastern Canada by way of the CPR station at Calgary, to ensure that no local outbreak would occur. Most of the soldiers went on out to chase down Big Bear and his band.
====Dismantling====
What remained of the fifth Fort Edmonton was dismantled in October, 1915. It was seen as a crumbling eyesore next to the Alberta Legislature Building, which had been completed three years earlier. The Government of Alberta indicated at the time that it would use the old fort&#x27;s timbers to create a heritage site elsewhere in the city, but it never did. A few were saved and still possibly exist in city museums or in Rowand House, but most were said to be accidentally burned in a Boy Scout jamboree in May 1937.

== List of chief factors ==
== Legacy ==

In 1923 the suspected site of the original Forts Augustus and Edmonton at Fort Saskatchewan was declared a National Historic Site of Canada, and a plaque was placed on the site.

In 1959, the site of the fifth Fort Edmonton (Fort Edmonton V) was also made a National Historic Site and plaque was installed near the Alberta Legislature building.

Similarly the Fort Edmonton-Fort Gary Trail was also named a National Historic Site and a plaque for it was installed in Edmonton in 1996.
===Fort Edmonton Park===
In 1969, a reconstruction of the fifth Fort Edmonton began five kilometres upstream from its final site, representing it as it stood in 1846, but this time on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan River. This marked the beginning of Fort Edmonton Park, which has become one of the city&#x27;s tourist attractions. The park represents, through various historical buildings, four distinct time periods, exploring Edmonton&#x27;s development from a fur trade post in the vast Northwest, to a settled urban centre after the First World War.

Formally established in the following year, it prospered before financial pressures forced its closure in the late 1890s.

The community is the location of a major Honda automotive production plant, East Liberty Auto Plant (opened in 1989), as well as the NHTSA&#x27;s Vehicle Research and Testing Center, located at the independent proving ground Transportation Research Center.

Besides U.S. Route 33, significant roads in East Liberty include State Routes 292 and 347.

== Geography ==
East Liberty is located in southern Perry Township at 40°18&#x27;27.6&quot; North, 83°35&#x27;10.4&quot; West (40.307682, -83.586221).

<text>These tables provide a comparison of operating systems, of computer devices, as listing general and technical information for a number of widely used and currently available PC or handheld (including smartphone and tablet computer) operating systems. The article &quot;Usage share of operating systems&quot; provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes servers, mainframes and supercomputers.

Because of the large number and variety of available Linux distributions, they are all grouped under a single entry; see comparison of Linux distributions for a detailed comparison. There is also a variety of BSD and DOS operating systems, covered in comparison of BSD operating systems and comparison of DOS operating systems.

== Nomenclature ==
The nomenclature for operating systems varies among providers and sometimes within providers.
For purposes of this article the terms used are;
;kernel
:In some operating systems, the OS is split into a low level region called the kernel and higher level code that relies on the kernel. Typically the kernel implements processes but its code does not run as part of a process.
:;hybrid kernel
:;monolithic kernel
;Nucleus
:In some operating systems there is OS code permanently present in a contiguous region of memory addressable by unprivileged code; in IBM systems this is typically referred to as the nucleus. The nucleus typically contains both code that requires special privileges and code that can run in an unprivileged state. Typically some code in the nucleus runs in the context of a dispatching unit, e.g., address space, process, task, thread, while other code runs independent of any dispatching unit. In contemporary operating systems unprivileged applications cannot alter the nucleus.

License and pricing policies also vary among different systems. The tables below use the following terms:
;BSD

:BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software.
;bundled
:The fee is included in the price of the hardware
;bundled initially
:The fee is included in the price of the hardware but upgrades require an additional fee.
;GPL2
;GPL3
;Per user
:The fee depends on the maximum number of users concurrently logged on.
;MSU
:The fee depends on the resources consumed by the user
;MULC
:Measured Usage License Charges
;PSLC
:Parallel Sysplex Software Pricing

== General information ==

== Technical information ==


== Security ==

== Commands ==
For POSIX compliant (or partly compliant) systems like FreeBSD, Linux, macOS or Solaris, the basic commands are the same because they are standardized.

NOTE: Linux systems may vary by distribution which specific program, or even &#x27;command&#x27; is called, via the POSIX function. For example, if you wanted to use the DOS to give you a directory listing with one detailed file listing per line you could use (e.g. in a session configuration file).

<text>Sir Charles Clifford, 1st Baronet (1 January 1813 – 27 February 1893) was a New Zealand politician. He was the first Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, serving from 1854 to 1860.

==Early life and family==
Clifford was born in Mount Vernon, Scotforth, Lancashire, England, eldest of nine children of George Lambert Clifford (1779–1854), of Wycliffe Hall, Yorkshire (&quot;an elegant mansion with a Catholic Chapel, and beautiful leisure grounds&quot;) and of Tixall, Staffordshire, and Mary (died 1854), daughter of Walter Hill Coyney, of Weston Coyney, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The family was wealthy and well-connected; George Lambert Clifford- reckoned &quot;stately, yet kindly and gentlemanly&quot;- was paternal grandson of Hugh Clifford, 3rd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, and maternal grandson of James Aston, 5th Lord Aston of Forfar.

After attending Stonyhurst College (as his father had, being recognised as the very first pupil to enter, commemorated by a bust in his honour at the school) Clifford set out for New Zealand with his cousin William Vavasour, leaving in 1842. Arriving in the New Zealand Company settlement of Wellington, the two established a land, shipping and commissions agency with finance from their parents. They later expanded their holdings, establishing a considerable number of farming ventures. Clifford also worked in partnership with Frederick Weld, another cousin.

At the same time, he was active in the Wellington militia, attaining the rank of captain. He was in charge of Clifford&#x27;s Stockade in Johnsonville north of Wellington in the mid-1840s. He became a justice of the peace in 1844 and a magistrate in 1846.

In Wellington on 13 January 1847, Clifford married Mary Anne Hercy, third daughter of John Hercy, JP, DL of Cruchfield House, Hawthorn Hill, Berkshire. The couple went on to have five children.

== New Zealand politician ==


At the 1853 New Zealand provincial elections, Clifford was elected to the Wellington Provincial Council, representing the City of Wellington.

On 26 May 1854 when the 1st New Zealand Parliament convened, Clifford was unanimously elected Speaker (having previously been Speaker for the Wellington Provincial Council). He remains the youngest ever Speaker, having been appointed at the age of forty-one. He was Member of the New Zealand Parliament for the City of Wellington from until his retirement as its speaker in 1860.

The most challenging event to arise during Clifford&#x27;s speakership was the prorogation of Parliament by Robert Wynyard, the acting Governor. Wynyard, objecting to Parliament&#x27;s denial that it required royal assent to establish New Zealand&#x27;s self-rule, ordered Parliament to be suspended. Parliament chose to suspend its own standing orders, allowing it to leave Wynyard&#x27;s instructions officially &quot;unopened&quot; while it continued to debate. The possibility of suspending standing orders was challenged by Wynyard&#x27;s supporters, but Clifford eventually decided to allow it. Clifford also allowed the proposal and passage of a motion condemning Wynyard&#x27;s attempt prorogation.

== Retirement and later life ==
Clifford retired from Parliament in 1860, deciding to return to England. He did, however, retain a considerable interest in New Zealand&#x27;s affairs, and advised British authorities on a number of matters. In 1866, he presented the New Zealand Parliament with a ceremonial mace similar to the one used in the British House of Commons. He also retained considerable business interests in New Zealand. Clifford died in London on 27 February 1893.

== Honours ==
In 1854 on appointment as Speaker of the New Zealand House Representatives Clifford was granted the title of The Honourable. and became The Hon. Charles Clifford Esq. In 1858 Clifford was appointed as a Knight of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and became The Hon. Sir Charles Clifford. On 16 July 1887 Clifford was created a baronet, of Flaxbourne, New Zealand, and became The Hon. Sir Charles Clifford Bt., the Clifford-baronetcy still existed as of October 2012.

<doc id="981539" wikidata="Q5340874" url="?curid=981539" title="Education Act 1944">
<text>The Education Act 1944 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 6. c. 31) made major changes in the provision and governance of secondary schools in England and Wales. It is also known as the Butler Act after the President of the Board of Education, R. A. Butler. Historians consider it a &quot;triumph for progressive reform,&quot; and it became a core element of the post-war consensus supported by all major parties. The Act was repealed in steps with the last parts repealed in 1996.

==Background==
The basis of the Education Act 1944 was a memorandum entitled &quot;Education After the War&quot; (commonly referred to as the &quot;Green Book&quot;) which was compiled by Board of Education officials and distributed to selected recipients in June 1941. The President of the Board of Education at that time was Butler&#x27;s predecessor, Herwald Ramsbotham; Butler succeeded him on 20 July 1941. The Green Book formed the basis of the 1943 White Paper, &quot;Educational Reconstruction&quot; which was itself used to formulate the 1944 act. The purpose of the act was to address the country&#x27;s educational needs amid demands for social reform that had been an issue before the Second World War began. The act incorporated proposals developed by leading specialists in the 1920s and 1930s such as R. H. Tawney and William Henry Hadow. The text of the act was drafted by Board of Education officials including Griffiths G. Williams, William Cleary, H. B. Wallis, S. H. Wood, Robert S. Wood, and Maurice Holmes.

There was a desire to keep the churches involved in education but they could not afford to modernise without government help. By negotiation with the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple (1881-1944), and other religious leaders, a majority of the Anglican church schools became voluntary controlled and were effectively absorbed into the state system in return for funding. The act also encouraged non-sectarian religious teaching in secular schools. A third of the Anglican church schools became voluntary aided which entitled them to enhanced state subsidies whilst retaining autonomy over admissions, curriculum and teacher appointments; Roman Catholic schools also chose this option.

The legislation was enacted in 1944, but its changes were designed to take effect after the war, thus allowing for additional pressure groups to have their influence. Paul Addison argues that in the end, the act was widely praised by Conservatives because it honoured religion and social hierarchy, by Labour because it opened new opportunities for working class children, and by the general public because it ended the fees they had to pay for secondary education. State primary education had been free since the Education Act 1891; even after 1944 certain older grammar schools—the direct grant grammar schools—continued to charge fees but also admitted state pupils on scholarships.

==New policies==
Butler designed the act as an expression of &quot;One Nation Conservatism&quot; in the tradition attributed to Disraeli, which called for paternalism by the upper class towards the working class. Butler later wrote in his 1971 memoirs that the 1944 act, like those of 1870, 1902 and 1918, did not “sweep the board clean” but rather “established a financial framework” within which local authorities could conduct such policies as were appropriate for their region.

The name “elementary school” was abolished as implying that the poorer children who tended to attend such schools would receive an inferior education. The Act ended the traditional all-age (5–14) elementary sector, enforcing the division between primary (5–11 years old) and secondary (11–15 years old) education that many local authorities had already introduced. It abolished fees on parents for state secondary schools. It brought a more equitable funding system to localities and to different school sectors. The act renamed the Board of Education as the Ministry of Education, giving it greater powers and a bigger budget. While defining the school leaving age as 15, it granted the government the power to raise the age to 16 &quot;as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable&quot;, though the change was not implemented until 1973. It also brought in a new system for setting teacher salaries.

One of the results of the act was to increase the openness of secondary schools to girls and the working class, educating and mobilising them. Another result was that the percentage of children attending higher education tripled from 1% to 3%.

The act provided both for nursery schools and Further Education programmes through community colleges, offering education for both children and adults, a measure that was only followed through by a few LEAs such as the Cambridgeshire Village Colleges, Leicestershire Community Colleges and Coventry, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire community schools.

Anglican schools were continued, but brought under increased state funding and control. Every state-funded school was required to begin the day with a nondenominational religious prayer. This clause was amended by the Education Reform Act 1988, which specified that the act of worship should be of a &#x27;broadly Christian nature&#x27; unless such a message was deemed to be inappropriate for a particular school or group of children. The amendment also specified that the act of worship could now take place in classes, rather than the previous system of conducting worship in assemblies.

The act was supported by HORSA (Hutting Operation for the Raising of the School-Leaving Age) a building programme to provide &#x27;hut&#x27;-style accommodation to meet the additional educational demand.

== School meals and milk==

The Education Act 1944 made it a duty of local education authorities to provide school meals and milk. The authority could remit the charge for the meal in cases of hardship. The Provision of Free Milk Regulations 1946 (SR&amp;O 1946/1293), made under section 49 of the 1944 act, provided free school milk to all children under 18 in maintained schools from August 1946.

In 1968 Edward Short, the Labour Secretary of State for Education and Science, withdrew free milk from secondary schools for children over eleven. His successor, Conservative Margaret Thatcher withdrew free school milk from children over seven in 1971, earning her the nickname &quot;Thatcher, the Milk Snatcher&quot;. In the April 1978 budget, the Labour Government was able to use an EEC subsidy on milk to restore free school milk to children aged between 7 and 11.

<text>The Astoria–Megler Bridge is a steel cantilever through-truss bridge in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States that spans the lower Columbia River. It carries a section of U.S. Route 101 from Astoria, Oregon, to Point Ellice near Megler, Washington. Opened in 1966, it is the longest continuous truss bridge in North America.

The bridge is from the mouth of the river at the Pacific Ocean. The bridge is in length, and was the final segment of U.S. Route 101 to be completed between Olympia, Washington, and Los Angeles, California.

==History==
Ferry service between Astoria and the Washington side of the Columbia River began in 1926. The Oregon Department of Transportation purchased the ferry service in 1946. This ferry service did not operate during inclement weather and the half-hour travel time caused delays. In order to allow faster and more reliable crossings near the mouth of the river, a bridge was planned. The bridge was built jointly by the Oregon Department of Transportation and Washington State Department of Transportation. Following construction, the Oregon Department of Transportation became the lead agency responsible for maintenance and operating the structure.

Construction on the structure began on November 5, 1962, and the concrete piers were cast at Tongue Point, upriver. The steel structure was built in segments at Vancouver, Washington, upriver, then barged downstream where hydraulic jacks lifted them into place. The bridge opened to traffic on July 29, 1966, marking the completion of U.S. Route 101 and becoming the seventh major bridge built by Oregon in the 1950s–1960s; ferry service ended the night before. On August 27, 1966, Governors Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Dan Evans of Washington dedicated the bridge by cutting a ceremonial ribbon. The four-day ceremony was celebrated by 30,000 attendees who participated in parades, drives, and a marathon boat race from Portland to Astoria. The cost of the project was $24 million, equivalent to $ million in dollars, and was paid for by tolls that were removed on December 24, 1993, more than two years early.

==Details==

The bridge is in length and carries one lane of traffic in each direction. The cantilever-span section, which is closest to the Oregon side, is long, and its main (central) span measures . It was built to withstand wind gusts and river water speeds of . As of 2004, an average of 7,100 vehicles per day used the Astoria–Megler Bridge. Designed by William Adair Bugge construction of the cantilever truss bridge was completed by the DeLong Corporation, the American Bridge Company, and Pomeroy Gerwick.

The south end has the former toll plaza, at the end of a inclined ramp which forms a spiral bridge, going through a full 360-degree loop while gaining elevation over land to provide almost of clearance over the shipping channel (similarly to the Lincoln Tunnel Helix in Weehawken, New Jersey). The north end is an at-grade intersection with State Route 401. Since most of the northern portion of the bridge is over shallow, non-navigable water, it is low to the water.

Repainting the bridge was planned for May 2009 through 2011 and budgeted at $20 million, to be shared by the states of Oregon and Washington. A four-year planned paint stripping and repainting project was planned for March 2012 through December 2016.

In 2016, a colony of double-crested cormorants moved from nearby East Sand Island to the bridge, where they began nesting. Their presence caused issues with bridge inspections, as bird droppings and guano covered visual cracks, and nests obscured navigational lights used by ship traffic. The population of cormorants increased to 5,000 breeding pairs in 2020, prompting efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to scare the birds from the bridge and relocate them back to East Sand Island.

==Pedestrians==
Normally, only motor vehicles and bicycles are allowed on the bridge—not pedestrians. There is no sidewalk and the shoulders are too narrow for pedestrians adjacent to traffic. However, one day a year—usually in October—the bridge is host to the Great Columbia Crossing. Participants are taken by shuttle to the Washington side, from where they run or walk to the Oregon side on a route across the bridge. Motor traffic is allowed to use only one lane (of two lanes) and is advised to expect delays during the two-hour event. For the first time, during the 2018 event, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced that the bridge would be closed to motor traffic.

==Popular culture==
The bridge itself is featured prominently in the movies &quot;Short Circuit&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes I Think About Dying&quot;. It stands in for the doomed fictional Madison Bridge in Irwin Allen&#x27;s 1979 made-for-TV disaster movie &quot;The Night the Bridge Fell Down&quot;. Songwriter Sufjan Stevens most likely references the bridge in his song &quot;Should Have Known Better&quot; off his 2015 album &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot; as a metaphor for dealing with his grief from the death of his mother.

<doc id="981551" wikidata="Q497444" url="?curid=981551" title="Digital Audio Stationary Head">
<text>The Digital Audio Stationary Head or DASH standard is a reel-to-reel, digital audio tape format introduced by Sony in early 1982 for high-quality multitrack studio recording and mastering, as an alternative to analog recording methods. DASH is capable of recording two channels of audio on a quarter-inch tape, and 24 or 48 tracks on tape on open reels of up to 14 inches. The data is recorded on the tape linearly, with a stationary recording head, as opposed to the DAT format, where data is recorded helically with a rotating head, in the same manner as a VCR. The audio data is encoded as linear PCM and boasts strong cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error correction, allowing the tape to be physically edited with a razor blade as analog tape would, e.g. by cutting and splicing, and played back with no loss of signal. In a two-track DASH recorder, the digital data is recorded onto the tape across nine data tracks: eight for the digital audio data and one for the CRC data; there is also provision for two linear analog cue tracks and one additional linear analog track dedicated to recording time code.

Digital audio recorders are fundamentally high bit-rate data recorders storing PCM encoded audio data. The main advantage of any digital recording medium is that of consistent, flat frequency response, high dynamic range audio reproduction compared to analog tape recorders, which is why some of the first uses of digital audio recording were for classical music. To further increase usable dynamic range, early DASH recorders included a specialized circuit called &quot;Emphasis&quot; which was intended to help overcome the noise of analog to digital and digital to analog converters of the time by boosting high frequencies on the front end. This circuit required complimentary de-emphasis on playback after the DAC for accurate reproduction. While emphasis was almost a necessity in earlier units, the circuit, of course, had a sound of its own and was used less and less as converter design improved.

There were three families of DASH recorders produced by Sony and Studer, with few differences among them:

*2 track: PCM-3402, PCM-3202, Studer D820x
*24 track: PCM-3324, PCM-3324A, PCM-3324S
*48 track: PCM-3348, PCM-3348HR, and the Studer D820 and D827
*TASCAM also produced a 24-track DASH recorder, the DA-800/24.

With the exception of the Sony PCM-3348HR and Studer D827, all of the DASH recorders have 16-bit resolution with a 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz sampling rate, although it is possible to use an outboard analog-to-digital converter of up to 20-bit resolution. The PCM-3348HR and D827 are capable of 24-bit 48 kHz operation at 45 ips, and are the only machines that still find significant use today, often in only the highest-end studios for music and film production. All DASH recorders primarily use the SDIF-2 (Sony Digital Interface Format-2) as a digital interface, which is slightly different from the S/PDIF or AES3 that nearly all other digital audio recorders use, but is technically superior because SDIF-2&#x27;s word clock is not multiplexed into the bitstream.

Because SDIF-2 is often only found on the expensive DASH recorders, it is also often only found on the highest-end mixing consoles, such as those made by Solid State Logic.

==Tape==
One significant advantage offered by DASH recorders over the analog recorders of the day was that &#x27;proper&#x27; tape biasing was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to &#x27;color&#x27; the sound of the recorded data. This was a nice advantage, and routine maintenance amounted to not much more than keeping the tape guides clean. Due to this fact, the formulation of tape does not change the sound quality, unlike analog machines which must be set for specific formulae.

The 2-track DASH machines use 1/4&quot; wide tape, while the 24 and 48 track versions use 1/2&quot; wide tape. One interesting thing of note is that the 24-track machines only utilize half of the tape&#x27;s width, and can be played on the 48-track machines with no modifications. Similarly, the 48-track tapes can be played on a 24-track machine, but only the first 24 tracks are capable of being reproduced.

DASH recorders (as well as any other type of digital recorder using magnetic tape) require the use of metal-particle formulation magnetic tape. Some examples of metal particle tape compatible with DASH machines are 3M Scotch 275, Ampex / Quantegy 467, EMTEC 931, and Sony&#x27;s own tape formulation. These tape formulations are not directly compatible with any analog open-reel tape recorder.

The DASH format is not compatible with the only other popular open reel stationary head digital recording format, Mitsubishi&#x27;s ProDigi, which was available as 2-, 16-, and 32-track variations.

<text>At the 1952 Winter Olympics, three figure skating events were contested. Compulsory figures were skated at the outdoor Jordal Amfi rink, while the free skating portions of the competition were held at the huge Bislett Stadium, on a regulation-sized ice surface set inside the speed skating track. The competition opened with the ladies&#x27; figures on 16 and 17 February, followed by the men&#x27;s figures on 19 February and then the three free skating events for ladies, men, and pairs. Somewhat unusually for competitions of this era, there were no particular problems with bad weather or poor ice conditions at the outdoor rinks. At this competition, Dick Button won his second Olympic title, and also became the first skater to land a triple jump—a triple loop jump—in competition.

<text>Sir David Rolland Spedding (7 March 1943 – 13 June 2001) was head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1994 to 1999.

==Early life==
David Spedding was the son of a Border Regiment lieutenant colonel, and grew up in the middle class. He was initially educated at Sherborne School, then read history at Hertford College, Oxford.

==Career==
Spedding joined the Secret Intelligence Service in 1967, while a postgraduate student at Oxford. He then attended the Middle East Center for Arabic Studies in Beirut, becoming a specialist on Middle East affairs. He also served in Santiago and Abu Dhabi.

In 1971 Spedding was named as the local SIS station commander in Lebanon, and was later posted to Abu Dhabi in 1977. Following his Middle East Directorate appointment in 1983, he was made the Amman Jordan station head, and was subsequently commended in that position for uncovering an Abu Nidal plan to assassinate the Queen during an upcoming Jordan visit. For this he was made Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

In 1993, Spedding became Director of Requirements and Operations. In 1994 he became Chief of the Service, becoming the first chief to have never served in the armed forces, and the youngest to have held the position to that date. During his tenure the SIS faced some degree of negative publicity due to unauthorized disclosures in the wake of Richard Tomlinson&#x27;s dismissal.

Spedding died of lung cancer on 13 June 2001, aged 58.

<text>Sir George Murray (6 February 1772 – 28 July 1846) was a British soldier and politician from Scotland.

==Background and education==
Murray was born in Ochtertyre, near Crieff in Perthshire, the second son of Sir William Murray, of Ochtertyre, 5th Baronet (see Murray Baronets), and was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh. His mother was Lady Augusta Mackenzie, youngest daughter of the Jacobite George, 3rd Earl of Cromartie. His elder brother was Sir Patrick Murray, 6th Baronet.

An army surgeon, who knew Murray in Dublin in 1825 described his appearance as &quot;&#x27;never saw a finer face than his. Indeed, such a pleasing and happy combination of intelligence, sweetness and spirit, with regularity, beauty and a noble cast of features, is rarely to be found in human physiognomies.&quot;&#x27;

==Military career==
In 1789, Murray obtained a commission into the 71st Foot, reaching the rank of captain in 1794, and saw service in Flanders (1794–95), the West Indies, England and Ireland. In 1799, he was made a lieutenant-colonel, entering the Quartermaster General&#x27;s Department and making his considerable reputation as Quartermaster General (1808–11) during the Peninsular War, under the Duke of Wellington, and receiving promotion to Colonel in 1809. After a brief period as Quartermaster General in Ireland, Murray returned to the Peninsular Campaign as Major-General (1813–14), and was invested with the Order of the Bath in 1813. During the Peninsular War he was present at the battles of A Coruña, Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes de Oñoro, Vittoria, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. His Peninsular Gold Medal had six clasps – only the Duke of Wellington, with nine clasps, Sir Dennis Pack and Lord Beresford, with seven each, had more clasps to their medal.

He was briefly in Canada from December 1814 to May 1815 where he was appointed provisional Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada and reviewed the country&#x27;s defences. He quickly returned to Europe following Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba, but arrived too late to take part in the Battle of Waterloo.

After the cessation of hostilities, Murray was based in France as Chief of Staff to the Army of Occupation and, thereafter, he was appointed Governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1819. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford in 1820 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824. In 1825, he married Lady Louisa Erskine, widow of Sir James Erskine of Torrie (1772–1825). Subsequently, he was made Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance and then Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, but in 1828 he resigned the position and became Colonial Secretary. He was later Master-General of the Ordnance from 1834 to 1835 and again between 1841 and 1846.

==Political career==
Murray was a Tory and later Conservative in politics. He was Member of Parliament for Perthshire from 1824 to 1832 and from 1834 until he retired in 1835. He served as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1828 to 1830. He also contested Westminster in 1837 and Manchester in both 1839 and 1841, without success.

==Other public appointments==
Murray was also President of the Royal Geographical Society (1833–35) and Governor of Edinburgh Castle. On 7 September 1829 he was appointed Governor of Fort George.

==Personal life==

Murray was married to Lady Louisa Erskine (née Paget) (1777–1842) in 1825, widow of Lieutenant General Sir James Erskine (1772–1825), and sister of his fellow general, Henry, Lord Anglesey after much scandals; which resulted in the couple having one illegitimate daughter born in 1822 when Lady Louisa was still married to Sir James, the daughter was named Louise Georgina (1822-1891).

Murray later brought his daughter to be presented in 1830 and it was reported that the new Queen Adelaide, was ‘very rude to Murray and his daughter, who said afterwards that it was very painful but necessary’. Louise married Lieutenant Henry Boyce of the 2nd Life Guards on 14 Sep 1843, but he died in 1848 and she lived childless, until she died at Bordighera on 25 Feb 1891.

Murray died in July 1846, aged 74, at his house in 5 Belgrave Square and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His substantial papers and maps were given to the National Library of Scotland by a great-niece in 1913.

==Legacy==
The Memorials to Governors in the Chapel of the present-day Royal Military Academy Sandhurst include:
&quot;In Memory of General the Right Hon. Sir George Murray, G.C.B., G.C H., Colonel 1st Royal Regiment of Foot. Died 28 July 1846, aged 74. He served in Holland, Egypt, Syria, the West Indies, Denmark, and Sweden ; wsLS Q.M.G. in the Peninsula; Commander-in-Chief in Canada; Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation in France ; Commander of the Forces in Ireland, and twice Master-General of the Ordnance. He was Governor of this College from 1819 to 1824.&quot;

The Murray River and Mount Murray in eastern Australia, the Murray River and Murray County in Western Australia, were named after him. Places in Hong Kong named after him include: Murray House, one of the oldest surviving public buildings in Hong Kong, Murray Building, Murray Road and the former Murray Barracks. The city of Perth, Western Australia was named in his honour after his parliamentary constituency Perthshire.

<doc id="981575" wikidata="Q3501010" url="?curid=981575" title="Recording head">
<text>A recording head is the physical interface between a recording apparatus and a moving recording medium. Recording heads are generally classified according to the physical principle that allows them to impress their data upon their medium. A recording head is often mechanically paired with a playback head, which, though proximal to, is often discrete from the record head.

==Types==
The two most common forms of recording head are:
* Magnetic - Magnetic recording heads use the principles of electromagnetism to coerce a paramagnetic recording medium, such as iron oxides, to orient in a magnetic storage medium such as magnetic tape, floppy disk or hard disk. Record heads are constructed of laminated permalloy, ferrite, sendust or magnetoresistive materials. Tape heads and hard disk drive heads are today generally some form of magnetoresistive head

* Optical - Optical recording heads use the principles of optics and light to impart energy on a recording medium, which accepts the energy in a readable manner, e.g. by melting or photography. Note that Magneto-optical recording, though using optics and heat, should properly be considered a magnetic process, since the data stored on magneto-optical media is stored magnetically.

Earlier systems, such as phonograph records, used mechanical heads known as styli to physically cut grooves in the recording medium, in a configuration (of size, width, depth and position) recoverable as sound.

<doc id="981577" wikidata="Q11801923" url="?curid=981577" title="Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham">
<text>Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham ( 1260 – 25 August 1339) lord of the manor of Cobham, Kent and of Cooling, also in Kent, was an English peer.

==Origins==

He was the son and heir of John de Cobham (d. 1300), of Cobham and of Cooling, Sheriff of Kent, Constable of Rochester Castle in Kent and one of the Barons of the Exchequer, by his wife Joan de Septvans (d. 1298), whose monumental brass survives in Cobham Church, a daughter and co-heiress of Sir Robert de Septvans of Chartham in Kent.

His uncle was Sir Henry de Cobham (d. c. 1316), of Rundale, Kent, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, who by his wife Joan Pencester (bef. 1269 – 1314/15) (a daughter of Stephen de Pencester), was the father of Stephen de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham &quot;of Rundale&quot; and of John de Cobham (d. c. 1314), the latter who died childless.

The Cobham coat of arms was: &quot;Gules, on a chevron or three lions rampant sable&quot;, as visible on the top two shields on the brass in Cobham Church of Joan Septvans (d.1298), wife of John de Cobham (d. 1300) and mother of Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham.

===Brass of mother===
A monumental brass, laid down in 1320, survives in St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church, Cobham, of Joan Septvans (d. 1298), wife of John de Cobham (d. 1300) and mother of Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham. It displays one of the earliest-known specimens of a Gothic canopy. The inscription, in Longobardic letters and Leonine verse is as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
:::
:::
&lt;/poem&gt;
(&quot;Dame Jone de Cobham lies here, may God have mercy on her soul. Whosoever shall pray for her soul shall have forty days of pardon&quot;). Concerning the famous Cobham brasses, William Belcher, in his &quot;Kentish Brasses&quot; (1905), stated: &quot;Kent is peculiarly rich in Brasses. It has, perhaps, a larger number and a more representative collection than any other county, although individually finer examples may be found elsewhere. No church in the world possesses such a splendid series as the nineteen brasses in Cobham Church, ranging in date between 1298 and 1529&quot;. Thirteen of the brasses belong to the years 1320–1529 and commemorate members of the Cobham family and of the Brooke family, their heirs.

==Career==

He was made Constable of Rochester Castle for life in 1303/4, of Dover Castle, of Tonbridge Castle in 1324 and of Canterbury, all in Kent. He was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1307 and between 1315 and 1320 and he served thrice as Sheriff of Kent (1300–1301, 1307 and 1315).

On 8 January 1312/13 he was created Baron Cobham &quot;of Kent&quot; (to distinguish his title from that of his first cousin Baron Cobham &quot;of Rundale&quot;) by writ. He presided at the arraignment of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere for treason at Canterbury in 1322.

== Marriage and issue ==
At sometime before July 1285, he married Maud de Moreville, widow of Matthew de Columbers (d. pre-1284) (whom she had married before 1284), and a daughter of Eudes de Moreville. By his wife he had issue including:
*John de Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham (d. 1355), son and heir.

==Death and burial==
He died at Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, the seat of the Beauchamp family&#x27;s feudal barony of Hatch Beauchamp, and was buried in the Beauchamp Chapel at Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset. He left a highly illustrated book called an &quot;Apocalypse to Juliana Leybourne&quot;.

<doc id="981578" wikidata="Q5273546" url="?curid=981578" title="Dick White">
<text>Sir Dick Goldsmith White, (20 December 1906 – 21 February 1993) was a British intelligence officer. He was Director General (DG) of MI5 from 1953 to 1956, and Head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1956 to 1968.

==Early life==
White was born in Tonbridge, Kent, the son of an ironmonger Percy Hall White and Gertrude Farthing and went to school at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College. He took a First Class Degree in History at Christ Church, Oxford in 1927, and learnt to speak German. He was athletic in his youth and obtained a blue in running at Oxford. He was described by Peter Wright as resembling David Niven: &quot;the same perfect English manners, easy charm, and immaculate dress sense.&quot; He was, said Wright, &quot;tall with lean, healthy features and a sharp eye&quot;.

He would qualify for a Commonwealth Fellowship in 1928 which saw him seek further education in the United States at the Universities of Michigan and California. After returning to the UK, he failed to obtain a position at Christ Church, Oxford and after being rejected by the navy, he obtained work in Croydon as a teacher. He was spotted by a recruiter in 1935 while on Mediterranean cruise with his students and invited to an interview with Guy Liddell at MI5.

==Career==
He was employed at MI5 in 1936 to monitor the rise of Nazism in Germany and spent a year in Munich attempting to recruit Germans. When back from Germany, he worked with Jona Ustinov to identify potential recruits. He was a co-creator of the Double-Cross system in 1940, to turn Abwehr agents in the UK and elsewhere. He would eventually become Liddell&#x27;s assistant director in B Division. By 1943, he was seconded to SHAEF as a special advisor on counter-intelligence ending the war as a brigadier. He was sent to Berlin at the end of the war to investigate Hitler&#x27;s fate.

He returned to MI5 in 1947 as head of its counter-intelligence division. In 1949, he was warned by the FBI of a Soviet spy at Harwell, the UK&#x27;s Atomic Energy Research Establishment. Investigation identified Klaus Fuchs who was later interrogated and confessed to being a spy for the Soviets. White and MI5 were still in denial of the state of the Soviet penetration until the FBI discovered a spy via the Venona project called &quot;Homer&quot; working in British government. Kim Philby would warn the KGB in 1951, that Donald Maclean, now in the UK, had been identified as &quot;Homer&quot; and Guy Burgess was sent to warn him. White attempted to track the latter two to France but they had escaped. Their arrival in Moscow compromised Philby&#x27;s position. Under a cloud of suspicion raised by his highly visible and intimate association with Burgess, Philby returned to London. There, he underwent MI5 interrogation by White aimed at ascertaining whether he had acted as a &quot;third man&quot; in Burgess and Maclean&#x27;s spy ring. In July 1951, Philby resigned from MI6, preempting his all-but-inevitable dismissal. Philby was cleared a few years later by Harold Macmillan.

By 1953, White was appointed as director-general of MI5 and in 1956 was appointed Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 1956 in the wake of the &quot;Crabb Affair&quot;, the exposure of which had damaged Soviet-British relations and embarrassed MI6 and clashed with Anthony Eden and Macmillan over their handling of the Suez Crisis. Much as Peter Wright liked White, he felt his move to MI6 was a mistake for both MI5 and MI6: &quot;Just as his work [at MI5] was beginning, he was moved on a politician&#x27;s whim to an organisation he knew little about, and which was profoundly hostile to his arrival. He was never to be as successful there as he had been in MI5.&quot; During his tenure at MI6, he rebuilt the organisation&#x27;s relationship with Whitehall and the CIA. This was especially true when MI6 recruited Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU Colonel that led to the identification of MI6 officer George Blake in 1963 as Soviet spy.

White had always suspected Kim Philby of being the &quot;third man&quot;. When he found out that Philby had been employed as freelance MI6 agent in Beirut, he sent Nicholas Elliott to interrogate Philby and encourage him to return to London. Philby fled to Moscow. By 1964, he was aware of the &quot;Fourth Man&quot; when Anthony Blunt confessed his knowledge of the other three spies for immunity.

At the time, the identity of all MI5 and MI6 personnel was kept secret; officially, the government did not even admit to their existence. White&#x27;s role as head of MI6 came out in 1967, when he was identified by the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine. White would retire in 1968 and became the Cabinet Office&#x27;s first Intelligence Co-ordinator before retiring for good in 1972.

==Marriage==
In 1945, he married Kathleen Bellamy and they had four children, Adrian, Frances, Jenny and Stephen.

==Honours==
Honoured many times throughout his career, he was given an OBE in 1942, a CBE in 1950, a KBE in 1955, and finally a KCMG in 1960. Other honours include a Legion of Merit and a Croix de Guerre.

==Death==
After a long illness he died from intestinal cancer at his home, &quot;The Leat&quot; in Burpham, near Arundel in Sussex, on 21 February 1993; his wife, Kathleen, survived him.

<doc id="981584" wikidata="Q4978550" url="?curid=981584" title="Bruces sketch">
<text>The Bruces sketch is a comedy sketch that originally appeared in a 1970 episode of the television show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, episode 22, &quot;How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body&quot;, and was subsequently performed on audio recordings and live on many occasions by the Monty Python team.

In reference to the sketch, Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson used the stage name &quot;Bruce Bruce&quot; while a member of the British hard rock band Samson.

==Description==

The sketch involves four stereotypical &quot;ocker&quot; Australians of the period, who are all wearing khakis and cork hats. All are named Bruce, hence being known as &quot;the Bruces&quot;.

The skit begins with a shot of a man’s kneecap, labelled (as part of the episode’s theme, &quot;How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body&quot;). The camera zooms out to reveal it as belonging to an Australian man named Bruce (Eric Idle), who is seated with two other men, also named Bruce (Graham Chapman and Michael Palin). Their boss, a fourth Bruce (John Cleese) arrives with a new staff member, a &quot;pommie&quot; (Englishman) named Michael Baldwin (Terry Jones). The setting turns out to be a meeting of the Philosophy Department of the University of Woolamaloo. Because Baldwin&#x27;s first name is different from everyone else&#x27;s, he is asked if he minds being called &quot;Bruce&quot; to avoid confusion.

The department appears to be situated in nothing more than a simple wooden building somewhere near Uluru/Ayers Rock (which is visible in the distance behind them) in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory.

The Bruces share a fondness for lager beer and a dislike of &quot;&quot; (a derogatory Australian and English slang word for a homosexual). Cleese&#x27;s character (who in a later sketch is called Bruce Beer) recites the seven faculty rules of the University of Woolamaloo:

# No poofters.
# No member of the faculty is to maltreat the &quot;Abos&quot; in any way whatsoever—if there&#x27;s anyone watching.
# No poofters.
# I don&#x27;t want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out.
# No poofters.
# There is no rule six.
# No poofters.

The meeting contains various prayers recited by the Bruces, including: &quot;Oh Lord, we beseech thee. Amen.&quot;, &quot;Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia, we love you. Amen.&quot;, and &quot;This here&#x27;s the wattle, the emblem of our land. You can stick it in a bottle or you can hold it in your hand. Amen.&quot;

After an Aboriginal servant hands over some steaks, the first Bruce notices something, exclaims, &quot;Sidney Nolan! What’s that?!&quot;, and points at Baldwin’s ear, which is identified as the next part of the body.

==Versions==
The sketch appeared on the &quot;Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; album and in many of the team&#x27;s stage shows, where it would be capped with a performance of &quot;Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song&quot;. Free cans of Foster&#x27;s beer were tossed to the audience with the addition of a joke about American beer given at &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;.

A slightly different version of the sketch is recorded on &quot;Monty Python Live at Drury Lane&quot;. The identity of &quot;Bruce&quot; is Lauchlan Chipman, Professor of Philosophy and friend of Michael Palin. Chipman was the founding Chairman of the Philosophy Department at the University of Wollongong.

==Development==
Eric Idle co-wrote the sketch with Cleese and said he based it on his Australian friends from the 1960s &quot;who always seemed to be called Bruce&quot;. Australian film director Bruce Beresford was friends with Idle while Idle was living in Notting Hill.

The fictional University of Woolamaloo is either a misspelling of or a name derived from the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo, which is pronounced &quot;Woolamaloo&quot; with an Australian accent.

<doc id="981589" wikidata="Q7787441" url="?curid=981589" title="Thomas Bartley (politician)">
<text>Thomas Houghton Bartley JP (1798 – 25 December 1878) was an English born New Zealand politician.

== Biography ==
Bartley was born in 1798 in Liverpool. Like his brother William, he was a lawyer. In 1838, both of them were in Adelaide. William Bartley stayed in that city and became attorney for the South Australian Company, but Thomas Bartley went to New Zealand in 1839 and settled in the Bay of Islands. In 1841, he moved to Auckland, where he worked as a solicitor.

== Politics ==
He represented the City of Auckland electorate on the first and second council of the Auckland Province (20 July 1853 – 15 July 1854; 26 October 1855 – 18 August 1857). He was the first Deputy-Superintendent of Auckland Province (18 September 1856 – 11 November 1856) and the first Speaker of the Province (1853–1857). As Speaker, he was succeeded by William Powditch.

Bartley served in the First New Zealand Parliament, representing the City of Auckland electorate. He was elected on 11 August 1853 and resigned on 11 July 1854. He was a member of the Fitzgerald Ministry, led by James FitzGerald, from 11 July 1854 to 2 August 1854.

Bartley resigned from the House of Representatives on 11 August 1854 to take up a position in the Legislative Council, where he served as Speaker from 12 May 1856 to 1 July 1868. His membership of the Legislative Council lapsed on 3 July 1874 due to non-attendance.

Bartley was appointed a justice of the peace in 1856. He died on 25 December 1878 at his home in Stokes&#x27; Point (these days, the locality is the northern landing of the Auckland Harbour Bridge). He is buried in Parnell, Auckland.

<doc id="981594" wikidata="Q505455" url="?curid=981594" title="Jovanotti">
<text>Lorenzo Cherubini (; born 27 September 1966), better known as Jovanotti (), is an Italian singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and DJ.

The name Jovanotti derives from &quot;giovanotti&quot;, the plural form of the Italian word &quot;giovanotto&quot; (&quot;young man&quot;). Cherubini initially chose &quot;Joe Vanotti&quot; as his stage name, but a promotional poster for a night club incorrectly billed him as &quot;Jovanotti&quot; and the name stuck. The spelling &quot;Jovanotti&quot; is anglicized; the letter J is rarely used in Italian. Jovanotti is commonly known to his fans by the diminutive form &quot;Jova&quot;, and often refers to himself that way in promotional items and on his Web TV channel Jova.TV, which launched 2 October 2014.

Jovanotti gradually departed from his early mix of hip hop, rap and disco, taking in funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so did his lyrics too, which over time began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian &quot;cantautore&quot; tradition. His social and political commitment increased as well. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop.

Most of his songs are sung in Italian; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;. Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;. Jovanotti also appeared in one of Luciano Pavarotti&#x27;s charity concerts in 1996.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Cherubini was born on 27 September 1966 in Rome to Tuscan parents, Mario and Viola Cardinali, but he spent part of his childhood in his parents&#x27; hometown, Cortona, in the province of Arezzo (Tuscany).

After completing his high-school studies, he started working as a disc jockey in several discothèques and radio stations in the province of Rome. 
In 1985 he moved to Milan. Two years later, during the summer of 1987, while he was playing a DJ set in Palinuro, he met the record producer and talent scout Claudio Cecchetto, who proposed they begin working together. That same year Jovanotti released his first single, &quot;Walking,&quot; and started working as a DJ for one of the most prominent national radio stations, Radio DeeJay, which was founded by Cecchetto five years earlier.

=== Career ===

His first studio album, &quot;Jovanotti for President&quot;, was released in 1988 and became the symbol of the Italian youth of the eighties, without any interest in ideologies and politics. Despite receiving strongly negative criticism, the album became a big commercial success, reaching the third position on the Italian &quot;Musica e dischi&quot; Albums Chart and selling over 400,000 copies in Italy. Moreover, the album spawned five singles, including the number-one hits, &quot;Gimme Five&quot; (also the name of his British TV show for Janet Street Porter&#x27;s DEF II youth TV block on BBC Two) and &quot;Gimme Five (Rasta Five)&quot; and the songs &quot;Go Jovanotti Go&quot; and &quot;Mix, Remix &amp; The singers,&quot; which entered the Italian top 5.

In 1998, Jovanotti played a brief role in the movie I Giardini dell&#x27;Eden, directed by Alessandro D&#x27;Alatri.

The song &quot;Piove&quot; was released for the second season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as an ending credits track.

His 2005 CD, &quot;Buon Sangue&quot;, was influenced by both rock and old school hip hop. It is one of his most innovative works to date. Edoardo Bennato collaborated on one track, while bass player Saturnino co-wrote two of the songs.

In 2007 he was featured at the end of Negramaro&#x27;s song, &quot;Cade la Pioggia,&quot; of their CD, &quot;La Finestra&quot;, and in 2008 he released the new album &quot;Safari&quot;.

In 2008 he performed as guest artist on the track &quot;Lugar Comum&quot; from the album &quot;Encanto&quot;. At the end of 2009, he collaborated with Claudio Baglioni and Fabrizio Bosso, along with 70 other artists, in the song &quot;Con tutto il mio cuore (with All My Heart).&quot; On 1 January 2010 the group released &quot;Baciami Ancora (Kiss Me Again)&quot; for the soundtrack of a film by Gabriele Muccino.

In December 2010 he achieved a number one hit on the Italian Top 20 charts with &quot;Tutto l&#x27;amore che ho.&quot; On 25 January 2011, he released his eighteenth album &quot;Ora&quot;. Later in 2011 he played at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.

== Commitment ==
Along with the evolution of his sound, his social and political commitment for mainstream causes has increased since the 1990s. As a convinced pacifist, he frequently worked with organizations such as Make Poverty History, Amnesty International, and he has contributed to events dedicated to debt relief (Global Call to Action Against Poverty).

Jovanotti has a friendship with Bono due to their mutual quest for the cancellation of foreign debt in poor African countries. He also collaborated with Michael Franti of Spearhead on his &quot;Capo Horn&quot; and &quot;Ora&quot; albums. Both Michael Franti and U2 misspelled his name as Giovanotti in the liner note credits.

== Television ==
Even though Jovanotti has never had a UK chart hit under his own name, he was briefly known in the United Kingdom as the presenter of the DEF II programme &quot;Gimme 5&quot;. The show, which featured a brief introduction each week by Jovanotti, showcased youth television programmes from around the world. Starting in 1990, he also hosted the similarly formatted &quot;Earth to MTV&quot; for U.S. cable television; this music-video showcase competed with similar programming on VH1 (&quot;New Visions: Worldbeat&quot;), Bravo (&quot;Big World Cafe&quot;), and Spanish-language Telemundo (&quot;MTV Internacional&quot;) and Univision (&quot;Tu Musica&quot;).

In 2020 he released exclusively for RaiPlay the documentary in sixteen episodes &quot;Non voglio cambiare Pianeta&quot; &quot;(I don&#x27;t want to change Planet)&quot; which he filmed whilst travelling from Chile to Argentina on his bicycle, between January and February 2020.

In 2025, he was announced as a special guest of Sanremo Music Festival.

== Gino Latino ==
Jovanotti was behind one of two rival Gino Latino italo house tracks in the early 1990s. His Gino Latino single, &quot;Welcome&quot;, reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart.

<text>Sir Arthur Temple &quot;Dick&quot; Franks (13 July 1920 – 12 October 2008) was Head of the British Secret Intelligence Service from 1979 to 1982.

==Career==
Educated at Rugby School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, Franks was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1940. He became an Intelligence officer in the Western Desert and then joined the Special Operations Executive.

He started his career by &quot;earning a reputation for daring military exploits against Nazi Germany before pursuing a fruitful career on Her Majesty’s secret service.&quot;

After the War he briefly worked for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; before joining the Secret Intelligence Service in 1946. He became involved in Operation Boot, a plan to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh, the nationalistic Iranian Prime Minister in 1953. He was posted to Bonn in 1962 and was promoted to Deputy Chief in 1977. He was appointed Chief of the Service in 1978, in place of Brian Stewart, the Director of Support Services.

As Chief, Franks was forced to contend with budget cuts, which he accepted for fear that SIS would otherwise be merged with the Security Service. One of the consequences of these cuts was the virtual closure of the MI6 station in Tehran – and the sole remaining officer was forbidden from operating out of the British Embassy by Ambassador Anthony Parsons – forcing him to instead rent a flat and depend on briefs delivered by SAVAK.

==Personal==
He lived at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. Franks was a member of the Travellers Club and still made regular visits into the last years of his life, often reminiscing with old colleagues from the intelligence world.

He was nicknamed &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Dickie&quot;.

Sir Colin McColl, former head of MI6, said: “He [Franks] was extremely effective yet also sensitive, intelligent and a most delightful man.”

<text>Sir Colin Frederick Figures (1 July 1925 – 8 December 2006) was Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (known as MI6) from 1981 to 1985. During this time he had oversight of the supply of human intelligence information, including Argentine positions and their stocks of Exocet missiles, to the UK Government during the Falklands War.

==Career==
Figures was born in Birmingham, the son of Frederick Figures, an insurance executive, and his wife Muriel. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham and served in The Worcestershire Regiment from 1943 until 1948, during which time he studied Russian via the Inter-Service Language Course at Cambridge, and served in Romania and Hungary. He read French and Russian at Pembroke College, Cambridge after being demobilised in 1948. While there, he also founded the Woodpeckers, a combined Oxford and Cambridge touring rugby team. He joined the SIS when he graduated in 1951.

After a period in London, he served in Germany, served in Amman during the Suez Crisis, in Warsaw, and in Vienna during the Prague Spring, before returning to London. He moved from Eastern bloc espionage in 1973 to supervise SIS activities in Northern Ireland. He became deputy head of SIS in 1979 and its ninth Chief in 1981. The following year, SIS was involved in the Falklands War, seeking to prevent Argentina obtaining stocks of Exocet missiles to be carried by their Super Etendard attack aircraft. He received an OBE in 1969 and CMG in 1978, and advanced to KCMG in 1983.

He retired from SIS in 1985, and became Intelligence Co-ordinator at the Cabinet Office. He finally retired in 1989.

He married Pamela Ann Timmis in 1956. He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in later life, and died in Esher. He was survived by his wife, and their son and two daughters.

<text>Sir Christopher Keith Curwen, (9 April 1929 – 18 December 2013) was a British Intelligence officer specialising in South East Asia who was Head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1985 to 1989.

==Career==
Curwen was educated at Sherborne School and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge after which he was commissioned into the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars in 1948, serving in Malaya. He joined SIS in 1952 and was posted to Thailand in 1954 and Vientiane, Laos in 1956. He returned to the service&#x27;s London headquarters in 1958, had another spell in Bangkok from 1961 and then two years in Kuala Lumpur. He was at one time married to a woman from Burma; they were later divorced.

Curwen spent three years as SIS liaison officer in Washington D.C. from 1968 and was then head of station in Geneva. He was deputy to Sir Colin Figures from 1980 and succeeded him as Chief of the Service in 1985. His tenure was notable for the successful exfiltration from Moscow of the KGB officer and British agent Oleg Gordievsky.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted: &quot;He possessed a romantic patriotism that belied his hard-headed persona.&quot;

<text>A national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks to or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation—not necessarily a nation state, but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or . National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols. 
==History==

In medieval times Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; was taken to be based on historical facts, and the Trojan War came to be considered as seminal in the genealogies of European monarchies. Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; was taken to be the Roman equivalent of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, starting from the Fall of Troy and leading up to the birth of the young Roman nation. According to the then-prevailing conception of history, empires were born and died in organic succession and correspondences existed between the past and the present. Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th-century classically inspired &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, for example, fulfilled this function for the British or Welsh. Just as kings longed to emulate great leaders of the past, Alexander or Caesar, it was a temptation for poets to become a new Homer or Virgil. In 16th-century Portugal, Luís de Camões celebrated Portugal as a naval power in his &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; while Pierre de Ronsard set out to write &quot;La Franciade&quot;, an epic meant to be the Gallic equivalent of Virgil&#x27;s poem that also traced back France&#x27;s ancestry to Trojan princes.

The emergence of a national &quot;ethos&quot;, however, preceded the coining of the phrase &quot;national epic&quot;, which seems to originate with Romantic nationalism. Where no obvious national epic existed, the &quot;Romantic spirit&quot; was motivated to fill it. An early example of poetry that was invented to fill a perceived gap in &quot;national&quot; myth is Ossian, the narrator and supposed author of a cycle of poems by James Macpherson, which Macpherson claimed to have translated from ancient sources in Scottish Gaelic. However, many national epics (including Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot;) antedate 19th-century romanticism.

Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; (1834) is often considered the last epic poem in European literature.

Since the early 20th century, the phrase has no longer necessarily applied to an epic poem, and occurs to describe a literary work that readers and critics agree is emblematical of the literature of a nation, without necessarily including details from that nation&#x27;s historical background. In this context the phrase has definitely positive connotations, as for example in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; where it is suggested &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is Spain&#x27;s national epic while Ireland&#x27;s remains as yet unwritten: They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.&lt;br&gt;

<text>The Geisel School of Medicine is the medical school of Dartmouth College located in Hanover, New Hampshire. The fourth oldest medical school in the United States, it was founded in 1797 by New England physician Nathan Smith. It is one of the seven Ivy League medical schools.

Several milestones in medical care and research have taken place at Dartmouth, including the introduction of stethoscopes to U.S. medical education (1838), the first clinical X-ray (1896), and the first multispecialty intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States (1955).

The Geisel School of Medicine grants the Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. The school has a student body of approximately 700 students and more than 2,300 faculty and researchers. Geisel organizes research through over a dozen research centers and institutes, attracting more than $140 million in grants annually, and is ranked as a top medical school by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for both primary care and biomedical research. Geisel has numerous clinical partners, including Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, White River Junction Veterans Administration Medical Center, California Pacific Medical Center, and Manchester Veterans Administration Medical Center.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years ===
Dartmouth College&#x27;s medical school was founded in 1797 as the fourth medical school in the United States, following the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (1765), the medical school of King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University) (1767), and Harvard Medical School (1782). The founder was Nathan Smith, a Harvard University and University of Edinburgh Medical School educated physician from Cornish, New Hampshire. Noting the dearth of medical professionals in the rural Connecticut River Upper Valley area, Smith petitioned the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College in August 1796 to fund the establishment of a medical school to train more physicians for the region. Though Dartmouth College as a whole was financially strapped, the Board approved the request, and Smith began lecturing on November 22, 1797.

For much of its early life, the school consisted only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds from the state of New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.

Smith acted as the sole administrator and instructor of the medical school until 1810 when a second faculty member was hired. Smith also revamped the curriculum, allowing the school to begin offering the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1812. Smith ultimately left Dartmouth in 1816, founding three additional schools of medicine at Yale University, Bowdoin College, and the University of Vermont.

=== Expansion ===

Smith&#x27;s departure provided for a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith&#x27;s replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS &#x27;57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby&#x27;s defunct hospital.

In 1908, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching conducted a survey of medical education institutions in the United States. At the time, the discipline emphasized &quot;bedside teaching&quot; and providing students experience with a broad variety of illnesses and patients. The school&#x27;s rural location was deemed too remote for proper clinical training, and the school was advised to stop offering the Doctor of Medicine degree and only provide pre-clinical instruction. The class of 1914 was the last (until 1974) to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree; subsequent classes of students attended DMS for two years before transferring to other medical schools. The drop of clinical instruction worsened the school&#x27;s problems by driving away talented faculty members.

After World War II, the tide of the medical discipline had shifted towards research. Although the school was well regarded for preparing students for clinical education at other institutions, its faculty was criticized for its apparent disinterest in research. The school was also criticized for using Dartmouth College&#x27;s undergraduate program as a feeder school. Based on these criticisms, DMS was placed on &quot;confidential probation&quot; in 1956 by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Council on Medical Education.
=== &quot;Refounding&quot; ===

At the time of the probation, Dartmouth College had already anticipated the medical school&#x27;s plight, amassing capital to fund a revitalization of the school. In 1956, the trustees of the college formally agreed to a &quot;refounding&quot; of the school&#x27;s academic offerings, physical facilities, and faculty. S. Marsh Tenney, DMS class of 1944, was appointed to carry out this task. Tenney more than doubled the size of the faculty and the student body, added several new departments, and oversaw the construction of five new campus buildings by 1964.

In the 1960s, due to a national shortage of physicians and government incentives for schools that increased their class sizes, Dartmouth Medical School graduates began to experience difficulty in trying to transfer to other medical schools to complete their final two years of medical school as other medical schools had increased their class size and could not accommodate transfer students. In the meantime, Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital had grown to be a 400-bed medical center, and Dartmouth Medical School had established a partnership with a 224-bed Veterans Administration Hospital in White River Junction, Vermont. The Doctor of Medicine program, now possible with the expanded local medical centers, was reinstated by a vote of the trustees in 1968. The admission of M.D. candidates resumed in 1970. Initially, the medical school curriculum was three years in length, unlike most medical schools, but it later was increased to the usual four years in 1979.

A cooperative program with Brown Medical School began in 1981 where students received training at both medical schools. Fifteen to twenty students were selected for the program, which combined the first two years of basic science coursework at Dartmouth with the final two years of clinical coursework at Brown. The program balanced Dartmouth&#x27;s greater basic science facilities than Brown, but fewer clinical facilities than available at the urban setting of Brown, which is located in Providence, Rhode Island. Graduates of the program received M.D. degrees from Brown. The program was discontinued in 2010.

=== New Medical Center ===

In 1991, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center was established on a campus in Lebanon, New Hampshire. The three-year project, completed at the cost of $228 million, served as a replacement for the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, which was partially demolished in the early 1990s. A new curriculum was introduced in 1996 entitled &quot;New Directions.&quot; The curriculum, still in place today, seeks to promote small classes, reduce the amount of lectures, and offer students extensive interactive experience with patients. 2009 saw the successful completion of a $250 million capital campaign.

On April 4, 2012, the Dartmouth Medical School was renamed the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine in honor of their many years of generosity to the college.

== Facilities ==

The Geisel School of Medicine has facilities on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is situated in the Upper Valley town of Hanover, New Hampshire, as well at the hospital campus of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

The medical school facilities at Dartmouth College sit in a complex on the north end of Dartmouth&#x27;s campus and includes academic, administrative, research, and presentation facilities. Geisel School of Medicine is served by two libraries, the Dana Biomedical Library and the Matthews-Fuller Health Sciences Library, which together offer over 240,000 volumes. Off-campus housing is available through Dartmouth College. In addition, the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center was completed in August 2011 at a cost of $92 million.

Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, in nearby Lebanon, New Hampshire, is the primary affiliated teaching hospital of the Geisel School of Medicine. The 396-bed inpatient facility acts as the medical school&#x27;s teaching hospital and main teaching site. Other constituent elements include the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic (a network of physicians in Vermont and New Hampshire) and a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vermont. In total, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center serves an area with a population of 1.6 million.

In addition to on-campus instruction in Hanover and Lebanon, third- and fourth-year students may choose from 75 regional sites for their clerkships. Most clerkship facilities are located in central New England, although students are also able to clerk at sites in Alaska, Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Florida.

== Academics ==
=== Degree programs ===
The Geisel School of Medicine offers the four-year Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in certain fields.

There are six PhD programs based in the Geisel School of Medicine: pharmacology and toxicology, molecular and cell biology, immunology, molecular pathogenesis, systems biology, and experimental and molecular medicine. Research and teaching positions at the Geisel School of Medicine and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates.

In addition to the MD degree, Geisel medical students participate in the following joint-degree programs at Dartmouth:
* MD/PhD program with the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies at Dartmouth
* MD/MBA program with the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
* MD/MPH and MD/MS programs with The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice
* MD/MS program with the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth

=== Curriculum ===
The MD curriculum spans four years, combining required courses with electives. First-year students learn human anatomy and basic biomedical science in classes offered by the basic science departments, while beginning a two-year course of study in clinical studies. Second-year students study pathophysiology and take courses from almost every clinical and basic science department in the school. In their third year, students are required to participate in six eight-week medical clerkships with area medical institutions, covering both ambulatory clinics and hospitals. The final year is spent on additional clerkships, the designation of an area of focus, and preparation for a post-graduation residency. In addition to imparting medical and clinical knowledge, the MD program is designed to teach interpersonal and communications skills, professionalism, and other practical skills for a medical career.

=== Admissions ===

Admission to the MD program at the Geisel School of Medicine is highly selective. Geisel receives approximately 7,000 applications each year for about 92 places in the entering class. In 2021, the acceptance rate was 3.1%.

In 2021, the Geisel School of Medicine ranked 45th in research and 24th in primary care by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 2021, the Liaison Committee for Medical Education (LCME) granted the Geisel School of Medicine a full eight-year term of accreditation, the longest available.

=== Organization ===
Similar to Dartmouth College, the Geisel School of Medicine operates on a quarter system. The school is directly managed by a Dean who is advised by a 22-member Board of Overseers. Part of the larger institution, the Geisel School of Medicine is ultimately administered by Dartmouth&#x27;s president and Board of Trustees. , the school operates on a budget of $237 million.

=== Research and publications ===
Besides research conducted within the infrastructure of academic departments, research at Geisel is also organized around over a dozen research centers and institutes. The centers cover various medical subjects such as neuroscience, oncology (Dartmouth Cancer Center), psychiatry, and pediatrics. Funded research at Geisel School of Medicine amounted to $140 million during the 2012–2013 academic year.

The medical school publishes a magazine, &quot;Dartmouth Medicine&quot;. In addition, the school also publishes an innovative medical literary journal, Lifelines (literary journal).

== People ==

=== Student profile and student life ===
The Geisel School of Medicine&#x27;s enrollment totaled 700 students: 360 M.D. candidates and 340 graduate students. In addition to the student body, over 350 resident physicians and research fellows were on campus . The student population is split approximately evenly between men and women, while about 25 percent of the student body is made up of international or minority students. From an average class size of 75, over 60 undergraduate institutions and most of the U.S. states are represented. According to &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;, the small class size at Geisel helps to establish &quot;a strong sense of community and collaborative spirit.&quot; The school offers dozens of community service, recreational, professional, and other student groups.

=== Faculty ===
As of November 2007, the Geisel School of Medicine employs a staff of 2,315 faculty and researchers: 766 full-time faculty, 1,301 part-time faculty and non-faculty instructors, and 248 research positions. The ratio of full-time, on-site faculty to students is given by the school as 2:1. Notable current faculty include Stuart Gitlow, palliative care physician Ira Byock, former astronaut and Democratic politician Jay C. Buckey, psychoanalyst Peter A. Olsson, and Jay Dunlap, professor and chair of genetics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Notable former faculty include biochemist Mahlon Hoagland, pathologist and geneticist Kurt Benirschke, and former Surgeon General of the United States C. Everett Koop.

<doc id="981604" wikidata="Q4799982" url="?curid=981604" title="Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle">
<text>Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, KG (died 3 March 1542) was an illegitimate son of the English king Edward IV, half-brother-in-law of Henry VII, and an uncle of Henry VIII, at whose court he was a prominent figure and by whom he was appointed Lord Deputy of Calais (1533–40). The survival of a large collection of his correspondence in the Lisle Letters makes his life one of the best documented of his era.

==Biography==

Arthur Plantagenet was born between 1461 and 1475 in Calais, which was then an English possession in France. He died at the Tower of London, where he is buried. The identity of his mother is uncertain; the most likely candidate appears to be the &quot;wanton wench&quot; Elizabeth Wayte, although the historical record is spotty on this issue, and it is not entirely clear that Wayte is distinct from another of Edward&#x27;s mistresses, Elizabeth Lucy. Another possible candidate is Elizabeth Shore. His godfather was William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel.

He spent his childhood at the court of his father Edward IV. How he passed his youth after his father&#x27;s death in 1483 is not known. In 1501 he joined the household of his half-sister, the queen consort Elizabeth of York, and moved to the household of Henry VII after her death in 1503. After the accession of his nephew Henry VIII in 1509, he was formally designated an Esquire of the King&#x27;s Bodyguard and was a close companion of Henry&#x27;s (despite the age difference).

In 1514 he was appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire and made captain of the Vice-Admiral&#x27;s ship &quot;Trinity Sovereign,&quot; rising to become Vice-Admiral of England. In 1519 he and his wife, Elizabeth Grey Baroness Lisle, took possession of the lands that had belonged to her father (her brother and niece having both died). In 1520, he attended his nephew, King Henry VIII, at the Field of Cloth of Gold.

On 25 April 1523, Arthur Plantagenet was created Viscount Lisle. In 1524, he was invested as Knight of the Garter. He was also selected Privy Councilor, Governor of Calais, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and named as Constable of Calais after the death of John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners on 16 March 1533.

==Constable of Calais==

The Lisle Letters suggest that as Constable of Calais he was honest and conscientious but not especially competent. Among the letters is one from Thomas Cromwell rebuking him for referring trivial matters back to the king and Council, criticising him for his inability to refuse a favour to anyone who asks for one, and hinting that Lady Lisle&#x27;s dominant influence over him has made him something of a laughing stock. 

Yet the Crown itself did not hesitate to employ him on routine errands: in 1537 queen consort Jane Seymour during her pregnancy developed a passion for quail, and since quail were abundant in the marshes around Calais, Lisle had to devote much time to supplying them to the Queen.

==Imprisonment and death==
In 1540, several members of the Plantagenet household in Calais were arrested on suspicion of treason, on the charge of plotting to betray the town to the French. Suspicion unavoidably fell upon Arthur as well, and he was recalled to England and eventually arrested on 19 May 1540.

The actual conspirators were executed, but there was no evidence connecting Arthur with the plot. Nevertheless, he languished in the Tower of London for two years until the king decided to release him. However, upon receiving news that he was to be released he suffered a heart attack and died two days later. The 18th-century historian Francis Sanford commented &quot;Henry VIII&#x27;s Mercy was as fatal as his Judgments&quot;.

==Lisle Letters==
During his time in Calais, Arthur and his wife had to manage much of their affairs outside Calais by correspondence. Copies of 3,000 of these letters were seized as evidence after Arthur was arrested. They survive in the Public Record Office, and were published in abridged form as the Lisle Letters, becoming a valuable historical resource for a critical period in English history.

==Marriages and children==
Arthur Plantagenet married twice, producing children by his first wife only.

His first marriage was on 12 November 1511 to Elizabeth Grey (died 1529), daughter of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle (died 1492). She was the widow of Edmund Dudley, treasurer to King Henry VII, who had been executed in 1510 by Henry VIII. The next day the king granted Arthur some of the Dudley estates which had come to the crown due to Dudley&#x27;s attainder. By Elizabeth he had three daughters:
*Frances, who married twice: firstly to her step-brother John Basset (1520–1541) of Umberleigh, Devon, the son of Arthur&#x27;s second wife by her first marriage, Honor Grenville (died 1566); secondly Frances married Thomas Monke (c. 1515 – c. 1583) of Potheridge, Devon, of an ancient Devonshire family. Her great-grandson by this marriage was George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608–1670).
*Elizabeth, who married Sir Francis Jobson, Member of Parliament for Colchester
*Bridget, who married William Carden [Cawarden]

Secondly, in 1529 as her second husband, he married Honor Grenville (1493–1566) the daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513) of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, by his wife Isabella Gilbert. She was the widow of Sir John Bassett (1462–1528) of Umberleigh, Devon. Arthur had no children by Honor, but he helped to bring up her children, including John Basset, who became the husband of his daughter Frances from his first marriage; Anne Bassett, an alleged mistress of Henry VIII, and Elizabeth Bassett, a royal maid-of-honour also known as Mary Bassett.

==Arms==
Before his first marriage, Arthur Plantagenet bore his paternal arms, with baton sinister azure for bastardy, of Edward, 4th Duke of York (later King Edward IV): Quarterly 1st: Arms of King Edward III; 2nd &amp; 3rd: &quot;Or a cross gules&quot; (de Burgh), 4th: &quot;Barry or and azure, on a chief of the first two pallets between two base esquires of the second over all an inescutcheon argent&quot; (Mortimer). The arms of Edward, 4th Duke of York, emphasise his descent from Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence (1338–1368), third son of King Edward III (on which basis the House of York claimed the throne), who married Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster (1332–1363). Their daughter Philippa de Burgh married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, whose son Roger de Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, was the great-grandfather of Edward, 4th Duke of York.

After his first marriage, Arthur Plantagenet added an inescutcheon of pretence of Grey, Viscounts Lisle, quarterly of six, 1st: &quot;Barry of six argent and azure in chief three torteaux&quot; (Grey, Viscount Lisle); 2nd: &quot;Barry of argent and azure, an orle of martlets gules&quot; (Valence, Earl of Pembroke); 3rd: &quot;Gules, seven mascles or conjoined 3, 3, 1&quot; (Ferrers of Groby); 4th: &quot;Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or&quot; (Talbot); 5th: &quot;Gules, a fesse between six crosses crosslet or&quot; (Beauchamp); 6th: &quot;Gules, a lion statant guardant argent crowned or&quot; (Lisle); in chief a label of three points argent.

He bore as crest: &quot;On a cap of maintenance gules turned up ermine, and inscribed in front with the letter A, a genet guardant per pale sable and argent, standing between two broom-stalks proper&quot;. The broom plant (&quot;Planta genista&quot;) inspired the naming of the Plantagenet dynasty and the genet alluded to it.

<text>Romford Market is a large outdoor retail market located in Romford in the London Borough of Havering, England. The market right was established by royal order in 1247. Rival markets are prohibited within . Governance of the market was strengthened by the 1465 charter of the Liberty of Havering, which was administered from a court house at the western end of the market. Formerly a livestock and agricultural market, cattle was last sold in 1958. The market has been in local authority ownership since it was purchased by the Romford Local Board in 1892 and is now owned by Havering Council. The marketplace was located on the main east–west road through the town until traffic was diverted away from the market in 1969. The market is promoted as a filming location. It is open on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. There was a Sunday market from July 2020 to March 2024. As of July 2020 it has 60 licensed traders, down from a peak of over 300.

==History==
===Market of the Havering manor===
It originated as a sheep market that was operating by 1247. The market right on Wednesdays was established by royal writ in 1247, although no charter was issued. Under common law no other market is permitted to set up within a day&#x27;s sheep drive, which is taken to be from the marketplace.

The 1247 market right did not provide for the governance for the market. By the 15th century, it had become popular with buyers and sellers from the City of London and other areas outside of Havering, who were beyond the authority of the manorial court and therefore outside of its powers of enforcement. This caused the prominent families in Havering to seek new rights in a charter in 1465. The manor gained status as the Liberty of Havering, with paid officers including a clerk of the market. A court house (also known as the market house) was located at the western end of the market. This housed the clerk of the market and other liberty officers.

Reflecting the change in focus of the town towards the market, the Church of St Edward the Confessor was built to the north of the marketplace around 1410.

The market was famous for leather goods by the 15th century, which were manufactured in Hornchurch and Romford. Havering residents were exempt from tolls to use the market, which were being charged by 1619.

The market is the subject of a 1726 legal case called &quot;Keech v. Sandford&quot;. This is one of the foundational cases of English trust law, on the fiduciary duty of loyalty.

===Era of change===

In 1819 improvement commissioners were set up for the market place and principal streets of the town. They were empowered to levy rates for paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing. The church was rebuilt in 1849/1850 and was designated as a listed building in 1952, with the adjacent 15th/16th century Church House.

The market was the property of the Crown until 1828, when the manor of Havering was sold to Hugh McIntosh. On his death in 1840 it passed to his son David McIntosh. When David died in 1881 it passed to his widow, Charlotte McIntosh. Romford Local Board made several unsuccessful attempts to lease the market from Charlotte McIntosh between 1882 and 1887. There was a legal dispute between them in 1887 about the location of a weighbridge in the market, which the local board believed was blocking a right of way. McIntosh won the case. In 1889 the local board turned down an offer to lease the market, claiming that it was in decline. The opening of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway stations at Dagenham, Hornchurch and Upminster in 1885 had made it easier to reach Barking Market from those communities.

Until the early 19th century the market was mostly used for the sale of cattle. By the end of that century the eastern end was used for the sale of pigs and cattle whereas at the western end farm tools, clothing, fruit and vegetables could be found. It was a major agricultural market during the 18th and 19th centuries, with a corn exchange established in 1845, enlarged in 1861, and closed in 1924.

In 1892 the Board of Agriculture ordered the closure of the market, because of a failure to complete paving and drainage works. It was decided at a public meeting that year for the local board to purchase the market and complete the works. The market and old court house were purchased for £7,000 in 1892. The market house building was used as offices by the Romford Local Board and then Romford Urban District Council until 1931. It was demolished in 1933, to make way for the Quadrant Arcade.

The market gained a reputation for the black market sales of rationed goods during and immediately after the Second World War.

The livestock market went into decline after the Second World War. The last sale of horses took place on 13 May 1948. The sale of cattle in the market ended on 21 May 1958, giving way to food, clothing and household goods.

The 1965 Romford central area redevelopment plan led to the demolition of buildings to the south of the market. The market and adjacent streets were designated a conservation area on 1 April 1968. The market was located on the high street, the main east–west road through the town. In 1969 through road traffic was removed from the market as part of the development of the Romford ring road. In 1973 there were around 325 regular traders.

The Lamb and the Golden Lion public houses became listed buildings in 1979.

===Recent history===

In 1989 Havering Council objected to the creation of a market in Ilford, using the rights of 1247.

The marketplace is promoted as a location for filming. In 2005 it was used to film parts of the music video for Voodoo People (Pendulum Remix) by The Prodigy.

It was noted by the council that the number of traders was in long-term decline with 339 traders in 1985, 266 traders in 1995 and 170 traders in 2005. By 2015 the number of regular traders had declined to 90.
In 2010 the layout of the market was altered to provide wider aisles, better access from the Liberty Shopping Centre and improved electricity supply to the stalls.

The market was closed from 24 March to 3 June 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. As of July 2020 the market had 60 regular traders.

The Romford business improvement district (BID) was created in 2019, covering the town centre and market. Since 2021, two pitches in the market are sponsored by the BID at weekends between April and October to introduce new small businesses to the market.

Regular opening on Sunday began in July 2020. The Sunday market closed in March 2024 as part of Havering Council budget cuts.

In 2023 Havering Council attempted to use the market rights to block the opening of the consolidated Dagenham Dock wholesale market to the general public.

==Operation==
The market is owned and operated by Havering Council. It is open on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The Wednesday market is operated using the 1247 rights. On other days provisions of the Food Act 1984 (c. 30) are used as the legal basis.

==Transport==
The market is a hub on the London Bus network with services from stops on St Edwards Way to Canning Town, Leytonstone, Stratford, Rainham, Dagenham, Barkingside, Cranham, Barking, Ilford and Central London.

<text>XMLGUI is a KDE framework for designing the user interface of an application using XML, using the idea of actions.

In this framework, the programmer designs various actions that their application can implement, with several actions defined for the programmer by the KDE framework, such as opening a file or closing the application. Each action can be associated with various data including icons, explanatory text, and tooltips.

The interesting part to this design is that the actions are not inserted into the menus or toolbars by the programmer. Instead, the programmer supplies an XML file, which describes the layout of the menu bar and toolbar. Using this system, it is possible for the user to redesign the user interface of an application without needing to touch the source code of the program in question.

In addition, XMLGUI is useful for the KParts component programming interface for KDE, as an application can easily integrate the GUI of a KPart into its own GUI. The Konqueror file manager is the canonical example of this feature.

The current version is KDE Frameworks#KXMLGUI.

==Other projects==
The name is somewhat generic. The Beryl XML GUI was formerly named xmlgui, and there are a dozen other xml-oriented gui-libraries with the same project name. The KDE XMLGUI is one in a long series of projects that have not managed to pin down the term for the resulting programming base.

<doc id="981614" wikidata="Q881336" url="?curid=981614" title="Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt">
<text>The Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt (BTT shunt), previously known as the Blalock–Taussig Shunt (BT shunt), is a surgical procedure used to increase blood flow to the lungs in some forms of congenital heart disease such as pulmonary atresia and tetralogy of Fallot, which are common causes of blue baby syndrome. The procedure involves connecting a branch of the subclavian artery or carotid artery to the pulmonary artery. In modern practice, this procedure is temporarily used to direct blood flow to the lungs and relieve cyanosis while the infant is waiting for corrective or definitive surgery when their heart is larger. The BTT shunt is used in the first step of the three-stage palliation (the Norwood procedure).

==Alternatives==

While the originally described Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt directly connected the subclavian and pulmonary arteries, in contemporary practice a modified version of the procedure, the mBTT shunt, is more commonly used. In the modified Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt, a length of artificial tubing typically made from PTFE (Teflon) is sewn between either the subclavian or the carotid artery and the corresponding side branch of the pulmonary artery. This modification removes the need to cut off blood supply and makes it easier to regulate the blood flow to the lungs. Some centers now use a shunt directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, a Sano shunt. This is done to avoid the reduced diastolic blood flow in the coronary circulation associated with the mBTT shunt.

==History==

The original procedure was named for Alfred Blalock, surgeon, Culloden, GA (1899–1964), Helen B. Taussig, cardiologist, Baltimore/Boston (1898–1986) and Vivien Thomas (1910–1985) who was at that time Blalock&#x27;s laboratory assistant. They all helped to develop the procedure. Taussig, who treated hundreds of infants and children with this disorder, had observed that children with a cyanotic heart defect and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) lived longer than those without the PDA. It, therefore, seemed to her that a shunt that mimicked the function of a PDA might relieve the tetralogy patients&#x27; poor oxygenation. In 1943, having broached the possibility of a surgical solution to Robert Gross of Boston without success, Taussig approached Blalock and Thomas in their Hopkins laboratory in 1943. According to the account of the original consultation between the three provided in Vivien Thomas&#x27; 1985 autobiography &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot;, Taussig carefully described the anomaly of Tetralogy of Fallot, but made no suggestion about the specific surgical correction required, observing merely that it should be possible to get more blood to the lungs, &quot;as a plumber changes pipes around.&quot; Although Taussig was not aware of it at that time, Blalock and Thomas had already experimented with such an anastomosis, one that Blalock had conceived years earlier for a different purpose but which had the unanticipated effect of re-routing blood to the lungs. The operation involved the joining of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery. After meeting with Taussig, the two men set about perfecting the operation in the animal lab, with Thomas performing the subclavian-to-pulmonary anastomosis alone in some 200 laboratory dogs, then adapting the instruments for the first human surgery from those used on the experimental animals and coaching Blalock through the first 100 operations on infants.

Thomas&#x27; autobiographical account, corroborated by the participants in the early tetralogy operations (Denton Cooley and the late William P. Longmire, Jr., intern and resident respectively during the surgery) has led to the recent conclusion that Thomas&#x27; contribution, both experimentally and clinically, was so critical that he should have received credit for the procedure along with Blalock and Taussig. However, because of the racial prejudices of the time, and the academic custom which generally precluded mention of non-degreed lab assistants (Thomas had no formal education beyond high school), he did not receive the honor of having the shunt named after him. The 2004 HBO television movie &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;, based on &quot;Washingtonian&quot; writer Katie McCabe&#x27;s 1989 article of the same name, was made about his role in the historic Blue Baby surgery, as was the 2003 public television documentary &quot;Partners of the Heart.&quot;

<text>Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller (25 April 1725 – 5 January 1776) was a German zoologist.

Statius Müller was born in Esens, and was a professor of natural science at Erlangen. Between 1773 and 1776, he published a German translation of Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Natursystem&quot;. The supplement in 1776 contained the first scientific classification for a number of species, including the dugong, guanaco, potto, tricolored heron, umbrella cockatoo, red-vented cockatoo, and the enigmatic hoatzin. He was also an entomologist.

Müller died in Erlangen.

He is not to be confused with Salomon Müller (1804–1864), also an ornithologist, or with Otto Friedrich Müller.

<text>POP-2 (also called POP2) is a programming language developed around 1970 from the earlier language POP-1 (developed by Robin Popplestone in 1968, originally named COWSEL) by Robin Popplestone and Rod Burstall at the University of Edinburgh. It drew roots from many sources: the languages Lisp and ALGOL 60, and theoretical ideas from Peter J. Landin. It used an incremental compiler, which gave it some of the flexibility of an interpreted language, including allowing new function definitions at run time and modification of function definitions while a program runs (both of which are features of dynamic compilation), without the overhead of an interpreted language.

==Description==

===Stack===
POP-2&#x27;s syntax is ALGOL-like, except that assignments are in reverse order: instead of writing

 a := 3;

one writes

 3 -&gt; a;

The reason for this is that the language has explicit notion of an &quot;operand stack&quot;. Thus, the prior assignment can be written as two separate statements:

 3;

which evaluates the value 3 and leaves it on the stack, and

 -&gt; a;

which pops the top value off the stack and assigns it to the variable &#x27;a&#x27;. Similarly, the function call

 f(x, y, z);

can be written as

 x, y, z; f();

(commas and semicolons being largely interchangeable) or even

 x, y, z.f;

or

 (x, y, z).f;

Because of the stack-based paradigm, there is no need to distinguish between &quot;statements&quot; and &quot;expressions&quot;; thus, the two constructs

 if a &gt; b then
 c -&gt; e
 else
 d -&gt; e
 close;

and

 if a &gt; b then
 c
 else
 d
 close -&gt; e;

are equivalent (use of , as hadn&#x27;t become a common notation yet).

===Arrays and doublet functions===
There are no special language constructs to create arrays or record structures as they are commonly understood: instead, these are created with the aid of special builtin functions, e.g., (for arrays that can contain any type of item) and to create restricted types of items.

Thus, array element and record field accessors are simply special cases of a &quot;doublet function&quot;: this is a function that had another function attached as its &quot;updater&quot;, which is called on the receiving side of an assignment. Thus, if the variable contains an array, then

 3 -&gt; a(4);

is equivalent to

 updater(a)(3, 4);

the builtin function returning the updater of the doublet. Of course, is a doublet and can be used to change the updater component of a doublet.

===Functions===
Variables can hold values of any type, including functions, which are first-class objects. Thus, the following constructs

 function max x y; if x &gt; y then x else y close end;

and

 vars max;
 lambda x y; if x &gt; y then x else y close end -&gt; max;

are equivalent.

An interesting operation on functions is &quot;partial application&quot;, (sometimes termed &quot;currying&quot;). In partial application, some number of the rightmost arguments of the function (which are the last ones placed on the stack before the function is involved) are &quot;frozen&quot; to given values, to produce a new function of fewer arguments, which is a closure of the original function. For instance, consider a function for computing general second-degree polynomials:

 function poly2 x a b c; a * x * x + b * x + c end;

This can be bound, for instance as

 vars less1squared;
 poly2(% 1, -2, 1%) -&gt; less1squared;

such that the expression

 less1squared(3)

applies the closure of poly2 with three arguments frozen, to the argument 3, returning the square of (3 - 1), which is 4. The application of the partially applied function causes the frozen values (in this case 1, -2, 1) to be added to whatever is already on the stack (in this case 3), after which the original function poly2 is invoked. It then uses the top four items on the stack, producing the same result as

 poly2(3, 1, -2, 1)

i.e.

 1*3*3 + (-2)*3 + 1

===Operator definition===
In POP-2, it was possible to define new operations (operators in modern terms).

 vars operation 3 +*;
 lambda x y; x * x + y * y end -&gt; nonop +*

The first line declares a new operation +* with precedence (priority) 3. The second line creates a function f(x,y)=x*x+y*y, and assigns it to the newly declared operation +*.

==History==
The original version of POP-2 was implemented on an Elliott 4130 computer in the University of Edinburgh (with only 64 KB RAM, doubled to 128 KB in 1972).

POP-2 was ported to the ICT 1900 series on a 1909 at Lancaster University by John Scott in 1968.

In the mid-1970s, POP-2 was ported to BESM-6 (POPLAN System).

In 1978 Hamish Dewar implemented a version of POP-2 specifically for use by Edinburgh University undergraduates in the AI2 (Artificial Intelligence, 2nd year level) class using the EMAS operating system. This implementation was written from scratch in the Edinburgh programming language, IMP.

Later versions were implemented for Computer Technology Limited (CTL) Modular One, PDP-10, ICL 1900 series (running the operating system George). Julian Davies, in Edinburgh, implemented an extended version of POP-2, which he named &quot;POP-10&quot; on the PDP-10 computer running TOPS-10. This was the first dialect of POP-2 that treated case as significant in identifier names, used lower case for most system identifiers, and supported long identifiers with more than 8 characters.

Shortly after that, a new implementation known as &quot;WPOP&quot; (for WonderPop) was implemented by Robert Rae and Allan Ramsay in Edinburgh, on a research-council funded project. That version introduced caged address spaces, some compile-time syntactic typing (e.g., for integers and reals), and some pattern matching constructs for use with a variety of data structures.

In parallel with that, Steve Hardy at University of Sussex implemented a subset of POP-2, which he named &quot;POP-11&quot; which ran on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/40 computer. It was originally designed to run on the DEC operating system RSX-11D, in time-shared mode for teaching, but that caused so many problems that an early version of Unix was installed and used instead. That version of Pop-11 was written in Unix assembly language, and code was incrementally compiled to an intermediate bytecode which was interpreted. That port was completed around 1976, and as a result, Pop-11 was used in several places for teaching. To support its teaching function, many of the syntactic features of POP-2 were modified, e.g., replacing with and adding a wider variety of looping constructs with closing brackets to match their opening brackets instead of the use of for all loops in POP-2. Pop-11 also introduced a pattern matcher for list structures, making it far easier to teach artificial intelligence (AI) programming.

Around 1980, Pop-11 was ported to a VAX-11/780 computer by Steve Hardy and John Gibson, and soon after that it was replaced by a full incremental compiler (producing machine-code instead of an interpreted intermediate code). The existence of the compiler and all its subroutines at run time made it possible to support far richer language extensions than are possible with Macros, and as a result Pop-11 was used (by Steve Hardy, Chris Mellish and John Gibson) to produce an implementation of Prolog, using the standard syntax of Prolog, and the combined system became known as Poplog, to which Common Lisp and Standard ML were added later. This version was later ported to a variety of machines and operating systems and as a result Pop-11 became the dominant dialect of POP-2, still available in the Poplog system.

Around 1986, a new AI company Cognitive Applications Ltd., collaborated with members of Sussex university to produce a variant of Pop-11 named &quot;AlphaPop&quot; running on Apple Mac computers, with integrated graphics. This was used for many commercial projects, and to teach AI programming in several universities. That it was implemented in an early dialect of C, using an idiosyncratic compiler made it very hard to maintain and upgrade to new versions of the Mac operating system. Also, AlphaPop was not &quot;32-bit clean&quot; due to the use of high address bits as &quot;tag bits&quot; to signify the type of objects, which was incompatible with the use of memory above 8 Mb on later Macintoshes.

<text>The Blackface or Scottish Blackface is a British breed of sheep. It is the most common sheep breed of the United Kingdom. Despite the name, it did not originate in Scotland, but south of the border.
== History ==

The origins of the breed are uncertain. It originated south of the Anglo-Scottish border, and did not arrive in the Highlands of Scotland until the second half of the eighteenth century. It replaced the earlier Scottish Dun-face or Old Scottish Shortwool, a Northern European short-tailed sheep type probably similar to the modern Shetland.

There are several types of Blackface in the United Kingdom, including the Perth variety, which is large-framed and coarse-woolled, and found mainly in north-east Scotland, in Devon, in Cornwall and in Northern Ireland; the medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, found in much of Scotland and in parts of Ireland; and the Northumberland Blackface, which is large with relatively soft wool.

== Characteristics ==

The Blackface is always horned. The face and legs are black, sometimes with white markings.

== Use ==

The Blackface is reared principally for meat production, usually through cross-breeding. Blackface ewes are commonly put to Blue-faced Leicester rams to produce the Scottish Mule or Scottish Greyface. Ewes of this cross-breed retain some characteristics of each parent – maternal qualities and hardiness from the dam, and fecundity and meat quality from the sire – and are much used in commercial lowland sheep-rearing.

The wool is very coarse, with a fibre diameter of and a staple length of about . It may be used for mattresses, for carpets, or to make tweed.

<text>The Heinkel He 60 was a German single-engined biplane reconnaissance seaplane designed to be catapulted from &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy) warships of the 1930s.

==Development and design==

The Heinkel He 60 was designed by Heinkel engineer Reinhold Mewes, the designer of the He 59. The resulting design was a single-engined biplane of mixed wood and metal construction with fabric covering. Its single bay wings were of equal-span and had significant stagger.

The first prototype flew early in 1933 and proved to be underpowered with its 492 kW (660 hp) BMW VI engine. The second prototype had a more powerful version of the BMW engine, but this only marginally improved its performance and was unreliable, so production aircraft reverted to the original engine. Of conventional configuration, the He 60 was a sturdy aircraft, designed (as the specification required) to be capable of operating on the open sea. As a result, it was always somewhat underpowered for its weight, which made handling sluggish and the aircraft vulnerable to enemy fire. Attempts were made to solve its lack of power by fitting one aircraft with a Daimler-Benz DB 600 engine, but engines were not available for production. About 200 He 60Cs and Ds were built by Arado and Weser.

==Operational history==

Initial deliveries of the He 60 were to &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; training units in June 1933. From 1934, the major production version, the He 60C began to be delivered to the shipboard observation seaplane units of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, operating from the catapults of all German cruisers. It also saw action with Spanish Nationalist forces during the Civil War.

In 1939 it was replaced as a shipboard aircraft first by the He 114 in service, then soon after by the Arado Ar 196, but it remained in service with several coast reconnaissance &quot;Staffeln&quot; (squadrons) when World War II began. It had been withdrawn from front-line service by 1940, but returned to use following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, being used by various SAGr (Seeaufklarungsgruppe/Maritime reconnaissance group) for coastal patrol work in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. All He 60s were removed from service by October 1943.

==Variants==
;He 60a
:First prototype which began flight testing in early 1933.
;He 60b
:Second prototype which experimented with a more powerful engine. However, it proved no better and the design reverted to that used in the 60a.
;He 60c
:Third prototype, used for successful catapult trials in early 1933. This aircraft was delivered into operational service with the navy.
;He 60A
:14 pre-production aircraft were ordered. A total of 81 A-variant aircraft were produced.
;He 60B
:Initial production version, commencing in 1934.
;He 60B-3
:In 1933 a single aircraft was fitted with a 671 kW (900 hp) Daimler-Benz DB 600 engine in an effort to improve performance. However, the development was dropped.
;He 60C
:In late summer 1934, the improved C-variant went into production, with first deliveries in Autumn 1934.
;He 60D
:The D-variant was similar to the He 60C, with the capability added for a fixed MG-17 machine gun and improved radio equipment. Production commenced in June 1936.
;He 60E
:6 aircraft were ordered by Spain, and these D-variants were called the 60E, ending delivery in April 1937. They flew coastal patrols in the Spanish Civil War, and the last aircraft were withdrawn from service in 1948.

<text>Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (born 1 August 1976) is a Romanian chess grandmaster. His peak FIDE rating was 2707 in October 2005, when he was ranked fifteenth in the world, and the highest rated Romanian player ever. Only in September 2022 his rating was overpassed by grandmaster Bogdan-Daniel Deac.

Nisipeanu won the European Individual Chess Championship 2005 in Warsaw with 10 points out of 13 games, half a point ahead of runner-up Teimour Radjabov from Azerbaijan.

In April 2006, Nisipeanu played FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov in a four-game match. Topalov won by a score of 3:1. The match was not for any official title.

In April 2014, Nisipeanu started playing under the German flag.

<text>The Mercantile Rowing Club is based in Melbourne, Australia on the Yarra River. It was founded in 1880 and has occupied its current site since 1885. More than 40 Mercantillians have represented Australia at Olympic Games.

==Club history==
A group of sportsmen interested in the advancement of amateur rowing met at Young and Jackson&#x27;s Hotel on 19 September 1880 and the Mercantile Rowing club was born. William S Boyd was a driving influence and the club&#x27;s first Captain. The club was initially named The Junior Warehouseman&#x27;s Rowing Club and then changed its name in 1881. Boats and facilities were borrowed from the Greenlands boatshed next to the Prices Bridge until 1884 when the member&#x27;s decided to lease land and build their own boatshed at the club&#x27;s current location.

The current boathouse was built in 1973, after a fire destroyed the previous shed on 6 May 1973.

==Competition history &amp; representative success==

<text>Hypermodernism is a school of chess that emerged after World War I. It featured challenges to the chess ideas of central European masters, including Wilhelm Steinitz&#x27;s approach to the and the rules established by Siegbert Tarrasch.

==Overview==
The Hypermodernists demonstrated their new ideas with games and victories. Aron Nimzowitsch, considered the founder and leading practitioner of hypermodernism, showed that games could be won through indirect control of the centre, breaking with Tarrasch&#x27;s view that the centre must be occupied by pawns. Nimzowitsch advocated controlling the centre with distant pieces rather than with pawns, thus inviting the opponent to occupy the centre with pawns, which can then become targets of attack. This was part of the hypermodern framework, which Nimzowitsch encapsulated in his book &quot;My System&quot;, which greatly influenced many chess players. It introduced and formalised concepts of the , , undermining, prophylaxis, restraint, rook on the seventh , knight outposts, the dynamics of the isolated queen&#x27;s pawn, and other areas of chess.

Although none of the primary exponents of the Hypermodern school ever achieved the title of World Chess Champion, they were among the world&#x27;s strongest players. World Champion Alexander Alekhine was associated with hypermodernism, but his style was more of a blend with the Classical school.

In practice, hypermodernism has not replaced the classical theory of Steinitz and Tarrasch. Instead, modern chess textbooks describe hypermodernism as an addition, or extension, to classical theory.

Hypermodern openings include the Réti Opening, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Nimzowitsch Defence, Grünfeld Defence, Bogo-Indian Defence, Old Indian Defence, Catalan Opening, King&#x27;s Indian Attack, Alekhine&#x27;s Defence, Modern Defence, Pirc Defence, Larsen&#x27;s Opening, and to a lesser degree the English Opening. Openings such as 1.a3 do not constitute hypermodern openings since, although they delay the occupation of the centre with pawns, they also delay piece .

==History==
Howard Staunton and many of his 19th-century contemporaries understood various ideas associated with hypermodernism. The Hypermodern school of chess theory came to prominence in the 1920s. Leading members were Aron Nimzowitsch, Richard Réti, Savielly Tartakower, Gyula Breyer, Efim Bogoljubov, and Ernst Grünfeld, who all came from Central Europe. They felt that chess was becoming boring, slow, and not worthwhile. They also believed that chess could not be defined by a simple set of laws or principles, such as those laid out by Siegbert Tarrasch.

Their ideas were thus a challenge to the existing orthodoxy popularised by Tarrasch in the 1890s. This orthodoxy was a rather dogmatic distillation of the ideas worked out by chess pioneer Wilhelm Steinitz. Steinitz was the first player who in his play demonstrated a mastery of , and the ideas he developed came to be known as the &quot;Classical&quot; or &quot;Modern&quot; school of thought. This school of thought emphasised the importance of &quot;static&quot; advantages such as avoidance of pawn weaknesses, strong outposts for knights, and striving for &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;bad&quot; bishops in positions with locked pawn structures. This school of thought was in turn a reaction to the earlier swashbuckling style of Adolf Anderssen, Henry Blackburne, and others, who represented the Romantic school.

In 1922, Réti published &quot;Die neuen Ideen im Schachspiel&quot; (English: &quot;The New Ideas in Chess&quot;), an examination of the evolution of chess thinking from the time of Paul Morphy through the beginning of the Hypermodern school. The name &quot;hypermodern&quot; was originated by Tartakower; his book &quot;Die hypermoderne Schachpartie&quot; (English: &quot;The Hypermodern Chess Game&quot;) was published in 1924. Nimzowitsch&#x27;s book &quot;Mein System&quot; (English: &quot;My System&quot;) was published in 1925 through to 1927 in five installments. It discusses elements of hypermodernism, but focuses mainly on positional chess.

<text>Hypermodernism is a cultural, artistic, literary and architectural successor to modernism and postmodernism in which the form (attribute) of an object has no context distinct from its function. Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time. Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes (most conspicuously physical form) as discordant with function. While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the &quot;box&quot; or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box (reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value) so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous. Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute. Synchrony between previously-clashing objects (now attributes) and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it.

==First use==
The term was coined by the French philosopher Gilles Lipovetsky in 1994. He introduced &quot;hyper-modern,&quot; a concept akin to post-modernism but with a heightened and inexorable significance, emphasizing new technologies, markets, and global culture.

==Relationship to modernism and postmodernism==
Post-modernism and modernism debated each another in an industrial/physical context and were concerned with the social value of objects themselves. Modernism focused on confining form within the limited function of a 1950s object while 1970&#x27;s postmodernism focused on freeing form from its limited function (&quot;there-is-no-box&quot;). The modern/postmodern oversight of objects as a mediator between attribute and function led to redundant human-context thinking and false conflicts between objects such as ideas.

==Propelled by technological advances==
Technology has played a definitive role in function catching up to attribute. An example is the touchscreen, in which the attribute on the screen (ratio, shape, color, animation) becomes the focus of interaction as opposed to manipulation by an external tool i.e. cellphone keyboard. In the long-term the object ceases to become the middleman between attribute (form) and function.

==Non-composability of objects==
Hypermodernism holds that an object is by definition non-composable toward its attributes; and no one attribute of an object can act as a proxy for the object itself. No whole, or object, is reducible to ONLY its attributes; and the attributes may not be mutually exclusive to the object itself. Furthermore, an object may have extraneous functions independent of its composing attributes (postmodern theory); this potential supra-functionality is a key concern to hypermodernism&#x27;s attempt to replace objects with attributes. Attributes, while having the functions of an object, are not building blocks toward an object in hypermodernism. No object is by definition hypermodern; however, an object can be more hypermodern or less hypermodern than another object.
==Long-term effects==
Hypermodernism displays a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It can be described as anti-object; however it is not anti-materialistic. Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function. Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive. Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear as in the case of the physical keyboard. Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous.

==Human psychology==
Hypermodernism compensates for the tendency of human thought to extract the attributes of an object and assign those same attributes to the functions of the object. Rather than focusing on a debate over &quot;truth&quot; or non-truth and other high-context social considerations, hypermodernism focuses on questions of extraneous vs non-extraneous (In design terms, correctness and incorrectness). Hypermodernism emphasizes correctness over completeness in design in order to guard against human intuitive leaps.

<doc id="981631" wikidata="Q1389268" url="?curid=981631" title="Failure mode and effects analysis">
<text>Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA; often written with &quot;failure modes&quot; in plural) is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. A FMEA can be a qualitative analysis, but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate models are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.

A few different types of FMEA analyses exist, such as:
* Functional
* Design
* Process

Sometimes FMEA is extended to FMECA (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) to indicate that criticality analysis is performed too.

FMEA is an inductive reasoning (forward logic) single point of failure analysis and is a core task in reliability engineering, safety engineering and quality engineering.

A successful FMEA activity helps identify potential failure modes based on experience with similar products and processes—or based on common physics of failure logic. It is widely used in development and manufacturing industries in various phases of the product life cycle. &quot;Effects analysis&quot; refers to studying the consequences of those failures on different system levels.

Functional analyses are needed as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or piece-part (hardware) FMEA. A FMEA is used to structure mitigation for risk reduction based on either failure mode or effect severity reduction, or based on lowering the probability of failure or both. The FMEA is in principle a full inductive (forward logic) analysis, however the failure probability can only be estimated or reduced by understanding the &quot;failure mechanism&quot;. Hence, FMEA may include information on causes of failure (deductive analysis) to reduce the possibility of occurrence by eliminating identified &quot;(root) causes&quot;.

== Introduction ==
The FME(C)A is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the criticality analysis (CA). Successful development of an FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The FMECA should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the FMECA can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the FMECA as a design tool and in the decision-making process is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the FMECA would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the FMECA identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the FMECA should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.

Remark: For more complete scenario modelling another type of reliability analysis may be considered, for example fault tree analysis (FTA); a &quot;deductive&quot; (backward logic) failure analysis that may handle multiple failures within the item and/or external to the item including maintenance and logistics. It starts at higher functional / system level. An FTA may use the basic failure mode FMEA records or an effect summary as one of its inputs (the basic events). Interface hazard analysis, human error analysis and others may be added for completion in scenario modelling.

=== Functional failure mode and effects analysis ===
The analysis should always be started by someone listing the functions that the design needs to fulfill. Functions are the starting point of a well done FMEA, and using functions as baseline provides the best yield of an FMEA. After all, a design is only one possible solution to perform functions that need to be fulfilled. This way an FMEA can be done on concept designs as well as detail designs, on hardware as well as software, and no matter how complex the design.

When performing a FMECA, interfacing hardware (or software) is first considered to be operating within specification. After that it can be extended by consequently using one of the 5 possible failure modes of one function of the interfacing hardware as a cause of failure for the design element under review. This gives the opportunity to make the design robust against function failure elsewhere in the system.

In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the piece part level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called an FMECA.

=== Ground rules ===
The ground rules of each FMEA include a set of project selected procedures; the assumptions on which the analysis is based; the hardware that has been included and excluded from the analysis and the rationale for the exclusions. The ground rules also describe the indenture level of the analysis (i.e. the level in the hierarchy of the part to the sub-system, sub-system to the system, etc.), the basic hardware status, and the criteria for system and mission success. Every effort should be made to define all ground rules before the FMEA begins; however, the ground rules may be expanded and clarified as the analysis proceeds. A typical set of ground rules (assumptions) follows:
# Only one failure mode exists at a time.
# All inputs (including software commands) to the item being analyzed are present and at nominal values.
# All consumables are present in sufficient quantities.
# Nominal power is available

=== Benefits ===
Major benefits derived from a properly implemented FMECA effort are as follows:

# It provides a documented method for selecting a design with a high probability of successful operation and safety.
# A documented uniform method of assessing potential failure mechanisms, failure modes and their impact on system operation, resulting in a list of failure modes ranked according to the seriousness of their system impact and likelihood of occurrence.
# Early identification of single failure points (SFPS) and system interface problems, which may be critical to mission success and/or safety. They also provide a method of verifying that switching between redundant elements is not jeopardized by postulated single failures.
# An effective method for evaluating the effect of proposed changes to the design and/or operational procedures on mission success and safety.
# A basis for in-flight troubleshooting procedures and for locating performance monitoring and fault-detection devices.
# Criteria for early planning of tests.

From the above list, early identifications of SFPS, input to the troubleshooting procedure and locating of performance monitoring / fault detection devices are probably the most important benefits of the FMECA. In addition, the FMECA procedures are straightforward and allow orderly evaluation of the design.

== History ==
Procedures for conducting FMECA were described in 1949 in US Armed Forces Military Procedures document MIL-P-1629, revised in 1980 as MIL-STD-1629A. By the early 1960s, contractors for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were using variations of FMECA or FMEA under a variety of names. NASA programs using FMEA variants included Apollo, Viking, Voyager, Magellan, Galileo, and Skylab. The civil aviation industry was an early adopter of FMEA, with the Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE, an organization covering aviation and other transportation beyond just automotive, despite its name) publishing ARP926 in 1967. After two revisions, Aerospace Recommended Practice ARP926 has been replaced by ARP4761, which is now broadly used in civil aviation.

During the 1970s, use of FMEA and related techniques spread to other industries. In 1971 NASA prepared a report for the U.S. Geological Survey recommending the use of FMEA in assessment of offshore petroleum exploration. A 1973 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report described the application of FMEA to wastewater treatment plants. FMEA as application for HACCP on the Apollo Space Program moved into the food industry in general.

The automotive industry began to use FMEA by the mid 1970s. The Ford Motor Company introduced FMEA to the automotive industry for safety and regulatory consideration after the Pinto affair. Ford applied the same approach to processes (PFMEA) to consider potential process induced failures prior to launching production. In 1993 the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) first published an FMEA standard for the automotive industry. It is now in its fourth edition. The SAE first published related standard J1739 in 1994. This standard is also now in its fourth edition. In 2019 both method descriptions were replaced by the new AIAG / VDA FMEA handbook. It is a harmonization of the former FMEA standards of AIAG, VDA, SAE and other method descriptions. As of 2024, the AIAG / VDA FMEA Handbook is accepted by GM, Ford, Stellantis, Honda NA, BMW, Volkswagen Group, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (formerly Daimler AG), and Daimler Truck.

Although initially developed by the military, FMEA methodology is now extensively used in a variety of industries including semiconductor processing, food service, plastics, software, and healthcare. Toyota has taken this one step further with its design review based on failure mode (DRBFM) approach. The method is now supported by the American Society for Quality which provides detailed guides on applying the method. The standard failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, accelerated test programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a failure modes, mechanisms and effect analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.

Following the release of IATF 16949:2016, an international quality standard that requires companies to have an organization-specific documented FMEA process, many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Ford are updating their Customer Specific Requirements (CSR) to include the usage of specific FMEA software. For Ford specifically, these requirements had multiple-stage compliance deadlines of July and December of 2022.

== Basic terms ==
The following covers some basic FMEA terminology.

;Action priority (AP)
:The AP replaces the former risk matrix and RPN in the AIAG / VDA FMEA handbook 2019. It makes a statement about the need for additional improvement measures.
;Failure
:The loss of a function under stated conditions.
;Failure mode
:The specific manner or way by which a failure occurs in terms of failure of the part, component, function, equipment, subsystem, or system under investigation. Depending on the type of FMEA performed, failure mode may be described at various levels of detail. A piece part FMEA will focus on detailed part or component failure modes (such as fully fractured axle or deformed axle, or electrical contact stuck open, stuck short, or intermittent). A functional FMEA will focus on functional failure modes. These may be general (such as no function, over function, under function, intermittent function, or unintended function) or more detailed and specific to the equipment being analyzed. A PFMEA will focus on process failure modes (such as inserting the wrong drill bit).
;Failure cause and/or mechanism
:Defects in requirements, design, process, quality control, handling or part application, which are the underlying cause or sequence of causes that initiate a process (mechanism) that leads to a failure mode over a certain time. A failure mode may have more causes. &quot;For example; &quot;fatigue or corrosion of a structural beam&quot; or &quot;fretting corrosion in an electrical contact&quot; is a failure mechanism and in itself (likely) not a failure mode. The related failure mode (end state) is a &quot;full fracture of structural beam&quot; or &quot;an open electrical contact&quot;. The initial cause might have been &quot;Improper application of corrosion protection layer (paint)&quot; and /or &quot;(abnormal) vibration input from another (possibly failed) system&quot;.&quot;

== Example of FMEA worksheet ==
=== Probability (P) ===
It is necessary to look at the cause of a failure mode and the likelihood of occurrence. This can be done by analysis, calculations / FEM, looking at similar items or processes and the failure modes that have been documented for them in the past. A failure cause is looked upon as a design weakness. All the potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. This should be in technical terms. Examples of causes are: Human errors in handling, Manufacturing induced faults, Fatigue, Creep, Abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage or improper operating conditions or use (depending on the used ground rules).
A failure mode may be given a &quot;Probability Ranking&quot; with a defined number of levels. This field is also often referred to as an &quot;Occurrence Rating&quot;.

For a piece part FMEA, quantitative probability may be calculated from the results of a reliability prediction analysis and the failure mode ratios from a failure mode distribution catalog, such as RAC FMD-97. This method allows a quantitative FTA to use the FMEA results to verify that undesired events meet acceptable levels of risk.

=== Severity (S) ===
Determine the Severity for the worst-case scenario adverse end effect (state). It is convenient to write these effects down in terms of what the user might see or experience in terms of functional failures. Examples of these end effects are: full loss of function x, degraded performance, functions in reversed mode, too late functioning, erratic functioning, etc. Each end effect is given a Severity number (S) from, say, I (no effect) to V (catastrophic), based on cost and/or loss of life or quality of life. These numbers prioritize the failure modes (together with probability and detectability). Below a typical classification is given. Other classifications are possible. See also hazard analysis.

=== Detection (D) ===
The means or method by which a failure is detected, isolated by operator and/or maintainer and the time it may take. This is important for maintainability control (availability of the system) and it is especially important for multiple failure scenarios. This may involve dormant failure &quot;modes&quot; (e.g. No direct system effect, while a redundant system / item automatically takes over or when the failure only is problematic during specific mission or system states) or latent failures (e.g. deterioration failure &quot;mechanisms&quot;, like metal growing a crack, but not of critical length). It should be made clear how the failure mode or cause can be discovered by an operator under normal system operation or if it can be discovered by the maintenance crew by some diagnostic action or automatic built in system test. A dormancy and/or latency period may be entered.

=== Dormancy or latency period ===
The average time that a failure mode may be undetected may be entered if known. For example:
* Seconds, auto detected by maintenance computer
* 8 hours, detected by turn-around inspection
* 2 months, detected by scheduled maintenance block X
* 2 years, detected by overhaul task x

=== Indication ===
If the undetected failure allows the system to remain in a &quot;safe&quot; / working state, a second failure situation should be explored to determine whether or not an indication will be evident to all &quot;operators&quot; and what corrective action they may or should take.

Indications to the operator should be described as follows:
* Normal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system or equipment is operating normally.
* Abnormal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system has malfunctioned or failed.
* Incorrect. An erroneous indication to an operator due to the malfunction or failure of an indicator (i.e., instruments, sensing devices, visual or audible warning devices, etc.).

PERFORM DETECTION COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR TEST PROCESSES AND MONITORING (From ARP4761 Standard):

This type of analysis is useful to determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves an examination of the applicable failure modes to determine whether or not their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latently should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the failure effect category of concern. The FMEA can be revised if
necessary for those cases where this conservative assumption does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.

After these three basic steps the Risk level may be provided.

=== Risk level (P×S) and (D) ===
Risk is the combination of end effect probability and severity where probability and severity includes the effect on non-detectability (dormancy time). This may influence the end effect probability of failure or the worst case effect Severity. The exact calculation may not be easy in all cases, such as those where multiple scenarios (with multiple events) are possible and detectability / dormancy plays a crucial role (as for redundant systems). In that case fault tree analysis and/or event trees may be needed to determine exact probability and risk levels.

Preliminary risk levels can be selected based on a risk matrix like shown below, based on Mil. Std. 882. The higher the risk level, the more justification and mitigation is needed to provide evidence and lower the risk to an acceptable level. High risk should be indicated to higher level management, who are responsible for final decision-making.
* After this step the FMEA has become like a FMECA.

== Timing ==
FMEA should be used:

* When a product or process is being designed (or redesigned)
* When an existing product or process is applied in a novel way
* Before developing control plans or procedures for a new or redesigned process
* When trying to improve an existing product, process, or service
* When analyzing failures for an existing product, process, or service
* Periodically and regularly throughout the lifetime of the product, process, or service

The FMEA should be updated whenever:
* A new cycle begins (new product/process)
* Changes are made to the operating conditions
* A change is made in the design
* New regulations are instituted
* Customer feedback indicates a problem

== Uses ==
* Development of system requirements that minimize the likelihood of failures.
* Development of designs and test systems to ensure that the failures have been eliminated or the risk is reduced to acceptable level.
* Development and evaluation of diagnostic systems.
* To help with design choices (trade-off analysis).

== Advantages ==
* Catalyst for teamwork and idea exchange between functions
* Collect information to reduce future failures, capture engineering knowledge
* Early identification and elimination of potential failure modes
* Emphasize problem prevention
* Fulfill legal requirements (product liability)
* Improve company image and competitiveness
* Improve production yield
* Improve the quality, reliability, and safety of a product/process
* Increase user satisfaction
* Maximize profit
* Minimize late changes and associated cost
* Reduce impact on company profit margin
* Reduce system development time and cost
* Reduce the possibility of same kind of failure in future
* Reduce the potential for warranty concerns

== Limitations ==
While FMEA identifies important hazards in a system, its results may not be comprehensive and the approach has limitations. In the healthcare context, FMEA and other risk assessment methods, including SWIFT (Structured What If Technique) and retrospective approaches, have been found to have limited validity when used in isolation. Challenges around scoping and organisational boundaries appear to be a major factor in this lack of validity.

If used as a top-down tool, FMEA may only identify major failure modes in a system. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is better suited for &quot;top-down&quot; analysis. When used as a bottom-up tool FMEA can augment or complement FTA and identify many more causes and failure modes resulting in top-level symptoms. It is not able to discover complex failure modes involving multiple failures within a subsystem, or to report expected failure intervals of particular failure modes up to the upper level subsystem or system.

Additionally, the multiplication of the severity, occurrence and detection rankings may result in rank reversals, where a less serious failure mode receives a higher RPN than a more serious failure mode. The reason for this is that the rankings are ordinal scale numbers, and multiplication is not defined for ordinal numbers. The ordinal rankings only say that one ranking is better or worse than another, but not by how much. For instance, a ranking of &quot;2&quot; may not be twice as severe as a ranking of &quot;1&quot;, or an &quot;8&quot; may not be twice as severe as a &quot;4&quot;, but multiplication treats them as though they are. See Level of measurement for further discussion. Various solutions to this problems have been proposed, e.g., the use of fuzzy logic as an alternative to classic RPN model. In the new AIAG / VDA FMEA handbook (2019) the RPN approach was replaced by the AP (action priority).

The FMEA worksheet is hard to produce, hard to understand and read, as well as hard to maintain. The use of neural network techniques to cluster and visualise failure modes were suggested starting from 2010. An alternative approach is to combine the traditional FMEA table with set of bow-tie diagrams. The diagrams provide a visualisation of the chains of cause and effect, while the FMEA table provides the detailed information about specific events.

== Types ==
* Functional: before design solutions are provided (or only on high level) functions can be evaluated on potential functional failure effects. General Mitigations (&quot;design to&quot; requirements) can be proposed to limit consequence of functional failures or limit the probability of occurrence in this early development. It is based on a functional breakdown of a system. This type may also be used for Software evaluation.
* Concept design / hardware: analysis of systems or subsystems in the early design concept stages to analyse the failure mechanisms and lower level functional failures, specially to different concept solutions in more detail. It may be used in trade-off studies.
* Detailed design / hardware: analysis of products prior to production. These are the most detailed (in MIL 1629 called Piece-Part or Hardware FMEA) FMEAs and used to identify any possible hardware (or other) failure mode up to the lowest part level. It should be based on hardware breakdown (e.g. the BoM = bill of materials). Any failure effect severity, failure prevention (mitigation), failure detection and diagnostics may be fully analyzed in this FMEA.
* Process: analysis of manufacturing and assembly processes. Both quality and reliability may be affected from process faults. The input for this FMEA is amongst others a work process / task breakdown.

<text>The Karankawa were an Indigenous people concentrated in southern Texas along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, largely in the lower Colorado River and Brazos River valleys. They consisted of several independent, seasonal nomadic groups who shared a language and some culture.

From the onset of European colonization, the Karankawa had violent encounters with the Spanish. After one attack by the Spanish, who ambushed the Karankawa after the establishment of Presidio La Bahía in 1722, the Karankawa allegedly felt &quot;deeply betrayed [and] viewed Spanish colonial settlement with hostility.&quot;

In the 1820s, European-American colonists arrived in their land under the leadership of Stephen Austin. He commissioned a captain to expel the Karankawa from the Austin land grant, leading to multiple attacks, including the Skull Creek massacre of 19 Karankawa. By the 1840s, the Karankawa, now exiled, split into two groups, one of which settled on Padre Island while the other fled into the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. During 1858, Mexican rancher Juan Nepomuceno Cortina led a group of Mexicans and Texan colonists against what was believed to be the Karankawa&#x27;s last known refuge, killing many. By 1891, the Karankawa ceased to exist as a functioning tribe.

There is nearly 300 years of information written about the Karankawa Indians of Texas from La Salle&#x27;s first landing at Matagorda Bay in 1685 until the close of the Rosario Mission. The Karankawa had been described for centuries as cannibals, There is incontrovertible evidence that the Karankawa practiced ritual cannibalism on their enemy. Just as their Aztec and Guachichiles and Guamares cousins to the south in Northern Mexico, &quot;they ate their enemy for vengeance. Their bones, scalps and genitals were displayed in victory celebrations.&quot;

The first person to document the Karankawa&#x27;s cannibalism was French Jean Baptiste Talon who lived as a captive among the tribe for several years who stated in 1689:

&quot;We all went naked like them, and every morning at daybreak, in any season, they went to plunge into the nearest river. Like them, they ate meat from the hunt, fresh or cured in the sun, but most often half raw. They only meals that horrid them were those they made of human flesh as they are cannibals, but toward their savage enemies only. They never ate a single Frenchman that they had killed because, they said, [simply that] they do not eat them. And the same Jean-Baptiste Talon vouches that he once went three days without eating, because nothing presented itself during that time except some human flesh of the &quot;Ayenis&quot; whom they had killed on one of the expeditions.&quot;

Several years before this, French castaway Henri Joutel, a captain of the La Salle Expedion lived among the Cenis [Tejas] tribe and hunted with their neighboring bands who had an identical culture and langage as the Karankawa. He wrote in his manuscripts that, &quot;The warriors returned from a grand raid, parading around 48 scalps and body parts of which some of the warriors partook in cannibalizing, as it was apparently thought, in order to gain the deceased warrior’s bravery.

== Name ==
The Karankawa&#x27;s autonym is Né-ume, meaning &quot;the people&quot;.

The name Karakawa has numerous spellings in Spanish, French, and English.

Swiss-American ethnologist Albert S. Gatschet wrote that the name &quot;Karakawa&quot; may have come from the Comecrudo terms &quot;klam&quot; or &quot;glám&quot;, meaning &quot;dog&quot;, and &quot;kawa&quot;, meaning &quot;to love, like, to be fond of.&quot; The plural form of &quot;kawa&quot; is &quot;kakáwa&quot;, so the term would mean &quot;dog-lovers&quot; or &quot;dog-raisers.&quot;

The Tonkawa called them Wrestlers (&quot;Keles&quot; or &quot;Killis&quot;). They alternatively called them the barefooted or those without moccasins (&quot;Yakokon kapa-i&quot;), but this name was also applied to other groups with which the Tonkawe were acquainted. The Lipan Apache called the Karankawa the &quot;people who walk in the water&quot; (&quot;Nda Kun dadehe&quot;), possibly referring to their mode of fishing and catching turtles, or simply their location near the swampy coast. The Karankawa called themselves &quot;Karankawa&quot; as well.

Later speculation placed the Karankawa language in the Cariban linguistic stock. Linguistic data suggests that the Karankawa name originated from the old Spanish Main, &quot;Kalina,&quot; and a suffix from a Northern Carib tribe, &quot;kxura,&quot;meaning &quot;people;&quot; a compound emerges: Karinxkxura, meaning &quot;Carib people.&quot; But this theory is disputed and ultimately, the origins of the name &quot;Karankawa&quot; remain unknown.

Alternate spellings of the name Karankawa have historically included: Carancahua, Carancagua, Carancaguase, Carancahuare, Caranchuasye, Carancahuase, Carancahuaye, Carancahuaze, Carancohuace, Caray, Carrai, Carray, Saray.

== Origins ==
According to some contemporary sources, the migrations of their ancestors were entirely unknown to the Karankawa of the early 19th century. Linguist Herbert Landar, however, argues that based on linguistic evidence, the Karankawa language and people originated from a Carib subgroup, which remains to be discovered. Their exact migratory path northward is equally indistinct. Migration northward is theorized to have occurred during the late 15th century. The route north was from the original land north of the Amazon River toward Tamaulipas and Texas, and was probably done over a long period of time by short bursts of migration. Scholars have speculated that the Karankawa were descended from a group of Carib Indians who arrived by sea from the Caribbean basin. This is partially based on the similarity of their physical appearance to Caribbean natives, but no ethnographic or archaeological evidence has been found for this speculation.

Recent archaeological records that used radiocarbon dating for artifacts indicated that these Native groups had been in the area as early as the fifth millennium BCE.

== Lifestyle ==

=== Seasonal nomadic lifestyle ===
The Karankawa voyaged from place to place on a seasonal basis in their dugouts, made from large trees with the bark left intact. They travelled in groups of thirty to forty people and remained in each place for about four weeks. After European contact, canoes were of two kinds, both being called &quot;awa&#x27;n&quot;: the original dugout and old skiffs obtained from the whites. Neither was used for fishing but for transportation only, and their travels were limited to the waters close to the land. The women, children, and possessions travelled in the hold while the men stood on the stern and poled the canoe. Upon landing at their next destination, the women set up wigwams (called &quot;ba&#x27;ak&quot; in their native language) and the men hauled the boats on the shore. Their campsites were always close to the shoreline of the nearby body of water.

They constructed houses by arranging willow branches in a circle, bending the tops of the branches toward the center, and interlocking them in wickerwork. This wickerwork was fastened with deerskin. Upon this framework, the Karankawa lay deer, wildcat, panther or bear skins, again fastened with deer hide thongs.

The next step was to make a fire. After European contact, the Karankawa sought matches or tinderboxes from settlers; otherwise, they resorted to the traditional method of using their firesticks, which they always carried in a package of deerhide thongs. The fire was always made in the center of their dwellings and kept burning day and night. They used animal hides and pelts to sit and sleep on within their dwellings. Their household goods and utensils included wooden spoons, ceramic vessels, fishbone needles, and fine deer sinew.

=== Environment ===
The Karankawa traveled to the coastal region. They hunted and gathered food from rivers and by the mountains.

In the region that the Karankawa inhabited, numerous small chunks of asphaltum have been found along the coast from oil seepage beneath the Gulf of Mexico. These chunks were used to bind arrowheads to their shafts; as a coating for pottery such as ollas, jars, and bowls; and as a way to waterproof woven baskets.

=== Cuisine ===
Karankawa cuisine included venison, rabbit, fowl, fish, turtles, oysters, and other shellfish. Their cuisine also included food gathered from the wild, such as berries, persimmons, wild grapes, sea-bird eggs, &quot;tuna&quot; and &quot;nopales&quot; (prickly pear cactus fruit and paddles, respectively), and nuts. They boiled food in ceramic pots or roasted entrés and seasoned their dishes with chile.

After European contact, the Karankawa made bread from imported wheat flour. They laid the dough on a flat stone then baked it on an open fire. They also enjoyed imported sweet coffee.

The Karankawa were skilled at obtaining pure, fresh water. White settlers did not know where they obtained it, because the wells of the whites had a brackish taste.

== Culture ==

=== Language and communication ===
Little is known of the extinct Karankawa language, which may have been a language isolate. The Karankawa also possessed a gesture language for conversing with people from other Native American tribes.

The Karankawa were noted for their skill of communicating with each other over long distances using smoke signals. The Karankawa could make the smoke of a small fire ascend toward the sky in many different ways, and it was as intelligible to them across long distances as their language. Their methods are unknown.

=== Manners and customs ===
The Karankawa had a specific way of conversing. They carefully repressed their breath while speaking; at the end of their sentences, they exhaled heavily, releasing the air they held back during speaking. Moreover, their expression was interpreted by Europeans as impassive, especially because they never looked at the person to whom they were speaking. Their pronunciation was very exact, and they ridiculed poor elocution by the whites who tried to learn their language. The Europeans described their general demeanor as surly and fatigued.

They did not have a regular sleep schedule, but slept whenever they wished. They also ate and drank at all times of the day.

Karankawa never communicated their native names to the whites. However, they all adopted English or Spanish names. Many men adopted American military epithets and Christian names, and they would change these frequently.

Among the Karankawa existed an in-law taboo. Once a man and his wife had become, in the Karankawa sense, married, the husband and his children were no longer allowed to enter the residence of his wife&#x27;s parents, nor could his wife&#x27;s parents enter his or his children&#x27;s home. These two groups were also no longer allowed to talk with one another and never came face to face with one another. If a situation of coming face to face with one another arose, both parties averted their eyes and moved away from each other. This taboo only seemed to apply to the husbands and their children, most likely due to inconvenience on the wife&#x27;s part, as Karankawans were typically patrilocal.

=== Arts, athletics, and recreation ===

The Karankawa possessed at least three musical instruments - a large gourd filled with stones, which was shaken to produce sound, a fluted piece of wood, which the Karankawa drew a stick over to produce sound, and a flute, which was softly blown.

The Karankawa practiced hatchet throwing, recreational brawls with knives, ball games, and wrestling matches. No gambling or guessing games seemed to have developed among the Karankawa. The Karankawa were also noted for their remarkable physical feats, such as continuing to fight after being wounded in battle, breaking ice with their bodies, and swimming in freezing water.

==== Archery ====
Their most notable skill was archery. The Karankawa made their own bows and arrows, and were renowned for great skill whether standing on land or in calm or turbulent waters. Their bows were made of red cedar wood and they made them according to the height of each archer, reaching from the foot to the chin or eye. The bows were always kept in perfect repair. The arrows were about a yard long, tipped with steel, and fletched with wild goose feathers. Karankawa engaged in archery for hunting and as a recreational activity. They often shot at the mark or shot arrows perpendicularly into space. The shooting matches they held were lively and festive. Many young men were able to split in two the previous arrow in the target from a distance of at least 80 feet.

=== Social institutions ===

==== Tribal leadership ====
The groups of Karankawa were commonly led by two chiefs - a civil government chief with a hereditary succession in the male lines, and a war chief, probably appointed by the civil government chief. No evidence of a confederacy, like that of the Caddo or Creeks, was found. The Karankawa were probably a loose-knit body living under separate chiefs only united by the common language and shared war expeditions.

The ritual to become a chief has been studied by 18th-century Spaniards. They have stated that a selection starts from many candidates, and each is injured by a comb created from the spines of a sea fish, long wounds being dug into their skin from the top of their heads to the soles of their feet and then tied to a pole for several days to either emerge thin or emaciated and close to death. While this description can indeed be a ritual to choose a chief, a diary of Fray Gaspar Jose De Solis states that he suspects these rituals could simply be a puberty rite or an initiation ritual to a brotherhood.

==== Gender and family structures ====
One aspect of the Karankawa culture was their recognition of three gender roles: male, female, and a third role taken on by some males and women. Males who took on this third role are called &quot;monanguia&quot; (see Two-Spirit for similar concepts in Native American cultures generally). &quot;Monanguia&quot; generally took on female roles and activities in daily life, while also playing a special role in religious rites. According to some accounts, the &quot;berdache&quot; also performed as passive sexual partners for other males.

The written accounts of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca mentions bride price and bride service as part of a Karankawa marriage. While the bride price is assumed to be the generalized system in the Indigenous population found by Cabeza de Vaca where the groom gives presents to the parents of the girl he wishes to marry, to secure their permission, the bride service is based on a ritual where the husband must give every morsel of food he managed to collect or hunt to his wife. His wife then delivers the bounty to her parents and in return is given food to give back to her husband. This ritual goes on for an unknown number of months, but when it is concluded, the pair typically then engages in patrilocal residence. In terms of marriage, divorce is a common aspect typically only to marriages that have not created any children and is unlikely if children have been born from the marriage. Between the husband and wife, no signs of fondness, intimacy, or special treatment were observed. The Karankawa reacted strongly and sometimes violently to Europeans interfering in marital or familial affairs.

The Karankawa were said to have great compassion and tenderness for their children. Mothers carried babies, not yet able to walk, on their backs, wrapped in a loop of animal hide.

=== Appearance ===

==== Physical character ====
Many Europeans noted the sharp contrasts in appearance between Karankawa men and women. The women were described as plainer, shorter, and of stouter build than the men. The men were very tall, of strong athletic build, and had coarse, black hair. Most men wore their hair to the waist. Their foreheads were mostly low and broad, and the heads larger than most Europeans of the time. The men, in contrast with the women, had lithe builds and slender hands and feet. Their skin color was said to be lighter and closer to cinnamon-colored than the women. Both men and women were noted for their spectacularly white teeth, even elders.

==== Dress and adornment ====
Karankawa people practiced forehead flattening. They shaped the foreheads of babies by first with a piece of cloth, then a thin board, and then a wadded cloth. Each of these was tied to the head with a bandage and left to stay there about one year.

The men wore hide breechcloths, while the women wore deerhide skirts. They did not wear headcovers or shoes. Some women of the tribe obtained European clothing occasionally, but would only tear them apart or wear them temporarily. European blankets were of greater use to the tribe, worn fastened to their bodies during cold weather and pinned with thorns. Both men and women wore a small bracelet of undressed deer skin. In the warm climate, children did not wear clothing until they were about 10 years old.

The Karankawa had distinctive tattoos, notably, a blue circle tattooed over each cheekbone, one horizontal blue line from the outer angle of the eye toward the ear, three perpendicular parallel lines on the chin from the middle of the lower lip downward, and two other lines extending down from under each corner of the mouth. Moreover, 16th-century European explorers wrote that Karankawa people had labrets, or piercings of cane on the lower lips, nose, and other parts of the body.

The woman in some tribes such as the Coco group also had a tattoo of concentric black circles from their nipple to circling their entire breast.

Men, women, and children alike rubbed sharks&#x27; oil on their entire bodies regularly to deter mosquitoes effectively and to keep their skin soft and supple. Europeans who encountered the Karankawa were disgusted by the odor.

The women wore no ornaments, while the men wore many ornaments. Men&#x27;s long hair was braided with three strands. They inserted bright items (such as ribbons or colored flannel). The women never braided their hair nor combed it regularly. The men wore necklaces of small shells, glass beads, pistachios, and thin metal disks on their throats (never on their chests). Men also wore finger rings.

=== Religion and ritual ===
Europeans knew limited information about the rituals of the Karankawa because the latter did not reveal the purposes of their actions or their beliefs. When Joutel, an explorer and companion of Robert Cavalier de La Salle, questioned their religious beliefs, the Karankawa only pointed at the sky.

At the full moon and after very successful hunting or fishing expeditions, the Karankawa traditionally held a ceremony. After gathering around a central fire, they boiled a strong and bitter brew from the leaves of the yaupon tree and stirred it until the top was covered with a yellowish froth. This brew was shared and all the Karankawa drank freely. Although this brew was said to be intoxicating, Europeans did not notice any visible effects on the natives. One native stood within the circle of men, wrapped up to his head in skins, and he bent over as he walked around the fire. They chanted in chromatic ascending and descending tones, and all the natives joined in the chorus. This ceremony continued throughout the night.

Other than this, only a few other rituals were observed, and their purposes are unknown. The Karankawa stared at the sun when it disappeared into the sea, like some other native groups of the area. They also smoked tobacco through their nostrils first to the north, then to the east, west, and south. They frequently whistled at certain times and apparently for some objective, but ultimately for unknown purposes.

Jean-Baptist Talon, in response to interrogation, reported, &quot;one could only infer that they have some confused impression of the immortality of their souls and the resurrection of the dead by the ceremonies that they observe in the burial of their dead. After having wrapped the corpse in a well-prepared buffalo hide, the same one that he had used in life to cover himself, they bury him with his club, his bow, and his arrows, a quantity of smoked meat, some corn and vegetables, and two pieces of a certain rock that they use instead of gun flint to make fire.For this purpose they make a little hole in one of the pieces of wood, which is flat, and which they lean against something; and having sharpened the other, which is round, they adjust the point of i in the hole and make some fire by rubbing these two pieces of wood, by turning the one that is round between their hands, as fast as they can and all that in order that he may use them (so they say) when he wakes up&quot;.

==== Cannibalism ====
According to some sources, the Karankawa practiced ritual cannibalism, in common with other Gulf coastal tribes of present-day Texas and Louisiana.

Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador who lived among the Karankawa for several years in the 1530s and wrote a memoir, made no mention of cannibalism except for ritualistic consumption of deceased relatives in the form of funeral ashes &quot;presented in water for the relatives to drink.&quot; Upon his return to Spain, Cabeza De Vaca noted in his written report to the King, &quot;that five Christians quartered on the coast [Galveston, the Island of Doom] came to the extremity of eating each other. Only the body of the last one, whom nobody was left to eat, was found unconsumed. Their names were Sierra, Diego Lopez, Corral, Palacios, and Gonzalo Ruiz,&quot;this, after shipwrecking off Galveston Bay. The Karankawa people &quot;were so shocked at this [Spanish] cannibalism that, if they had seen it sometime earlier, they surely would have killed every one of us.&quot; Whites never actually witnessed an act of cannibalism, and second- and third-hand accounts are of disputed credibility.

=== Dogs ===
The Karankawa kept dogs that accompanied them on hunts, swims, and recreational activities. The dogs were voiceless, with straight ears and fox-like snouts.

== History ==

===Early encounters with the Spanish and French (16th - 17th centuries)===

In 1528, one of two barges put together by survivors of the failed Pánfilo de Narváez expedition to Florida struck aground at Galveston Island. Survivors, including Cabeza de Vaca, were cared for by the Capoque band of Karankawa. From 1527, Cabeza de Vaca subsisted for seven years among the coastal tribes, making a living as a medical practitioner and occasional trader. During his stay, de Vaca reported that a fatal stomach ailment reduced the Karankawa population by roughly one half; the nature and casualties resulting from this illness are unknown. De Vaca reported that extensive trade occurred with inland groups as far as the extent of the entire length of the present-day United States. After the introduction of the horse by Spaniards, these trade networks strengthened.

Henri Joutel, the companion of Robert Cavelier de La Salle on his last expedition in 1687, recorded several tribes living in the coastal area, including the Karankawa (which he spelled as Korenkake and Koinekahe). His observations were that the Karankawa were peaceable rather than hostile. Upon their first meeting, Joutel reports that the Karankawa &quot;demonstrated their friendship by putting their hands over their hearts, which meant that they were glad to see us.&quot; He also noted that they possessed horses, which were undoubtedly obtained from the Spanish.

When de La Salle stole some canoes from the Karankawa to sail up a river and establish Fort St. Louis, the Karankawas were enraged. When they heard of de La Salle&#x27;s departure and subsequent death, they attacked about 20 French settlers left in the fort and massacred all but five. The survivors were forcibly tattooed and made to follow the Karankawa on their hunting and fishing expeditions; they were eventually rescued by a Spanish expedition in 1689.

=== Relations with the Spanish ===
The La Salle venture stimulated the Spanish into active exploration and colonization of south Texas. A Spanish search for Fort St. Louis to check if the French had returned led to a skirmish between the Karankawa and the Spanish, and an establishment of hostilities between these two groups.

In 1691, Captain Domingo Teran led a combined land-sea expedition to Texas to strengthen recently established missions and to search for French presence. Both expeditions were mismanaged and led to a temporary lapse in Spanish interest. Continued French action, however, encouraged the Spaniards to occupy the area of Matagorda Bay permanently.

La Bahía del Espiritu Santo, a mission-presidio complex, was established in 1722 on the southern bank of the San Antonio River. At first, the Karankawa were not antagonistic to the Spanish, but in 1723, a skirmish occurred between the Spanish and Karankawa, after which the Karankawa moved away from the mission and became hostile. By 1727, the Karankawa depredations forced the mission-presidio complex to move inland to the Guadalupe River, where they remained until 1749. The Karankawa successfully reduced Spanish claim to the Texas coast.

By the 1730s, the Karankawa and other native tribes of the Texas area were viewed by the Spanish as the primary obstacle to control of northern New Spain. In 1749, Jose Escandon was made governor and representative of the viceroy, appointed to conquer and settle northern Mexico and the region of Texas, and to map, survey, and acquaint himself with the area and with the natives. He recommended that the mission of La Bahía should be moved because of native hostility and the unfavorable climate.

A new mission, Mission Rosario, was established in 1754. It was in constant fear of revolt by the natives in the mission and often appealed to La Bahía for military aid. Overall, it was extremely ineffective as a spiritual and &quot;civilizing&quot; center. The Karankawa fled when subjected to any corporal punishment, and continued to enjoy the resources provided by the Spanish without being dependent on them.

Over time, the Karankawa grew to speak Spanish with great fluency and adopted Spanish names for themselves to facilitate interaction with the whites.

The late 18th century had a revival of Karankawa resistance and strength. The Spanish began to see them as unable to be converted to mission life, and some began to scheme for their extermination, but none of these schemes was successfully carried out.

In 1779, in response to the killing of Spanish sailors by a group of Karankawas, led by Joseph Maria, along the Texas Gulf Coast, and a later raid on Mission Rosario also masterminded by Maria that led to the mission&#x27;s abandonment by the Spanish, they planned a series of punitive expeditions against the Karankawa intended to exterminate them, although all of these proved abortive and unsuccessful, and they were abandoned as a strategy by 1786, with the war ending three years later, in 1789.

In 1806, the Rosario mission was merged with that of Refugio. In 1830, Refugio and La Bahía del Espiritu Santo were secularized.

=== Relations with the English and the French ===
While the Spanish tried to incorporate the Karankawa into their empire, the Karankawa engaged in purely economic terms with the English and the French, trading skins and deer for weapons (i.e., muskets, guns, cloth) and household goods.

===Encounters with Jean Lafitte===
When Galveston Island was occupied by the pirate Jean Lafitte from 1817 to 1821, some of his men kidnapped a Karankawa woman. In response, about 300 Karankawa moved in to attack. When Lafitte learned of their encampment and impending attack, he sent 200 of his men, armed with two cannons, to confront the Karankawa. After the Karankawa lost about 30 men, they retreated to the mainland, with the pirates in pursuit. On the mainland, a few more Karankawa were killed.

=== Encounters with the Texan colonists ===

Austin was introduced to the Karankawas by an encounter with a peaceful Coco tribe. After some talks and an exchange of tobacco and a frying pan, Moses Austin considered them good friends, but after a warning of Karankawas at the mouth of a nearby river, Moses wrote in his journal that Karankawas are universal enemies of man and cannot be befriended and must be exterminated for Anglo-American settlers to live in peace.

In 1821, Moses Austin received the Austin land grant to settle 300 families between Galveston Bay and the Colorado River. The Karankawa sought to hinder their progress by killing settlers who were guarding the ship &quot;John Motley&quot; and by stealing their supplies. By 1825, settlers banded together to attack the Karankawa. Stephen Austin commissioned Captain Kuykendall to lead volunteers to expel them from the territory, which extended to the Lavaca River. They chased the Karankawa to Manahila Creek, where a Spanish missionary interceded on their behalf and made them promise to never again go east of the Lavaca. This promise was broken, however, and was met by disproportionate violence by the Texan colonists.

=== Genocide of the Karankawa ===
During the Texan-Mexican War, some of the Karankawa served in the Mexican Army. They suffered greatly in the Battle of the Alamo of 1836, and the Texans retaliated heavily for their service.

Chief Jose Maria&#x27;s 19-year-old son, Walupe, was captured by the Mexicans and killed. His father came on board the ship of a Texan settler and announced his intent of revenge, but the majority of his men and himself were killed. Antonio, who claimed he was the brother of Jose Maria, became chief after that. During his administration and afterward, the Karankawa population diminished significantly from disease, conflict with Europeans, and infighting.

By the 1840s, the Karankawa consisted of two groups; one settled on Padre Island, while the other applied to settle in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After being exiled from their homeland, the latter group reportedly plundered and stole; the Mexican government then ordered troops to subdue them. General Avalos was ordered to move the Karankawa to the border of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León. The two states disputed over the Karankawa, and they were eventually returned to Reynosa. After continued robberies, the Karankawa were removed to Texas.

In 1858, the judge of Rosario, Mexico, sent a message to the mayor of Reynosa that he had tried to arrest the Karankawa, but they moved north of the American border beyond his jurisdiction. He added that Mexicans and Americans should work together for the Karankawas&#x27; arrest. Later that year, Juan Cortina made a surprise attack on the recently returned Karankawa and annihilated what was believed to be at the time, the last members of the tribe. In a study on the Karankawa published in 1888, one interviewee &quot;thought that some [Karankawa] may be still in existence, but could not tell where.&quot; The Karankawa went extinct as a distinct tribe in the late 19th century.

== Contemporary heritage group ==
As of 2021, a group of individuals who claim descent from the Karankawa people formed the Karankawa Kadla. They have volunteered to help preserve Corpus Christi Bay archaeological sites from oil development, develop education programs, and are interested in reviving the Karankawa language. Members of this group have family stories connecting them to the Karankawa people, amid forced assimilation among both Mexicans and White Texans and separation from other Karankawa. This organization is an unrecognized organization. They are neither a federally recognized tribe nor a state-recognized tribe.

<text>Verendrye Electric Cooperative is a public utility cooperative based in Velva, North Dakota, but also has a service center in Minot. It serves rural consumers across a seven-county area in north central North Dakota, but the bulk of its service area lies within Ward and McHenry counties. Verendrye Electric receives power from the Central Power Electric Cooperative – in fact, Verendrye took the lead in establishing Central Power in 1949 after having to deal with a 30% rate hike from its previous power supplier in 1948.

It is named after the French Canadian explorer La Vérendrye; and for its first two years, it was headquartered in the small town of Verendrye, North Dakota (northwest of Karlsruhe; now a ghost town).

<text>A music library contains music-related materials for patron use. Collections may also include non-print materials, such as digitized music scores or audio recordings. Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions. Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, printed music, music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature. Some public libraries have music rooms.

==Types==
Traditionally, there are four types of music libraries:

#Those developed to support departments of music in university or college settings;
#Those developed to support conservatories and schools of music;
#Those housed within public libraries;
#Those developed as independent libraries or archives supporting music organizations.

==Musical instrument library==
A musical instrument library lends or shares musical instruments. Examples can be found in Canada; Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Washington and New York in the United States. 

With the development of the media industry (film production, production of computer games, advertising), musical works created using digital technologies have become especially in demand, characterized by the use of various audio effects libraries and musical instruments. Over the past decade, many digital musical instrument library companies have grown, including Spitfire, Cinesamples, Heavyocity, Soundiron, and Native Instruments. Some are focused on reproducing the sounds of the instruments of the classical orchestra in digital format, others on creating libraries of traditional folk instruments, including Arabic instruments, Turkish, Iranian, Indian, Japanese and others.

==Other uses==
* Production music libraries license stock music for use in film, television, and radio productions.
* Performance libraries serve performing music groups, particularly large orchestras, by acquiring, preparing, and maintaining music for performance.
* Digital music libraries and archives preserve recordings and digitized scores or literature in a variety of electronic formats. Many music libraries dedicate part of their duties to digitizing parts of their collection and maintaining digital files. Digital materials may be part of a larger, physical collection, or may compose an entirely electronic collection not physically accessible (usually housed on a network or on the Internet). Access may be limited as a fee-based service, a private service to specific user groups (such as students at a conservatory), or freely accessible to the public.

<doc id="981643" wikidata="Q575887" url="?curid=981643" title="Pulse-repetition frequency">
<text>The pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) is the number of pulses of a repeating signal in a specific time unit. The term is used within a number of technical disciplines, notably radar.

In radar, a radio signal of a particular carrier frequency is turned on and off; the term &quot;frequency&quot; refers to the carrier, while the PRF refers to the number of switches. Both are measured in terms of cycle per second, or hertz. The PRF is normally much lower than the frequency. For instance, a typical World War II radar like the Type 7 GCI radar had a basic carrier frequency of 209 MHz (209 million cycles per second) and a PRF of 300 or 500 pulses per second. A related measure is the pulse width, the amount of time the transmitter is turned on during each pulse.

After producing a brief pulse of radio signal, the transmitter is turned off in order for the receiver units to detect the reflections of that signal off distant targets. Since the radio signal has to travel out to the target and back again, the required inter-pulse quiet period is a function of the radar&#x27;s desired range. Longer periods are required for longer range signals, requiring lower PRFs. Conversely, higher PRFs produce shorter maximum ranges, but broadcast more pulses, and thus radio energy, in a given time. This creates stronger reflections that make detection easier. Radar systems must balance these two competing requirements.

Using older electronics, PRFs were generally fixed to a specific value, or might be switched among a limited set of possible values. This gives each radar system a characteristic PRF, which can be used in electronic warfare to identify the type or class of a particular platform such as a ship or aircraft, or in some cases, a particular unit. Radar warning receivers in aircraft include a library of common PRFs which can identify not only the type of radar, but in some cases the mode of operation. This allowed pilots to be warned when an SA-2 SAM battery had &quot;locked on&quot;, for instance. Modern radar systems are generally able to smoothly change their PRF, pulse width and carrier frequency, making identification much more difficult.

Sonar and lidar systems also have PRFs, as does any pulsed system. In the case of sonar, the term pulse-repetition rate (PRR) is more common, although it refers to the same concept.

==Introduction==
Electromagnetic (e.g. radio or light) waves are conceptually pure single frequency phenomena while pulses may be mathematically thought of as composed of a number of pure frequencies that sum and nullify in interactions that create a pulse train of the specific amplitudes, PRRs, base frequencies, phase characteristics, et cetera (See Fourier Analysis). The first term (PRF) is more common in device technical literature (Electrical Engineering and some sciences), and the latter (PRR) more commonly used in military-aerospace terminology (especially United States armed forces terminologies) and equipment specifications such as training and technical manuals for radar and sonar systems. 
The reciprocal of PRF (or PRR) is called the &quot;pulse-repetition time&quot; (&quot;PRT&quot;), &quot;pulse-repetition interval&quot; (&quot;PRI&quot;), or &quot;inter-pulse period&quot; (&quot;IPP&quot;), which is the elapsed time from the beginning of one pulse to the beginning of the next pulse. The IPP term is normally used when referring to the quantity of PRT periods to be processed digitally. Each PRT having a fixed number of range gates, but not all of them being used. For example, the APY-1 radar used 128 IPP&#x27;s with a fixed 50 range gates, producing 128 Doppler filters using an FFT. The different number of range gates on each of the five PRF&#x27;s all being less than 50.

Within radar technology PRF is important since it determines the maximum target range (&quot;R&quot;max) and maximum Doppler velocity (&quot;V&quot;max) that can be accurately determined by the radar. Conversely, a high PRR/PRF can enhance target discrimination of nearer objects, such as a periscope or fast moving missile. This leads to use of low PRRs for search radar, and very high PRFs for fire control radars. Many dual-purpose and navigation radars—especially naval designs with variable PRRs—allow a skilled operator to adjust PRR to enhance and clarify the radar picture—for example in bad sea states where wave action generates false returns, and in general for less clutter, or perhaps a better return signal off a prominent landscape feature (e.g., a cliff).

==Definition==
Pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) is the number of times a pulsed activity occurs every second.

This is similar to cycle per second used to describe other types of waveforms.

PRF is inversely proportional to time period formula_1 which is the property of a pulsed wave.

:formula_2

PRF is usually associated with pulse spacing, which is the distance that the pulse travels before the next pulse occurs.

:formula_3

==Physics==
PRF is crucial to perform measurements for certain physics phenomenon.

For example, a tachometer may use a strobe light with an adjustable PRF to measure rotational velocity. The PRF for the strobe light is adjusted upward from a low value until the rotating object appears to stand still. The PRF of the tachometer would then match the speed of the rotating object.

Other types of measurements involve distance using the delay time for reflected echo pulses from light, microwaves, and sound transmissions.

==Measurement==
PRF is crucial for systems and devices that measure distance.
* Radar
* Laser range finder
* Sonar

Different PRF allow systems to perform very different functions.

A radar system uses a radio frequency electromagnetic signal reflected from a target to determine information about that target.

PRF is required for radar operation. This is the rate at which transmitter pulses are sent into air or space.

===Range ambiguity===
A radar system determines range through the time delay between pulse transmission and reception by the relation:

:formula_4

For accurate range determination a pulse must be transmitted and reflected before the next pulse is transmitted. This gives rise to the maximum unambiguous range limit:

:formula_5

The maximum range also defines a range ambiguity for all detected targets. Because of the periodic nature of pulsed radar systems, it is impossible for some radar system to determine the difference between targets separated by integer multiples of the maximum range using a single PRF. More sophisticated radar systems avoid this problem through the use of multiple PRFs either simultaneously on different frequencies or on a single frequency with a changing PRT.

The range ambiguity resolution process is used to identify true range when PRF is above this limit.

===Low PRF===
Systems using PRF below 3 kHz are considered low PRF because direct range can be measured to a distance of at least 50 km. Radar systems using low PRF typically produce unambiguous range.

Unambiguous Doppler processing becomes an increasing challenge due to coherency limitations as PRF falls below 3 kHz.

For example, an L-Band radar with 500 Hz pulse rate produces ambiguous velocity above 75 m/s (170 mile/hour), while detecting true range up to 300 km. This combination is appropriate for civilian aircraft radar and weather radar.

:formula_6

:formula_7

Low PRF radar have reduced sensitivity in the presence of low-velocity clutter that interfere with aircraft detection near terrain. Moving target indicator is generally required for acceptable performance near terrain, but this introduces radar scalloping issues that complicate the receiver. Low PRF radar intended for aircraft and spacecraft detection are heavily degraded by weather phenomenon, which cannot be compensated using moving target indicator.

===Medium PRF===
Range and velocity can both be identified using medium PRF, but neither one can be identified directly. Medium PRF is from 3 kHz to 30 kHz, which corresponds with radar range from 5 km to 50 km. This is the ambiguous range, which is much smaller than the maximum range. Range ambiguity resolution is used to determine true range in medium PRF radar.

Medium PRF is used with Pulse-Doppler radar, which is required for look-down/shoot-down capability in military systems. Doppler radar return is generally not ambiguous until velocity exceeds the speed of sound.

A technique called ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed. Doppler signals fall between 1.5 kHz, and 15 kHz, which is audible, so audio signals from medium-PRF radar systems can be used for passive target classification.

For example, an L band radar system using a PRF of 10 kHz with a duty cycle of 3.3% can identify true range to a distance of 450 km (30 * C / 10,000 km/s). This is the instrumented range. Unambiguous velocity is 1,500 m/s (3,300 mile/hour). 
:formula_8
:formula_9

The unambiguous velocity of an L-Band radar using a PRF of 10 kHz would be 1,500 m/s (3,300 mile/hour) (10,000 x C / (2 x 10^9)). True velocity can be found for objects moving under 45,000 m/s if the band pass filter admits the signal (1,500/0.033).

Medium PRF has unique radar scalloping issues that require redundant detection schemes.

===High PRF===
Systems using PRF above 30 kHz function better known as interrupted continuous-wave (ICW) radar because direct velocity can be measured up to 4.5 km/s at L band, but range resolution becomes more difficult.

High PRF is limited to systems that require close-in performance, like proximity fuses and law enforcement radar.

For example, if 30 samples are taken during the quiescent phase between transmit pulses using a 30 kHz PRF, then true range can be determined to a maximum of 150 km using 1 microsecond samples (30 x C / 30,000 km/s). Reflectors beyond this range might be detectable, but the true range cannot be identified.
:formula_10
:formula_11

It becomes increasingly difficult to take multiple samples between transmit pulses at these pulse frequencies, so range measurements are limited to short distances.

===Sonar===
Sonar systems operate much like radar, except that the medium is liquid or air, and the frequency of the signal is either audio or ultra-sonic. Like radar, lower frequencies propagate relatively higher energies longer distances with less resolving ability. Higher frequencies, which damp out faster, provide increased resolution of nearby objects.

Signals propagate at the speed of sound in the medium (almost always water), and maximum PRF depends upon the size of the object being examined. For example, the speed of sound in water is 1,497 m/s, and the human body is about 0.5 m thick, so the PRF for ultrasound images of the human body should be less than about 2 kHz (1,497/0.5).

As another example, ocean depth is approximately 2 km, so sound takes over a second to return from the sea floor. Sonar is a very slow technology with very low PRF for this reason.

===Laser===

Light waves can be used as radar frequencies, in which case the system is known as lidar. This is short for &quot;LIght Detection And Ranging,&quot; similar to the original meaning of the initialism &quot;RADAR,&quot; which was RAdio Detection And Ranging. Both have since become commonly-used english words, and are therefore acronyms rather than initialisms.

Laser range or other light signal frequency range finders operate just like radar at much higher frequencies. Non-laser light detection is utilized extensively in automated machine control systems (e.g. electric eyes controlling a garage door, conveyor sorting gates, etc.), and those that use pulse-rate detection and ranging are at heart, the same type of system as a radar—without the bells and whistles of the human interface.

Unlike lower radio signal frequencies, light does not bend around the curve of the earth or reflect off the ionosphere like C-band search radar signals, and so lidar is useful only in line of sight applications like higher frequency radar systems.

<text>Trident (also known as MSHTML) is a proprietary browser engine for the Microsoft Windows version of Internet Explorer, developed by Microsoft.

MSHTML debuted with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. For versions 7 and 8 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft made significant changes to MSHTML&#x27;s layout capabilities to improve compliance with Web standards and add support for new technologies.

MSHTML will continue to receive security updates for the IE mode of Microsoft Edge until at least 2029. However, support for new Web standards will not be added.

==Use in software development==
MSHTML was designed as a software component to allow software developers to easily add web browsing functionality to their own applications. It presents a COM interface for accessing and editing web pages in any COM-supported environment, like C++ and .NET. For instance, a web browser control can be added to a C++ program and MSHTML can then be used to access the page currently displayed in the web browser and retrieve element values. Events from the web browser control can also be captured. MSHTML functionality becomes available by linking the file to the software project.

==Release history==
==Use cases==
All versions of Internet Explorer for Windows from 4.0 onwards use MSHTML, and it is also used by various other web browsers and software components (see Internet Explorer shells). In Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000, it is also used for the Windows file manager/shell, Windows Explorer. The Add/Remove Programs tool in Windows 2000 uses MSHTML to render the list of installed programs, and in Windows XP it is also used for the User Accounts Control Panel, which is an HTML Application. MSHTML, however, was not used by Internet Explorer for Mac (which used Tasman starting with version 5.0), nor by the early versions of Internet Explorer Mobile.

Some other MSHTML-based applications include:
*AOL Explorer, a web browser
*AOL Instant Messenger 6.x, which used MSHTML to render conversation and profile windows, and advertisement panels
*EA Link, incompatible with MSHTML as of Internet Explorer 7 RC2
*Flashpoint Secure Player, uses MSHTML to run ActiveX based web games
*Google Talk, which used MSHTML to render chat windows and profile cards
*GreenBrowser, which is also presented at the BrowserChoice.eu page
*IE Tab, a browser add-on used to render pages with MSHTML user interface (originally available for both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, now only for the latter)
*Impulse (content delivery), uses MSHTML to render &quot;Explore&quot; page, as well as several of the &quot;Community&quot; pages
*LimeWire, which renders the page &quot;New@Lime&quot;
*Lunascape, developed by Lunascape Corporation
*Maxthon, which used the MSHTML engine while adding features not built into IE7
*MediaBrowser, customized browsers, especially for Nintendo
*MenuBox, a web browser
*Microsoft Compiled HTML Help
* Microsoft Encarta and related products
*Microsoft InfoPath, a forms application
*Microsoft Outlook, which uses MSHTML to render HTML Messages (prior to Outlook 2007) and the &quot;Outlook Today&quot; screen
* Microsoft Outlook Express, which uses MSHTML to render HTML Messages
* Microsoft Visual InterDev 6 uses MSHTML in editing mode as visual HTML designer
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2002-2005 uses MSHTML in editing mode to provide visual ASP.NET/HTML designer
* Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Basic to render the WebBrowser control
*MSN Messenger, which used it to produce Flash-based &quot;winks&quot; and games, and for all advertisements shown in the advertisement banner
*NeoPlanet, a web browser
*NetCaptor, a web browser
*Netscape Browser (Netscape 8), which used MSHTML to render web pages in IE mode
*Pyjs, a python Widget set Toolkit. Embedding IWebBrowser2 as an Active-X component and accessing the COM interface, Pyjs uses MSHTML for the Desktop version, through the python Win32 &quot;comtypes&quot; library.

The Steam client was updated to use WebKit instead of MSHTML for these features. Then was updated further to use the Chromium Embedded Framework
*Windows Live Writer, which uses MSHTML for its editor
*Windows Media Player, which uses MSHTML to render the &quot;Media Information&quot; pages

==Standards compliance==
Current versions of MSHTML, as of Internet Explorer 9, have introduced support for CSS 3, HTML5, and SVG, as well as other modern web standards. Web standards compliance was gradually improved with the evolution of MSHTML. Although each version of IE has improved standards support, including the introduction of a &quot;standards-compliant mode&quot; in version 6, the core standards that are used to build web pages (HTML and CSS) were sometimes implemented in an incomplete fashion. For example, there was no support for the codice_1 element which is part of the HTML 4.01 standard prior to IE 8. There were also some CSS attributes missing from MSHTML, like min-height, etc. as of Internet Explorer 6. As of Internet Explorer 8 CSS 2.1 is fully supported as well as some CSS 3.0 attributes. This lack of standards compliance has been known to cause rendering bugs and lack of support for modern web technologies, which often increases development time for web pages. Still, HTML rendering differences between standards-compliant browsers are not yet completely resolved.

==Microsoft alternatives==
Apart from MSHTML, Microsoft also has and uses several other layout engines. One of them, known as Tasman, was used in Internet Explorer 5 for Mac. Development of Internet Explorer for Mac was halted in roughly 2003, but development of Tasman continued to a limited extent, and was later included in Office 2004 for Mac. Office for Mac 2011 uses the open source WebKit engine. Microsoft&#x27;s now defunct web design product, Expression Web, as well as Visual Studio 2008 and later, do not use Internet Explorer&#x27;s MSHTML engine, but rather a different engine.

In 2014, MSHTML was forked to create the engine EdgeHTML for Microsoft Edge [Legacy] on Windows 10. The new engine is &quot;designed for interoperability with the modern web&quot; and deprecates or removes a number of legacy components and behaviors, including document modes, ensuring that pure, standards-compliant HTML will render properly in browsers without the need for special considerations by web developers. This resulted in a completely new browser called Microsoft Edge (later referred to as &quot;Microsoft Edge &quot;Legacy&quot;&quot;, with a flat blue &quot;e&quot; icon) which replaced Internet Explorer as Windows&#x27; stock browser and became the base of Microsoft&#x27;s web related services, until its replacement with a Blink / Chromium-based browser, also called Microsoft Edge (with a brand new wave-like icon) in late 2020.

<text>Tasman is a discontinued browser engine developed by Microsoft for inclusion in the Macintosh version of Internet Explorer 5. Tasman was an attempt to improve support for web standards, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium. At the time of its release, Tasman was seen as the layout engine with the best support for web standards such as HTML and CSS. Internet Explorer for Mac is no longer supported, but newer versions of Tasman were incorporated in some other Microsoft products.

In 2003, Microsoft stopped development for Internet Explorer for Mac. In 2005, they discontinued support for the browser and in 2006 removed the application from the available Microsoft downloads site.

Tantek Çelik led the software team that developed the Tasman engine. Tasman later became used as the layout engine for the MSN for Mac OS X and Office 2004 for Mac.

== Version history ==
The first version of Tasman (referred to as &quot;v0&quot;) was released with &quot;Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition&quot; on March 27, 2000. An upgraded version (version 0.1) followed on with the release of &quot;Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac&quot;.

On May 15, 2003, Microsoft released the subscription-only MSN for Mac OS X browser, which used an upgraded version of Tasman (version 0.9) as its layout engine. In a posting to the &quot;Mac Internet Explorer Talk&quot; list, Internet Explorer for Mac program manager Jimmy Grewal listed improvements:

* Full Unicode support
* Improved CSS support, with CSS 3 Selectors, CSS TV Profile and @media
* Improved DOM support with DOM 1 Core and DOM 2 Core, Style, and Events. Also improved compatibility with Windows IE DOM.
* XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 support, although it is not activated in MSN for Mac OS X.
* Better support for Mac OS X features such as CoreGraphics, ATSUI and CFSocket networking.

For a while Tasman was improved as part of a number of TV set-top box projects at Microsoft reaching version 1.0. The Tasman engine is now used in the Microsoft TV Mediaroom Edition. 

On May 11, 2004, Microsoft started shipping Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac which incorporates a version of the Tasman layout engine in its email client Entourage. Since Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, Entourage has been replaced by the Macintosh version of Microsoft Outlook which uses a WebKit-based layout engine (used by Safari) instead. Microsoft Edge, the successor to Internet Explorer, uses the Blink engine on macOS and WebKit on iOS/iPadOS.

<text>In number theory, the integer square root (isqrt) of a non-negative integer is the non-negative integer which is the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of ,
formula_1

For example, formula_2

==Introductory remark==
Let formula_3 and formula_4 be non-negative integers.

Algorithms that compute (the decimal representation of) formula_5 run forever on each input formula_3 which is not a perfect square.

Algorithms that compute formula_7 do not run forever. They are nevertheless capable of computing formula_5 up to any desired accuracy formula_4.

Choose any formula_4 and compute formula_11.

For example (setting formula_12):
formula_13

Compare the results with formula_14

It appears that the multiplication of the input by formula_15 gives an accuracy of decimal digits.

To compute the (entire) decimal representation of formula_5, one can execute formula_17 an infinite number of times, increasing formula_3 by a factor formula_19 at each pass.

Assume that in the next program (formula_20) the procedure formula_17 is already defined and — for the sake of the argument — that all variables can hold integers of unlimited magnitude.

Then formula_22 will print the entire decimal representation of formula_5.
// Print sqrt(y), without halting
void sqrtForever(unsigned int y)
 unsigned int result = isqrt(y);
 printf(&quot;%d.&quot;, result); // print result, followed by a decimal point

 while (true) // repeat forever ...
 y = y * 100; // theoretical example: overflow is ignored
 result = isqrt(y);
 printf(&quot;%d&quot;, result % 10); // print last digit of result
}
The conclusion is that algorithms which compute are computationally equivalent to algorithms which compute.

==Basic algorithms==
The integer square root of a non-negative integer formula_3 can be defined as
formula_25

For example, formula_26 because formula_27.

===Algorithm using linear search===
The following C programs are straightforward implementations.

===Linear search using addition===
In the program above (linear search, ascending) one can replace multiplication by addition, using the equivalence
formula_28
// Integer square root
// (linear search, ascending) using addition
unsigned int isqrt(unsigned int y)
 unsigned int L = 0;
 unsigned int a = 1;
 unsigned int d = 3;

 while (a &lt;= y)
 a = a + d; // (a + 1) ^ 2
 d = d + 2;
 L = L + 1;

 return L;


===Algorithm using binary search===
Linear search sequentially checks every value until it hits the smallest formula_29 where formula_30.

A speed-up is achieved by using binary search instead. The following C-program is an implementation. 
// Integer square root (using binary search)
unsigned int isqrt(unsigned int y)
 unsigned int L = 0;
 unsigned int M;
 unsigned int R = y + 1;

 while (L != R - 1)
 M = (L + R) / 2;

 if (M * M &lt;= y)
 L = M;
 else
 R = M;

 return L;


Numerical example

For example, if one computes formula_31 using binary search, one obtains the formula_32 sequence
formula_33

This computation takes 21 iteration steps, whereas linear search (ascending, starting from formula_34) needs steps.

==Algorithm using Newton&#x27;s method==
One way of calculating formula_35 and formula_36 is to use Heron&#x27;s method, which is a special case of Newton&#x27;s method, to find a solution for the equation formula_37, giving the iterative formula
formula_38

The sequence formula_39 converges quadratically to formula_35 as formula_41. 

===Stopping criterion===
One can prove that formula_42 is the largest possible number for which the stopping criterion 
formula_43
ensures formula_44 in the algorithm above.

In implementations which use number formats that cannot represent all rational numbers exactly (for example, floating point), a stopping constant less than 1 should be used to protect against round-off errors.

===Domain of computation===
Although formula_35 is irrational for many formula_46, the sequence formula_39 contains only rational terms when formula_48 is rational. Thus, with this method it is unnecessary to exit the field of rational numbers in order to calculate formula_36, a fact which has some theoretical advantages.

===Using only integer division===
For computing formula_50 for very large integers &quot;n&quot;, one can use the quotient of Euclidean division for both of the division operations. This has the advantage of only using integers for each intermediate value, thus making the use of floating point representations of large numbers unnecessary. It is equivalent to using the iterative formula
formula_51

By using the fact that
formula_52

one can show that this will reach formula_50 within a finite number of iterations.

In the original version, one has formula_54 for formula_55, and formula_56 for formula_57. So in the integer version, one has formula_58 and formula_59 until the final solution formula_60 is reached. For the final solution formula_60, one has formula_62 and formula_63, so the stopping criterion is formula_64.

However, formula_50 is not necessarily a fixed point of the above iterative formula. Indeed, it can be shown that formula_50 is a fixed point if and only if formula_67 is not a perfect square. If formula_67 is a perfect square, the sequence ends up in a period-two cycle between formula_50 and formula_70 instead of converging.

=== Example implementation in C ===

// Square root of integer
unsigned int int_sqrt(unsigned int s)
 // Zero yields zero
 // One yields one
 if (s &lt;= 1) 
 return s;

 // Initial estimate (must be too high)
 unsigned int x0 = s / 2;

 // Update
 unsigned int x1 = (x0 + s / x0) / 2;

 while (x1 &lt; x0) // Bound check
 x0 = x1;
 x1 = (x0 + s / x0) / 2;
 return x0;


=== Numerical example ===

For example, if one computes the integer square root of using the algorithm above, one obtains the sequence
formula_71
In total 13 iteration steps are needed. Although Heron&#x27;s method converges quadratically close to the solution, less than one bit precision per iteration is gained at the beginning. This means that the choice of the initial estimate is critical for the performance of the algorithm.

When a fast computation for the integer part of the binary logarithm or for the bit-length is available (like e.g. codice_1 in C++20), one should better start at 
formula_72
which is the least power of two bigger than formula_73. In the example of the integer square root of , formula_74, formula_75, and the resulting sequence is
formula_76
In this case only four iteration steps are needed.

==Digit-by-digit algorithm==

The traditional pen-and-paper algorithm for computing the square root formula_35 is based on working from higher digit places to lower, and as each new digit pick the largest that will still yield a square formula_78. If stopping after the one&#x27;s place, the result computed will be the integer square root.

===Using bitwise operations===

If working in base 2, the choice of digit is simplified to that between 0 (the &quot;small candidate&quot;) and 1 (the &quot;large candidate&quot;), and digit manipulations can be expressed in terms of binary shift operations. With codice_2 being multiplication, codice_3 being left shift, and codice_4 being logical right shift, a recursive algorithm to find the integer square root of any natural number is:
def integer_sqrt(n: int) -&gt; int:
 assert n &gt;= 0, &quot;sqrt works for only non-negative inputs&quot;
 if n &lt; 2:
 return n

 # Recursive call:
 small_cand = integer_sqrt(n » 2) « 1
 large_cand = small_cand + 1
 if large_cand * large_cand &gt; n:
 return small_cand
 else:
 return large_cand
# equivalently:
def integer_sqrt_iter(n: int) -&gt; int:
 assert n &gt;= 0, &quot;sqrt works for only non-negative inputs&quot;
 if n &lt; 2:
 return n

 # Find the shift amount. See also find first set,
 # shift = ceil(log2(n) * 0.5) * 2 = ceil(ffs(n) * 0.5) * 2
 shift = 2
 while (n » shift) != 0:
 shift += 2

 # Unroll the bit-setting loop.
 result = 0
 while shift &gt;= 0:
 result = result « 1
 large_cand = (
 result + 1
 ) # Same as result ^ 1 (xor), because the last bit is always 0.
 if large_cand * large_cand &lt;= n » shift:
 result = large_cand
 shift -= 2

 return result
Traditional pen-and-paper presentations of the digit-by-digit algorithm include various optimizations not present in the code above, in particular the trick of pre-subtracting the square of the previous digits which makes a general multiplication step unnecessary. See for an example.

==Karatsuba square root algorithm==

The Karatsuba square root algorithm is a combination of two functions: a public function, which returns the integer square root of the input, and a recursive private function, which does the majority of the work.

The public function normalizes the actual input, passes the normalized input to the private function, denormalizes the result of the private function, and returns that.

The private function takes a normalized input, divides the input bits in half, passes the most-significant half of the input recursively to the private function, and performs some integer operations on the output of that recursive call and the least-significant half of the input to get the normalized output, which it returns.

For big-integers of &quot;50 to 1,000,000 digits&quot;, Burnikel-Ziegler Karatsuba division and Karatsuba multiplication are recommended by the algorithm&#x27;s creator.

An example algorithm for 64-bit unsigned integers is below. The algorithm:

# Normalizes the input inside .
# Calls , which requires a normalized input.
# Calls with the most-significant half of the normalized input&#x27;s bits, which will already be normalized as the most-significant bits remain the same.
# Continues on recursively until there&#x27;s an algorithm that&#x27;s faster when the number of bits is small enough.
# then takes the returned integer square root and remainder to produce the correct results for the given normalized .
# then denormalizes the result.
/// Performs a Karatsuba square root on a `u64`.
pub fn u64_isqrt(mut n: u64) -&gt; u64 {
 if n &lt;= u32::MAX as u64 {
 // If `n` fits in a `u32`, let the `u32` function handle it.
 return u32_isqrt(n as u32) as u64;
 } else {
 // The normalization shift satisfies the Karatsuba square root
 // algorithm precondition &quot;a₃ ≥ b/4&quot; where a₃ is the most
 // significant quarter of `n`&#x27;s bits and b is the number of
 // values that can be represented by that quarter of the bits.
 // b/4 would then be all 0s except the second most significant
 // bit (010...0) in binary. Since a₃ must be at least b/4, a₃&#x27;s
 // most significant bit or its neighbor must be a 1. Since a₃&#x27;s
 // most significant bits are `n`&#x27;s most significant bits, the
 // same applies to `n`.
 // The reason to shift by an even number of bits is because an
 // even number of bits produces the square root shifted to the
 // left by half of the normalization shift:
 // sqrt(n « (2 * p))
 // sqrt(2.pow(2 * p) * n)
 // sqrt(2.pow(2 * p)) * sqrt(n)
 // 2.pow(p) * sqrt(n)
 // sqrt(n) « p

==In programming languages==

Some programming languages dedicate an explicit operation to the integer square root calculation in addition to the general case or can be extended by libraries to this end.

<text>Fuji News Network (FNN) is a Japanese commercial television network run by Fuji Television Network, Inc. (Fuji TV), part of the Fujisankei Communications Group. The network&#x27;s responsibility includes the syndication of national television news bulletins to its regional affiliates, and news exchange between the stations.

FNN also manages the free online service FNN Prime, visited by an average of 100 million views by month.

Distribution of non-news television programmes is handled by Fuji Network System (FNS), another network set up by Fuji TV.

==History==
The network was formed on 3 October 1966 which comprised 7 television stations: Fuji TV (the flagship station), Sendai Television, Tōkai TV, Kansai TV, Hiroshima Telecasting (now affiliated with NNN and NNS), Nihonkai Telecasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.

Since 1 April 1997, the network has 26 full members, and two members that are affiliates of more than one network (Television Oita System Co., Ltd and TV Miyazaki). In terms of the number of participating stations, it is the third largest in Japan, following NNN (NTN group) and JNN (TBS-group). FNS does not currently have any affiliates in four prefectures: Aomori, Yamanashi, Yamaguchi, and Tokushima.

<doc id="981674" wikidata="Q1323547" url="?curid=981674" title="TX Network">
<text>TXN Network (TXN) is a commercial television network in Japan owned by TV Tokyo Corporation, a subsidiary of TV Tokyo Holdings, which itself is majority controlled by Nikkei, Inc. The &quot;TX&quot; is taken from the callsign of its flagship station, TV Tokyo. It is also known as TV Tokyo Network.

==Overview==

It is named &quot;TXN&quot; because of the call sign of TV Tokyo, its key station, JOTX-DTV. The official name of the network is &quot;TXN Network&quot;, and its abbreviation is &quot;TXNN&quot;, with the &quot;N&quot; part intentionally duplicated with &quot;Network&quot;, or it could also be News and Nationwide due to ambiguous meanings. There is no official explanation about the meaning. For that reason, it is sometimes called by various aliases such as TX Network, TV Tokyo Network, TV Tokyo keiretsu, and TXN keiretsu.

Unlike other networks, it is a network that has not been distinguished from news networks, program supply networks, and network organizations since the era of the former name (described later) &quot;Mega TON Network&quot;.

Also, before TXN was officially launched, there were secondary affiliations with other stations. Chukyo Television in the complex network era and Mainichi Broadcasting in the era before the affiliation change correspond to this. First of all, the former was initially based on TV Asahi, but the Chunichi Shimbun invests in the principle of eliminating concentration. Since it was not possible to do so, it was decided to receive investment from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, so there was a network relationship with Tokyo 12 Channel → TV Tokyo. Chukyo TV subsequently joined NNN in April 1973, then NNS and became a full Nippon Television affiliated station, but until the opening of TV Aichi in 1983, partly with three other wide-area stations (Chubu Nippon Broadcasting, Tokai Television, Nagoya Television), TV Tokyo were broadcast in the form of program sales. Next, the latter was mainly NET after the establishment of the Federation of Five Companies in 1960, but in 1968 the Japan Science and Technology Foundation fell into a management crisis. At that time, Mainichi Broadcasting invested in &quot;Tokyo 12 Channel Production&quot;, which is a broadcast program production company. Broadcast TV) continued the cross-net station until the net change. After that, Mainichi Broadcasting moved to the TBS affiliation station due to the network change, but from the remnants of the swap era, even after the transition to TBS, Tokyo 12 Channel → Listed as a major shareholder of TV Tokyo, and is still listed in the top 10 major shareholders of TV Tokyo Holdings. Conversely, programs produced by Mainichi Broadcasting were sometimes broadcast on TV Tokyo only in the Kanto region (such as &quot;Fortune Quest L&quot;). Since TXN was officially launched on April 1, 1989, there have been no crossnet stations with other affiliates.

The stations affiliated with TXN are all TV stations.

The TXN network is one of Japan&#x27;s five major commercial networks that does not have a page for breaking news.

== History ==
Tokyo Channel 12 almost went into bankruptcy in 1968. At the time, a television production company was established, with two companies, business newspaper &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; and the Mainichi Broadcasting System having a central role in the investment. At this time, MBS was affiliated to NET TV (now TV Asahi), which carried out a &quot;key station declaration&quot; at the request of Nikkei, in the form of cross-networking with Tokyo Channel 12 and NET, in October 1969. Both channels either signed a network, or launched a co-production program, by, for example, each other to supply the programs from both stations, to strengthen the relationship. However, the relationship involving MBS and Tokyo Channel 12 disappeared on March 31, 1975, when MBS and ABC swapped their affiliations. Tokyo Channel 12 became an independent channel and remained that way until the start of the 80s.

Then, on March 1, 1982, TV Osaka (TVO) became the first affiliate stations of what came to be TV Tokyo&#x27;s network of stations. The new network was named Mega TON Network. Although &quot;Mega TON&quot; initially stood for &quot;Megalopolis Tokyo-Osaka Network&quot;, the &quot;N&quot; also meant Nagoya, where a third station was planned. TV Aichi (TVA) began broadcasting on September 1, 1983. Also, the &quot;Megalopolis Song Festival&quot; was once broadcast featuring the name of the network.

On October 1, 1985, a fourth station covering Okayama and Kagawa (the Setouchi quasi-Wide Area), named TV Setouchi (TSC), started broadcasting. However, the name Mega TON Network continued to be used, as it also meant &quot;T&quot; for Takamatsu and &quot;O&quot; for Okayama, after their respective capitals.

Because of the expansion, the network changed names on April 1, 1989, to TXN Network (TXN). The catchphrase at the time was &quot;Can you feel your hot heartbeat?&quot;. In connection with the changes, the name &quot;TV Tokyo Network&quot; was also used in magazines at the time, but &quot;TXN Network&quot; was also used in TV commercials. At the same time as the birth of the new network, the popular name &quot;TX&quot; was officially established as an abbreviation (derived from TV Tokyo&#x27;s call sign JOTX-TV). At the same time, TV Tokyo gained the TX abbreviation from the station&#x27;s calls. Television Hokkaido in Hokkaido and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting in Fukuoka began broadcasting in 1989 and 1991, respectively. The network gained their current shape of six stations.

== List of stations ==
===Areas without a TXN station===
There is no affiliate in the Tohoku, Hokuriku, Shinetsu, and Okinawa regions. In prefectures without a TXN station, a selection of TV Tokyo programs are syndicated to other stations in the prefecture.

== Expansion plans ==
TXN is difficult to expand nationwide, especially in the seven prefectures of Miyagi, Niigata, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Hiroshima, and Kumamoto, which have ordinance-designated cities, and even now there are no affiliated stations. Also, among the ordinance-designated cities belonging to the seven prefectures mentioned above, TV Tokyo is part of Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, TV Aichi is part of Hamamatsu City, and many areas between Kyoto City, Kobe City, and Hanshin, Hyogo Prefecture. You can receive TV Osaka directly or rebroadcast outside the area, and TV Setouchi can be used for direct reception in the western part of Kobe City, but in other areas it is impossible to receive the broadcasts of TXN affiliated stations.

===5-prefecture expansion plan===
At the president&#x27;s regular press conference on May 31, 2007, the goal was to complete the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting on July 24, 2011:
*Opening a new station in Miyagi Prefecture or expanding the detached area of TV Tokyo
*Opening a new station in Hiroshima Prefecture or expanding the area of TV Setouchi, an existing affiliated station in neighboring prefectures
*Opening a new station in Shizuoka Prefecture or expanding the area of TV Tokyo or TV Aichi, which are affiliated stations in neighboring prefectures
*Expand the broadcasting area of TV Osaka, an existing affiliated station in neighboring prefectures to Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures.
However, this was an example commented by Sadahiko Sugaya, the president of TV Tokyo at the time, and was not officially approved as a business plan.

In an overview of the 40th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on TV Tokyo held on June 20, 2008, the company responded that it was &quot;difficult in the current business environment&quot; regarding the expansion of the area that can be seen, and since then it has not shown any new movements.

===Direct reception and distribution by cable TV===
The 6 TXN affiliated stations are broadcast only in 13 prefectures, but even outside the target area (including some areas that are within the broadcast target area of the TXN affiliated station but are outside the broadcasting area) directly with a para stack antenna etc. Many households are watching TXN affiliated broadcasting stations, by methods such as spillover reception. In Kinki and Tokai, since before the opening of affiliated stations TV Osaka and TV Aichi, there is a mutual network relationship with independent prefectural regional stations in neighboring prefectures, so the consent of the local independent prefectural regional stations could not be obtained. There are stations that do not distribute cable TV due to technical reasons such as difficult reception from relay points, such as Hida in Gifu Prefecture, and Iga and Kumano in Mie Prefecture.

===TX availability status===
TX has the same number of relay stations as NHK and the four leading wide-area commercial broadcasting stations in Tokyo, including the islands of Tokyo. In the Tokyo 12 channel era, there were fewer relay stations than the starting station because there were no latecomers, educational stations, or affiliated stations.

Outside the area, most of Yamanashi Prefecture, a part of the eastern part of Shizuoka Prefecture, almost the eastern half of Nagano Prefecture, a small part of Niigata Prefecture, and a small part of Fukushima Prefecture can receive directly or by relyaing outside the area.

===Kinki area===
TV Osaka exists (broadcasting stations) in a wide area, but only Osaka Prefecture is the service area due to the balance between terrestrial independent TV stations in surrounding prefectures (especially KBS Kyoto and Sun TV) and the four leading wide-area broadcasters. A frequency was assigned as a prefectural broadcasting station. For this reason, there were many areas in Osaka where radio waves from the transmitting station on Mt. Ikoma could not be heard, so multiple independent relay stations were installed in Osaka.

There are areas where it can be received directly or by rebroadcasting outside the area (Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo, Tokushima (designated as a special area)), but Wakayama Prefecture did not obtain the consent of TV Wakayama, It was not received in all areas from the analog era, and Shiga Prefecture was also received in some areas during the analog era, but it was discontinued due to technical problems after the complete abolition of analog broadcasting.

===Chukyo area===
Television Aichi also has a broadcasting station in the wider area, but due to the balance between the surrounding prefecture&#x27;s independent terrestrial television station (Gifu-chan, Mie TV) and the four leading wide-area broadcasting commercial broadcasters, only Aichi Prefecture is the service area. A frequency was assigned as a prefectural broadcasting station. However, the actual viewing area of TV Aichi accounts for 93% (household ratio) of the Chukyo metropolitan area including Aichi Prefecture, as well as part of the Hamamatsu metropolitan area in Shizuoka Prefecture, part of the Ina region in Nagano Prefecture, and very little in Shiga Prefecture. Viewing outside the area is possible in some areas.

===Hokkaido===
Unlike the other four affiliated stations (Hokkaido Broadcasting (TBS affiliate), Sapporo Television Broadcasting (Nippon Television affiliate), Hokkaido Television Broadcasting (TV Asahi affiliate), Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting (Fuji Television affiliate)), the entire east of Hokkaido (Tokachi/Okhotsk), Kushiro and Nemuro) and some other areas did not receive it.

Television Hokkaido opened in October 1989, starting with the central Hokkaido area (parts of Sapporo, Otaru, and Tomakomai), and then starting with parts of Asahikawa, Muroran, and Hakodate (in these areas, terrestrial digital transmission stations and relay stations are It was maintained from 2006 to 2007), and the aim was to establish a prefecture-wide network (development of relay stations = viewing in most of Hokkaido) by 10 years after the opening of the station.

However, due to sluggish sales due to economic deterioration in Hokkaido such as the collapse of the bubble economy, the cost of installing relay stations weighed heavily, and in 1998 the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications at the time decided to shift to terrestrial digital broadcasting. Canceled relay station opening. Even after that, the area expansion did not materialize until 2010, when the system of the &quot;relay station development support project accompanying the transition to terrestrial digital broadcasting&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the support scheme) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications was established. Due to this effect, for example, in Obihiro and Kushiro, before the transmission stations opened in 2011, they were forced to obtain indirect reception via cable television. For this reason, in the program schedules of newspapers published in Hokkaido, in areas where there are no relay stations, there is a warning that TVh cannot be received in some areas.

After that, from August to November 2011 after the complete transition to terrestrial digital broadcasting, transmitting stations in Abashiri, Obihiro and Kushiro (Abashiri Transmitting Station, Obihiro Transmitting Station, Kushiro Transmitting Station), and relay stations in Kitami (Kitami Relay Station). Starting with the opening of the station, the installation of relay stations progressed, and due to the support scheme and the support of local governments in the relay station area, both analog and digital could not be viewed from October to December 2014. Broadcasting began in most areas of the Soya General Promotion Bureau, including Wakkanai, and the Nemuro Promotion Bureau, which had been unviewable until the end, began broadcasting in December 2015 Although some unopened relay stations (Honbetsu and Honbetsuzawa) remain, the entire Hokkaido network has finally been practically completed 26 years after its opening in 1989. Shibecha Rururan in Kushiro also opened on March 31, 2016.

Direct reception is also possible in some areas along the Tsugaru Strait in Aomori Prefecture. Kazamaura Village rebroadcasts digital broadcasts outside the area through the Kazamaura Village Public Listening System. In addition, Aomori Cable TV in Aomori City was rebroadcasting outside the area until the end of broadcasting on July 24, 2011, only for analog broadcasting (transmitting video from Sapporo headquarters via optical fiber line), but March 1, 2016, Started digital rebroadcast for the first time in about four and a half years (for the time being, it will be broadcast in the form of a test broadcast).

===Okayama Prefecture, Kagawa Prefecture, Fukuoka Prefecture===
TV Setouchi and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting also have fewer relay stations than the original stations, so there were many difficult viewing areas within the broadcasting target area for analog broadcasting. However, in 2010 TVQ achieved virtually 100% coverage of the entire Fukuoka prefecture. In addition, since the neighboring Saga Prefecture has only one commercial TV station in the prefecture, Saga TV, it was designated as a special area like Tokushima Prefecture, so all commercial TV stations in Fuku, including TVQ, are on all cable TV stations in the prefecture. We are rebroadcasting outside the area. In addition, it can be viewed directly in western Yamaguchi Prefecture, almost all of Oita Prefecture, and part of Nagasaki Prefecture by direct reception or rebroadcast outside the area. However, in Kumamoto Prefecture, direct reception is possible in a small area such as Arao City, and rebroadcasting outside the area is not performed throughout the area without the consent of the local station.

On the other hand, regarding TV Setouchi, although there are areas where digital broadcasting has started, there are still areas under consideration or not applicable, so it is unclear whether all areas will be covered. However, there are some areas where it is difficult to hear. Unlike TV Hokkaido, the installation of a relay station for a new digital station using support schemes is undecided at this time, except for the Mimasaka relay station that opened on April 20, 2012. However, there are many households that can watch it if it is a cable TV station. In addition, direct reception or rebroadcast outside the area of Cable TV in the Harimanada coast of Hyogo Prefecture, the northern part of Tokushima Prefecture, the Toyo region of Ehime Prefecture, the Bingo region of Hiroshima Prefecture, the majority of Tottori Prefecture, and some areas of eastern Shimane Prefecture [Note 33] It is possible to watch Setouchi on TV.

===Balance between expansion of viewable area and program sales===
As mentioned above, the viewing range of TXN (affiliated stations) is limited, so in areas where there are no affiliated stations, TXN affiliated programs may be broadcast at different times from other affiliated stations in each region due to program sales. It will be broadcast on BS TV Tokyo. Most of the program sales are time-lag broadcasts in consideration of sales destinations outside the TXN affiliated stations, but some live broadcast programs such as news programs and sports broadcasts are simulcast. In addition, due to restrictions on terrestrial digital broadcasting on CATV (in principle prohibiting rebroadcasting outside the area), it is possible that program sales to non-TXN affiliated broadcasting stations, which had been on a downward trend due to that, will increase, so for TXN affiliated stations There is also a point that income from number sales increases and there is a big merit.

However, music (especially enka-related) programs, except for the co-produced program &quot;Enka Hanamichi&quot;, are mostly not broadcast due to rights issues with related organizations, and in recent years, not only music programs but also variety programs. With almost no broadcast, the ratio of terrestrial programs has fallen from the initial 70% to less than 50%, and the ratio of original programs (including joint production with TV Tokyo), foreign dramas, and TV shopping is increasing.

<doc id="981682" wikidata="Q161147" url="?curid=981682" title="Reductio ad Hitlerum">
<text> (Latin for &quot;reduction to Hitler&quot;), also known as playing the Nazi card, is an attempt to invalidate someone else&#x27;s argument on the basis that the same idea was promoted or practised by Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party. Arguments can be termed if they are fallacious (e.g., arguing that because Hitler abstained from eating meat or was against smoking, anyone else who does so is a Nazi). Contrarily, straightforward arguments critiquing specifically fascist components of Nazism like &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; are not part of the association fallacy. 

Invented by Leo Strauss in 1953, takes its name from the term used in logic called (&quot;reduction to the absurdity&quot;). According to Strauss, is a type of , , or a fallacy of irrelevance. The suggested rationale is one of guilt by association. It is a tactic often used to derail arguments because such comparisons tend to distract and anger the opponent.

== Definition ==
 is a type of association fallacy. The argument is that a policy leads to—or is the same as—one advocated or implemented by Adolf Hitler or Nazi Germany and so &quot;proves&quot; that the original policy is undesirable. Another type of is asking a question of the form &quot;You know who else...?&quot; with the deliberate intent of impugning a certain idea or action by implying Hitler had that idea or performed such an action.

A comparison to Hitler or Nazism is not a if it illuminates an argument instead of causing distraction from it. Straightforward comparisons can be used to criticize fascist components of Nazism such as the Führerprinzip. However, one could argue fallaciously that because Hitler abstained from eating meat or was opposed to smoking, anyone else who has these opinions so is a Nazi.

== History ==
The phrase is first known to have been used in an article written by University of Chicago professor Leo Strauss for &quot;Measure: A Critical Journal&quot; in spring 1951, although it was made famous in a book by Strauss published in 1953 &quot;Natural Right and History&quot;, Chapter II:
In following this movement towards its end we shall inevitably reach a point beyond which the scene is darkened by the shadow of Hitler. Unfortunately, it does not go without saying that in our examination we must avoid the fallacy that in the last decades has frequently been used as a substitute for the : the . A view is not refuted by the fact that it happens to have been shared by Hitler.
The phrase was derived from the logical argument termed Reductio ad absurdum. The variant takes its form from the names of many classic fallacies such as . The variant may be further humorously derived from .

== Limits to classification as a fallacy ==
Historian Daniel Goldhagen, who had written about the Holocaust, argues that not all comparisons to Hitler and Nazism are logical fallacies since if they all were, there would be nothing to learn from the events that resulted in the Holocaust. He argues in his book &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot; that many people who were complicit or active participants in the Holocaust and subsequently in fascist and neo-Nazi movements have manipulated the historical narrative to escape blame or to deny aspects of the Holocaust. Claims that allegations of antisemitism are &quot;reductio ad Hitlerum&quot; have also been employed by David Irving, a British Holocaust denier.

In 2000, Thomas Fleming claimed that &quot;reductio ad Hitlerum&quot; was being used by his opponents against his values:

Leo Strauss called it the . If Hitler liked neoclassical art, that means that classicism in every form is Nazi; if Hitler wanted to strengthen the German family, that makes the traditional family (and its defenders) Nazi; if Hitler spoke of the &quot;nation&quot; or the &quot;folk&quot;, then any invocation of nationality, ethnicity, or even folkishness is Nazi ...
== Antecedents ==
Although named for Hitler, the logical fallacy existed before World War II. Other individuals from history were used as stand-ins for evil. Author Tom Holland compares the use of Hitler as the standard of evil with earlier invocations of the Devil (such as the phrase &#x27;Deal with the Devil&#x27;). During the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus was commonly considered the most villainous person in history. During the years prior to the American Civil War, abolitionists referred to enslavers as modern-day Pharaohs. After VE Day, Pharaoh continued to appear in the speeches of social reformers like Martin Luther King Jr. Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate were also commonly held up as pure evil. However, there was no universal Hitler-like person, and different regions and times used different stand-ins. In the years after the American Revolution, King George III was often vilified in the United States. &quot;King George&quot; comparison was publicly used as recently as 1992 by Pat Buchanan when referring to president George H. W. Bush, in the course of the U.S. presidential campaign. During the American Civil War, some Confederates called Lincoln a &quot;modern Pharaoh&quot;.

== Invocations ==
In 1991, Michael André Bernstein alleged over a full-page advertisement placed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by the Lubavitch community after the Crown Heights riot under the heading &quot;This Year &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights&quot;. Henry Schwarzschild, who had witnessed &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;however ugly were the anti-Semitic slogans and the assaultive behavior of people in the streets [during the Crown Heights riots] ... one thing that clearly did not take place was a &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;&quot;.

&quot;The American Conservative&quot; accused Jonah Goldberg&#x27;s book &quot;Liberal Fascism&quot; of employing the fallacy:
That Nazism and contemporary liberalism both promote healthy living is as meaningless a finding as that bloody marys and martinis may both be made with gin. Repeatedly, Goldberg fails to recognize a . ... In no case does Goldberg uncover anything more ominous than a coincidence.

Since Hitler was against smoking, some in the tobacco industry invoked the argument to compare those who are against smoking to Nazis.

<text>Charles A. Zimmermann (1861 – January 16, 1916) was an American composer of marches and popular music. A graduate of the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, he was appointed bandmaster at the United States Naval Academy in 1887 at the age of 26. Zimmermann served as the academy&#x27;s bandmaster until his death from a brain hemorrhage in 1916. Zimmermann is buried at the Naval Academy cemetery.

Zimmermann composed his most famous march, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, in 1906 when he was a lieutenant in the United States Navy. The lyrics were written by Alfred Hart Miles, a midshipman. The march was intended from the beginning to serve as a rousing tune for football games. The familiar strain is actually the trio of the larger work. Zimmermann also composed numerous songs for the 1902 stage play &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

<doc id="981688" wikidata="Q746096" url="?curid=981688" title="North Shields">
<text>North Shields ( ) is a town in the borough of North Tyneside in Tyne and Wear, England. It is north-east of Newcastle upon Tyne and borders nearby Wallsend and Tynemouth. 

Since 1974, it has been in the North Tyneside borough of Tyne and Wear: its historic administration was as part of the Castle ward in county of Northumberland. It was part of the Tynemouth County Borough; when abolished in 1974, the borough became an unparished area.

It is on the northern bank of the River Tyne, opposite to South Shields on the other bank. The name derives from Middle English &quot;schele&quot; meaning &quot;temporary sheds or huts used by fishermen&quot;.

== History ==
=== Earliest records ===
North Shields is first recorded in 1225, when the Prior of Tynemouth, Germanus, decided to create a fishing port to provide fish for the Priory which was situated on the headland at the mouth of the River Tyne. He also supplied ships anchored near the priory. A number of rudimentary houses or &#x27;shiels&#x27; were erected at the mouth of the Pow Burn where the stream enters the Tyne, as well as wooden quays which were used to unload the fishing boats. The quays were also used to ship coal from local collieries owned by the Priory. Soon the population of the new township numbered 1,000. The burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne were determined to preserve the custom rights that they had enjoyed up till then, which covered the whole length of the river. They successfully petitioned the king in 1290 and managed to suspend trade from the new settlement. It was forbidden to victual ships or to load and unload cargoes at North Shields. The opposition of the Newcastle burgesses remained for a considerable time but despite this, North Shields continued to develop as a centre for fishing and exporting salt, produced at local saltpans. For a considerable period the Newcastle burgesses, known as the Hostmen, who controlled the export of coal from the Tyne, resisted the export of this commodity from North Shields.

=== Geographic development ===

The town was originated on a narrow strip of land alongside the river (around the present-day Clive Street) because of the steep bank which hemmed it in. Eventually becoming overcrowded, in the 18th century buildings began to be erected on the plateau above the old unsanitary dwellings alongside the river. Prosperous businessmen and shipowners occupied the new town whereas working people remained in the lower part of town. The low, riverside part of the town was linked to the newer, higher part of the town by a series of stairs. These stairs were initially surrounded by slum dwellings, and although the houses have since been cleared the stairs remain.

One of the first developments of the new town was Dockwray Square, built in 1763, a set of elegant town houses that was populated by wealthy families. Due to the poor provision of water and drainage facilities, however, the wealthy families soon moved to the more central part of the new town, and particularly the new Northumberland Square. Dockwray Square eventually deteriorated into slums. In the early twentieth century Stan Laurel lived at a house in Dockwray Square for a few years, before he became famous. The square has since been re-developed, initially in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s. A statue of Laurel stands in the middle to commemorate his stay there.

The land on which the new town was built was largely owned by the Earl of Carlisle. In 1796, John Wright produced plans that included a grand processional way, now Howard Street, leading to the Georgian Northumberland Square. A railway tunnel, built in the 1840s, left the west and south sides of the square largely unfinished, until a 1960s library building was constructed, somewhat out of keeping with the rest of the architecture. In 1844–45, John Dobson built the town hall, on the corner of Howard and Saville Streets.

==Geography==
The town is bounded to the north by Whitley Bay and to the south by the River Tyne. The town of Tynemouth is to its east and the A19 road marks the boundary between North Shields and Wallsend to the west of the town. It is part of the North Tyneside conurbation.

Over the years, North Shields has grown from a small fishing village to incorporate the nearby areas of Chirton, Preston, Billy Mill, Percy Main, East Howdon and Marden estate.

The 2011 definition of the town of Tynemouth includes North Shields, which means a population figure can only be given as a combination of wards rather than as a USD.
=== Town Centre ===
In September 2020, the North Tyneside Council published prospective plans for regeneration of the town centre, which include developing a distinctive route to the Fish Quay, pedestrianisation of key streets, consolidation of retail units, creation of a town square, renovation of Northumberland Square and the establishment of a transport hub. At the time of publication, the plan was not financed and the council sought the views of local residents and business owners.

In summer 2020, work was being completed on the refurbishment of the terraced row to the north of Northumberland Square, as well as the development of a newly built row of homes on nearby Albion Road. The newly restored Wooden Dolly was also returned to the Square.

A new square, adjacent to Bedford Street, was completed as part of the Transport Hub development in September 2023.

===Meadow Well===
A large council estate, Meadow Well (alternatively spelt Meadowell or Meadowwell on local signs) to the west of the town, was constructed in the 1930s to house residents displaced by the clearance of the Dockwray Square and Low Town slum areas. These flats were replaced with better quality homes in the 1960s and 70s. Meadow Well was formerly known as the Ridges Estate – a name occasionally used today – since it was built on the site of the Ridges farm. Its present name is derived from a well situated in a meadow upon which the estate was built.

On Monday, 9 September 1991, Meadow Well was featured heavily in the news across the UK as riots broke out which continued for three days. Many properties were damaged, cars burned out and the local community centre burned down. As a result of the riots, the local housing was gradually improved by the council over the next three years through demolition and rebuilding, as well as renovation. A number of community development organisations, including the Cedarwood Trust, Meadow Well Connected and the Phoenix Detached Youth Project, have worked in the area for many years.

The film &quot;Dream On&quot; (1991) is set on the estate.

Following the Meadow Well riots, in July 1992 the Government granted £37.5 million over five years to regenerate that area of the town, as part of the City Challenge scheme.

=== Royal Quays ===

An extensive regeneration programme costing £16 million saw the revitalisation of the redundant Albert Edward docks. Across an 80 hectare area, the former Tyne and Wear Development Corporation partnered with North Tyneside Council and the private sector to provide a mix of housing, leisure facilities, office space and industrial sites. The Wet N Wild indoor water park, an outlet shopping centre, a bowling alley, a soccer dome and a marina formed the centrepiece to the Royal Quays development to the west of the town.

Mark di Suvero&#x27;s &quot;Tyne Anew&quot; (1999), his only large-scale public artwork in the UK, can be seen at Albert Edward Dock.

The shopping centre was rebranded by new owners as the Newcastle Quays Retail in early 2024. The centre had declined over a number of years prior to the former owner being placed into administration in 2023.

=== Fish Quay ===
Similarly, major regeneration of the Fish Quay, on the riverside to the south-east of the town centre, has included the construction of luxury apartments and the conversion of existing buildings into restaurants and bars alongside the working quay. In November 2018, North Tyneside Council announced plans for further development to enhance the area as a food and drink destination.

=== Smith&#x27;s Docks ===
The site of the former Smith&#x27;s Docks was acquired by the developer Places For People in 2007. In January 2015 they sought planning permission for the construction of homes on the site. The first of those homes, including some designed by George Clarke, was sold in 2017 and as of April 2018, work continues on the site. The second phase, the Smokehouses, was completed in autumn 2018.

=== Heritage Action Zone ===
Having been awarded £900,000 through the High Street Heritage Action Zone programme, North Tyneside Council plans to add £1 million additional funding to revive the conservation area around Howard Street and Northumberland Square. It will also see work done on the streetscape connecting to the main shopping thoroughfare of Bedford Street in order to better link the areas and decrease the dominance of motor vehicles.

=== Collingwood Grange ===
In 2017, North Tyneside Council granted planning permission for up to 400 new homes on formerly industrial land to the west of Norham Road. In April 2020, the developer, Miller Homes, announced that work had been halted by the Covid-19 pandemic and that plans may be altered as a result. Work on the development recommenced in January 2021.

== Industry ==

===Former===
In 1887, the town&#x27;s businesses were listed as a marine engine, chain cable and anchor manufacturer, shipbuilding yards, roperies, salt-works, and an earthenware and stained glass manufacturer. Fishing was also a major industry of employment. The Smith&#x27;s Dock Company was another major employer for many years, eventually closing in 1987.

==== Shipyards ====
Shipyards have been in existence in North Shields since near its founding. The smaller yards built the Northumbrian coble, a small inshore fishing vessel with a lug sail, well known in the North East. Larger yards built wooden sailing collier brigs, used to transport local coal to London. Eventually these small yards were replaced by larger yards such as the Tyne Dock and Engineering Company and the Smith&#x27;s Dock Company. These yards produced iron vessels for various uses, including fishing and the coal trade. In later years the North Shields yards were used for ship repair work, with Smith&#x27;s dock surviving until the 1990s. None of these yards remain.

==== Oil terminal ====
Esso formerly had an oil terminal on the banks of the Tyne, off Howdon Road. In April 1994, a bomb planted by the IRA exploded tearing a 3-foot square hole in one of the tanks. A second device, which did not detonate, was later found nearby. Six hundred gallons of crude oil leaked from the tank, but was caught in a channel designed to prevent leakages. A second explosion occurred in June 1994, perpetrated by the same bombers.

=== Maritime ===
With its fishing industry and shipbuilding history, a number of maritime related companies remain in the town. John Lilley and Gillie Ltd, a marine equipment manufacturer is headquartered there.

=== Mining ===
Collieries in the town were located at three of the outlying villages since incorporated into the town, at Preston, at the location of the present cemetery gates, Percy Main and New York.

=== Office and business parks ===
Following the demise of coal mining and shipbuilding in the area, several business parks, industrial estates and trading estates were established providing alternative employment. The biggest of these are The Silverlink and Cobalt Park, the UK&#x27;s largest office park. Atmel had a plant located at Silverlink, previously occupied by Siemens but the plant is now demolished apart from the office building, now home to Cobalt Business Exchange. Cobalt is home to an EE mobile call centre. The town&#x27;s association with the early days of the railways is recognised at the Stephenson Railway Museum on Middle Engine Lane near The Silverlink.

=== Other industries ===
Potts Print, based in Cramlington since 2006, was originally founded in North Shields in 1875. They occupied various sites in the town over the years.

Spicers has a large factory in the town, producing tea. It bought the site from Twinings in 2012.

Donald Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Bluebird K7&quot;, which crashed during a water speed record attempt on Coniston Water, was restored in a workshop in the town by local engineer Bill Smith.

==Transport==

===Rail (Tyne and Wear Metro)===
The Newcastle and North Shields Railway opened in 1839. In 1847, the railway was extended to Tynemouth when a railway station was built in Oxford Street, off Tynemouth Road. Eventually, it was replaced by a new station further away from the river after new rail lines were developed. The riverside tracks were removed for the creation of &quot;Hadrian&#x27;s Way&quot;, part of the national cycle network, but the remaining tracks were absorbed in the Tyne and Wear Metro system in 1982.
The town centre station, originally constructed for the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, was redeveloped between 1980 and 1982 for the Metro. It was subsequently refurbished in 2012.
The Tyne and Wear Metro links North Shields to Newcastle city centre, and to other destinations in Tyne and Wear including Whitley Bay, Newcastle Airport and Sunderland.
The town is also served by stations in Percy Main and Meadow Well.

The Tyneside Tramways and Tramroads Company also operated an electric tramway service in the town.

===Shipping===
====Local ferry====
A half-hourly ferry service connects North Shields to the town of South Shields on the opposite bank of the Tyne. The present Shields Ferry was established in 1972. Its first female skipper was appointed in 2016. &quot;Shieldsman&quot;, a former ferry retired in 2007, has since been moved to Shoreham, West Sussex, and transformed into a houseboat.

From June to October, river trips by ferry operate.

In November 2018, the local council announced plans to consider the feasibility of moving the ferry landing. In July 2021 it was announced that the planned relocation was delayed until 2023.

====International ferry====
From the International Ferry Terminal, based at Royal Quays, the Danish company DFDS Seaways operates a daily service to IJmuiden.

The ferry service to Gothenburg, Sweden (run by DFDS Seaways), ceased operation at the end of October 2006. DFDS Seaways&#x27; sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled freight ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, including Newcastle, but these have limited capacity for passengers and do not carry private vehicles.

==== Port of Tyne International Passenger Terminal ====
The passenger terminal regularly welcomes tourists travelling on cruises that call at North Shields as an access point for Newcastle upon Tyne and the wider North East of England. In 2017, 52 ships docked, bringing 120,000 visitors to the region. A number of &quot;dudes&quot; - red and blue powder coated figures designed by artist Perminder Kaur - can be seen on a grassy mound at the entrance to the terminal.

=== Buses ===
A transport interchange, adjacent to the Metro station, opened in September 2023. It was the first council building in the borough to be fully carbon-neutral in its construction and operation.

== Education ==
The town&#x27;s schools are part of a three-tiered system:

* Nursery schools
** Sir James Knott Nursery School
* Primary schools
** Christ Church Church of England Primary School
** Collingwood Primary School
** King Edward Primary School

==Religion==
North Shields has a number of churches and religious groups:

===Christian churches===

Many are members of the ecumenical Churches Together in North Shields, itself a member of Churches Together in England.

==== Other organisations ====

*North Shields Fishermen&#x27;s Mission, 42-47 Fish Quay - Based in North Shields, the organisation covers the North East coast from Amble to Redcar.

== Economy ==

===Culture===
In 2009, seating inspired by Plasticine, the inventor of which was born in North Shields, was installed on Bedford Street in the town centre. The seats proved unpopular as their shape prevented rainwater draining off, so they were replaced by more traditional metal benches and moved to the Royal Quays Marina in 2011.

==== YMCA ====
YMCA North Tyneside was founded in 1870 and was originally known as The Borough of Tynemouth YMCA. After an inaugural meeting on 7 June 1879, weekly meetings followed in the Sons of Temperance Hall, Norfolk Street, North Shields. The YMCA grew in popularity. Within a year, larger premises were needed. Meetings moved to 53 Tyne Street, North Shields and in 1879 to Camden Street, North Shields. In 1920 the YMCA moved to a building in Bedford Street (which is still owned by the YMCA and now occupied by the Citizens Advice Bureau) where it remained until 1938, when it moved to the present building and the current registered office at Church Way, North Shields.

==== Fish Quay Festival ====
Between 1987 and 2001, a community festival was organised on the fish quay, during which the fleet of fishing boats would be blessed and various local talents would entertain the crowds. At its peak, the festival attracted 600,000 visitors. A smaller-scale family festival, in order to save costs, was held annually between 2002 and 2006, before it too was scrapped as a money-saving measure.

=== Retail ===

==== Town Centre ====
A significant part of the town centre is pedestrianised and it is dominated by the Beacon, a partly-covered shopping mall which was constructed in the late 1970s and originally named The Bedford Centre.

As with many British high streets, a number of large chains have closed their branches in the town in recent years, including Littlewoods, Woolworths and McDonald&#x27;s. As of 2019, Wilko has a large store in the Beacon, alongside high street regulars such as Specsavers, Superdrug and Boots. A number of discount retailers including B &amp; M, Home Bargains, Peacocks and Heron Foods have branches in the town centre, as well as numerous charity stores.

Greggs, Cooplands, and Costa Coffee have outlets. Charities YMCA North Tyneside, Age UK and Operation Veteran both have independent coffee shops. Barista Boho, opened in 2022 in the former Alnwick Castle public house, also serves local coffee blends and hosts musicians. There are numerous independent butchers in the town centre, as well as a local independent bakery, Canatrice, located nearby.

Asda acquired a former Netto store in the town centre in 2011. The Co-op has a number of branches in the town, including convenience stores in Tynemouth and Preston. Morrisons also has a large store in Preston.

==== Other shopping centres ====
There are three further shopping centres in the town, as well as parades of shops in Balkwell, Preston and Chirton.

The Royal Quays Outlet Centre is home to a number of discount stores including outlets for Next, Clarks and Mountain Warehouse, as well as independent retailers such as a photographic studio and pet shop. The closures of a Marks &amp; Spencer Outlet and, in late 2019, the Nike store have somewhat diminished the centre. In April 2023, it was reported that the centre&#x27;s owners had appointed receivers who were advertising it for sale as a going concern. It remains open as usual.

The Coast Road Retail Park is adjacent to a large Tesco supermarket and, as of 2020, home to Dunelm, B &amp; M, Pets at Home, Carpetright and The Food Warehouse stores.

The Silverlink Shopping Park, as of 2020, includes branches of Boots, Next, H&amp;M, Halfords, Marks and Spencer and River Island. In September 2016, a large expansion of the retail park opened. Odeon also has a multi-screen cinema at the park, alongside restaurants.

=== Business ===
Over 100 businesses in the town are members of The North Shields Chamber of Trade and Commerce.

The Mercantile Building Society, established in the town and formerly headquartered at the Silverlink Business Park, merged with the Leeds Building Society in 2006.

==Recreation==
In 2000, the local authority established more than of walking routes, primarily following the paths of 19th-century waggonways. A Tynemouth walk begins from the Metro station in the town centre and drops down on to the fish quay before following a route to Tynemouth, while the Royal Quays walk begins from the Meadowell Metro station and completes a route around the redeveloped riverside area including the marina, before ending at Percy Main Metro station.

=== Sport ===
The town is home to the non-League football club North Shields F.C. Founded in 1896, the team competes in Northern Football League and plays home games at Daren Persson Stadium (formerly Ralph Gardner Park). The team has twice played at Wembley Stadium, winning 2–1 on both occasions: against Sutton United on 12 April 1969 at the old Wembley to win the FA Amateur Cup and against Glossop North End at the new stadium on 9 May 2015 to win the FA Vase, the Amateur Cup&#x27;s successor. The stadium is presently named as such because of a sponsorship by a local funeral director.

=== Leisure facilities ===
The Parks Sports Centre was opened in 1998, after the construction of the Royal Quays. It has a large sports hall, gym, multi-sensory room, outdoor football pitches, indoor and outdoor bowls facilities and a cafe.

==== Royal Quays facilities ====
The Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild indoor water park was constructed in 1992 and opened in summer 1993 as part of the Royal Quays development. It was originally designed with rides: six speed slides, five conventional flumes and one &quot;lazy river&quot; ride. The &quot;Twister&quot;, a speed slide, was long, and started from a height of . It closed in 2013 after its owner entered administration, but was reopened in 2014, having been bought by another company. In 2020, the owner announced that it would not reopen after the winter, citing financial losses due to poor visitor numbers.

A bowling alley, originally Star Bowl, also forms part of the development. In 2019, having been closed for some time, it was reopened as Gutterball.

A trampoline park, Xtreme Bounce, was opened in 2017 in an air-locked dome in the outlet centre&#x27;s car park. In 2019, the Inflatanation chain took over the site and reopened the venue with inflatables replacing the trampolines.

In 2019, a leisure hub housed in the health and fitness section of the former JJB Soccerdome adjacent to the outlet centre, was announced. Everyone Entertained was to feature climbing walls, soft play, laser tag and adventure golf, and employ 100 people. As of May 2020, the venue remains unopened. The pitches and bar were reopened as The Evolution Football Centre in autumn 2018. In early 2020, it was announced that the centre was to close having proved financially nonviable.

==== Parks ====
There are a number of parks and play areas in the town.

===== Northumberland Park =====
Northumberland Park lies on the border of North Shields and Tynemouth and was set out around 1885, in an area formerly known as Spittal Dene. In 2015, North Tyneside Council completed a major project to revive and restore parts of the park. The multi-million pound scheme saw archaeological investigations carried out around the medieval St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital and the restoration historical features that had been lost over the years. Iron railings, park furniture, fountains were installed amid historic planting schemes. A pavilion housing a cafe and toilet facilities as well as offices and storage for the park staff was also opened.

There is a children&#x27;s play area at the south end of the park, bowling greens on the western border and a historical pet cemetery to the north. A number of trees along a pathway in the northern half feature plaques commemorating their planting by various local dignitaries.

===== West End Park and Linear Park, Chirton Dene =====
West End Park lies adjacent to The Parks sports centre and was laid out prior to the 1940s. To its south, Linear Park runs down to the Royal Quays Marina and was created as part of the Royal Quays development in the mid-1990s.

===== Redburn Dene =====
As with Linear Park, Redburn Dene was created as part of the 1990s redevelopment of former industrial and dockland areas, following a natural water course. It features sculptures made from reclaimed staithes. The park was given a Green Flag award in 2020.

===== Play areas =====
Pearson Park located to the east of the town centre was laid in 2000, as a millennium project. Alexander Scott Park is to the east of the town centre. The Holmlands playsite lies within Haswell Gardens, an estate developed on the site of the former Preston Hospital. A further playsite and multi-use games area (MUGA) are adjacent to Norham High School. In Percy Main, a playground lies just off Nelson Terrace. East Howdon has a playsite and MUGA too. There is a playground adjacent to Tynemouth Pool. Finally, there is a further playsite on Tynemouth&#x27;s sea front.

=== Library ===
The town&#x27;s main library is in Northumberland Square. It originally included a lecture hall, which was expected to be used for musical performances too. Construction began in 1973, and the building is mounted on rubber springs to minimize noise and vibration from the Metro tunnel underneath. It was the first building to use PTFE to reduce weight drag on horizontal restraints. The library was refurbished in 2013, with the lecture hall redeveloped for additional book storage and computer workstation capacity.

== Governance ==

North Shields was formerly a township in the parish of Tynemouth, in 1866 North Shields became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1908 the parish was abolished and merged with Tynemouth. In 1901 the parish had a population of 5737.

Since April 1974, North Shields has been part of the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside, formerly having been part of the County Borough of Tynemouth, which was based at Tynemouth Town Hall, in Howard Street, North Shields. Parts of the town are within the Tynemouth and North Tyneside parliamentary constituencies.

North Shields County Court and North Tyneside Magistrates&#x27; Court are also in the town. The county court houses the Employment Tribunals Office.

== Culture ==

=== Art ===
&quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot;, a steel sculpture that serves as a memorial to fishermen lost at sea, was unveiled in 2017.

A number of pieces were installed as part of the Royal Quays development. Located in Chirton Dene, Redburn Dene, by the marina, and near the shopping outlet, they include works by Richard Broderick, Graham Robinson, Linda France, Alec Peever, Gilly Rogers, Mark di Suvero, Perminder Kaur and Andy Plant.

=== In film ===
&quot;Dream On&quot; (1991) was produced by Amber Films and filmed on location in Meadow Well. Its original release was around the time of the Meadow Well riots.

=== On television ===
The BBC series &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;, though set in the fictional Gallowshield, was essentially set in North Shields and filmed on location around the town. Various episodes of the series &quot;Spender&quot;, which starred Jimmy Nail, and &quot;Vera&quot;, with Brenda Blethyn, were also filmed there.

=== In songs ===
Sweden&#x27;s foremost troubadour of the 20th century, Evert Taube, wrote the song &quot;Mary Strand&quot;, which is set in North Shields in 1909. Mary Strand is the proprietress of the cigar shop Tiger Brand on Dock Street and hides a young sailor from the police. The song is based on Taube&#x27;s own experience, when he ran away from the steamship &quot;Australic&quot; in Newcastle upon Tyne.

=== Twin town ===
In 2017, the town was twinned with Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales, as part of the Carnegie Twin Towns Project. The project aimed to pair towns that had similar characteristics, and socio-economic challenges, in order to consider how they might make positive changes to their communities.
==Media==

==Landmarks==
=== Lights of North Shields ===
Because of the difficulty of navigating ships into the mouth of the river past the dangerous Black Midden rocks, buildings were erected in the 16th century with permanent lights burning to be used as a guide by the mariners. High and Low lights are pictured on a 1655 map of the river Tyne: a pair of square castellated towers. Both lights were rebuilt in 1727, and these buildings still stand today (albeit the Old Low Light was remodelled in 1830 to serve as an almshouse). In 1810, the Old Lights were replaced by new High and Low Lights, placed respectively at the top and bottom of the steep bank alongside the river. All these lights were owned and operated by Trinity House of Newcastle-upon-Tyne until they ceased operation. Today, the Old High Beacon, as well as the High and Low Lights, are private residences; they remain prominent landmarks. In 2014 the black-painted Old Low Light was opened to the public following a substantial refurbishment; it contains a café, shop, museum, viewing platform and event space.

=== Fish Quay ===
In 1806, a market place was opened on New Quay. In 1870, work began on constructing a fish quay to provide shelter for the docked fishing boats. This quay is still in use today.
In 2017, a sculpture by artist Ray Lonsdale of a lone fisherman – made of corten steel and weighing over 2 tonnes – was installed on the quay.

=== Clifford&#x27;s Fort ===
Clifford&#x27;s Fort, located on the Fish Quay, was built in the 17th century as a coastal defence against the Dutch. The Fort was active during the Napoleonic Wars and played a significant role during World War I, being the birthplace of the Tyne Electrical Engineers. The fort was officially evacuated by the military in May 1928, sold to the Tynemouth Corporation, and redeveloped as new fish processing facilities. Very little now remains of the original fort buildings, though the walls are intact. The area has undergone considerable restoration, with most of the fish processing units demolished. The remaining excellent modern retail units are very popular. During restoration work, part of the foundations of the 18th century Master Gunner&#x27;s House (demolished in 1973) were found below the concrete floor of a fish processing unit. Elsewhere on the site, part of the stone edging of Cable Tanks belonging to the Submarine Mining Depot, established at the fort in 1888, was uncovered. The gun embrasures have been revealed, the ground resurfaced, and there are some traffic restrictions. The Old Low Light, built in 1735 and Grade II-listed, within Clifford’s Fort, has been restored and operates as a Heritage Centre, café, and community space.

=== Wooden Dolly ===
One of North Shields&#x27; oldest landmarks is the &quot;Wooden Dolly&quot; statue. In 1814, the female figurehead of a collier brig was placed at the entrance to Custom House Quay, on Liddell Street, and stood there until 1850, when it was vandalised. A second figurehead was placed on the same spot. The &quot;Wooden Dolly&quot;, as the figurehead was known, was used by seafarers as a source of good-luck charms, by cutting pieces of wood from her to be taken with them on voyages. Eventually the figurehead was defaced beyond repair and after 14 years was replaced by Wooden Dolly No. 3. This remained until 1901 when it was replaced with Wooden Dolly No. 4 in the shape of a fishwife. A fifth Wooden Dolly, also a fishwife, was placed in Northumberland Square in 1958 and was removed for restoration in December 2019. Once restoration has been completed it will be placed in the Library and a replacement figure installed in the square. In 1992, a sixth Wooden Dolly was placed where the first four had been, at the entrance to Custom House Quay, and can still be seen there, next to the Prince of Wales public house.

==Notable people==
Prominent locals include Ralph Gardner, who opposed Newcastle when it attempted to prevent the docking of coal ships in North Shields. Gardner was imprisoned in 1653 for refusing to close his brewery which supplied provisions to the ships. In 1655, he petitioned Parliament against what he claimed were the unfair demands of Newcastle. Gardner, regarded as a local hero, had a High School named in his honour in 1933 near the former site of his cottage. The school, nicknamed &#x27;Ralphies&#x27; by its students closed in 1994 and was redeveloped into the Gardner Park housing estate. A monument to Gardner was erected near the school.

The family of Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood (1748–1810), a notable naval commander, and Edward Collingwood (1734–1806), a barrister who ordered the construction of Dissington Hall, had their seat at Chirton Hall in Chirton, now a western suburb of North Shields. The Collingwood Arms, a public house, was later built on part of that land before being demolished in early 2005 to make way for a retirement home.

<doc id="981691" wikidata="Q1002183" url="?curid=981691" title="Cashel, County Tipperary">
<text>Cashel (; ) is a town in County Tipperary in Ireland. Its population was 4,422 in the 2016 census. The town gives its name to the ecclesiastical province of &quot;Cashel&quot;. Additionally, the &quot;cathedra&quot; of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly was originally in the town prior to the English Reformation. It is part of the parish of Cashel and Rosegreen in the same archdiocese. One of the six cathedrals of the Anglican Bishop of Cashel and Ossory, who currently resides in Kilkenny, is located in the town. It is in the civil parish of St. Patricksrock which is in the historical barony of Middle Third.

==Location and access==
The town is situated in the Golden Vale, an area of rolling pastureland in the province of Munster.

===Roads===
It is located off the M8 Dublin to Cork motorway. Prior to the construction of the motorway by-pass (in 2004), the town was noted as a bottleneck on the N8 Dublin to Cork route.

===Bus services===
Bus Éireann operates a service (route 245X) between Dublin and Cork which calls at Cashel. Bus Éireann route 128X provides a link to Portlaoise via Urlingford. The Shamrock Bus Company operates a Thurles to Clonmel route via Cashel.

===Rail services===
Cashel used to be served by a railway, the Cashel spur line, which is now closed. The nearest railway station is Cahir, 17 kilometers away. This station is on an infrequently serviced line, but is useful if travelling east to/from Waterford. The most convenient and frequently serviced rail station for Cashel is Thurles as this is on the Dublin-Cork InterCity rail line.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The Rock of Cashel, to which the town below owes its origin, is an isolated elevation of stratified limestone, rising abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the Golden Vale. The top of this eminence is crowned by a group of remarkable ruins. Originally known as Fairy Hill, or Sid-Druim, the Rock was, in pagan times, the &quot;dun&quot;, or castle, of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic, &quot;Caiseal&quot; denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of several places in Ireland. The &quot;Book of Rights&quot; suggests the name is derived from &quot;Cais-il&quot;, i.e. &quot;tribute stone&quot;, because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. Here Corc, grandfather of Aengus Mac Natfraich, erected a fort. Cashel subsequently became the capital of Munster and, like Tara and Armagh, it was a celebrated court. At the time of St. Patrick, when Aengus ruled as king, Cashel claimed supremacy over all the royal duns of the province.

In the 5th century, the Eóganachta dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. Saint Patrick is believed to have baptised Cashel&#x27;s third king, Aengus. In 977 the Dál gCais usurper, Brian Boru, was crowned here as the first non-Eóghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years. In 1101 his great-grandson, King Muirchertach Ua Briain, gave the place to the bishop of Limerick, thus denying it forever to the MacCarthys, the senior branch of the Eóganachta. The bishops had a famous school in Cashel and sent priests all over the continent, especially to Regensburg in Germany, where they maintained their own monastery, called Scots Monastery.

===Lordship of Ireland===
The Synod of Cashel of 1172 was organised by Henry II of England. The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the Roman Rite. It has been suggested that the seventh act of the Synod called upon the clergy and people of Ireland to acknowledge Henry II of England as their king. However, a careful reading of the seventh act would not support this interpretation. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the King&#x27;s purpose in requiring the convocation was to overawe the Irish clergy with a display of his power; no doubt he succeeded in this. In this scenario, the convocation would be viewed as a pretext for the show of strength.

St. Dominic&#x27;s Abbey, a Dominican monastery, was established in 1243.
On 30 December 1640, Cashel was captured by an Irish force under Pilib Ó Dubhuir (died 1648) of Dundrum and his brother Donnchadh Ó Dubhuir (hanged in 1652). They took prisoner 300 members of the English garrison and inhabitants. The following day, 15 prisoners were killed as revenge for earlier atrocities against the Irish; however, this was against Ó Dubhuir&#x27;s orders. In 1647, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the town was stormed and sacked by English Parliamentarian troops under the 6th Baron Inchiquin (later created the 1st Earl of Inchiquin). Over 1,000 Irish Catholic soldiers and civilians, including several prominent clerics, were killed in the attack and ensuing massacre.

===Ecclesiastical history===

About 450, Saint Patrick preached at the royal &quot;dun&quot; and converted king Aengus. The &quot;Tripartite Life&quot; of the saint relates that while &quot;he was baptising Aengus the spike of the crozier went through the foot of the King&quot; who bore with the painful wound in the belief &quot;that it was a rite of the Faith&quot;. According to the same authority, twenty-seven kings of the race of Aengus and his brother Aillil ruled in Cashel until 897, when Cerm-gecan was slain in battle. There is no evidence that St Patrick founded a church at Cashel, or appointed a Bishop of Cashel. St Ailbe, it is supposed, had already fixed his see at Emly, not far off, and within the king&#x27;s dominions. Cashel continued to be the chief residence of the Kings of Munster until 1100, hence its title, &quot;City of the Kings&quot;. Before that date, there was no mention in the native annals of any Bishop, or Archbishop of Cashel. Cormac MacCullinan is referred to, but not correctly, as Archbishop of Cashel, by later writers. He was a bishop, but not of Cashel, where he was king. The most famous man in Ireland of his time, but more of a scholar and warrior than an ecclesiastic, Cormac has left us a glossary of Irish names, which displays his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the &quot;Psalter of Cashel&quot;, a work treating of the history and antiquities of Ireland. He was slain in 903, in a great battle near Carlow.

Brian Boru (Old Irish: &quot;Brian Bóruma&quot;) fortified Cashel in 990. Murtagh O&#x27;Brien, King of Cashel, in presence of the chiefs and clergy, made a grant in 1101 of the &quot;Rock&quot; with the territory around it to O&#x27;Dunan, &quot;noble bishop and chief senior of Munster&quot;, and dedicated it to God and St. Patrick. Then Cashel became an archiepiscopal see, and O&#x27;Dunan its first prelate as far as the primate, St. Celsus, could appoint him. At the synod of Kells, 1152, Cardinal Paparo gave a pallium to Donat O&#x27;Lonergan of Cashel, and since then his successors have ruled the ecclesiastical province of Munster. In 1127 Cormac III of Munster, King of Desmond, erected close to his palace on the &quot;Rock&quot; a church, now known as Cormac&#x27;s Chapel, which was consecrated in 1134, when a synod was held within its walls. During the episcopate of Donal O&#x27;Hullican (1158–1182), the King of Limerick, Domnall O&#x27;Brien, built in 1169 a more spacious church beside Cormac&#x27;s Chapel, which then became a chapterhouse.

Maurice, a Geraldine, filled the see from 1504 to 1523, and was succeeded by Edmund Butler, prior of Athassal Abbey, who was a natural son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond. In addition to the wars between the Irish and the English there arose a new element of discord, the Anglican Reformation introduced by Henry VIII Tudor. While residing at Kilmeaden Castle Archbishop Butler levied black-mail on the traders of the Suir, robbing their boats and holding their persons for ransom. At a session of the royal privy council held at Clonmel in 1539, he swore to uphold the spiritual supremacy of the king and denied the power in Ireland of the Bishop of Rome. He died 1550 and was buried in the cathedral.

=== Post Reformation ===
Roland, a Geraldine (1553–1561), was created Archbishop by the Roman Catholic Church at the recommendation of Queen Mary. After a vacancy of six years, Maurice FitzGibbon (1567–1578), a Cistercian abbot, was promoted to the archbishopric by Pope Pius V, but James MacCaghwell (McCawell) was put forward by Elizabeth I of England. Thus began the Anglican religion at Cashel. FitzGibbon, who belonged to the royal Desmond family, being deprived of his see, fled to France and passed into Spain where he resided for a time at the Court. He conferred with the English ambassador at Paris to obtain pardon for leaving the country without the Queen&#x27;s sanction, and to get permission to return. In this he failed, and going back to Ireland secretly he was arrested and imprisoned at Cork, where he died in 1578. On the death of MacCaghwell, Elizabeth advanced Miler MacGrath, a Franciscan and Bishop of Down, to the See of Cashel. He held at the same time four bishoprics and several benefices, out of which he provided for his numerous offspring. Having occupied the see for fifty-two years, he died in 1622. His monument in the ruined cathedral bears an epitaph written by himself.

Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, or Diarmaid Ó hUrthuile, of Limerick, a distinguished student of the university of Louvain in the Duchy of Brabant and professor at Reims in France, was appointed Archbishop of Cashel in 1581 by Pope Gregory XIII. Having presided over the Roman Catholic diocese secretly for two years, he was discovered and brought before the Lord Justices at Dublin, was tortured upon his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy to the English crown and was subsequently hanged outside the city on 20 June 1584.

Following his killing by a relative c. 1724, the severed head of Rapparee and local folk hero Éamonn an Chnoic was displayed spiked upon Cashel Gaol until some local men removed it and gave the head to O&#x27;Ryan&#x27;s sister, who arranged for a Catholic burial.
Dr Butler 2nd (1774–1791), on being appointed to the Roman Catholic diocese, settled in Thurles, where the Roman Catholic archbishops since then have resided. His successor, Archbishop Bray (1792–1820), built a large church in the early part of the 19th century, on the site of which Archbishop Patrick Leahy (1857–1874) erected a splendid cathedral in Romanesque style. It was completed and consecrated in 1879 by Archbishop Croke (1874–1902) and dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption.

St Albert (feast 8 January), a reputed former bishop, is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic diocese. The Archbishop of Cashel is Administrator of the ancient Diocese of Emly.

The Anglican archbishopric was reduced in status by legislation of 1833 and the bishopric combined initially with Waterford. Today the Church of Ireland, Cashel Union of Parishes is part of The Diocese of Cashel, Ferns and Ossory

==Tourism==
The Rock of Cashel is now one of Ireland&#x27;s most popular tourist sites. The town has several other attractions, including the Bolton Library.

Cashel Town Hall, which accommodates the Heritage Centre and Tourist Office, on Main Street displays a model of Cashel in the 1640s and a multimedia presentation in several languages, and sells Tipperary crafts. The charters granted by kings Charles II (1663) and James II (1687) are on display in the Heritage Centre.

The Georgian Cathedral Church of St John the Baptist and St Patrick&#x27;s Rock on John Street (which replaced that on the Rock in the 18th century) and its adjacent Chapter House (which housed the Bolton Library from the 1980s till the 2000s), city walls, and the former Deanery. The former Church of Ireland Archbishop&#x27;s palace re-opened as a hotel in 2022.

St. Dominic&#x27;s Abbey&#x27;s ruins are visible southeast of the Rock.

The Cashel Folk Village includes replica displays of country life in early Ireland, including an old public house, a butcher&#x27;s shop, a farmhouse, a Traveller&#x27;s caravan, and a chapel. It also includes republican monuments commemorating Tipperary&#x27;s role in the Anglo-Irish War and Irish Civil War.

A street in Christchurch, New Zealand, is named after the bishopric.
