<text>An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes. It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming. Monte Carlo methods are used to understand the stochasticity of these models. Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called individual-based models (IBMs). A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used in many scientific domains including biology, ecology and social science. Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of [[multi-agent system]]s or multi-agent simulation in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.

Agent-based models are a kind of microscale model that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of emergence, which some express as &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. In other words, higher-level system properties emerge from the interactions of lower-level subsystems. Or, macro-scale state changes emerge from micro-scale agent behaviors. Or, simple behaviors (meaning rules followed by agents) generate complex behaviors (meaning state changes at the whole system level).

Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status, using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience &quot;learning&quot;, adaptation, and reproduction.

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as computer simulations, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system&#x27;s emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine, a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device von Neumann proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann&#x27;s friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed cellular automata.
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician John Conway. He constructed the well-known Game of Life. Unlike von Neumann&#x27;s machine, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard.

The Simula programming language, developed in the mid 1960s and widely implemented by the early 1970s, was the first framework for automating step-by-step agent simulations.

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was Thomas Schelling&#x27;s segregation model, which was discussed in his paper &quot;Dynamic Models of Segregation&quot; in 1971. Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the late 1970s, Paulien Hogeweg and Bruce Hesper began experimenting with individual models of ecology. One of their first results was to show that the social structure of bumble-bee colonies emerged as a result of simple rules that govern the behaviour of individual bees. 
They introduced the ToDo principle, referring to the way agents &quot;do what there is to do&quot; at any given time. 

In the early 1980s, Robert Axelrod hosted a tournament of Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner. Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from ethnocentrism to the dissemination of culture.
By the late 1980s, Craig Reynolds&#x27; work on flocking models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton.

The first use of the word &quot;agent&quot; and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down. One candidate appears to be John Holland and John H. Miller&#x27;s 1991 paper &quot;Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory&quot;, based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs. A stronger and earlier candidate is Allan Newell, who in the first Presidential Address of AAAI (published as The Knowledge Level) discussed intelligent agents as a concept.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT). This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, Sugarscape, developed by
Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture. Other notable 1990s developments included Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Kathleen Carley ABM, to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture. The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) was important in encouraging the development of the ABM modeling platform Swarm under the leadership of Christopher Langton. Research conducted through SFI allowed the expansion of ABM techniques to a number of fields including study of the social and spatial dynamics of small-scale human societies and primates. During this 1990s timeframe Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the &quot;Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation&quot; (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal &quot;Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling&quot; (CASM).

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks. CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling. Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history, and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form INFORMS, and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS). Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining National Science Foundation funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS. She was succeeded by David Sallach of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, and then by Michael Prietula of Emory University. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized. As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally. The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006. The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with George Mason University taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s===

More recently, Ron Sun developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as cognitive social simulation. Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at UCLA have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making. Since 1991, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.

=== 2020 and later ===
After the advent of large language models, researchers began applying interacting language models to agent based modeling. In one widely cited paper, agentic language models interacted in a sandbox environment to perform activities like planning birthday parties and holding elections. 

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in equilibrium or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior. The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, emergence, and complexity.

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity. Typically agents are
situated in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in algorithmic form in computer programs. In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful. In ecological ABM (often referred to as &quot;individual-based models&quot; in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in a forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be &quot;purposeful&quot; in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as inductive. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents&#x27; interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, power-law distributions in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system&#x27;s robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

===Framework===
Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models. describe a framework consisting of four levels of developing models of complex adaptive systems described using several example multidisciplinary case studies:
# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.
# Validated agent-based modeling using Virtual Overlay Multiagent system (VOMAS) for the development of verified and validated models in a formal manner.
Other methods of describing agent-based models include code templates and text-based methods such as the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Design Details) protocol.

The role of the environment where agents live, both macro and micro, is also becoming an important factor in agent-based modelling and simulation work. Simple environment affords simple agents, but complex environments generate diversity of behavior.

===Multi-scale modelling===
One strength of agent-based modelling is its ability to mediate information flow between scales. When additional details about an agent are needed, a researcher can integrate it with models describing the extra details. When one is interested in the emergent behaviours demonstrated by the agent population, they can combine the agent-based model with a continuum model describing population dynamics. For example, in a study about CD4+ T cells (a key cell type in the adaptive immune system), the researchers modelled biological phenomena occurring at different spatial (intracellular, cellular, and systemic), temporal, and organizational scales (signal transduction, gene regulation, metabolism, cellular behaviors, and cytokine transport). In the resulting modular model, signal transduction and gene regulation are described by a logical model, metabolism by constraint-based models, cell population dynamics are described by an agent-based model, and systemic cytokine concentrations by ordinary differential equations. In this multi-scale model, the agent-based model occupies the central place and orchestrates every stream of information flow between scales.

==Applications==

===In biology===
Agent-based modeling has been used extensively in biology, including the analysis of the spread of epidemics, and the threat of biowarfare, biological applications including population dynamics, stochastic gene expression, plant-animal interactions, vegetation ecology, migratory ecology, landscape diversity, sociobiology, the growth and decline of ancient civilizations, evolution of ethnocentric behavior, forced displacement/migration, language choice dynamics, cognitive modeling, and biomedical applications including modeling 3D breast tissue formation/morphogenesis, the effects of ionizing radiation on mammary stem cell subpopulation dynamics, inflammation,
and the human immune system, and the evolution of foraging behaviors. Agent-based models have also been used for developing decision support systems such as for breast cancer. Agent-based models are increasingly being used to model pharmacological systems in early stage and pre-clinical research to aid in drug development and gain insights into biological systems that would not be possible &quot;a priori&quot;. Military applications have also been evaluated. Moreover, agent-based models have been recently employed to study molecular-level biological systems. Agent-based models have also been written to describe ecological processes at work in ancient systems, such as those in dinosaur environments and more recent ancient systems as well.

=== In epidemiology ===
Agent-based models now complement traditional compartmental models, the usual type of epidemiological models. ABMs have been shown to be superior to compartmental models in regard to the accuracy of predictions. Recently, ABMs such as CovidSim by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, have been used to inform public health (nonpharmaceutical) interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiological ABMs have been criticized for simplifying and unrealistic assumptions. Still, they can be useful in informing decisions regarding mitigation and suppression measures in cases when ABMs are accurately calibrated. The ABMs for such simulations are mostly based on synthetic populations, since the data of the actual population is not always available.

===In business, technology and network theory===

Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include marketing, organizational behaviour and cognition, team working, supply chain optimization and logistics, modeling of consumer behavior, including word of mouth, social network effects, distributed computing, workforce management, and portfolio management. They have also been used to analyze traffic congestion.

Recently, agent based modelling and simulation has been applied to various domains such as studying the impact of publication venues by researchers in the computer science domain (journals versus conferences). In addition, ABMs have been used to simulate information delivery in ambient assisted environments. A November 2016 article in arXiv analyzed an agent based simulation of posts spread in Facebook. In the domain of peer-to-peer, ad hoc and other self-organizing and complex networks, the usefulness of agent based modeling and simulation has been shown. The use of a computer science-based formal specification framework coupled with wireless sensor networks and an agent-based simulation has recently been demonstrated.

Agent based evolutionary search or algorithm is a new research topic for solving complex optimization problems.
===In team science===
In the realm of team science, agent-based modeling has been utilized to assess the effects of team members&#x27; characteristics and biases on team performance across various settings. By simulating interactions between agents—each representing individual team members with distinct traits and biases—this modeling approach enables researchers to explore how these factors collectively influence the dynamics and outcomes of team performance. Consequently, agent-based modeling provides a nuanced understanding of team science, facilitating a deeper exploration of the subtleties and variabilities inherent in team-based collaborations.

===In economics and social sciences===
Prior to, and in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, interest has grown in ABMs as possible tools for economic analysis. ABMs do not assume the economy can achieve equilibrium and &quot;representative agents&quot; are replaced by agents with diverse, dynamic, and interdependent behavior including herding. ABMs take a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach and can generate extremely complex and volatile simulated economies. ABMs can represent unstable systems with crashes and booms that develop out of non-linear (disproportionate) responses to proportionally small changes. A July 2010 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; looked at ABMs as alternatives to DSGE models. The journal &quot;Nature&quot; also encouraged agent-based modeling with an editorial that suggested ABMs can do a better job of representing financial markets and other economic complexities than standard models along with an essay by J. Doyne Farmer and Duncan Foley that argued ABMs could fulfill both the desires of Keynes to represent a complex economy and of Robert Lucas to construct models based on microfoundations. Farmer and Foley pointed to progress that has been made using ABMs to model parts of an economy, but argued for the creation of a very large model that incorporates low level models. By modeling a complex system of analysts based on three distinct behavioral profiles – imitating, anti-imitating, and indifferent – financial markets were simulated to high accuracy. Results showed a correlation between network morphology and the stock market index. However, the ABM approach has been criticized for its lack of robustness between models, where similar models can yield very different results.

ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment and the examination of public policy applications to land-use. There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM&#x27;s ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network. Heterogeneity and dynamics can be easily built in ABM models to address wealth inequality and social mobility.

ABMs have also been proposed as applied educational tools for diplomats in the field of international relations and for domestic and international policymakers to enhance their evaluation of public policy.

=== In water management ===
ABMs have also been applied in water resources planning and management, particularly for exploring, simulating, and predicting the performance of infrastructure design and policy decisions, and in assessing the value of cooperation and information exchange in large water resources systems.

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely &quot;Systems for Agents&quot; and &quot;Agents for Systems.&quot; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

===Self-driving cars===
Hallerbach et al. discussed the application of agent-based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle-under-test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents. Waymo has created a multi-agent simulation environment Carcraft to test algorithms for self-driving cars. It simulates traffic interactions between human drivers, pedestrians and automated vehicles. People&#x27;s behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior. The basic idea of using agent-based modeling to understand self-driving cars was discussed as early as 2003.

==Implementation==

Many ABM frameworks are designed for serial von-Neumann computer architectures, limiting the speed and scalability of implemented models. Since emergent behavior in large-scale ABMs is dependent of population size, scalability restrictions may hinder model validation. Such limitations have mainly been addressed using distributed computing, with frameworks such as Repast HPC specifically dedicated to these type of implementations. While such approaches map well to cluster and supercomputer architectures, issues related to communication and synchronization, as well as deployment complexity, remain potential obstacles for their widespread adoption.

A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units GPUs for ABM simulation. The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

===Integration with other modeling forms===

Since Agent-Based Modeling is more of a modeling framework than a particular piece of software or platform, it has often been used in conjunction with other modeling forms. For instance, agent-based models have also been combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This provides a useful combination where the ABM serves as a process model and the GIS system can provide a model of pattern. Similarly, Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools and agent-based models are sometimes integrated, where the ABM is used to simulate the dynamics on the network while the SNA tool models and analyzes the network of interactions. Tools like GAMA provide a natural way to integrate system dynamics and GIS with ABM. 

==Verification and validation==
Verification and validation (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important. Verification involves making sure the implemented model matches the conceptual model, whereas validation ensures that the implemented model has some relationship to the real-world. Face validation, sensitivity analysis, calibration, and statistical validation are different aspects of validation. A discrete-event simulation framework approach for the validation of agent-based systems has been proposed. A comprehensive resource on empirical validation of agent-based models can be found here.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system), a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model. Another software engineering method, i.e. Test-Driven Development has been adapted to for agent-based model validation. This approach has another advantage that allows an automatic validation using unit test tools.

<text>MV &quot;Alexia&quot; was one of nine Royal Dutch/Shell oil tankers converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship). The group is collectively known as the &quot;Rapana&quot; class.

MV &quot;Alexia&quot; was built at Bremer Vulkan and completed in April, 1935 as an oil tanker for the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell line. She sustained severe damage in two separate U-boat attacks in 1940 and 1942.

After the second attack was converted to a MAC ship, entering service in December 1943.

As a MAC ship, she had no aircraft hangar, and continued to carry normal cargoes, although operating under Royal Navy control. Only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel.

At the end of the war, &quot;Alexia&quot; was reconverted to an oil tanker, and renamed &quot;Ianthina&quot; in 1951. She served in this capacity until broken up for scrap at Blyth in 1954.

<text>Central Railway was a British company which proposed to build a new intermodal freight railway line, with a generous loading gauge, connecting the Channel Tunnel with the north of England, particularly Liverpool docks, using much of the trackbed of the former north–south Great Central Railway. The company argued that such a line could significantly cut road congestion by carrying lorries on flatbed rail trucks.

The company was formed in the late 1980s, and its proposals were controversial and faced opposition. The plans were rejected by the government in 1996 and again in 2003, largely because of doubts over financing its £8 billion cost, even though it was a private-sector project.

==Route==
The line would have run from the Liverpool Docks to Sheffield using the disused Woodhead Tunnel and then turned south via the Erewash Valley, joining the former Great Central Main Line (much of whose trackbed was still intact) south of Leicester. At a rebuilt Ashendon Junction it would have joined the Chiltern Main Line, running alongside it on new tracks, then paralleling the M25 motorway, entering a new tunnel between Leatherhead and Merstham and then running alongside existing railways via to the Channel Tunnel terminal at Folkestone. An alternative route would have seen the line joining High Speed 1 to the tunnel, if the latter railway were to allow non-passenger trains.

==Purpose==
The line would carry goods lorries between the continent and the Midlands and north of England. It could also have helped facilitate railfreight connections between the north of England and the ports of Felixstowe and Southampton. Trains long would carry up to 80 lorry trailers each, in the manner of American piggyback services. It would be operated by diesel locomotives, at least in the first instance, in order to save on electrification costs.

The promoters stated that lorries already made a modal interchange to go through the Channel Tunnel. The Central Railway scheme would simply make the interchange between points or more apart, rather than at present, saving haulage companies fuel and drastically reducing carbon emissions.

==Financial backing==
In early 2006, the company said that 11 banks were backing the project.

==Personnel==
The chairman of Central Railway was Andrew Gritten and chief executive of Central Railway was Alan Stevens, who was a UKIP county councillor in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, between 2013 and 2017.

McGregor&#x27;s work was rooted in motivation theory alongside the works of Abraham Maslow, who created the hierarchy of needs. The two theories proposed by McGregor describe contrasting models of workforce motivation applied by managers in human resource management, organizational behavior, organizational communication and organizational development. Theory X explains the importance of heightened supervision, external rewards, and penalties, while Theory Y highlights the motivating role of job satisfaction and encourages workers to approach tasks without direct supervision. Management use of Theory X and Theory Y can affect employee motivation and productivity in different ways, and managers may choose to implement strategies from both theories into their practices.

== McGregor and Maslow ==
McGregor&#x27;s Theory X and Theory Y and Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs are both rooted in motivation theory. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs consists of physiological needs (lowest level), safety needs, love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization (highest level). According to Maslow, a human is motivated by the level they have not yet reached, and self-actualization cannot be met until each of the lower levels has been fulfilled. Assumptions of Theory Y, in relation to Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy put an emphasis on employee higher level needs, such as esteem needs and self-actualization.

McGregor also believed that self-actualization was the highest level of reward for employees. He theorized that the motivation employees use to reach self-actualization allows them to reach their full potential. This led companies to focus on how their employees were motivated, managed, and led, creating a Theory Y management style which focuses on the drive for individual self-fulfillment. McGregor&#x27;s perspective places the responsibility for performance on managers as well as subordinates.

== Theory X ==

Theory X is based on negative assumptions regarding the typical worker. This management style assumes that the typical worker has little ambition, avoids responsibility, and is individual-goal oriented. In general, Theory X style managers believe their employees are less intelligent, lazier, and work solely for a sustainable income. Management believes employees&#x27; work is based on their own self-interest. Managers who believe employees operate in this manner are more likely to use rewards or punishments as motivation. Due to these assumptions, Theory X concludes the typical workforce operates more efficiently under a hands-on approach to management. Theory X managers believe all actions should be traceable to the individual responsible. This allows the individual to receive either a direct reward or a reprimand, depending on the outcome&#x27;s positive or negative nature. This managerial style is more effective when used in a workforce that is not essentially motivated to perform.

According to McGregor, there are two opposing approaches to implementing Theory X: the hard approach and the soft approach. The hard approach depends on close supervision, intimidation, and immediate punishment. This approach can potentially yield a hostile, minimally cooperative workforce and resentment towards management. Managers are always looking for mistakes from employees, because they do not trust their work. Theory X is a &quot;we versus they&quot; approach, meaning it is the management versus the employees.

The soft approach is characterized by leniency and less strict rules in hopes for creating high workplace morale and cooperative employees. Implementing a system that is too soft could result in an entitled, low-output workforce. McGregor believes both ends of the spectrum are too extreme for efficient real-world application. Instead, McGregor feels that an approach located in the middle would be the most effective implementation of Theory X.

Because managers and supervisors are in almost complete control of the work, this produces a more systematic and uniform product or work flow. Theory X can benefit a work place that utilizes an assembly line or manual labor. Using this theory in these types of work conditions allows employees to specialize in particular work areas which in turn allows the company to mass-produce a higher quantity and quality of work.

== Theory Y ==
Theory Y is based on positive assumptions regarding the typical worker. Theory Y managers assume employees are internally motivated, enjoy their job, and work to better themselves without a direct reward in return. These managers view their employees as one of the most valuable assets to the company, driving the internal workings of the corporation. Employees additionally tend to take full responsibility for their work and do not need close supervision to create a quality product. It is important to note, however, that before an employee carries out their task, they must first obtain the manager&#x27;s approval. This ensures work stays efficient, productive, and in-line with company standards.

Theory Y managers gravitate towards relating to the worker on a more personal level, as opposed to a more conductive and teaching-based relationship. As a result, Theory Y followers may have a better relationship with their boss, creating a healthier atmosphere in the workplace. In comparison to Theory X, Theory Y incorporates a pseudo-democratic environment to the workforce. This allows the employee to design, construct, and publish their work in a timely manner in co-ordinance to their workload and projects.

Although Theory Y encompasses creativity and discussion, it does have limitations. While there is a more personal and individualistic feel, this leaves room for error in terms of consistency and uniformity. The workplace lacks unvarying rules and practices, which could potentially be detrimental to the quality standards of the product and strict guidelines of a given company.

== Theory Z ==

Humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, upon whose work McGregor drew for Theories X and Y,
went on to propose his own model of workplace motivation, Theory Z. Unlike Theories X and Y, Theory Z recognizes a transcendent dimension to work and worker motivation. An optimal managerial style would help cultivate worker creativity, insight, meaning and moral excellence.

== Choosing a management style ==
For McGregor, Theory X and Theory Y are not opposite ends of the same continuum, but rather two different continua in themselves. In order to achieve the most efficient production, a combination of both theories may be appropriate. This approach is derived from Fred Fiedler&#x27;s research over various leadership styles known as the contingency theory. This theory states that managers evaluate the workplace and choose their leadership style based upon both internal and external conditions presented. Managers who choose the Theory X approach have an authoritarian style of management. An organization with this style of management is made up of several levels of supervisors and managers who actively intervene and micromanage the employees. On the contrary, managers who choose the Theory Y approach have a hands-off style of management. An organization with this style of management encourages participation and values individuals&#x27; thoughts and goals. However, because there is no optimal way for a manager to choose between adopting either Theory X or Theory Y, it is likely that a manager will need to adopt both approaches depending on the evolving circumstances and levels of internal and external locus of control throughout the workplace.

== Military command and control ==
Theory X and Theory Y also have implications in military command and control (C2). Older, strictly hierarchical conceptions of C2, with narrow centralization of decision rights, highly constrained patterns of interaction, and limited information distribution tend to arise from cultural and organizational assumptions compatible with Theory X. On the other hand, more modern, network-centric, and decentralized concepts of C2, that rely on individual initiative and self-synchronization, tend to arise more from a &quot;Theory Y&quot; philosophy. Mission Command, for example, is a command philosophy to which many modern military establishments aspire, and which involves individual judgment and action within the overall framework of the commander&#x27;s intent. Its assumptions about the value of individual initiative make it more a Theory-Y than a Theory X philosophy.

<text>An artificial society is an agent-based computational model for computer simulation in social analysis. It is mostly connected to the themes of complex systems, emergence, the Monte Carlo method, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming. While the concept was simple, actually realizing this conceptual point took a while. Complex mathematical models have been, and are, common; deceivingly simple models only have their roots in the late forties, and took the advent of the microcomputer to really get up to speed.

== Overview ==

The aim is to construct parallel simulations consisting of computational devices, referred to as agents, with given properties, in order to model the target phenomena. The subject is the process of emergence from the lower (micro) level of a social system to the higher (or macro) level. 

The history of agent-based modeling can be traced back to Von Neumann machines, the concept of a machine capable of reproduction. The device he proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then extended by von Neumann&#x27;s friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician, who suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up, thus creating the first of the devices later termed cellular automata. 

A further advance was achieved by mathematician John Conway. He constructed the well-known game of life. Unlike von Neumann&#x27;s machine, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life operated according to tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard. 

The application of the agent-based model as a social model was primarily initiated by computer scientist Craig Reynolds. He attempted to model living biological agents, a method known as artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton. 

The computational methods of artificial life were applied to the analysis of social systems, christened &quot;the artificial society&quot; by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell. Eventually, the artificial society provided a new method for sociological analysis in the form of computational sociology. The principal problem is that of classical sociology, the issue of macro-micro linkage: as first articulated by French Sociologist Émile Durkheim, the question of how individuals within a social system influence and are influenced by the macrosocial level. 

The artificial society has been widely accepted by recent sociology as a promising method characterized by the extensive use of computer programs and computer simulations which include evolutionary algorithms (EA), genetic algorithms (GA), genetic programming (GP), memetic programming (MP), agent based models, and cellular automata (CA). 

For many, artificial society is a meeting point for people from many other more traditional fields in interdisciplinary research, such as linguistics, social physics, mathematics, philosophy, law, computer science, biology, and sociology in which unusual computational and theoretical approaches that would be controversial within their native discipline can be discussed. As a field, it has had a controversial history; some have characterized it as &quot;practical theology&quot; or a &quot;fact-free science&quot;. However, the recent publication of artificial society articles in the scientific journals e.g.: &quot;Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation&quot; and &quot;Journal of Social Complexity&quot; shows that artificial life techniques are becoming somewhat more accepted within the sociological mainstream.

<text>MV &quot;Gadila&quot; was one of nine Anglo Saxon Royal Dutch/Shell oil tankers converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship). The group is sometimes collectively known as the &quot;Rapana&quot; class.

MV &quot;Gadila&quot; was built at the Howaldtswerke, Kiel, Germany and completed 11 April 1935 as an oil tanker for the Royal Dutch/Shell line. She was converted at Smith&#x27;s Dock, North Shields between April 1943 and 1 February 1944. She entered service as a MAC ship in March 1944, and operated under the Netherlands Mercantile Marine flag.

As a MAC ship, she had no aircraft hangar, and continued to carry normal cargoes with a mercantile ship&#x27;s crew, although operating under British Royal Navy control. Only her air crew and the aviation support staff were Naval personnel. In the case of the &quot;Gadila&quot;, these were provided by the Royal Netherlands Navy and served as elements of Fleet Air Arm 860 (Dutch) Naval Air Squadron.

The &quot;Gadila&quot; and her sister MV &quot;Macoma&quot; were the first aircraft carrying vessels with a flight deck to be operated under the flag of the Netherlands.

At the end of the war, &quot;Gadila&quot; was reconverted to an entirely mercantile oil tanker and served in this capacity until broken up for scrap in Hong Kong in 1958.

<text>Oleg Georgievich Gazenko (; 12 December 1918 – 17 November 2007) was a Russian military officer in the former Soviet Air Force and a program manager in the Soviet space program. 

He headed the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow and was leading a Soviet mission to train animals in space. Gazenko selected and trained Laika, the dog who flew on the 1957 Sputnik 2 mission.

==Early life and Second World War==
Gazenko was born on December 12, 1918, in the village of Mykolaivka, Stavropol Territory to George and Larissa Gazenko, née Nikitin.

In 1941, Gazenko graduated from the Military Department of the 2nd Moscow Medical Institute as a medic 3rd rank (captain in the medical service). He and his whole class were immediately sent to the front. During the war, he served as the chief of an army hospital, 197th Battalion airfield services of the 15th Air Army in the West, South-Western, Bryansk, Baltic and Belorussian fronts, receiving several decorations for his service.

==Research for the Soviet Air Force==
In 1946-1947, Gazenko received special training at the Military Medical Academy (Leningrad) in the department of physiology in the laboratory of Aviation Medicine, where, under the direct supervision of renowned physiologists – Academician Colonel-General Leon Orbeli and Professor Major General M. P. Brestkin – studied the problem and the state of high-altitude physiology of higher nervous activity in hypoxic conditions. During this time he married Olga Alexeevna Tolmachevskaya. Together they had two children – a son, Alexei, and daughter, Larissa.

In 1947, Gazenko was appointed to the Institute of Aviation Medicine of the Ministry of Defence. He was involved in studies of pilots in unfavourable climates—beyond the Arctic Circle and in deserts. Between 1948-1950 as the head of a medical research team, Gazenko took part in high-latitude Arctic air force tests &quot;North Pole-2&quot;, &quot;North Pole-3&quot; and &quot;North Pole-4&quot;. During this time he repeatedly worked on stations situated on drifting ice, as well as on the islands and the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Later he went on to conduct research on airmen working in difficult arid conditions of the Karakum Desert. Between 1951–1952 he served alongside Soviet airmen in the Korean War.

==Space research career==

From 1955 Gazenko worked in the Soviet space program, focusing his efforts on research in the field of space biology and medicine relevant to weightlessness and orbital flight.

Gazenko took a prominent part in a number of biological tests regarding space flight projects. He trained and supervised the animals used in the Sputnik 2 project. Sputnik 2 was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, on November 3, 1957, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika.

Gazenko continued his work as part of the team behind the Vostok program. He supervised and trained the animals used in the 1960 Vostok prototype flight. In the aftermath of its failure, he adopted a survivor of this flight – a small dog named Krasavka (Красавка, &quot;Little Beauty&quot;) also known as Kometka (Кометка, &quot;Little Comet&quot;). Krasavka went on to have puppies and continued living with Gazenko and his family until her death 14 years later. Gazenko was also directly involved in training the first human cosmonauts of the Vostok 1 project, including Yuri Gagarin. Gagarin himself jokingly referred to it by saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m the first man in space, or the last dog in space.&quot;

In 1969, by the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers Gazenko was assigned to the 3rd General Directorate of the Ministry of Health as Director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. His research of that period was focused on basic problems of space biomedicine. The study of the impact of zero gravity on living organisms allowed justification of the principles and methods of protecting humans from the unfavourable effects of space flight and creation of a system of supporting the health and productivity of space crews before, during, and after the flight. From 1978 Gazenko was involved in developing the system of physiological, health, and psychological measures for crews in prolonged space flights and after return to Earth.

He initiated the Cosmos biosatellite nonhuman primate program, which has been highly successful since its genesis in 1979. He recalls how difficult it was to decide to fly a primate for the first time. &quot;It was obvious to us that we had to fly monkeys if we wanted to resolve the big questions about manned space flight. But our expertise was with other animals, like mice and dogs, so we didn&#x27;t dare to fly monkeys for a long time.&quot; Close contacts with American primate researchers were valuable, Gazenko says. &quot;They helped us to overcome the, well, let&#x27;s say the mental barrier.&quot;

==Later life==

Gazenko was elected president of the All-Union (now Russia) Physiological Society named Pavlov in 1987, and retired the following year with the rank of lieutenant-general in the medical services of the Soviet Air Force.

A deputy of the USSR from 1989–1991, – was a member of the Committee on Science and Education of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and was a member of the Commission which investigated the 1989 April 9 tragedy in Tbilisi.

Gazenko was an adviser to the Russian Academy of Sciences at the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation &quot;Institute of Biomedical Problems.&quot;

In 1998 Gazenko expressed regret for the manner of Laika&#x27;s death:

:&quot;Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I&#x27;m sorry about it. We shouldn&#x27;t have done it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.&quot;

Until his death, he acted as an advisor to Anatoly Grigoriev, the current Director of the Institute. He had been appointed to the position of Academician in the Russian Academy of Science. Gazenko died on November 17, 2007; he is buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>Tintin (; ) is the titular protagonist of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comic series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The character was created in 1929 and introduced in , a weekly youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper . Appearing as a young man with a round face and quiff hairstyle, Tintin is depicted as a precocious, multitalented reporter who travels the world with his dog Snowy.

Since his inception in the early 20th century, Tintin has remained a popular literary figure with statues and commemorative murals of the character seen throughout Belgium. In addition to the original comic series, Tintin has appeared in numerous plays, radio shows, television shows, and feature films, including the Steven Spielberg-directed film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011).

As of January 1, 2025, Tintin and other characters appearing in the original 1929 French comic strips entered the public domain in the United States. Subsequent Tintin works will enter the public domain yearly on January 1 if United States copyright laws are not amended. However, Tintin remains under copyright in his original country, Belgium, and other countries utilizing terms that expire after a set period of time following the author&#x27;s death.

==History==

===Influences===
Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted that &quot;Tintin had a prehistory&quot;, being influenced by a variety of sources that Hergé had encountered throughout his life. Hergé noted that during his early schooling in the midst of World War I, when Belgium was under German occupation, he had drawn pictures in the margins of his school workbooks of an unnamed young man battling the (a slang term for Germans). He later commented that these drawings depicted a brave and adventurous character using his intelligence and ingenuity against opponents. None of these early drawings survive.

Hergé was also influenced by the physical appearance and mannerisms of his younger brother Paul, who had a round face and a quiff hairstyle. In search of adventure, Paul later joined the Belgian Army, receiving jeers from fellow officers when the source of Hergé&#x27;s visual inspiration became obvious. Hergé later stated that in his youth, &quot;I watched him a lot; he entertained me and fascinated me... It makes sense that Tintin took on his character, gestures, poses. He had a way of moving and a physical presence that must have inspired me without my knowing it. His gestures stayed in my mind. I copied them clumsily, without meaning to or even knowing I was doing it; it was him I was drawing.&quot;

A few years after young Hergé joined Scouting, he became the unofficial artist for his Scout troop and drew a Boy Scout character for the national magazine . This young man, whom he named Totor, travelled the globe and righted wrongs, all without ruffling his Scout honour. As was the format for European comics at the time, the early drawings of Totor merely illustrated the story; the text that appeared below the drawings is what propelled the action. Years later, Totor would be very much in Hergé&#x27;s mind; his new comics character would be, Hergé himself later said, &quot;the little brother of Totor ... keeping the spirit of a Boy Scout.&quot; Assouline would describe Totor as &quot;a sort of trial run&quot; for Tintin. Novelist and biographer Harry Thompson simply stated that Totor would &quot;metamorphose&quot; into Tintin.

Literary influences have been observed. Benjamin Rabier and Fred Isly published an illustrated story in 1898 titled &quot; (&quot;Tintin the Goblin&quot;&quot;), in which they featured a small goblin boy named Tintin, who had a rounded face and quiff. Hergé agreed that Rabier&#x27;s manner of drawing animals had influenced him, although he swore that he was unaware of the existence of &quot;Tintin-Lutin&quot; until one of his readers later informed him of the similarity. In 1907, Gaston Leroux (author of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;) created the character Joseph Rouletabille, a young journalist and amateur detective. wrote a series of adventures in 1910 titled .

Hergé, an avid news reader, would have been aware of the activities of a number of popular journalists well known in Belgium, notably Joseph Kessel but especially Albert Londres, one of the creators of investigative journalism. Almost certainly another influence was Palle Huld, a 15-year-old Danish Boy Scout who travelled around the world in 1928 and wrote about his adventures the following year. Robert Sexé, a French motorcycle photojournalist, travelled and wrote about the Soviet Union, the Belgian Congo, and the United States—immediately followed by Tintin&#x27;s adventures. Years later, when Hergé was asked who inspired Tintin, he answered, &quot;Tintin c&#x27;est moi.&quot;

Hergé had seen the new style of American comics and was ready to try it. Tintin&#x27;s new comic would be a strip cartoon with dialogue in speech bubbles and drawings that carried the story. Young reporter Tintin would have the investigative acumen of Londres, the travelling abilities of Huld, and the high moral standing of Totor; the Boy Scout travelling reporter that Hergé would have liked to have been.

===Early development===
Tintin appeared after Hergé got his first job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist working at the Catholic newspaper (&quot;&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;), where his director challenged him to create a new serialised comic for its Thursday supplement for young readers, (&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;&quot;). In the edition 30 December 1928 of the satirical weekly newspaper (a parallel publication to &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot;), Hergé included two cartoon gags with word balloons, in which he depicted a boy and a little white dog. Abbe Wallez thought that these characters could be developed further, and asked Hergé to use characters like these for an adventure that could be serialised in . Hergé agreed, and an image of Tintin and Snowy first appeared in the youth supplement on 4 January 1929, in an advert for the upcoming series. Hergé would later insist that Tintin would only be &quot;born&quot; on 10 January 1929, in the first episode of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;.

Hergé admitted that he did not take Tintin seriously in the early &quot;Adventures&quot;, explaining simply that he &quot;put the character to the test&quot;; that he created Tintin &quot;as a joke between friends, forgotten the next day.&quot; Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters noted that Tintin was &quot;supremely Belgian&quot; in his characteristics, a view echoed by Assouline, who deemed all of the protagonists of the early &quot;Adventures&quot; &quot;very Belgian&quot;. Hergé himself commented: &quot;my early works are books by a young Belgian filled with the prejudices and ideas of a Catholic, they are books that could have been written by any Belgian in my situation. They are not very intelligent, I know, and do me no honour: they are &#x27;Belgian&#x27; books.&quot; Peeters ultimately considers the early Tintin to be &quot;incoherent ... a Sartre-esque character&quot;, an &quot;existentialist before the term had been coined&quot;, going on to observe that Tintin exists only through his actions, is just a narrative vehicle, having &quot;no surname, no family, hardly anything of a face, and the mere semblance of a career.&quot;

== Characterisation ==
=== Description ===
The image of Tintin—a round-faced young man running with a white fox terrier by his side—is easily one of the most recognisable visual icons of the twentieth century. Hergé created Tintin as a young, blonde Belgian who is a native of Brussels, visualizing Hergé&#x27;s values of conservative values and traditional norms. Assouline deemed Tintin to be middle-class, which he considers one of the few traits that the character had in common with Hergé. In his first appearance, Tintin is dressed in a long travelling coat and hat, a few pages later adopting his plus fours, check suit, black socks, and Eton collar. At first, the famous quiff is plastered to Tintin&#x27;s forehead, but during a particularly vigorous car chase in what became page 8 of the printed volume, his quiff is out and remains so. By the time he arrives in Chicago for his third adventure, both Hergé and his readers feel they know Tintin well, and he was to change little in either appearance or dress. Hergé was once asked by interviewer Numa Sadoul how the character Tintin developed; he replied, &quot;He practically did not evolve. Graphically, he remained an outline. Look at his features: his face is a sketch, a formula.&quot; This view was echoed by Assouline: &quot;Tintin was as uncomplicated as the story line&quot;.

Hergé never explained why he chose Tintin as the character&#x27;s name, stating that it has no inherent meaning. He had previously made use of alliteration with the name of his previous character, Totor. Michael Farr believes that &quot;Tintin&quot; is probably the character&#x27;s surname because other characters, such as his landlady, occasionally refer to him as Mr. Tintin (as printed on his doorbell). Assouline asserted that it cannot be his surname because he lacks a family, believing that Hergé had adopted it because &quot;it sounded heroic, clear, and cheerful&quot; as well as being easy to remember.

Tintin&#x27;s age is never specified. Throughout the &quot;Adventures&quot;, published over 50 years, he remained youthful. &quot;Tintin was born at fifteen&quot;, says Assouline. Hergé commented, &quot;For me, Tintin hasn&#x27;t aged. What age do I give him? I don&#x27;t know ... 17? In my judgement, he was 14 or 15 when I created him, Boy Scout, and he has practically not moved on. Suppose he put on 3 or 4 years in 40 years ... Good, work out an average, 15 and 4 equals 19.&quot;

=== Occupation ===
From Tintin&#x27;s first adventure, he lives the life of a campaigning reporter. He is sent to the Soviet Union, where he writes his editor a dispatch. He travels to the Belgian Congo, where he engages in photojournalism. When he travels to China in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, the &quot;Shanghai News&quot; features the front-page headline, &quot;Tintin&#x27;s Own Story&quot;. In &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, with notebook in hand, Tintin questions the director of the Museum of Ethnography over a recent theft. Sometimes Tintin is the one being interviewed, such as when a radio reporter presses him for details, &quot;In your own words.&quot; But aside from these few examples, Tintin is never actually seen consulting with his editor or delivering a story.

As his adventures continue. Tintin is less often seen reporting and is more often seen as a detective, pursuing his investigative journalism from his apartment at No. 26 Labrador Street. Other characters refer to him as Sherlock Holmes, as he has a sharp intellect, an eye for detail, and powers of deduction. Like Holmes, he is occasionally a master of disguise, and in Rastapopoulos even has an archenemy.

Tintin&#x27;s occupation drifts further in later adventures, abandoning all pretence of reporting news and instead making news in his role of explorer. Clearly unencumbered with financial preoccupations, after &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; he is ensconced as a permanent house guest in the stately Marlinspike Hall with retired mariner Captain Haddock and the scientist Professor Calculus. Tintin occupies all of his time with his friends, exploring the bottom of the sea, the tops of the mountains, and the surface of the Moon (sixteen years before astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin). Through it all, Tintin finds himself cast in the role of international social crusader, sticking up for the underdog and looking after those less fortunate than himself.

=== Skills and abilities ===
From the first volume onward, Hergé depicted Tintin as being adept at driving or fixing any mechanical vehicle that he comes across. Given the opportunity, Tintin is at ease driving any automobile, has driven a moon tank, and is comfortable with every aspect of aviation. He is also a skilled radio operator with knowledge of Morse code. He packs a solid punch to a villain&#x27;s jaw when necessary, demonstrates impressive swimming skills, and is a crack shot. He proves himself a capable engineer and scientist during his adventure to the Moon. He is also an excellent athlete, in outstanding condition, able to walk, run, and swim long distances. Hergé summarized Tintin&#x27;s abilities thusly: &quot;a hero without fear and beyond reproach.&quot; More than anything else, Tintin is a quick thinker and an effective diplomat. He is simply an all-rounder, good at almost everything, which is what Hergé himself would have liked to be.

=== Personality ===
Tintin&#x27;s personality evolved as Hergé wrote the series. Peeters relates that in the early &quot;Adventures&quot;, Tintin&#x27;s personality was &quot;incoherent&quot;, in that he was &quot;[s]ometimes foolish and sometimes omniscient, pious to the point of mockery and then unacceptably aggressive&quot;, ultimately just serving as a &quot;narrative vehicle&quot; for Hergé&#x27;s plots. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline notes that in the early &quot;Adventures&quot;, Tintin shows &quot;little sympathy for humanity&quot;. Assouline describes the character as &quot;obviously celibate, excessively virtuous, chivalrous, brave, a defender of the weak and oppressed, never looks for trouble but always finds it.&quot;

Michael Farr deems Tintin to be an intrepid young man of high moral standing, with whom his audience can identify. His rather neutral personality permits a balanced reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness that surrounds him, allowing the reader to assume Tintin&#x27;s position within the story rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin&#x27;s representation enhances this aspect, with comics expert Scott McCloud noting that the combination of Tintin&#x27;s iconic, neutral personality and Hergé&#x27;s &quot;unusually realistic&quot;, signature (&quot;clear line&quot;) style &quot;allows the reader to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world.&quot;

To the other characters, Tintin is honest, decent, compassionate, and kind. He is also modest and self-effacing, which Hergé also was, and is the most loyal of friends, which Hergé strove to be. The reporter does have vices, becoming too tipsy before facing the firing squad (in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;) or too angry when informing Captain Haddock that he nearly cost them their lives (in &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;). However, as Michael Farr observes, Tintin has &quot;tremendous spirit&quot; and, in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, is appropriately given the name Great Heart. By turns, Tintin is innocent, politically crusading, escapist, and finally cynical. If he has perhaps too much of the goody-goody about him, at least he is not priggish; Hergé admitting as much, saying, &quot;If Tintin is a moralist, he&#x27;s a moralist who doesn&#x27;t take things too seriously, so humour is never far away from his stories.&quot; It is this sense of humour that makes the appeal of Tintin truly international.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. Tintin remains popular today; by the time of the centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth in 2007, &quot;Tintin&quot; had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.

=== Literary criticism ===

The study of Tintin has become the life work of many literary critics, observers sometimes referring to this study as &quot;Tintinology&quot;. A prominent literary critic of Tintin is Philippe Goddin, &quot;Belgium&#x27;s leading authority on Hergé&quot;, author of numerous books on the subject, including &quot;Hergé and Tintin, Reporters&quot; and the biography . In 1983, Benoît Peeters published , subsequently published in English as &quot;Tintin and the World of Hergé&quot; in 1988. The reporter Michael Farr brought &quot;Tintin&quot; literary criticism to the English language with works such as &quot;Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure&quot; (1989), &quot;Tintin: The Complete Companion&quot; (2001), &quot;Tintin &amp; Co.&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Adventures of Hergé&quot; (2007), as had English screenwriter Harry Thompson, the author of &quot;Tintin: Hergé and his Creation&quot; (1991).

=== Controversy ===
Tintin&#x27;s earliest stories naively depicted controversial images, with Tintin engaging in racial stereotypes, animal cruelty, violence, colonialism, including ethnocentric caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans, most notably and notoriously in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;. Later, Hergé made corrections to Tintin&#x27;s actions, for example, replacing Tintin&#x27;s dynamiting of a rhinoceros with an incident in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin&#x27;s rifle, and called his earlier actions &quot;a transgression of my youth.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
As Farr observes, &quot;Hergé created a hero who embodied human qualities and virtues but no faults. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; mirror the past century while Tintin himself provides a beacon of excellence for the future.&quot; Thompson says Tintin is &quot;almost featureless, ageless, sexless&quot;, and does not appear to be burdened with a personality. Yet this very anonymity remains the key to Tintin&#x27;s gigantic international success. With so little to mark him out, anybody can identify with him and live out his adventures. Millions have done so, both adults and children, including the likes of Steven Spielberg, Andy Warhol, Wim Wenders, Françoise Sagan, Harold Macmillan and General Charles de Gaulle, who considered Tintin his only international rival.

While working on Tintin&#x27;s next adventure, &quot;Tintin and the Alph&#x27;Art&quot;, Hergé died at 76 on 3 March 1983, and with him died the adventures of his most famous character. Several leading French and Belgian newspapers devoted their front pages to the news, some illustrating it with a panel of Snowy grieving over his master&#x27;s unconscious body.

==== Statues and commemorative murals of Tintin ====
* The Grand Sablon / Grote Zavel, Brussels, Belgium contains a life sized bronze statue of Tintin and his fox terrier, Snowy just outside the Comics Cafe.
* A mural on a building at Rue de l&#x27;Etuve / Stoofstraat on Brussels&#x27; Comic Book Route recreates a scene of Tintin and Captain Haddock coming down a building fire escape from &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;.
* The South station in Brussels contains a huge reproduction of a panel from &quot;Tintin in America&quot;.
* The Le Lombard building in Central Brussels (Near the South railway station) has two giant heads of Tintin and Snowy on the roof. These are lit up with neon lights at night. Lombard was the editor of the &quot;Journal de Tintin&quot;.
* The Stokkel/Stockel metro station in Brussels has huge panels with scenes from Tintin comic books painted as murals.
* The Uccle cultural center (Rue Ruge) in Belgium has a life size statue of Tintin and Snowy. The statue was sculpted by Nat Neujean and commissioned by Raymond Leblanc, the publisher of &quot;Tintin magazine&quot;.
* One of the high speed trains of Thalys is covered with images from Tintin comic books.
* The Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels contains a 1952 bust of Tintin by the artist Nat Neujean
* In 2024, Adidas would design a new away jersey for the Belgium national football team inspired by Tintin&#x27;s outfit.

== Adaptations ==
Tintin has appeared in real-life events staged by publishers for publicity stunts. Tintin&#x27;s first live appearance was at the Gare du Nord station in Brussels on 8 May 1930, towards the end publication of the first adventure, &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;. Fifteen-year-old Lucien Pepermans dressed to play the part and travelled with Hergé to the station by train. They were expecting only a handful of readers but instead found themselves mobbed by a whole horde of fans.
Fourteen-year-old Henri Dendoncker appeared as Tintin returning from &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;.
Others have played Tintin returning from the adventures &quot;Tintin in America&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;.

Actress Jane Rubens was the first to play Tintin on stage in April 1941. The plays, written by Jacques Van Melkebeke, included &quot;Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond&quot; and &quot;Mr. Boullock&#x27;s Disappearance&quot;. She was later replaced by 11-year-old Roland Ravez, who also lent his voice to recordings of the &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. Jean-Pierre Talbot played Tintin in two live-action movie adaptations: &quot;Tintin and the Golden Fleece&quot; (1961) and &quot;Tintin and the Blue Oranges&quot; (1964). Canadian actor Colin O&#x27;Meara voiced Tintin in the 1991 Canadian-made &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; animated TV series, which originally aired on HBO and subsequently on Nickelodeon. At the same time, actor Richard Pearce provided the voice of Tintin for a radio drama series of Tintin created by the BBC, which also starred Andrew Sachs as Snowy. In 2005, English actor Russell Tovey played the role at the London Barbican Theatre for a Young Vic adaptation of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;.

Shortly before Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983, he came to admire the work of Steven Spielberg; who he felt was the only director who could successfully bring his Tintin to the big screen. The result was the 2011 motion capture feature film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, which merges plots from three &quot;Tintin&quot; books.

<text>MV &quot;Macoma&quot; was one of nine Anglo Saxon Royal Dutch/Shell oil tankers converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship). The group is sometimes collectively known as the Rapana Class.

Macoma was launched on 31 December 1935 at Nederlandse Scheepsbouw Mij, Amsterdam as an oil tanker and entered service the following year. She was converted to a MAC ship from late 1943 to April 1944, and commissioned 1 April 1944.

As a MAC ship, she had no aircraft hangar, and continued to carry normal cargoes, although operating under Royal Navy control. Only her air crew and aviation support staff were naval personnel. In the case of the &quot;Macoma&quot;, these were provided by the Royal Netherlands Navy including the Dutch Fleet Air Arm 860 and 861 squadrons.

The Macoma and her sister were the first aircraft carrying vessels with a flight deck to be operated under the flag of the Netherlands.

After the war, MV &quot;Macoma&quot; was reconverted and returned to merchant service as an oil tanker and served in that role until scrapped in Hong Kong in 1959.

The British Ship Adoption Society, a Maritime Charity, was formed in the early part of the Second World War, with a large number of schools taking part in the scheme, amassing comforts for a particular ship and in return the children would receive letters of thanks and news from various ports around the world to which it would sail. the M.V Miralda was adopted by Styal Cottage Homes, a home colony and school for orphaned and destitute children of Manchester.

After the war, &quot;Miralda&quot; was reconverted and returned to merchant service as an oil tanker and served in that role until scrapped in Hong Kong in 1960. She was renamed &quot;Marisa&quot; in 1950.

<text>Constantine (, , fl. 520–523) was a 6th-century king of Dumnonia in sub-Roman Britain, who was remembered in later British tradition as a legendary King of Britain. The only contemporary information about him comes from Gildas, who castigated him for various sins, including the murder of two &quot;royal youths&quot; inside a church. The historical Constantine is also known from the genealogies of the Dumnonian kings, and possibly inspired the tradition of Saint Constantine, a king-turned-monk venerated in southwest Britain and elsewhere.

In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth included Constantine in his pseudohistorical chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, adding details to Gildas&#x27; account and making Constantine the successor to King Arthur as King of Britain. Under Geoffrey&#x27;s influence, Constantine appeared as Arthur&#x27;s heir in later chronicles. Less commonly, he also appeared in that role in medieval Arthurian romances and prose works, and in some modern versions of the legend.

==History==

The 6th-century monk Gildas mentions Constantine in chapters 28 and 29 of work &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. Constantine is one of five Brittonic kings whom the author rebukes and compares to Biblical beasts. Gildas calls Constantine the &quot;tyrannical whelp of the unclean lioness of Damnonia&quot;, a reference to the books of Daniel and Revelation, and apparently also a slur directed at his mother. This &quot;Damnonia&quot; is generally identified as the kingdom of Dumnonia in present-day South West England. Scholars such as Lloyd Laing and Leslie Alcock note the possibility that Gildas may have instead intended the territory of the Damnonii, a tribe in present-day Scotland mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, but others such as Thomas D. O&#x27;Sullivan consider this unlikely.

Gildas says that despite swearing an oath against deceit and tyranny, Constantine disguised himself in an abbot&#x27;s robes and attacked two &quot;royal youths&quot; praying before a church altar, killing them and their companions. Gildas is clear that Constantine&#x27;s sins were manifold even before this, as he had committed &quot;many adulteries&quot; after casting off his lawfully wedded wife. Gildas encourages Constantine, whom he knows to still be alive at the time, to repent his sins lest he be damned. The murders may relate to a 6th-century cult in Brittany honoring the &quot;Saints Dredenau&quot;, two young princes killed by an ambitious uncle.

Scholars generally identify Gildas&#x27; Constantine with the figure &quot;Custennin Gorneu&quot; or &quot;Custennin Corneu&quot; (Constantine of Cornwall) who appears in the genealogies of the kings of Dumnonia. Custennin is mentioned as the father of Erbin and the grandfather of the hero Geraint in the &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;, the prose romance &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, and after emendation, the genealogies in Jesus College MS 20. Based on Custennin&#x27;s placement in the genealogies, Thomas D. O&#x27;Sullivan suggests a &quot;floruit&quot; for Constantine of 520–523.

==Saint Constantine==
The historical Constantine of Dumnonia may have influenced later traditions, known in southwestern Britain as well as in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, about a Saint Constantine who is usually said to have been a king who gave up his crown to become a monk. The Cornish and Welsh traditions especially may have been influenced by Gildas, in particular his adjuration for Constantine to repent; the belief may have been that the reproach eventually worked.

The two major centers for the &quot;cultus&quot; of Saint Constantine were the church in Constantine Parish and the Chapel of Saint Constantine in St Merryn Parish (now Constantine Bay), both in Cornwall. The former was established by at least the 11th century, as it is mentioned in Rhygyfarch&#x27;s 11th-century &quot;Life of Saint David&quot;. At this time it may have supported a clerical community, but in later centuries it was simply a parish church. The Chapel at Constantine Bay had a holy well, and was the center of its own sub-parish.

The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (&quot;Welsh Annals&quot;) and the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record the conversion of a certain Constantine; these may be a reference to the Cornish saint and therefore to the historical figure. Several subsequent religious texts refer to Constantine, generally associating him with Cornwall, often specifically as its king. The &quot;Life of Saint David&quot; says that Constantine, King of Cornwall, gave up his crown and joined Saint David&#x27;s monastery at Menevia. The &quot;Vitae Petroci&quot; includes an episode in which Saint Petroc protects a stag being hunted by a wealthy man named Constantine, who eventually converts and becomes a monk. Here Constantine is not said to be king, but a 12th-century text referring to this story, the &quot;Miracula&quot;, specifically names him as such, further adding that upon his conversion he gave Petroc an ivory horn that became one of the saint&#x27;s chief relics. A number of other traditions attested across Britain describe saints or kings named Constantine, suggesting a confusion and conflation of various figures.

Other sites in Southwestern Britain associated with figures named Constantine include the church of Milton Abbot, Devon; a chapel in nearby Dunterton, Devon; and a chapel in Illogan, Cornwall. The two Devon sites may have been dedicated instead to Constantine the Great, as local churches were subject to Tavistock Abbey, dedicated to Constantine the Great&#x27;s mother Helena. In Wales, two churches were dedicated to Constantine: Llangystennin (in Conwy) and Welsh Bicknor (now in Herefordshire, England). The church in Govan, a parish in present-day Scotland, was also dedicated to a Saint Constantine.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth and the chronicle tradition==

===Historia Regum Britanniae===

Geoffrey of Monmouth includes Constantine in a section of his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; adapted from Gildas. As he does throughout the work, Geoffrey alters his source material, recasting Gildas&#x27; reproved kings as successors, rather than contemporaries as in &quot;De Excidio&quot;. In addition to Gildas, Geoffrey evidently knew the Dumnonian genealogy essentially as it appears in &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot; and similar sources. He further adds a number of other details not found in earlier sources, identifying Constantine as a son of Cador, a Cornish ruler known in Welsh tradition as Cadwy mab Geraint. Notably, Geoffrey&#x27;s Constantine is King Arthur&#x27;s kinsman and succeeds him as King of the Britons. Norris J. Lacy and Geoffrey Ashe suggest Geoffrey made this Arthurian connection based on an existing tradition locating Arthur&#x27;s birthplace in southwest Britain. However, noting that the earliest references place Arthur in northern Britain rather than the southwest, Rachel Bromwich considers the connection an arbitrary invention by Geoffrey, perhaps suggested by his earlier inventions of familial ties between Arthur and Constantine the Great and the usurper Constantine III. Geoffrey calls Constantine Arthur&#x27;s &quot;cognatus&quot;, or blood relative, but does not specify the exact relation, causing much confusion for later writers.

In Geoffrey, Arthur passes his crown to his relative Constantine after being mortally wounded by the traitor Mordred in the Battle of Camlann. Geoffrey identifies Gildas&#x27; &quot;royal youths&quot; as Mordred&#x27;s two sons, who, along with their Saxon allies, continue their father&#x27;s insurrection after his death. After &quot;many battles&quot; Constantine routs the rebels, and Mordred&#x27;s sons flee to London and Winchester, where they hide in a church and a friary, respectively. Constantine hunts them down and executes them before the altars of their sanctuaries. Divine retribution for this transgression comes three years later when Constantine is killed by his nephew Aurelius Conanus (Gildas&#x27; Aurelius Caninus), precipitating a civil war. He is buried at Stonehenge alongside other kings of Britain.

Latin scholar Neil Wright considers Geoffrey&#x27;s changes to Gildas to be deliberate reformulations that produce a more sympathetic picture of Constantine and his successors. For Wright, identifying the &quot;royal youths&quot; as traitors justifies the killing, reducing Constantine&#x27;s offence from murder to sacrilege (for killing the traitors in sanctuary). Overall, scholars regard Geoffrey&#x27;s depiction of Constantine as pessimistic, highlighting how little of Arthur&#x27;s legacy survives his death.

===Later chronicles===
Geoffrey returned to Constantine&#x27;s struggles and untimely murder in his later work &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;. The text, set during the reign of Aurelius Conanus, recounts how Constantine gave Mordred&#x27;s sons a &quot;cruel death&quot; and ended their destructive rebellion, omitting details of the killing. According to the &quot;Vita&quot;, Constantine ruled only briefly before Conanus rose up, killed him, and seized the kingdom he now governs poorly. Rosemary Morris writes that &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; reinforces the &quot;Historia&quot;&#x27;s message that Constantine was unable to perpetuate the glories of Arthur&#x27;s reign.

Variants of Geoffrey&#x27;s version of Constantine appeared in the numerous later adaptations of the &quot;Historia&quot;, which were widely regarded as authentic in the Middle Ages. Such variants include Wace&#x27;s Anglo-Norman &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, the Welsh &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, and Layamon&#x27;s English &quot;Brut&quot;. These typically reflect Geoffrey&#x27;s cynicism about the character. Layamon, however, adds a touch of optimism, writing that Constantine successfully if briefly answered Arthur&#x27;s charge to rule in his manner. Following Geoffrey, many of these works do not expand upon Constantine&#x27;s relation to Arthur, though others elaborate that he is Arthur&#x27;s nephew. Taking hints from Geoffrey&#x27;s version of Arthur&#x27;s family tree, these writers make Constantine&#x27;s father Cador a brother, or half-brother, of Arthur through Arthur&#x27;s mother Igraine.

==Later traditions==

===Medieval romance and prose tradition===
Constantine does not figure strongly in the Arthurian romance traditions or prose cycles. He is absent from the French Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles, in which Lancelot and his kin kill off Mordred&#x27;s sons, and no successor to Arthur appears. Some scholars find this omission significant. Rosemary Morris suggests these versions downplay the issue of a designated heir to Arthur to heighten the stakes of Mordred&#x27;s usurpation and to magnify Lancelot&#x27;s role in the story. Richard Trachsler writes that the exclusion of an heir adds a sense of finality to the Arthurian story after Arthur&#x27;s death.

Constantine does appear in some medieval works. In Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse&#x27;s 14th-century &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot;, Lancelot installs Constantine on the throne after Arthur&#x27;s death. He is king of Britain in some versions of the Havelok the Dane legend, beginning with Geoffrey Gaimar&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Estoire des Engleis&quot;. He is also mentioned as Arthur&#x27;s successor in the 14th-century English alliterative poem known as the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, following Arthur&#x27;s war with the Romans and his subsequent mortal battle with Mordred. Other English romances that reference Constantine in passing include the 14th-century &quot;The Awntyrs off Arthure&quot; and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;, written around 1400. Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos&#x27;s 16th-century Portuguese novel &quot;Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Távola Redonda&quot; fuses Constantine with the ubiquitous Round Table knight Sagramore, creating &quot;Sagramor Constantino&quot;, Arthur&#x27;s son-in-law and heir. As king, he forms a new Round Table to defeat the old enemies and continue the glory of Arthurian Britain. Constantine&#x27;s relation to Arthur varies widely in these later works. Many works leave it unstated, while others follow the chronicles in making Constantine Arthur&#x27;s nephew. Several romances, especially English works, cast him as Arthur&#x27;s grand-nephew, with Cador being the son of a (generally unnamed) sister of the king.

Constantine also appears as Arthur&#x27;s heir in Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, including sections adapted from the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;. Malory makes several changes to his source material that expand Constantine&#x27;s role. Malory has Arthur designate Constantine and Baldwin of Britain as regents before going off to fight the Romans, a role that the Alliterative &quot;Morte&quot; ascribes to Mordred. Eugène Vinaver suggests that Malory modelled this change after Henry V&#x27;s appointment of John, Duke of Bedford and Bishop Henry Beaufort as regents. Others finds it likelier that Malory simply wanted to replace Mordred in the Roman war narrative. Malory also expands Constantine&#x27;s role after Arthur&#x27;s death, saying that he ruled honourably and restored the Bishop of Canterbury to his seat. Scholars note that this expansion closes the book on a much more optimistic note than Malory&#x27;s sources, indicating that Arthurian ideals lived on under Constantine.

===Modern literature and media===
Constantine features in some modern treatments of the legend. Katrina Trask&#x27;s &quot;Under King Constantine&quot;, an 1892 book comprising three long romantic poems, is set in his reign. He is an important unseen character in Henry Newbolt&#x27;s 1895 play &quot;Mordred&quot; in his usual role as Arthur&#x27;s successor. He similarly appears in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot;, in which the grievously wounded &quot;Artos&quot; voluntarily passes the crown to him. In Parke Godwin&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Beloved Exile&quot;, Constantine is one of several nobles fighting Guenevere, the protagonist, in a bid to succeed Arthur. He is the chief protagonist of the 1990 computer game &quot;Spirit of Excalibur&quot;; players control Constantine and his allies as they defend the kingdom after Arthur&#x27;s death. Darrell Schweitzer&#x27;s 1995 fantasy story &quot;The Epilogue of the Sword&quot; features an ageing Lancelot returning to serve Constantine against the Saxons. Constantine elaborately figures into Arthur Phillips&#x27; 2011 novel &quot;The Tragedy of Arthur&quot;, which centers on an apocryphal Arthurian play attributed to William Shakespeare that the narrator, a fictional version of Phillips, insists is a hoax created by his father. In the play-within-the-novel, Constantine is Guenhera&#x27;s brother and Arthur&#x27;s vassal and heir; the novel&#x27;s narrator claims that Constantine is based on his father&#x27;s old nemesis, prosecutor Ted Constantine.

<text>In linguistics, functional shift occurs when an existing word takes on a new syntactic function. If no change in form occurs, it is called a zero derivation. For example, the word &quot;like&quot;, formerly only used as a preposition in comparisons (as in &quot;eats like a pig&quot;), is now also used in the same way as the subordinating conjunction &quot;as&quot; in many dialects of English (as in &quot;sounds like he means it&quot;). The boundary between functional shift and conversion (the derivation of a new word from an existing word of identical form) is not well-defined, but it could be construed that conversion changes the lexical meaning and functional shift changes the syntactic meaning.

Shakespeare uses functional shift, for example using a noun to serve as a verb. Researchers found that this technique allows the brain to understand what a word means before it understands the function of the word within a sentence.

<doc id="985648" wikidata="Q6719976" url="?curid=985648" title="MV Rapana">
<text>MV &quot;Rapana&quot; was a Dutch-built oil tanker converted to a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship) during World War II. She was the first tanker to be converted to a MAC ship, and was the lead ship of her class of conversions. &quot;Rapana&quot; was launched as a tanker in April 1935, and served as a merchant vessel until July 1943, when she was converted into a MAC ship. After World War II, the ship was converted back into a tanker and returned to civilian service. In 1950 she was sold and renamed &quot;Rotula&quot;. She was scrapped in Osaka in January 1958.

==Design and description==
MV &quot;Rapana&quot; was built as a “Triple Twelve” oil tanker, with an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . She had a gross registered tonnage of 8000 tons, and 16000 tons under full load. Her Sulzer diesel engine provided 4000 bhp driving a single shaft, giving her a maximum speed of 12.5kts.

After her conversion, &quot;Rapana&quot; had a long and wide flight deck. Due to being converted from a tanker, she did not have a hangar and all aircraft were parked on deck. A safety barrier and windbreak were installed on the flight deck to allow for this. These modifications gave her the capacity to operate 3 Swordfish torpedo bombers in anti-submarine duties. A small island was installed on her starboard side, including the bridge, wheelhouse, and flying control position. Her armament included a single 4 inch (102 mm) QF MK IV, as well as 2 single 40mm Bofors guns and 6 single Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.

Because the ship was still considered a merchant vessel, her crew of 118 was a mix of merchantmen as well as Royal Navy men, with the latter taking care of aircraft maintenance and operations.

==Service history==
MV &quot;Rapana&quot; was initially built at Wilton-Fijenoord, Schiedam, Netherlands, and was launched in March 1935, with work completed a month later in April 1935. She was initially owned and operated by N.V. Petroleum Maats. ‘La Corona’. In 1939, the ship was purchased by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and operated as a merchant ship until 1943, when she was converted into a MAC ship - the first of the MAC tanker ships.

Work to convert &quot;Rapana&quot; to a MAC Ship would be undertaken by Smith&#x27;s Dock Company, and would be completed in July 1943.
After conversion, she would work up for convoy service in the North Atlantic in July 1943. The ship would embark 836L Flight of 836 NAS in August 1943. In October 1943, &quot;Rapana&quot; sailed in convoy SC 143. During the convoy, her Swordfish attacked a U-boat shadowing the convoy, though the effectiveness of the attack was inconclusive. In February 1944, she disembarked 836L. 836 X Flight would embark in April 1944. This flight would disembark at RNAS Maydown in October 1944, and the ship would spend the rest of the conflict without aircraft.

Following the end of the war in 1945, MV &quot;Rapana&quot; was converted back into a tanker. She operated under the Anglo Saxon Petroleum Company until 1950, when the ship was sold back to La Corona and renamed &quot;Rotula&quot;. She operated under this name until January 1958, when the ship was broken up in Osaka by Hanwa Kogyo K.K.

==Notable aircraft==
Swordfish LS326 served aboard her during the war before its transfer to MV &quot;Empire MacCallum&quot;. From 1960 until its disbandment in March 2019, it was part of the Royal Navy Historic Flight. As of 2024, it is airworthy with the Fly Navy Heritage Trust.

<doc id="985650" wikidata="Q2398799" url="?curid=985650" title="Aurelius Conanus">
<text>Aurelius Conanus or Aurelius Caninus was a Brittonic king in 6th-century sub-Roman Britain. The only certain historical record of him is in the writings of his contemporary Gildas, who excoriates him as a tyrant. He is also mentioned in William Winne&#x27;s, The History of Wales (1697) p.7 as one of a succession of kings that fought against the Saxons. However, he may be identified with one of the several similarly named figures active in Britain during this period. In the 12th century Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted Gildas&#x27; account for his chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, and thereafter Aurelius Conanus was remembered as a legendary King of Britain.

==Accounts==
Gildas discusses Aurelius Conanus in Chapter 30 of his work &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, in a section in which he reproves five kings for their various sins. All the kings are compared to Biblical beasts; Aurelius is called the &quot;lion&#x27;s whelp&quot;. Gildas castigates him for his &quot;horrible murders, fornications, and adulteries&quot;, and beseeches him to repent his sins before he ends up like the rest of his family, who have already died pursuing similar ends.

Little else can be said of Aurelius Conanus with any certainty; it is not even known in which part of Britain he ruled. Historian John Edward Lloyd suggests that the form &quot;Caninus&quot;, appearing in one important manuscript of &quot;De Excidio&quot;, may have been a corruption of the more common &quot;Cuna(g)nus&quot;, or Cynan in Welsh. As such he may be identified with one of the figures of that era who bore that name, such as Cynan Garwyn of Powys or his relative Cynin ap Millo. Lloyd suggests a connection with the degenerate descendants of the great hero Ambrosius Aurelianus whom Gildas mentions in Chapter 25. In this case his kingdom may have been located out in the territory later taken by the Anglo-Saxons, i.e. what is now England.

In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted Gildas&#x27; account for his influential pseudohistory &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, adding fictional details and making these contemporary regional rulers successive high-kings of Britain. Geoffrey makes Aurelius Conanus the nephew to the previous king Constantine, whom he kills after a reign of only three years. The kingship should go to another, unnamed uncle of Aurelius&#x27;, but Aurelius pursues a civil war, ultimately imprisoning his kinsman and killing his sons. However, Aurelius only rules for two years before he himself dies; he is succeeded by Vortiporius.

Layamon&#x27;s Brut by Layamon adds the detail that he poisoned his cousins, ill-treated his sisters and died by falling from a horse. The oldest version of the Prose &quot;Brut&quot; names &quot;King Conaan&quot; as the grandfather of Merlin, with Merlin&#x27;s mother being named Adhan.

<text>Goddamnit is the debut album by American punk rock band Alkaline Trio, released October 13, 1998, through Asian Man Records.

==Artwork and title==
The album cover has 3 red alarm clocks, each set at 6:00, representing 666. &quot;I used to set my alarm clock when I was a bike messenger to 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning, and when the alarm clock would go off, the first word out of my mouth was always &#x27;Goddamnit!&#x27;&quot;, says Matt Skiba.

== Reception ==

As of 2008, &quot;Goddamnit&quot; has sold 94,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Mike DaRonco of AllMusic called &quot;Goddamnit&quot; &quot;hands down the perfect listening in the wake of a broken heart&quot; and remarked that &quot;It&#x27;s rare that a band such as Alkaline Trio can make love songs appealing without being labeled as &#x27;wimpy&#x27; or &#x27;generic&#x27;, and &quot;Goddamnit&quot; is the record to erase those labels.&quot;

<text>Vortiporius or Vortipor (, or &quot;Gwerthefyr&quot;) was a king of Dyfed in the early to mid-6th century. He ruled over an area approximately corresponding to modern Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire, Wales. Records from this era are scant, and virtually nothing is known of him or his kingdom. The only contemporary information about Vortiporius comes from the Welsh ecclesiastic Gildas, in a highly allegorical condemnation from his &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; (). At the time the work was written (c. 540), Gildas says that Vortiporius was king of Dyfed, that he was grey with age, that his wife had died, and that he had at least one daughter.

As a legendary king in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th-century treatment of the Matter of Britain, the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Vortiporius was the successor of Aurelius Conanus and was succeeded by Malgo. He is not mentioned in the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; attributed to Nennius. Vortiporius appears in the Irish genealogy given in the 8th-century work &quot;The Expulsion of the Déisi&quot;, in which his name is given as &quot;Gartbuir&quot;. The pedigree given in the Harley MS 5389, written c. 1100, is nearly identical, with his name given as &quot;Guortepir&quot;. In the &quot;Jesus College MS. 20&quot;, he is called &quot;Gwrdeber&quot;. The genealogy in &quot;Expulsion&quot; says he was a descendant of Eochaid Allmuir ( [literally &quot;(from) Overseas&quot;]), who is said to have led a sept of the Déisi in their settlement of Dyfed c. 270.

A memorial stone was discovered in 1895 near the church of Castell Dwyran in Carmarthenshire bearing a Christian cross and with inscriptions in both Latin and in ogham. Dedicated to &quot;Voteporigis&quot; in the Latin inscription and &quot;Votecorigas&quot; in ogham, it was immediately assumed that this referred to Vortiporius. However, this assumption is refuted by modern linguistic analysis, which notes that the missing &#x27;r&#x27; in the first syllable of &#x27;Voteporigis&#x27;/&#x27;Votecorigas&#x27; is significant, and so the stone must be dedicated to a different person. The Latin genitive clearly implies a nominative &quot;Voteporix&quot;.

==Gildas==

In his &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; (), written c. 540, Gildas makes an allegorical condemnation of 5 British kings by likening them to the beasts of the Christian Apocalypse as expressed in the biblical Book of Revelation, 13:2: the lion, leopard, bear, and dragon. In the course of his condemnations, Gildas makes passing reference to the other beasts mentioned in the Apocalypse, such as the eagle, serpent, calf, and wolf. Vortiporius is called &quot;the spotted leopard&quot; and the &quot;tyrant of the Demetians&quot;, where Demetia is the ancient name of Dyfed.

Gildas restricts his attention to the kings of Gwynedd (Maelgwn Gwynedd), Dyfed (Vortiporius), Penllyn (probable, as its king Cuneglasus/Cynlas appears in royal genealogies associated with the region), Damnonia/Alt Clud (Constantine), and the unknown region associated with Caninus. These are all Welsh kingdoms except for Alt Clud, which had a long and ongoing relationship with Gwynedd and its kings, although it is just as likely he could be referencing Dumnonia or modern day Cornwall here which is closer to other kingdoms mentioned.

The reason for Gildas&#x27; disaffection for these individuals is unknown. He was selective in his choice of kings, as he had no comments concerning the kings of the other British kingdoms that were thriving at the time, such as Rheged, Gododdin, Elmet, Pengwern/Powys, or the kingdoms of modern-day southern England. Gildas claims outrage over moral depravity, and begins the condemnation of the five kings with an attack against the mother of one of the kings, calling her an &quot;unclean lioness&quot;.

Of Vortiporius Gildas says little other than offering condemnation for &quot;sins&quot; and providing the few personal details previously mentioned. He is alleged to be the bad son of a good father. Gildas also attacks his daughter, calling her &quot;shameless&quot;, and implies that Vortiporius raped or had a sexual relationship with her.

==Possible monument stone==

A monument bearing both Latin and Irish ogham inscriptions, dated to the 5th or 6th century, is known from Castell Dwyran, Carmarthenshire, Wales. Its Latin inscription reads &quot;Memoria Voteporigis Protictoris&quot; (). The ogham inscription carries only the Goidelic form of his name in the genitive: Votecorigas (early Goidelic did not possess the sound /p/). &quot;Protector&quot; (spelled here &quot;Protictoris&quot;, in the genitive) in the Latin inscription may imply a Roman-era honorific bestowed upon his ancestors, retained as a hereditary title into the 6th century. However, linguist Eric Hamp questions whether this is truly a title, suggesting that &quot;Protector&quot; may rather be a Latin translation of &quot;Uoteporix&quot; (which has essentially the same meaning as the Latin), a &quot;sort of onomastic explanatory gloss&quot;. The ogham inscription in Goidelic shows that Primitive Irish was still in use in this part of Britain at that time, and had not yet died out in South Wales.

The stone&#x27;s original location at the church is next to a meadow known locally as &quot;Parc yr Eglwys&quot;. Local tradition carries the admonition that plowing must not be done near the church. Examination of the meadow showed evidence of large hut-circles.

There remains a substantial question as to whether the stone refers to Vortiporius or to a similarly named individual, &#x27;Voteporigis&#x27;, as the &#x27;r&#x27; in the first syllable would give the name different meaning. Rhys argued that the two individuals were the same person, saying that the &#x27;r&#x27; had been added at a later date, and offering several suppositions as to how this might have happened. However, he was working before the twentieth century advancements in the study of ancient Celtic languages, and his philological conclusions are suspect. More recently, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that the two names cannot refer to the same individual due to differences in their etymologies, adding that dating the stone to the time of Vortiporius may not be valid because it relies on the inexact dating of manuscripts and their transcriptions.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Geoffrey&#x27;s mention of Vortiporius is contained in a brief chapter titled &quot;Uortiporius, being declared king, conquers the Saxons&quot;. He says that Uortiporius succeeded Aurelius Conan, and after he was declared king, the Saxons rose against him and brought over their countrymen from Germany in a great fleet, but that these were defeated. Uortiporius then ruled peacefully for four years, beings succeeded by &quot;Malgo&quot; (Maelgwn Gwynedd). Geoffrey&#x27;s fertile imagination is the only source of this information.

&quot;The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales&quot;, an early 19th-century collection of Welsh histories, repeats Geoffrey&#x27;s account, referring to him as &#x27;Gwrthevyr&#x27; (though Vortiporius&#x27; proper Modern Welsh spelling is Gwrdebyr; here the name has been confused with that of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern). In his &quot;Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates&quot;, James Ussher also repeats the account, attributing the information to Geoffrey.

==Family==
Vortipor was a son of Aergol Lawhir, so a grandson of Triffyn Farfog. He had a son named Cyngar.

<text>The Northern Light Infantry Regiment (NLI) is a light infantry regiment in the Pakistan Army, based and currently headquartered in Gilgit, Pakistan. Along with other forces of the Pakistani military, the NLI has the primary responsibility of conducting ground operations in the interest of defending the strategically-important territory of Gilgit−Baltistan, a Pakistani-controlled region that constitutes part of Kashmir, which has been disputed between Pakistan and India since 1947. The NLI draws a majority of its recruits from native tribes present in the nearby mountainous areas who are reportedly less prone to altitude sickness and the cold temperatures that characterize high-altitude mountain warfare, allowing the regiment to conduct its duties optimally.

The Northern Light Infantry is best known for the extensive assistance and training it provided to the Afghan mujahideen (with backing from the CIA and ISI) during the Soviet–Afghan War.

==Formation==
The Northern Light Infantry has its origins in the Gilgit Scouts raised by British India in 1913 for defending the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s northern frontier. The Scouts, along with rebels in the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces, fought for Pakistan on the northern front of the First Kashmir War, conquering important points of interest such as Skardu, Kargil and Drass (the latter two were subsequently captured by the Indian Army). In 1949, the Gilgit Scouts were split into two forces, with the wing under the original name &#x27;Gilgit Scouts&#x27; designated for internal security operations, and a second wing, named the &#x27;Northern Scouts&#x27;, designated for major external operations. In 1964, the Northern Scouts were further bifurcated with the raising of the &#x27;Karakoram Scouts&#x27; based in Skardu. All three forces were brought together again in 1975, under the banner of the Northern Light Infantry (then a paramilitary force). Following the 1999 Kargil War with India, where the Northern Light Infantry saw extensive combat, the force was converted into a regular regiment of the Pakistan Army.

A new paramilitary force was created in 2003 under the name Gilgit−Baltistan Scouts to fill the internal security role of the former Gilgit Scouts.

==Status and composition==

Upon its founding, the Northern Light Infantry regiment was to function as a paramilitary force, at par with the Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Corps, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and commanded by regular Pakistan Army officers. In 1967 and 1970, two battalions of the NLI were airlifted and deployed to Karachi, Sindh, for internal security duties such as riot control and aiding civil authorities during an election-related period of violence. The regiment&#x27;s performance during this time earned them a commendation from Field Marshal Ayub Khan.

By 1998, the NLI consisted of 13 battalions commanded by a Major-General of the Pakistan Army under the designation of Inspector-General of the NLI, whose office was the Inspectorate-General of NLI reporting to the GOC, X Corps as well as the Pakistani Interior Minister.

== Notable operations ==

=== First Kashmir war(1947–1948) ===

Muhammad Baber Khan, the Honorary Captain, fought in the 1947–1948 Kashmir War. The British government gave the Maharaja of Kashmir control over Gilgit Agency upon partition. At Gilgit, Brigadier Ghansara Singh arrived to assume the role of Governor. Major General H L Scott, the Kashmiri chief of military staff, later joined as well. The Gilgit Scouts, who were all Muslim, supported Pakistan&#x27;s entry. Honorary Captain Muhammad Baber Khan convened a meeting of Gilgit scouts junior commissioned officers in the junior commissioned officers&#x27; mess on October 31, 1947, in the afternoon. At this meeting, it was resolved to overthrow the dogra rule. 

The governor gave himself up on November 1, 1947. The Muslim company of Captain Hassan Khan&#x27;s 6 Jammu Kahmir infantry battalion, which was traveling from Bunji to Gilgit, joined the scouts as well. The scouts set Partab Bridge on fire and attacked, destroying the dogra check post. After deserting, the Sikh and dogra components were apprehended. Consequently, 27000 square miles were freed from Dogra Raj. Major Muhammad Tufail Shaheed (Nishan-i-Haider), Honorary Captain Muhammad Baber Khan of the 1st Northern Light Infantory Regiment, who was instrumental in the 1947 fight of liberation from Dogra Raj, was then assigned as the force&#x27;s commander.

=== Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989) ===
Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan and Israel launched Operation Cyclone, in which they financed and armed the Afghan mujahideen to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a Soviet satellite state and subsequently threaten Pakistan (a U.S. ally in the Cold War). Here, with primarily Saudi Arabian and American financing, the Northern Light Infantry trained Afghan mujahideen fighters in Gilgit−Baltistan before sending them back to Afghanistan with state-of-the-art armaments to fight the Soviet military.

===Siachen Glacier Conflict (1984–2003)===

India&#x27;s 1984 seizure of the Siachen Glacier (an area of Kashmir that was uninhabited and not controlled by any parties to the Kashmir conflict) resulted renewed high-level tensions with Pakistan until a mutual ceasefire agreement was brought into effect in 2003. During this period of intermittent fighting in the Siachen conflict, the NLI&#x27;s 1st battalion performed defence and support work.

===Kargil War (1999)===
In May 1999, Pakistan began operations to occupy key Indian forward posts along the Line of Control (LoC), sparking the Kargil War. Initially Pakistan Army denied any involvement in the war. However, later on, it was reported that the Pakistan Army had launched forces exclusively from the Northern Light Infantry during this conflict. These included the 5th, 6th, 8th and 12th battalions in full strength and some elements of the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 11th battalions with the paramilitary Chitral and Bajaur Scouts, both of the Frontier Corps, deployed for logistical support.

Massive Indian counterattack coupled with heavy diplomatic pressure from the United States forced Pakistan to begin a withdrawal after months of intense fighting. Pakistani casualties during this conflict, like those of other Indo−Pakistani conflicts, remain disputed and unconfirmed. International sources (such as those from the U.S. Department of Defense) place Pakistani casualties at around 700+. After 11 years, Pakistan officially reported that around 453 of its soldiers were killed during the conflict. PM Nawaz Sharif and some other sources placed the Pakistani casualties figure from 2,700 to 4,000 personnel.

===Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (2004–present)===

The regiment has been taking part in counter-insurgency operations in North-West Pakistan. On 12 June 2013, the commanding officer of the 11th NLI battalion was killed in an IED attack during a military operation in Tirah Valley.

<text>The WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling championship in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) promotion. The title was challenged by light heavyweights at a maximum weight of 215 lbs (before deactivation, the weight limit was changed to 220 Ibs). It was created on March 26, 1981, for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) in a partnership between the WWF and UWA. On June 16, 1995, the title moved to Michinoku Pro Wrestling, but due to WWF&#x27;s ownership of the title, it was returned to the WWF in 1997, the year which WWE recognizes as the beginning of the championship&#x27;s lineage. The inaugural champion in UWA was Perro Aguayo, however, the WWE considers the inaugural champion to be Taka Michinoku, with his reign beginning on December 7, 1997. It was retired on March 8, 2002, with X-Pac as the final champion.

===Title deactivation===
In March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation purchased World Championship Wrestling. Following the conclusion of the Invasion angle at the 2001 Survivor Series pay-per-view, the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was abandoned in favor of the WCW Cruiserweight Championship (a unification match at Survivor Series was cancelled due to X-Pac&#x27;s injury). The Light Heavyweight Championship was defended by X-Pac at house shows until March 8, 2002, when WWF finally deactivated the title. Simultaneously, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship was rebranded as the WWF Cruiserweight Championship. It would become the WWE Cruiserweight Championship in accordance with the company&#x27;s name change in May 2002, and it would be defended until September 2007.

== Reigns ==

The WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was first introduced in Japan in a tournament which ended with Perro Aguayo defeating Gran Hamada to become the first recognized champion. It then migrated to the US West Coast before transitioning to Mexico and then later being defended once again in Japan by way of the Michinoku Pro Wrestling promotion. The title would later become popularized and widely defended within the confines of the World Wrestling Federation in 1997, when a tournament was held in the United States to crown a champion. Before the tournament, the title was previously considered a part of the much venerated J-Crown.

<text>Harvey Smith (born 1966) is an American video game designer and writer, working at Arkane Studios.

Smith has lectured in various places around the world on topics such as level design, emergent gameplay, leadership, game unit differentiation, future trends and interactive narrative. At the Game Developers Conference in 2006, Smith won the Game Designer&#x27;s Challenge: &quot;Nobel Peace Prize&quot;, for his design featuring a mobile video game that facilitates political social action.

==Early life==
Smith was born and raised on the Texas Gulf Coast. He grew up playing games like &quot;Pong&quot; as well as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He read books by Ursula K. Le Guin, William Faulkner, Vladimir Nabokov and Roger Zelazny, among others. He served six years in the U.S. Air Force, including tours in Germany and Saudi Arabia. Smith moved to Austin at the behest of a friend to try his hand at video game design.

==Career==
Early in his career, Smith worked in quality assurance (QA) at the Austin-based Origin Systems, where he became the QA lead for games including &quot;Super Wing Commander&quot; and &quot;System Shock&quot;. In 1995, Smith became an associate producer for &quot;Ultima VIII&quot;, working with co-founder of Origin, Richard Garriott. Smith then pitched his own game, &quot;Technosaur&quot;, a real time strategy game inspired by &quot;Dune&quot; that would have featured &quot;cybernetically augmented velociraptors&quot;. The project was canceled by publisher Electronic Arts after 18 months of work.

After leaving Origin in 1996, Harvey Smith went to work at Multitude where they released &quot;FireTeam&quot;.

After Multitude, Smith&#x27;s game development career continued in Austin, Texas working with Warren Spector at Ion Storm as lead designer on &quot;Deus Ex&quot; as well as its sequel, &quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot;. After this he unsuccessfully pitched a further game in the &quot;Thief&quot; series, to be called &quot;Thief: Modern&quot;, in which central character Garrett lived in modern-day New York.

Smith then left Ion Storm to work at Midway Games, originally to work on a title called &quot;Criminal&quot; with &quot;immersive sim values&quot; inspired by Michael Mann&#x27;s 1995 crime film &quot;Heat&quot;, but shifting ultimately to work as lead designer on &quot;&quot;. On November 29, 2007, Smith came out publicly to announce how unrealistic the &quot;BlackSite: Area 51&quot;&#x27;s development schedule was and through mutual agreement left Midway a day later. He claimed the schedule caused the low reviews due to the fact they were not able to test the game properly. 
In 2008, Smith became partner and co-creative director of Arkane Studios in Austin alongside the company&#x27;s president, Raphaël Colantonio. They went on to release the stealth-action game &quot;Dishonored&quot; in 2012, which won many Game of the Year and Best Action/Adventure accolades including the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game and 2012 SPIKE VGA for Best Action/Adventure Game. Smith also co-directed the sequel &quot;Dishonored 2&quot; and its standalone expansion &quot;.&quot; Smith is co-director on Arkane Austin&#x27;s &quot;Redfall&quot;, an open-world first person shooter, which released on May 2, 2023.

Smith&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Big Jack is Dead&quot;, was released on April 2, 2013, by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. That same year it was on Kirkus Review&#x27;s list of &quot;Best Indie General Fiction&quot;.

<doc id="985670" wikidata="Q3195417" url="?curid=985670" title="Keredic">
<text>Keredic () was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. The origin of Geoffrey&#x27;s character is unknown, but he is not depicted as a Saxon. According to Geoffrey, Keredic&#x27;s rule was so unpopular that the Saxons enlisted the aid of an army of Vandals from Ireland to drive him from his kingdom.

Geoffrey&#x27;s legendary Keredic may have been a conflation of Cerdic, the traditional founder of Wessex, who, despite his political affiliation with the Saxons, was likely to be half-British himself, and another Cerdic, who reigned over the Celtic kingdom of Elmet around present-day Leeds until his defeat at the hands of Edwin of Northumbria. Whatever the case, Geoffrey places a lengthy interregnum between the expulsion of Keredic and the rise of the next British king, Cadfan ap Iago.

Keredic should not be confused with Ceredig, one of the sons of Cunedda and traditional founder of Ceredigion.

<doc id="985678" wikidata="Q6130675" url="?curid=985678" title="James C. Christensen">
<text>James C. Christensen (September 26, 1942 – January 8, 2017) was an American illustrator and painter of religious and fantasy art.

Christensen was born and raised in Culver City, California. Christensen began his studies at Santa Monica College. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles and obtained a MFA from Brigham Young University (BYU). Christensen only started oil painting after he began studying at BYU.

==Career==
Christensen began his career as a free-lance illustrator and a junior high school art instructor. Christensen was an instructor at BYU from 1976 until 1997. He has had numerous showings of his work throughout the US and has been commissioned by media companies to create artwork for their publications, such as Time-Life Books and &quot;Omni&quot;.

Christensen appeared in an episode of ABC&#x27;s show &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; in 2005. He created a picture featuring a member of the family as a fairy. The design team filmed a segment at his studio. The Greenwich Workshop donated a framed Court of the Faeries that Christensen presented to the family for the room as well.

Christensen said his inspirations were myths, fables, fantasies, and tales of imagination. He employed many-layered medieval and Renaissance clothing, and hunched backs symbolizing the burdens people carry in life.

One his trademarks were flying or floating fish and he explained, &quot;In my paintings a fish usually symbolizes wonder and wisdom. I often paint a fish floating in the air to remind the viewer that this is a new reality, that there is magic in the world.&quot; He was approached by Pixar to consult on &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; but declined in order to work on a mural for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Christensen painted several murals for the Provo City Center Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

===Controversy===

Christensen&#x27;s book &quot;Voyage of the Basset&quot; was the source of controversy in 2006 when a resident of Bountiful, Utah, demanded that the book be removed from circulation from the young adult section at the Davis County Library in nearby Farmington, Utah because some of the illustrations were deemed too suggestive. The Davis County Library Board voted to keep the book in circulation in the young adult section.

==Personal life==
Christensen was married to Carole Christensen and they had five children including two artist daughters, Cassandra Barney and Emily McPhie. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Christensen co-chaired the Mormon Arts Foundation. In the Church, he served as a ward bishop among other callings. He resided in Orem, Utah in a house he designed filled with secret passages and sculptures inspired by his paintings. Christensen died of cancer on January 8, 2017.

<doc id="985687" wikidata="Q398267" url="?curid=985687" title="Honde Valley">
<text>The Honde Valley extends from the eastern border of Zimbabwe into Mozambique. The valley is part of the Eastern Highlands. The valley is about from Mutare, or from Nyanga. The Nyanga Mountains and the Nyanga National Park form the western boundary of the valley.

==Access==
Approaching from Mutare, the turn-off is about 50 km along the road towards Nyanga. The road into the valley is tarred and twists and turns steeply as it drops 800 meters in about 20 km. Off the tarred road, there are good dust roads which service most parts of the Valley.

==Geography==

===Climate===
The climate of Honde Valley falls is mostly temperate. From late October to around the end of April it is the summer months, the weather is hot and humid. Temperatures may rise up to 28 ˚C and this is the period where most of the rainfall is received. From May to the beginning of July winter season, the temperatures are very low and they may hover around minimums of 2 ˚C while From September to October during spring, it is hot with maximum temperatures averaging around 25 to 30 ˚C.
Most of the rainfall experienced is of the convectional type. At time orographic rainfalls at various times of the year, in addition to the normal convectional rainfall. This portion of the country, therefore, receives the highest rainfall in the country as it is located in Region 1 of the country&#x27;s 5 regions with region 1 receiving the largest amount of rainfall. As the area is in the highlands, winters tend to be very cold but overall the region has a very pleasant climate.

===Topography===
The average altitude of Honde Valley is around 900m above sea-level as compared to its immediate surroundings which rise above 1800m. This abrupt drop in topography creates the spectacular Mtarazi and adjacent Muchururu Falls, local tourist attractions.

===Flora===
The 500 square kilometres of the Honde Valley in Zimbabwe are extensively cultivated, often with gravity fed irrigation channels. Extensive use is made of the many smaller tributaries feeding into the Pungwe River in this portion of the Honde Valley.

===Fauna===
Honde Valley is one of the premier birding destinations in Zimbabwe, offers a wide range of species difficult to find in most other parts of the region, other than in neighbouring Mozambique. This fertile valley lies 850m above sea level and is one of the major tea producing areas of Zimbabwe.

Specials: Anchieta&#x27;s tchagra, moustached grass-warbler, red-winged warbler, black-winged bishop, red-faced crimsonwing, lesser seedcracker, singing cisticola, twinspot indigobird which parasitizes the red-throated twinspot, scarce swift, pallid honeyguide, green-backed woodpecker, stripe-cheeked greenbul, yellow-streaked greenbul, silvery-cheeked hornbill, white-eared barbet, pale batis, black-throated wattle-eye, variable sunbird, bronzy sunbird, olive sunbird, yellow-bellied waxbill, grey waxbill, blue-spotted wood-dove, black-fronted bush-shrike.

Habitats: Lowland and riverine forest, marsh, miombo woodland, tea estate, maize lands.

Birding: There are four main birding areas in the valley, the area around Aberfoyle Club; Gleneagles Nature Reserve above the Club, eastern Highland Tea Estate; and Katiyo Tea Estate some 25 km from Aberfoyle.

===Water resources===
The water supply for the Honde Valley comprises small piped systems and motorised pumps serving small towns, growth points, commercial plantations, service centres and some villages, as well as direct abstractions from the rivers by riparian village communities not connected to developed installations.

There are a total of about seven small to medium-sized metered piped water systems at Hauna, Sachisuko, Honde Army, Zindi, Samanga, Mpotedzi and Sahumani. In addition there are other smaller un-metered water supply schemes that serve a number of villages and schools. The known smaller un-metered water supply schemes are Honde “Povo” Pipe Scheme, Chingaira Piped Scheme, St Columbus Secondary School, Sagambe Primary and Secondary School, Marige Water Project, Mahobo Piped Scheme and Mupenga Gravity Water Scheme.

==Economy==
Since the area is low-lying and hot it is an abundant banana,tea and coffee growing area. The well known Katiyo, Aberfoyle, Rumbizi and Chiwira Tea Estates are among those situated in the valley. However, it is also home to many small scale and subsistence farmers who have since 2011 switched mainly to Banana production. There are several non-motorized irrigation schemes in Honde valley.

One of the main townships inside the valley is Hauna. Hauna Growth Point now has a community Hospital.

=== Electricity generation ===

Electricity generating projects have so far been put in place which are supplying ZESA namely the Nyamhingura, Duru, Pungwe A,B &amp; C and Hauna Power Stations. All plants are managed by Nyangani Renewable Energy (Pvt) Ltd, with an installed capacity of 27 MW; Annual average output of 80,000 Mwh.

<text>Companies House is the executive agency of the British Government that maintains the register of companies, employs the company registrars and is responsible for incorporating all forms of companies in the United Kingdom.

Prior to 1844, no central company register existed and companies could only be incorporated through letters patent and legislation. At the time, few incorporated companies existed; between 1801 and 1844, only about 100 companies were incorporated. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 created a centralised register of companies, enabled companies to be incorporated by registration, and established the office of the registrar; the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 mandated separate registrars for each of the three UK jurisdictions. Initially just a brand, Companies House became an official executive agency in 1988.

All public limited, private limited, private unlimited, chartered and some other companies are incorporated and registered with Companies House. The agency also registers limited partnerships, while most other enterprises fall under the purview of the Financial Conduct Authority. All limited companies (including subsidiary, small and inactive) must file annual financial statements with Companies House, all of which are public records. The agency is also responsible for dissolving companies.

From 2016, Companies House operated under the authority of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. This then became the Department for Business and Trade from 7 February 2023 following a Machinery of Government change initiated by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The current chief executive is Louise Smyth, who also serves as registrar for England and Wales. The agency, as well as British company law in general, are governed by the Companies Act 2006. Companies House maintains 5.32 million active companies.

==History==
=== 19th century ===

Prior to 1844, companies could only be incorporated through grant of a royal charter, by private act of Parliament, or, from 1834, by letters patent. Few companies were incorporated, with only approximately 100 companies being incorporated by private act between 1801 and 1844. At this time, no central register of companies was in existence.

==== Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 ====

The origins of Companies House date back to 1844, the year the Joint Stock Companies Act received royal assent, enabling companies to be incorporated by registration for the first time. The Act created the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies to maintain the register of companies, which was publicly accessible. It was hoped by MPs of the day that a publicly accessible central company register would help to protect the public from fraud. All companies, irrespective of their method of incorporation, were obliged to register within three months of the commencement of the Act.

The Act provided for two types of company registration: provisional, and complete. The filing requirements for complete registration were more extensive than those for provisional registration. Given that there was no requirement for companies granted a certificate of provisional registration to submit the remaining information in order to become completely registered, the Act was not hugely successful as many of its provisions applied only to completely registered companies.

The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 applied only to England and Wales, and Ireland; it did not apply to Scotland.
==== Limited Liability Act 1855 ====

Prior to the commencement of the Limited Liability Act 1855, shareholders were generally treated similarly to partners in a common law partnership, and had unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the companies in which they held shares. From 1855, it became possible for shareholders to benefit from limited liability as a matter of routine, provided the companies in which they held shares were registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies under the 1844 Act. The aim of this act was to incentivise the creation of new joint stock companies, while giving investors, the majority of whom did not play an active role in day-to-day management, protection from liabilities incurred by company directors.

==== Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 ====

The Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 abolished the dual registration system of the 1844 Act; provisional registration ceased to be possible. In exchange for providing shareholders with the benefit of limited liability, companies were required to submit certain information to the Registrar for Joint Stock Companies, including memoranda and articles of association (which had not previously been divided in this way), and annual reports.

The 1856 Act also mandated that there be a Registrar of Companies for each of the UK&#x27;s three jurisdictions. This system remains today, with a separate Registrar of Companies for England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland; &#x27;Companies House&#x27; is merely a brand adopted by the registrars.

Company registration in Scotland commenced in 1856, with the first company registered being the &quot;Daily Bulletin Company Limited&quot;, a newspaper publisher. The first Registrar of Joint Stock Companies for Scotland was George Deane, from 1856 to 1858, before he was transferred to the London office of Companies House to be Chief Clerk to the Registrar for England and Wales. The remaining staff were transferred to the office of the Queen&#x27;s and Lord Treasurer&#x27;s Remembrancer (Q&amp;LTR), who took on the role of Registrar of Companies for Scotland.

=== 20th century ===
In 1982 the post of Q&amp;LTR was transferred to the Crown Agent, and the staff and functions relating to company registration in Scotland were transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry on 1 April 1981.

In October 1988, Companies House became an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, and then in October 1991 started to operate as a trading fund, self-financing by retaining income from charges.

=== 21st century ===

==== Companies Act 2006 ====

When the Companies Act 2006 was fully implemented on 1 October 2009, the Northern Ireland companies register was fully integrated into Companies House; previously, all limited companies in Northern Ireland were registered with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.

As government departments were reorganised, Companies House came under the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (2007), the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2009), and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2016). Companies House was a member of the Public Data Group, an advisory board which between 2011 and 2015 sought to improve public access to government data.

Companies House is also responsible for dissolving companies.

In 2020, there were approximately 4.3 million businesses on the Companies House register. In the same year Companies House ceased to operate as a trading fund.
==== Response to 2020 pandemic ====
In view of the coronavirus pandemic, from 25 March 2020 companies were able to apply for a three-month extension to the annual deadline for filing their accounts and reports. The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 made this extension automatic for filing deadlines between 27 June 2020 and 5 April 2021; after the latter date, companies could again apply for a three-month extension. There were also temporary extensions to the deadlines for filing confirmation statements and certain event-driven filings.

==== Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 ====
The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, receiving royal assent on 26 October 2023 and coming into force on 4 March 2024, signifies a major legislative reform for Companies House. The Act aims to transform Companies House from a mere repository of documents into an entity that proactively supervises company registration procedures and plays a role in preventing economic crimes. Central to the act is the requirement for identity verification of individuals wishing to incorporate a company, including directors, people with significant control (PSCs), and members of Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs). This measure is set to apply to all new and existing directors and PSCs.

== Registrars of Companies ==
The role of Registrar of Companies is not a political one, and the incumbent is a civil servant.

===England and Wales===

The Registrar of Companies for England and Wales is based at Companies House, Cardiff, and is responsible for the registration of companies in England and Wales. Until 2011 there was another Companies House office in Nantgarw, Wales. The London office of Companies House, located at Petty France, is purely a facility to file and view documents, which are then processed in Cardiff. 

The current registrar is Louise Smyth, who is also chief executive of Companies House.

== Register of Companies ==
The Register of Companies is the index of every undertaking registered with Companies House.

=== Names ===
==== Uniqueness ====
Every undertaking registered with Companies House must have a unique name. Whether a name is unique or not is determined by Companies House; certain terms and punctuation, and characters after the first 60, are completely disregarded when assessing the uniqueness of a name, and other characters, although strictly different, are deemed to be the same as each other.

==== Restrictions ====
Companies may not have names which if used would constitute a criminal offence, or which are offensive. Approval from the Secretary of State is required if a company wishes to use a name indicating a connection to government, or other so-called &#x27;sensitive&#x27; words or phrases.

==== Indication of status ====
Generally, undertakings registered with Companies House are required to indicate their legal form in their names:

* Public limited companies, the names of which must end with &#x27;public limited company&#x27; or &#x27;plc&#x27;, or, in the case of Welsh companies if they so choose, the Welsh language equivalents &#x27;cwmni cyfyngedig cyhoeddus&#x27; or &#x27;ccc&#x27;
* Societates Europaeae, the names of which had to include &#x27;SE&#x27; (replaced with &#x27;UK Societas&#x27; for SEs remaining registered in the UK on 1 January 2021 as a consequence of Brexit)
* Private limited companies, the names of which ordinarily must end with &#x27;limited&#x27; or &#x27;ltd&#x27;, or, in the case of Welsh companies if they so choose, the Welsh language equivalents &#x27;cyfyngedig&#x27; or &#x27;cyf&#x27;
* Community interest companies, the names of which must end with &#x27;community interest company&#x27; or &#x27;cic&#x27; (or, if it is a public company, &#x27;community interest public limited company&#x27; or &#x27;community interest plc&#x27;), or, in the case of Welsh companies if they so choose, the Welsh language equivalents &#x27;cwmni buddiant cymunedol&#x27; or &#x27;cbc&#x27; (or, if it is a public company, &#x27;cwmni buddiant cymunedol cyhoeddus cyfyngedig&#x27; or &#x27;cwmni buddiant cymunedol ccc&#x27;)
* Limited partnerships, the names of which must end with &#x27;limited partnership&#x27; or &#x27;lp&#x27;, or if the principal place of business is Wales and they so choose, the Welsh language equivalents &#x27;partneriaeth cyfyngedig&#x27; or &#x27;pc&#x27;
* Limited liability partnerships, the names of which must end with &#x27;limited liability partnership&#x27; or &#x27;llp&#x27;, or in the case of Welsh limited liability partnerships if they so choose, the Welsh language equivalents &#x27;partneriaeth atebolrwydd cyfyngedig&#x27; or &#x27;pac&#x27;

Notwithstanding the above, private limited companies need not indicate their legal form in their names if they are charities, exempted by new regulations made by the Secretary of State, or subject to a continuing exemption.

=== Registered numbers ===
Every undertaking registered with Companies House is issued with a registered number. Once issued, a registered number remains the same, even if the undertaking changes its name.

Registered numbers consist of eight digits, and in certain circumstances a two letter prefix, including:

* Companies incorporated in Scotland: SC
* Companies incorporated in Northern Ireland: NI 
* Companies incorporated by royal charter: RC (England and Wales), SR (Scotland), or NR (Northern Ireland)
* Overseas companies: FC (England and Wales), SF (Scotland), or NF (Northern Ireland)
* Limited partnerships: LP (England and Wales), SL (Scotland), or NL (Northern Ireland) 
* Limited liability partnerships: OC (England and Wales), SO (Scotland), or NO (Northern Ireland) 
* European economic interest groupings: GE (England and Wales), GS (Scotland), or GN (Northern Ireland)

=== Certificates of incorporation or registration ===

==== Certificates of incorporation ====
The Register of Companies contains certificates of incorporation for all undertakings incorporated by registration with Companies House. Incorporation takes place on the issuance of a certificate of incorporation by the registrar. Private limited companies can be issued with a certificate of incorporation within 24 hours of an application being submitted.

Certificates of incorporation for companies include the following information:

* Registered name
* Registered number 
* Date of incorporation
* Whether the company is limited or unlimited, and if limited, whether by shares or guarantee
* Whether the company is private or public
* Whether the company&#x27;s registered office is in England and Wales, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland

Registration of companies is complete once the certificate of incorporation is signed or sealed by the registrar.

Certificates of incorporation for limited liability partnerships include the following information:

* Registered name
* Registered number
* Date of incorporation
* Whether the limited liability partnership&#x27;s registered office is in England and Wales, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland

Incorporation of a limited liability partnerships is complete once the certificate of incorporation is signed or sealed by the registrar.

==== Certificates of registration ====
Limited partnerships are not issued with certificate of incorporation upon registration with Companies House, but instead with certificates of registration. This is because limited partnerships are not legal persons and therefore are not created by incorporation.

Certificates of registration include the following information:

* Registered name
* Registered number
* Date of registration 
* A statement that the limited partnership is registered as a limited partnership under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907

A limited partnership comes into existence once its certificate of registration has been signed or sealed by the registrar.

=== Accuracy ===
Companies House does not verify the accuracy of information filed. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy announced in 2020 that Companies House would be given powers to verify the identities of company directors, but did not set a timetable for their introduction.

=== Other public registers ===
Since June 2016, private companies can elect to keep certain statutory records on the central register which is held and published by Companies House, instead of maintaining their own registers. These records include:

* Register of members
* Register of people with significant control
* Register of directors
* Register of directors&#x27; usual residential addresses
* Register of secretaries

== Controversy ==
In February 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; broke a story that almost 4,000 of the names on the Companies House register of directors were on international watchlists of alleged fraudsters, money launderers, terror financiers and corrupt officials. The results came from Datanomic who had screened the 6.8 million names on the register against a World-Check database of high risk individuals and businesses. The exercise also revealed more than 1,500 disqualified company directors were being allowed to run other UK companies as Companies House was not checking names against its register of disqualified persons.

<doc id="985694" wikidata="Q5689461" url="?curid=985694" title="Head race">
<text>A head race is a time-trial competition in the sport of rowing. Head races are typically held in the fall, winter and spring seasons. These events draw many athletes as well as observers. In this form of racing, rowers race against the clock where the crew or rower completing the course in the shortest time in their age, ability and boat-class category is deemed the winner.

==Categories==

Common categories of age may be high school and college-aged rowers as well as adults. Those over the age of 27 are typically referred to as &quot;masters&quot;.

Common categories of ability may be:
* junior-varsity boys and girls
* varsity boys and girls
* novice women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s, or mixed
* women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s among college-aged rowers
* novice, club, intermediate, elite and championship among masters-aged rowers; also differentiated by women, men, or mixed.

Common categories of boat class may be:
*1x: one rower with two oars, known as a single sculler
*2x: two rowers with two oars each, known as a double scull
*4x: four rowers with two oars each, known as a quad scull
*Coxless pair: Two rowers with one oar each (see sweep rowing)
*4+: Four rowers with one oar each and a coxswain
*8+: Eight rowers with one oar each and a coxswain

To minimize collisions, boats are started at 10 to 15 second intervals and are usually seeded so that the fastest start earlier.

==Races==
The length of most head races is usually between 4 km and 10 km. Among the most well-known are the Head of the River Race that takes place each March on the river Thames in London, United Kingdom, the Head of the Charles race held each October on the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts, United States., and the 8 km Head of the Yarra race held each November on the Yarra River in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Other notable head races include the Head of the Hooch, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Head of the Trent in Peterborough, Ontario along the Trent-Severn Waterway; the Head of the Rideau in Ottawa, Ontario, in March; the Head of the Lake through the Montlake Cut in Seattle, Washington; the Fremont 4-Miler also in Seattle, Washington (last held in 2007); the 3 mile Head of the Ohio in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania held annually since 1986 along the Forks of the Ohio River; the 3 mile Head of the Schuylkill in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Head of the Fish in Saratoga Springs, New York.

In the Netherlands the best known Head race is the Head of the River Amstel every year in March. Another, less well known Head race is the Eemhead, on the river Eem, which is rowed upstream the river and finishes at the boathouse of the organizing boat club, Hemus in Amersfoort. An indoor rower race inspired on the Head of the river Amstel is the Ergohead, organized every year in January by the Amsterdam boat club &#x27;De Amstel&#x27;. Initially it was a race over 6 virtual kilometers, and from the second time it was a race during 20 minutes, and the winner is the competitor who &#x27;rowed&#x27; the longest distance.

Two of the longest head races is the 100 km Ringvaart Regatta in the Netherlands. and the 20 km Göta Älvrodden in Gothenburg, Sweden.

<text>Cadfan ap Iago (c. 569 – c. 625) was King of Gwynedd (reigned c. 616 – c. 625). Little is known of the history of Gwynedd from this period, and information about Cadfan and his reign is minimal.

The historical person is known only from his appearance in royal genealogies, from his grant to Saint Beuno for the monastery at Clynnog Fawr, and from his inscribed gravestone in St Cadwaladr&#x27;s Church, Llangadwaladr.

Cadfan was the son and successor of King Iago ap Beli and is listed in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies and in Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20. Cadfan came to the throne near the time of the Battle of Chester () in 616, in which the Northumbrians under Æthelfrith decisively defeated the neighboring Welsh Kingdom of Powys and then massacred the monks of Bangor Is Coed. However, there is no evidence that Gwynedd had any part in the battle, so Cadfan&#x27;s accession at that time appears to be no more than coincidence.

Cadfan was succeeded as king by his son, Cadwallon ap Cadfan.

== Gravestone ==
Cadfan&#x27;s gravestone is at Llangadwaladr () on Anglesey, a short distance from the ancient &quot;llys&quot; () of the kings of Gwynedd, and reputed to be their royal burial ground. The inscription refers to him as &quot;sapientisimus&quot; (), and as this term is historically used for ecclesiastics, it suggests that at some point, Cadfan had resigned as king to live a consecrated life.

== Saint Beuno ==
Saint Beuno and the monastery at Clynnog Fawr are often cited in conjunction with Cadfan. An 1828 article by 
P. B. Williams in the &quot;Cymmrodorion&quot; cited a manuscript stating that a local prince named &#x27;Gwytheint&#x27; gave Clynnog Fawr to God and Saint Beuno, who was then Abbot at the monastery at Clynnog, and that the donation was free from taxes and obligations forever. It goes on to say that Beuno founded a convent at Clynnog in 616 and that Cadfan was Beuno&#x27;s great patron, promising him extensive lands. The promise was carried out by Cadfan&#x27;s son, King Cadwallon, and that Cadwallon was given a golden sceptre worth 60 cows as a token of acknowledgment. (&quot;Life of Saint Beino&quot;) (Rees was the editor of the 1828 &quot;Cymmrodorion&quot; that published P. B. Williams&#x27; account.)

There are minor variations of these accounts, sometimes with the details rearranged, such as in Rice Rees&#x27; 1836, &quot;Essay on the Welsh Saints&quot;, where he says that Cadfan (rather than his son Cadwallon) was given the golden sceptre by Beuno.

== Fictionalization by and after Geoffrey of Monmouth ==
The largely fictional stories of ancient Britain written by Geoffrey of Monmouth use the names of many historical personages as characters, and the use of these names is a literary convenience made in order to advance the plot of Geoffrey&#x27;s stories. One of these stories uses the names of Cadfan and other contemporary people, telling of how a certain Edwin spent his exiled youth at the court of King Cadfan, growing up alongside Cadfan&#x27;s son, the future King Cadwallon. There is no historical basis for this story, as is readily acknowledged in the preface of works on the subject.

Nevertheless, a &quot;traditional&quot; story arose blending Geoffrey&#x27;s fiction with known history, implying that the future King Edwin of Northumbria had actually spent his youth at the court of King Cadfan, growing up alongside Cadfan&#x27;s son, the future King Cadwallon. In point of fact, Cadwallon and Edwin were enemies with no known youthful connections: King Edwin invaded Gwynedd and drove King Cadwallon into exile, and it would be Cadwallon, in alliance with Penda of Mercia, who would ultimately defeat and kill Edwin in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase (). The story that they had spent an idyllic youth together may have had a romantic appeal.

What is known from history is that in 588 King Ælla of Deira died, and Æthelfrith of Bernicia took the opportunity to invade and conquer Deira, driving Ælla&#x27;s 3-year old infant son, the future Edwin of Northumbria, into exile. Edwin would eventually ally himself with Rædwald of East Anglia in 616, defeating and killing Æthelfrith and becoming one of Northumbria&#x27;s most successful kings. Edwin&#x27;s life in exile is unknown, and there is no historical basis for placing him at the court of King Cadfan.

<doc id="985708" wikidata="Q573460" url="?curid=985708" title="Askeaton">
<text>Askeaton (, Waterfall of Géitine, also historically spelt Askettin) is a town in County Limerick, Ireland. The town is built on the banks of the River Deel which flows into the Shannon Estuary 3 km to the north. Askeaton is on the N69 road between Limerick and Tralee; it is 25 km west of Limerick and 8 km north of Rathkeale. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

Among the historic structures in the town are a castle dating from 1199 and a Franciscan friary dating from 1389. The castle was abandoned to the English in 1580 – its walls blown up by the fleeing defenders – after the fall of Carrigafoyle Castle during the Desmond Rebellions. Askeaton was a constituency in the Irish House of Commons represented by two members until the dissolution of the parliament in 1801.

== Desmond Castle ==

The focal point of the town is Desmond Castle, which stands in the center of the town on a rocky island on the river Deel. A castle has been located at Askeaton since 1199, when it was given to Hamo de Valoignes, the Justiciary of Ireland between 1197 and 1199. In the &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot;, William de Burgo is recorded as having been granted the castle and estates by Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Thomond.

In 1348, Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond paid 40 shillings for the barony of Lystifti. The building that stands today dates from that time. The Earls of Desmond were to become a powerful presence in Munster, of whom it was said that they had become &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot; – they lived like Irish clan chiefs, following the Brehon Law, dressed in the Irish manner, spoke Munster Irish, played Irish traditional music and Gaelic games, rode and hunted, and offered hospitality to poets in return for praise poetry. 

The family had generations of clan warfare against the Clan MacCarthy to the south in Cork and Kerry and against their mortal Hiberno-Norman enemies, the House of Butler Earls of Ormond.

The earliest written reference to the castle appears in &quot;Leabhar nan Ceart&quot;, in English &quot;The Book of Rights&quot;, compiled in the 15th century, in which the fort of &quot;Gephtine&quot; is mentioned as being reserved to the King of Cashel.

The Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds, held possession of the castle for over 200 years; it was the centre of their power, and they ruled Munster from it. The tragic Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, had a powerful stronghold at Askeaton in 1559. 

The English launched a policy of total war and scorched earth upon the Irish clans who rebelled across the whole Munster. Gerald, known as &quot;The Rebel Earl&quot;, was at first very popular among his followers, but as the atrocities of the Tudor army caused mass starvation throughout the region, the clans of Munster gradually abandoned the Earl&#x27;s banner. Fleeing with a few retainers, on 11 November 1583 he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at Bóthar an Iarlaigh.

Sir Nicholas Malby unsuccessfully attacked the castle in 1579. 

During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Askeaton Castle was occupied by Lieutenant Patrick Purcell of the confederate Catholics. The Roundheads saw Askeaton as a threat while it was under Catholic control. It was destroyed in 1652 by New Model Army Captain Daniel Axtell, who also hanged Lt. Patrick Purcell. The Lord Justice Sir William Pelham subsequently took possession. It was the end of the FitzGerald reign over Askeaton and Munster.

The castle was transferred to the ownership of the English crown under Captain Edward Berkley.

== Franciscan Friary ==
Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond is said still to sleep in a cave waiting to ride back on his silver-shod steed in Ireland&#x27;s time of ultimate need, founded Askeaton Abbey in about 1389. It has cloisters with 12 arches on each side, an east window, mediaeval carvings, and a chapter room that is the final resting place of the martyrs Bishop Patrick O&#x27;Healy and Fr Conn O&#x27;Rourke.

On 9 October 1579, after failing to take Askeaton Castle, the English commander Sir Nicholas Malby attacked the town and burned the friary, killing most of the friars, some in a gruesome fashion, and wrecked the ancestral tombs of the Desmonds, in a mean-spirited attack to take revenge on the earl in his impenetrable fortress. Monks returned to the friary only in 1627 but the community did not reach its former numbers until 1642. The community again abandoned the site in 1648 when Cromwell&#x27;s forces neared Askeaton, and did not return until the 1650s. The friary permanently closed in 1740.

== St Mary&#x27;s Church ==

The present Catholic church was built in 1851, after the previous building near the Franciscan friary was totally destroyed by fire in 1847. It is built of local limestone and has stained glass windows. The window to the right of the transept shows the resurrection of Christ, and that on the left his ascension into heaven. In the centre of the nave are windows showing St Patrick receiving the two daughters of King Laoire, the King of Ireland, into the church, and Jesus with children, and over the main door of the church a window shows the Virgin Mary. Over the door is a statue of the Pieta.

The Church of Ireland also has a church in the town, St Mary&#x27;s, with a clergyman resident in Rathkeale.

== Hellfire Club ==

East of the castle is the remains of the Hellfire Club, an almost intact redbrick building built in 1740 (the same year the monks abandoned the nearby friary).

This bizarre secret society was founded in Dublin in 1735 by the Earl of Rosse, first Grand Master of the Irish Freemasons. It is one of two in Ireland (the other is outside Dublin). The Hellfire Clubs, throughout Ireland and Britain, were 18th-century clubs where rich men gathered to drink, gamble, and allegedly have mock crucifixions and homosexual orgies. 

Lurid rumours around Hellfire Clubs included visits by the devil and human sacrifice. These clubs popularised the combination of whiskey, butter and cream mulled by a red-hot poker known as &quot;scaltheen&quot;. The club closed down by 1800. The façade of the building collapsed in the 1990s.

== Community hall ==

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the community organisation &quot;Muintir na Tíre&quot; built a community hall for the parish. Built in a time of economic depression, it was constructed with the voluntary labour of local people. It became a focal point in the social life of the town, used for dances, concerts and bingo. It replaced the library (which was too small) as a dance hall. It was also used as a national school while the new building was being built in 1962/63, and as a church when masses were held there during the 1977 refurbishment of St Mary&#x27;s Catholic church.

== Transport ==
The railway line that passes through the now closed Askeaton railway station was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857. The Limerick–Foynes railway line had stations at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton. The railway line to Foynes passes north of the town, but Askeaton railway station was closed to passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and freight on 2 December 1974, when the station closed. 

Trains for Foynes continued to pass through Askeaton until the line effectively lost all its freight services in 2000. In an interview on Limerick&#x27;s Live 95fm on 18 April 2011, Kay McGuinness, chair of Shannon Foynes Port Company, said that they were confident that the rail link could be reopened. A subsequent campaign by the residents of Station Road focused on preventing Iarnród Éireann from removing the railway gates at the station.

There are plans to reopen the line on time for 2027 Ryder Cup.

== Sport and culture ==

Askeaton GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the village. Munster football championship games, known as Páirc na nGael, were held on the club&#x27;s pitch in 1970 and between 1987 and 1991.

Askeaton Contemporary Arts is an artists&#x27; residency programme that has taken place in Askeaton each summer since 2006.

<doc id="985715" wikidata="Q11703779" url="?curid=985715" title="Setzer Gabbiani">
<text>is a character introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square Enix. A gambler with an airship casino, he originally plots to kidnap the starlet of an opera, before he is coerced into joining the protagonists in their quest to stop the game&#x27;s Gestahlian Empire. Created by Tetsuya Nomura, he was based on a character class he had originally planned for the game&#x27;s preceding title, &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;. He has since appeared in other titles related to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, where he is voiced by Crispin Freeman in English, and Ryōtarō Okiayu in Japanese.

Reviewers regarded Setzer as one of the best characters in the game due to his personality and nature, and unique among the series due to being driven by his own desires and ambitions. However this has also earned him some criticism, seen as a &quot;scumbag&quot; by some reviewers, albeit one that improves once he joins the rest of the game&#x27;s playable cast. Particular praise was given to his story in the game&#x27;s second half, where he shares a personal tragedy, a moment that some saw as providing much-needed humanization for his character.

==Appearances==
Setzer Gabbiani is a character in the 1994 Square Enix video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Fighting using dice, darts and thrown playing cards, he is a renowned gambler and owner of the Blackjack, an airship-based casino. The protagonists, in need of an airship, discover that he plans to kidnap the star of an upcoming opera. Realizing one of the women in their group, Celes, resembles the starlet, she poses as her to entrap Setzer. When he arrives, she makes a coin-flip wager with him that she&#x27;ll go with him if he wins, and if he loses he joins the protagonists in their opposition of the game&#x27;s Gestahlian Empire. Setzer agrees and loses the wager, though upon discovering it was a two-headed coin joins the group regardless, both due to the harm the Empire is doing to his lifestyle and respecting Celes&#x27; willingness to use underhanded tactics.

However, at the conclusion of the game&#x27;s first half the world has been devastated, the party separated, and the Blackjack destroyed. Celes finds Setzer drinking heavily in despair, but encourages him to keep going. He takes the group to the tomb of his friend Darril and reveals his past as they descend the staircase into it: originally, the two of them used their airships to compete to be the fastest people in the world. However, her ship crashed after a test flight, and Setzer recovered it and rebuilt it at the site of her grave. Her ship taking flight once more with Setzer in command, the group proceeds to try and find the rest of their allies to take on the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Kefka.

In other games, Setzer appears as a playable character in &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;, and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as the reigning champion of the false Twilight Town&#x27;s Struggle tournament, where he fights the character Roxas. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, he is voiced by Ryōtarō Okiayu in Japanese and Crispin Freeman in English, with Okiayu reprising the role for &quot;Opera Omnia&quot;. Outside of video games, cards representing Setzer have been produced for the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;.

==Conception and design==
&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was developed with the mindset that none of the playable cast was the protagonist, and that each of them were equally the &quot;main character&quot;. The cast of characters were selected from submissions from across the development team, with artist Tetsuya Nomura contributing the character based on a character concept he had wanted to use previously. Once the cast was selected, each individual would write their character&#x27;s story, with Yoshinori Kitase balancing the plot as things developed.

Standing 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall, an early draft of the character&#x27;s appearance was drawn by Nomura, while Yoshitaka Amano was commissioned to design the characters from the brief outlines provided. Given full creative freedom, Amano wanted to make &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation in-game as small computer sprites. Said graphics were designed by Nomura, who drew the chibi artwork of the characters, and Kazuko Shibuya, who designed the in-game sprites. Setzer appears as a pale man with long white hair, a black suit with lavender boots, and a black jacket with a gold trim. He additionally has a blue sash around his waist, and a white ascot on his neck. His face and body are heavily scarred, due to &quot;accidents on the airship&quot; but also to reflect the difficulties of his life as a gambler.

The Gambler concept was originally a character class intended for &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, however the team felt it had too much &quot;individuality&quot;. When work began on &quot;VI&quot; Nomura felt it was more suitable there as the game&#x27;s theme was to highlight the individuality of the cast. In terms of personality, he is described as someone calm in almost any situation and in control of their emotions, though tends to use &quot;clumsy phrasing&quot;, sometimes on purpose. Additionally they wanted Setzer to put heavy emphasis on his sense of fashion, and desire to have a unique look, similar in attitude to a rock and roll musician. One particular way to illustrate this was with a Bandana item the character has in his inventory, despite being unable to equip it; the team intended it as environmental storytelling, where Setzer, upon seeing the character Locke also wearing a bandana, refuses to wear it again to not share the same style.

Setzer&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; was a last minute change, as scenario writer Kazushige Nojima originally planned to use the character Rufus Shinra from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. But as the scenes were already being completed, Nomura stated he felt they were using too many characters from &quot;VII&quot;, and suggested using Setzer instead. Nojima was unfamiliar with the character, but agreed nonetheless.

==Promotion and reception==
A keychain figure based on his chibi artwork was also produced by Bandai, as part of a series to promote the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. In 2014, added an outfit to &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; for male players that would change their appearance to match Setzer&#x27;s, as part of the game&#x27;s &quot;Gold Saucer&quot; event.

Setzer received mostly positive reception since his debut. Dave Smith of &quot;IGN&quot; considered him the best of the male protagonists in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, stating he had the &quot;most crucial of qualities in a hero, an unshakable sense of humor&quot; in light of how he joins the party in the game. &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Luis Mauricio praised him as being &quot;different and unexpected&quot;, an aspect he felt made him stand out amongst &quot;VI&quot;″s cast as a whole. Praising his role in the plot and his choice of weapons, he felt Setzer was a character &quot;propelled by adventure&quot; with a distinct look that tied well to his gambler image, adding &quot;He may be vain and proud, but he somehow manages to be utterly fascinating.&quot; Tom Slattery, who oversaw the re-localization of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, compared him to &quot;Star Wars&quot; hero Han Solo, emphasizing that while Setzer doesn&#x27;t necessarily want to join the party&#x27;s rebellion, his hatred for the empire and &quot;hopes of getting the girl&quot; were particular motivations he saw in both characters. Meanwhile, Setzer&#x27;s motivations being in response to the loss of Darill and the subsequent return to her tomb in the game&#x27;s second half have been praised as some of the game&#x27;s best aspects.

In the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Pierre Maugein described him as &quot;the embodiment of the non-conformist character showcasing his complete freedom&quot; despite his gambling addiction. He added that while the character had known tragedy like most of the cast, unlike them he was more trying to escape his past. Maugein felt his hedonism in an effort to &quot;feel alive&quot; made him a unique character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He noted specifically the moment where he wagers his freedom against taking Celes for himself as an example of this; even though he loses the rigged coin flip, his excitement is satisfied. Maugein added that while initially Setzer only joins with the protagonists not out of a care for the world but because the Empire is a threat to his wealth, he appears to use the party to define a new motivation to live for himself, particularly after he overcomes his mourning for Darill.
Sebastian Deken in his book examining &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and its themes described him as &quot;objectively&quot; a scumbag, citing his involvement with the Empire, his focus on money, and his the implications of his ambitions to kidnap Celes. However, he acknowledged that once he joins with the group he does reform somewhat, putting his prized possessions and even his body on the line for them, something he felt illustrated Setzer&#x27;s growth and atonement for his past character. He expressed the scene of him reminiscing about Darill was less about necessity for the plot, as he saw it entirely reasonable to build another airship on his own, and instead a story element used to humanize him somewhat, leaving him still a scumbag, but one &quot;with a heart&quot;. The staff of &quot;RPGFan&quot; shared this sentiment in a podcast retrospective of the game, stating that prior to it while he had little characterization out of seeming like a womanizer, it provided a &quot;powerful and moving&quot; moment to his character as the descent down the staircase into the tomb became symbolic of Setzer&#x27;s own descent into his memories.

When examining the iterations of his musical theme, Deken felt that played further into the aforementioned humanizing aspect, particularly its use during the Darill memory sequence. Describing it as &quot;Williamsesque&quot; and &quot;sonic adrenaline&quot;, he stated this was expressed with its trumpet melody and &quot;quick moving&quot; strings, painting Setzer as a daredevil. However its reuse as &quot;Epitaph&quot;, a slower paced rendition with slightly altered rhythm as the heroes descend into the tomb, felt more similar Led Zeppelin’s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Deken added it presented a tonal shift for Setzer&#x27;s character, with his brashness becoming tender while his cavalier solemn, and something Deken felt he &quot;desperately needs&quot; as a character in light of his other aspects. Patrick Holleman in the book &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VI&quot; meanwhile described it as a &quot;charmingly nostalgic piece that, much like the feeling of nostalgia, doesn’t resolve&quot;, praising composer Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s use of musical chords for this effect. He further felt that for as much personality as it gave Setzer, he considered it a shame this variation of his theme only played once during the course of the game.

<text>The World Tag Team Championship, originally known as the WWWF World Tag Team Championship, was a professional wrestling world tag team championship in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The title had various names over the years due to company name changes, from its establishment in 1971 in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979, and then WWE in 2002; the championship took on its final unbranded name later that same year. In April 2009, it was unified with the WWE Tag Team Championship, with the two titles together then recognized as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship while remaining independently active. On August 16, 2010, however, the World Tag Team Championship was decommissioned in favor of continuing the lineage of the WWE Tag Team Championship (which became the Raw Tag Team Championship in 2016 before assuming the name of World Tag Team Championship in 2024).

There were a total of 176 reigns between 113 teams composed of 164 individual champions, and nine vacancies. The first champions were Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler and the final champions were The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd). The team with the most reigns was The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) with eight, while individually, Edge had the most at 12. Only two tag teams held the title for 365 or more days: Demolition (Ax and Smash), whose first reign was the longest reign for the title at 478 days, and The Valiant Brothers (Jimmy Valiant and Johnny Valiant). As a team, Demolition also had the longest combined reign at 698 days across three reigns, while individually, Mr. Fuji had the longest combined reign at 932 days across five reigns.

The following is a chronological list of teams that have been World Tag Team Champions by ring name.

<text>The WWE United States Championship is a professional wrestling championship contested in the American promotion WWE on the SmackDown brand. It was originally known as the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship and began as a regional championship created by and defended in Jim Crockett Jr.&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Harley Race became the inaugural champion on the title&#x27;s introduction on January 1, 1975. Turner Broadcasting bought Mid-Atlantic in November 1988 and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after its primary television program.

In March 2001, the then-WWF bought selected assets of WCW. This resulted in the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship becoming a championship for the WWF, which referred to it as the WCW United States Championship. At Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW United States and WWF Intercontinental Championships were unified, resulting in the United States Championship being deactivated. In July 2003, the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship. It is the only active WWE championship not created by the promotion. As of the 2023 WWE Draft it is exclusive to the SmackDown brand. 

The championship is contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name, while others used their real name. Shinsuke Nakamura is the current champion in his third reign. He defeated LA Knight at Survivor Series: WarGames on November 30, 2024, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Overall, there have been 103 different champions. Ric Flair holds the record for having the most reigns at six, while John Cena holds the record for most reigns under the WWE banner at five. Lex Luger holds the longest reign, with his third reign lasting 523 days, while Dean Ambrose holds the longest reign under the WWE banner at 351 days (overall the third longest in the title&#x27;s history). &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin&#x27;s second reign was the shortest, lasting approximately five minutes. Only two men, Lex Luger and Rick Rude, have held the championship continuously for one year (365 days) or more.

<text>The WWE European Championship is a former professional wrestling title competed for in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The title was created on February 26, 1997. The first champion was The British Bulldog who defeated Owen Hart in a tournament final. The title was retired briefly in April 1999 by then-champion Shane McMahon, who wanted to retire as an &quot;undefeated champion&quot;. McMahon reintroduced the championship two months later and gave it to Mideon, who saw the title belt in Shane&#x27;s travel bag and asked if he could have it. The title was finally retired on July 22, 2002, when WWE Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated European Champion Jeff Hardy to unify the European title into the Intercontinental title. Throughout the five year, four month, and 26 day history of the title, there were 27 recognized champions and 37 distinct championship reigns. This is a chronological list of wrestlers that have been WWE European Champion by ring name.

<doc id="985727" wikidata="Q6603695" url="?curid=985727" title="List of WWF Light Heavyweight Champions">
<text>The WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling cruiserweight championship operated by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Only wrestlers that weighed less than , called &quot;light heavyweights&quot; by the WWF, were allowed to challenge for the title. From 1981 through the 1990s, the WWF had a business partnership with the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), a Mexican-based lucha libre promotion, which resulted in the creation of the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship for the UWA. When the UWA ceased operations in 1995, the title traveled to the Japanese promotions Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). In 1997, as a result of the WWF owning the trademarks to the championship, NJPW was forced to return the title to the WWF. One month later, the WWF began operating the title in the United States. After World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and its assets were acquired by the WWF in March 2001, the conceptually similar WCW Cruiserweight Championship was also used by the promotion, before completely replacing the Light Heavyweight Championship in 2002.

Title reigns were determined by professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines or were awarded the title due to scripted circumstances. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a match or series of matches for the championship. The title was won in Japan, Mexico, and 11 American states. The first champion to be recognized by the UWA and NJPW was Perro Aguayo, who won the title in a tournament final in March 1981. Shinjiro Otani was the final champion recognized by the NJPW before the title was returned to the WWF; he had won the title in August 1997. Although his reign is unrecognized by the WWF, Último Dragón is the only wrestler to hold a WWF championship and a WCW championship at the same time before WWF&#x27;s purchase of WCW, having held the WWF Light Heavyweight and WCW Cruiserweight championships simultaneously in 1996. The first champion recognized by the WWF was Taka Michinoku, who won the title in a tournament final on December 7, 1997. After winning the championship in August 2001, X-Pac was the final wrestler to have held the title before it was replaced by the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Aguayo and Villano III held the title the most times, with eight reigns each. At 826 days, Villano III&#x27;s reign from 1984 to 1986 was the longest in the title&#x27;s history. Perro Aguayo and Scotty 2 Hotty had the shortest reigns, each having reigns lasting eight days. Overall, there were 45 title reigns in the championship&#x27;s history.

<text>Manyika is a Shona language largely spoken by the Manyika tribe in the eastern part of Zimbabwe and across the border in Mozambique. It includes dialects ChiBocha, ChiUngwe, and ChiManyika, from which the broad Manyika language gets its name.

ChiManyika is spoken by people in the northern parts of Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe, (Nyanga, Honde Valley Mutasa area) whilst ChiBocha is spoken by people in the southern part of Manicaland. Manyika differs from Karanga and Zezuru dialects in a variety of small ways.

==Characteristics==
Certain variations in vocabulary and word prefixes exist. For example, the prefix &#x27;va-&#x27; (used in Shona before male names to signify seniority and respect) is replaced by &#x27;sa-&#x27; in the Manyika language. Also the prefix &#x27;va-&#x27; used as in people, for example standard Shona &quot;vanhu vakaenda vakawanda&quot;, is replaced by &#x27;wa-&#x27; to become &quot;wanhu wakaenda wakawanda&quot;. As a result, the Manyika do not use the prefix &#x27;va&#x27; in any form as they pronounce it as either &#x27;sa&#x27; or &#x27;wa&#x27;. This is how they are generally recognised as being Manyika.

The verbs in this language are tonally divided into two groups. The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to one group are as shown below in the case of the infinitive, which has ku- as its prefix:
*&quot;kupá&quot; &#x27;to give&#x27;, &quot;kubátá&quot; &#x27;to catch&#x27;, &quot;kupómérá&quot; &#x27;to scold&#x27;, &quot;kukúrúdzíra&quot; &#x27;to encourage&#x27;;
*&quot;ku&#x27;umúpá&quot; &#x27;to give him (something)&#x27;, &quot;kumúbátá&quot; &#x27;to catch him&#x27;, &quot;kumúpómérá&quot;, &quot;kumúkúrúdzíra&quot;;
*&quot;kuzvípa&quot; &#x27;to give (something to) oneself&#x27;, &quot;kuzvíbatá&quot; &#x27;to catch oneself&#x27;, &quot;kuzvípomerá&quot;, &quot;kuzvíkurudzirá&quot;.

These tonal patterns can be represented by kuCV’CV’CV’X, kuÓCV’CV’CV’X, kuŔXCá, where X stands for a string of phonemes of any length, O for an object prefix, and R for a reflexive prefix, with an adjustment rule to the first two formulae that if X=Ø, the last CV’ can be Ø, and if both are Ø, the second CV’ can also be Ø, and with one to the last formula that if X=Ø, Cá becomes Ca.

The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to the other group are as shown below:
*&quot;kubwa&quot; &#x27;to leave&#x27;, &quot;kumutsa&quot; &#x27;to wake up&#x27;, &quot;kutarisa&quot; &#x27;to look at&#x27;, &quot;kuswatanudza&quot; &#x27;to make (somebody) stand up&#x27;;
*&quot;kumúmútsa&quot;, &quot;kumútárisa&quot;, &quot;kumúswátanudza&quot;;
*&quot;kuzvímutsá&quot;, &quot;kuzvítarisá&quot;, &quot;kuzvíswatanudzá&quot;.

The tonal representation would be: kuX, kuÓCV’X, kuŔXCá.

This language has many indicative tenses (such as Remote Past, Recent Past, Past Progressive, Present, etc.) including negative ones.

<doc id="985751" wikidata="Q2303331" url="?curid=985751" title="From Here to Infirmary">
<text>From Here to Infirmary is the third studio album by American punk rock band Alkaline Trio. It was their first album for Vagrant and their only album with Mike Felumlee, who replaced their previous drummer, Glenn Porter. When Felumlee left the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Atom Willard filled in on tour and appeared in the music video for &quot;Private Eye&quot;, before Derek Grant became their new permanent drummer.

==Background and production==
Alkaline Trio released their second studio album &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; in March 2000, through record label Asian Man Records. Few months prior to its release, drummer Glenn Porter left the band, and was replaced by former Smoking Popes member Mike Felumlee. Two months after the album&#x27;s release, MTV reported that the band had signed to Vagrant Records. Vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba explained that while on Asian Man, they received plenty of complaints that their fans were unable to buy their music in stores. Vagrant were fans of the band, and helped them tour with Face to Face. That label&#x27;s distribution and press departments offered more than Asian Man founder Mike Park was able to provide. Park went as far to tell the band to find a bigger label as the sales and promotion was becoming a strain for him.

In the following months, Alkaline Trio promoted &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; with an appearance on the Plea for Peace Tour, and a tour with Hot Water Music. At the end of 2000, the band went to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota to record their next album. Matt Allison and the band acted as producers, assistance from Neil Weir. Allison and the band recorded 15 tracks in total, with the aim of using 12 for the final track listing. The recordings were mixed by Jerry Finn, with assistance from Laurent Bichara, at Engine Studios in Chicago, Illinois. The band picked Finn for his previous work on a Smoking Popes album a few years prior. Bassist/vocalist Dan Andriano later expressed disappointment in the album&#x27;s production, his vocal performance, and the lack of vocal harmonies; he ranked it seventh out of the eight albums they had released at that point.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; has been described as pop-punk and punk rock, with more of a focus on melody. Skiba explained that the band were moving in &quot;a more pop direction&quot;, which he said they had always wanted to do, and &quot;now have just perfected it.&quot; Andriano considered it a turning point for the band musically: &quot;&quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; definitely started to shape things up with more of a straight up rock kind of sound. I think the previous two albums are really great, but are a bit meandering. I think [&quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot;] is when Matt [Skiba] and I both realized that we wanted to tighten the screws a bit, simplify things a little and focus more on punching you in the nuts with our rock&quot;. Andriano wrote &quot;Take Lots with Alcohol&quot;, &quot;Another Innocent Girl&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Dying Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Crawl&quot;, while the rest of the songs were written by Skiba.

The opening track &quot;Private Eye&quot; details loneliness and alcohol abuse, channeling the guitarwork of Green Day and Blink-182. &quot;Mr. Chainsaw&quot; was reminiscent of &quot;Clavicle&quot;, a track from the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Goddamnit&quot; (1998). &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; is a pop punk song that utilizes a staccato guitar riff. It recalled the early works of Green Day, while following track &quot;Another Innocent Girl&quot; evokes &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got So Far to Go&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re Dead&quot; is a slower song that came across like &quot;San Francisco&quot;, another track from &quot;Goddamnit&quot;. The guitarwork in &quot;You&#x27;re Dead&quot; was compared to that heard in &quot;Fire Maple Song&quot; (1993) by Everclear. &quot;Armageddon&quot; is an uptempo punk rock track. Andriano&#x27;s vocals in the closing song &quot;Crawl&quot; earned it a comparison to the Smoking Popes.

==Release and promotion==
Two of the album&#x27;s outtakes, &quot;Hell Yes&quot; and &quot;My Standard Break from Life&quot;, were released on 7&quot; vinyl through Lookout! Records on March 13, 2001. &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; was released on April 3, 2001, by Vagrant Records. With the cover artwork, Skiba said the band attempt to give the album a &quot;metal&quot; look. They initially had different ideas for the cover, however, the band was on tour at the time, and had to relay their ideas to Vagrant. When they returned from tour, the cover wasn&#x27;t what they wanted; the artwork was a week past the deadline. Skiba, still with no idea for the final cover, told the label to use photos of the band: &quot;When I saw it I said, &#x27;make the eyes go away,&#x27; and I was like &#x27;There’s the cover.&#x27;&quot; The UK version of the album, which included &quot;My Standard Break from Life&quot; and &quot;Hell Yes&quot; as bonus tracks, was co-released by B-Unique and Vagrant.

On July 2, 2001, Felumlee took to the band&#x27;s webboard to announce his departure, stating that Skiba &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to tour with me anymore.&quot; The following day, the band&#x27;s manager posted on the webboard, explaining that Skiba had planned to replace Felumlee after their previous tour ended. Skiba and Felumlee weren&#x27;t getting along; Skiba wished to tour all-year around, however, Felumlee didn&#x27;t want to as he was looking after his family. Face to Face member Pete Parada, along with Atom Willard of Rocket from the Crypt, subsequently filled Felumlee&#x27;s position. Alkaline Trio knew Parada from previously playing shows with Face to Face; Skiba grew up admiring Rocket from the Crypt, and was influenced by Willard. Felumee formed Duvall with members of the Smoking Popes shortly afterwards. On July 8, 2001, the music video for &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; was posted on the band&#x27;s website. The video was directed by Maureen Egan, the sister of Vagrant owner Rich Egan.

Following this, Derek Grant, formerly of the Suicide Machines, joined as Felumlee&#x27;s full-time replacement. Andriano met Grant when his former band Slapstick went on tour with Suicide Machines. Grant, who had temporarily filled Josh Freese&#x27;s position in the Vandals, had heard that Alkaline Trio was looking for a permanent member. On November 15, 2001, &quot;Private Eye&quot; was released as a single. Two versions were released on CD: one with the full version and an edit of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, as well as the &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; music video, while the other featured the edit of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and live versions of &quot;Mr. Chainsaw&quot; and &quot;Cringe&quot;. On March 25, 2002, &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; was released as a single. Two versions were released on CD: one with a cover of the Berlin song &quot;Metro&quot; (1981), as well as the &quot;Private Eye&quot; music video, while the other featured live versions of &quot;She Took Him to the Lake&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Go So Far to Go&quot;.

==Touring==
Alkaline Trio played a series of shows throughout April 2001, leading to a support slot for Blink-182 the following month. They went on a cross-country tour from late May through to the end of June. The band toured the midwest until late July, where they appeared on six dates of the Vagrant America tour and at Krazy Fest 4 in Louisville, Kentucky. Around this time, the band had no copies of their album to sell due to a lawsuit Vagrant was having with their distributor. The band performed on the Plea for Peace/Take Action Tour alongside Thrice, Hot Water Music, and Cave In in August and early September. Skiba embarked on an acoustic tour for the remainder of September. Alkaline Trio was due to support Blink-182 on their European stadium tour; the trek was ultimately canceled, and the band spent time at home.

Preceded by a handful of mainland European dates in November 2001, the band then embarked on their first ever tour of the UK, which ran into December. The UK shows were supported by Crackout. After returning to the US, they played a few holiday shows with the Get Up Kids until Christmas. In January 2002, the band embarked on a second UK tour, before playing a few west coast US shows in the following month supporting the Bouncing Souls. They toured the UK a third time in March 2002, with support from Face to Face and Saves the Day. Around their appearance at Skate &amp; Surf Festival, Alkaline Trio played several shows in April. Between June and August, the band went on the 2002 Warped Tour. The band had planned to appear at the Reading Festival in the UK, but pulled out shortly before it happened. They concluded the year with two shows in their hometown of Chicago, Illinois.

==Reception==

Critical reaction to the album was mixed. Ari Wiznitzer of AllMusic called it a slump for the band and &quot;a definite low point in Alkaline Trio&#x27;s catalog&quot;, criticizing its &quot;lighter, more mainstream sound&quot; which &quot;really doesn&#x27;t complement Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano&#x27;s foul-mouthed poetry as well as their earlier abrasive sound. Adding to the disappointment is that this is the first Alkaline Trio release to have any filler, as many of the songs seem painfully tossed off (and probably were, as the band has been so prolific).&quot; Matt Hendrickson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more praising of the album&#x27;s qualities, remarking that the band &quot;deliver[s] catchy punk pop with sharp elbows and a wry sense of humor&quot; and that &quot;What saves them from the gutter are some effortless hooks and Skiba&#x27;s hysterical lyrics&quot;.

John Dark of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; remarked, &quot;There&#x27;s quite a bit that Alkaline Trio&#x27;s music is not. It&#x27;s not challenging, ambitious, or visionary. It&#x27;s not clever or self-aware. It&#x27;s not even terribly skillful. But what it is, is tasty. Pure musical junk food: fast, greasy, and crafted for a general palate.&quot; He criticized some of the music as &quot;a tad too derivative for your average rock snob&quot;, but praised the band&#x27;s lyricism and ability to turn a phrase, though noting that they would occasionally &quot;jar you back to reality with bonehead moves like spelling out the very, very thinly-disguised metaphor in one song [(&quot;Mr. Chainsaw&quot;)] for the listener&quot;. Ultimately, though, he concluded, &quot;for all its flaws, &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; remains nothing more than simply what it is: tuneful, consumable, and guiltily satisfying.&quot;

&quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; was also their first album to chart, reaching number 199 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 9 on Independent Albums. Its two singles, &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot;, both charted on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 53 and number 51, respectively. As of 2008, &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; has sold 175,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; at number 35 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; at number 28 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>Virginia () is a town in County Cavan, Ireland. Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.

==History==
===Foundation===
Virginia was founded in the early 17th century, at Aghanure (), during the Plantation of Ulster and was named Virginia after Queen Elizabeth I of England, the &quot;Virgin Queen.&quot;

The settlement was started when an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted the Crown patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of Kells and Cavan. The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined &quot;Ó Raghallaigh&quot; (O&#x27;Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient Lurgan parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of the settlement were to introduce English settlers to the area and build the town to incorporate borough status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of the Pale, so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of Lough Ramor.

Ridgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, Captain Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside Lough Oughter in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present site close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the commission&#x27;s time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.

===The Plunketts===
During November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of the 10th Baron Killeen (who was created the 1st Earl of Fingall in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic Anglo-Irish peer of Norman descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project. Complaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the commission by 1638 whereupon Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall (who had succeeded his father in the earldom in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the commission&#x27;s court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican Bishop of Kilmore, William Bedell, undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the commission&#x27;s requirement. However, events which led to the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Irish Confederate Wars enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and depopulation. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed Lord Fingall for his role in the Siege of Drogheda (1641).

What remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through hearth tax records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688–91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by Jonathan Swift during his several excursions to County Cavan.

===The Taylours===
The Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelt as Taylour), taking over. Virginia and its surrounding estate were particularly developed by Thomas Taylor (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd Bt., was created 1st Baron Headfort in 1760, and 1st Viscount Headfort in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the peerage to become The 1st Earl of Bective in 1766. It is recorded that Lord Bective&#x27;s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a cartographer who assisted Sir William Petty with the Down Survey during the previous century.

The Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, Headfort House (now a school), beside Kells in the north of County Meath. The family (who were granted the title Marquis of Headfort in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, also resulting in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20&gt;240) became fifteen shillings (180&gt;240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia&#x27;s population doubled between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive Marquesses of Headfort created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.

===Famine and emigration===

The Great Famine, caused by successive failures in the potato crop and the export of other foodstuffs outside of Ireland, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like typhus and cholera, prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.

In subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line between Kells and Oldcastle in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however, this also meant that products such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.

Perhaps the most famous Virginia emigrant was General Philip H. Sheridan (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby Killinkere, left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the American Civil War. President Lincoln stated, &quot;this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter&quot;, he eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.

The closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland&#x27;s population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.

===Modern development===
In 2007 the local development association submitted a proposal to have a new regional hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by Cavan County Council. Although supported by the community and the region&#x27;s political representatives, the bid was not progressed due to the lack of project funding. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening in 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This led to a rise in local developments, with a number of new houses and commercial businesses being built.

==Geography==

The town is situated close to Lough Ramor, one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7 km in length by 1 km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems.

==Transport==
Virginia is on the N3 route approximately 85 km northwest of Dublin, and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between Enniskillen and Dublin. Virginia is connected to Dublin by an hourly bus service from Cavan town Bus Éireann. The M3 motorway was completed in 2010 and links the North-West of Dublin to the nearby town of Kells, 20 km from Virginia.

A 12.5 km long bypass for the town of type 2 dual carriageway, intended to reduce congestion going through the town centre was planned but suspended in the late 2000s. In February 2018, the project was placed as a key project in the National Development Plan, part of &#x27;Project Ireland 2040&#x27;.

==Economy==
Sometimes regarded as a commuter town with its proximity to larger trading towns east and west, the local industry consists mainly of farming and milk processing at the local Tirlán factory (formerly Virginia Milk Products), which produces skim milk powder and cream for the Baileys Irish Cream liqueur brand. Other local manufacturers include the Fleetwood brand of paint products.

Virginia won the Tidy Towns Competition in 1964 and 1965.

==Culture==
The Ramor Theatre opened in 1999, and is funded by Cavan County Council and the Arts Council. It is the only professional performance space in the county. The theatre is a member of the NOMAD network of venues, and home to the &quot;Livin&#x27; Dred Theatre Company&quot;. The theatre also engages in community-based and amateur work through &quot;Ramor Players&quot; who present a number of shows each year.

Virginia has been home to the annual Virginia Agricultural Show for over seventy years and hosted Ireland&#x27;s only pumpkin festival in 2007. The Virginia Pumpkin Festival takes place every October bank holiday weekend at Halloween. It took a break in 2017.

==Demographics==
The town population was 3,211, as of the 2022 census. The ethnic makeup (of those stated) was 77% White Irish, 12% Other White, 1% Black/Black Irish, 3% Asian/Asian Irish and 2% Other.

==Education==
A large primary school in the town is St Mary&#x27;s NS, located next to St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. The school&#x27;s population is over 400 pupils. The primary school received an extension in 2014.

Virginia College, Cavan, formerly Virginia Vocational School, is the only secondary school in Virginia. Situated beside Lough Ramor, it is a mixed school educating approximately 740 pupils. With three extensions built over the years (most recent in 2012), the school now has three ICT suites and a language lab. The Virginia school celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2012, this was later followed by a visit to the school by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins.

<doc id="985754" wikidata="Q3618673" url="?curid=985754" title="Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act">
<text>The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d),(passed as part of ) is a U.S. law enacted in 1999 that established a cause of action for registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark or personal name. The law was designed to thwart &quot;cybersquatters&quot; who register Internet domain names containing trademarks with no intention of creating a legitimate web site, but instead plan to sell the domain name to the trademark owner or a third party. Critics of the ACPA complain about the non-global scope of the Act and its potential to restrict free speech, while others dispute these complaints. Before the ACPA was enacted, trademark owners relied heavily on the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA) to sue domain name registrants. The FTDA was enacted in 1995 in part with the intent to curb domain name abuses. The legislative history of the FTDA specifically mentions that trademark dilution in domain names was a matter of Congressional concern motivating the Act. Senator Leahy stated that &quot;it is my hope that this anti-dilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others&quot;.

For example, in &quot;Panavision Int&#x27;l L.P. v. Toeppen&quot;, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), Dennis Toeppen registered the domain name Panavision.com. Panavision, the trademark owner, learned that Toeppen had registered its trademark when it attempted to register the trademark &quot;Panavision&quot; as a domain name. Toeppen was using the domain panavision.com to display photographs of Pana, Illinois, and, when asked to cease, he offered to sell the domain name to Panavision for $13,000. After Panavision refused to buy the domain name from Toeppen, he registered its other trademark, Panaflex, as a domain name. The Court held that the FTDA could be violated without the traditional tarnishing or blurring the courts had required. Rulings like this extended the FTDA substantially.

==Overview==
Under the ACPA, a trademark owner may bring a cause of action against a domain name registrant who:
* Has a bad faith intent to profit from the mark
* Registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is
** Identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive mark
** Identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of a famous mark
** Is a trademark protected by 18 U.S.C. § 706 (marks involving the Red Cross) or 36 U.S.C. § 220506 (marks related to the &quot;Olympics&quot;)
A trademark is famous if the owner can prove that the mark &quot;is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark&#x27;s owner&quot;.

&quot;Trafficking&quot; in the context of domain names includes, but is not limited to &quot;sales, purchases, loans, pledges, licenses, exchanges of currency, and any other transfer for consideration or receipt in exchange for consideration&quot;. The ACPA also requires that the mark be distinctive or famous at the time of registration.

In determining whether the domain name registrant has a bad faith intent to profit, a court may consider many factors, including nine that are outlined in the statute:
# Registrant&#x27;s trademark or other intellectual property rights in the domain name; 
# Whether the domain name contains the registrant&#x27;s legal or common name;
# Registrant&#x27;s prior use of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or services;
# Registrant&#x27;s bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible by the domain name;
# Registrant&#x27;s intent to divert customers from the mark owner&#x27;s online location that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark;
# Registrant&#x27;s offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or a third party for financial gain, without having used the mark in a legitimate site;
# Registrant&#x27;s providing misleading false contact information when applying for registration of the domain name;
# Registrant&#x27;s registration or acquisition of multiple domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others; and
# Extent to which the mark in the domain is distinctive or famous.

The ACPA does not prevent the fair use of trademarks or any use protected by the First Amendment, which includes gripe sites. In &quot;Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince&quot;, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362 (D.N.J 2004), the court found that the first two prongs of Mayflower&#x27;s ACPA claim were easily met because (1) their registered trademark was distinctive and (2) Defendant&#x27;s &quot;mayflowervanline.com&quot; was confusingly similar to Plaintiff&#x27;s Mayflower trademark. However, when the court was examining the third prong of Plaintiff&#x27;s ACPA claim, whether Defendant registered its domain name with the bad faith intent to profit from Plaintiff, the court found Defendant had a bona fide noncommercial use of the mark, therefore, the ACPA claim failed. &quot;Defendant&#x27;s motive for registering the disputed domain names was to express his customer dissatisfaction through the medium of the Internet.&quot;

The domain name registrar or registry or other domain name authority is not liable for injunctive or monetary relief except in the case of bad faith or reckless disregard.

While § 1125 protects trademark owners, 15 U.S.C. § 1129 protects any living person from having their personal name included in a domain name, but only when the domain name is registered for profitable resale.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals caused a stir in 2013 when it held, in &quot;Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) v. GoDaddy.com&quot;, 737 F.3d 546 (9th Cir. 2013), petition for cert. denied 135 S.Ct. 55 (2014), that there is no cause of action for contributory cybersquatting, i.e. secondary liability under the ACPA. It so held notwithstanding the extensive body of case law permitting such liability where a registrar is shown to have acted outside the normal ministerial bounds of domain registration. 
It also relied on &quot;Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver&quot; and premised on the Circuit Court&#x27;s determination that the ACPA is not part of the Lanham Act and therefore not included in the rule permitting secondary liability for trademark infringement enunciated in &quot;Inwood Labs v. Ives Labs&quot;, 456 U.S. 844 (1982).

==&quot;In rem&quot; jurisdiction==
The ACPA also provides that the trademark owner can file an &quot;in rem&quot; action against the domain name in the judicial district where the domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name authority registered or assigned the domain name is located if:
*(1) the domain name violates any right of the trademark owner and
*(2) the court finds that the owner
**(a) is not able to obtain &quot;in personam&quot; jurisdiction over the person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1); or
**(b) through due diligence was not able to find a person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1) by sending a notice of the alleged violation and publishing notice of the action.

This provision is rarely used, however, because many trademark owners can achieve the same results through a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) proceeding.

==ACPA v. UDRP==
Instead of suing in federal court under the ACPA, a trademark owner can choose to pursue an administrative proceeding under ICANN&#x27;s Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). The UDRP allows a trademark owner to challenge domain name registrations in expedited administrative proceedings.

A UDRP proceeding can be faster and cheaper for trademark owners than an ACPA lawsuit. Also, UDRP outcomes tend to be pro-plaintiff because many UDRP arbitrators are trademark lawyers. However, some trademark owners prefer to bring ACPA claims because they offer more remedies than the cancellation or transfer of the domain name (the only remedies available under UDRP proceedings) and a court ruling can lead to a final resolution of the matter. Also, a suit under the ACPA may deter future cybersquatters more effectively than a UDRP proceeding.

==Domaining and the ACPA==
While the ACPA contemplated the purchase of domain names for resale to trademark owners, it did not contemplate the more modern practice of domaining. Domaining is the business of registering a domain name and parking it or placing pay-per-click ads on it. Domainers rely on type-in traffic, which is when Internet surfers type in the domain name rather than using a search engine. Domainers can make a lot of money by buying and selling domain names.

Some domainers relied on domain tasting, which involves placing pay-per-click ads on the domain for five days (or less) to determine whether the ads will make more than the annual cost of the domain. If the domain is dropped within the five-day grace period, no fee is incurred. An industry has grown up out of this business with domainers taking part in these mass registrations. This practice was largely eliminated by 2009, when ICANN began raising fees to registrars with excessive domain tasting.

In &quot;Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems&quot;, 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008), the domainer lost under the ACPA. One of the defendants, Basic Fusion, Inc. argued that they were not cybersquatters, but as an Internet registrar accredited by ICANN they could register domain names on behalf of its customers and it specialized in &quot;bulk registration&quot;. Navigation Catalyst Systems, another defendant and a customer of Basic Fusion, used their &quot;proprietary automated tool&quot; to find domain names that were not already registered and then registered them using Basic Fusion. Navigation used the five days following the registration (the &quot;advertisement grace period&quot;) to put advertisements on the websites making money from the advertisements even when they dropped the domain name registration before the five-day window closed. Plaintiff Verizon argued that defendants &quot;registered&quot; 1,392 domain names that were confusingly similar to plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks. The Court found that defendants used the confusingly similar domain names with a bad faith intent to profit.

<text>Kirill Afanasievich Meretskov (; – 30 December 1968) was a Soviet military commander. Having joined the Communist Party in 1917, he served in the Red Army from 1920. During the Winter War of 1939–1940 against Finland, he had the task of penetrating the Mannerheim Line as commander of the 7th Army. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union shortly afterwards.

The NKVD arrested Meretskov at the start of invasion of the Soviet Union. Released two months later, he returned to command the 7th Army and later the Volkhov Front during the 1941–1944 siege of Leningrad. He commanded the Karelian Front from February 1944, notably the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive of October 1944. From April 1945 he was assigned to the Far East, where he commanded a front during the Soviet invasion of Japanese Manchuria. During the war he reached the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union.

==Early life and career==
Meretskov was born at Nazaryevo in Ryazan Governorate (now in Moscow Oblast), southeast of Moscow. His parents were peasants of Russian ethnicity and lived in a rural village. He was a factory worker from 1909, first in Moscow, later near Vladimir. He joined the Bolsheviks (later the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) in August 1917, and became chief of staff of Red Guard militia that helped to organise in the town. During the Russian Civil War, he was chief of staff of a regiment, and later a division. In 1921, he graduated from the Military Academy (later the M. V. Frunze Military Academy).

From 1922, he held a number of commands as chief of staff, first in a cavalry division, later in various armies and military districts. From September 1936 to May 1937, Meretskov fought for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War under a pseudonym of &quot;General Pavlovich&quot;. In 1939, he was appointed commander of the Leningrad Military District.

==World War II==

=== Finland campaign ===
In November 1939, at the start of the Winter War, Meretskov initially ran the overall operation against the Finns. However, gross underestimations of the Finnish defenses, the size of their forces and the corresponding overestimations of the capacity of the Red Army, led to serious planning flaws. Only five rifle divisions were initially sent to assault the Mannerheim Line and piecemeal commitment of reinforcements did not achieve any effect. Meretskov failed and the command was passed on 9 December 1939 to the General Staff Supreme Command, Stavka, directly under Kliment Voroshilov (chairman), Nikolai Kuznetsov, Joseph Stalin and Boris Shaposhnikov.

Meretskov was appointed to command of the 7th Army. In January 1940, the Leningrad Military District was reformed and renamed &quot;North-Western Front.&quot; Semyon Timoshenko was chosen Army Commander to break the Mannerheim Line. This Soviet offensive was checked by the Finnish Army in the Battle of Taipale. For the next offensive, the Stavka significantly reinforced the 7th Army, deployed the 13th Army on its flank and assigned substantial heavy artillery to both armies, including B-4 howitzers and Br-5 mortars.

The next Soviet offensive began in February 1940. The heavy artillery support allowed the Soviet forces to breach the Mannerheim Line. Meretskov&#x27;s 7th Army proceeded to fight in Viborg which so far had resisted attempts of Soviet conquest. Less than two weeks after the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty, on March 21, 1940, Meretskov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941, he was Chief of the General Staff. He was dismissed on 14 January 1941, and on 24 January, Stalin spotted him at the Bolshoi and, in front of witnesses: &quot;You are courageous, capable, but without principles, spineless. You want to be nice, but you should have a plan instead and adhere to it strictly, despite the fact that someone or other is going to be resentful.&quot;

=== Operation Barbarossa ===
On June 22, 1941, when Operation Barbarossa started, Meretskov was appointed permanent adviser to Stavka. However, on June 23 he was arrested by the NKVD as a member of an alleged anti-Soviet military conspiracy. The exact reasons are unknown, and the case file was destroyed in 1955. Meretskov&#x27;s close friendship with General Dmitry Pavlov, the Soviet Commander of the Western Front who had been executed, is often considered a factor, although Pavlov, at the time, was yet to even be relieved of duty, much less arrested. Mark Solonin, in his book &quot;June the 25th: Stupidity or Aggression&quot;, proposes a theory that the actual reason might have been Meretskov&#x27;s skepticism about the need to start bombardments of Finland, and his later release was due to him turning out to have been right, although he admits that direct evidence is unlikely to be found. After being subjected to two months of torture, including being beaten with rubber rods, and having one of his ribs broken by the notorious torturer Boris Rodos in Lubyanka Prison, Meretskov relented and signed a written confession. According to Nikita Khrushchev, &quot;before his arrest, Meretskov had been a strapping young general, very strong and impressive-looking. After his release, he was a shadow of his former self. He had lost so much weight he could hardly speak.&quot; Released in September, he was taken before the police chief, Vsevolod Merkulov, whom he had known socially: he told Merkulov that their friendship was over. He was then presented to Stalin, in full army dress, and given command of the 7th Separate Army. His confession was used against other commanders arrested in May–July 1941, who were executed on the order of Lavrenty Beria near Kuybyshev on October 28, 1941, or sentenced by the Special Council of the NKVD and executed on February 23, 1942.

===Victory at Tikhvin===
Meretskov was appointed Commander of the 4th Army which fought in the defense of Leningrad against the Army Group North of von Leeb. After stopping the German Tikhvin offensive, his forces, together with the neighboring 52nd and 54th Armies, counterattacked and pushed the German forces back to their starting positions, recapturing Tikhvin on December 10, 1941. This victory was the first Soviet large scale success during the war. The battle also assisted the Battle of Moscow, as significant German forces were tied down in heavy attrition fighting in the marshes and forests between Tikhvin and Tosno and were not able to assist during the Soviet counteroffensive. Notably, the battle locked down two German panzer divisions and two motorized divisions and inflicted serious casualties to the army group overall.

During the counteroffensive of the battle, Stavka ordered Kirill Meretskov to organize a new Volkhov Front, which he commanded until February 1944 (with the exception of May and June 1942).

===Defeat at Lyuban===
In January 1942, Meretskov started a new offensive near Lyuban, aimed at lifting the siege of Leningrad and encircling a large number of German forces. The advance was very slow, however, as the German forces were well dug in, reinforced and no longer overextended. By March the two Soviet armies trying to close the encirclement were less than apart, but could advance no more. On March 15, German forces began a counteroffensive and cut off the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. Soviet forces managed to restore communications by March 30 after heavy fighting. However, when Meretskov reported this to the Stavka, he omitted that the corridor that was linking the 2nd Shock Army to the rest of the Soviet forces was no more than wide, under constant German air strikes and artillery bombardment, and therefore, had a very poor transport capacity. As a result, the Stavka did not extract the 2nd Shock Army, when it was still possible. During late April and all of May, the Volkhov front was temporarily subordinated to lieutenant general Khosin&#x27;s Leningrad Front, and Meretskov was sent as deputy high commander to the Western Front.

By May 1942, the 2nd Shock Army was experiencing supply shortages and low morale. On May 30, the German forces began a second offensive and again cut it off. After part of the encircled force broke out on June 5, the rest of the army was systematically destroyed, with 33,000 men becoming prisoners, about the same number killed, and about 10,000 men who broke out.

Immediately after the battle, Meretskov placed the blame on the captured 2nd Shock Army commander, Andrey Vlasov, whom he himself recommended to the post in April, a claim that was echoed in his post-war memoirs. Since Vlasov went on to collaborate with the German forces, there were few attempts to revisit this claim during the Soviet era. However, David Glantz points out that, irrespective of Vlasov&#x27;s decision to collaborate with German forces, his level of command in May and June 1942 was not different from most other army commanders. Furthermore, Meretskov does bear some responsibility for the defeat as the commander of the front who planned the operation and carried it out. Khosin, the commander of the Leningrad Front, was removed from command on June 8, reduced in rank and never commanded a front again, humiliatingly assigned from March 1944 to the rear line Volga Military District. Meretskov, who was arrested less than a year earlier, knew that his life may be at risk if he accepted responsibility for the disaster.

===Breaking the siege of Leningrad===
After the defeat at Lyuban, Meretskov remained in command of the Volkhov Front. Together with the new Leningrad Front&#x27;s commander, Leonid Govorov, Meretskov planned a new offensive to break the siege of the city. Volkhov and Leningrad fronts would break the blockade of the city by eliminating the German positions south of Lake Ladoga, where only separated the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This position was called &quot;the bottleneck&quot;. At the same time, German forces were planning Operation Northern Light () to capture the city and link up with Finnish forces. To achieve that, heavy reinforcements arrived from Sevastopol, which the German forces had captured in July 1942. Both sides were unaware of the other&#x27;s preparations. As a result, the Soviet Sinyavino Offensive failed and the 2nd Shock army was decimated for the second time in a year, but the German forces suffered heavy casualties and canceled Operation Northern Light. Meretskov wanted to conduct further local attacks, but this request was categorically denied by the Stavka, in addition to a formal critique he received on October 15, 1942, for his conduct of the operation.
In late November 1942, Govorov commenced planning the next operation to break the blockade of Leningrad. Meretskov soon joined the planning. In December, the plan was approved by the Stavka and received the codename Operation Iskra (Spark). Operation Iskra began on January 13, 1943, and on January 18, Soviet forces linked up, breaking the blockade. By January 22, the front line stabilized. The operation successfully opened a land corridor 8–10 km wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor that allowed far more supplies to reach the city than the &quot;Road of Life&quot;, eliminating the possibility of the capture of the city and a German-Finnish link up. On January 28, both Meretskov and Govorov were awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class.

Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts tried to follow up their success with a much more ambitious offensive operation named Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, but achieved very modest gains. Several other offensives were conducted by Meretskov in the area in 1943, slowly expanding the corridor, and making other small gains. In November 1943, Meretskov and Govorov began planning the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region.

On January 14, 1944, the Soviet offensive started. By March 1, the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts had driven Army Group North back up to on a front, liberating the southern Leningrad region and part of the Kalinin region. Meretskov and Govorov were once again awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class together.

===Karelian Front and Manchuria===
In February 1944, Meretskov was transferred to the Karelian Front. Here, he participated in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive that started in June 1944. His front liberated the city of Petrozavodsk and East Karelia. In October, Meretskov was ordered to clear the city of Petsamo, in northern Finland, of Germans and to drive the German army back into Norway. Meretskov was able to use his knowledge of Arctic warfare to launch a co-ordinated offensive called the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive that drove the Germans back from their positions. After this offensive Meretskov was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, on October 26, 1944.
Meretskov&#x27;s next major command was in Manchuria in 1945, in the Far East, where he was selected to lead the 1st Far East Front during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, under the overall command of Aleksandr Vasilevsky. According to the plan, the main force of the 1st Far East Front Army of set out from Primorsky Krai, broke through the Japanese defense line set up in the East Manchuria, and carried out assaults against the Kwantung Army in Jilin, in order to compete with Marshal Rodion Malinovsky&#x27;s Transbaikal Front. The Transbaikal Front Army cooperated and advanced towards Changchun.

Meretskov&#x27;s Far East First Front Army and Maksim Purkayev&#x27;s 2nd Far East Front jointly enclosed the Kwantung Army at Harbin in an area with a circumference of 1,500 kilometers. Before the attack on August 9, there was a heavy rain. Meretskov decisively ordered the attack without artillery fire as planned. The sudden attack worked and the Soviet army successfully seized the forward position. Within a week, the 1st Far East Front Army broke through the Kwantung Army&#x27;s 1st Front Army permanently prepared fortifications and penetrated 120 km-150 km. The Japanese headquarters completely lost command of the team and did not organize strong resistance until August 15. After August 15, the Japanese tried to organize heavy resistance in Mudanjiang, but they still could not stop the advancement of Meretskov&#x27;s 1st Far East Front Army. On the 18th, the commander of the Kwantung Army Otozō Yamada did not reply to Meretskov&#x27;s telegram requesting him to surrender. Meretskov ordered the airborne troops to be dropped at Harbin and other airports. The Kwantung Army surrendered on August 19.

In addition to military work, Meretskov also did political work. At the end of August, he went to the Chinese brigade inspection training led by Zhou Baozhong and asked his subordinates to provide the report of the North Korean battalion commander by future leader of North Korea Kim Il Sung. In September, Meretskov inspected the liberated cities of Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian, and assisted the Chinese Communist Party in restoring the party organization in the Northeast China and the establishment of the Northern Manchurian Committee of CCP. Meretskov was awarded the Order of Victory. As commander of Soviet forces in Korea, he launched the career of Kim Il Sung.

==Commander and Assistant Minister of Defense==
After the war Meretskov commanded a number of military districts until 1955 (including the Moscow Military District in 1947–49), when he was made the Assistant Minister of Defense, a post he held until 1964. In that year, he was made the Inspector-General Ministry of Defense, a largely ceremonial post.

<doc id="985758" wikidata="Q7533204" url="?curid=985758" title="Sixth form college">
<text>A sixth form college (pre-university college in Malaysia) is an educational institution, where students aged 16 to 19 study typically for advanced post-school level qualifications such as A Levels, Business and Technology Education Council level 3 (BTEC), and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations and BTEC level 2 qualifications. In many countries this type of educational institute is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase &#x27;sixth form college&#x27; as the English name for a lycée (high school).

In England and the Caribbean, education is currently compulsory until the Year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18. In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached sixth form, transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational further education college, although in some places not all these options are available. Some places only provide tertiary colleges, a &quot;combination&quot; between sixth form and further education colleges. In the independent sector including public schools, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools, and there are also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Scotland and Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of Year 11.

Students at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 1 and 2 – Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland – or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit AS examinations at the end of the first year, and A-level examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. A variety of vocational courses have also been added to the curriculum.

There are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most of these perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth-form schools which function like sixth-form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities. Unlike further education colleges, sixth-form colleges rarely accept part-time students or run evening classes, although there is one boarding sixth-form college, Peter Symonds College, which takes Falkland Islands students for sixth form.

== Brunei ==
There are a few schools in Brunei providing sixth form education. Five of them are dedicated sixth form colleges, with four located in Brunei-Muara District and one in Tutong District. Belait has yet to have its own sixth form centre and sixth form education is presently housed in Sayyidina Ali Secondary School, sharing facilities with the secondary education. There is no sixth form education in Temburong – prospective students go to sixth form colleges in Brunei-Muara where they may stay in dormitories.

Almost all sixth form schools are government schools. Five of them provide education leading up to Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level qualification. Jerudong International School is a non-government school which has sixth form education and its A Level is independent of those offered by its counterpart. Along with International School Brunei which offers the program International Baccalaureate Diploma instead of A Levels after the completion of International General Certificate of Secondary Education in their lower secondary year.

Another school, Hassanal Bolkiah Boys&#x27; Arabic Secondary School, is a government sixth form centre for students in the specialised Arabic stream. Instead of A Level subjects, students generally learn subjects pertaining to Islamic knowledge in Arabic medium. The schooling culminates in the sitting of &quot;Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Ugama Brunei (STPUB)&quot;, translatable as the Higher Certificate of Brunei Religious Education. They may then proceed to Islamic universities, locally or abroad such as Al-Azhar University.

==Caribbean==

In the English-speaking Caribbean, there are many sixth form colleges, usually attached to secondary schools. Students must usually attain a grade A-C in 1–3 in the Caribbean Examinations Council (C.X.C) CSEC examinations before proceeding onto the sixth form to sit the CAPE examinations. Students that fail these exams are not accepted into the sixth form program and can do either: courses in other further education facilities, or begin work with high school degrees.

== Malaysia ==
The sixth form in Malaysia is one of types of education prior continuing to degree level. Modeled after the United Kingdom&#x27;s sixth form, it is divided into two level, the lower sixth form and the upper sixth. It is usually taken by students at the age of 18 after completing Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. Before finishing their sixth form education, all the students are required to sit for Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia or Sijil Tinggi Agama Malaysia.

Starting 2023, the sixth form education has undergo a reform due to lack of interest among SPM leavers. Sixth form colleges has been renamed Pre-University College with the leadership has been change from Principal to Director. This is reflecting to the reality of tertiary education instead of secondary education, in which the Form 6 has been viewed as still a part of secondary school.

==United Kingdom==

===England===
The first comprehensive intake sixth form college in England was established in 1966 in Luton, Bedfordshire; Luton Sixth Form College took its first intake of students in September that year. Since then sixth form colleges have spread across England and have proved popular with students, their parents, and other groups in the community. By the start of 1976, 22 non-metropolitan counties had sixth forms, totalling 68 colleges; three of these counties had tertiary colleges. From 1991, sixth form colleges were permitted to provide some vocational courses approved by BTEC.

Until 1992, these colleges were controlled and funded by local education authorities (LEAs), but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 transferred all institutions within the sector to the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), a national agency with strategic responsibility for the operation of general further education (FE) colleges. This effectively made them legislatively indistinguishable from further education colleges. Later the FEFC&#x27;s functions were taken over by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), a reorganisation that included changes in the funding and supervision of sixth form colleges.

These colleges take responsibility for their own employment, pensions and pay arrangements with the support and advice of the Sixth Form Colleges&#x27; Association (SFCA, formerly SFCF). The SFCA is made up of representative principals from SFCs across the UK. The SFCA sets up several committees to deliver its range of support services for SFCs as well as facilitating lobbying work with the central government.
Colleges for the most part do not charge full-time daytime students; however, adult students (most of whom attend evening classes) may have to pay a fee (for examinations, tutors&#x27; time and other costs).

There are also some sixth form colleges in the independent sector, specialising in A levels for which fees are paid; these are unconnected with the SFCA.

Ofsted statistics from 2006/2007 show that sixth form colleges have a higher amount of &quot;Outstanding&quot; judgments compared to school sixth forms and further education colleges.

===Scotland===

Scotland does not, in general, have separate sixth form colleges (or, indeed, the same concept of the terminal two years of secondary education as being distinct from the other time spent there); as such, Scottish students who opt to remain in full-time education will typically remain in the same school for fifth and sixth year (the equivalent to the English lower- and upper-sixth forms), studying Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. Higher Grade qualifications can be taken in both the fifth and sixth years.

===Wales===

In Wales, sixth form education falls under the remit of the Senedd (the Welsh Parliament), and sixth form colleges are sources of further education alongside FE colleges and sixth forms integrated into secondary schools. They typically offer the Welsh Baccalaureate and Key Skills qualifications.

<text>Hofje van Guurtje de Waal is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands.

==History==
It was founded in 1616 by Guerte Jansdochter de Wael, daughter of a rich textile trader, for poor women of the Dutch Reformed faith. She died in 1632. Originally 6 small houses, it was expanded to 8 houses in 1661 when the gateway was built with the family coat of arms. This coat-of-arms is fairly unusual, featuring the Dutch Lion with its head cut off, spouting blood. It has been supposed that this shows anti-orangist political sympathies.

Until 1853 governance by female regents was handed down from mother to daughter. From that time on it was governed by the city council and slowly declined. In 1985 the complex was remodelled into 4 modern homes. Since then it is technically no longer a hofje and is managed by a Haarlem house-rental agency.

Address: Lange Annastraat 40

<doc id="985761" wikidata="Q7133646" url="?curid=985761" title="Para Handy">
<text>Para Handy is a character created by the journalist and writer Neil Munro in a series of stories published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; between 1905 and 1923 under the pen name of Hugh Foulis. He is the crafty Gaelic skipper of the &quot;Vital Spark&quot;, a Clyde puffer (steamboat) of the sort that delivered goods from Glasgow to Loch Fyne, the Hebrides, and the coast of Argyllshire and Inverness-shire in the early 20th century. 

The character&#x27;s proper name is Peter Macfarlane. Para Handy is a nickname from &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Peter () son of Sandy&quot; in Gaelic.

The stories partly focus on his pride in his ship, &quot;the smartest boat in the tred&quot; which he considers to be of a class with the Clyde steamers, but mainly tells of the &quot;high jinks&quot; the crew gets up to on their travels. He had at least one crossover with Munro&#x27;s other popular character, Erchie MacPherson of &quot;Erchie, My Droll Friend&quot;.

The other principal characters who form the crew of the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; are:
* the subtly effete engineer Dan Macphail, 
* the superstitious ship&#x27;s mate Dougie (one inconsistency in the stories is that Dougie the mate has the choice of two surnames, Cameron or Campbell), 
* the lazy deckhand is known as The Tar (real name Colin Turner) and
* the young squeezebox-playing deckhand Sunny Jim (real name Davie Green), who is cousin to The Tar and replaces him.

Also featured is Hurricane Jack (real name John Maclachlan), Para Handy&#x27;s rather outrageous adventurer friend.

Key points of friction among the crew are transporting ministers of the church (bad luck), transporting gravestones (bad luck), and the small boats carrying passengers across the Clyde in Glasgow called the Cluthas (in Para Handy&#x27;s view, the lowest of the low in Clyde shipping), and Macphail&#x27;s taste for bodice-ripping women&#x27;s fiction.

==Stories==

The stories are set in the Firth of Clyde, Loch Fyne and occasionally the Western Isles of Scotland. The stories are known for their humour and also for their evocation of a lost era in the life of these coastal communities when they depended completely on the water and not, as now, on road transport and the ferry service. This was a time when Gaelic was still spoken by some as their native language and everyone in the community was known to all, for good or ill. The church (the kirk) was much more significant in community life and a lot of humour in the stories is derived from scriptural misquotations, which contemporary readers, with their thorough knowledge of the Bible, would have understood. Reference is also made to schisms in the kirk, with the same humour, which could sting those who were overserious in defense of their splinter denomination.

The stories give an insight into the life and attitudes of the Firth of Clyde, its sea lochs and the city of Glasgow. They were written as occasional pieces in the &quot;Looker On&quot; column in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; and were designed to be recognizable to Glaswegians with Highland backgrounds and also those who were city-bred but regularly escaped the smoke to go &quot;doon the water&quot; to the Clyde resorts of Rothesay, Millport, Dunoon and Tighnabruaich. The &quot;Vital Spark&quot; also makes it to Arran and Loch Fyne, which were more adventurous destinations but also accessible to city dwellers by the railway steamers that Para Handy often envies. Some of the stories were written during the First World War and give insight into the home front of the time, casting it always in a humorous light.

==Published collections==
The stories remain perennially popular and have been regularly reprinted since their first appearance. There are various miscellaneous collections, but the main ones are the three overseen by Munro himself and several more latter-day ones.
* &quot;The Collected Stories from The Vital Spark&quot; (1906)
* &quot;In Highland Harbours with Para Handy&quot; (1911)
* &quot;Hurricane Jack of The Vital Spark&quot; (1923)

All three of these collections have been gathered together and reissued in single volumes:
* &quot;Neil Munro&#x27;s Para Handy&quot; (Seanachaidh, 1986)
* &quot;The World of Para Handy&quot; (Seanachaidh, 1990)

The &quot;Para Handy Complete Edition&quot; (Birlinn, 1992), introduced and annotated by Brian D. Osborne and Ronald Armstrong, contains 18 previously uncollected stories in addition to those above. In 2001 another story was rediscovered and has been included in all subsequent reprints.

==Film==
The Para Handy stories were the inspiration for the 1954 Ealing comedy, &quot;The Maggie&quot; (retitled &quot;High and Dry&quot; in the US), directed by Alexander Mackendrick.

==Television==
There have been three television adaptations of the Para Handy tales, all for the BBC:

The earlier series updated the stories by giving them contemporary settings. The last series is set between the world wars.

==Theatre==
* In 1995 Vital Spark Productions toured Scotland with a production of &quot;A Para Handy Wireless Show&quot; adapted by Gordon Neish and directed by Steven McNicoll.
* In 2007 the Warehouse in Lossiemouth staged a series of three plays, &quot;The New Tales of Para Handy&quot;, which are now available on DVD.
* In 2011 Eden Court &amp; Open Book presented a Scottish Tour of &quot;Para Handy – A Voyage Round the Stories of Neil Munro&quot;. The tour began in September 2011 at the Eden Court Theatre, Inverness, and went on to HMT Aberdeen, the Glasgow Theatre Royal, and the Edinburgh Festival Theatre.

==Literary sequels==
The Dunoon-based freelance author Stuart Donald, also manager of the Cowal Highland Gathering, published two volumes of new stories of the Vital Spark and her crew. He faithfully recreated the style of Munro&#x27;s originals in &quot;Para Handy Sails Again&quot; (1995) and &quot;Para Handy All at Sea&quot; (1996), which were collected together as the &quot;Complete New Tales of Para Handy&quot; (2001, republished 2011). Sadly, Donald died in September 2000 of cancer before completing the third of his planned trilogy. Before these, Donald also authored &quot;Para Handy&#x27;s Scotland: In the Wake of the Vital Spark&quot; (1994, republished 2013), a non-fiction exploration of the background of the original stories.

<doc id="985764" wikidata="Q2668583" url="?curid=985764" title="Edgeworthstown">
<text>Edgeworthstown or Mostrim () is a small town in County Longford, Ireland. The town is in the east of the county, near the border with County Westmeath. Nearby towns are Longford 12 km to the west, Mullingar 26 km to the east, Athlone 40 km to the south and Cavan 42 km to the north. The N4 and N55 roads meet in the town. The town is in the townland of Edgeworthstown and in the civil parish of Mostrim.

==Name==

The area was named Edgeworthstown in the 19th century after the Anglo-Irish Edgeworth family. An estate was built there by Richard Lovell Edgeworth. His family—which includes Honora Sneyd (his second wife), writer and intellectual Maria Edgeworth, botanist Michael Pakenham Edgeworth, economist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, and priest Henry Essex Edgeworth—lived at the estate.

The area&#x27;s original name was the Irish &quot;Meathas Troim&quot; or &quot;Meathas Truim&quot;. This was anglicized as &quot;Mastrim&quot; or &quot;Mostrim&quot; and variants. These names continued to be used by the locals. In 1935, at the behest of the local Town Tenants&#x27; Association, Longford County Council officially changed the town&#x27;s name to Mostrim. However, in 1974, a local government order reverted the name to Edgeworthstown. Today, both names are in use.

==Infrastructure==
The town is located where the N4 Dublin-Sligo/ N5 Dublin-Castlebar road crosses the N55 Cavan-Athlone road. The town also has a railway station on the Dublin–Sligo railway line. Edgeworthstown railway station opened on 8 November 1855.
Edgeworthstown expanded significantly during the first decade of the 21st century with many new housing developments and updated transport infrastructure including a bypass. The N4 National primary route formerly ran along the Main Street until the town centre was bypassed in mid-2006. The N55 route from Athlone to Cavan still passes through the town centre.

==Industry==
Industries include animal feed processing and pet food manufacturing, with Paul &amp; Vincent Limited and C &amp; D Foods Limited employing several hundred people in the area. The latter, C &amp; D Foods Limited, reopened a pet food plant in 2014 following an earlier fire.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is named Mostrim, while the minor section of the club is called Wolfe Tones GAA. The club has won three Longford Senior Football Championships, in 1974, 1985 and 1992. In Gaelic football, Mostrim won an u-21 championship 2002 and the Wolfe Tones minor team won Minor A Championships in 2002 and in 2006. In hurling, Wolfe Tones has won a record 19 Longford Senior Hurling Championship titles. Hugh Devine Park is the home pitch for both Mostrim and Wolfe Tones.

A local soccer club, Mostrim United, has played in the Longford &amp; District Schoolboy/girl League.

<doc id="985767" wikidata="Q893414" url="?curid=985767" title="Border Reivers (rugby union)">
<text>Border Reivers, originally known as &quot;Scottish Borders Rugby&quot;, and also known as &quot;The Borders&quot;, were one of four professional rugby union teams in Scotland, alongside Edinburgh, Caledonia Reds and Glasgow Warriors.

Border Reivers were active in the Scottish Inter-District Championship from 1996 to 1998 and in the Celtic League, Celtic Cup and Heineken Cup from 2002 until 2007, when, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union&#x27;s cost-cutting measures, they were disbanded. They played their home matches at Netherdale (capacity circa 6,000) in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders region.

==History==

The Border Reivers were a continuation of the amateur South of Scotland rugby union team, reshaped as a professional side in 1996.

===District sides===

Scotland had four district sides: North and Midlands, South, Glasgow District, and Edinburgh District.

The district sides capped the best amateur players from their areas&#x27; club sides to play inter-district matches and matches against touring sides. Unlike the Scottish clubs (and Ireland&#x27;s provincial sides), the Scottish district sides had no settled home and were not members of their Rugby Union. This meant when Scottish rugby embraced professionalism, it was not clear if a model based on districts or clubs would be used.

===Professional model: club or district===
It was not clear which route professionalism would go in Scotland. This created a turbulent start for professionalism in Scotland and left Scotland far behind fast-embracing Ireland in the set-up of its professional structure. The first season of the Heineken Cup in 1995–96 was run without any Scottish teams in European competition.

The SRU were concerned that the existing and long-established Scottish amateur club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that by professionalising the district sides they would be more capable of advancing Scottish Rugby.

The four amateur district teams – Glasgow, Edinburgh, South of Scotland, and North and Midlands – were to become the professional sides Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby, Border Reivers, and the Caledonia Reds, respectively.

===Formation of Border Reivers===

The Border Reivers were created in 1996 to compete in the Heineken Cup, because the Scottish Rugby Union did not think that Scottish club sides would be able to compete against the best teams from France and England.

Border Reivers and the other three Scottish districts competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship to determine their European qualifying; the leagues positions determining whether they entered the Heineken Cup or the Challenge Cup.

===Merger with Edinburgh Rugby===

Then financial difficulties – the SRU&#x27;s high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield – called for retrenchment. After two seasons, financial difficulties forced the Union to merge the four teams into two. The Border Reivers side merged with Edinburgh Rugby to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers, causing outrage with many Border rugby fans, as effectively the Border side was disbanded.

===Resurrection===
The establishment and early success of a Celtic League caused the SRU to rethink its professional district structure. The Border Reivers side was resurrected in 2002 as The Borders and joined the second season of the Celtic League.

Since their return as a team in 2002, the Borders failed to challenge for the Celtic League title; however, they performed well during the 2005–06, finishing mid-table.

===Disbandment again===

On 27 March 2007, Scottish Rugby Union announced the Reivers were to disband at the end of the season as a cost-cutting exercise. Many fans and sections of the Scottish media have claimed that the Reivers suffered due to SRU&#x27;s determination, despite poor crowds and results, to make rugby a success in Glasgow. At the end of the 2006–07 season, several Borders players transferred to Glasgow Warriors. The success Glasgow later achieved with sell out crowds and a Pro 12 title win suggests this was a wise strategy.

===Potential revival===

Following the decision by the SRU to disband the Borders Reivers, the Border Reivers Action Group was formed to fight against the disbandment.

However, in April 2007, the Borders Rugby Action Group conceded defeat as the SRU insisted there would be no finance available from the governing body. The action group pledged an attempt to resurrect the team in 2008; however, no such attempt was made.

On 19 December 2011, former Scottish internationalist Keith Robertson gave an interview to &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper. Robertson claimed that he was in contact with &quot;people in the Borders who are interested in getting involved in funding a professional team&quot;. However the interested parties were said to be unwilling to afford any direct shareholding to the SRU. Robertson went on to claim that if the project came to fruition, the team would feature many &quot;Borderers&quot; – an attribute he felt the defunct Border Reivers had lacked.

<text>The Bruiningshofje is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands.

==History==
It was founded in 1610 by Jan Bruininck Gerritz (it i s assumed), and is one of four hofjes owned by the Mennonite church of Haarlem. The others are the Wijnbergshofje in the Barrevoetestraat, the Zuiderhofje on the Zuiderstraat, and the Blokshofje on the Klein Heiligland (sold in 1970). The founder was from Sneek, and he probably founded the hofje with his daughters in mind, since he had several of them and family members were given first rights to a place in the hofje. The earliest documents surviving date from after this original donor died. A document survives from 1647 in which a sum of 150 &quot;Carolus guldens&quot; is recorded for adding a new house and garden, received from &quot;Lysbeth van Blenckvliet&quot;. This early donor was also the founder of the Zuiderhofje, and explains why the garden is managed by the Zuiderhofje gardener.

==Living conditions==
We know something about the living conditions in this hofje from the list of women who came to live there, compared to the list of deaths, though only the more prominent names are recorded. These women tended to live longer than the general population. The list of donations in the form of &quot;s&quot;. is also quite long; many opted to give a small amount (5 cents) to the women on their death-day. In 1800 this had grown to free rent for all six women, and during the year the following goods for the hofje: 20 5-cent pieces each week, 20 tons turf, two 20-pound barrels of butter, two sacks of potatoes, and a half-sack of salt.

The hofje originally had rooms for six women with a common privy in the garden. It wasn&#x27;t renovated for running water or gas heat until 1936, when a redesign was executed, resulting in five homes. It was again renovated in 1978, and the number of houses was reduced again from five to four. The hofje was once one of the wealthiest of Haarlem, and is still quite well off today. The rent is free for the four women living there; they only need to pay service costs.

<text>Harvey John Smith (born 29 December 1938) is a retired British show jumping champion. He stood out from the ranks of showjumpers because of his broad accent and blunt manner. His career was often controversial: in 1971 he was disciplined (overturned on appeal) after he gave a &quot;V sign&quot; to the judges following a near-perfect round which won him the British Show Jumping Derby for the second year in succession; this act also earned him a &#x27;tongue-in-cheek&#x27; part in an advertisement for Victory V sweets with the slogan &#x27;They&#x27;ve got a kick like a mule!&#x27; The expression &quot;Doing a Harvey Smith&quot; entered the English language for giving a V sign.

== Early life ==

Harvey John Smith was born on 29 December 1938 in Gilstead, England, to Walter and Ethel Smith who wanted him to &quot;continue the family tradition and work in the construction industry with his older brother John&quot;. He rode his first pony at seven, and competed in his first show in 1947 at 8 years old on a local farmer&#x27;s milk pony. He wasn&#x27;t fond of school and preferred to spend his time outdoors with animals, and bought his first jumping horse &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot; in 1954.

== Show jumping career ==

Smith competed in two Olympics—riding &quot;Summertime&quot; to 4th place for Great Britain in the Team jumping competition at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, he rode &quot;Madison Time&quot; to 11th place in the Individual jumping and 8th place for Great Britain in the Team jumping.

Smith won the John Player Trophy, the grand prix of Great Britain, seven times.

In 1989 Smith was honoured for being the first man to have jumped in 100 Volvo World Cup Qualifying Rounds.

He retired from show jumping competition in 1990.

<text>The Brouwershofje is a hofje on the Tuchthuisstraat in Haarlem, Netherlands.

==History==
The Hofje was founded by the Haarlem Guild of Beer brewers, one of the most powerful guilds in Haarlem. It was initially named the &quot;St. Maartenshofje&quot; after the patron saint of the brewers. It was intended as a charitable home for 22 poor people (&quot;rechte arme huyszitten&quot;) who worked in the brewing industry. The Brewer&#x27;s guild used the money for the hofje from a donation it received in 1472 by Jacob Huyge Roepersz and his sister Katharina, who donated a series of small houses (kameren) in the Gasthuisstraat (the Tuchthuisstraat used to be a northern extension of the Gasthuisstraat) for housing, and some land in Akersloot for rents. The donation made the requirement that the houses needed to be rebuilt if they were damaged by fire or any other reason. 

The Roeper family was a brewers family, so the hofje was run by the 4 Brewer&#x27;s guild &quot;vinders&quot; or aldermen, and the deacon, who became the 5 hofje regents. Though the foundation did not stipulate &quot;women only&quot;, the hofje was used for brewer&#x27;s maids too old or sick to work. In 1553 it was again enriched with a donation by Mr. Dierick Diericsen Bram, who stipulated in his will that the money from his annuity would go to the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis if money was paid out from his annuity for any other reason than for repairs and renovations on the hofje houses. The finances of this hofje were never very great, and in 1562 when the malt-makers (moutmakers) guild was merged with the brewers guild, the malt-makers were required to make a yearly donation to the &quot;St. Maartenshofje&quot;.

The hofje burnt down in the great fire of 1576, but there was only enough money from the rents to rebuild it years later in 1586, with a reduction in the number of houses to 8. The names of the brewers who attended to the rebuilding were listed in Samuel Ampzing&#x27;s History of Haarlem and these were Jan Aelbertsz Ban, Matthijs Florisz, Matthijs Aelbertsz Ban, Barent Wiggertsz Kousebant, Klaes Aelbertsz Vooght, Frans Adriaensz, Kies &amp; Gerbrant Kornelisz Burst. The original rules of the hofje had burned also, so a new set of rules was made up in 1597. Their dead were buried in two graves located the chapel of the &quot;H. Geesthuis&quot; (where now the Hofje van Oorschot is) until the 18th century, when they bought three graves in the St. Bavochurch.

===&quot;Rechts houden&quot;===
The renovation in 1586 included building a blind wall on the street side with a doorway leading to the garden and the houses. The iron anchors on the brick wall are numbered 1586 on the north side of the door. This blind wall was to protect the hofje inhabitants from the strangers on the other side of the street; the inhabitants of the Tuchthuis. This was the Haarlem house of corrections. At the North end of the street a house still has a plaque which says &quot;Rechts houden&quot;, or &quot;keep to the right&quot;, which also means &quot;stay straight&quot; in the sense of conducting oneself with the proper behavior. Coming from the North, the hofje is on the right and the Tuchthuis was on the left. The old Tuchthuis is now a modern apartment building. The old gate to the Tuchthuis, which also had a blind wall on the street side, is now part of the Frans Hals Museum. In 1930 the hofje was renovated again in order to install modern plumbing and electricity, and at that time eight windows were cut in the blind wall to allow more light.

==Hofje today==
When the Brewers guild was disbanded (along with the other Haarlem guilds) at the start of the French occupation in 1795, the hofje was run by a city-appointed committee, and since 1811 after the departure of the French, the hofje has been run by the Haarlem city council. Monumentenzorg takes care of the houses, and the Plantsoenendienst takes care of the garden.

<doc id="985780" wikidata="Q2268246" url="?curid=985780" title="Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen">
<text>The Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands. It was founded in 1650 by the testament of Willem van Heythuysen (sometimes spelled Heijthuijsen) on the site of his summer residence outside the city walls of Haarlem on land that was considered Heemstede property until it was annexed in 1927. It is one of the few hofjes of Haarlem to be built outside the city walls. It has a &#x27;T&#x27; shape and has a small open courtyard and a garden still intact.

==Biography==
Willem Heythuijsen was a cloth merchant born in Weert, a small city in Dutch Limburg. Frans Hals painted him several times, and one of these portraits hung in this hofje for centuries. In 1636 Willem van Heythuijsen had his will and testament drawn up with the plans for this hofje in the event that he and his sister would die without issue. All of the information we have today about Willem van Heythuijsen is from this will and the acts drawn up by his executors Tieleman Roosterman and Marten van Sittart. Roosterman was the first regent of the hofje and also had his portrait painted by Frans Hals. 

After his sister Geertruyd van Heyhuysen died, his double house on the Oude gracht were sold, as was his summer home on the Spaarne. The summer home &quot;Middelhout&quot; was sold to Hendrik van Vladeracken, brother-in-law to Rosterman. Their daughter Susanna became a regent of the hofje and lived to be 90. Thanks to her legacy, the hofje underwent repairs and a painting was made to honor her that is now in the possession of the Frans Hals Museum. Today Middelhout is called Spaar en Hout and is an old age home.

The proceeds of the van Heythuijsen estate were used to convert the orchard and the gardener&#x27;s houses of Middelhout into a hofje with room for twelve pensioners, and enough money was left over to make donations to the &quot;Oudemannenhuis&quot; (currently the location of the Frans Hals Museum), the &quot;Diaconie&quot; (currently the location of the Police station), and to the city of Weert for founding a hofje there as well. To provide income for the hofje, more land was purchased just north of this hofje outside the city walls in an area called &quot;Rozenprieel&quot;, which generated income from rents. 

Unlike many other hofjes, this hofje accommodated both male and female inhabitants, until it switched to only female inhabitants in the 18th century. The hofje was built on the border with Heemstede, and the regent&#x27;s room was south of the rest of the complex on Heemstede land. For centuries a stone border marker was situated in front of the entrance. In 1927 Haarlem annexed a large portion of Heemstede and the marker was removed. It is now in the garden of the Frans Hals Museum.

Address: Kleine Houtweg 135

<doc id="985785" wikidata="Q1196075" url="?curid=985785" title="Our Lady of Sorrows">
<text>Our Lady of Sorrows (), Our Lady of Dolours, the Sorrowful Mother or Mother of Sorrows (), and Our Lady of Piety, Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows or Our Lady of the Seven Dolours are names by which Mary, mother of Jesus, is referred to in relation to sorrows in life. As &quot;&quot;, it is also a key subject for Marian art in the Catholic Church.

The Seven Sorrows of Mary are a popular religious theme and a Catholic devotion. In common imagery, the Virgin Mary is portrayed sorrowful and in tears, with one or seven swords piercing her heart, iconography based on the prophecy of Simeon in Luke 2:34–35. Pious practices in reference to this title include the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows, , the , and the &quot;Via Matris&quot;.

The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows is liturgically celebrated every 15 September, while a feast, the Friday of Sorrows, is observed in some Catholic countries.

== Seven Sorrows of Mary ==
The Seven Sorrows (or &quot;&quot;) are events in the life of Mary that are a popular devotion and are frequently depicted in art.

These Seven Sorrows should not be confused with the five Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary.

Traditionally, the Seven Sorrows are (with some variations, using nearby episodes):
# The Prophecy of Simeon in Luke 2, or the Circumcision of Jesus;
# The Flight into Egypt in Matthew 2;
# The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple of Jerusalem, also in Luke 2;
# Mary meeting Jesus on the Via Dolorosa, the Fourth station of the Cross which can be found in Luke 23:27 (See John 19:25 for context); 
# The Crucifixion of Jesus on Mount Calvary in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, and especially John 19;
# Jesus&#x27;s Descent from the Cross in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, and John 19;
# The Burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathea also in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, and John 19.

== Devotions to the Seven Sorrows ==
===Western Christianity===
The Catholic devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows started to develop around the end of the 11th century, particularly in areas around the Mediterranean.

In 1233, seven youths in Tuscany founded the Servite Order (also known as the &quot;Servite Friars&quot;, or the &quot;Order of the Servants of Mary&quot;). Later in 1239, they took up the sorrows of Mary, standing under the Cross, as the principal devotion of their order. That year, according to Alphonsus Liguori in his book &quot;The Glories of Mary,&quot; Mary appeared to the seven founders presenting them the black &quot;garment of mourning&quot; that they would wear, telling them that they should often meditate upon her dolors. This Order greatly contributed to the spread of the devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows. The Servites developed the three most common devotions to Our Lady&#x27;s Sorrows, namely the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows, the Black Scapular of the Seven Dolours of Mary and the Novena to Our Sorrowful Mother. The rosary consists of a chaplet of seven septets of beads, upon which is said an &quot;Ave&quot;, (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;), separated by one bead, on which is prayed a Pater Noster (the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, or &quot;Our Father).&quot; Meditations for each dolor were composed by Pope Pius VII in 1818. The Black Scapular is a symbol of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows, which is associated with the Servite Order. Most devotional scapulars have requirements regarding ornamentation or design. The devotion of the Black Scapular requires only that it be made of black woollen cloth. 

Over the centuries several other devotions, and even orders, arose around meditation on Mary&#x27;s Sorrows in particular.

Related to this devotion is the Stabat Mater, a hymn composed in honor of the sufferings of Mary during the Crucifixion, generally attributed to Jacopone da Todi (1230-1306).

Alphonsus Liguori dedicated a whole chapter of his book &quot;The Glories of Mary&quot; (1750) to the seven dolors of Mary, and wrote reflections on each of the seven dolors. In this chapter, he also relates four promises made by Jesus to Mary for those who were devoted to her seven sorrows. These promises were reportedly revealed to Elizabeth of Hungary (1207-1231).

# &quot;That those who invoke the divine mother by her sorrows, before death will merit to obtain true repentance of all their sins.&quot;
# &quot;That He will protect such in their tribulations, especially at the hour of death.&quot;
# &quot;That He will impress upon them the memory of his passion, and that they shall have their reward for it in heaven.&quot;
# &quot;That He will commit such devout servants to the hands of Mary, that she may dispose of them according to her pleasure, and obtain for them all the graces she desires.&quot;

From the National Shrine of Saint Peregrine spread the Sorrowful Mother Novena, the core of which is the Via Matris. The core of the prayers in the novena is the &quot;Via Matris&quot;.

===Eastern Christianity===
On February 2, the same day as the Great Feast of the Meeting of the Lord, Orthodox Christians and Eastern Catholics commemorate a wonder-working icon of the Theotokos (Mother of God) known as &quot;the Softening of Evil Hearts&quot; or &quot;Simeon&#x27;s Prophecy&quot;.

It depicts Mary at the moment that Simeon the Righteous says, &quot;Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also...&quot; (). She stands with her hands upraised in prayer, and seven swords pierce her heart, indicative of the seven sorrows. This is one of the few Orthodox icons of the Theotokos which do not depict the infant Jesus. The refrain &quot;Rejoice, much-sorrowing Mother of God, turn our sorrows into joy and soften the hearts of evil men!&quot; is also used.

In the Western Rite Vicariate of the Antiochian Orthodox Church, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows is celebrated on the Friday before Palm Sunday and as a separate feast on September 15.

== Five Lances of the Immaculate Heart ==

The Five Lances (Latin: &quot;Quinque Lanceis&quot;) of the Immaculate Heart of Mary refer to events, that according to St. Bridget, were revealed by the Blessed Virgin Mary as having pierced her heart, while she was standing by the Cross. These are not the same as the five sorrowful mysteries of the Rosary. 

According to St. Bridget, Mary stated that the Five Lances were:
# The exposition of the nakedness of her Son Jesus on the Cross, after being stripped of his garments (Tenth Station of the Cross); 
# The Mocking of Jesus; 
# The placement of the Crown of Thorns on her Jesus&#x27;s head and his bleeding afterwards;
# Jesus&#x27;s crying out &quot;Eli Eli lama sabachthani,&quot; understood by her as if he was saying &quot;Father, there is none to have mercy on me, but thou.&quot;;
# The death of Jesus on the Cross.

== Liturgical feast ==
===Our Lady of Compassion===
The Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows grew in popularity in the 12th century, although under various titles. Some writings would place its roots in the eleventh century, especially among the Benedictine monks.

The feast of the Our Lady of Sorrows was originated by a provincial synod of Cologne in 1423. It was designated for the Friday after the third Sunday after Easter and had the title: &quot;Commemoratio angustiae et doloris B. Mariae V&quot;. Its object was the sorrow of Mary during the Crucifixion and Death of Christ. Before the sixteenth century this feast was limited to the dioceses of North Germany, Scandinavia, and Scotland.

According to Fr. William Saunders, &quot;in 1482, the feast was officially placed in the Roman Missal under the title of &quot;Our Lady of Compassion&quot;, highlighting the great love our Blessed Mother displayed in suffering with her Son. The word compassion derives from the Latin roots &quot;cum&quot; and &quot;patior&quot; which means &quot;to suffer with&quot;.

After 1600 it became popular in France and was set for the Friday before Palm Sunday. By a Decree of 22 April 1727, Pope Benedict XIII extended it to the entire Latin Church, under the title &quot;Septem dolorum B.M.V.&quot;. In 1954, it still held the rank of major double (slightly lower than the rank of the September feast) in the General Roman Calendar. Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 Code of Rubrics reduced it to the level of a commemoration.

===The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary===

In 1668, a separate feast of the Seven Sorrows of Mary, celebrated on the third Sunday in September, was granted to the Servites. Pope Innocent XII renamed it the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows. Pope Pius VII introduced it into the General Roman Calendar in 1814. In 1913, Pope Pius X, in view of his reform giving precedence to Sundays over ordinary feasts, moved this feast to September 15, the day after the Feast of the Cross. It is still observed on that date.

Since there were thus two feasts with the same title, on each of which the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; sequence was recited, the Passion Week celebration was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969 as a duplicate of the September feast. Each of the two celebrations had been called a feast of &quot;The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; (Latin: &quot;Septem Dolorum Beatae Mariae Virginis&quot;). Recitation of the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; was made optional.

On the second Sunday of September, the congregation of Maria SS. Addolorata in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, hold an annual procession with a statue of Our Lady of Sorrows. The tradition started in the 1940s with Italian immigrants from Mola di Bari celebrating the Feast of their hometown patroness, Our Lady of Sorrows.

==Iconography==
Our Lady of Sorrows, depicted as &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot; (Mother of Sorrows) has been the subject of some key works of Catholic Marian art. &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot; is one of the three common artistic representations of a sorrowful Virgin Mary, the other two being Stabat Mater and the Pietà.

In this iconography, Our Lady of Seven Sorrows is at times simply represented in a sad and anguished mode by herself, her expression being that of tears and sadness. In other representations the Virgin Mary is depicted with seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. The type dates from the latter part of the 15th century.

<text>Vacuum extraction (VE), also known as ventouse, is a method to assist delivery of a baby using a vacuum device. It is used in the second stage of labor if it has not progressed adequately. It may be an alternative to a forceps delivery and caesarean section. It cannot be used when the baby is in the breech position or for premature births. The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother or the child. The term &quot;ventouse&quot; comes from the French word for &quot;suction cup&quot;.

==Medical uses==

There are several indications to use a vacuum extraction to aid delivery:
* Maternal exhaustion
* Prolonged second stage of labor
* Foetal distress in the second stage of labor, generally indicated by changes in the foetal heart-rate (usually measured on a CTG)
* Maternal illness where prolonged &quot;bearing down&quot; or pushing efforts would be risky (e.g. cardiac conditions, blood pressure, aneurysm, glaucoma). If these conditions are known about before the birth, or are severe, then an elective caesarean section may be performed.

==Technique==

The woman is placed in the lithotomy position and assists throughout the process by pushing. A suction cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the flexion point, about 3 cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) fontanelle, is critical to the success of a vacuum extraction. Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction. When the baby&#x27;s head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the birthing attendant and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby.

For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. Preferably the operator of the vacuum extractor needs to be experienced in order to safely perform the procedure. The baby should not be preterm, previously exposed to scalp sampling or failed forceps delivery. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or caesarean section.

==History==
In 1849 the Edinburgh professor of obstetrics James Young Simpson, subsequently known for pioneering the use of chloroform in childbirth, designed the Air Tractor which consisted of a metal syringe attached to a soft rubber cup. This was the earliest known vacuum extractor to assist childbirth but it did not become popular. Swedish professor Tage Malmstrom developed the ventouse, or Malmstrom extractor in the 1950s. Originally made with a metal cap, new materials such as plastics and siliconised rubber have improved the design so that it is now used more than forceps.

Vacuum delivery as a percentage of vaginal births vary depending on location. In the USA they comprise about 10% to 15% of vaginal births while in Italy 4.8% of vaginal births were delivered via vacuum in 2013.

==Comparisons to other forms of assisted delivery==

===Positive aspects===
* An episiotomy may not be required.
* The mother still takes an active role in the birth.
* No special anesthesia is required.
* There is less potential for maternal trauma compared to forceps and caesarean section.

===Negative aspects===
* The baby will be left with a temporary lump on its head, known as a chignon.
* There is a possibility of cephalohematoma formation, or subgaleal hemorrhage which can be life-threatening.
* There is a higher risk of failure to deliver the baby than with forceps, and an increased likelihood of perineal trauma.

<text>The Norton Sound (Inupiaq: &quot;Imaqpak&quot;) is an inlet of the Bering Sea on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska, south of the Seward Peninsula. It is about 240 km (150 mi) long and 200 km (125 mi) wide. The Yukon River delta forms a portion of the south shore and water from the Yukon influences this body of water. It is ice-free from June to October.

Norton Sound was explored by Captain James Cook in September 1778. He named the body of water after Sir Fletcher Norton, then Speaker of the British House of Commons.

The Norton Sound area has been home to Yup&#x27;ik and Iñupiat for many centuries. It is the boundary between the two peoples; the Inupiat live to the north and the Yup&#x27;ik to the south. The town of Nome is along the northern edge of Norton Sound. The villages of Elim, Golovin, Stebbins, White Mountain, Koyuk, Shaktoolik, St. Michael, and Unalakleet are on the shores or waterways flowing into Norton Sound. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race runs through coastal villages between Unalakleet and Nome.

The seaplane tender was named after the inlet. The Eliot Staples Bering Sea Ice Golf Classic occurs at the sound in mid-March. Nome National Forest is located just off the coast of Nome.

<text>Anglo-Egyptian Sudan ( &quot;&quot;) was a condominium of the United Kingdom and Egypt between 1899 and 1956, corresponding mostly to the territory of present-day South Sudan and Sudan. Legally, sovereignty and administration were shared between both Egypt and the United Kingdom, but in practice the structure of the condominium ensured effective British control over Sudan, with Egypt having limited local power and influence. In the meantime, Egypt itself fell under increasing British influence. Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, Egypt pushed for an end to the condominium, and the independence of Sudan. By agreement between Egypt and the United Kingdom in 1953, Sudan was granted independence as the Republic of the Sudan on 1 January 1956. In 2011, the south of Sudan itself became independent as the Republic of South Sudan.
Muhammad Ali took control of Egypt in 1805, and while he was nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt under his rule acted as a virtually independent state. Seeking to supplant and ultimately replace the Ottoman Empire as the dominant regional power, Muhammad Ali declared himself Khedive, and expanded Egypt&#x27;s borders both southwards into Sudan, and eastwards into the Levant and Arabia, the latter at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Territory in Sudan was annexed by Egypt, and governed as an integral part of the country, with Sudanese granted Egyptian citizenship. Ultimately, the intervention of the Great Powers in support of the Ottoman Empire forced Egypt to return all Levantine and Arabian territory to the Ottomans upon Muhammad Ali&#x27;s death. However, there was no such impediment to Egypt&#x27;s southward expansion.

During the reign of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s grandson, Isma&#x27;il Pasha, Egypt consolidated and expanded its control of the Sudan as far south as the Great Lakes region, whilst simultaneously acquiring territory in modern-day Chad, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia. Additionally, the hitherto unsanctioned use of the title Khedive was formally approved by the Ottoman Sultan. Egypt was at the height of its power, with Isma&#x27;il seeking the establishment of a contiguous African empire that could be a bulwark against European expansion in Africa.

Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s grand ambitions were, however, cut short by Egypt&#x27;s ruinous defeat in the Ethiopian-Egyptian War, which exacerbated pre-existing financial problems in the country caused by his cripplingly expensive programmes of rapid modernisation. This led ultimately to the Great Powers deposing Isma&#x27;il in 1879 in favour of his son, Tewfik Pasha. Egypt thereafter withdrew from all territories outside of Sudan, and Egypt proper.

Discontent with the rule of Tewfik sparked two revolts in 1881, the Mahdist Revolt in Sudan, and the Orabi Revolt in Egypt proper. Whilst the military intervention of the United Kingdom in 1882 crushed the Orabi Revolt, and restored Tewfik&#x27;s nominal authority in Egypt proper, the Mahdist Revolt continued to expand, leaving Sudan under the effective rule of the Mahdist rebels.

The British military presence in Egypt transformed the country into a virtual protectorate of the United Kingdom. Though it remained de jure a self-governing vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, true power now rested with the United Kingdom&#x27;s representative in Cairo. In the following decade, the United Kingdom reformed and remodelled the Egyptian military on British lines, and British and Egyptian forces gradually defeated the Mahdist rebels, and restored the nominal authority of the Egyptian Khedive in Sudan. However, as in Egypt proper, this authority was compromised by the reality of effective British control.

In 1899, the United Kingdom forced Abbas II, Tewfik&#x27;s successor as Khedive, to transform Sudan from an integral part of Egypt into a condominium in which sovereignty would be shared between Egypt and the United Kingdom. Once established, the condominium witnessed ever-decreasing Egyptian control, and would for most of its existence be governed in practice by the United Kingdom through the Governor-General in Khartoum. For the remainder of his reign, this would be one of the flashpoints between the nationalist Khedive Abbas II and the United Kingdom, with Abbas seeking to arrest and reverse the process of increasing British control in Egypt and Sudan.

Following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry in to the First World War as a member of the Central Powers in 1914, the United Kingdom deposed the anti-British Abbas II in favour of his pro-British uncle, Hussein Kamel. The legal aspect of the nominal Ottoman sovereignty was terminated, and the Sultanate of Egypt, destroyed by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, was re-established with Hussein Kamal as Sultan. Despite the restoration of the nominal sultanate, British power in Egypt and Sudan was undiminished, as the United Kingdom declared Egypt to be a formal protectorate of the United Kingdom. Whilst Egypt was not annexed to the British Empire, with the British King never becoming sovereign of Egypt, Egypt&#x27;s status as a protectorate precluded any actual independence for the sultanate. For all intents and purposes, the Sultanate of Egypt was as much controlled by the United Kingdom as the Khedivate of Egypt had been. Rising nationalist anger at British control led to the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, prompting the United Kingdom to recognise Egyptian independence in 1922 as the Kingdom of Egypt. Egyptian nationalists, and Sudanese favouring union with Egypt, demanded that Sudan be included within the bounds of the kingdom, with the term &quot;Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan&quot; entering the nationalist vernacular. However, in the terms of the legal instrument by which the United Kingdom recognised Egyptian independence, it specifically reserved the issue of the governance of Sudan as a question to be resolved in the future. Defying Egyptian and Sudanese demands, the United Kingdom gradually assumed more control of the condominium, edging out Egypt almost completely by 1924.

In the decades that followed, Egyptian and Sudanese discontent and anger at continued British rule in Sudan increased. On 16 October 1951, the Egyptian government abrogated the agreements underpinning the condominium, and declared that Egypt and Sudan were legally united as the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan, with King Farouk as the King of Egypt and the Sudan. This was superseded by the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 eight months later, which overthrew King Farouk. The new revolutionary government under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser made Sudanese independence a priority. Naguib himself was half-Sudanese, and had been born and raised in Khartoum. Under continued pressure, the United Kingdom conceded to Egypt&#x27;s demands in 1953, with the governments of both Egypt and the United Kingdom agreeing to terminate the condominium, and grant Sudan independence in 1956. On 1 January 1956, Egyptian and British sovereignty over Sudan duly ended, and Sudan became independent.

== Background ==

=== Union with Egypt ===

In 1820, the army of Egyptian wāli Muhammad Ali Pasha, commanded by his son Ismail Pasha, gained control of Sudan. The region had longstanding linguistic, cultural, religious, and economic ties to Egypt, and had been partially under the same government at intermittent periods since the times of the pharaohs. Muhammad Ali was aggressively pursuing a policy of expanding his power with a view to possibly supplanting the Ottoman Empire (to which he technically owed fealty), and saw Sudan as a valuable addition to his Egyptian dominion. During his reign and that of his successors, Egypt and Sudan came to be administered as one political entity, with all ruling members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty seeking to preserve and extend the &quot;unity of the Nile Valley&quot;. This policy was expanded and intensified most notably by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s grandson, Ismail Pasha, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan, and South Sudan was conquered.

=== British involvement ===
With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt and Sudan&#x27;s economic and strategic importance increased enormously, attracting the imperial attentions of the Great Powers, particularly the United Kingdom. Ten years later in 1879, the immense foreign debt of Ismail Pasha&#x27;s government served as the pretext for the Great Powers to force his abdication and replacement by his son Tewfik Pasha. The manner of Tewfik&#x27;s ascension at the hands of foreign powers greatly angered Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists who resented the ever-increasing influence of European governments and merchants in the affairs of the country. The situation was compounded by Tewfik&#x27;s perceived corruption and mismanagement, ultimately culminating in the Orabi Revolt led by the nationalist head of the army, Ahmed Orabi. With the survival of his throne in dire jeopardy, Tewfik appealed for British assistance. In 1882, at Tewfik&#x27;s invitation, the British bombarded Alexandria, Egypt&#x27;s and Sudan&#x27;s primary seaport, and subsequently invaded the country. British forces overthrew the Orabi government in Cairo, and proceeded to occupy the rest of Egypt and Sudan in 1882. Though officially the authority of Tewfik had been restored, in reality the British largely took control of Egyptian and Sudanese affairs.

=== Mahdist revolt ===

Tewfik&#x27;s acquiescence to British occupation as the price for securing the monarchy was deeply detested by many throughout Egypt and Sudan. With the bulk of British forces stationed in northern Egypt, protecting Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez Canal, opposition to Tewfik and his European protectors was stymied in Egypt. In contrast, the British military presence in Sudan was comparatively limited, and eventually revolt broke out. The rebellion in Sudan, led by the Sudanese religious leader Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi (Guided One), was both political and religious. Abdalla wished not only to expel the British, but to overthrow the monarchy, viewed as secular and Western-leaning, and replace it with what he viewed as a pure Islamic government. Whilst primarily a Sudanese figure, Abdalla even attracted the support of some Egyptian nationalists, and caught Tewfik and the British off-guard. The revolt culminated in the fall of Khartoum, and the death of the British General Charles George Gordon (Gordon of Khartoum) in 1885. Tewfik&#x27;s Egyptian forces and those of the United Kingdom were forced to withdraw from almost all of Sudan, with Ahmad subsequently establishing a theocratic state.

Ahmad&#x27;s religious government imposed traditional Islamic laws upon Sudan, and stressed the need to continue the armed struggle until the British had been completely expelled from the country, and all of Egypt and Sudan had been Incorporated under his Mahdiya. Though he died six months after the fall of Khartoum, Ahmad&#x27;s call was fully echoed by his successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, who invaded Ethiopia in 1887, and penetrated as far as Gondar, and the remainder of northern Sudan and Egypt in 1889. This invasion was halted by Tewfik&#x27;s forces, and was followed later by withdrawal from Ethiopia. Abdullahi wrecked virtually all of the previous Egyptian, and Funj administrative systems, and gravely weakened Sudanese tribal unities. From 1885 to 1898, the population of Sudan collapsed from eight to three million due to war, famine, disease and persecution.

== History ==

After a series of Mahdist defeats, Tewfik&#x27;s son and successor, Abbas II, and the British decided to re-establish control over Sudan. Leading a joint Egyptian-British force, Kitchener led military campaigns from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener&#x27;s campaigns culminated in the Battle of Atbara, and the Battle of Omdurman. Exercising the leverage which their military superiority provided, the British forced Abbas II to accept British control in Sudan. Whereas British influence in Egypt was officially &quot;advisory&quot; (though in reality it was far more direct), the British insisted that their role in Sudan be formalised. Thus, an agreement was reached in 1899 establishing Anglo-Egyptian rule (a condominium), under which Sudan was to be administered by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, much to the revulsion of Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, Sudan was effectively administered as a British imperial possession. Pursuing a policy of divide and rule, the British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership, and sought to frustrate all efforts to further unite the two countries. During World War I, the British invaded and incorporated Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1916.

This policy was internalised within Sudan itself, with the British determined to exacerbate differences and frictions between Sudan&#x27;s numerous different ethnic groups. From 1924 onwards, the British essentially divided Sudan into two separate territories–a predominantly Muslim Arabic-speaking north, and a predominantly Animist and Christian south, where the use of English was encouraged by Christian missionaries, whose main role was instructional.

The continued British occupation of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash in Egypt, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With the formal end in 1914 of the legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty, Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt and Sudan. Upon his death in 1917, his brother Fuad succeeded him as Sultan Fuad I. The insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state persisted when the Sultanate was re-titled the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan, but the British continued to frustrate these efforts.

The failure of the government in Cairo to end the British occupation led to separate efforts for independence in Sudan itself, the first of which was led by a group of Sudanese military officers known as the White Flag League in 1924. The group was led by first lieutenant Ali Abd al Latif and first lieutenant Abdul Fadil Almaz. The latter led an insurrection of the military training academy, which ended in their defeat and the death of Almaz after the British army blew up the military hospital where he was garrisoned. This defeat was alleged to have partially been the result of the Egyptian garrison in Khartoum North not supporting the insurrection with artillery as was previously promised.
=== Abrogation of the condominium ===
Even when the British ended their occupation of Egypt in 1936 (with the exception of the Suez Canal Zone), they maintained their forces in Sudan. Successive governments in Cairo, repeatedly declaring their abrogation of the condominium agreement, declared the British presence in Sudan to be illegitimate, and insisted on full British recognition of King Farouk as &quot;King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot;, a recognition which the British were loath to grant, not least because Farouk was secretly negotiating with Mussolini for an Italian invasion. The defeat of this damaging démarche of 1940 for Anglo-Egyptian relations helped to turn the tide of the Second World War.

It was the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which finally set a series of events in motion which would eventually end the British and Egyptian occupation of Sudan. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt&#x27;s new leaders, Muhammad Naguib, who was raised as the son of an Egyptian army officer in Sudan, and Gamal Abdel Nasser, believed the only way to end the British domination in Sudan was for Egypt itself to officially abandon its sovereignty over Sudan.

Since the British claim to control in Sudan theoretically depended upon Egyptian sovereignty, the revolutionaries calculated that this tactic would leave the UK with no option but to withdraw. In addition, Nasser had known for some time that it would be problematic for Egypt to govern the impoverished Sudan.

=== Transition to independence ===

In 1943 a North Sudan Advisory Council was established bringing a level of self-governance to the northern provinces of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. At a conference held in Juba in 1947, it was decided to integrate the administration of the southern provinces with those of the north. Thirteen appointed representatives from the southern provinces took up seats in the Sudan Legislative Assembly in 1948.

On 12 February 1953, an agreement was reached between Egypt, the United Kingdom and the political representatives of Sudan to transition from condominium to self-government. Sudan was granted self-government in March 1953 and Ismail al-Azhari became Chief Minister in 1954. A constituent assembly was formed and a transitional constitution was drafted. Sudanese representatives would be able to participate in the Afro-Asian Conference planned for April 1955.

In October 1954, the governments of Egypt and the UK signed a treaty that would grant Sudan independence on 1 January 1956. Sudan become an independent sovereign state, the Republic of the Sudan, bringing to an end its nearly 136-year union with Egypt and its 56-year occupation by the British.

== Provinces ==
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was divided into eight provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of World War II. The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala, Khartoum, Kurdufan, Northern, and Upper Nile. In 1948, Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria.

<doc id="985802" wikidata="Q19864" url="?curid=985802" title="Dixons Retail">
<text>Dixons Retail plc was one of the largest consumer electronics retailers in Europe, which merged with Carphone Warehouse in 2014 to create Dixons Carphone, which was renamed Currys plc in 2021. In the United Kingdom, the company operated Currys, Currys Digital, PC World (with stores increasingly dual-branded &#x27;Currys PC World&#x27;), Dixons Travel and its service brand Knowhow.

At the time of the merger in 2014, Dixons Retail had 530 outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland and 322 in Northern Europe. Its Nordic and central European business was operated under the Elkjøp umbrella, and it also operated Kotsovolos in Greece. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

The company, formerly known as Dixons Group plc and later DSG International plc, specialised in selling mass market technology consumer electronics products, audio video equipment, PCs, small and large domestic appliances, photographic equipment, communication products and related financial and after-sales services such as extended service agreements, product set-up and installation, and repairs.

==History==
===Early years===
Dixons was founded as a photographic studio by Charles Kalms and Michael Mindel in the High Street in Southend under the name of Dixons Studios Limited, a company registered in October 1937 with share capital of £100. The name Dixons, selected randomly from the telephone directory, was sufficiently short to fit above the small shop front. In the early 1940s, Dixons set up seven studios around London but by the end of the Second World War the business had been reduced to a single studio in Edgware. Stanley Kalms, the son of the founder, joined the business in 1948 and started advertising direct sales in the press, with postal ordering and delivery.

In 1950, the company began to sell cameras. In 1957, it opened a head office to house the staff now dealing with 60,000 mail order customers and to centralise buying.

Dixons was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1962, changing its name at that time to Dixons Photographic Limited. It bought out competitors Ascotts in 1962, and Bennetts in 1964. In 1967, Dixons bought an colour film processing laboratory in Stevenage. Charles Kalms was succeeded by his son Stanley in 1971. In 1972, Dixons bought another competitor, Wallace Heaton, and in 1974, it opened its Stevenage distribution centre.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In 1984 Dixons acquired Currys, a retail chain with 570 shops selling electrical and other household goods; Currys retained its separate brand identity.

In February 1993, Dixons bought Vision Technology Group (VTG), operating under the PC World brand at Croydon, Lakeside Shopping Centre, Brentford and Staples Corner. Later that year, the company sold VTG&#x27;s mail order division, Dixons US Holdings Inc and Supasnaps. The company opened its first duty free store at Heathrow Terminal 3 in 1994, and later that year launched phone store The Link, the company&#x27;s first venture into communications. The head office moved to Hemel Hempstead.

In November 1996, Dixons bought DN Computer Services, a computer reseller business. It also acquired the retail assets of Harry Moore Ltd, an Irish electrical retailer. Cellnet bought a 40% stake in The Link in April 1997. Also that year, the Dixons website was launched. In 1998, Freeserve, a free Internet service, was launched; it was later sold to France Telecom and renamed Wanadoo. Dixons bought Elkjøp, a Norwegian retailer, in November 1999.

===2000s===
In October 2002, Dixons bought UniEuro, an Italian-based electrical retailer, and Genesis Communications, a mobile phone service provider. The company opened its first Electro World store in Hungary in February 2002. In October 2005, &quot;Dixons Group plc&quot; changed its name to &quot;DSG International plc&quot;.

Further potential expansion came in April 2005, when DSGi bought an interest in Eldorado Group, the largest electrical retailer in Russia and Ukraine, with an option to buy the rest by 2011 for US$1.9 billion (about £1 billion GBP). This option was not pursued, DSGi withdrawing their interest in April 2007.

In May 2006, DSGi was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise. The company announced that the Dixons brand would continue purely online and that all high street stores would be rebranded Currys.digital. DSGi also bought 75% of Fotovista, a French photographic business. In January 2008, DSGi announced that it would stop selling analogue televisions and only sell integrated digital televisions, in an effort to get consumers ready for the digital switchover.

In May 2008, DSGi announced that it would close 77 of its 177 Currys.digital shops in the United Kingdom, as their building leases expired over the following five years.

===2010s===
In May 2010, the company secured almost exclusive rights to sell the Apple iPad. In June 2010, DSGi changed its name to &quot;Dixons Retail plc&quot;.

===Merger with Carphone Warehouse===
In May 2014, Dixons announced a merger, that soon came to pass, with Carphone Warehouse; the combined company would have market capitalisation of around £3.8 billion. Dixons thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dixons Carphone Holdings Limited, and was renamed to Dixons Retail Group plc. Sebastian James, who had been Dixons CEO since 2012, was appointed as CEO of Dixons Carphone.

==Operations==
As of 2014, Dixons had 530 outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and 322 in northern Europe. The company is structured according to the international locations of its businesses and brands, as detailed below:

Dixons&#x27; brand lineup underwent a major reorganisation during 2010. , the brands in use include the following:

* Essentials – Includes Currys Essentials and PC World Essentials.

* Advent – Established PC World brand used for computers, peripherals and other accessories.
* Sandstrøm – Intended to compete with higher end consumer electronics brands, Sandstrøm is claimed to be &quot;inspired by Scandinavian design [and] designed to combine aesthetics with performance.&quot;
* Goji – Producer of equipment including computers, smartphones and audio products as well as bags and storage. Distributed by Dixons Group.

===Former===

* Prinz/Prinzsound/Prinztronic – The Prinz brand was first used on Japanese manufactured goods during Dixons&#x27; 1950s expansion.
* Miranda – Originally the name of a Japanese company, Dixons acquired the brand in 1981, and used it on cameras and photographic kit. As of 2011, Dixons still owned rights to the name, but no longer used it and planned to sell it off.
* Saisho – Introduced in 1982. Dixons announced its intention to sell the brand off in May 2011.

* Matsui – Introduced in the 1980s by Currys as a brand for its consumer electronics goods assembled in the United Kingdom, using imported components. Products in the Matsui line involved neither Japanese parts nor Japanese labour, but were branded with a Japanese sounding name, a rising sun symbol and the motto &quot;Japanese Technology Made Perfect&quot;&#x27;. The brand was retired in 2010 as part of the company&#x27;s rationalisation of own labels.
*Carlton – was used by Currys for own brand white goods.

<text>The National Copper Corporation of Chile (), abbreviated as Codelco, is a Chilean state-owned copper mining company. It was formed in 1976 from foreign-owned copper companies that were nationalised in 1971.

The headquarters are in Santiago and the seven-man board of directors is appointed by the President of the Republic. It has the Minister of Mining as its president and six other members including the Minister of Finance and one representative each from the Copper Workers Federation and the National Association of Copper Supervisors.

It is currently the largest copper producing company in the world and produced 1.66 million tonnes of copper in 2007, 11% of the world total. It owns the world&#x27;s largest known copper reserves and resources. At the end of 2007 it had a total of reserves and resources of 118 million tonnes of copper in its mining plan, sufficient for more than 70 years of operation at current production rates. It also has additional identified resources of 208 million tonnes of copper, though one cannot say how much of this may prove economic.

Codelco&#x27;s principal product is cathode copper. It is also one of the world&#x27;s largest molybdenum producers, producing 27,857 fine metric tons in 2007, and is a large producer of rhenium, of which Chile is the world&#x27;s largest producer. It also produces small amounts of gold and silver from refinery anode slimes, the residue from electro refining of copper.

==History==

Codelco&#x27;s history begins with Law 11,828, of May 5, 1955, that created the &quot;Copper Office&quot; (&quot;Departamento del Cobre&quot;) of the Chilean government, approved under President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. During the administration of President Eduardo Frei Montalva, Congress sanctioned Law 16,425, on January 25, 1966, and transformed the &quot;Copper Office&quot; into the &quot;Copper Corporation of Chile&quot; (Codelco).

With the constitutional reform that nationalized copper (Law 17,450 July 11, 1971), during President Salvador Allende&#x27;s government, full ownership of all copper mines and copper fields in the country were transferred to Codelco. The creation of the &quot;Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile&quot;, as it is currently known, was formalized by decree of April 1, 1976, under the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.

Codelco&#x27;s symbol is based on the alchemical symbol for copper.

==The company==
Codelco consists of research, exploration, acquisition and development departments. It has five principal operating divisions, Codelco Norte, Salvador, Andina, Ventanas and El Teniente, and a 49% interest in the El Abra Mine. It has several other potential mining operations under exploration and development including the Alejandro Hales, Gaby/Gabriela Mistral, the Toki Cluster, Mocha, and Casualidad projects. All excess profits go to the government, including a 10% tax on foreign currency sales (Law 13,196). In 2007 Codelco paid US$7.394 billion to the Chilean Treasury. Codelco has negotiated a 7-year US$3.0 billion syndicated loan which, with the US$1.96 billion in cash and cash equivalent at the end of 2007 leaves the corporation well placed to finance the several new projects that it is investigating.

==Divisions==

===Codelco Norte===
Codelco Norte is a division of Codelco that is made of the Chuquicamata and Radomiro Tomic mining areas.

====Chuquicamata====
Copper has been mined for centuries at Chuquicamata as was shown by the discovery in 1898 of &quot;Copper Man&quot;, a mummy dated at about 550 A.D. which was found trapped in an ancient mine shaft by a fall of rock. However mining on any scale did not start until the later years of the 19th century and these early operations mined the high grade veins (10-15% copper) and disregarded the low grade disseminated ore. One attempt was made to process the low grade ore in 1899-1900 by Norman Walker, a partner in La Compañia de Cobre de Antofagasta, but it failed leaving the company deeply in debt.

The modern era started when the American engineer Bradley finally developed a method of working low grade oxidised copper ores. In 1910 he approached the lawyer and industrialist Albert C Burrage who sent engineers to examine Chuquicamata. Their reports were good and in April 1911 he started to buy up mines and claims in association with Duncan Fox y Cia., an English entrepreneur.
Unfortunately, Burrage did not have the capital to develop a mine so he approached the Guggenheim Brothers. They examined his claims and estimated reserves at 690 million tonnes grading 2.58% copper. The Guggenheims also had a process for treating the low grade ores developed by E A Cappelen Smith and were immediately interested, organised the Chile Exploration Company (Chilex) in January 1912 and eventually bought out Burrage for US$25 million in Chilex stock.

=====The modern mine=====
Chilex then went ahead with the development and construction of a mine on the eastern section of the Chuquicamata field - it acquired the remainder gradually over the next 15 years - and a 10,000 tons per day leaching plant which was planned to produce 50,000 tons of electrolytic copper annually. Amongst the equipment purchased were steam shovels from the Panama Canal. A port and oil-fired power plant were built at Tocopilla, 90 miles to the west and an aqueduct was constructed to bring water in from the Andes. Production started on May 18, 1915. Actual production rose from 4345 tonnes in the first year to 50,400 tonnes in 1920 and 135,890 tonnes in 1929 before the Depression hit and demand fell. The Guggenheims gave up control of the mine in 1923 when they sold 51% to Anaconda Copper, which acquired most of the remainder in 1929. Anaconda ran the mine until the 1960s when the Chilean state acquired a 51% holding in the &quot;Chilenization&quot; of the copper industry. In 1971 the mine was nationalised and in 1976 was incorporated into Codelco.

Production from the capping of oxidised minerals, which required mere leaching in sulphuric acid to dissolve the copper and the recovery of the copper by electrolysis was the sole means of production until the 1950s. However their gradual depletion forced the construction of a mill and flotation plant in 1961 to treat the underlying secondary sulphides. These have been steadily expanded until recently the pit was producing over 600,000 tonnes of copper annually, though this has now fallen with the lower grades as the richer secondary mineralisation is also depleted in the three porphyries that make up the orebody.

The present mine is a conventional truck and shovel operation, with a large proportion of the ore crushed in-pit and transported by underground conveyors to the mill bins. The 182,000 tonnes p.a. concentrator is also conventional and is primary crushing followed by SAG mills and ball mills with cyclone classification. The flotation section produces both copper and molybdenum concentrates. The 1.65 million tonnes p.a. of concentrate are smelted in one Outokumpu flash smelter and one Teniente converter with electric furnace and cylindrical slag cleaning followed by four Pierce Smith converters. The blister copper goes to six anode furnaces which feed three anode casting wheels. The anodes go on to the 855,000 tonnes p.a. electrolytic refinery.

=====The future of Chuquicamata=====
Plans to go underground and mine the rest of the Chuquicamata orebody by block caving are now well advanced. At the SIMIN conference in 2007 in Santiago Codelco engineers detailed a possible future mining plan. The open pit is becoming gradually uneconomic and it was estimated that mining would slow down and stop by 2020. In the meantime the mill will be kept up to its 182,000 tonnes per day capacity with sulphides from Radomiro Tomic and Alejandro Hales. The underground mine will start up in 2018 and when it reaches full capacity of 120,000 tonnes per day in 2030, the balance of the tonnage will come from the Alejandro Hales underground mine. It is estimated that extractable underground reserves below the present pit total 1,150 million tonnes of ore grading 0.76% copper and 0.052% molybdenum.

This remarkable mine was for many years the world&#x27;s largest annual producer until overtaken recently by Escondida and it is one of the largest ever copper mining excavation. It has produced over 29 million tonnes of copper in total, far more than any other mine

====Radomiro Tomic====
The Radomiro Tomic deposit, 5 km north of the main pit, was discovered in 1952 when Anaconda conducted an extensive churn drilling programme to explore for oxidised ore to the north of the Chuquicamata pit. It was named Chuqui Norte but they did not develop it, largely because the technology had not been developed, particularly SX/EW. Two smaller areas of interest were found and the overall results showed that the Chuquicamata complex of mineralised porphyries is no less than 14 km long.

The deposit is covered with some 100 metres of alluvium and in 1993/94 Codelco estimated a resource base for the operation of 802 million tonnes of oxide ore grading 0.59% copper and 1,600 million tonnes of refractory (sulphide) ore. The deposit covers an area of 5 km x 1.5 km.

Mining started in 1997 and is again a conventional truck and shovel operation followed by crushing, pre treatment and stacking before acid leaching. Copper is extracted by SX/EW. Leached ore is removed by bucket wheel excavator followed by secondary leaching. It is likely that the &#x27;refractory&#x27; sulphide ore will be mined and used to keep the Chuquicamata mill full during the changeover to underground mining. The last published production by Radomiro Tomic, from Cochilco, was 379,600 tonnes in 2013.

====Northern expansion of Mina Sur====
Between the main pit and Mina Sur there remains a substantial tonnage of so-called exotic copper in the channel of paleogravels (ancient gravels) between the two and which were mined in Mina Sur. The minerals, thought to be deposited by colloidal copper solutions leached from the main deposit, included manganese bearing copper pitch and copper wad, along with other impurities which made the ore difficult to leach in the original vats and produced a substandard cathode. The &#x27;exotic&#x27; ore is now being heap leached and the copper extracted by SX/EW which leaves the impurities behind in the leach solution. It is expected that this operation will produce 129,000 tonnes of good quality copper cathode annually.

====Secondary waste dump leach====
This is the leaching of certain copper bearing waste dumps and is expected to produce 26,000 tonnes of copper annually.

====Ministro Alejandro Hales (formerly Mansa Mina)====
This is a major discovery that was made between Chuquicamata and Calama. It was initially estimated to have reserves of over 500 million tonnes grading over 1% copper, but was found to be geologically complex and have a high arsenic content and work was stopped on it for some years. Work resumed in 2000, as a result of the development of a process to treat high arsenic ores, the need for sulphide ore feed to the mill when Chuquicamata&#x27;s mining goes underground and to test bioleaching technology. It is also possible that it may enable an expansion of the sulphide mill&#x27;s capacity.

====Pollution====
For many years Chuquicamata, particularly its smelter, was a byword for pollution and the inhabitants of the Chuquicamata camp and Calama had serious amounts of arsenic in their blood. This has changed drastically. The camp at Chuquicamata has been closed and the inhabitants moved to Calama, away from the dust and general pollution close to the mine.

The off gasses from the flash smelter, Teniente converter and Pierce-Smith converters have a high enough sulphur dioxide content to allow sulphuric acid production in a single absorption sulphuric acid plant which has improved sulphur capture to 98%. The corporation also planned some years ago to reduce arsenic emissions by 97% but there have been no recent reports. Pollution of the River Loa, which flows through Calama is a problem which is being addressed but little has been reported.

===Salvador===

The El Salvador mine is a combined open pit and underground copper mine in the company town of El Salvador. The El Salvador mine was purchased by Anaconda Copper, who had little intention of mining it, due to high tax rates by the Chilean government. When the tax rates were reduced Anaconda decided to bring the mine into production. Production at the mine began in the early 1960s, and was intended to replace production of the company&#x27;s Potrerillos mine, which would be closing. Production from the El Salvador would increase Chile&#x27;s total output of copper about 450,000 tons of copper per year, rather than a decrease in production, out of satisfaction and relief, the company renamed the mine El Salvador, Spanish The Savior. In 2005 Codelco had planned to shut down the El Salvador mine in 2011 because of declining ore grades and increased costs, but extended the project life by an additional 15–20 years.
They&#x27; also have a new project call San Antonio that would be located in the old mine at Potrerillos. The General Manager is Jaime Rojas, the General Counsel is Oscar Lira, the sustainability and external affairs manager y Rodrigo Vargas and the Human Resources manager is Ariel Guajardo.

===Andina===
Situated some 80 km northeast of the capital, Santiago, the Andina mine was discovered in 1920 but production did not start until 1970. It consists of the Rio Blanco underground (block cave) mine and the Sur Sur open pit and an underground concentrator. Unlike other Codelco mines, it does not have its own smelter. Geologically it consists of about half the Los Bronces-Rio Blanco complex of mineralised breccias, the other half being owned and mined by the Los Bronces mine of Compania Minera Disputada de la Condes which is in turn owned by Anglo American.

Originally owned by the American Cerro De Pasco Corporation, who brought the mine to production, it has been gradually built up by Codelco and is now the subject of a major expansion scheme. At the end of 2007, reserves and resources in the mining plan totalled 5,698 million tonnes grading 0.78% copper containing 44.3 million tonnes of metal and additional identified resources of 11,342 tonnes grading 0.52% copper containing 59.6 million tonnes of metal.

The orebodies are at considerable heights, between 3,000 and 4,200 metres and operations can be severely affected by the weather. Originally the mine was only the underground block cave and an underground concentrator with an &quot;hotel&quot; (bunkhouse) where the workers live when the Rio Blanco valley is impassable in the winter. Now the Sur Sur and Don Luis breccias above and to the south of the underground mine are being worked as open pits. Production in 2007 was 218,322 tonnes of extractable copper and 2,525 tonnes molybdenum in concentrate from the 72,000 tonnes per day concentrator.

Work is now under way on the Andina Phase I Development Project which aims to raise mill capacity to 92,000 tonnes per day and is expected to be complete by November 2009. Pre feasibility studies on raising mill capacity to over 200,000 tonnes per day by 2014 should be complete this year. Deep drilling to prove up resources to sustain such a production rate continue. No estimates of the likely copper output at a milling rate of 200,000 tonnes per day have been given and cannot be until the deep drilling campaign is complete.

One of the mysteries of Andina is why it did not buy Compania Minera Disputada de las Condes when Peñarroya was prepared to sell it for a very low price in 1972. It went to Enami who subsequently sold it for a handsome profit to Exxon Minerals for US$97 million. It would have given Codelco complete control of the district. When Exxon finally did decide to sell in 2002, Codelco expressed interest but were not prepared to match the US$1.3 billion that Anglo American were prepared to give for it.

Rock glaciers have been seriously intervened by Andina since the late 1980s, when it started to deposit several million tons of waste rock on top of rock glaciers, resulting in their acceleration and partial destabilisation. Since then, 2.1 km2 of rock glaciers with a water equivalent of more than 15 million cubic metres have been affected by Andina, including the partial removal of rock glaciers.

In November 2024, Codelco applied for an environmental permit for a $650 million project with aims to make water use in its Andlina mine more sustainable. The Andina project in central Chile has faced a decade of drought and will require a maximum of 1,650 workers and take about 36 months to complete.

===El Teniente===
Situated 44 km east of Rancagua and 75 km south of the capital, Santiago, El Teniente claims to be the largest underground copper mine in the world (see below). The El Teniente orebody has been known and worked on a small scale for many years. In the 16th century it became the property of the Jesuits as it was located on their Hacienda de la Compañia de Jesús. They operated a small mine known as the Socavón de los Jesuitas. Following their expulsion, the hacienda was acquired in 1768 by Don Mateo de Toro y Zambrano y Ureta. Between 1819 and 1823 his heirs restarted and enlarged the workings, bringing in a mining engineer to help. However, these and subsequent attempts to establish anything more than a small scale mine failed for lack of capital and the property was eventually bought by the American, William Braden, for approximately US$100,000. The same year Braden formed Rancagua Mines, which became the Braden Copper Company, in association with old colleagues from ASARCO, including Barton Sewell.

Work started on establishing a mine in 1905 after Government permission had been acquired but progress was slow because of difficulty of access and a hard winter climate. A small gravity plant was soon erected but it was not until 1912 that a flotation plant was erected at Sewell. Control passed to Kennecott in 1915 and it ran the mine until nationalisation in 1971.

====The present mine====
The porphyry orebody consists of a stockwork (a network of narrow veins) of mineralised veinlets, mainly in andesitic lavas and tonalite, superimposed by a leached zone and a substantial zone of secondary enrichment, both of very variable thickness. It surrounds a narrow, almost circular ring of tourmaline breccia which in turn surrounds the Braden Chimney, an inverted cone of breccia which was emplaced after the main mineralisation. Reserves and resources are substantial. At the end of 2007 reserves and resources in the mining plan totalled 4,204 million tonnes grading 0.91% copper or 38.3 million tonnes of contained copper. In addition the mine has identified additional resources of 15,827 million tonnes grading 0.46% copper or nearly 73 million tonnes of contained copper though there is no indication how much of this may prove economic. Production in 2007 was 404,728 tonnes copper and 5,053 tonnes molybdenum.

Mining is gradually moving lower and removing the ore between the barren country rock and the Braden Chimney. Access is through adits (horizontal tunnels) to shafts and other services cut in the Braden Chimney. Mining methods include panel caving, panel caving with pre-undercut, and block caving, which have been adapted to overcome the serious rockburst problem which stopped mining some years ago on level 6 and threatened the future of the mine. A new level, Level 8, is now in operation and another, lower, level is being studied which will give access to 1.5 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.96% copper and extend the life of the mine by many years.

All ore is now treated in the lower Colón mill, the original Sewell mill being closed. Capacity is now 130,000 tonnes daily, split equally between SAG and conventional milling, followed by flotation, thickening and filtration. The recent increase in mill capacity has been necessary to compensate for the gradual move of mining into the lower grade primary ore zone. The concentrate goes to the Caletones smelter further down the valley. This is equipped with two Teniente converters with slag furnaces, three Pierce Smith converters and six anode furnaces feeding two anode and one fire refined casting wheels. Tailings are flumed down the valley to dams on flatter ground. An independent company, Minera Valle Central, retreats old and current El Teniente tailings and extracts some 12,000 tonnes p.a. of copper in concentrate.

====Sewell====
Sewell, the original mine camp and known as the &#x27;city of stairs&#x27; because it looked as though it had been poured down the mountain, has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 1906 by William Braden to house his mine workers and had a population of around 15,000 at its peak. It was closed down in the late 1980s as all the workers moved down to Rancagua.

===El Abra===
Codelco sold a 51% interest in its El Abra deposit in 1994 to Cyprus-Amax (now part of Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold) who then developed it. Production started in 1996. It is a porphyry copper with an extensive capping of leachable oxide and sulphide mineralisation. Production over the next three years is expected to be in the 152,000 to 168,000 tonnes copper p.a. from the 227,000 tonnes p.a.capacity SX/EW plant. It is planned to exploit the underlying sulphides starting in 2010 which should extend the mine life by over 10 years.

===Other projects===
The Gabriela Mistral (&quot;Gaby&quot;) Project is an oxide copper project located 120 km south of Calama. Reserves are estimated at 580 million tonnes of oxide ore grading 1.41% copper and there is underlying sulphide mineralisation but this is not being considered at present. A 14-year open pit leaching and SX/EW operation producing about 150,000 tonnes of copper annually is planned. Startup was in 2008 marking the milestone to be the first mine in the world to introduce the full autonomous trucks from [Komatsu]. Leaching of tailings with the potential to produce and additional 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes p.a. between 2011 and 2014 is being investigated, as is wind power. An &#x27;exotic copper&#x27; orebody, &quot;Vicky&quot; has also been found in the Gabriela Mistral area with potential estimated resources of 80 million tons of oxide ore with a copper grade of 0.6%. A 44,000 m2 central solar heating plant supplies 80% of the 80 GWh annual heat for an electrowinning copper extraction process, despite dust problems.

The Toki Cluster is a group of porphyries that is now included in the Codelco Norte division. In 2004 the resources in the four porphyries found to date was estimated at 18 million tonnes of copper. Since then a fifth, &quot;Miranda&quot;, has been found containing estimated resources of 2.5 million tonnes of copper.

===Ventanas===
Ventanas is a smelter situated on the coast 35 km north of Valparaiso. It was transferred from ENAMI in May 2005. It processes concentrates and anodes from Andina and El Teniente, amongst other producers, and makes Codelco increasingly self-sufficient. The &#x27;New Ventanas Project&#x27; is investigating the feasibility of converting it into a large scale smelting and refining complex.

The plant consists of a Teniente converter with electric furnace slag cleaning, three Pierce Smith converters, a rotary anode furnace and two reverbatory refining furnaces and two anode casting wheels. Capacity is 450,000 tonnes p.a. concentrate to produce 110,000 tonnes copper annually. Off gasses go to a Hugo Petersen sulphuric acid plant. The refinery produces cathode copper, and gold, silver and selenium are produced from the anode slime left over from the refining process.

==Codelco outside Chile==
On July 26, 2012, the Chilean and Ecuadorian government signed an agreement to activate the highly controversial Junin copper mining project, in the Intag area of Northwestern Ecuador. The agreement calls for Codelco, jointly with the Ecuadorian national mining company- ENAMI- to begin exploration activities in the biodiverse Cordillera de Toisan after the second quarter of 2013. The project would be one of the first experience for the Chilean-owned company outside the Chilean deserts where it has most of its mines. It is controversial because Intag is the same area where communities have forced two transnational mining companies to abandon exploration activities due to widespread rejection of mining activities (Mitsubishi subsidiary in 1997 and Canadian Copper Mesa in 2009).

<text>Richard William Stephen Shaw (December 8, 1966 – June 9, 2019), better known by his stage name Bushwick Bill, was a Jamaican rapper. He was a member of the Texas hip hop group Geto Boys, a group he originally joined as a breakdancer in 1986 as Little Billy. He went on to become one third of one incarnation of the group, alongside Willie D and Scarface.

== Early life ==
Bushwick Bill was born Richard William Stephen Shaw on December 8, 1966, in Kingston, Jamaica. His father was a merchant mariner, and his mother was a maid. Shaw was born with dwarfism and as an adult was listed as tall.

== Career ==
Shaw got his start in the music industry in 1986 as a member of the Geto Boys, where he performed as a dancer known as Little Billy. He later transitioned to rapping, and was featured on the Geto Boys&#x27; debut album, &quot;Making Trouble&quot; in 1988. The album received little attention and negative reviews, which led to Rap-A-Lot dropping all members from the group except for Bill and DJ Ready Red. Soon after, Rap-A-Lot CEO J. Prince recruited Scarface and Willie Dee, two local aspiring artists out of Texas as the second incarnation of the group. The new lineup began recording together in 1988 and their debut project as a group and second overall for the Geto Boys, &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot; was released in 1989 to much better reception, being considered a classic album and one of the earliest entries into the Horrorcore genre. It was around this time the group&#x27;s lyrical content began to generate controversy, which was multiplied in 1991 when the cover of the group&#x27;s third album &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot; depicted a graphic image of Bill moments after he shot himself during an argument with his girlfriend. Nevertheless, the album went on to be their most successful to that point, being certified platinum in 1992.

Bushwick Bill can be heard on the album &quot;The Chronic&quot; by Dr. Dre; he appears in the video of &quot;Dre Day&quot; as one of Eazy-E&#x27;s fellow rappers. His 1998 album &quot;No Surrender...No Retreat&quot; was dedicated to his friend Gil Epstein, a Fort Bend County prosecutor who was shot dead in Houston, Texas, in 1996.

== Personal life ==
On June 19, 1991, during an argument with his girlfriend (who was also the mother of his child), Bill was shot in the face. He lost his right eye as a result. Reports vary as to who actually fired the gun, as both participants&#x27; hands were on the weapon during the altercation. Bill has clarified that he was suicidal and attempting to force her into killing him, even going as far as to threaten their sons&#x27; life. It has also been suggested that part of the motivation was an attempt to score life insurance money for his mother. He had been under the influence of Everclear grain alcohol and PCP. The aftermath of the incident was documented on the album cover for Geto Boys&#x27; 1991 album &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot;, which shows Shaw being pushed through the hospital on a gurney by bandmates Willie D and Scarface. Shaw claimed he &quot;died and came back to life&quot; during the incident, and he made reference to it in his music.
In 2006, he became a born-again Christian.
In May 2010, Shaw was arrested in Georgia for possession of marijuana and cocaine. Based on his prior arrest record and not being an American citizen, he faced deportation.

== Illness and death ==
On May 1, 2019, Shaw revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Over a month later, on June 9, reports emerged that Shaw had died, but news of his death was later refuted by his son. However, it was subsequently reported and confirmed that Shaw died later that day at a hospital in Denver, Colorado.

<doc id="985813" wikidata="Q6805028" url="?curid=985813" title="Medal for Humane Action">
<text>The Medal for Humane Action was a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was created by an act (63 Stat. 477) of the United States Congress on July 20, 1949. The medal recognizes those military service members who performed extended duty in support of the Berlin Airlift. The medal is based on the design of the Berlin Airlift Device.

==Criteria==
This medal was created for the single purpose of recognizing service during a single action (the Berlin Airlift) and was never issued again. The specific criteria for receipt of this award was established by , &quot;Regulations governing the award of the Medal for Humane Action,&quot; of February 7, 1952. To be awarded the Medal for Humane Action a service member was required to have performed over 120 days of duty, within the geographical boundary of Berlin, with such duty being in support of the Berlin Airlift between June 26, 1948 and September 30, 1949. Posthumous award may be made to any person who lost his life while, or as a direct result of, participating in the Berlin airlift, without regard to the length of such service, if otherwise eligible. Those so qualifying were also eligible for either the Army of Occupation Medal, or the Navy Occupation Service Medal, respectively with the Berlin Airlift Device, and both medals were authorized for simultaneous award and display.

==Description==
The medal was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones of the Army Heraldic Section and is made of bronze and round, in diameter. It depicts a Douglas C-54 Skymaster over a wheat wreath. At the center of the wreath is the Coat of arms of Berlin. The reverse bears the eagle, shield, and arrows from the seal of the Department of Defense and reads &quot;For Humane Action / To Supply Necessities of Life to the People of Berlin Germany&quot;. The medal is suspended by a ribbon primarily of teal blue with black edges separated by thin white stripes. In the center is a red stripe with thin white stripes separating it from the teal.

<doc id="985814" wikidata="Q1641993" url="?curid=985814" title="Trust (rock band)">
<text>Trust are a French hard rock band, founded in 1977 and popular in Europe in the first half of the 1980s. They are best known for guitarist Norbert &quot;Nono&quot; Krief&#x27;s prowess, for Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; Bonvoisin&#x27;s voice (reminiscent of AC/DC&#x27;s Bon Scott) and for lyrics about social and political themes. The drummers Nicko McBrain and Clive Burr, each of whom is famous for having been a member of Iron Maiden, were at different times in the 1980s part of the Trust line-up. The band disbanded in 1985 and reformed in the 2000s for live shows and new recordings.

==History==
Trust were founded in 1977 by Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; Bonvoisin (vocals, lyricist), Norbert &quot;Nono&quot; Krief (guitar, composer), Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Manna (bass) and Jean-Émile &quot;Jeannot&quot; Hanela (drums). The band released their first single &quot;Prends Pas Ton Flingue&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Take Your Gun with You&quot;) in the same year. This record was re-released when the band made their first short-lived comeback in 1992.

Trust rose to fame in 1979 and 1980 with their music, which mixed hard rock influences, acerbic social and political commentary, anarchist undertones and a renegade attitude similar to that of MC5. Trust&#x27;s success was also due to Krief&#x27;s stature as a French guitar hero and Bonvoisin&#x27;s sincere and mature lyrics, as well as his raw energy in live performances. Their 1980 hit song &quot;Antisocial&quot; from the album &quot;Répression&quot; criticized the frenetic, dehumanizing pace of modern life and work in large cities. &quot;Le Mitard&quot;, from the same album, attacked what Trust claimed was an excessively repressive handling of juvenile delinquency, featuring texts from public enemy number one Jacques Mesrine and the song &quot;Monsieur Comédie&quot; criticizes Ayatollah Khomeini, who was in exile in France at the time, depicting him as a &quot;torturer&quot;. To translate the songs&#x27; aggressive political messages Trust were helped on English lyrics for the &quot;Répression&quot; album by Jimmy Pursey of British punk band Sham 69. The English adaptation of the song &quot;Antisocial&quot;, however, is pretty rough, and the lyrics are mild compared to the originals. While the first four lines in the French version translate to &quot;You spend a lifetime working to pay for your own tombstone, You hide your face behind the newspaper, You walk like a robot in the subway corridors, Nobody cares about your presence, It&#x27;s up to you to make the first step&quot;, the English version reads &quot;You&#x27;re a train ride to no importance, You&#x27;re in love with hell existence, Money is all that you desire, Why don&#x27;t you pack it in and retire&quot;.

Other major political songs includes &quot;Darquier&quot; (7&quot; single, 1979) commenting on notorious Nazi Germany collaborator Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, &quot;Les Brutes&quot; (from the 1981 album &quot;Marche ou Crève&quot;) describes the savage acts done by the Warsaw Pact military forces at the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, &quot;H &amp; D&quot; (from the 1979 album L&#x27;Élite), with &quot;H &amp; D&quot; standing for &quot;Hôpital &amp; Débiles&quot; (&quot;Asylum &amp; Psychos&quot;), accuses the Soviet Union and its secret services (KGB) of suppressing dissent by sending political opponents to psychiatric hospitals under fake diagnoses.

The style of singer Bernie Bonvoisin was compared to that of Bon Scott from AC/DC, with whom Trust had a friendly relationship. &quot;Ride On&quot; by AC/DC was covered on Trust&#x27;s 1979 debut album. In fact, their debut single &quot;Prends pas ton flingue&quot;, from 1977, had a French adaption of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Love at First Feel&quot; (&quot;Paris by Night&quot;) as its B-side. The &quot;Répression dans l&#x27;Hexagone&quot; (&quot;Repression in the Hexagon&quot;) live album, recorded in 1980, featured the covers of the AC/DC songs &quot;Problem Child&quot; and &quot;Live Wire&quot;. The album was released as &quot;Trust Live&quot; in 1992, twelve years after its recording by Sony Music France coinciding with AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Live&quot; album release in France. However, the band members denied using such a marketing strategy, claiming the masters they thought were lost had been found the same year by coincidence.

By 1983, after releasing three successful albums in a row and with worldwide touring, opening for Iron Maiden and others, the band came under increasing criticism for its less &quot;incisive&quot; sound, the use of synthesizers and the frequent changes of drummers — e.g. Nicko McBrain quit the band after &quot;Savage&quot;, the English version of &quot;Marche ou Crève&quot; (march or die) to join Iron Maiden). The former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr went the opposite way, before himself quitting after recording the 1983 album &quot;Trust IV (Idéal)&quot;. After disappointing record sales of the latest album &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;, Trust disbanded in 1985, with Bonvoisin concentrating on his subsequent solo career and Krief joining the &#x27;French Elvis&#x27; Johnny Hallyday as a lead guitarist both in the studio and live from 1985 to 1993.

Meanwhile, the band&#x27;s most successful song &quot;Antisocial&quot; was covered (in English) in 1988 by Anthrax on their &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; album and became one of their most popular songs and videos. A year later Anthrax also recorded the French version of the song, which is featured on their 1989 EP &quot;Penikufesin&quot;. A live version of the 12&quot; single for Anthrax&#x27;s song &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot; features Bernie Bonvoisin on vocals together with Anthrax singer Joey Belladonna. Bolstered by a sudden worldwide interest in the band, Trust was added to the 1988 Monsters of Rock Festival in Paris. At this occasion the live album &quot;Paris by Night&quot; was recorded and released internationally by Megaforce Records, the home label of both Metallica and Anthrax. The band kept on touring in 1989 and released a stop-gap covers and outtakes album, titled &quot;En attendant&quot; (literally &quot;while waiting&quot;), before disbanding yet again.

Trust reunited around Krief and Bonvoisin with a new studio album &quot;Europe et haines&quot; in 1996 (literally translating to &quot;europe and hate&quot;, while being pronounced &quot;european&quot; in french), signing a contract with Warner. After some touring and another live-album, Bonvoisin and Krief split over differences concerning the recording of the follow-up studio album &quot;Ni Dieu, ni maitre&quot; (Neither God nor Master), which was independently released by Krief in 2000 before being pulled from the shelves after an intervention by Bonvoisin.

In early July 2006, Trust&#x27;s extended classic line-up, later upgraded by a DJ, reformed to perform a gig at the Festival des Terres Neuvas, which was later released as a live album. After a jubilee gig in 2007, 30 years after their first appearance on stage at the Paris Olympia venue, an album of all-new material, &quot;13 à table&quot; (&quot;Thirteen at the Table&quot;) was recorded and released in September 2008.

In 2012, Bonvoisin stated that there would be no Trust reunification and also no remastered albums. However, later in the year the band was added to the Sonisphere France line-up, but cancelled soon afterward. Bonvoisin started touring in 2013 with a line-up excluding Krief under the moniker &quot;Kollektif AK47&quot; before disbanding again.

Since 2016 and on the occasion of their upcoming 40th anniversary 2017, Trust have been touring and recording regularly again with a, for once, stable line-up, releasing three albums of new material (all of them recorded under &quot;live&quot; conditions and mixed by Mike Fraser) and a box set of their first three albums, re-recorded with updated lyrics.

<text>Nazir Sabir (Urdu: نذیر صابر) is a Pakistani mountaineer. He was born in Hunza. He has climbed Mount Everest and four of the five 8000 m peaks in Pakistan, including the world&#x27;s second highest mountain K2 in 1981, Gasherbrum II 8035m, Broad Peak 8050m in 1982, and Gasherbrum I (Hidden Peak) 8068m in 1992. He became the first from Pakistan to have climbed Everest on 17 May 2000 as a team member on the Mountain Madness Everest Expedition led by Christine Boskoff from the United States that also included famed Everest climber Peter Habeler of Austria and eight Canadians.

==Climbing career==
Sabir began his Himalayan climbing career with a Japanese expedition to the 7284m Passu Peak in Hunza in 1974. In 1975 he was part of a German Expedition as a trainee that attempted Nanga Parbat (8125m) and only went to 6700m up the south west ridge. On 17 July 1976 he made the first ascent of 6660m virgin Paiyu followed by Colonel Manzoor Hussain and Major Bashir with the first Pakistani expedition organised by the Alpine Club of Pakistan. 

In 1977 Sabir joined the largest Japan/Pakistan joint expedition to K2, attempting the traditional South East Abruzzi Ridge. It was a huge expedition, using bottled oxygen; this team had an army of 1500 porters and 52 members. However Sabir&#x27;s first assault team including four Japanese had to turn back due to snow storms from 8280m. Another attempt with the same team had to be abandoned again from 8150m when they had to come down searching for two missing colleagues who were found alive below Camp 4 the next day. However they put seven members of the team on the summit making the second ascent of K3. Till then only two mountaineers of the 1954 successful Italian expedition had stepped on the K2 Summit.

Sabir was invited to climb K2 in 1981 by his friends by the Waseda University Expedition attempting the West and South West ridges rather than the usual Abruzzi ridge. The Duke of Abruzzi had, in 1909, surveyed K2 from all its sides. He felt that K2 could only be assailed from the South East Ridge, which was to be named Abruzzi Ridge. 
In 1978 the famous British climber Chris Bonington made his first attempt on this new route up the West Ridge. Nick Estcourt, a member of this team, was swept to his death by a slab avalanche on the way to Camp 2 while Doug Scott barely survived. It involves a difficult grade on a mixed ground of snow and rock at higher elevations. Scott, who was a member of the 1978 expedition, led another team strong teams of five top British climbers but they gave up at 7300m due to bad weather.

Sabir, followed by Eiho Otani, reached the summit of K2 on 7 August 1981. Sabir and his team from the Waseda University created history by successfully climbing K2&#x27;s West/South West Ridge for the first time. A documentary film of the climb, &quot;50 Day Struggle&quot; was shown all over Japan, and made Sabir a household name there. 

In 1982, Sabir along with Sher Khan and the famous Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner climbed Gasherbrum II 8035m and Broad Peak 8047m. Both Gasherbrum II and Broad Peak were done in alpine style in a period of just one week, the fastest ascent of two 8000m peaks at the time.

==Expeditions to Nanga Parbat==
He made three attempts on Nanga Parbat. His first was in October 1981, two months after his big success on K2 when he joined his friends from the Sangaku Doshikai Club Tokyo led by M. Omiya. They followed the first serious attempt route of Albert Frederick Mummery. Nanga Parbat claimed its first of many victims when Mummery and his Gurkha colleagues mysteriously disappeared in the Diamir Glacier never to be found again. Nazir and the Japanese abandoned their climb due to the heavy crevasses on the Diamir Glacier and avalanches after heavy snow fall that autumn.

He then challenged the S/S West Face also known as Schell Route of Nanga Parbat on the Rupal Flank in 1983 with Tohokeiryo Kai Club friends. As he was leading a pitch up a chest deep snow face at around 7200m with Arai he fell 400 meters on top an avalanche along with seven Japanese colleagues nearly to the bottom of the face but barely survived as he stopped only 20m from the edge. One of the team members, Shimura, was swept down some 2000m to the bottom of the Rupal Face never to be found again. Sabir ended up with bruises all over his body and a sprained ankle while the team doctor Arai and Wakutsu had one broken arm each and the expedition leader Osamu Kunii survived with four broken ribs. Kunii also had a deep cut across his belly caused by the friction of the rope to such an extent that his intestines were exposed. The mountain took its toll and the expedition had to be abandoned.

In 1985 Sabir lured his old time friend and one of the most accomplished Himalayan climbers Doug Scott and his team to go on the same route of Nanga Parbat. Scott, his son Michael, Alastair Reid and Sabir free climbed to 7150m in a two-day push from Base Camp at 3600. Doug Scott got ill at the second bivouac around the same spot where they were swept with an avalanche in 1983 and had to abandon the climb.

==Death of brother==
In July 1980, Sabir lost his elder brother Inayat Shah, who served in the Pakistan Army Special Services Group (SSG). This was Shah&#x27;s second attempt on Diran on the SSG expedition. On their first trip in 1979 they had to return from merely 150 m from the summit due to Khalid Bashir who had developed pulmonary oedema and on the descent Bashir fell to his death. A year after they returned to look for the body of Khalid Bashir and also to take on Diran itself. He, along with the climbing leader Shaukat Nazir Hamdani and Rasheed, were buried under an ice avalanche while attempting Diran 7527m on this second Army SSG Expedition while waiting out a bad weather spell in Camp 3 thus ending the hopes of Sabir and his brother to climb Broad Peak the following year and many mountains together.

==Everest expeditions==
Nazir Sabir first attempted Everest leading the first Pakistan Everest Expedition of ten plus a film team led by Asad Qureshi who shot the film Everest Men Against Nature in 1997. Nazir had to abandon first summit attempt with his five colleagues due to strong blizzards blowing across the summit ridge from 8630m and again had to return from around 8500m on their two other summit attempts due to strong winds.
Nazir went back to Everest from Nepal side and on 17 May 2000, climbing in the company of his Nepalese Sherpa colleagues and a Canadian on a full moon night to avoid high winds he stepped on the highest summit at 0730 hours becoming the first from Pakistan to get to the roof of the world. After hoisting Pakistan flag atop Everest he paid tributes to his many dead friends on the higher ground of Everest including Scott Fischer, Rob Hall, Ube Akira, Kobayashi, Yasuo Kato, Futagami and many more who gave their lives in love of these eternal higher heavens. While waiting for Ben Webster of Canada and two other Sherpas he went on enjoying the most splendid moments of his life with his two Sherpa colleagues taking video shots of Ben and others climbing the last part of the summit ridge and the magical surroundings against the backdrop of the much blessed early morning sun approaching from behind 8462m Makalu, 5th highest mountain in the world.

He spoke to the base camp and sent the message of humbleness and happiness back home and to his closest friends who were watching his progress and counting steps up the last part of the mountain as he climbed through the clear night winds. He received hundreds of messages from across the country and the globe including that of Benazir Bhutto who was second to send in her congratulations from London where she lived at the time.

==Political career==
As a reward for years of services rendered to the people of Hunza, Sabir was elected as their representative to the Gilgit Baltistan Legislative Assembly in the October 1994 elections and was appointed Advisor on Education and Tourism to the then government for a five-year term. Campaigning for the Hunza seat in the 1994 elections he defeated his opponent from the traditional Mir of Hunza family with a huge margin taking away the public mandate as a commoner for the first time.

==Honors==
For his outstanding achievements he was awarded the prestigious Pride of Performance Award in 1982. and was honoured with The Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Excellence) in 2001 for his outstanding performance in mountaineering sports.

He is the only Pakistani to have been awarded honorary membership of the Alpine Club (UK) in 1992, the Polish Mountaineering Federation in 2002 and the American Alpine Club in 2008.

His home ground latest honour is when he was unanimously elected to the seat of the Alpine Club of Pakistan as its fifth but first civilian and mountaineer president after four army generals on 10 October 2004 and again elected for another term in 2007. Presently he heads the Alpine Club of Pakistan, which trains and prepares men and women from all around Pakistan for the outdoors activities and in particular mountain climbing.

==Environmentalist==
Sabir is currently working as an environmentalist on the conservation of wildlife in his native Hunza Valley and across Northern Pakistan including the Baltoro Glacier region. He is involved on the conservation of the 5000 years old world heritage of Juniper forests in Ziarat Balochistan in collaboration with Hayatullah Khan Durrani of Chiltan Adventurers Association Balochistan . He has also been raising voice on environmental matters in the Siachen Glacier region and across the Karakoram belt, opposing the Polo Tournaments at Shandur Pass and the Babusar Pass that is polluting the serene environment and is against the animal rights.

==Business career==

<doc id="985819" wikidata="Q1948902" url="?curid=985819" title="America's Sweetheart (album)">
<text>America&#x27;s Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love, released worldwide on February 10, 2004 by Virgin Records. Her first official release after her former band Hole&#x27;s break-up, the album&#x27;s sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole&#x27;s three previous studio albums: &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991), &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994) and &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998). The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles, California, however, was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love; including her drug problems, the disbandment of Hole, the controversy surrounding Nirvana&#x27;s upcoming box set, and legal problems with various record labels. In spring 2003, Love traveled to southern France to re-record the album, however, according to Love, she &quot;just wanted to be in a château for six months and do drugs.&quot; The album had three main producers, one of whom, James Barber, was Love&#x27;s partner at the time.

Following recording, &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; was further delayed due to Virgin&#x27;s insistence on multiple changes to the songs and artwork. Upon its release, it received little promotion, with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Mono,&quot; and Love&#x27;s highly publicized drug issues. &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure, selling 86,000 copies in its first three months, and with Love further citing the album as &quot;a mistake.&quot; In more recent years, both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as &quot;le disaster&quot; and &quot;ruined because [Love] was coked out,&quot; respectively. The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel, as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn.

== Background and history ==
Though the original recordings for &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; were made at a château in the south of France in 2003, the concept of Love&#x27;s first solo album was conceived as early as 2001, when rough versions of songs later to appear on &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; were being recorded. Critics who had heard the recordings referred to the tracks as &quot;her best recordings yet.&quot; Also around this time, Love began doing live performances, notably at both Ventura&#x27;s Majestic Theater and the Hollywood Bowl in October 2001, at which early versions of songs (such as &quot;But Julian, I&#x27;m A Little Bit Older Than You&quot; and &quot;All the Drugs&quot;) were performed.

The recording sessions for the album featured Love working with producer Linda Perry and lyricist Bernie Taupin, and amounted to a total of 32 songs, including a cover of &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; by Kim Carnes.

Non-US versions of the album feature – though uncredited – Brody Dalle and Kim Deal on a different recording of &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; (with slightly altered lyrics), singing and playing guitar. Dalle claims she is also a co-writer of the song. Despite being initially offended by the lack of credit, Dalle was happy to be uncredited due to the album&#x27;s subsequent mixed reception.

=== Record deal and controversy ===
In 2001, during rough recordings of the album, Love was rumoured to have been offered a deal by Interscope Records and the Universal Music Group that amounted to $18 million. However, recordings from the 2003 sessions were distributed to four different record labels after their completion. Although it seemed likely that Love was to sign with UK label Poptones, instead she signed to Virgin Records, who offered her a $20 million record deal. However, upon purchasing the album, Virgin demanded that the album be re-recorded so it would make their fiscal-year deadline of March 31. Love, who was in rehab for drug addiction at the time, was brought back and forth from her health center by Virgin Records and subsequently, her recovery from addiction did not improve and she became overwhelmed by compulsory work. Aside from it all, Love later revealed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that she &quot;never saw a penny&quot; from the advance that Virgin Records supposedly paid her for &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart.&quot;

Also, amidst the several controversies surrounding &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;&#x27;s release, Love accused Virgin Records of putting the final product out before it was finished. According to her, the record company chose the songs, the cover, the recorded vocals and the final arrangements without her participation: &quot;...I made five good songs. I had twelve songs, but they&#x27;re not on the album. I had no creative control.&quot; Furthermore, according to BMI and ASCAP&#x27;s websites, four of the songs on the album (&quot;But Julian I&#x27;m a Little Bit Older Than You&quot;, &quot;Almost Golden&quot; and both singles, &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;Hold on to Me&quot;) weren&#x27;t officially registered for copyright collect. By late 2006, the legal status of all of them seemed to have been corrected.

==Music and composition==
Love, on various occasions, has stated her disappointment with the album. She demonstrated her extreme regret about the record in a September 2006 interview:
&quot;The sound on &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; sucked beyond words. The production was a nightmare. Linda and I had written some really good songs, but they were rendered lazily and sound like shit. The art was horrific and not my idea and the label didn&#x27;t back it at all. I was busy taking drugs to dull the pain of having lost everything and made a shit album to boot [...] the producer didn&#x27;t know what he was doing and he just spent my money. It almost had a moment of being &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; – almost – but that&#x27;s like almost winning a race. You either do or you do not. And in this case it&#x27;s a delightfully written record in parts and sonically untenable with two of the most pretentious songs I have ever written. I was so druggy I thought it&#x27;d be cute to rip off &quot;(Smells Like) Teen Spirit&quot; on &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything.&quot; Believe it or not, &quot;All the Drugs&quot;, &quot;Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;But Julian...&quot; are all good songs. They just were produced crap and the songs weren&#x27;t taken further than demo status. The art still makes me seethe. At least make it look cool, and instead there&#x27;s me as a &quot;Playboy&quot; pinup. I love Olivia&#x27;s art but that was personal for me – not art for a record.&quot;

In the documentary &quot;The Return of Courtney Love&quot;, co-writer Linda Perry referred to &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; by saying &quot;a lot of heart went in to and it got ruined because her [Courtney] and her friend were coke&#x27;d out.&quot; In 2010, while addressing the Oxford Union, Love referred to the album as a &quot;really crap record&quot; and reasoned that drug issues were to blame for its content.

In 2004, before the final production and release of the album, Love asked ex-Hole drummer Samantha Maloney to travel to France after drummer Patty Schemel left the album&#x27;s recording sessions for a second time. After adding drum takes to the album, Maloney travelled back to the US and was put in charge of assembling Love&#x27;s live band, which later became known as The Chelsea. After auditions, Maloney reconnected with guitarist Radio Sloan, found guitarist Lisa Leveridge, bassist Dvin Kirakosian, and the four women formed the core of Love&#x27;s backing band. Violinist Emilie Autumn later joined the band.

== Commercial performance ==

&quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; is usually regarded as a commercial failure. In the US, the album debuted at number fifty-three on the Billboard 200, selling 33,000 copies. This figure was significantly lower than Love&#x27;s last album, Hole&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, which debuted at number nine. In its first three months, the album sold 86,000 copies, which was equivalent to &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;&#x27;s first week sales.

The first single taken from the album, &quot;Mono&quot;, was released in February 2004 and the song experienced some radio airplay, peaking at number 18 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number 41 in the UK. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hold on to Me&quot;, peaked at number 39 on the billboard Modern Rock Tracks, and was a minor hit in several countries.

==Reception==
Critical response to &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; was mixed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that &quot;since her solo debut is so sloppy and predictable [...] it suggests her music is more bluster than meaning&quot; and that &quot;[Love is] trying to snarl like it&#x27;s 1994, yet wrapping herself in a glossy production from 1998 while relying on songs that are an amalgam of bad L.A. punk and bad L.A. metal.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; also published a mixed review stating that the album &quot;sounds slight and rather ragged&quot; but &quot;never less than compelling&quot; and that &quot;the production covers everything in a superficial glosshile.&quot; Pitchfork Media reacted negatively to the album stating that &quot;&quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; demonstrates a fairly monstrous decline in both quality and conviction&quot; and that it was &quot;retaining all the dated grunge crunch.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Rob Sheffield suggested that, &quot;for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; should be more fun than an Osbournes marathon.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote positively of the record, believing Love had &quot;delivered an album as invigorating in its contempt for rock professionalism as Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; critic Charles Aaron was also impressed by the album, referring to it as a &quot;jaw-dropping act of artistic will&quot;, while Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted the lyrics as the strong point of the album calling them &quot;hedonistic to the last&quot; and &quot;some of the baldest ever recorded.&quot;

<doc id="985820" wikidata="Q41864" url="?curid=985820" title="Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye">
<text>Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye () or Sigurd Ragnarsson was a semi-legendary Viking warrior and Danish king active from the mid to late 9th century. According to multiple saga sources and Scandinavian histories from the 12th century and later, he is one of the sons of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok and Áslaug. His historical prototype might have been the Danish King Sigfred who ruled briefly in the 870s. Norwegian kings&#x27; genealogies of the Middle Ages name him as an ancestor of Harald Fairhair and used his mother&#x27;s supposed ancestry to Völsung in order to create an ancestry between Harald and his descendants and Odin.

==Early life==
&quot;Snake-in-the-eye&quot; as part of Sigurd&#x27;s name denoted a physical characteristic. He was born with a mark in his eye, described as the image of the ouroboros (a snake biting its own tail).

According to &quot;Ragnar Lothbrok&#x27;s saga&quot;, while Sigurd was just a boy, his half-brothers Eric and Agnar were killed by Swedish king Eysteinn Beli (also known as Östen). When Áslaug heard the news of Eric and Agnar&#x27;s death, even though she was not their mother, she cried blood and asked the other sons of Ragnar to avenge their dead brothers. Because the Swedish king controlled Uppsala and a holy cow named Sibilja, Ivar the Boneless believed gods were on Eysteinn&#x27;s side and feared the magic that ruled there. However, when his younger brother, the three-year-old Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, wanted to attack Eysteinn, the brothers changed their minds. Sigurd&#x27;s foster-father assembled five longships for him. Hvitserk and Björn Ironside mustered 14, and Aslaug and Ivar the Boneless marshaled 10 ships each, and together they took vengeance upon Eysteinn.

The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus relates that Sigurd, as a young man, was close to his father and sojourned for a time in Scotland and the Scottish Islands. After Ragnar&#x27;s Viking army had slain the local earls, Sigurd and his brother Radbard were appointed sub-rulers of these territories. Later in life Sigurd and his brothers accompanied Ragnar on a hazardous expedition through Rus&#x27; to the Hellespont.

==Death of Ragnar Lothbrok and the Great Heathen Army==
Most of the legendary sources say that King Ælla of Northumbria killed Ragnar Lothbrok, in about 865, by having him thrown into a pit of snakes. According to traditional accounts, Ragnar is reputed to have exclaimed as he was dying: &quot;How the young pigs would grunt if they knew what the old boar suffers!&quot; Sigurd and his siblings were reportedly informed of their father&#x27;s fate by an envoy from Ælla. As he heard the news, Sigurd was supposedly so affected that he cut himself to the bone with a knife he held in his hand; his brother Björn Ironside supposedly gripped a spear so tightly that the imprint of his fingers was left in the wood. Sigurd and his brothers swore they would avenge Ragnar&#x27;s death. 

In 865–866, the Viking leaders Ivar the Boneless and Ubbe crossed the North Sea with a &quot;stor hær&quot; (&quot;Great Army&quot;). Traditional accounts claim that all the surviving sons of Ragnar apart from Ivar launched a first attack on Ælla&#x27;s kingdom, which failed. Sigurd&#x27;s brother, Ivar the Boneless, devised a strategy in which the Great Heathen Army occupied and sacked York, to provoke Ælla into engaging on the Vikings&#x27; terms. Under Ivar&#x27;s plan, the Vikings feigned retreat, leading Ælla to underestimate them and become encircled. According to &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot;, part of the &quot;Sagas of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot;), Ælla was captured alive and executed afterwards by blood eagle.

==Sigurd&#x27;s descendants==
&quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; states that when his father died, Sigurd inherited Zealand, Scania, Halland, the Danish islands, and Viken. It is also possible he was for a time co-ruler of Denmark with his brother Halfdan, because Frankish sources mention certain Sigfred and Halfdan as rulers in 873 – the names Sigurd and Sigfred were often mixed up in Nordic literature. He could have succeeded his brother Halfdan Ragnarsson as the sole king of Denmark in about 877, when Halfdan fell in battle in the Irish Sea. A Danish Viking king called Sigfred, who appears to have become landless by this time, was killed in West Francia in 887; he is quite possibly the same person. Sigurd married Blaeja, the daughter of king Ælla of Northumbria and they had two children, Harthacanute and Áslaug Sigurðardóttir, who was married to Helge of the Dagling lineage.

Helge may have briefly succeeded his purported father-in-law as king of Denmark before being overthrown by Olof, a Viking chief who swept down from Sweden in about the year 900.

The &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; states that Danish king Harthacanute was a son of Sigurd. However, the 11th century chronicler Adam of Bremen mentions Hardegon (probably Harthacanute) as the son of a certain Sven. Hardegon or Harthacanute succeeded Sigtrygg Gnupasson as the king of part of Denmark (probably Jutland, but according to later tradition Zealand, Scania and Halland) in about 916. According to the &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;, he nevertheless lost Viken (Oslofjord) that had been part of the Danish realm in the 9th century. He was the father of Gorm the Old, the king of Denmark. Gorm succeeded his father as king and married Thyra.

Gorm&#x27;s son, Harald Bluetooth succeeded his father as king and married possibly three times with Gunhild, Tove and Gyrid. Harald had a son named Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn succeeded his father as king and married Gunhild (Świętosława of Poland). They had a son named Cnut the Great. Sweyn also ruled England in his lifetime and established the Danish Empire. When Sweyn died, his elder son Harald Svendsen became the king of Denmark, while England&#x27;s former king, Ethelred, reclaimed the throne. Following Harald&#x27;s death, his brother Cnut the Great became king, re-established the Danish North Sea Empire. He married Emma of Normandy with whom he had a son named Harthacnut. When Cnut died (and after the brothers of Harthacnut also had died), Harthacnut became king of Denmark and England. Upon his death, Edward the Confessor became ruler of England in 1042. Sweyn Forkbeard also had a daughter, Estrid, from whom all ruling kings and queens of Denmark after 1047 descend.

Sigurd&#x27;s daughter Áslaug, as mentioned above, married Helgi the Sharp of the Dagling dynasty. They had a son named Sigurd Hart, who married a woman named Ingeborg. Sigurd Hart and Ingeborg had children named Guttorm Sigurdsson and Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter. When Sigurd Hart&#x27;s uncle, king Fróði of Ringerike died, Sigurd Hart supposedly went to Norway to succeed him as king of Ringerike.

<text>Edinburgh Rugby (formerly Edinburgh Reivers, Edinburgh Gunners) is one of the two professional rugby union teams from Scotland. The club competes in the United Rugby Championship, along with the Glasgow Warriors, its oldest rival. Edinburgh plays the majority of its home games at Edinburgh Rugby Stadium.

The original Edinburgh District team played the first ever inter-district match against Glasgow District in 1872, winning the match 3–0.

The amateur district team was reformed with professionalism, as Edinburgh Rugby, in 1996 to compete in the Heineken Cup, its best performance coming in the 2011–12 season, when the club reached the semi-final but lost out narrowly to Ulster, 22–19. The quarter-final tie against Toulouse attracted a former club record crowd of 37,881 spectators to Murrayfield. As of 2025, the attendance record stands at 40,063, achieved against Glasgow Warriors in 2024. In 2003–04 Edinburgh became the first Scottish team to reach the quarter-finals.

In the 2014–15 season, Edinburgh became the first Scottish club to reach a major European final, when they met Gloucester Rugby in the European Rugby Challenge Cup showpiece at Twickenham Stoop in London.

==History==
Edinburgh District played in the world&#x27;s first ever inter-district match, against Glasgow District, in 1872.

For the history of the District prior to professionalism, see: 

===Professional era establishment: 1996===
Following the introduction of professional rugby in 1995, the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) considered that Scottish club sides would not be able to compete against the best teams from France and England. The SRU therefore decided that the four district teams were to be Scotland&#x27;s vehicle for professional rugby and in 1996 the Edinburgh District team was reformed as Edinburgh Rugby to compete in the Heineken Cup. Because of the SRU&#x27;s significant debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield Stadium, further reorganisation soon became necessary and the four professional sides were reduced to two. After two seasons as Edinburgh Rugby, the club was subsequently merged with Border Reivers to form a new team known as Edinburgh Reivers.

For the 1999 and 2000 seasons the Scottish Rugby Union and Welsh Rugby Union joined forces, with the expansion of the Welsh Premier Division to include Edinburgh Reivers and Glasgow Caledonians, under the name Welsh-Scottish League. However, further change was imminent and in 2001 an agreement was made between the Irish Rugby Football Union, Scottish Rugby Union and Welsh Rugby Union to create a new competition which would bring in the four Irish provinces. 2001 saw the first incarnation of the Celtic League. In that inaugural season Edinburgh finished in sixth place.

The following season, to coincide with the re-establishment of the Border Reivers, a Scottish League competition modelled on the Tri-Nations was introduced alongside the Celtic League, however this survived for only a single season, Edinburgh becoming the only champions.

Following the reduction of Scotland&#x27;s professional structure from four to two sides, a further rebranding took place. The Edinburgh Reivers name was replaced by Edinburgh Rugby, with the Glasgow Caledonians undergoing a similar renaming process, as part of a &quot;major revamp&quot; of the professional structure in Scotland.

In the 2003–04 season the team found some success, when it reached the Final of the inaugural Celtic Cup, beating Cardiff Blues and Connacht en route in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. The team&#x27;s good run came to an end in the Final, however, with a 21–27 loss to Ulster, at Murrayfield. David Humphreys kicked 17 points in the match to earn the Irish province the trophy

For the 2005–06 season, the Edinburgh team found itself looking for a new coach after the departure of Frank Hadden to coach Scotland. Sean Lineen, then Glasgow Warriors assistant coach, was linked with the post before Todd Blackadder acquired the position for the season after a spell as interim coach. During the same season the team nickname was incorporated into the official name, which became the Edinburgh Gunners. The &quot;Gunners&quot; moniker was dropped on 29 September 2006, after the club had become Scottish rugby&#x27;s first private franchise during the summer. The team name reverted to Edinburgh Rugby. One reason for the change was that the name &quot;The Gunners&quot; was already a registered Trademark of Arsenal Football Club. Another reason was the wish of the new owners for a re-branding, including a different name and the introduction of a new logo. Despite this, the name &quot;The Gunners&quot; is still used informally by some long-standing fans.

===Private ownership: 2006–07===

====Scotland&#x27;s first private franchise: 2006====

In 2006, it was announced that from the end of the 2005–06 season, Edinburgh would become a franchise. Finance would come from a private company headed by businessmen Alex and Bob Carruthers. This was thought to be a saving grace for Border Reivers. The team was thought to be the favourite to be folded, after the Scottish Rugby Union warned that funding problems could force it to scrap one of its Celtic League sides. The SRU was to retain a seat on the new company board and continue to provide development funding and support to the new owners. Following the departure of Todd Blackadder to join the Crusaders coaching setup in Super Rugby, Lynn Howells was appointed as head coach by Edinburgh&#x27;s new executive chairman, Alex Carruthers.

====Funding dispute and return to SRU: 2007====
In July 2007, a dispute arose between the Scottish Rugby Union and the owners of the newly franchised Edinburgh team. According to owner Bob Carruthers the SRU owed Edinburgh a six-figure sum which, he said, had not been paid. Carruthers also claimed that SRU had threatened to withdraw funding should Edinburgh continue with legal action relating to the sum. During the dispute, Alex Carruthers resigned along with then managing director Graeme Stirling. The dispute caused much disruption in Scottish rugby at the time, leading to the temporary withdrawal of 12 players from the Scotland squad training for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. This included leading players such as Chris Paterson and Mike Blair

The dispute escalated when, on 9 July 2007, Edinburgh revoked its associate membership of the SRU. This led to doubts about Edinburgh Rugby&#x27;s ability to fulfil fixtures in the Celtic League and Heineken Cup and, whether or not Edinburgh players were insured for playing at club level. The resignation was withdrawn on 12 July, with Bob Carruthers being quoted as asking to &quot;talk directly to someone&quot; and insisting that the proposed signing of Australia stand-off Stephen Larkham would go ahead.
Despite this, the dispute continued, with each party initiating legal action against the other. The situation was resolved in August 2007, with the termination of the franchise agreement and the return of Edinburgh to the direct control of the SRU.

===Under Andy Robinson: 2007–2009===

Following the return to SRU control, the club coach Lynn Howells was dismissed. The SRU&#x27;s Head of Player Development was appointed interim coach and Nic Cartwright was appointed as chief executive. Former British &amp; Irish Lions captain Gavin Hastings was subsequently appointed as chairman, stating his &quot;desire and passion to see this game and this club grow&quot;. The proposed signing of Stephen Larkham fell through after the SRU was unable to honour the terms of the agreement. This was seen as a disappointment, because the signing had been considered a coup for the beleaguered SRU when it was initially announced.

Following an application process, it was announced on 1 October 2007 that Andy Robinson, the former England head coach, would become the club&#x27;s new head coach. Edinburgh showed progress under Robinson and performed well at home in the Heineken Cup, posting wins against Leinster and Leicester Tigers and a narrow loss to Toulouse, earning a bonus point. Following disappointing performances by Scotland in the 6 Nations, and Robinson co-coaching Scotland A, there were rumours of Robinson taking a post within the Scotland set-up after helping Edinburgh to climb to 3rd in the Celtic League.
This progress, however, was counter-pointed by some disappointing results including being shut out by Cardiff Blues at Murrayfield and losing the 1872 Challenge Cup on aggregate to rivals Glasgow Warriors.

On 26 December 2008, a new home record attendance of 12,534 saw the game against Glasgow Warriors. In the 2008–09 season Edinburgh reached their highest position finishing in second place behind Munster.

Andy Robinson left in 2009 to take up the position of head coach of the Scottish national side. Rob Moffat took over at Edinburgh. Michael Bradley was the new manager from 2011 to 2012.

===Under Michael Bradley: 2011–2013===

Michael Bradley took over in May 2011 on a two-year contract.

The 2011–12 season saw the introduction of several young players into the squad including début seasons for 21-year-olds Matt Scott and Grant Gilchrist, 19-year-old Harry Leonard and first full seasons for back three players Tom Brown and Lee Jones plus the back row pair Stuart McInally and David Denton. Most of these players would become regular starters for the club and Jones, Brown, Scott, Gilchrist, McInally and Denton were destined for international honours. Domestically the season was not a success, with only 6 league wins out of 22 games, but the 2011–12 Heineken Cup campaign proved to be the most successful in the club&#x27;s history when it topped Pool 2, including a remarkable home victory against Racing Métro by 48–47 - the largest Heineken Cup comeback in the league&#x27;s history, having been losing 27–47 with just over ten minutes remaining - and setting up a quarter final against French rugby giants Toulouse by scoring four tries, and therefore a bonus point, against London Irish. The game against Toulouse in April 2012, was played before a new club record crowd of 37,881 and was closely contested, with Edinburgh holding out for a 19–14 win thanks to an early try from Mike Blair and penalties from captain Greig Laidlaw, setting up a semi-final in Dublin against Ulster. The semi-final was a close match but Ulster triumphed 22–19.

The 2012–13 season started with much expectation after the strengthening of the squad through the additions of W. P. Nel, John Yapp, Richie Rees, Dimitri Basilaia, Ben Atiga, Greig Tonks, Izak van der Westhuizen, and Andy Titterrell. These arrivals were however tempered by the loss of several experienced internationals, Mike Blair, Chris Paterson, Jim Thompson, Alan MacDonald, Esteban Lozada and Phil Godman among them. However, after another poor start to the Pro12 League, Edinburgh were then beaten 0–45 by Saracens at Murrayfield in the first round of Heineken Cup matches. This was followed by another high-scoring defeat when the team lost 33–0 to Munster Rugby at Thomond Park.

Following increasingly disappointing results and performances in the Pro12 league it was announced in February 2013 that Edinburgh would not be renewing Bradley&#x27;s contract at the end of the season along with defence coach Billy McGinty. McGinty chose to leave his position with immediate effect with Bradley overseeing the defence until the end of the season. However, in a surprise move just a month later on 6 March 2013 Edinburgh announced that both Bradley and forwards coach Neil Back were being removed with immediate effect and coaches Stevie Scott and Duncan Hodge would take over until the end of the season.

In his final year to early March 2013 the Club lost all six matches in the Heineken Cup and recorded four league victories all season in the Pro12 against Cardiff, Zebre, Connacht and Ospreys. Edinburgh Rugby accumulated seven losing bonus points in this period highlighting the need for minor adjustments to change the sides fortunes on the pitch.

In the remaining five matches on the season Edinburgh won three, recording victories against Ulster, Zebre and Gwent Dragons to finish the season in 10th place in the Pro12 one place higher than the 2011–12 season.

===Under Alan Solomons: 2013–2016===

Alan Solomons, formerly the coach of Western Province, Stormers, Ulster and more recently Super Rugby team the Kings, was appointed as head coach at the end of July 2013. Stevie Scott and Omar Mouneimne were appointed as assistant coaches.

Solomons&#x27; first season at the club was treated largely as a rebuilding period, with several players departing and replacements coming in. The league campaign culminated in an eighth-place finish.

2014–15 saw Edinburgh again finishing eighth, albeit with ten points and three victories more than the previous season. While the pre-season target of a top six finish wasn&#x27;t achieved, there were other reasons to consider the campaign a success. The first came over the festive period when the team beat Glasgow Warriors over two legs to win the inter-city 1872 Cup for the first time in six seasons. After going down 16–6 in the first encounter at Scotstoun Stadium, the Murrayfield men turned the tables with a 20–8 victory in the return leg, with Tim Visser notching two first-half tries, to bring the trophy back to the capital for the first time since 2009. As the season reached its final stages, Edinburgh&#x27;s excellent European form took them to within touching distance of more silverware.

Solomons left the club in September 2016 following a poor start to the season. Assistant coach Duncan Hodge was placed in temporary charge, and ultimately held the reins for the remainder of the campaign.

====2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup====
By finishing top of their European Rugby Challenge Cup group (containing the French Top 14 pair Lyon and Bordeaux as well as English Premiership team London Welsh) they progressed to the knockout stage, where they were seeded fifth. They went on to beat fourth seed London Irish 18–23 in the quarter finals at the Madejski Stadium. In the semi-finals they thrashed the Newport Gwent Dragons an impressive 45–16 in front of a home crowd of over 8,000 at Murrayfield, making them the first Scottish team to ever reach a European final. They faced Gloucester in the final at the Twickenham Stoop on 2 May, losing 19–13.

===Under Richard Cockerill: 2017–2021===
In February 2017, the club announced the appointment of former Leicester Tigers and Toulon Head Coach Richard Cockerill for the following season. Cockerill led the team to the play-offs of the 2017–18 Pro14 season, the first time the club have qualified for the end-of-season series since its introduction. Their season ended following a tight away defeat to Munster.

During his tenure, several Edinburgh players have made their international debuts for Scotland, including props Simon Berghan, Darryl Marfo and Murray McCallum, lock Lewis Carmichael, wing Darcy Graham, full-back Blair Kinghorn, hooker Dave Cherry, flankers Luke Hamilton and Jamie Ritchie, and former Edinburgh players Phil Burleigh, Cornell du Preez and George Turner, flanker Luke Crosbie, centres Chris Dean and James Johnstone, and scrum-halves Nathan Fowles, Sean Kennedy and Charlie Shiel were named in Scotland squads.

In addition, wing Duhan van der Merwe, prop Rory Sutherland, and flanker Hamish Watson have all toured with the British &amp; Irish Lions in South Africa, with each one becoming a Test Lion in the first test match of the series, a 17–22 win for the Lions against the Springboks. However, in July 2021, Cockerill left Edinburgh by mutual consent. Former Scotland captain and Lions scrum-half Mike Blair has been appointed as the head coach for the 2021–22 season, Edinburgh&#x27;s first in the new United Rugby Championship.

===Under Mike Blair: 2021–2023===

Following a frustrating season, Edinburgh announced the immediate departure of head coach Richard Cockerill by &quot;mutual consent&quot; in July 2021 with Mike Blair (who was at the time part of the Scotland International set up) announced as the new head coach later that month. Blair&#x27;s appointment coincided with new signings including Scotland international James Lang, South African Henry Immelman and Argentine utility back Emiliano Boffelli. Blair&#x27;s appointment also saw the departure of longtime attack coach Duncan Hodge.

Blair&#x27;s first game in charge was a 10-26 pre-season friendly loss to Newcastle Falcons; their first game in the new Edinburgh Rugby Stadium (since renamed the DAM Health Stadium, and then the Hive, for sponsorship reasons). Edinburgh made a good start to their first United Rugby Championship campaign and also the European Challenge Cup, where they beat Saracens 18–21 away in the first round.

In February 2023, Blair announced he would step down as head coach at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season

===Under Sean Everitt: 2023–===

Sean Everitt was recruited in July 2023 as a &#x27;Senior Coach&#x27; to replace Blair for the 2023/24 season. This season saw modest results for the club, taking 11 wins, notably being the only team to emerge from Ulster&#x27;s home stadium victorius. However, the team were crucially let down by only collecting five bonus points throughout the season, ultimately leading to them finishing tenth in the league, below Lions and Ospreys, despite having more wins than them.

Everitt signed a 2-year extension at the beginning of 2024 to remain at the club until June 2026 becoming Head Coach in the process.

As of the half-way point in the 2024–25 season, Edinburgh sit eighth in the URC table, with four wins from eight, all at home - but having already surpassed their bonus point total from the 2023–24 season. They sit top of Pool 3 in the Challenge Cup on points difference, with a loss away to Gloucester, and a win at home to Bayonne.

===Stadia===

Edinburgh Rugby have played at a number of grounds over the years including Meadowbank Stadium, Meggetland Sports Complex and most recently Myreside. It was recognised over the years by fans and players alike that Edinburgh have lacked a true Home Ground with BT Murrayfield often criticised for providing a poor atmosphere due to being largely empty for most games.

On 31 May 2018, Edinburgh Rugby announced a new proposed 7,800-seater Edinburgh Rugby Stadium to be built on the training pitches at Murrayfield. The stadium cost Scottish Rugby an estimated £5 million. The stadium was completed on 16 February 2021.

==Women&#x27;s team==

<text>Uelen is a rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) in Chukotsky District, just south of the Arctic Circle in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 720. Located near Cape Dezhnev where the Bering Sea meets the Chukchi Sea, it is the easternmost settlement in Russia and the whole of Asia. It is located in the Western Hemisphere, but the International Date Line curves around it, so it remains in a Russian time zone (UTC+12:00). Uelen is also the closest Asian settlement to North America. It is on the northeast corner of the Uelen Lagoon, a roughly east-west lagoon separated from the ocean by a sandspit. Municipally, Uelen is subordinated to Chukotsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Uelen Rural Settlement.

==History==
===Origins of name===
There are a number of competing ideas as to the origin of the name of the village. The name Uelen is thought by some sources to derive from the Chukchi &quot;&quot;uvelen&quot; meaning &quot;black, thawed patch&quot;&quot;, since the village is found at the foot of a hill surrounded by black mounds which are visible throughout the year and were often used as a navigation aid in the region.

There is a local legend which offers a second explanation for the origin of the name. It describes the life of a strong local man called Uvelel&#x27;yn (literally translated as &quot;slob&quot;), named so because he was an orphan who was dressed solely in tattered rags. As he grew older, he used his strength to gain his revenge over the local people that bullied him during his childhood because of his background. In fear for their lives, the villagers killed Uvelel&#x27;yn. However they realised that in order to prevent these events repeating themselves in the future, they should take better care of their orphans and the village soon got its name to remind the villagers of their duty to those less fortunate than themselves.

Prior to being named Uelen, the village was called Ulyk (, Olyk in Yupik and Pok’ytkyn in Chukchi), meaning &quot;land&#x27;s end&quot; and &quot;flooded place&quot; respectively.

The first mention of the name Uelen appears on a map from the Billings-Sarychev expedition from 1792.

===Prehistory===
Archeological investigation has revealed the existence of a settlement in and around the present day site of the village about from the village for at least 2000 years, based on fishing and the hunting of marine mammals. The main site of archeological investigation is at the Ekven site, a site of importance comparable to that of the Ipiutak site across the Bering Strait on Point Hope.

===Pre-Soviet===

Prior to the Russian Revolution, Uelen was, in 1912, a settlement of around 300 individuals divided into four communes and the headquarters of the Russian administration in the Chukotka Region (&quot;Uyezd&quot;) and was an important trading port with both local Russian people and America.

===Soviet Union===
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Uelen became one of the first trade co-operatives in Chukotka and a dedicated American trading post was established. The first school in Chukotka was established in Uelen in 1916.

In the first half of the twentieth century, Uelen was the site of one of the first Russian arctic research stations.

In the 1950s, Uelen became a focal point in the region, along with Lavrentiya, Lorino and Inchoun (see diagram) for the relocation of indigenous peoples following the decision to close a large number of uneconomical villages. Uelen absorbed the population from the nearby village of Dezhnevo (named, like the neighbouring cape, after the explorer Semyon Dezhnev). This village, to the west of Cape Peek and called Keniskun by the local Chukchi was an important regional coastal trading centre in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but was deemed unviable by the Soviet government and the villagers were moved to Uelen. The addition of Dezhnevo carvers to the existing artistic school in Uelen served to strengthen Uelen&#x27;s cultural reputation not just in the region but across Russia with notable carvers such as Pyotr Penkok and Stepan Ettugi working in Uelen. In addition to absorbing the population of Dezhnevo, Uelen also absorbed the part of the population of the former village of Naukan, which itself had absorbed the population of a number of small villages from the Cape Dezhnev/Diomede Islands area.

===Post-Soviet===


Although Dezhnevo was officially abolished, the villagers in Uelen still use it as a base for their fishing and a handful of houses are still maintained for this purpose. As well as a fishing base, the site of the village is still used as an occasional port by Uelen. At the end of summer, storms in the Chukchi Sea can make it impossible for ships to dock at Uelen to unload their supplies. When this occurs, the ships dock at Dezhnevo and the cargo is carried across land to Uelen.

In more recent history, Uelen is where Dimitri Kieffer and Karl Bushby entered Russia during their Goliath Expedition after crossing the Bering Strait. The two were then arrested because they had failed to enter the country at a proper port of entry, but their journey was allowed to continue.

==Demographics==
The population according to the most recent census results was 740, of whom 368 were male and 352 female. Uelen had a population of 740 at the start of 2009, down from 776 in 2003 (with 595 Chukchi and 72 Yupik.) Other villagers are Russian.

==Culture==
The village is famous for its walrus ivory carvings. It has long been a major artistic centre in the region, with Several of the leading exponents of the craft, such as Vukvutagin, Vukvol, Tukkai and Khukhutan working out of Uelen. The Uelen Bone Carving Studio () contains the world&#x27;s only museum of Walrus ivory carving. In 2004, a successful exhibition of their work was held in Bern, Switzerland and carvers from Uelen took first place in the category &quot;Russian hunt: Tradition and Modernity&quot; at the third Moscow Exhibition of Russian Crafts.

It is also home to an indigenous choir which has a history of cultural collaboration with Inuit across the Bering Strait in Alaska.

The writer Yuri Rytkheu was born in Uelen on March 8, 1930, to a family of trappers and hunters. He was the first Chukchi author to achieve national prominence. His book &quot;A Dream in Polar Fog&quot; deals with the Chukchi people&#x27;s efforts to adapt when a foreigner is shipwrecked on their shores.

The village also serves as a base for archaeology expeditions to the area, which have uncovered a burial ground containing more than 300 burials of Early Whale Hunter cultures, covering a time span from 500 BCE to 1000 CE.These excavations have shown that Uelen was a major settlement in the area in the first few centuries CE, as well as revealing the existence of a culture dependent on whale and walrus hunting, archeologists have also unearthed early examples of the indigenous peoples ivory carvings, a number of which are now held at the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St. Petersburg.

==Transport==
Uelen is not connected by road to any other part of the world and is 100 km from the district centre, Lavrentiya. However, there is a small network of roads in the village including:

* Улица Дежнева (Ulitsa Dezhneva, lit. &quot;Dezhnyov Street&quot;)
* Улица Ленина (Ulitsa Lenina, lit. &quot;Lenin Street&quot;)
* Улица Набережная (Ulitsa Naberezhnaya, lit. &quot;Quay Street&quot;)
==Climate==
Uelen has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Chukotsky district endures extreme Arctic weather, with an average winter low of in January, though Uelen&#x27;s average January temperature is slightly higher at . February is the coldest month. The average July temperature is slightly higher at than the district average for the month of , and the overall annual average of is also higher than the district average of . Snow storms in the winter from the north cause harsh frosts and drifting snow, whilst southerly blizzards bring large snowfalls and sudden thaws. The area is also very windy, reaching annually and every two decades. Spring weather is a little milder than winter weather if still below freezing. Due to the position of Uelen by the sea coast there are also many instances of fog and mist per year with the result that sunshine hours are very low especially when the adjacent ocean begins to thaw. The record high is on July 16, 1960, and the record low is on January 29, 1989.

<doc id="985828" wikidata="Q4532140" url="?curid=985828" title="The Dune Encyclopedia">
<text>The Dune Encyclopedia is a 1984 collection of essays written by Willis E. McNelly and multiple other contributors as a companion to Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series of science fiction novels.

==Overview==
&quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot;, written by McNelly and 42 other contributors as a companion to the &quot;Dune&quot; series, was published in paperback in 1984. It describes in great detail many aspects of the &quot;Dune&quot; universe not covered in the novels themselves, such as character biographies and explanations of key elements, including planets, factions like the Bene Gesserit and Mentats, the spice melange, and technology such as heighliners and stillsuits.

==Publication==
&quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; was published by Berkley Books, an imprint of Putnam, the publisher of all of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; novels. The cover called the work &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;authorized&quot;. Additionally, Frank Herbert approved the book, considering it &quot;amusing&quot; and &quot;fascinating&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was compiled and published between &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981) and &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984), and Herbert &quot;read large portions of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, then in the final stages, to McNelly during the compiling of the volume so that McNelly could keep abreast of developments.&quot; Herbert himself wrote the foreword for the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; (dated November 1983), which noted:

&quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; is written as an encyclopedia published within the &quot;Dune&quot; universe itself, edited by &quot;Hadi Benotto&quot;, a fictional archaeologist mentioned by Frank Herbert in his novels &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; and &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. Rather than claiming to contain absolute fact about this universe, the introduction by Benotto notes that &quot;readers of &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; should understand its limitations: it is not designed as a definitive study of the entire eras encompassed by the Atreides Imperium&quot; and that a portion of the (fictional) source material is shaped by the interests and influences of the God Emperor Leto II.

In 1999, McNelly stated that he had proposed to Frank Herbert that they collaborate on a &quot;Dune&quot; prequel novel, expanding upon the Butlerian Jihad story presented in &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot;. He noted, &quot;FH and I had discussed writing it together and he agreed with my general plot outline, completed first chapter, and so on but his untimely death prevented us from continuing.&quot;

Beginning in 1999, a series of &quot;Dune&quot; prequel novels have been written by Frank Herbert&#x27;s son Brian Herbert and novelist Kevin J. Anderson. &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; was subsequently declared non-canon on the official &quot;Dune&quot; website in a letter credited to Brian Herbert, Anderson and McNelly:
==Contributors==
Entries in the encyclopedia were written by multiple contributors: Joan Bouchelle, Edgar L. Chapman, Judith A. Clark, Michael Clayton, Grace W. Eckley, Greta Eisner, Peter Facione, J.L. Germain, J.H. Gervais, Stephen Goldman, Lee Granell, Jane Hipolito, William Hornaday, Wesley D. Ives, Edward M. Jennings, Alan Kaye, Dorothy Kilker, Gillian Kitrick, Linda R. Levy, Gregory Lichtenberg, Victoria Lustbader, Michael W. McClintock, Willis McNelly, Douglas J. McReynolds, Walter E. Meyers, Frederic H. Miler, Myron Orleans, Charles A. Povlovich, John Quijada, Julia Reed, R. Reginald, Thomas E. Roberts, John A. Ryan, Roger Schlobin, Maureen A. Shifflett, Ray C. Shifflett, Joyce Tally, Stephen Tobias, Michael Tolley, Robert Trowbridge, John A. Turner, Christine Watson, and Carl B. Yoke. Matt Howarth created the illustrations appearing in many of the entries. 

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Dune Encyclopaedia&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #61, and stated that &quot;The production is quite impressive, though real or faked photos instead of line-drawings would have added greatly to the &#x27;encyclopaedia&#x27; look. Whether it&#x27;s of interest to mere readers is debatable, but game-players and trivia hounds will be fascinated.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated, &quot;Unlike existing reader&#x27;s guides to the worlds of Tolkien and others, &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; is itself a work of fiction, rich in imaginary footnotes and learned sources, and &#x27;newly discovered information&#x27;. Herbert himself is (of course) delighted, but promises &#x27;Issues still to be explored as the Chronicles unfold&#x27;. Where will it end?&quot;

The work also received additional reviews:

<doc id="985834" wikidata="Q2576337" url="?curid=985834" title="Ostrich">
<text>Ostriches are large flightless birds. Two living species are recognised, the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa.

They are the heaviest and largest living birds, with adult common ostriches weighing anywhere between 63.5 and 145 kilograms and laying the largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at 70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, with significant industries in the Philippines and in Namibia. South Africa produces about 70% of global ostrich products, with the industry largely centered around the town of Oudtshoorn. Ostrich leather is a lucrative commodity, and the large feathers are used as plumes for the decoration of ceremonial headgear. Ostrich eggs and meat have been used by humans for millennia. Ostrich oil is another product that is made using ostrich fat. 

Ostriches are of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, cassowaries, kiwis and the extinct elephant birds and moas.

The common ostrich was historically native to the Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as China and Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene and possibly into the Holocene.
==Taxonomic history==
The genus &quot;Struthio&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus was used by Linnaeus and other early taxonomists to include the emu, rhea, and cassowary, until they each were placed in their own genera. The Somali ostrich (&quot;Struthio molybdophanes&quot;) has recently become recognized as a separate species by most authorities, while others are still reviewing the evidence.

==Evolution==
Struthionidae is a member of the Struthioniformes, a group of paleognath birds which first appeared during the Early Eocene, and includes a variety of flightless forms which were present across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia and North America) during the Eocene epoch. The closest relatives of Struthionidae within the Struthioniformes are the Ergilornithidae, known from the late Eocene to early Pliocene of Asia. It is therefore most likely that Struthionidae originated in Asia.

The earliest fossils of the genus &quot;Struthio&quot; are from the early Miocene ~21 million years ago of Namibia in Africa, so it is proposed that genus is of African origin. By the middle to late Miocene (5–13 mya) they had spread to and become widespread across Eurasia. While the relationship of the African fossil species is comparatively straightforward, many Asian species of ostrich have been described from fragmentary remains, and their interrelationships and how they relate to the African ostriches are confusing. In India, Mongolia and China, ostriches are known to have become extinct only around, or even after, the end of the last ice age; images of ostriches have been found prehistoric Chinese pottery and petroglyphs.

==Distribution and habitat ==
Today, ostriches are only found natively in the wild in Africa, where they occur in a range of open arid and semi-arid habitats such as savannas and the Sahel, both north and south of the equatorial forest zone. The Somali ostrich occurs in the Horn of Africa, having evolved isolated from the common ostrich by the geographic barrier of the East African Rift. In some areas, the common ostrich&#x27;s Masai subspecies occurs alongside the Somali ostrich, but they are kept from interbreeding by behavioral and ecological differences. The Arabian ostriches in Asia Minor and Arabia were hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th century, and in Israel attempts to introduce North African ostriches to fill their ecological role have failed. Escaped common ostriches in Australia have established populations.

==Species==
In 2008, &quot;S. linxiaensis&quot; was transferred to the genus &quot;Orientornis.&quot; Three additional species, &quot;S. pannonicus&quot;, &quot;S. dmanisensis&quot;, and &quot;S. transcaucasicus&quot;, were transferred to the genus &quot;Pachystruthio&quot; in 2019. Several additional fossil forms are ichnotaxa (that is, classified according to the organism&#x27;s trace fossils such as footprints rather than its body) and their association with those described from distinctive bones is contentious and in need of revision pending more good material.

The species are:

<text>Glasgow Warriors are a professional rugby union side from Scotland. The team plays in the United Rugby Championship league and in the European Professional Club Rugby tournaments. In the 2014–15 season they won the Pro12 title and became the first Scottish team to win a major trophy in rugby union&#x27;s professional era. In 2023-24 they became the first Scottish side to win the United Rugby Championship in its current form. The side is known for its fast, dynamic and attacking style of play, using offloads and quick rucks. Defensively the club prides itself on its &#x27;Fortress Scotstoun&#x27; where the club play at home.

==History==

Glasgow Warriors are a continuation of the amateur Glasgow District side founded in 1872.

For the history of Glasgow as an amateur district side see:
Reshaped as a professional club in 1996, Glasgow Warriors were originally known as Glasgow Rugby before rebranding as Glasgow Caledonians in 1998 by a merger with the Caledonian Reds. They dropped the Caledonians to become Glasgow Rugby in 2001 again and finally rebranded as the Glasgow Warriors in 2005.

===Origins: District Sides===

Scotland had four District Sides:- North and Midlands; South; Glasgow District and Edinburgh District. Glasgow and Edinburgh were formed in 1872 and played the world&#x27;s first ever inter-district match on 23 November of that year. This was known as the &#x27;Inter-City&#x27; derby; originally a twice a season event until 1876, then became annual thereafter.

The district sides capped the best amateur players from their area&#x27;s club sides to play inter-district matches and matches against touring sides. The Scottish Inter-District Championship began in 1953-54 (and so encompassed the traditional Inter-City derby). Unlike the Scottish clubs (and Ireland&#x27;s provincial sides), the Scottish district sides had no settled home and were not members of their Rugby Union. This meant when Scottish rugby embraced professionalism it was not clear if a model based on districts or clubs would be used.

====Professional model: Club or District debate====

It was not clear which route professionalism would go in Scotland. This created a turbulent start for professionalism in Scotland and left Scotland far behind fast-embracing Ireland in the set up of its professional structure. The first season of the Heineken Cup in 1995–96 was run without any Scottish teams in European competition.

An EGM was held by the SRU for its member clubs to debate the matter and try and settle the issue on 8 February 1996. The SRU management was in favour of districts and its Vice-president Fred McLeod, and Jim Telfer argued for the proposal. In favour of the clubs to be represented in Europe were former Scotland internationalists Gavin Hastings and Keith Robertson. Critically a speech from the floor from Brian Simmers of Glasgow Academicals – arguing that Hastings and Robertson didn&#x27;t have the best interests of Scottish rugby at heart and they were arguing only for their own clubs – swung the debate and the District model won by 178 to 24.

The four amateur district teams Glasgow, Edinburgh, South of Scotland and North and Midlands were to become the professional sides Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby, Border Reivers and the Caledonia Reds.

===Professionalisation: Glasgow Warriors===

Glasgow Rugby was created in 1996 to compete in the Heineken Cup, because the Scottish Rugby Union did not think that Scottish club sides would be able to compete against the best teams from France and England.

For a detailed season by season guide of Glasgow Warriors history see:

===Scottish Inter-District Championship era===

Glasgow and the other three Scottish districts competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship to determine their European Qualifying; the leagues positions determining whether they entered the Heineken Cup or the Challenge Cup for the following season.

Due to Glasgow District&#x27;s bottom placing in the 1995–96 Scottish Inter-District Championship, Glasgow was entered into the 1996–97 European Challenge Cup where they finished second bottom of their group.

Results improved somewhat domestically in 1996-97 with Glasgow securing second place in that season&#x27;s Inter-District Championship behind Caledonia Reds.

That meant that Glasgow qualified for the Heineken Cup for the first time, in the 1997–98 season. In their group stage that season finishing second, they qualified out of the group only to be well beaten in the Quarter Final play-off by Leicester Tigers.

====Merger with Caledonia Reds====

Because of the SRU&#x27;s high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield Stadium, there was a recognised need for further reorganisation. After two seasons, Glasgow merged with the Caledonia Reds to form a team that would be known as Glasgow Caledonians.

Edinburgh Rugby similarly merged with the Border Reivers. In effect, both the Glasgow and Edinburgh clubs took over the other districts. Glasgow&#x27;s new &#x27;Caledonian&#x27; label was later quietly dropped at the start of the 2001–02 season, with the team name becoming once again Glasgow Rugby. The Glasgow side however became colloquially known as Glasgow Warriors from at least the 2001–02 season onwards.

Only two professional sides remaining meant that the 1998–99 Scottish Inter-District Championship was fought out in a three match &#x27;Tri-Series&#x27; battle between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

The combined sides did not fare better in Europe. Glasgow finished bottom of their group in the 1998–99 Heineken Cup. The SRU realised that Glasgow and Edinburgh needed more competition domestically than each other and so began a successful dialogue with the Welsh Rugby Union that resulted in both Scottish sides being entered in the WRU Challenge Cup in early 1999.

===Welsh-Scottish League era===

The WRU Challenge Cup was deemed a success and the SRU and WRU announced a new league system for the 1999-2000 season. The Welsh-Scottish League was essentially the Welsh Premier Division augmented by the Glasgow and Edinburgh sides.

This meant the end of the Scottish Inter-District Championship although it did continue as before with the amateur district sides. The 1999-2000 season&#x27;s Tri-Series was run without a sponsor. Glasgow won the title, but at a cost; they had beaten Edinburgh four times that season (including twice in the Tri-Series) and Edinburgh&#x27;s only win was the 5th match, a dead rubber at the end of the Tri-Series. The fans didn&#x27;t like the format and it was scrapped.

The Welsh-Scottish League lasted three seasons. Although both Glasgow and Edinburgh finished no higher than mid-table for those three seasons, it did provide the Scottish sides with much needed competition. It was looked on as a successful model of co-operation between two rugby unions. The Irish Rugby Football Union began talks with the SRU and WRU about further extending the co-operation in a new Celtic League.

===Celtic League era===

The Celtic League began in truncated fashion in the autumn of 2001 with the addition of the four Irish provincial teams in two pools; Glasgow reached the semi-finals of the inaugural competition, but struggled thereafter.

In its first year the Celtic League ran concurrently with the 2001–02 Welsh-Scottish League but fixture congestion meant that the Welsh-Scottish tournament was scrapped in favour of the new league. The new Celtic League was an instant success and the SRU took the opportunity to resurrect one of its disbanded districts in 2002. The Border Reivers were thus reborn for 2002–03 season.

The Celtic League remained in its truncated &#x27;pools&#x27; form for 2002–03 season before its expansion to a full league set-up the following season. This gave the SRU a one-off chance to revive the 2002–03 Scottish Inter-District Championship as a professional tournament. Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Borders fought in out in what was the final professional Inter-District championship; the Bank of Scotland Pro Cup. Glasgow finished bottom of the table.

In 2004–05 Glasgow had been fifth in the Celtic League, the best placing of the three Scottish teams that existed at that time.

Starting with the 2005–06 season, the team was again rebranded, this time as the Glasgow Warriors. A drop to 11th place in the league that season sealed Head Coach Hugh Campbell&#x27;s fate and he left the Warriors before the end of the season in March 2006.

In his place, the Warriors promoted his assistant Sean Lineen. Under his reign the Warriors became a mid table side. In his second to last season in 2009-10 the team managed 3rd and secured a semi-final against Ospreys - the club&#x27;s first Celtic League semi final since 2001-02. Ospreys made the home tie count and ran out 20-15 winners; and went on to win the league that year.

The Warriors were looking to push on from that semi-final appearance and become regular play-off contenders for the title. But once again the team slumped to an 11th place finish in 2010-11. This was the last season of the Celtic League as two Italian sides had joined the league and it was rebranded the next season. 

====1872 Cup====

Disappointing results for the Border Reivers saw them disband again in 2007. With only two professional sides once again, the SRU took the opportunity to dust down and rename the 1995 Scottish Inter-District Championship trophy and use the two Celtic League fixtures between Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby as a mini-cup tournament. The Glasgow-Edinburgh &#x27;inter-city&#x27; derby dates back to 1872 and is the oldest provincial match in the world. To mark this, the 1872 Cup thus began in 2007-08.

===Pro12 era===

The Celtic League was rebranded as the Pro12 league in season 2011–12. This was to better reflect the entry of the Italian sides into the Celtic League.

The Pro12 league format had a top four play-off system to decide the champions. The season 2011-12 proved Sean Lineen&#x27;s last season as Head Coach. Once again, the Warriors finished fourth. That meant an away semi-final in Dublin against Leinster. The Irish side won in a narrow 19 - 15 victory. Lineen moved on to take on the Scotland Under 20 coaching position.

New coach Gregor Townsend inherited the squad. He solidified Glasgow Warriors position as title challengers in the league. In 2012-13 the team finished 3rd in the league. They were beaten again in Dublin by Leinster in an even narrower score 17 - 15.

The following season it was no surprise that Leinster and Glasgow were the top two teams in the league. Glasgow&#x27;s trip to Dublin in 2013-14 ended the same way with an Irish win. Townsend later reflected that he got his team talk wrong in the final, although the then speculation over Stuart Hogg&#x27;s future couldn&#x27;t have helped the team either. However the Warriors side, with 7s specialist Carlin Isles starring, did win the Melrose Sevens that year.

Townsend resolved to go one better the following season. The Warriors finished top of the league and again made the final. Last season that would have ensured a vital home final tie. However this 2014-15 season was the first &#x27;destination&#x27; final. So they had to go to Ireland again and face an Irish team. This was Munster and played at Ulster&#x27;s Kingspan stadium. The Irish were again confident but Glasgow simply blitzed Munster in the final winning 31 - 13 for the Warriors first league title since the 1999-2000 Scottish Inter-District Championship &#x27;Tri-Series&#x27;. Glasgow also successfully defended their Melrose Sevens title, beating the German international 7s side in the final.

The following season 2015-16 was a world cup year. With so many Warriors players away with Scotland - and the perennial problem of Scotland only having 2 pro sides - Townsend looked to Europe to make an impact. However Saracens ended their Champions Cup hopes at the quarter final stage. The unfancied Connacht stepped up this year in the Pro12. The Connacht side generally lost the fewest players to the Irish national side and this helped them make a run for the title. They beat Glasgow in Galway in the semi-final, with Finn Russell injured with a serious cheekbone fracture at the start of the match. Connacht then secured the title in a destination final at Murrayfield stadium.

Townsend&#x27;s last season was 2016-17. It was announced early that Townsend would be taking over the Scotland international job from Vern Cotter. He had made Glasgow Warriors a fixture in the Pro12 playoffs and made the side champions in 2015. The early announcement this season resulted in a bit of instability and that season Townsend finished in the Warriors lowest position of 6th in his tenure. 2016-17 season was also the last season of the Pro12. 2 South African sides joined the following year and the league was rebranded as the Pro14.

Since the Pro12 started in season 2011–12, Glasgow Warriors were the only team that have made the play-offs in every year, but this record was finally broken at the end of the 2016–17 season on 28 April 2017 when the Warriors lost to Leinster in Dublin ensuring that a top 4 finish for the Glasgow side was unattainable.

Glasgow Warriors hold the Pro12 record of the highest number of consecutive seasons that a team has made the play-offs – with 5 seasons between 2011–12 and 2015–16. Going further back and taking the Celtic League into account, this record is also shared with Leinster who made the play-offs in the last 2 years of the Celtic League and first 3 years of the Pro12.

===Pro14 era===

With the addition of two South African sides, the Pro12 expanded to become the Pro14 for season 2017-18.

The format of the league changed to accommodate the extra teams. It was split into two conferences and matches played in a conference system with the addition of 2 derby fixtures. The play-off system also changed with the winners of the conferences hosting a Semi-Final and each conference runners up and 3rd place teams playing off in Quarter-Final fixtures.

For the Pro14&#x27;s inaugural season, Glasgow Warriors were placed in a conference with the Ospreys, Blues, Munster, Connacht, Zebre and Cheetahs. After a blistering start with 10 straight wins, the Warriors were the first team to secure a play-off place. The Warriors won top place in Conference A and secured a home semi-final. Inconsistent form in the latter half of the season then cost the Warriors; losing in the semi-final to Scarlets.

Glasgow Warriors&#x27; conference did not change for season 2018-19 but home and away fixtures were swapped from the previous year.
Other than a blip against the Southern Kings and a notable dip in the Festive period against Edinburgh and Benetton Treviso, by and large Glasgow Warriors seemed to ease through their fixtures. By the end of the regular season Glasgow were top of Conference A again and setting new records:- the final regular season match against Edinburgh Rugby saw the Warriors hit a club record of 7 consecutive try bonus point league wins; their total of 15 try bonus points throughout the season was a new Pro14 record; their 81 points scored was the most ever scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors; and their 83 tries was the most scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors; and their 621 points scored was the most scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors. They narrowly lost to Leinster in the final at Celtic Park following an error by Stuart Hogg in the Warriors try-line. The Celtic Park final attendance, swelled by Glasgow Warriors fans normally unable to watch at a sold-out Scotstoun, remains the highest in the Celtic League/Pro12/Pro14 history.

In 2019–20, the Warriors started poorly but results picked up as the season progressed. By the end of February 2020, Glasgow Warriors had solidified the play-off 3rd spot and were hopeful of a decent run to overtake Ulster into the 2nd place in their conference. However, the COVID-19 pandemic intervened and Pro14 matches were stopped. The season restarted at the end of August; but it was instead curtailed, now with only two matches to play, meaning it was virtually impossible to catch Ulster in the second spot. Worse for the Warriors was the Pro14 decision to not play any Quarter-Final matches which meant that they would not be involved in the play-offs. Missing out, the final was played between Leinster and Ulster, with Leinster winning.

Season 2020-21 was still affected with the COVID-19 pandemic; this meant very limited or usually no fans at the matches. The Southern Kings went bankrupt and the Cheetahs were unable to compete due to the pandemic, so the Pro14 ran with 12 European sides, still in two conferences. They did however court some of the South African &quot;Super Rugby Unlocked&quot; franchises for the following season and organised an end of season tournament – the Rainbow Cup – which because of COVID-19 was run as a mini European league of the Pro14 sides; and a South African league of their 4 biggest franchises that the Pro14 wished to invite – the winners of the two leagues would play off in a final. Glasgow Warriors stuttered in the Pro14 and only improved towards the end of the tournament. They managed to still secure a Champions Cup spot despite their early form. The end of season Rainbow Cup saw Glasgow lose their match against the surprise eventual Rainbow Cup tournament winners Benetton Treviso but then win the rest of their matches, securing the 1872 Cup along the way and beating this season&#x27;s Pro14 winners Leinster in their last match.

===United Rugby Championship era===

The European sides were again joined by the South African franchises in season 2021–22. The championship was split in four conferences:- a Scottish-Italian conference, a South African conference, a Welsh conference and an Irish conference. The Warriors stuttered through the URC campaign. They seemed to have a bad knack of winning fixtures until the last quarter and then blowing their lead. Still, home results remained a bit better than the away fixtures. By the end of April they were just about managing to cling onto top 4 in the URC. Then the form stopped stuttering, but unfortunately things got worse. They bowed out of the Champions Cup at the hands of La Rochelle (the eventual winners of the European Cup that season), to find themselves in the Challenge Cup. A win against Newcastle Falcons papered over cracks but they were beaten in the quarter-final against Lyon, again losing the match from a winning position. (Lyon went on to win the Challenge Cup.)

Beaten by both European winners may have been understandable but the Glasgow side&#x27;s league form was much worse and a run of away fixtures hardly helped. Beaten by the Stormers and Bulls, the Warriors lost the 1872 Cup deciding match to Edinburgh. Not only did Edinburgh secure the 1872 Cup, but it meant that Edinburgh leapfrogged Glasgow Warriors in the league and also won the Scottish-Italian conference. Glasgow Warriors finished 8th; their lowest league position since 2010–11. It was the first time that Edinburgh finished higher than Glasgow since that 2010–11 season. Finishing 8th meant that Glasgow failed to qualify for the Champions Cup next season. The last time that happened was the 2005–06 season, causing Hugh Campbell to lose his job; and they played the 2006–07 season in the Challenge Cup under Sean Lineen. Eighth place in 2021-22 did qualify the Warriors for the last quarter-final place of the URC, but they were given the 1st seeds Leinster in Dublin to play. The Warriors failed to regroup for the quarter-final and although they again started brightly the team predictably slumped. It was quite a slump too, a 76–14 defeat: it was the Warriors worst result domestically; and their second-worse result of all time. Only the Leicester Tigers European quarter-final play-off match of 1997–98 season, a 90–19 defeat, was worse. The SRU was quick to act in the face of these poor results and Danny Wilson was stood down as Head Coach.

Just before the 2022–23 season began, Glasgow hired Franco Smith. It took a few games for the team to settle into the new coach, but they did and results followed. Glasgow went unbeaten at home in the regular URC season, and in European Challenge Cup Glasgow tore through opposition till the final. Winning the 1872 Cup and the Scottish-Italian Shield, they made 4th in the URC, playing Munster at home in the Quarter-Final. A red card to Tom Jordan made it difficult for the Warriors and they lost the match 14–5 to the Irish side. In the European Challenge Cup final, a devastating first half by Toulon scoring 21 points without reply left the Warriors too much to do in the second half and the French side won out 43–19. Nevertheless, it was a very successful first season under Smith, with the side back challenging on all fronts after the slump of the Danny Wilson era. He was named URC coach of the year.

Scotstoun remained a fortress in the URC and they remained unbeaten at home in the 2023–24 season. Indeed, only the Stormers, the Sharks, Edinburgh and Cardiff managed to prevent Glasgow taking the bonus point win there. Away from home, the Warriors were beaten five times. Once by Connacht, once by Munster, in the 1872 Cup match against Edinburgh - though not enough to stop the 1872 Cup heading to Glasgow again, and crucially at the end of the season an away loss to the Bulls and the Lions. The Warriors lost their 1st place in the league by the two South African losses, and finished the season 4th in the table, but only 3 points behind 1st place.

The play-offs meant that Glasgow faced the Stomers at home. In blustery conditions the Warriors comfortably won the match, helped by the Stomers poor kicking in the wind. The quarter final was against Munster away at Thomond Park. Munster displaying advertising promoting the final between them and the Bulls before the match gave Glasgow extra impetus and they outplayed the Irish side. That meant a final in South Africa at Loftus Versfeld. The Bulls won the match before, but like that match Glasgow knew they could win the second half, if they could keep the first half tight. A score at the end of the first half by Scott Cummings made the half time score 13–7 to the Bulls; and the Warriors stepped on the gas in the second half with tries by George Turner and Huw Jones. Glasgow saw out the match 21 - 16, with the Bulls only scoring 3pts in the second half, to become URC champions.

==Women&#x27;s team==

In December 2023, Glasgow launched a women&#x27;s team to compete in the Celtic Challenge, a cross-border competition that is designed to develop players for the Celtic nations, starting in the 2023–24 season.

==Stadium==

For the most part, Glasgow Warriors through the years have played their matches in Glasgow either at Hughenden Stadium, Firhill Stadium or Scotstoun Stadium, their current base.

A closer look at the club&#x27;s history reveals a more nomadic nature. Some of this was planned as the club took over the Caledonia Reds district; or a liberal spreading of the Warriors brand to various grounds for friendlies and smaller ties; and some of this was caused by inclement weather; in particular the Warriors had to play several games at the football ground of Kilmarnock F.C. in 2015/16. The laying of a synthetic pitch at Scotstoun Stadium for the 2016-17 season resolved those weather-related issues, though there have on occasion been complaints from visiting teams about the synthetic surface.

To accommodate their fans and further promote rugby in Glasgow, the Warriors made the decision to play their home 1872 Cup match at Hampden Park in Glasgow in December 2024. That decision was vindicated by almost 28,000 fans turning out at the football stadium, almost four times their Scotstoun capacity.

===Stadia moves===

Originally based at Hughenden Stadium in 1996-97, Glasgow moved to Scotstoun Stadium for the 1997-98 season. Rugby at Scotstoun, however, goes back even further, right to the beginning of the 1900s when the likes of Glasgow HSFP and Kelvinside Accies along with others played there on their journeys to Old Anniesland and Balgray respectively.

The merger with the Caledonia Reds for the season caused the Warriors to play their matches not only at Hughenden and Firhill Stadium in Glasgow, but also at Perth&#x27;s McDiarmid Park and Aberdeen&#x27;s Rubislaw Playing Fields as it consolidated the traditional North and Midlands district.

The following year saw the Warriors additionally play at Bridgehaugh Park in Stirling. the Caledonian Stadium in Inverness and Millbrae in Ayr.

From the 2000-01 season Glasgow settled in Hughenden through to the middle of 2005-06 season, after which Firhill was used briefly. However the following year Hughenden was used again.

The Warriors moved to Firhill Stadium in 2007–08 season and that was the club&#x27;s base until the summer of 2012.

In 2012, Glasgow Warriors moved from Firhill back to Scotstoun Stadium, which had previously been the club&#x27;s training base.

In addition to those grounds above:- Rugby Park in Kilmarnock; Old Anniesland in Glasgow; Braidholm in Giffnock; Whitecraigs in Newton Mearns; London Road in Stranraer; Burnbrae in Milngavie, North Inch in Perth and Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh have all hosted home matches for the Glasgow side.

==Fans==
Glasgow Warriors fans are collectively known as the Warrior Nation. The official supporters club is The XVIth Warrior, founded in 2012.

===Home===

Although the current Scotstoun Stadium capacity has occasionally been increased to 10,000 for selected matches, from the 2016–17 season the standard capacity at home is now 7351, which regularly sells out. There is now a record number of season ticket holders at the club.

Such is the demand for tickets at Glasgow, it had been reported that Mark Dodson, former chief executive of the Scottish Rugby Union, was in talks with Glasgow City Council about building a bigger stand on the railway side of Scotstoun Stadium.

A quirk of such high demand is seen when you compare the 2015-16 standard capacity at Scotstoun (6800) with Glasgow&#x27;s seasonal average attendance (6950) The seasonal higher than capacity average was made possible when Scotstoun Stadium became unplayable that winter and home games were switched to the higher capacity grounds of Rugby Park and Murrayfield Stadium.

===Away===

The away support of the Glasgow Warriors ranges from about 300 fans for a Pro12 match in Italy to around several thousand fans for the 1872 Cup away match against Edinburgh Rugby at Murrayfield Stadium.

The Pro12 Grand Finals of 2013–14 season and 2014–15 season, in Dublin and Belfast respectively, saw around 4 to 5 thousand of the Warrior Nation follow their team to Ireland each time.

The 2016-17 European Champions Cup Quarter Final away to Saracens saw 6000 of the Warrior Nation make their way to Allianz Park and provided the London side with their highest ever home attendance.

===Fanzones===

Various public houses around Glasgow have operated as Fanzones for the club. The official Fanzone for the 2016–17 season was The Crafty Pig. For 2018–19 season The Old Schoolhouse is the XVIth Warriors fanzone. For the 2024–25 season, it remains The Old Schoolhouse and additionally The Beechwood Bar in Kings Park.

<text>Dunmore East () is a popular tourist and fishing village in County Waterford, Ireland. Situated on the west side of Waterford Harbour on Ireland&#x27;s southeastern coast, it lies within the barony of Gaultier ( – &quot;land of the foreigner&quot; in Irish); a reference to the influx of Viking and Norman settlers in the area.

==History==
Iron Age people established a promontory fort overlooking the sea at Shanoon (referred to in 1832 as meaning the &#x27;Old Camp&#x27; but more likely Canon Power&#x27;s , &quot;Old Cave&quot;) at a point known for centuries as Black Nobb, where the old pilot station now stands, and underneath which a cave runs. Henceforth the place was referred to as , meaning the &quot;Great Fort&quot;.

In 1640, Lord Power of Curraghmore, who owned a large amount of property in the area, built a castle on the cliff overlooking the strand about two hundred metres from St. Andrew&#x27;s Church. The castle was falling into ruin by the middle of the next century and now just one tower remains. The old church of Killea ( meaning &quot;Aodh&#x27;s church&quot;) is thought to have been built in the twelfth century and one wall still stands, opposite the Roman Catholic church of The Holy Cross, at the top of Killea hill.

In Smith&#x27;s history of Waterford, the village was mentioned as being a fishing port about the year 1745. The fishermen&#x27;s homes were situated in the Lower Village near the Strand Inn and boats were launched from the slip at Lawlor&#x27;s Beach before the harbour was built. There is mention of a fleet of fifty fishing boats working from Dunmore East in 1776.

In 1812, a decision was made at Westminster to create an entirely new landing point for passengers and the Royal Mail coming to Ireland from London and southern England. The location selected for the erection of a pier was Dunmore East. In 1814, dramatic changes took place when Alexander Nimmo, the Scottish engineer (builder of Limerick&#x27;s Sarsfield Bridge) commenced work on the new harbour at Dunmore. The work consisted mainly of a massive pier or quay with an elegant lighthouse at the end. Nimmo&#x27;s original estimate had been £20,000 but at the time of his death in 1832 about £93,000 had been spent and the final cost was £108,000. By then (1837) the harbour had started to silt up, and the arrival of steam meant that the winding river could be negotiated easily, so the packet station was transferred to Waterford.

The great sheltered harbour then constructed meant that Dunmore East was to gradually become an important fishing port. It also then developed into a very popular tourist resort and it is now a favourite port of call for large cruise liners visiting the south-east of Ireland. The Haven Hotel, formerly the Villa Marina, was a home built by David Malcomson of Portlaw. David married Nanette King of Waterford and he brought his new bride to live in their family home at Dunmore East.

The Fisherman&#x27;s Hall in the village was also built by Nanette Malcomson in memory of her son Joseph who had been a fisherman and died at a relatively young age. She donated the land for the building and established a deed of trust to build and maintain the Hall. On her specific instructions, no alcohol could be sold or consumed in the Hall. In addition, a fire was to be kept lit to warm and dry any of the fishermen who arrived to read the newspapers which were replenished daily in the reading room which is the present-day Library.

==Sport==

Dunmore East is home to many sporting clubs from sailing to Gaelic Football. Gaultier GAA which focuses primarily on Gaelic Football is located just outside the village, across the road from Dunmore FC soccer club. Gaultier GAA was founded in 1927 and compete in the Waterford Senior Football Championship as well as catering for over 100 juvenile members. Dunmore FC was founded in the 1970s initially before being re-established in the early to mid-2000s. The Waterford Harbour Sailing Club was founded in 1934.

==Harbour==

The harbour is one of the five designated National Fishery Harbours, and has the second highest figure for fish landings after Killybegs. In the summer months it is popular with visiting yachts which have a designated pontoon. A plan was developed in 2005 by Waterford County Council to expand the harbour to accommodate more recreational marine activities. However that plan appears to have been shelved due to lack of funding.

The first official woman crew member in a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Lifeboat was based at Dunmore East.

== Amish-Mennonite Community ==
Ireland&#x27;s only Amish-Mennonite community resides in Dunmore East. The community consists of approximately 100 individuals, including 15 families, and is known for its welcoming nature and openness to growth. They operate several enterprises, including a bakery, a bookshop, a petrol station, and training schools for woodworking, forestry, and animal husbandry.

Educationally, the community integrates with the Irish curriculum, with children attending schools that prepare them for the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate examinations.

==Tourism==
Tourism in Dunmore East is supported by boating and sailing facilities, holiday homes, traditional pubs, a golf course and several hotels. The village is home to the Waterford Harbour Sailing Club with dinghy and keelboat sailing and the Dunmore East Adventure Centre. The local golf course is located on the cliff top overlooking the bay.Sea angling and Diving is catered for by Dunmore East Angling Charters.
Dunmore East has several seafood restaurants, and there are a number of hotels in Dunmore: The Strand Inn and The Haven Hotel, a historic former Malcomson home and the Ocean Hotel. There are also caravan sites catering for motorhomes and touring caravans.

Among the events held in Dunmore East is the annual bluegrass festival which takes place at the end of August. During this festival the village hosts a number of bluegrass groups over the weekend during which almost every bar becomes a music venue from 3 pm until late in the evening.

Tourist walking routes have been recently opened at Dunmore East. Trails in the woods, which surround the village, 
consist of a series of marked paths of varying lengths. There is also a popular cliff path to Portally and on to Ballymacaw which is about in total length. This includes what may be Ireland&#x27;s longest sea cave at Rathmoylan. This path starts from the car park at the Shanoon.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Dunmore East is twinned with the village of Clohars-Carnoët in France.

==Transport==
There is a good road connection to Waterford City. Bus Éireann route 354 links the village to Waterford replacing the longstanding Suirway service which ceased at Halloween, 2022.

<doc id="985852" wikidata="Q5995408" url="?curid=985852" title="Ikarus (typography software)">
<text>Ikarus is a type design and production software developed by URW and Brendel Informatik foundries, for converting existing typefaces and logos into digital format for use on computer driven printing, plotting and sign cutting devices.

It was licensed by major foundries such as Agfa-Compugraphic, Autologic, Berthold, International Typeface Corporation, Letraset, Linotype, Monotype, Stempel, and others.

Its &quot;IK&quot; format was convertible into diverse vendor representations, including Type3 and Type1 PostScript formats as well as the TrueType format by Apple and Microsoft.

Ikarus uses a spline model of the outline shape of each character within a typeface to give a fully scalable representation. The curve segments are essentially circle arcs, with tangent continuity maintained at joins. It is a very simple format to mark up manually. Being a vector/curve based format, any rendering resolution can be attained (by rasterisation) with equal accuracy from one relatively small set of data. The Ikarus coordinates for a shape all fall on the outline of that shape (as opposed to Bézier curves where &#x27;control&#x27; points can be inside or outside the outline).

The functionality of Ikarus can be expanded using plug-ins.

==History==
Originally invented by URW employee Dr Peter Karow, Ikarus (German spelling of the mythical figure Icarus) got its name from the frequency with which it crashed in the early days of its development. It was designed to run on minicomputers such as DEC VAX and later adapted to microcomputers as they became increasingly powerful. In 1975, IKARUS was introduced at ATypI in Warsaw.

By the 1980s a huge library of typefaces and logos existed as photographic film and needed to be input into computers for the latest generation of printing and sign-making devices. Unfortunately, normal scanning gives a rasterized shape at the resolution of the scanning device which leads to degradation of quality when scaling up and down. This is a particular concern in the sign making industry where individual letters may be metres across, many times the size of the original artwork. Ikarus enables a human operator to input the features of a complex shape with curves, corners and straight lines (e.g. a letter of the alphabet) to a computer which stores it as a mathematical representation, for all intents and purposes independent of the size of the original artwork and of the final output. A version of Ikarus tailored for signmaking applications was released by URW as &quot;Signus&quot;.

The advent of desktop publishing in the 1980s using Apple Macintosh computers coupled with laser printers led to a shift away from a small number of specialized print bureaux acquiring relatively expensive fonts to a growing market for cheap mass-produced fonts. The drawback of Ikarus for catering for this new market was that, while extremely accurate, it was very labour-intensive.

After Adobe Systems started licensing BuildFont, its technology for converting existing digital typeface data into PostScript font format, Ikarus gradually lost its leading position. Ikarus is being further developed by URW++ and DTL, Dutch Type Library, ’s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands.

==Digitizing==
The first stage of digitization of a typeface is to prepare the artwork by marking up. This involves putting tick marks around any curves at approximately 30 degree intervals along with extra tangent points where a curve blends onto a straight line. Some form of accurate graphics tablet is then used to input three types of points: curve points, corner points and tangent points. Any irregularities (e.g. lumps and flat spots) are then edited out by adjusting the position of the points on the computer. The human eye is extremely sensitive to spotting irregularities on smooth outlines and typical adjustments are of the order of tenths of millimetres on a character one hundred millimetres high. As the computer screen displays a rasterized image at relatively low resolution, high quality print outs (traditionally bromides) or cuts in film (Ulano) are used to proof the digitized shapes.

==Relationship with DTL FontMaster==
The DTL FontMaster core is based on Ikarus. Furthermore, URW is also the exclusive Germany distributor for Dutch Type Library, DTL FontMaster&#x27;s developer. DTL FontMaster Utilities are also developed by URW with DTL&#x27;s president and founder Frank Blokland.

<doc id="985855" wikidata="Q7113036" url="?curid=985855" title="Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon">
<text>The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is a military award of the United States Air Force which was created on February 21, 1968 by order of Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown. The first presentation of the award was in June 1970. The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is the highest personal ribbon award of the United States Air Force.

==Criteria==
The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is awarded to any enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force who is nominated by their Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit for competition in the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Program. The Outstanding Airman of the Year program recognizes 12 enlisted members from a cross section of Air Force Career fields. Nominated personnel compete in one of three categories Airman, Non-commissioned Officer, and Senior Non-commissioned Officer. Nominations are based only on the member&#x27;s performance and achievement for the prior calendar year. Though only the prior year is used for nominations, nominees must pass a certain level of scrutiny for their total life and career since nominees are expected to be the most outstanding representatives of the Air Force enlisted force.

==Appearance==

The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is light blue with a center stripe of white, flanked on either side by thin stripes of dark blue and red.

Airmen selected as one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year are authorized to wear the Outstanding Airman badge for one year, and are awarded the ribbon with a bronze service star. All other nominated competitors are authorized to wear the ribbon without the service star. Subsequent awards of the ribbon are represented by oak leaf clusters, with the service star being worn to the wearers right.

<text>Víctor José Davalillo Romero (31 July 1939 – 6 December 2023) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Mexican League as an outfielder from 1963 to 1982.

Davalillo (pronounced da-va-LEE-yo) played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians (1963–68), California Angels (1968–69), St. Louis Cardinals (1969–70), Pittsburgh Pirates (1971–73), Oakland Athletics (1973–74), and Los Angeles Dodgers (1977–80)
as an outfielder.

Davalillo, who batted and threw left-handed, was a leadoff hitter known for his speedy baserunning and capable defense. He was a fan favorite during his years with the Indians, and became a valuable utility player later in his career. He was also recognized as a superb pinch hitter.

Davalillo also had an exceptional career in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he is the all-time leader in total base hits and career batting average. He played for 30 years in the U.S., Mexico, and his homeland, compiling more than 4,100 base hits total.

==Early life==
Although many baseball references show Davalillo&#x27;s birthplace as Cabimas, Venezuela, in 2006 he told a biographer that he was born in Churuguara, Falcón on 31 July 1939. Other sources have given his date of birth as 30 July 1939, or sometime in 1936. His family moved to Cabimas a few days after he was born. He grew up in the Costa Oriental region on Lake Maracaibo. His older brother, Pompeyo Davalillo, played briefly for the Washington Senators in 1953.

==U.S. minor league career==
Davalillo began his career as a pitcher. He signed a contract as an amateur free agent with the Cincinnati Reds in . He was sold to the Indians organisation in 1961 and moved up the ladder to Jacksonville, their Triple-A club in the International League. Davalillo won the first batting title in the Jacksonville Suns history with a .346 batting average in 1962.

==Major league career (first phase)==
Davalillo became the eighth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball when he joined the Indians in 1963 as their leadoff hitter and center fielder. By mid-June, he was hitting for a .304 batting average and was receiving consideration for the American League Rookie of the Year Award when, he was hit by a pitch by Hank Aguirre and suffered a broken wrist. He returned from the injury to lead the Indians in hitting with a .292 along with a career-high 7 home runs in 90 games however, after the injury, he was never the same hitter against left handed pitching. In October, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team. The following season, Davalillo finished second in the league in fielding percentage among center fielders and was named as a recipient of the American League Gold Glove Award. He was the first left-handed throwing outfielder to win an American League Gold Glove Award (Vada Pinson won the National League Gold Glove Award as a left-handed outfielder).

In 1965, Davalillo led the league in batting at mid-season with a .345 batting average, earning him a place as the starting center fielder for the American League team in the 1965 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .301 batting average, third-best in the American League behind Tony Oliva and Carl Yastrzemski, the only other players to break the .300 mark that year. Davalillo had an off year in 1966, and the Indians began to use him in a platoon role, playing him when they faced right-handed pitchers. In 1967, he hit for a .302 average against right-handed pitchers but, only managed a .188 average against left handers, for a .287 average overall.

Davalillo was batting .239 with 12 runs batted in (RBI) when he was traded from the Indians to the California Angels for Jimmie Hall before the trade deadline on 15 June 1968. He rebounded to lead the Angels with a .298 batting average after the trade, finishing the season with a .277 average overall, the sixth highest average in the American League. In an era dominated by pitching, Yastrzemski was the only player in the American League to hit for an average higher than .300 in .

In January , Davalillo suffered a nervous breakdown while he was in Venezuela to play in the Venezuelan Winter League. He began the 1969 season hitting for only a .155 average in 33 games and on 30 May, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Jim Hicks. In his first National League at bat on 1 June, 1969, Davalillo hit a three-run home run. He also made two appearances as a relief pitcher for the Cardinals in 1969 but failed to retire any batters. He is one of 14 pitchers in Major League history to have posted an infinite ERA, and the only one to have pitched in more than one game.

Davalillo became a utility player and highly effective pinch hitter with the Cardinals in 1970. He was originally credited with 24 pinch hits in , which broke the National League record set by Sam Leslie (1932) and tied by Red Schoendienst (1962). He also ostensibly tied the major-league single-season mark, also set by Dave Philley in . The total was subsequently corrected to 23, but while Davalillo was still credited with holding it, it was broken in by José Morales. One of the previous National League record holders was also his manager in 1970: Red Schoendienst. Davalillo ended the season with a .311 average and 33 runs batted in.

The Cardinals traded Davalillo along with Nelson Briles to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Matty Alou and George Brunet in January . He continued in his role as a utility player, facing mostly right-handed pitchers and playing all three outfield positions and as a first baseman. Davalillo ended the year with a .285 batting average, helping the Pirates clinch the National League Eastern Division title. The Pirates went on to defeat the San Francisco Giants in the 1971 National League Championship Series before winning the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. In 1972, he continued to be a valuable role player, hitting for a career-high .318 batting average in 117 games, helping the Pirates win the Eastern Division pennant, before they lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1972 National League Championship Series.

In July 1973, the Pirates sold Davalillo to the Oakland Athletics, who were in the midst of a pennant race with the Kansas City Royals. The Athletics eventually won the American League West Division and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the 1973 American League Championship Series. Davalillo had five hits in eight at-bats for a .625 batting average during the championship series, including a crucial RBI triple in the deciding Game 5.

The Athletics then went on to defeat the New York Mets in the 1973 World Series. Davalillo played in six of the seven games, starting twice in center field and going 1-for-11 altogether.

After appearing in 17 games for the Athletics in the 1974 season, Davalillo was released on 30 May.

==Mexican League==
Davalillo then played three seasons in the Mexican League. He was the league&#x27;s top hitter with a .384 batting average in . He continued to pitch on occasion.

==Comeback in the majors==
The Los Angeles Dodgers, seeking an experienced reserve, purchased Davalillo&#x27;s contract in August 1977. As a pinch hitter and a defensive substitute, he posted a .313 batting average in 24 games for the Dodgers in 1977, helping them win the National League West Division crown. Davalillo thus became the first major-leaguer to play for three different teams in the League Championship Series (Pittsburgh in –, Oakland in and Los Angeles in ).

Davalillo&#x27;s pinch-hitting talent played a prominent role in the Dodgers&#x27; come-from-behind victory in Game 3 of the 1977 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Trailing the Phillies 5–3 with 2 outs in the 9th inning, he spearheaded a three-run rally by surprising the Phillies defense with a perfectly executed drag bunt. Manny Mota drove Davalillo home with a double, then scored on a single by Davey Lopes to tie the game. The Dodgers eventually won the game and went on to win Game 4 to clinch the National League championship.

In the 1977 World Series against the New York Yankees, Davalillo made three pinch-hitting appearances, driving home one run with a single as the Dodgers lost the series in six games.

At the age of 42 in 1978, Davalillo hit for a .312 average as a pinch hitter for the Dodgers as they once again claimed the National League pennant before losing to the New York Yankees for a second consecutive year in the 1978 World Series.

Davalillo remained on manager Tommy Lasorda&#x27;s squad to start the 1979 season, but in mid-June, he returned to Triple-A ball for the first time in 17 years. He rejoined the big club in September, going 4-for-10.

==Continued action in Mexico and the majors==
After the 1979 season the Dodgers released Davalillo. He returned to Mexico, and after he hit .394 in 94 games, the Dodgers reached out for him again. He played for the Dodgers&#x27; Triple-A team in Albuquerque and was called up at age 44 for his last six big-league at-bats in September and October 1980.

Davalillo played in 40 final games in the Mexican League in 1981. His career south of the border continued, however, in the little-known Liga Nacional. This circuit was started in 1981 by ANABE (Asociación Nacional de Beisbolistas), a Mexican players&#x27; association. Davalillo played in 1982 for Lechugueros de León in 1982. If Liga Nacional records still exist, they would be extremely difficult to find, but apparently Davalillo hit .360 in 124 games for the Lettuce Growers. In 1986 he was invited to join another Liga Nacional club, Tuzos de Zacatecas, but the circuit folded before he played for the Gophers.

==Winter League career==
Davalillo kept playing in the Venezuelan Winter League until the age of 50. All told, he played in 30 seasons between 1957 and 1987:

* 19 for the Leones del Caracas (1957–58 through 1974–75, 1986–87)
* One for &quot;Tibuleones&quot; de Portuguesa (1975–76)
* 10 for the Tigres de Aragua (1976–77 through 1985–86).

Davalillo retired after appearing in the 1987 Caribbean Series.

==Other leagues in Venezuela==
* 1959–60: Liga Occidental Zuliana (postseason reinforcement)
* 1983: Liga Centro Occidental
* 1985–86: Liga de Verano (as player-manager)
* 1985: Liga Instruccional &quot;Angel Millán&quot;

==Death==
Davalillo died in Caracas from complications of surgery on 6 December 2023, at the age of 84.

==Career statistics==
In a 16-year major-league career, Davalillo played in 1,458 games, accumulating 1,122 hits in 4,017 at bats for a .279 career batting average along with 36 home runs, 329 runs batted in, a .315 on-base percentage, 509 runs, 160 doubles, 37 triples, and 125 stolen bases. He finished his career at center field with a .988 fielding percentage, ranking him 61st among major league center fielders since .

As a pinch hitter in MLB, he recorded 95 hits in 367 at-bats (.259) with 5 home runs and 48 RBI.

In the Venezuelan Winter League, he set lifetime league records that still stand in batting average (.325), hits (1,505), games played (1,280), at-bats (4,633), runs (668), doubles (196), runs batted in (483) and career seasons (30). Beside this, he won four batting titles and set record in hits (100) in a season.

The 2019 biography &quot;Vitico al Bate&quot; credits him with 4,158 total base hits as a professional:

* Along with 1,505 regular-season hits in the Venezuelan winter league, 131 in that league&#x27;s postseason and 21 more in All-Star games
* Along with 1,122 in the major leagues, 10 more in MLB postseason play and one in the All-Star Game
* Along with 379 in the U.S. minors, three in a minor-league All-Star game
* 829 in Mexico
* 130 in other Venezuelan leagues
* 27 in the Caribbean Series and Inter-American Series

==Honors==
In 1987, the ballpark in Cabimas, Zulia, was renamed Estadio Víctor Davalillo. The Most Valuable Player award in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League is also named after him.

In 2003, Davalillo was selected to the inaugural class of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

The Venezuelan winter league played its 2019–20 season in Davalillo&#x27;s honor.

In March 2022, a youth baseball program in Caracas called &quot;Escuela de Beisbol Menor Víctor Davalillo&quot; began operations.

The book &quot;Portrait of a Franchise: An Intimate Look at Cleveland Indians Baseball during the Rockin&#x27; Sixties&quot; includes a chapter about Davalillo.

<text>Lismore () is a historic town in County Waterford, in the province of Munster, Ireland. Originally associated with Saint Mochuda of Lismore, who founded Lismore Abbey in the 7th century, the town developed around the medieval Lismore Castle. As of the 21st century, Lismore supports a rural catchment area, and was designated as a &quot;district service centre&quot; in Waterford County Council&#x27;s 2011–2017 development plan. As of 2022, the town had a population of 1,347 people.

==History==
Founded by Saint Mochuda (Irish: Mo Chutu mac Fínaill), died 637, also known as Saint Carthage (Carthach or Carthach the Younger; Latinised: Carthagus, Anglicised: Carthage), first abbot of Lismore (Irish: Les Mór Mo Chutu). The town is renowned for its early ecclesiastical history and the scholarship of Lismore Abbey.

The imposing Lismore Castle, situated on the site of the old monastery since medieval times, lies on a steep hill overlooking the town and the Blackwater valley. It can trace an eight-hundred-year-old history linking the varied historic relations between England and Ireland. Originally built following the arrival of Henry II&#x27;s son, Prince John, in the twelfth century, the castle was a bishop&#x27;s palace up to the sixteenth century. Subsequently, owned by Sir Walter Raleigh until his demise, it was sold to Richard Boyle, controversial First Earl of Cork, described by historian R. F. Foster, in his &quot;Modern Ireland&quot;, as an &quot;epitome of Elizabethan adventurer-colonist in Ireland&quot;. In 1627 the castle was the birthplace of the First Earl&#x27;s most famous son, Robert Boyle (of Boyle&#x27;s law), known as the &quot;Father of Modern Chemistry&quot;. Boyle was chased off his lands in Ireland during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, following which his sons recovered the family estates after suppression of the rebellion. The castle remained in the possession of the Boyle family until it passed to the English Dukes of Devonshire in 1753 when the daughter of the 4th Earl of Cork, Lady Charlotte Boyle, married the Marquess of Hartington, who later succeeded as, in 1755, The 4th Duke of Devonshire, a future prime minister of Great Britain and First Lord of the Treasury.
The &quot;Book of Lismore&quot; (original name: &quot;Leabhar Mhic Cárthaigh Riabhaigh&quot;, meaning &quot;The Book of Mac Cárthaigh Riabhach&quot;), a compilation of medieval Irish manuscripts mainly relating the lives of Irish saints, notably St Brigid, St Patrick, and St Columba, also contains &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;, a most important Middle Irish narrative dating to the 12th century, pertaining to the Fenian Cycle. The &quot;Book of Lismore&quot; and the Lismore Crozier (an enclosure for an episcopal staff, believed to be the venerable oaken staff of the founder of the abbey), were discovered together in 1814 behind a blocked-up doorway in Lismore Castle. Today, the castle continues in the private ownership of the Dukes of Devonshire who open the gardens and parts of the grounds for public access via a changing programme of local arts and education events. The &quot;Book of Lismore&quot; is currently owned by University College Cork, where it is planned to be displayed, and the Lismore Crozier is in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.

The medieval Lismore Cathedral, dedicated to St Carthage, variously damaged and repaired over the centuries, is notable for its architecture and the stained glass window by the English pre Raphaelite artist, Edward Burne-Jones. It has been a place of worship since the 7th century but the current cathedral was constructed in the 17th century. Lismore Courthouse was completed in 1815.

St Carthage&#x27;s Church in the town is a Roman Catholic church also dedicated to St Carthage. It was opened in 1884 and has operated as a Roman Catholic church since.

A plaque was erected in the town to commemorate the regular visits made to Lismore by Fred Astaire following an association developed by his sister, Adele Astaire, who was married to Lord Charles Arthur Francis Cavendish, son of Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire. A notable resident born in the town who has described her early life in Lismore, is the travel writer and world touring cyclist, Dervla Murphy. Another notable resident was George O&#x27;Brien, the Irish memoirist, writer, and academic, who was raised by his paternal grandmother in Lismore, described in his memoir &quot;The Village of Longing: An Irish Boyhood in the Fifties&quot; (1987).

In September 2003, Blackwater Community School opened as an amalgamation of three local schools: Lismore CBS, Presentation Convent, Lismore and St Anne&#x27;s Secondary School, Cappoquin.

==Location==
Lismore is in the west of County Waterford, where the N72 road crosses the River Blackwater at the foot of the Knockmealdown Mountains (Irish: &quot;Sléibhte Chnoc Mhaoldomhnaigh&quot;), the mountain range which divides the counties of Tipperary and Waterford.

In the other direction there are four services to and from Tallow where connections can be made for Fermoy. On Saturdays, a local bus company operate a service to Cork.

<doc id="985871" wikidata="Q639614" url="?curid=985871" title="Ardmore, County Waterford">
<text>Ardmore () is a seaside resort and fishing village in County Waterford, Ireland, not far from Youghal on the south coast of Ireland. The village is in a civil parish of the same name. As of the 2022 census, the village had a population of 468. Ardmore is believed to be the oldest Christian settlement in Ireland. According to tradition, Saint Declan lived in the region in the early 5th century, and Christianised the area before the coming of Saint Patrick.

In September 2014, Ardmore was included on a shortlist of Ireland&#x27;s top tourist towns composed by Fáilte Ireland. It is home to the Michelin-starred restaurant, The House, at the Cliff House Hotel.

==History==
===Ecclesiastical history===

Ardmore is associated with a 5th century saint, Declán of Ardmore, who is reputed to have founded a monastery in the area. Declan, regarded as a patron saint of the Déisi of East Munster, is one of several Munster saints said to have preceded Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity to Ireland. A new church, replacing an older oratory, was built at St. Declan&#x27;s Monastery in the 9th century.

At the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111, recognition was given to the Diocese of Ardmore. A bishop of Ardmore swore fealty to Henry II of England at Cashel, as a suffragan of its archbishop, in 1171. The last reference to an independent bishop of Ardmore dates to 1210, when Innocent III listed it as one of Cashel&#x27;s eleven suffragan dioceses.

No longer a residential bishopric, &quot;Árd Mór&quot; is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.
The parish, now called that of &#x27;Ardmore and Grange&#x27;, is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore. St. Paul&#x27;s, an old Church of Ireland church in the village, is part of the parish of Youghal.

===Ecclesiastical ruins===
On a hill above the village is a well-preserved 30-m-high, 12th-century round tower and the ruins of a cathedral dating from the 12th and 13th centuries with an adjacent 8th-century oratory. One of the outer walls of the cathedral features some stone carvings retrieved from an earlier 9th-century building. The carvings include a very early image of a harp, images of Adam and Eve in the garden and a representation of &quot;Solomon&#x27;s judgement&quot;. The cathedral also contains two Ogham stones, which rest in small alcoves. Some elements of the original structure can still be seen within the building. The present Church of Ireland church is close to this complex.

===Maritime history===
Within the last few decades, Ardmore has lost its status as a fishing village as fishing laws became more restrictive. Harbour development remains unfunded and larger fishing vessels are unable to utilise the present docking facilities due to a lack of water depth. However, a small number of fishermen maintain some of the old fishing practices as they continue to fish from Ardmore.

The &quot;Samson&quot;, a crane ship, was wrecked on Ram Head, near the village, during a December storm in 1987 as it was being towed from Liverpool to Malta. Its wreck is now a diving spot. There are many other older wrecks in the bay area including the &quot;Marechal de Noailles&quot;, &quot;Bandon&quot;, &quot;Peri&quot;, &quot;Scotland&quot;, &quot;Sextusa&quot; and &quot;Peg Tranton&quot;, and later wrecks including &quot;Anne Sophie&quot; and &quot;Fee des Ondes&quot;. The remaining keel of the latter wreck may still be seen at low tide on the main beach.

==Features==
The village includes two hotels, a number of pubs and restaurants, a seasonal petrol station, a pier and slipway, and one store. There are also several sports clubs and a primary school. The village was the overall winner of the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1992.

Ardmore is a seaside resort with a mile-long beach, commonly termed the Main Beach. Other nearby beaches include Goat Island, Ballyquin, the Curragh, and Whiting Bay. Ardmore&#x27;s main beach was awarded Blue Flag beach status in 2018. Improvements in water quality at the beach were attributed to a wastewater treatment plant which was opened in 2015. As of 2020, the beach retained its Blue Flag status.

In 2006 a new hotel, the Cliff House Hotel, was opened in place of the older Cliff Hotel. There is a cliff path, beginning near this hotel, and ending back in the main street. The cliff walk, which has marker posts erected along the route, passes an old remodeled Coastguard Station, St Declan&#x27;s Cell and Holy Well, a ruined church, the wreck of the &quot;Samson&quot;, an abandoned 20th century coast guard lookout, and another, much older, lookout tower. Further along the walk is a well with stone canopy, known as Fr. O&#x27;Donnells Well. The monastic complex is atop the hill above the village.

==Transport==
Ardmore is served on a daily basis by Bus Éireann route 260 which links it to, inter alia, Youghal, Midleton and Cork city. Until 2010 it was also served by route 362 which linked it to Waterford via Dungarvan.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Ardmore GAA. The area is also home to a watersports centre, an association football (soccer) club, and a juvenile athletics club.

This is the only division that is featured on NHK&#x27;s standard live coverage of sumo tournaments. The lower divisions are shown on their satellite coverage, with only the &quot;makuuchi&quot; broadcast having bilingual English commentary.

&quot;Makuuchi&quot; literally means &quot;inside the curtain&quot;, a reference to the early period of professional sumo, when there was a curtained-off area reserved for the top ranked wrestlers, to sit before appearing for their bouts.

Wrestlers are considered for promotion or demotion in rank before each grand tournament according to their performance in the one previous. Generally, a greater number of wins than losses (&quot;kachi-koshi&quot;) results in a promotion, and the reverse (&quot;make-koshi&quot;) results in demotion. There are stricter criteria for promotion to the top two ranks, which are also privileged when considered for demotion.

==Overview==
At the top fixed positions of the division are the &quot;titleholder&quot; or &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks of &quot;yokozuna&quot;, &quot;ōzeki&quot;, &quot;sekiwake&quot; and &quot;komusubi&quot;. There are typically 8–12 &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestlers, with the remainder, called &quot;maegashira&quot;, ranked in numerical order from 1 downwards.

 literally means &quot;the three ranks&quot;, even though it actually comprises four ranks. The discrepancy arose because the &quot;yokozuna&quot; was traditionally regarded as an &quot;ōzeki&quot; with a special license to wear a particular rope around his waist and perform a distinctive ring-entry ceremony. In modern use &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; has a somewhat flexible definition. This is largely because the top two ranks of &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot; have distinctive differences from the lower two ranks and from each other. Therefore, a reference to &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; can sometimes mean only the bottom three ranks, or in other cases only &quot;sekiwake&quot; and &quot;komusubi&quot;.

There must be at least one &quot;sekiwake&quot; and &quot;komusubi&quot; on each side of the &quot;banzuke&quot;, normally two total, but there may be more. Although there is usually a &quot;yokozuna&quot; there is no requirement for one, and it has sometimes happened that no active &quot;yokozuna&quot; or no &quot;ōzeki&quot; were listed in the ranks. If there is more than one &quot;yokozuna&quot; but only one &quot;ōzeki&quot;, the lower rank will be filled out by designating one of the &quot;yokozuna&quot; as &quot;yokozuna-ōzeki&quot;. There is no recorded instance of there being fewer than two &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot; in total.

There are a number of privileges and responsibilities associated with the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks. Any wrestler who reaches one of them is entitled to purchase one of the membership shares in the Japan Sumo Association, regardless of the total number of tournaments they have spent in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division. They may be called on to represent all sumo wrestlers on certain occasions. For example, when the president of the Sumo Association makes a formal speech on the opening and closing days of a tournament, he is flanked by all the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestlers in their &quot;mawashi&quot;. Similarly they may be called to assist in welcoming a VIP, such as the Emperor, to the arena.

The &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; can be split into two groups: The senior &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot;, and junior &quot;sekiwake&quot; and &quot;komusubi&quot;.

The former group have special promotion criteria and higher salaries, and have additional perks such as a higher number of junior wrestlers to assist them, an entitlement to park in the Sumo Association compound and voting rights in the election for Association directors. Senior &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot; also have added responsibilities. They are expected to represent wrestler views to the Association, assist in advertising events and meet event sponsors.

The latter group, &quot;sekiwake&quot; and &quot;komusubi&quot;, have lesser responsibilities and are still eligible for one of the three special prizes, or &quot;sanshō&quot; that are awarded for exceptional performance at the end of each tournament.

==&quot;Yokozuna&quot;==


 is the highest rank in sumo. The name literally means &quot;horizontal rope&quot; and comes from the most visible symbol of their rank, the worn around the waist. The rope is similar to the &quot;shimenawa&quot; used to mark off sacred areas in Shinto, and like the &quot;shimenawa&quot; it serves to purify and mark off its content. The rope, which may weigh up to , is not used during the matches themselves, but is worn during the &quot;yokozuna&quot; &quot;dohyō-iri&quot; ring entrance ceremony.

As of January 2025, a total of 74 sumo wrestlers have earned the rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot;; considering that formal record-keeping only began with Tanikaze Kajinosuke and Onogawa Kisaburo in 1789, this roughly averages out to one every three years.

===History===

There are two competing legends regarding the origin of the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank. According to one, a 9th-century wrestler named Hajikami tied a &quot;shimenawa&quot; around his waist as a handicap and dared anyone to touch it, creating sumo as it is now known in the process. According to the other, legendary wrestler Akashi Shiganosuke tied the &quot;shimenawa&quot; around his waist in 1630 as a sign of respect when visiting the Emperor, and was posthumously awarded the title for the first time. There is little supporting evidence for either theory—in fact, it is not even certain that Akashi actually existed—but it is known that by November 1789, &quot;yokozuna&quot; starting from the fourth &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Tanikaze Kajinosuke, and the fifth &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Onogawa Kisaburō, were depicted in ukiyo-e prints as wearing the &quot;shimenawa&quot;. These two wrestlers were both awarded &quot;yokozuna&quot; licences by the prominent Yoshida family.

Before the Meiji Era, the title &quot;yokozuna&quot; was conferred on &quot;ōzeki&quot; who performed sumo in front of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. This privilege was more often determined by a wrestler&#x27;s patron having sufficient influence rather than purely on the ability and dignity of the wrestler. Thus, there are a number of early wrestlers who were, by modern standards, &quot;yokozuna&quot; in name only. In these early days, &quot;yokozuna&quot; was also not regarded as a separate rank in the listings, but as an &quot;ōzeki&quot; with special dispensation to perform his own ring entering ceremony.

At first, the Yoshida family and a rival family, Gojo, fought for the right to award a wrestler a &quot;yokozuna&quot; licence. The Yoshida family won this dispute, because the 15th &quot;yokozuna&quot; Umegatani Tōtarō I, one of the strongest wrestlers, expressed his wish that he be awarded a licence by the Yoshida family in February 1884, and Gojo licences are no longer recognized officially.

In May 1890, the name &quot;yokozuna&quot; was written on the &quot;banzuke&quot; for the first time due to the 16th &quot;yokozuna&quot; Nishinoumi Kajirō I&#x27;s insistence that his &quot;yokozuna&quot; status be recorded. In February 1909, during the reigns of the 19th &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Hitachiyama Taniemon, and the 20th, Umegatani Tōtarō II, it was officially recognized as the highest rank. Since the establishment of the on 21 April 1950, wrestlers have been promoted to &quot;yokozuna&quot; by the Japan Sumo Association. The first &quot;yokozuna&quot; promoted by the Sumo Association was the 41st &quot;yokozuna&quot; Chiyonoyama Masanobu.

===Criteria for promotion===
In modern sumo, the qualifications that an &quot;ōzeki&quot; must satisfy to be promoted are that he has enough power, skill and dignity/grace (品格 &quot;hinkaku&quot;) to qualify. There are no absolute criteria, nor is there a set quota: there have been periods with no wrestlers at &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank, and there have been periods with as many as four simultaneously.

The power and skill aspects are usually considered with reference to recent tournament performance. The &quot;de facto&quot; standard is to win two consecutive championships as &quot;ōzeki&quot; or an equivalent performance. In the case where the &quot;equivalent performance&quot; criterion is used, the wrestler&#x27;s record over the previous three tournaments is taken into account with an expectation of at least one tournament victory and one runner-up performance, with none of the three records falling below twelve wins. Thus, a consistent high level of performance is required. Winning two tournaments with a poor performance between them is not usually sufficient. Also, achieving runner-up performance in three consecutive tournaments is not sufficient: an example is Ozeki Kisenosato in 2013 and 2016. The rules are not set in stone; hence, in reaching their conclusion the Yokozuna Deliberation Council and Sumo Association can interpret the criteria more leniently or strictly and also take into account other factors, such as total number of tournament victories, the quality of the wins, and whether the losses show any serious vulnerabilities.

The issue of &quot;hinkaku&quot; (dignity and grace) is more contentious, as it is essentially a subjective issue. For example, Hawaiian-born &quot;ōzeki&quot; Konishiki, in particular, was felt by many to be unfairly kept from &quot;yokozuna&quot; status due to his non-Japanese origin, and many Sumo Association members even openly said that foreigners (&quot;gaijin&quot;) could never achieve the &quot;hinkaku&quot; needed to be a &quot;yokozuna&quot;. In the case of Konishiki, other issues such as his weight were also cited. The debate concerning foreigners having the dignity to be a &quot;yokozuna&quot; was finally laid to rest on 27 January 1993, when Hawaiian-born &quot;ōzeki&quot; Akebono was formally promoted to &quot;yokozuna&quot; after only eight months as an &quot;ōzeki&quot;. Since then, the issue of whether foreigners have the necessary dignity has become irrelevant as seven of the ten wrestlers to achieve sumo&#x27;s ultimate rank following Akebono in 1993 were not born in Japan: Musashimaru in the United States and Asashōryū, Hakuhō, Harumafuji, Kakuryū, Terunofuji, and Hōshōryū all in Mongolia.

Other wrestlers have also been held back. For example, Chiyonoyama in the 1950s was not immediately promoted due to his relative youth despite winning consecutive tournaments, although he later achieved the top rank. On the other hand, Futahaguro was given the title of &quot;yokozuna&quot; in 1986, despite immaturity being cited in opposition to his promotion. After being promoted, he was involved in several misbehaviors that embarrassed the Sumo Association such as hitting one of his &quot;tsukebito&quot; (manservant or personal assistant) over a trivial matter in a scandal that had six of his seven &quot;tsukebito&quot; decide to leave him. The promotion again proved to be a fiasco when it was later revealed that he had a heated argument with his stable boss, Tatsunami, and stormed out of the &quot;heya&quot;, allegedly striking Tatsunami&#x27;s wife on the way. Futahaguro eventually retired after only one and a half years at the top rank and became the only &quot;yokozuna&quot; in sumo history ever to retire without having won at least one top division championship.

===Becoming===

Elevation to &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank is a multi-stage process. After a tournament, the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, a body of lay people (that is, not former sumo wrestlers) who are appointed by the Japan Sumo Association to provide an independent quality control on &quot;yokozuna&quot; promotion, meet and discuss the performance of the top-ranked wrestlers. Usually, at the instigation of the Japan Sumo Association, they can make a recommendation that a particular &quot;ōzeki&quot;-ranked wrestler has the necessary attributes to be promoted. Their recommendation is then passed to the Judging division and then the Board of Directors of the Sumo Association who make the final decision.

If a wrestler is deemed to have met the criteria, then he will be visited in his training stable by a member of the Sumo Association Board of Directors who will formally give him the news. In the following days, a &quot;tsuna&quot; or ceremonial rope will then be made in his stable, and he will practice the ring entrance ceremony with advice from a previous or current &quot;yokozuna&quot;. Finally, he will have his inaugural ceremonial ring entry ceremony held at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, which is usually completed within a couple of weeks of the tournament end.

===Retiring===
As opposed to all other sumo ranks, a &quot;yokozuna&quot; cannot be demoted, but in exchange for this privilege, expectations are set very high for &quot;yokozuna&quot; where they are expected to win or at least be a serious contender for championships on a regular basis. A &quot;yokozuna&quot; is expected to retire if he can no longer compete at the peak of the sport, or in some cases (such as Futahaguro, Asashōryū, or Harumafuji) is deemed to have not upheld the dignity of the rank. Expectations are so high that, even in the course of one tournament, a &quot;yokozuna&quot; who early on appears to be headed for a losing tournament will feel the pressure to retire. It is common and expected for a &quot;yokozuna&quot; to withdraw from a tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a &quot;make-koshi&quot; (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large part of the reason that the promotion criteria for &quot;yokozuna&quot; are so strict in the first place.

===Notices===
In extremely rare instances the Yokozuna Deliberation Council can, with over two-thirds of the members in favor, issue notices to &quot;yokozuna&quot; whose performance as well as poise and character are contrary to what is expected of the rank. These notices are, in increasing level of severity:
*

Notices have been issued three times since the council&#x27;s inception in 1950:

* January 2010: Recommendation to Retire issued to Asashōryū.The recommendation was issued following allegations that Asashōryū punched and injured an acquaintance in a drunken brawl at a nightclub during the January 2010 tournament. It has been suggested in the media that Asashōryū chose to retire before the Sumo Association could follow through on the council&#x27;s recommendation.
* November 2018: Encouragement issued to Kisenosato.Kisenosato lost his first five matches in the November 2018 tournament before withdrawing. Prior to that, he had withdrawn (either partially or fully) without a winning record in eight out of ten tournaments as &quot;yokozuna&quot;. The withdrawals were due in part to injuries suffered at the end of his winning tournament run in March 2017. He eventually retired from the sport after three consecutive defeats in the January 2019 &quot;basho&quot;.
* November 2020: Warning issued to two &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Hakuhō and Kakuryū.According to the council, both wrestlers did not perform to the level required of the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank between November 2019 and November 2020. In that timeframe, Hakuhō sufficiently performed three times (&quot;yūshō&quot; in November 2019 and March 2020, plus a 10-win performance in July 2020) while Kakuryū sufficiently performed just once (runner-up in March 2020 with 12 wins). Both of them sat out of the September 2020 and November 2020 tournaments due to injury.The warning to Hakuhō and Kakuryū was upheld in March 2021. Kakuryū sat out for two additional tournaments since the warning was first issued, eventually retiring during the March 2021 &quot;basho&quot;. After sitting out of the January 2021 tournament due to COVID-19, Hakuhō won two matches in March before withdrawing when doctors told him that he would require kneecap surgery.

===&quot;Yokozuna&quot; ceremonies and traditions===
The formal establishment of the rank from Tanikaze&#x27;s time appears to have in part come from a desire to let the very best have a separate ring entry ceremony (&quot;dohyō-iri&quot;) from the remaining top division wrestlers. The &quot;dohyō-iri&quot; is a ceremonial presentation of all the top-division wrestlers that is held before the competitive bouts of the day. The normal ceremony for top-division wrestlers is to be introduced and form a circle around the wrestling ring (&quot;dohyō&quot;) wearing specially decorated heavy silk &quot;aprons&quot;, called &quot;keshō-mawashi&quot;. A brief symbolic &quot;dance&quot; is carried out before filing off to change into their fighting &quot;mawashi&quot; and prepare for their bouts.

A &quot;yokozuna&quot;, however, is introduced after the lower-ranked wrestlers and is flanked by two other top-division wrestler &quot;assistants&quot;. The &quot;dewsweeper&quot; or &quot;tsuyuharai&quot; precedes the &quot;yokozuna&quot;, while the &quot;sword bearer&quot; or &quot;tachimochi&quot; follows him into the arena. The sword is a Japanese katana and symbolises the samurai status of the &quot;yokozuna&quot;. The &quot;tachimochi&quot; will always be the more highly ranked of the assisting wrestlers. As indicated above, during the ceremony the &quot;yokozuna&quot; will wear his &quot;tsuna&quot; around his waist. The ceremonial aprons of all three form a matching set.

Once in the ring, the &quot;yokozuna&quot; takes centre stage and performs a much more complex ritual dance. The dance can take one of two forms, one of which the &quot;yokozuna&quot; usually chooses when he is first promoted. In addition to the slightly different routine, the choice of the &quot;yokozuna&quot;&#x27;s ritual can also be determined by the knot used to tie the rope around his waist: the &quot;Unryū&quot; style has only one loop at the back, while the &quot;Shiranui&quot; style has two. The styles are named after 10th &quot;yokozuna&quot; Unryū Kyūkichi and 11th &quot;yokozuna&quot; Shiranui Kōemon of the Edo period, although there is no historical proof that they actually carried out the dances that have been attributed to them. Indeed, some scholars believe that earlier historians have confused the ring-entering rituals of these two &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

When a former &quot;yokozuna&quot; reaches the age of 60, he usually performs a special ring-entering ceremony known as &quot;kanreki dohyō-iri&quot;, wearing a red &quot;tsuna&quot;, in celebration of his longevity. This ceremony first took place with the former &quot;yokozuna&quot; Tachiyama in 1937.

===Active &quot;yokozuna&quot;===
* Hōshōryū, the 74th yokozuna, from Mongolia, promoted January 2025

==&quot;Ōzeki&quot;==

The &quot;ōzeki&quot; , or champion rank, is immediately below &quot;yokozuna&quot; in the ranking system. Until the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank was introduced, &quot;ōzeki&quot; was the highest rank attainable. Technically, there must always be a minimum of two &quot;ōzeki&quot; on the &quot;banzuke&quot;, one on the east side and one on the west. If there are fewer than two regular &quot;ōzeki&quot; in practice, then one or more &quot;yokozuna&quot; will be designated &quot;yokozuna-ōzeki&quot;. This was seen for five tournaments from May 1981 to January 1982, when three &quot;yokozuna&quot; (Wakanohana, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi) fulfilled this role at various times. The designation would not be used again until the March 2020 &quot;banzuke&quot;, when only Takakeishō held the &quot;ōzeki&quot; rank and Kakuryū was designated &quot;yokozuna-ōzeki&quot;. In the first three tournaments of 2023, Takakeishō again was the only &quot;ōzeki&quot; and the &quot;yokozuna-ōzeki&quot; designation was given to Terunofuji. There is no limit to the number of &quot;ōzeki&quot;. In 2012, there were six &quot;ōzeki&quot; in the May, July, and September tournaments.

===Promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;===

The promotion of a wrestler to &quot;ōzeki&quot; is a multi-tournament process. A wrestler at the rank of &quot;sekiwake&quot; will be considered for promotion if he has achieved a total of at least 33 wins over the three most recent tournaments, including ten or more wins in the tournament just completed. Promotion is discretionary and there are no hard-and-fast rules, though a three-tournament record of 33 wins is considered a near-guarantee. Other factors toward promotion will include tangibles such as winning a tournament or defeating &quot;yokozuna&quot;, as well as the wrestler&#x27;s overall consistency, prowess, and quality of sumo—for example, a record of illegal maneuvers or reliance on certain dodging techniques would count against the dignity expected of an &quot;ōzeki&quot;.

Promotions are recommended by the Judging Division to the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association. If it is a first promotion to the rank, a member of the Board of Directors will formally visit the wrestler&#x27;s stable to inform the new &quot;ōzeki&quot; of his promotion. The &quot;ōzeki&quot; will usually make a speech on this occasion, promising to do his best to uphold the dignity of the rank.

During the Edo period, wrestlers often made their debuts as &quot;ōzeki&quot; based on size alone, though their real competitiveness had not been tested. The system was called &quot;guest ōzeki&quot; (). Most of these vanished from the &quot;banzuke&quot; soon after, but a few wrestlers, notably Tanikaze Kajinosuke, remained as real wrestlers.

===Demotion from &quot;ōzeki&quot;===

Like the other &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks, but unlike a &quot;yokozuna&quot;, an &quot;ōzeki&quot; may be relegated. For an &quot;ōzeki&quot;, relegation is a two-step procedure. First, the &quot;ōzeki&quot; must have a losing record in a tournament (7-8 or worse), known as a &quot;make-koshi&quot;. At this point, the &quot;ōzeki&quot; is called &quot;kadoban&quot;. If he makes a winning record (8-7 or better) in the next tournament (which is called &quot;kachi-koshi&quot;), he is restored to regular &quot;ōzeki&quot; status. If, on the other hand, he suffers another losing record in the next tournament while &quot;kadoban&quot;, he is relegated to &quot;sekiwake&quot; in the following tournament. (No matter how badly he does, he will not fall lower than &quot;sekiwake&quot;.)

If he wins ten or more bouts in this tournament, he is restored to &quot;ōzeki&quot; for the following tournament. However, if he fails to win ten or more bouts, he is treated just like any other wrestler in any further attempts at being promoted back to &quot;ōzeki&quot;. This system has been in place since the Nagoya Tournament of 1969. Since that time, six wrestlers have managed an immediate return to &quot;ōzeki&quot;: Mienoumi, Takanonami, Musōyama, Tochiazuma (who managed it on two occasions), Tochinoshin and Takakeishō.

Mitakeumi is the only wrestler to be demoted from &quot;ōzeki&quot; after three consecutive losing records instead of two. He entered the July 2022 &quot;basho&quot; at &quot;kadoban&quot; status, but withdrew in the middle of the tournament after a stablemate tested positive for COVID-19. Under the Sumo Association&#x27;s COVID protocols at the time, Mitakeumi&#x27;s &quot;ōzeki&quot; rank and &quot;kadoban&quot; status were extended to the following tournament in September, where he sustained another losing record and was subsequently demoted.

===Benefits of being an &quot;ōzeki&quot;===

In addition to a salary increase, there are a number of perks associated with reaching &quot;ōzeki&quot; rank:
*He is guaranteed a higher rank in the Sumo Association when he first retires.
*He will be given a three-year temporary membership of the Sumo Association on his retirement if he does not yet own a share.
*He will receive a special merit payment on his retirement (the amount decided by his strength and longevity as an &quot;ōzeki&quot;).
*He is given a parking space at the Sumo Association headquarters.
*He can vote in the election of the Sumo Association directors.
*Normally, he will receive additional support from his stable in terms of junior wrestlers to act as his manservants.
*He can wear purple fringed ceremonial aprons (&quot;keshō-mawashi&quot;)
*He may be called on to represent the wrestlers on formal occasions such as when VIPs visit a sumo tournament, or on formal visits to Shinto shrines.

==&quot;Sekiwake&quot;==

 is the third-highest rank in professional sumo wrestling, and is one of the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks. The term is believed to derive from guarding the &quot;ōzeki&quot; (大関 or 関) at his side (脇).

It represents the highest rank a wrestler can achieve by continuously making a &quot;kachi-koshi&quot; (a winning record in the tournament) in tournaments. Promotion to &quot;sekiwake&quot; depends on either a space being available, which is quite common, or having a record in the previous tournament that is very convincing. Typically 11–4 or better as a &quot;komusubi&quot; is sufficient for promotion to &quot;sekiwake&quot; even with no normal space available; lower ranks need progressively more wins. There are special promotion criteria, typically a minimum of 33 wins over three tournaments, for advancement from &quot;sekiwake&quot; to &quot;ōzeki&quot;; merely recording consecutive winning records while at the &quot;sekiwake&quot; rank is not enough to advance. In the 1980s, Sakahoko stayed at &quot;sekiwake&quot; for nine consecutive tournaments without even getting close to &quot;ōzeki&quot; consideration, and Goeidō was stuck at the rank for fourteen consecutive tournaments, a modern-day record, between May 2012 and July 2014, before being promoted to &quot;ōzeki&quot; in September 2014.

Unlike the higher ranks of &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot;, a wrestler will nearly always lose the rank immediately after having a &quot;make-koshi&quot; tournament (a losing record during a tournament). Very occasionally, however, a lucky &quot;sekiwake&quot; might keep his rank even with a 7–8 record if there are no obvious candidates to replace him, as when the &quot;komusubi&quot; and the upper &quot;maegashira&quot; have also had losing records. This has happened five times since the six-tournaments-a-year era began in 1958, most recently with Gōeidō in July 2013. In each case, the wrestler was merely moved from the &quot;sekiwake&quot; East rank to the less prestigious West side.

For many purposes, &quot;sekiwake&quot; and the &quot;komusubi&quot; rank are treated together as the junior &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks, as opposed to &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot;. For example, records of number of tournaments ranked in junior &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; are often referred to in sumo publications.

For wrestlers reaching this rank, the benefits are similar to that for a &quot;komusubi&quot;. The salary is higher than for a &quot;maegashira&quot; and also the wrestler is usually called to appear to flank the chairman of the Sumo Association during the speeches he makes on opening and closing days of the 15-day tournaments that are held six times a year. He may also be called on to represent the wrestlers on behalf of the Sumo Association at other events, especially if the number of &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot; is low. If this is the highest rank a wrestler reaches, even if it is only for one tournament, he will always be referred to as &quot;former sekiwake (ring name)&quot; after his retirement, an indicator of a successful sumo career, even if not achieving the exceptional standards of the two highest ranks.

At any time, there must be a minimum of two wrestlers ranked at &quot;sekiwake&quot;. If circumstances require, this can rise typically to three or four. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers leaves no obvious candidates to fill the rank. This luck factor is less common than it is for &quot;komusubi&quot; promotions.

===Wrestlers with most &quot;sekiwake&quot; appearances in history===
&quot;Names in bold indicate a still active wrestler.&quot;

==&quot;Komusubi&quot;==
 literally means &quot;the little knot&quot;, the knot referring to the match-up between two wrestlers. It is the fourth highest rank in sumo wrestling and is the lowest of the so-called titleholder ranks, or &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot;.

At &quot;komusubi&quot;, achieving a &quot;kachi-koshi&quot; (winning record in a tournament) is not sufficient to guarantee promotion to a higher rank. Promotion to the next highest rank, &quot;sekiwake&quot;, depends on either a space being available, which is quite common, or having at least 11 wins in the previous tournament if no normal &quot;sekiwake&quot; slot is available. This general requirement can be seen by the promotion of Tochiōzan to a third &quot;sekiwake&quot; slot for March 2014 with 11 wins when the other two &quot;sekiwake&quot; had winning records, while Tochinoshin was not promoted with 10 wins for November 2015 in a similar situation.

For many purposes, this and the &quot;sekiwake&quot; rank are treated together as the junior &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks, as opposed to &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot;, where extremely stringent promotion criteria exist. Records of number of tournaments ranked in junior &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; are often referred to in sumo publications because these two ranks are so difficult to retain.

For wrestlers reaching this rank, the benefits are a salary increase and also appearing to flank the chairman of the Sumo Association during the speeches he makes on opening and closing days of the official tournaments, held six times a year. He may also be called on to represent the wrestlers on behalf of the Sumo Association at other events, especially if the number of &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot; are low. If this is the highest rank a wrestler reaches, even if it is only for one tournament, he will always be referred to as &quot;former &quot;komusubi&quot; (ring name)&quot; after his retirement, which is an indicator of a fairly successful sumo career.

At any time, there must be a minimum of two wrestlers ranked as &quot;komusubi&quot;. If circumstances require this can rise to three or four, for example if both &quot;komusubi&quot; have winning records and an upper &quot;maegashira&quot; produces such a good score that he cannot reasonably be denied a promotion. However, this is relatively rare. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers leaves no obvious candidates to fill the rank.

&quot;Komusubi&quot; is widely regarded as a difficult rank to maintain, as wrestlers at this rank are likely to face all the &quot;ōzeki&quot; and&quot; yokozuna&quot; in the first week of a tournament, with a &quot;yokozuna&quot; normally scheduled for the opening day. &quot;Komusubi&quot; face mainly &quot;maegashira&quot; in the second week, but often wrestlers new to the rank are so demoralised by this point that they lose these matches too. Few men making their &quot;komusubi&quot; debut return a &quot;kachi-koshi&quot; or winning record in the ensuing tournament.

Before World War II, when there were fewer tournaments per year and more weight was placed on the performance at each tournament, there were several instances of &quot;komusubi&quot; immediately advancing to &quot;ōzeki&quot; after nearly winning a tournament, but there have been no instances of this since then.

==&quot;Maegashira&quot;==
Maegashira (前頭) is the lowest of five ranks in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division.

All the &quot;makuuchi&quot; wrestlers who are not ranked in &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; are ranked as &quot;maegashira&quot;, numbered from one at the top downwards. In each rank there are two wrestlers, the higher ranked is designated as &quot;east&quot; and the lower as &quot;west&quot;, so No. 1 east is treated as a higher rank than No. 1 west, and so on.

The number of wrestlers in &quot;makuuchi&quot; is fixed (at 42 since 2004) but the number in &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; is not. Thus, the number of &quot;maegashira&quot; ranks can vary, but is typically between 15 and 17. (This gives a &quot;makuuchi&quot; division split of around 10 &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; and 32 &quot;maegashira&quot;).

Movement within the &quot;maegashira&quot; ranks can be minor or extreme, depending on a wrestler&#x27;s score in the previous 15-bout tournament. For example, a &quot;maegashira&quot; 2 who has an 8–7 record might only be promoted one level to &quot;maegashira&quot; 1 for the next tournament. Conversely, a &quot;maegashira&quot; 14 who wins the division championship could be promoted as high as &quot;komusubi&quot;. Indeed, this happened in March 2000 when Takatōriki of the Futagoyama stable won the championship with a 13–2 record.

&quot;Maegashira&quot; ranked five or below are likely to only fight amongst themselves (unless their winning record in the middle of a tournament prompts their scheduling with higher-ranked wrestlers) while those ranked &quot;maegashira&quot; four or above are likely to have several matches against &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestlers, including &quot;ōzeki&quot; and &quot;yokozuna&quot;. Wrestlers at &quot;maegashira&quot; 1 and 2 will usually face everybody in the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; (with the exception that you cannot face someone from your own stable), and these are therefore considered very difficult ranks to maintain. If a lower-ranked &quot;maegashira&quot; has a score which puts them in contention for the title in the second week of the tournament, it is not uncommon for them to be matched against higher-ranked opponents later in the &quot;basho&quot;; for instance, in January 2020, the lowest-ranked wrestler in the tournament, &quot;maegashira&quot; 17 Tokushōryū, was in contention for the title having only faced opponents in the lower half of the &quot;banzuke&quot; and was matched against &quot;ōzeki&quot;
Takakeisho, the highest-ranked &quot;rikishi&quot; participating in the tournament, on the final day, clinching the &quot;basho&quot; with his victory.

When a &quot;maegashira&quot; defeats a &quot;yokozuna&quot;, it is called a gold star or &quot;kinboshi&quot; and he is rewarded monetarily for the victory for the remainder of his career. A bout where a wrestler earns a &quot;kinboshi&quot; defeat of a &quot;yokozuna&quot; generally causes great excitement at a sumo venue and it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers) after such a bout, though this is technically prohibited.
