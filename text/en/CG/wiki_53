<text>A.E.K. Football Club (), known simply as A.E.K. (; ) in Greece and AEK Athens internationally, is a Greek professional football club based in Nea Filadelfeia, Attica, Greece.

Established in Athens by Greek refugees from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), AEK is one of the most successful teams in Greek football, by winning 32 national titles it is the only club to have won all the competitions organised by the Hellenic Football Federation (13 Greek Championships, 16 Greek Cups, 1 League Cup and 2 Super Cups).

The club has appeared several times in European competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the defunct UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup). It is the only Greek team to have advanced to 
the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (1976-77) and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup twice (1996-97 and 1997-98).

AEK was also the first Greek team to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup (1968–69) and to qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League (1994-95).

==History==
===Establishment and early years (1924–1944)===
The large Greek population of Constantinople, not unlike that of the other Ottoman urban centres, continued its athletic traditions in the form of numerous athletic clubs. Clubs such as Énosis Tatávlon () and Iraklís () from the Tatavla district, Mégas Aléxandros () and Ermís () of Galata, and Olympiás () of Therapia existed to promote Hellenic athletic and cultural ideals. These were amongst a dozen Greek-backed clubs that dominated the sporting landscape of the city in the years preceding World War I. After the war, with the influx of mainly French and British soldiers to Constantinople, many of the city&#x27;s clubs participated in regular competitions with teams formed by foreign troops. Taxim, Pera, and Tatavla became the scene of weekly competitions in not only football, but also athletics, cycling, boxing, and tennis.

Football in the city was dominated by Énosis Tatávlon and Ermís. Ermís, one of the most popular sports clubs, was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera (Galata). Known as &quot;Pera&quot; since the mid-1880s, and &quot;The Greek Football Team&quot; when its football department was formed in 1914, it was forced to change its name to &quot;Pera Sports Club&quot;, and then &quot;Beyoğluspor Kulübü&quot; in 1923. Many of its athletes, and those of most other sporting clubs, fled during the population exchanges at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, settling in Athens and Thessaloniki.

The founders of AEK – a group of Constantinopolitan refugees (among them former athletes from the Pera Sports Club and the other Constantinopolitan clubs) – met at the athletic shop &quot;Lux&quot; owned by Emilios Ionas and Konstantinos Dimopoulos on Veranzerou Street, in the centre of Athens, and created AEK. Their intention was to create a club that provided athletic and cultural diversions for the thousands of predominantly Constantinopolitan and Anatolian refugees who had settled in the new suburbs of Athens (including Nea Filadelfeia, Nea Ionia, Nea Chalkidona, Nea Smyrni).

The first AEK team was: &quot;GK: Kitsos, DF: Ieremiadis, DF: Asderis, MF: Kechagias, MF: Paraskevas, MF: Dimopoulos, MF: Karagiannides, FW: Baltas, FW: Milas, FW: Iliades, and FW: Georgiades&quot;. AEK played their first match against &quot;Aias Athinon&quot; in November 1924, winning by 2–0.

AEK&#x27;s football team grew rapidly in popularity during the 1920s, eclipsing the already-established Athens-based refugee clubs (Panionios, Apollon Smyrnis, etc.), thanks mainly to the large pool of immigrants that were drawn to the club, the significance of the name &quot;Constantinople&quot; for many refugees and Greeks, plus, in no small part, to the political connections and wealth of several of the club&#x27;s board members. Not possessing a football ground, AEK played most of its early matches at various locations around Athens, including the grounds of the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium.

AEK&#x27;s first president, Konstantinos Spanoudis (1871–1941), a journalist and associate of the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, petitioned the government to set aside land for the establishment of a sports ground. In 1926, land in Nea Filadelfeia, which was originally set aside for refugee housing, was donated as a training ground for the refugees&#x27; sports activities. AEK began using the ground for training, albeit unofficially.

In 1928, Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, and AEK began a dispute with the fledgling Hellenic Football Federation (EPO), decided to break away from the Athens regional league, and formed an alliance called POK. During the dispute, POK organised friendly matches against each other and several continental European clubs. In 1929, though, the dispute ended and AEK, along with the other POK clubs, entered the EPO fold once again.

In 1930, the property where AEK trained was officially signed over to the club. Venizelos soon approved the plans to build what was to become AEK&#x27;s home ground for the next 70 years, the AEK Stadium. The first home game, in November 1930, was an exhibition match against Olympiacos that ended in a 2–2 draw.

In 1932, AEK won their first Greek Cup title, beating Aris 5–3 in the final. The team boasted a number of star football players like Kostas Negrepontis (a veteran of the original Pera Club of Constantinople), Kleanthis Maropoulos, Tryfon Tzanetis, Michalis Delavinias, Giorgos Mageiras and Spyros Sklavounos.

The club&#x27;s mixed success during the 1930s was highlighted by the first Greek Championship and Greek Cup (winning the double) in 1939. Under former player Kostas Negrepontis as head coach, AEK also won the Greek Championship of 1940.

===1960–1974: Nestoridis-Papaioannou era===

With Kostas Nestoridis scoring goals in the early 1960s (top goalscorer for 5 seasons in row, from 1958 to 1963), and the timely signing of attacker Mimis Papaioannou (the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and record appearance maker) in 1962, AEK went on to win the 1962–63 championship. Known affectionately as &quot;Mimis&quot; by the AEK supporters, Papaioannou scored twice in the 1963 playoff against Panathinaikos, leveling the score at 3–3 and giving AEK its first post-war championship on goal aggregate. Coached by Hungarian-German Jenő Csaknády, the championship team also consisted of Stelios Serafidis, Miltos Papapostolou, and Andreas Stamatiadis. Youngsters like Alekos Sofianidis, Stelios Skevofilakas, Giorgos Petridis, and Manolis Kanellopoulos played a significant role in the victorious 1963 campaign.

The club followed up with Cup victories in 1964 and 1966. With the return of Csaknády to the coach&#x27;s position in 1968 and the addition of some great players like Kostas Nikolaidis, Giorgos Karafeskos, Panagiotis Ventouris, Fotis Balopoulos, Spyros Pomonis, Alekos Iordanou, Nikos Stathopoulos and Andreas Papaemmanouil, AEK easily won the 1967–68 championship.

====European Champions Cup quarter-finalists====
In the 1968–69 season AEK, under Yugoslav coach Branko Stanković, became the first Greek football club to reach the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup, but were eliminated by the Czechoslovakian Spartak Trnava.

The addition of goalkeeper Stelios Konstantinidis and Apostolos Toskas reinforced the team, and allowed AEK to take their fifth championship title in 1971.

===1974–81: The great AEK of Barlos===
Loukas Barlos, a successful industrialist, took over the presidency and financing of AEK in 1974, and with the help of coach František Fadrhonc built one of the finest teams in the club&#x27;s history. The Barlos &quot;Golden Era&quot; saw some of the greatest players ever to have played for AEK: Christos Ardizoglou, Giorgos Dedes, Giorgos Skrekis, the Germans Walter Wagner and Timo Zahnleiter, Dionysis Tsamis, Lakis Nikolaou, Petros Ravousis, Dušan Bajević, Takis Nikoloudis, Stefanos Theodoridis, Babis Intzoglou and Nikos Christidis.

====UEFA Cup semi-finalists====

Captained by Papaioannou in the 1976–1977 season, AEK reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup competition, the first Greek football club to do so. Beating Dynamo Moscow (Russia) 2–0, Derby County (England) 2–0 and 3–2, Red Star Belgrade (Yugoslavia) 2–0, and QPR (England) 3–0 and 7–6 on penalties, AEK were eventually eliminated by Gianni Agnelli&#x27;s Juventus. Juventus went on to win their first European title.

====Thomas Mavros: a goal-machine====

It was during this period that AEK signed one of Greece&#x27;s finest strikers, Thomas Mavros, the all-time top goalscorer in the Greek Championship. In the following years, he and Dušan Bajević formed a formidable attacking duo for AEK. Mavros was an integral part of the team that reached the UEFA Cup semi-final in 1976, but it was his devastating form (top goalscorer in 1978 and 1979 – 22 and 31 goals, respectively) that helped AEK to win the 1977–78 Championship-Cup double. The addition of former Panathinaikos stars Domazos and Eleftherakis to the AEK squad the following year saw the club cap off their most successful decade to date by winning the 1979 Championship.

Under the leadership of Loukas Barlos, the Nikos Goumas Stadium was finally completed with the addition of the iconic &quot;covered stand&quot;, or &quot;Skepasti&quot; (), which eventually became home to the most fanatic of AEK supporter groups, &quot;Original 21&quot;. The next generation of star players, fresh out of AEK&#x27;s Academy, made their debut during this period: Stelios Manolas, Spyros Ikonomopoulos, Vangelis Vlachos, and Lysandros Georgamlis.

===1981–1999===
With new president Michalis Arkadis and Austrian head coach Helmut Senekowitsch, AEK won the 1983 Greek Cup, beating PAOK 2–0 in the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium. Thomas Mavros and Vangelis Vlachos were the goalscorers.

AEK also chased the elusive Championship title and it finally came in 1989. Coached by former player Dušan Bajević, AEK clinched the title after winning a crucial match 1–0 against Olympiacos at the Athens Olympic Stadium. Takis Karagiozopoulos scored the goal that gave AEK its first Championship after ten years. AEK won also the Greek Super Cup of 1989, beating Panathinaikos on penalties after the match ended in a 1–1 draw.

====Bajević golden team: Three consecutive championships====
After the 1989 triumphs, under Bajević, AEK built what was to become one of the most successful teams in its history. Captained by Stelios Manolas, the team, which included Toni Savevski, Daniel Batista, Vaios Karagiannis, Vasilis Dimitriadis, Giorgos Savvidis, Alexis Alexandris, Vasilios Tsiartas, Michalis Kasapis, Refik Šabanadžović and Vasilios Borbokis dominated the Greek league through the 1990s with three successive Championship titles (1992, 1993, and 1994). AEK won the only Greek League Cup ever organised in 1990 (beating Olympiacos 3–2).

====First Greek presence in the UEFA Champions League group stage====
In 1994–95, AEK became the first Greek football club to participate in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League after defeating Scottish champions Rangers; AEK were eliminated by Ajax and AC Milan, who made it to the final. With Michalis Trochanas as president and Dušan Bajević as coach, the club won the Greek Cup in 1996.

Former player Petros Ravousis took over the coaching position when Dušan Bajević left for Olympiacos at the end of 1996. Ravousis led the team to its second Super Cup in 1996, and its eleventh Cup title in 1997, beating Panathinaikos in both finals.

By far AEK&#x27;s most successful run with titles, the period also saw the club sign Temur Ketsbaia and several young, talented players like Demis Nikolaidis, Christos Kostis, Christos Maladenis and Akis Zikos. Nikolaidis, in particular, an AEK fan since childhood, declined more lucrative offers from Olympiacos and Panathinaikos to sign for his beloved club. During the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons, AEK progressed to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they were eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain and Lokomotiv Moscow.

In 1999, ex-president Dimitris Melissanidis organised a friendly match against Partizan in Belgrade, during the height of the NATO bombing of Serbia. As a gesture of compassion and solidarity towards the embattled Serbs, the AEK players and management staff defied the international embargo and traveled to Belgrade for the match. The game ended 1–1, when after 60 minutes thousands of Serbian football fans invaded the pitch to embrace the footballers.

===21st century===
AEK won its twelfth Cup title in 2000 under coach Giannis Pathiakakis, defeating Ionikos 3–0 in the final. The club continued its consistency in the Championship of 2001–02, finishing second on goal difference behind Olympiacos, and beating Olympiacos in the Greek Cup final.

====2002–03 UEFA Champions League unbeaten run====
Dušan Bajević returned as coach in the summer of 2002, a move that sparked open hostility towards Bajević from a section of AEK supporters. A strong team, called &quot;Dream Team&quot; by the fans, was created with players like Kostas Katsouranis, Ilija Ivić, Dionysis Chiotis, Vasilios Borbokis, Grigoris Georgatos, Theodoros Zagorakis, Walter Centeno, Michalis Kapsis, Michel Kreek, Vasilios Lakis, Vasilios Tsiartas (who returned from Sevilla), Ioannis Okkas, Nikos Liberopoulos and Demis Nikolaidis.

Under Bajević, AEK progressed through the qualifying rounds in the 2002 UEFA Champions League by eliminating APOEL. Drawn in Group A with AS Roma, Real Madrid, and Racing Genk, AEK with good performances drew all their games and were knocked out of the competition. They continued to UEFA Cup, eliminating Maccabi Haifa (4–0, 4–1) before being knocked out by Málaga CF.

Off the field, the presidency of Makis Psomiadis caused many problems for AEK, whose mismanagement put the club into debt. He was also accused of assaulting club captain Demis Nikolaidis and other players with the assistance of his bodyguards.

After the altercation, and partly due to the club&#x27;s growing financial problems, Nikolaidis left on a free transfer by mutual consent to Atlético Madrid. Unable to cope with the negativity from a large section of AEK fans, Bajević resigned in 2004 after a match against Iraklis.

====Demis Nikolaidis era====
In 2004, Demis Nikolaidis and other significant AEK followers formed a supporters&#x27; club Enosis 1924 (Union 1924) to motivate all AEK supporters into taking up the club&#x27;s shares and governance. The project was not fully realised because, in the meantime, various businessmen decided to buy shares and invest money in the club. However, to this date, Enosis 1924&#x27;s chairman is a member of the AEK FC board. The same year, Nikos Goumas Stadium, AEK&#x27;s home stadium for over 70 years, was demolished, large parts of it having been damaged by the 1999 Athens earthquake.


In 2004, on the back of strong AEK fan support, Nikolaidis, at the head of a consortium of businessmen, bought out the beleaguered club and became the new president. His primary task was to lead AEK out of its precarious financial position. The first success was an arrangement through the Greek judicial system to write off most of the massive debt that previous club administrators had amassed and to repay any remaining public debts in manageable installments.

Securing the club&#x27;s existence in the Alpha Ethniki, Nikolaidis then began a program to rebuild AEK to its former glory. He appointed experienced former player Ilija Ivić as technical director and brought back Fernando Santos as a coach. The AEK fans, emboldened by Nikolaidis&#x27; efforts, followed suit by buying season ticket packages in record numbers (over 17,000).

AEK recruited promising young players to strengthen a depleted team. Led by the experienced Katsouranis and Liberopoulos, and featuring Brazilian Júlio César, the club made it to the Greek Cup final for the seventh time in 13 years but finished second in the Championship, and in the process, secured a place in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. For the 2006–07 season, former Real Betis coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer was appointed to the coaching position after Fernando Santos&#x27; contract was not renewed.

By beating Hearts over both legs (2–1 in Scotland and 3–0 in Greece), AEK progressed to the group stage of the Champions League. The club obtained a total of 8 points, having beaten AC Milan 1–0, Lille 1–0, and managing two draws with Anderlecht (1–1 in Greece and 2–2 in Belgium). AEK finished second in the Greek Super League, qualifying again for the third round in the UEFA Champions League.

====2007–08 Championship controversy====

For the 2007–08 season AEK changed kit sponsors from Adidas to Puma. They played with Sevilla FC in the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. The first leg was played on 15 August, away at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, where AEK were defeated by 2 goals, and the second leg played on 3 September, at the Athens Olympic Stadium where AEK lost again by 1–4.

AEK completed the signings of Brazilian legend Rivaldo, after he was let free from Olympiacos, Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Charis Pappas, and Argentine striker Ismael Blanco. Traianos Dellas was rewarded with a new contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2009. On 25 August, the Super League and EPO decided to postpone the opening season&#x27;s games due to the fire disaster in the Peloponnese.

After being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League, AEK were drawn to play against FC Salzburg in the UEFA Cup. On 20 September, AEK claimed a home win over Salzburg by the scoreline of 3–0. In the second leg, played in Salzburg on 4 October, AEK lost the match but still went through 3–1 on aggregate. On 9 October, AEK were drawn in Group C in the UEFA Cup group stage along with Villarreal, Fiorentina, Mladá Boleslav, and Elfsborg. On 25 October, AEK kicked off the group stage with a 1–1 draw away to Elfsborg. On 29 November, AEK again drew 1–1, this time at home to Fiorentina. On 5 December, AEK won Mladá Boleslav 1–0 away and on 20 December, AEK were defeated at home with 1–2 by Villarreal, but finally booked a place in the knockout stage of the UEFA Cup by finishing third in the group. They were then drawn against Getafe in the third round (phase of 32). AEK advanced to the third round of the UEFA Cup for the second consecutive season.

On 12 February, AEK parted company with Lorenzo Serra Ferrer after a poor run of form and unsuccessful signings and replaced him with former player Nikos Kostenoglou, on a caretaker basis. The team initially finished in first place in the league, but after the court case between Apollon Kalamarias and Olympiacos for the illegal usage of a player in the 1–0 Apollon Kalamarias win earlier in the season, Olympiacos was awarded 3 points, thus finishing 2 points ahead of AEK.

President Demis Nikolaidis and several other managers and chairmen were angered with the court&#x27;s decision, stating that the Hellenic Football Federation knew about the usage of the illegal player prior to the game and had indeed issued a registration (blue card), but didn&#x27;t do anything about it. Panathinaikos also challenged the result at the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS) with no success, as the Hellenic Federation did not support the claim. Rivaldo had stated his intention to leave Greece if the ruling went in favour of Olympiacos and AEK were not declared champions. He stated, &quot;A team that was not good enough to win the title on the pitch does not deserve the trophy&quot;.

Giorgos Donis was appointed head coach of AEK on 14 May. His reign at the club did not go well. It began when AEK failed to defeat AC Omonia in the UEFA Cup second qualifying round, which meant their elimination from European competitions for the season. Rivaldo asked to leave the club to sign for Bunyodkor on 27 August.

The league campaign started very well after a win over rivals Panathinaikos in the opening game of the season, but poor performances and results from then on left AEK in a difficult situation. Head coach Donis was eager to leave the club, but president Nikolaidis did not allow him to leave. Nevertheless, Nikolaidis left due to disappointing results and after a controversy with the club&#x27;s supporters, Original 21, leaving the presidency temporarily to the members of the board of directors, Nikos Koulis, and Takis Kanellopoulos.

====Financial problems and relegation====

However, the series of disappointing results continued, bringing anger and insecure situations for everyone on the team. The first to be hit by this wave of disappointment and upset with the team council was coach Donis, who was asked to leave the team. On 21 November 2008, AEK hired Dušan Bajević as head coach for third time. However, after a while, Takis Kanellopoulos left the club, as he sparked a rivalry with Bajević.

On 4 February 2009, Nikos Thanopoulos was elected as the 41st president of AEK FC. Bajević brought some much-needed stability to the club, and performances on the pitch improved vastly towards the end of the season, culminating in AEK&#x27;s progression to the Greek Cup final against Olympiacos which was played on 2 May 2009, at Athens Olympic Stadium. AEK lost in the final 14–15 on penalties. AEK finished the regular season in fourth position, thus qualifying for the season&#x27;s playoffs, in which they eventually finished second, just missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification.

In the summer transfer period of 2010, AEK, despite being low on budget, managed to reinforce its ranks with many notable players. Club idols Nikos Liberopoulos and Traianos Dellas signed the last one-year contracts of their careers, and many new and experienced players signed to AEK, the most notable of whom were Papa Bouba Diop, Cristian Nasuti, and Christos Patsatzoglou. AEK qualified for the 2010–11 Europa League group stage after defeating Dundee United 2–1 on aggregate.

On 7 October 2010, Manolo Jiménez agreed to a two-year deal and took over for Bajević.

On 30 April 2011, AEK won the Greek Cup for the 14th time, defeating 3–0 Atromitos at the final.

To compensate for the departures of Nacho Scocco, Papa Bouba Diop, Sebastián Saja, and Ismael Blanco in the summer of 2011, AEK signed the captain of Iceland Eiður Guðjohnsen, and Colombian international Fabián Vargas. Due to financial problems, on 25 June 2012, AEK legend Thomas Mavros took over the club&#x27;s management and on 1 August 2012, became president in an effort to save the club from financial disaster. Many other former AEK players like Vasilis Tsiartas, Mimis Papaioannou, Kostas Nestoridis, Christos Kostis, Vangelis Vlachos, Christos Arvanitis, and Giorgos Karafeskos were hired to help the club return to its previous glory days. Due to bad results, on 30 September 2012, Vangelis Vlachos was fired and Ewald Lienen hired as AEK&#x27;s head coach. On 9 April 2013, Lienen was fired after disappointing results and AEK hired Traianos Dellas as head coach with Vasilis Borbokis and Akis Zikos as assistants.

On 19 April 2013, a Super League disciplinary committee voted to remove 3 points from AEK and award Panthrakikos a 3–0 win, after fans stormed the pitch and chased players from the field during the AEK–Panthrakikos match on 14 April 2013. As a result, AEK were relegated from the Super League to the second-tier Football League for the first time in their history. In addition, AEK were to start their Football League campaign with minus 2 points.

===2013–2024: Melissanidis return to ownership===
On 7 June 2013, during an AEK council, it was decided that AEK FC would become an amateur football club and would not participate in the Football League division for the 2013–14 season, preferring instead, to self-relegate and participate in the Football League 2 division and start from scratch. On the same day Dimitris Melissanidis, the former president of the club, became administrative leader of the club, under the supervision of Amateur AEK, with the aim of saving the club. Along with other notable AEK fans and old players, they went on to create the non-profit association Independent Union of Friends of AEK (; &quot;Anexártiti Énosi Fίlon AEK&quot;) which took the majority stake of the football club.

AEK began its revival by signing Traianos Dellas as their new head coach. Dellas led AEK to first place in the third national division with a record of 23 wins, 3 draws, and only one defeat. The following year AEK participated in the 2014–15 Football League, finishing first and undefeated in the regular season standings. AEK successfully finished first in the playoffs and gained promotion back to the top tier, the Greek Super League. The club&#x27;s biggest signing after returning to the Greek Super League was that of Argentinian star Diego Buonanotte, who only stayed at the club for a year.

On 20 October 2015, Traianos Dellas was forced to resign as a result of a dispute with the board, and a heavy 4–0 away loss to Olympiacos. Stelios Manolas was named interim coach and later Gus Poyet was appointed as new head coach. On 19 April, Poyet was fired by AEK Athens after being accused by the board of revealing private club conversations. Stelios Manolas took charge as interim coach once again. Manolas managed to guide AEK to a 3rd-place finish in the league qualifying for the playoff round and also to their first piece of silverware since the 2010–11 season by lifting the Greek Cup, defeating Olympiacos in the final 2–1. With the postponement of the final on two separate occasions and the congested fixture list of the playoff round, AEK had to play a fixture every three days, which evidently took its toll on the players, but they finished third in the playoffs and qualified for the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League Third Qualifying Round. The first season back in the top flight was considered a success with a trophy and qualification for European football the following season, a return after a five-year hiatus.


The new season started with high expectations by AEK Athens fans as the club signed Dmytro Chyhrynskyi, Hugo Almeida and Joleon Lescott, announcing three of the biggest transfers in their history. Unfortunately, the 34-year-old English defender suffered a knee detached cartilage while cycling in his apartment. The injury ruled Lescott out for the remainder of the season. The player refused to get help from the team&#x27;s doctors and insisted on completing his rehabilitation in the United Kingdom. The board did not agree to the player&#x27;s wishes and additional demands, which resulted in his contract being terminated. This outcome led what it until then seemed to be a powerful defending duo to a midsummer night&#x27;s nightmare. In addition, a 0–1 aggregate loss to AS Saint-Étienne in the Europa League qualifiers brought disappointment to fans&#x27; dreams of European participation. Nevertheless, AEK defeated Xanthi 4–1 in the first match of the season, raising hopes for domestic success. However, the decision was made to replace Temur Ketsbaia with José Morais; the decision was based on the team&#x27;s stuttering start to the season, 3 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, and poor displays. José&#x27;s arrival, however, did not improve the team&#x27;s results or performances, winning only three of his fourteen matches as manager. On 19 January 2017, former manager Manolo Jiménez was appointed as manager for the second time following José&#x27;s resignation. Upon his appointment he got the team from 7th place up to a 4th-place finish, and first place in the European Playoffs, claiming second place in the league overall and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League Third qualifying round. Jiménez also guided the team to a second consecutive Greek Cup final where they faced PAOK in a controversial game marred by pre-match violence between the two sets of fans and a winning goal from an offside position.

====UEFA Europa League unbeaten run and Greek champions====
The third season back in the top flight began with a tough draw in the Champions League Third qualifying round versus CSKA Moscow, ending in a 3–0 aggregate loss. The defeat meant AEK were demoted to the Europa League play-off round where they were pitted against Belgians Club Brugge. A 0–0 draw in Brugge in the first leg and a 3–0 win in the return in Athens meant that AEK qualified for the group stages of a major European competition for the first time in 6 years. They were seeded in pot 4 and drawn along with AC Milan, HNK Rijeka and Austria Wien. AEK would go on to qualify for the round of 32 undefeated, a statement that solidified their return as one of Europe&#x27;s elite teams, with a record of 1 win and 5 draws, the most notable being the two back-to-back 0–0 draws versus AC Milan. In the Round of 32 AEK were drawn against Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kyiv. AEK were better than their opponents, but also were unlucky and lost after two draws and on away goal rule. The first match took place in Athens, with a 1–1 draw and the second game in Kyiv, finished 0–0. In April, AEK won their 12th Greek championship, by recording a 2–0 home win against Levadiakos in front of 60,000 fans. This was their first championship after 24 years. AEK were crowned champions in front of 14,500 of their fans in the last matchday against Apollon Smyrnis at Georgios Kamaras Stadium.

====UEFA Champions League return and consecutive Greek Cup finals====

The 2018–19 season was the season that AEK returned to the groups of the UEFA Champions League, for the 5th time in the club&#x27;s history after eliminating Celtic (3–2 on aggregate) and MOL Vidi (3–2 on aggregate) in the qualifying stages.

Led by former Panathinaikos&#x27; manager, Marinos Ouzounidis, AEK were drawn in Group E against Bayern Munich, Benfica and Ajax but failed to make an impact after losing all six matches.

Key players Jakob Johansson, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos, Sergio Araujo and Ognjen Vranješ, as well as manager Manolo Jiménez, who were essential to the triumphant 2017–18 season, left the club, and most transfers failed to improve the team. Greek international Marios Oikonomou and Argentine striker Ezequiel Ponce were the only newcomers who managed to make an impact on an overall disappointing season (3rd place, 23 points behind 1st PAOK and 18 points behind 2nd Olympiacos – third consecutive cup final loss from PAOK, 1–0).

2017–18 champions, Ognjen Vranješ and Sergio Araujo returned to Athens, and some other notable additions included Portuguese international Nélson Oliveira and Serbian midfielder Nenad Krstičić. The 2019–20 season started catastrophically, with an early Europa League elimination by the Turkish side Trabzonspor (1–3 in Athens, 0–2 in Trabzon, 3–3 on aggregate) and disappointing domestic results. New manager Miguel Cardoso was sacked quickly and replaced with the club&#x27;s veteran player and manager, Nikos Kostenoglou who was also later replaced by Italian manager Massimo Carrera.

Under Carrera, AEK regained the confidence lost from the previous season and a half of bad results. Before the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, AEK was 3rd in the regular season and in the semi-finals of the Greek Cup (2–1 home victory against Aris in the first leg). Later they would reach the final for the fifth time in a row. However, they lost 1–0 to Olympiacos.

After the draw for the Europa League third qualifying round, AEK Athens got VfL Wolfsburg at the Play-off round and won 2–1 at the Athens Olympic Stadium, securing qualification to the Group stage.
However, AEK&#x27;s campaign results in the Europa League as well as the first half of the domestic Superleague were lackluster, the European campaign being one of their worst ever, only recording 1 win in the group stages. In December, Massimo Carrera was relieved of his duties and replaced by Manolo Jiménez, previous Super League and Greek Cup winner with AEK – his fourth term at the club.

====Major signings, new stadium and another double====

Hoping to rebuild, AEK acquired the services of Vladan Milojević. However, his tenure ended early, with AEK Athens being disqualified on penalties by Bosnia and Herzegovina club, Velež Mostar in 2021–22 Europa Conference League second qualifying round. Barely making it to Christmas, Milojevic&#x27;s head was turned by an offer from the Middle East, and AEK sacked him. They hired the Greek coach Argiris Giannikis, who managed PAS Giannina successfully prior to his appointment. However, his time at AEK was short and once again, he was sacked, with AEK B coach Sokratis Ofrydopoulos managing AEK through the turbulent play-off period and an exclusion from Europe. It was at this time that AEK searched for a new coach, and found one in the form of Matías Almeyda.

Ahead of the 2022–23 season and AEK&#x27;s entry into Agia Sophia Stadium, AEK underwent another rebuild under the leadership of Matias Almeyda. Signed as coach towards the end of the 2021–22 season but only taking over in the 2022–23 pre-season, Almeyda played a huge part in AEK&#x27;s 2022–23 success. Instilling a high-pressing, tireless, and attractive style of attacking football, he established AEK quickly as the best team in Greece along with Panathinaikos, themselves under the leadership of Ivan Jovanovic. Despite initial losses, Almeyda gave AEK great derby victories and team cohesion. Overcoming Panathinaikos&#x27; fantastic early-season unbeaten run, being 8 points behind the league leaders, AEK were level on points with Panathinaikos in the playoff round. Notably, AEK defeated PAOK 2–0 at home, 1–0 away, Panathinaikos 1–0, Olympiacos 3–0 in the Greek Cup (reaching the final with PAOK), and 3–1 away. They also underwent a 14-game win-streak at their new stadium, the Agia Sofia or OPAP Arena stadium.

The newly built stadium is located in the place where the old Nikos Goumas Stadium was situated, at Nea Filadelfeia. The Agia Sophia Stadium, also known as OPAP Arena for sponsoring reasons, is a category 4 UEFA stadium and can host 32,500 spectators. The net construction cost is estimated around € 81,700,000. The administrative region of Attica funded the stadium with the amount of € 20,000,000. The stadium&#x27;s opening ceremony took place on 30 September 2022. AEK Athens beat Ionikos 4–1 in the inaugural match on 3 October 2022, which was the sixth fixture of the 2022–23 Greek Super League.

In the summer transfer window of the 2022–23 season, AEK Athens announced the signing of two famous football players who played as opponents in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final in Russia. The first player was the Croatian center-back Domagoj Vida who previously played for Süper Lig side Beşiktaş, and the second player was the French right-back Djibril Sidibé, most recently of Ligue 1 club Monaco. The latter was the most valuable player to have ever arrived at the club with a market value of € 8,000,000, surpassing the previous record holder Juanfran by € 2,000,000. Sidibé is also the fifth World Cup winner to play in the Greek Super League, after Frenchman Christian Karembeu and Brazilian stars Rivaldo, Gilberto Silva and Denilson. 

AEK Athens were crowned champions on 14 May 2023, after beating Volos 4–0 to seal the title, 5 points ahead of second place Panathinaikos. AEK Athens thus won their 13th championship and the first in Nea Filadelfeia since 1994. On 25 May 2023, AEK Athens defeated PAOK 2–0 in the 2022–23 Greek Cup final to win the title and seal the double for the first time since 1978. The following season, AEK Athens went head-to-head throughout the whole season against PAOK, and ended up losing a potential second consecutive title, on the final game of the season, staying two points behind the first place. They lost in the Round of 16 of the Greek Cup against Aris on penalties, and got eliminated in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, in a group of death against AFC Ajax, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. and Olympique de Marseille.

=== 2024 to present: Marios Iliopoulos era ===
Following an ultimately disappointing season for AEK and a missed chance to win a second consecutive league title, major shareholder and owner Dimitris Melissanidis announced his departure from the club&#x27;s ownership on June 10th, 2024, selling his shares to Seajets owner, Marios Iliopoulos for a seeming €90 million. At his final interview, Melissanidis stated that he &quot;had completed his part and brought AEK back to the top, with a new stadium, a competitive team in Greek and European football, and zero debt&quot;.

At Iliopoulos presentation, AEK fans got a taste of what his vision was for the club, as he stated he wants a competitive team that will dominate Greek football and become a significant European power, while also focusing on the one thing AEK was lacking in, their academies. On a question regarding an increase on the transfer budget and a change on the current transfer policy, he urged AEK fans to &quot;put on their seatbelts slowly and enjoy it&quot;. Not long after, Iliopoulos backed his words up with actions, selling Ezequiel Ponce for a club record €9,000,000, while signing renowned players like Roberto Pereyra, Erik Lamela and Thomas Strakosha with club record contract fees.

The season, however, started with an early elimination of AEK from the Conference Cup by FC Noah.

On 19 September 2024, the club announced ex Manchester United player, Anthony Martial, on a three-year deal. This is the club&#x27;s highest valued player arrival, with an estimate of €10m. In October 2024 they announced the signing of Javier Ribalta as their new Executive Director.

==Crest==
In 1924, AEK adopted the image of a double-headed eagle (; Dikéfalos Aetós) as their emblem. Created by Greek refugees from Constantinople in the years following the Greco-Turkish War and subsequent population exchange, the emblem and colours (yellow and black) of AEK were chosen as a reminder of lost homelands; they represent the club&#x27;s historical ties to Constantinople. The double-headed eagle is featured in the flag of the various entities of the Greek Orthodox Church, whose headquarters are in Constantinople, and served as Imperial emblem under the Palaiologos dynasty, which was the last one to rule the Byzantine Empire.

AEK&#x27;s main emblem underwent numerous minor changes between 1924 and 1982. The design of the eagle on the shirt badge was often not identical to the design of the eagle depicted on official club correspondence, merchandise, and promotional material. All designs were considered &quot;official&quot; (in the broadest sense of the word), however, it was not until 1982 that an identifiable, copyrighted design was established as the club&#x27;s official, and shirt badge. The emblem design was changed in 1989, again in 1993, and again in 2013 to the current design.

==Anthem of AEK==
AEK&#x27;s club anthem, Embrós tis AEK Palikária (Advance AEK&#x27;s Lads), was composed by Stelios Kazantzidis. The lyrics were written by Christos Kolokotronis. The most popular version of the anthem is sung by ex-football player Mimis Papaioannou.
==Kit and colours==
The colours of yellow/gold and black were adopted due to AEK&#x27;s connections with Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.

AEK have almost always worn predominantly gold or yellow shirts and black shorts. An exception was the unusual but popular Kappa kits of the 1990s, which featured a large two-headed eagle motif across the kit.

AEK&#x27;s traditional away colours are all-black or all-white; on a few occasions, the club has worn a third kit of light blue, silver, dark red, or Tyrian purple (&quot;porphyra&quot;, a type of reddish purple), inspired by the use of the colour on the Byzantine war flag and by Byzantine imperial dynasties.

==Shirt sponsors and manufacturers==
Since 1 June 2021, AEK&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Nike. Previous manufacturers have been Adidas (1974–75, 1977–83 and 2005–07), Zita Hellas (1983–89), Diadora (1989–93), Basic (1993–95), Kappa (1995–2000), Puma (1975–77 and 2007–15) and Capelli (2018–21).

Starting in 2015, the club&#x27;s main shirt sponsors are OPAP, which also sponsored them in 2010–14. Previous shirt sponsors have been Citizen (1982–83), Nissan (1983–85), Ethniki Asfalistiki (1985–93 and 1995–96), Phoenix Asfaleies (1993–95), Geniki Bank (1996–98), Firestone (1999), Marfin Investment Group (1999–2001), Alpha Digital (2001–02), Piraeus Bank (2002–04), TIM (2004–06), LG (2006–08), Diners Club (2009–10), and Jeep (2014–15).

==Financial information==
Loukas Barlos, a successful bauxite Mine Owner, was also owner and president since 1974, and was in charge when Greek football turned professional in 1979. In 1981, due to health problems, he passed his shares to Andreas Zafiropoulos. In 1982 the business shipping magnate Michalis Arkadis became president, aiming to reinforce financial support, with Zafiropoulos holding the majority stake. In 1988, Zafiropoulos placed Efstratios Gidopoulos in the presidency, and AEK managed to win their first championship in ten years.

On 17 June 1992, the club passed to new owners. The business shipping magnate and oil tycoon Dimitris Melissanidis, together with Giannis Karras, took the majority stake and continued the successful and champion seasons.

After an unsuccessful season, in 1995, they passed their shares to Michalis Trochanas, and with his turn a percentage to ENIC Group investment company. In 1999, NETMED, a Dutch media company, took over the management of the club. A crisis period followed with mismanagement and many changes in the presidency. In 2004, ex-AEK player Demis Nikolaidis made a plan to progress with the reorganization and financial consolidation, and together with other investors (such as Nicholas X. Notias, Gikas Goumas, Takis Kanellopoulos, a shareholder of Titan Cement, and others) took the majority stake.

The plan initially seemed to work, but the downfall continued. The team was relegated after the 2012–13 season for the first time in its history. In an effort to discharge the immense debt created by years of mismanagement, its directors chose for the team to compete in the third tier. On the same day Dimitris Melissanidis, the old president of the club, became the administrative leader of AEK, under the supervision of the amateur AEK Later, together with other notable AEK fans and old players, they created the non-profit association &quot;Union Friends of AEK&quot; (&quot;Enosi Filon AEK&quot;) which took the majority stake of the football club.

In March 2015, AEK FC became the first Greek company that is listed in the Elite programme of the London Stock Exchange, a pan-European programme for ambitious high-growth businesses that was launched in 2012 at Borsa Italiana and following its success was rolled out in the UK in 2014, and the first Greek football club quoted on a stock exchange. Raffaele Jerusalmi, executive director of the board of directors of LSEG, stated: &quot;We are delighted to welcome AEK to the Elite programme&quot;. On 27 April 2015, AEK FC was selected for the honor of opening a session of the London Stock Exchange.

==Stadium==
Nikos Goumas Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Nea Filadelfeia (&quot;New Philadelphia&quot;), a northwestern suburb of Athens, Greece. It was used mostly for football matches and was the home stadium of AEK FC. It was named after one-time club president, Nicholas Goumas, who contributed to its building and later upgrading. It served as AEK&#x27;s home ground since 1930. The Nikos Goumas Stadium had severe damages from 1999&#x27;s earthquake and in 2003 was demolished with the prospect to build a new stadium for AEK FC. Unfortunately, prolonged obstruction, legal issues, and tight deadlines caused multiple delays to the project. 

In 2004 the club moved to the 70,000-capacity &quot;Spyros Louis&quot; (Athens Olympic Stadium) in Athens. The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens, also known as OAKA, is one of the most complete European athletic complexes.
It has hosted the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the 1997 World Championships in Athletics, the 1994 and 2007 UEFA Champions League Finals, as well as other important athletic and cultural events, the most significant of which remains the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Construction of an all-new purpose-built stadium initially began on 28 July 2017 in the site of the old Nikos Goumas stadium. It suffered from major delays due to the local authorities taking too long on confirming certain proposals concerning the stadium&#x27;s road system. Construction was completed in 2022. The stadium has capacity of approximately 32,500 fans and features a unique underground road system that the teams use to enter the stadium.

Agia Sophia Stadium features The Museum of Refugee Hellenism of AEK Athens. It is open daily from Tuesday to Sunday (10:00-18.00). 
The stadium&#x27;s opening ceremony took place on 30 September 2022. AEK Athens won Ionikos 4–1 in their new stadium opening game on 3 October 2022, a game conducted for the sixth fixture of the 2022–23 Greek Super League. 

===Training facility===

Since December 2010, AEK has been using state-of-the-art facilities in an area of 144 acres in the Mazareko area in Spata. Previously owned by Nicholas X. Notias, it is the most expensive (with a total cost around €25m) and one of the biggest training centers in Greece. These facilities include two lawns with natural turf and one with plastic for the needs of the Academies (which was created in 2013 with a viewing platform for spectators) and all the necessary and well-equipped areas for the preparation of a team with modern instruments. A standard football studio, one of the most complete in Greece. The main building of the centre hosts the offices of the club, a press room, and the players&#x27; rooms. The training ground is used by the first team and youth teams. The Spata Training Centre includes state-of-the-art facilities, a fitness and health centre with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy centre, and more. There are also plans for an AEK Museum, hotel, aquatic centre, and two more soccer fields. From 2013 on, AEK training centre services have been upgraded dramatically. The players of the teamwork daily in an environment with all the necessary infrastructure, while in the last few months, they have at their disposal in the basement of the building a treatment centre with the most modern means. Even the young athletes of the Academies work in facilities that very few Academies have in Greece. But the outlook is even more impressive. Since 2014, the official name of the ground is &quot;OPAP Sports Centre&quot;. On 4 July 2018, the Sports Centre came to auction which was bought by Dimitrios Melissanidis for a price of €3.5m and then donated it to AEK. Alongside the Sports Centre, Melissanidis also bought 70 hectares for an extra €5.5m which were added to the wider area of the existing training center and there will be additional stadiums along with the necessary additional facilities for the preparation of the team and for the hospitality of the players.

==Supporters, rivalries, and affiliations==

===Support===

AEK Athens has a large fan base across all of Greece and is the third most popular Greek football team in relation to their fan base. According to Sky Sports, AEK have around 20% of all Greek football fans. AEK&#x27;s fan base in Greece is believed to be over 1 million with various types of research suggesting AEK have an estimated fan base between 1.3 – 1.5 million fans in Greece. AEK Athens traditional fanbase comes from the area of Nea Filadelfeia, where the club is based, as well as a good part of the rest of the Athens area.

AEK has a strong following in the Greek diaspora especially in Cyprus where the club has a large following with a recent fan poll from Kerkida.net having AEK as the second most popular Greek-supported team in Cyprus behind Panathinaikos (34%) but ahead of Olympiacos (23%) with AEK having 27% of Cypriot football fans supporting the club. One of the main reasons AEK&#x27;s popularity in Cyprus is large making them ahead of Olympiacos the most popular Greek team in Greece is due to the fact AEK are a refugee club which many Greek Cypriots are after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and due to this many Greek Cypriots can relate to the similar history of AEKs being a refugee club. AEK have also a strong following in Australia, the US, the UK, Germany, and France.
The most hardcore supporters of AEK are Original 21, which is the largest group fan organisation of the club and is known for its loyal and passionate support.

===Supporters friendships===
A so-called &quot;triangle of brotherhood&quot; has developed between the largest left-wing fan clubs of AEK, Marseille and Livorno. The connection is mostly an ideological one.
Also, AEK&#x27;s and St. Pauli&#x27;s left-wing fans, have a strong friendship and their connection is mostly for ideological reasons.

There is an informal friendship and fraternization between the fans of AEK and Fenerbahçe. In the 2017 Euroleague final, Fenerbahçe S.K. supporters displayed a banner that read &quot;Same City&#x27;s Sons&quot;

===Rivalries===
AEK FC&#x27;s biggest rivalries are with Panathinaikos and Olympiacos.
Against their city neighbours Panathinaikos, they contest the Athens local football derby. The rivalry started not only because of both competing for the major titles, but also because of the refugee ancestry of a big part of AEK fans and, by contrast, that Panathinaikos was considered in general the representative of the Athenian high-class society.
The rivalry with Piraeus based club Olympiacos stems from the rivalry between two of the most successful Greek football clubs. The rivalry was particularly inflamed after 1996, when AEK&#x27;s former star player and then-manager Dušan Bajević moved to Olympiacos, and most recently after the controversial 2007–08 Super League which was awarded to Olympiacos.

<doc id="990657" wikidata="Q1758093" url="?curid=990657" title="Service data unit">
<text>In Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) terminology, a service data unit (SDU) is a unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer or sublayer to a lower layer. This unit of data (SDU) has not yet been encapsulated into a protocol data unit (PDU) by the lower layer. That SDU is then encapsulated into the lower layer&#x27;s PDU and the process continues until reaching the PHY, physical, or lowest layer of the OSI &quot;stack&quot;.

The SDU can also be thought of as a set of data that is sent by a user of the services of a given layer, and is transmitted semantically unchanged to a peer service user.

== SDU and PDU ==
It differs from a PDU in that the PDU specifies the data that will be sent to the peer protocol layer at the receiving end, as opposed to being sent to a lower layer.

The SDU accepted by any given layer (n) from layer (n+1) above, is a PDU of the layer (n+1) above. In effect the SDU is the &#x27;payload&#x27; of a given PDU. The layer (n) may add headers or trailers, or both, to the SDU and may do other kinds of reformatting, recoding, splitting or transformations on the data, forming one or more layer (n) PDUs. The added headers or trailers and other possible changes are part of the process that makes it possible to get data from a source to a destination. Layer (n) may also generate additional layer (n) PDUSs. Each unit of data that layer (n) gives to layer (n-1) below is in turn handed down as a layer (n-1) SDU.

When the PDU of layer (n+1), plus any metadata layer (n) would add; would exceed the maximum size a layer-n PDU can be (called layer (n)&#x27;s maximum transmission unit); the SDU must be split into multiple payloads for layer (n); a process known as fragmentation.

=== MAC SDU ===
MAC SDUS or MSDUS are data units transmitted between other Media access controllers on a lower OSI Layer. The PDU counterpart MAC PDU that does the same thing but on the same OSI Layer. When there are larger MAC PDU&#x27;s as MAC SDU&#x27;s in the system, the MAC PDU includes more MAC SDU&#x27;s, because of packet aggregation. If the MAC PDU&#x27;s are smaller then the MAC SDU&#x27;s includes more MAC PDU&#x27;s, because of packet segmentation.

<text>Death of a Gunfighter is a 1969 American Western film directed by Robert Totten and Don Siegel. It stars Richard Widmark and Lena Horne and features an original score by Oliver Nelson. The theme of the film is the &quot;passing&quot; of the West, the clash between a traditional character and the politics and demands of modern society. The film direction is credited to Allen Smithee, a pseudonym that has subsequently been used by directors who do not wish to be credited for their film.

==Plot==
In the town of Cottonwood Springs, Texas at the turn of the century, Marshal Frank Patch is an Old West style lawman in a community determined to move beyond its rough past into the 20th century. When Patch kills drunken Luke Mills in self-defense, the town council decides it is time for the marshal to retire so that a modern police force can be established in the town. Patch refuses, reminding the citizens that when he took the job, the agreement was he could have it as long as he wanted- and he still wanted the job. Afraid of Patch because of his violent nature and his knowledge of their misdeeds in the town&#x27;s wilder days, the city fathers then enlist the aid of the county sheriff (a Patch protege and friend) to oust him. Patch rebuffs this attempt and the sheriff backs off, bowing out of the dispute. This leads some of the more outspoken councilmen to consider having Patch murdered.

Patch had humiliated one of the town&#x27;s councilmen, Andrew Oxley, (a cowardly lawyer) at the ad hoc &quot;firing-notice meeting&quot; by slapping him in disgust. Knowing that the incident had deeply embarrassed his grown son, the man resolved to ambush and kill Patch, but when Patch trapped him in a room, he turned the gun on himself rather than face the marshal. The man&#x27;s son vowed revenge, egged on by some of the councilmen, who saw this as a convenient way of ridding themselves of the problematic town marshal. They plot to ambush Patch. Aware that he will probably be killed, Patch marries his long-time girlfriend Claire, the local brothel madame. The marriage is on the same day as Luke Mill&#x27;s funeral, after which Patch&#x27;s murder is planned by the councilmen. The dead man&#x27;s son Will breaks with the plan and attempts to kill Patch on his own, but is mortally wounded by Patch. Patch explains to the dying youth that his late &quot;father&quot; had shot a man in the back many years ago, killing him. Patch covered it up because the murderer agreed to raise the dead man&#x27;s young son as his own. Patch then pursued one of the instigators of the plot to kill him, a cynical saloon owner named Locke. He wounds, captures, and jails Locke, but then insists on going back out after the councilmen, probably aware that he may be gunned down. After stopping by the church, he is shot down on the town&#x27;s main street by several riflemen on the rooftops. Claire is seen leaving town that night on a train.

==Alan Smithee credit==
The film began under the direction of Robert Totten, an experienced television director (&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;). After clashes with star Widmark, and almost a year of work, he was dropped and replaced by Don Siegel, who&#x27;d recently directed Widmark in &quot;Madigan&quot;. When the film was finished Siegel did not want his name to replace Totten&#x27;s. Widmark protested and an agreement was made with the Directors Guild of America for the pseudonym Alan Smithee to be used.

Despite the dispute, critics praised the film and its &quot;new&quot; director. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the film was &quot;sharply directed by Allen Smithee who has an adroit facility for scanning faces and extracting sharp background detail,&quot; Roger Ebert called the film &quot;an extraordinary western ... director Allen Smithee, a name I&#x27;m not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally.&quot;

<doc id="990666" wikidata="Q4677324" url="?curid=990666" title="Action of 26 May 1646">
<text>This battle took place on 26 May 1646 at the mouth of the Dardanelles Strait, during the Cretan War. The Ottoman fleet under the Kapudan Pasha, Kara Musa Pasha, tried to defeat the Venetian fleet, under Tommaso Morosini. The Venetians were blockading the Dardanelles, trying thus to prevent reinforcements and supplies to be brought to Crete, a Venetian possessions which the Ottomans had invaded the previous year, and to disrupt the flow of supplies to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople.

The Ottoman fleet numbered 75 galleys and 5 galleasses, while the Venetian fleet was dispersed due to taking on water at Imbros; of the 28 sailing ships in Morosini&#x27;s fleet, only seven took part in the action. After seven hours of battle, the Ottoman fleet withdrew back into the Strait, except for a few galleys that managed to slip through and reach Chios. Several Turkish ships were damaged, but none lost, although some accounts suggest that the ships that made it to Chios had to be abandoned due to their extensive damage.

Despite this success, the Ottoman fleet managed to break out of the Dardanelles shortly after. On 4 June, taking advantage of the becalmed sea and lack of wind, which immobilized the Venetian sailing ships, sixty Ottoman galleys dashed out of the Strait, and even towed four galleasses behind them. Morosini had previously asked Venice for galleys for this reason, but had received none. The Ottoman fleet went to Chios, where it was joined by ships from the Barbary states, and boarded 20,000 troops bound for Crete. Disagreements among the Venetian and allied commanders meant that the Christian fleet was unable to stop them from ferrying these men to Crete.

<doc id="990668" wikidata="Q2026008" url="?curid=990668" title="Works inspired by Tolkien">
<text>The works of J. R. R. Tolkien have served as the inspiration to painters, musicians, film-makers and writers, to such an extent that he is sometimes seen as the &quot;father&quot; of the entire genre of high fantasy.

== Art and illustration ==

The earliest illustrations of Tolkien&#x27;s works were drawn by the author himself. The 1937 American edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was illustrated by professional draughtsmen. Tolkien was very critical of this work, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of the &quot;Hobbit&quot; as &quot;too &#x27;Disnified&#x27; for my taste: Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of&quot;.

In 1948, Milein Cosman was invited by Tolkien&#x27;s publishers to submit illustrations for &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;. Tolkien felt her impressionistic style did not suit the story, and she was replaced by Pauline Baynes, who later also supplied the illustrations for &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; (1962) and &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; (1967). In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, mostly in coloured ink, by the English artist Mary Fairburn; Tolkien said of her pictures: &quot;They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.&quot; For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn&#x27;s illustrations were unknown until 2012. Princess Margrethe (now Queen Margrethe II) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to create illustrations to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the early 1970s. In 1977, Queen Margrethe&#x27;s drawings were published in the Danish translation of the book, redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser.

Tim and Greg Hildebrandt, usually called the Brothers Hildebrandt, were Tolkien illustrators in the 1970s, known especially for their Middle-earth calendars. 
The British artist Jimmy Cauty created a best-selling poster of The Lord of the Rings (1976) and The Hobbit (1980) for the retailer Athena.

Well-known Tolkien illustrators of the 1990s and 2000s are John Howe, Alan Lee, and Ted Nasmith — Lee for illustrated editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Nasmith for illustrated editions of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and Howe for the cover artwork to several Tolkien publications. Howe and Lee worked as concept artists in the creation of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy. In 2004, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction on the film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.
Other artists who have found inspiration in Tolkien&#x27;s works include Inger Edelfeldt who illustrated the covers of Swedish translations of several of his books, Anke Eißmann, Michael Hague, Tove Jansson (of Moomin fame, illustrator of Swedish and Finnish translations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;), Paul Raymond Gregory, Tim Kirk, Angus McBride who illustrated Iron Crown&#x27;s Tolkien-based role-playing games, Jef Murray, Colleen Doran, Jenny Dolfen who has made watercolour paintings of scenes from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Alexander Korotich, who made a series of scraperboard engravings of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and Peter Xavier Price. Works of several of these artists were exhibited in an &quot;Images of Middle-earth&quot; exhibition of some 170 artworks organised by Davide Martini of the Greisinger Museum of Switzerland; it toured Italy between 2003 and 2005.
==Film==

The 2005–2010 &quot;Narnia&quot; film trilogy adapted from the novel series by Tolkien&#x27;s friend C. S. Lewis were produced due to the popularity of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. George R. R. Martin acknowledged that Tolkien influenced his 2011–2019 &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; TV series and novels about medieval fantasy, while speaking about a movie about Tolkien&#x27;s life.

An early draft for George Lucas&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film is said to have included an exchange of dialogue between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker taken directly from the conversation between Gandalf and Bilbo in Chapter 1 of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, where Gandalf/Kenobi says &quot;Good morning!&quot; and Bilbo/Luke replies asking whether he means he&#x27;s having a good morning, or is wishing him one, or that all mornings are good. Gandalf/Kenobi answers &quot;All of them at once&quot;. The plagiarised dialogue was dropped, but Lucas modelled the monk-like Kenobi on Gandalf; the film author Chris Taylor identifies several further elements of &quot;Star Wars&quot; that in his view could have been modelled on Middle-earth.

While working on a &quot;Star Wars&quot; animated series, Dave Filoni noted that Peter Jackson visited him and his mentor George Lucas to discuss Tolkien&#x27;s works and to ask for advice. According to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; website, Darth Vader is compared by Filoni to the Balrog rather than Sauron, and the Prancing Pony bar may have inspired the Mos Eisley cantina, the introduction of Han Solo suggestively matching that of Strider (Aragorn). As for the prequel trilogy, it notes that Saruman influenced Count Dooku, and volcanic Mordor, whether Tolkien&#x27;s or Jackson&#x27;s, influenced the volcanic planet Mustafar.

==Literature==

=== Fantasy ===

As early as 1984, Diana Paxson argued in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that Tolkien had founded a new literary tradition. Since then, many authors have found inspiration in Tolkien&#x27;s work. Following the success of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the 1960s, publishers were quick to try to meet a new demand for literate fantasy in the American marketplace.

Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot; series, beginning with &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; in 1968, was one of the first fantasy series influenced by Tolkien. Among the Tolkienian archetypes in the Earthsea books are wizards (including the protagonist, Ged), a disinherited prince (Arren in &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;), a magical ring (the ring of Erreth-Akbe in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;), a Middle-earth style quest (in &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;), and powerful dragons (like the dragon of Pendor, in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;).

Patricia A. McKillip&#x27;s &quot;The Forgotten Beasts of Eld&quot; and Jane Yolen&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Three of Solatia&quot; were Tolkien-inspired fantasies for young adults written in the mid-1970s. Ballantine, under the direction of editor Lin Carter, published public domain and relatively obscure works under the banner of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, aimed at adult readers who enjoyed Tolkien&#x27;s works. Lester del Rey, however, sought for new books that would mirror Tolkien&#x27;s work, and published Terry Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, David Eddings&#x27;s &quot;Belgariad&quot;, and Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot;. Guy Gavriel Kay, who had assisted Christopher Tolkien with the editing of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, later wrote his own Tolkien-influenced fantasy trilogy, &quot;The Fionavar Tapestry&quot;, complete with dwarfs and mages. Dennis L. McKiernan&#x27;s Silver Call duology was intended to be a direct sequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; but had to be altered. The &quot;Iron Tower&quot; trilogy, highly influenced by Tolkien&#x27;s books, was then written as backstory. Fantasy series such as Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; and Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; were &quot;undoubtedly&quot; influenced by Tolkien.

Due to a loophole in Russian copyright law, Russian writers were able to publish fantasy novels set in Tolkien&#x27;s Arda. Nick Perumov&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of Darkness&quot; (Russian &quot;Кольцо Тьмы&quot;) takes place after the events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

From 1980, the term &quot;fantasy&quot; became synonymous with the general aspects of Tolkien&#x27;s work: multiple races including dwarves and elves, a quest to destroy a magical artifact, and an evil that seeks to control the world. The plot of Pat Murphy&#x27;s 1999 &quot;There and Back Again&quot; intentionally mirrors that of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, but is transposed into a science-fiction setting involving space travel. J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been seen as having been influenced by Tolkien&#x27;s work; in particular, the wizard Dumbledore has been described as partially inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s Gandalf. S.M. Stirling&#x27;s &quot;Emberverse&quot; series, published starting in 2004, includes a character obsessed with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and Dúnedain of Middle-earth. The same plot point was used by the Russian writer Vladimir Berezin in his novel &quot;Road Signs&quot; (from the Universe of Metro 2033). Stephen King, best known as a horror writer, has acknowledged Tolkien&#x27;s influence on his novel &quot;The Stand&quot; as well as his fantasy series &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. Other prominent fantasy writers including George R. R. Martin, Michael Swanwick, Raymond E. Feist, Poul Anderson, Karen Haber, Harry Turtledove, Charles De Lint, and Orson Scott Card have acknowledged Tolkien&#x27;s work as an inspiration.

===Graphic novels===

The cartoonist Jeff Smith was influenced by Tolkien, and the mythologies that inspired his works. He has characterized his epic 1,300-page graphic novel &quot;Bone&quot; as &quot;Bugs Bunny meets &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It&#x27;s a really long fairy tale with some fantasy elements but a lot of comedy.&quot;

===Parody===

The first commercially published parody of Tolkien&#x27;s work was the 1969 &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, by &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;. 
The BBC produced a parody radio serial, &quot;Hordes of the Things&quot;, in 1980.
&quot;The Last Ringbearer&quot; is a 1999 fantasy novel by the palaeontologist Kirill Eskov in the form of a parallel novel showing the war from the perspective of the people of Sauron&#x27;s land of Mordor, under the notion that the original is a &quot;history written by the victors&quot;.

==Radio plays==
Three radio plays based on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; have been made, broadcast in 1955–1956, 1979 and 1981 respectively. The first and last ones were produced by the BBC. Tolkien heavily criticised the 1955-56 production.

==Music==
Numerous songs and other musical works, in a wide range of idioms, have been inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s fiction.

===Hard rock and heavy metal ===

Jack Bruce wrote a song called &quot;To Isengard&quot; on his first solo album &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot; (1969).

Progressive rock acts which have composed songs based on Tolkien&#x27;s characters and stories include Rush (&quot;Rivendell&quot;), 
Camel (&quot;Nimrodel&quot;, &quot;The White Rider&quot;), 
Mostly Autumn (&quot;Music Inspired by The Lord of the Rings&quot; CD, 2001), 
Glass Hammer (&quot;The Middle-Earth Album&quot;, 2001), 
Bo Hansson (&quot;Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings&quot;, 1970),
and the indie rock band Gatsbys American Dream.
The hard rock and classic metal band Led Zeppelin wrote several songs inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s works including &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;Ramble On&quot;, and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (with debate about some parts of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;). Tom Rapp set most of The Verse of the One Ring (&quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...&quot;) to music as &quot;Ring Thing&quot; in Pearls Before Swine&#x27;s second album, &quot;Balaklava&quot; (1968). Bob Catley, lead singer of the British prog rock band Magnum, released a solo album titled &quot;Middle Earth&quot;. Punk quartet Thrice released a song called &quot;The Long Defeat&quot; about Tolkien&#x27;s philosophies. The East Texas-based rock band Hobbit has produced multiple albums inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s work. 

Among the heavy metal artists influenced by Tolkien are Blind Guardian, who composed numerous songs relating to Middle-earth, including the whole of the concept album &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot;, based on &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. The album was &quot;adored&quot; by fans of Tolkien and metal, but despised as escapist by grunge fans.

Many black metal bands, at least 85 specifically, out of 151 &quot;metal bands&quot; in a 2015 search, have made use of Middle-earth themes in their lyrics, artwork, and band names. One such is Black Breath, named for the terror-inducing Black Breath of the Nazgûl.

The symphonic black metal band Summoning states that most of its songs are based on Middle-Earth, with focus on the orcs and dark forces.
Battlelore&#x27;s lyrics are about Middle-earth characters and events in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, as well as medieval literature and the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, as is their pseudo-medieval stage show, in which each member is dressed as &quot;ferocious warriors&quot;, &quot;dirty thieves&quot; or &quot;beautiful female elves&quot;.
The Italian group Ainur (named for Tolkien&#x27;s Ainur) released Middle-earth themed albums named &quot;Children of Hurin&quot; (2007) and &quot;Lay of Leithian&quot; (2009).

Bands and musicians who have used Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium for their stage names include the progressive rock band Marillion (from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;). Gorgoroth take their name from an area of Mordor, Burzum take their name from the Black Speech of Mordor, Cirith Ungol take their name from the pass on the western path of Mordor, the dwelling of the spider Shelob and Amon Amarth take their name after an alternative name for Mount Doom. Lead singer of Dimmu Borgir, Shagrath, takes his stage name from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, after an orc captain.
===Jazz===
Australian jazz musician and composer, John Sangster, made six albums of musical responses to Tolkien&#x27;s work. He recorded &quot;The Hobbit Suite&quot; (1973, Swaggie Records – S1340), and &quot;Double Vibe: Hobbit&quot; (1977); the first of these, with a selection from the second, was released on CD in 2002 (Swaggie CD 404). The later four double albums, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: A Musical Interpretation, v. 1, 2 and 3&quot; (1975–77), and &quot;Landscapes of Middle-earth&quot; (1978), have been re-released on CD, 2002-06: Move Records MD 3251, 3252, 3253, and 3254.

===Folk===
Sally Oldfield&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Water Bearer&quot; (1978) was inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;Songs of the Quendi&quot;, which quote from his poems.

The folk group The Hobbitons, part of the Dutch chapter of the Tolkien Society, released a CD in 1996 with 16 tracks of settings of Tolkien&#x27;s poems.

The Irish singer Enya contributed a song &quot;May it Be&quot; for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001) movie soundtrack. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. She released a song entitled &quot;Lothlórien&quot;, on her 1991 album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;.

In 2001, bluegrass and anti-folk artist Chris Thile released an instrumental album titled &quot;Not All Who Wander Are Lost&quot;, referencing Gandalf&#x27;s words to Bilbo and Bilbo&#x27;s poem about Aragorn. One of the songs on the album is &quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;, sharing the title of one of the chapters in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.
The Celtic foursome Broceliande&#x27;s album &quot;The Starlit Jewel&quot; sets to music selected songs by Tolkien.
Other folk rock and new age musicians inspired by Tolkien include Za Frûmi (singing in Orkish), Nickel Creek, David Arkenstone and Lyriel, among others. The Spanish Neoclassical Dark Wave band derived its name from Tolkien&#x27;s song &quot;Narsilion&quot; about the creation of the Sun and Moon.

=== Classical / film score ===

Donald Swann set music in the British art-song tradition to a collection of seven of Tolkien&#x27;s lyrics and poems, published as &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;. The work was approved by Tolkien himself, who collaborated on the published book, to which he provided notes and commentary. The songs were recorded by William Elvin (bass-baritone) with Swann on piano, and released in 1967 on an LP by Caedmon Records.

The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg has written three full-scale symphonic poems, Quendi (2008), Telperion et Laurelin (2014), and Fëanor (2017), inspired by passages from the Silmarillion. The works were premiered in Southern France. Romberg has also set Tolkien&#x27;s Elven language poems to music in his work &quot;Eldarinwë Liri&quot; for girls&#x27; choir. The work premiered in 2010 with the Norwegian Girls Choir and Trio Mediæval at the Vestfold International Festival.

Johan de Meij&#x27;s Symphony No. 1, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, for concert band, is in five movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the novel: Gandalf, Lothlorien, Gollum, Journey in the Dark (The Mines of Moria /The Bridge of Khazad-Dum), and Hobbits. The symphony was written between March 1984 and December 1987, and was premièred in Brussels on 15 March 1988. It has been recorded four times, including in an orchestral version, orchestrated by Henk de Vlieger. It won Sudler Composition Award in 1989.

Jacqueline Clarke&#x27;s setting &quot;Tinuviel&quot; (1983), for countertenor solo, SATB choir, and piano accompaniment has been published in score.

Leonard Rosenman composed music for the Ralph Bakshi animated movie, while Howard Shore composed the music of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series.

Paul Corfield Godfrey has written a large number of works based on Tolkien, the most significant of which is the four-evening cycle on &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; but also including three operas based on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: &quot;Tom Bombadil&quot; (one act), &quot;The Black Gate is closed&quot; (three acts) and &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;. as well as several sets of songs. His third symphony, &quot;Ainulindalë&quot;, is based on the opening chapter of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and there is a half-hour setting of &quot;The Lay of Eärendil&quot; based on Bilbo&#x27;s song at Rivendell.

The Tolkien Ensemble published four CDs from 1997 to 2005 with the aim to create &quot;the world&#x27;s first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;. The project was given approval by both the Tolkien Estate and HarperCollins Publishers. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave permission to use her illustrations in the CD layout.

Aulis Sallinen, one of the leading classical music composers of Finland, composed his Seventh Symphony named &quot;The Dreams of Gandalf&quot; in 1996, from music initially meant to accompany a ballet.

The Australian musician, Patrick Flegg, late husband of Tolkien illustrator Mary Fairburn, composed a piano suite, &quot;Anduin: The Mighty River&quot;, recorded by Wendy Rowlands (2001).

The Canadian composer Glenn Buhr has written a three-movement tone poem &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot; which he has recorded with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as part of his CD &quot;Winter Poems&quot;.

== Games ==

Many model-based games, trading card games, board games and video games are set in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; In a broader sense, many fantasy role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D)&quot; and &quot;DragonQuest&quot; feature Tolkienesque creatures and were influenced by Tolkien&#x27;s works. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books, as were other dungeon crawler and action-adventure games. The books themselves have been reproduced in video game form repeatedly, though without necessarily reflecting the power of Tolkien&#x27;s storytelling.

Early miniature wargames include &quot;The Ringbearer&quot; (1975). Games Workshop have made &quot;The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game&quot; (2001), which, while part of the film trilogy&#x27;s merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films.

Early board games included &quot;Battle of Five Armies&quot; (1975) and the series of &quot;Middle Earth Games&quot; from Simulations Publications, Inc. in 1977, containing the games &quot;War of the Ring&quot; (strategic, covering all three books), &quot;Gondor&quot; (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and &quot;Sauron&quot; (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age). More recent games include a game simply entitled &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (2000) and &quot;War of the Ring&quot; (2004, strategic, covering all three books).

Among role-playing and card games based on Middle-earth, Iron Crown Enterprises made &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; game (1982–1999) and &quot;Middle-earth Collectible Card Game&quot; (1995–1999). Decipher, Inc. created &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot; (2002), both based on the Jackson films. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game&quot; (2011) is made by Fantasy Flight Games under their &quot;Living Card Game&quot; line. &quot;Adventures in Middle-earth&quot; (2016) is a D&amp;D-compatible role-playing game released by Cubicle 7.

== Fan works ==

The first piece of Middle-earth fan fiction was published in 1959. 
Fanzines started to be produced soon after Tolkien fans formed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; on 4 September 1960 at the Pittsburgh Worldcon. That group&#x27;s magazine was &quot;I Palantir&quot;, edited by Ted Johnstone. Its British members had their own fanzine, &quot;Nazgul&#x27;s Bane&quot;. Ed Meskys published his science fiction fanzine &quot;Niekas&quot; from 1962, including at least one piece on Tolkien per issue. By 1964, there were dozens of Tolkien fanzines across the US, and several in England.
In 1969, Glen GoodKnight founded &quot;Mythlore&quot; as the fanzine of his Mythopoeic Society. Always serious, it transformed into a peer-reviewed journal in 1999. The Winter 1976 issue of &quot;Evermist&quot; was a special Tolkien edition, in a fanzine not otherwise dedicated to his work.

Broadening Internet access and a surge of interest driven by the Jackson films resulted in the production of a large amount of Tolkien fan fiction and Tolkien artwork in online communities, beginning in the early 2000s. Tolkien-inspired fan works include the fan films &quot;The Hunt for Gollum&quot; and &quot;Born of Hope&quot;, the novel &quot;The Last Ringbearer&quot;, and over 80,000 others listed in 2022. In 2004, sites for Tolkien-derived works were estimated to be 10% of all fan fiction websites, and, in 2019, Tolkien fan fiction was one of the most popular categories for works based on books on both Archive of Our Own and FanFiction.net.

The study of Middle-earth fan works has been largely neglected by Tolkien scholars and fan studies scholars alike. Many studies have been qualitative, focusing on a few selected fan works.

<text>Ultimate Fantastic Four is a superhero comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The series is a modernized re-imagining of Marvel&#x27;s long-running &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic book franchise as part of the Ultimate Marvel imprint. The Ultimate Fantastic Four team exists alongside other revamped Marvel characters in Ultimate Marvel titles including Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, and The Ultimates.

While the characters remain relatively faithful to their original Marvel Universe conception, they differ in a number of notable aspects. The origin story of the team is modified and modernized and the team is much younger, being in their late teens to early 20s. The series revolves around the adventures of teen genius: Reed Richards, his childhood friend: Ben Grimm, and siblings: Susan and Johnny Storm, who get engulfed in a malfunctioned teleporter experiment and begin to develop super-powers: Reed can stretch his body to impossible lengths, Susan can project force fields and turn invisible, Johnny develops pyrokinetic super-powers and Ben is transformed into a rocky-skinned figure with super-human strength and durability. The series takes place in contemporary New York City and was met with mostly favorable responses from readers and critics, with the fresh, unique and modernized re-imagining of the classic Fantastic Four mythos, the artwork and the writing runs of Millar, Bendis and Ellis, being points of praise, while criticism was aimed at the perceived decline in quality of the writing, as the series progressed.

The title was created by Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar and Adam Kubert. The series debuted in early 2004 and had a monthly publishing schedule. Issue #60, the last of the series, was written by Joe Pokaski and drawn by Tyler Kirkham and was followed by a series epilogue in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four: Requiem&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; was the fifth continuing series of the Ultimate Marvel series, after &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; and &quot;The Ultimates&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team-Up&quot;. The first writers assigned by project leader Bill Jemas were Mark Millar (&quot;The Ultimates&quot;, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;) and Brian Michael Bendis (&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;), who had both previously written comics in the Ultimate Marvel universe. Grant Morrison was involved in conceptualizing &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; and was at one point set to write the series. However, they departed from Marvel for an exclusivity contract with DC Comics before this could be finalized. Bryan Hitch designed the costumes for the characters, thus explaining their aesthetic resemblance to the costumes worn by the protagonists of &quot;The Ultimates&quot;.

In the &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four Vol. 1&quot; hardcover edition, Millar and Bendis write about the somewhat odd circumstances of their collaboration. Foremost, virtual communication was the only method available as Millar lives in Glasgow, Scotland, and Bendis in Portland, Oregon. Secondly, they both had considerably different writing styles, as Millar&#x27;s stories are typically fast-paced and widescreen, while Bendis&#x27; output is more dialogue-heavy and slow-paced and both writers feared it could wreck the project. It was agreed that Millar would write the plot and Bendis finalized the scripts based on his plots.

Millar completely rewrote the origin for the protagonists because he was not satisfied with the original 1961 story, in which the four team members steal a space craft to beat the Soviets to the moon. In their version, Millar and Bendis wrote a story in which Reed Richards is a child prodigy, protected by his burly friend Ben Grimm from bullies, who had invented a method of teleportation in his youth. He is discovered by government official Willie Lumpkin, and subsequently recruited into a think tank/school located in the upper floors of the Baxter building. There he meets Professor Storm, who leads the project, and his children, bioengineer Susan Storm and her younger brother Johnny. Reed also becomes the rival of Victor Van Damme, a fellow student. When Reed turns 21, he plans to teleport an apple into a parallel universe (the &quot;N-Zone&quot;), but Van Damme claims Reed&#x27;s calculations are wrong and changes the setup at the last minute. The five students are teleported through the N-Zone, and when they rematerialize, they return heavily mutated. After the Fantastic Four return to the Baxter building, they face their first opponent, Mole Man.

Although staying relatively true to the original stories, Millar&#x27;s storylines and writing deviated from the original source material in notable ways, almost bypassing the original works by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Most notable were changes to the characters&#x27; personality and backgrounds. The character of Reed Richards, in the mainstream Marvel Comics super-intelligent and a true leader, had his previous role split, with Professor Storm taking his leader traits, while the 21-year-old idealist Reed retains his super-intelligence. Reed no longer automatically assumes leadership of the team in demanding situations, a role more often filled by Sue Storm. She was little more than a damsel in distress in the early comics, but in this version, she is the most head-strong and assertive member of the team, and has a gift for biochemistry and bioengineering. Ben Grimm, no longer Reed&#x27;s college friend but his grade-school friend, is not as intelligent and has to have science explained to him, providing an opportunity for plot dumps.

In the end, both writers were satisfied with the results. Millar and Bendis stated that they had many more ideas, but massive scheduling problems forced them out. Instead, they persuaded Warren Ellis to continue the series. Ellis wrote the next arc, &quot;Doom&quot;, centering on Victor Van Damme. He made Van Damme a descendant of Dracula, a boy whose childhood ended when he was 10, formed by his severe, authoritarian father. Ellis also fleshed out the hard science fiction element behind the FF, namely writing that they gained their powers because the teleportation changed their &quot;phase space condition&quot; into something from an alternate universe; in laymen&#x27;s terms, there are multiple conceivable states of an object, a &#x27;phase space&#x27; of all the possible ways they could be. While in the N-Zone, each one of them mutated into another form that they could have been. It was also explained that Reed&#x27;s body functions because his cells were replaced with &quot;pliable bacterial stacks&quot;, single cells which duplicate most of the larger functions of the human body and does not rip or tear when he extends.

The next arc &quot;N-Zone&quot; has the four traveling on the spaceship &quot;Awesome&quot; (a name of Johnny&#x27;s choice) to the dimension where they got their powers. They encounter an alien named Nihil whose dimension has only a few hundred thousand years left before succumbing to an entropic heat death, and wishes to escape from his world to ours.

In &quot;Think Tank&quot; the team meet Rhona Burchill (a re-imagined Mad Thinker), who captures them and attempts to sell them to the highest bidder. In &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #1, they meet Crystal of the Inhumans, and as a result of trespassing on their home destroy it, forcing the Inhumans to move to a new one. &quot;Crossover&quot; has them encountering zombie infected versions of themselves and every other hero of that world. With the help of that world&#x27;s Magneto the Fantastic Four manage to escape with the few survivors. &quot;Tomb of Namor&quot; has the Four encountering Atlantian criminal Namor who only leaves when he gets a kiss from Susan Storm. In &quot;Super-Skrull&quot; Reed Richards goes back in time to the teleportation accident to ensure it does not go wrong. There is dispute amongst the team whether this is the right course of action. However, after a cruel prank played by Johnny Storm on Ben Grimm, the team realize just how depressed Ben is being trapped inside &#x27;The Thing&#x27;. Reed goes back and makes the experiment a success. This alters the time-line so that everyone on the planet except Ben has superpowers thanks to the Skrull pill given to them by the Skrulls and the leader Super-Skrull. The Skrulls however have tricked humanity and the still-human Ben Grimm is their last hope. In &quot;Frightful&quot;, Johnny is infected with an illness only Doctor Doom can cure; it also features the escape of the Frightful Four. In &quot;God War&quot;, alien terrorists attack Reed, who is looking for a seed while also facing a powerful enemy. The next arc &quot;Devils&quot; introduces Diablo who kidnaps those close to the four as bait; he intends to get immortality by using Reed&#x27;s sister as a power source.

&quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;, along with &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; was canceled after the events of the 2008 – 2009 &quot;Ultimatum&quot; miniseries.

The members of the team are the focus of &quot;Ultimate Comics: Doomsday&quot;.

===Ultimate FF===
A new volume dubbed &quot;Ultimate FF&quot; (with &quot;FF&quot; standing for &quot;Future Foundation&quot;, not &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;) was launched in April 2014, starring Invisible Woman, Iron Man, the Falcon, Machine Man, Phil Coulson, and Victor van Damme. The title was written by Joshua Hale Fialkov and Stuart Moore, with art by Mario Guevara, Tom Grummett and André Araújo. In August 2014 with the release of issue 6, &quot;Ultimate FF&quot; was officially cancelled.

==Team roster==
===Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic / Maker===

Reed is a child genius who displayed his curiosity from the day he was born. At the age of 11, following a demonstration of his research on the field of teleportation at a school science fair, Reed was recruited for a government program which sponsors young geniuses&#x27; research. He continued his research at the government research facility located in Manhattan&#x27;s Baxter Building. At the age of 21, his research was realized as he and several others attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate plane of existence called the N-Zone. The experiment went awry giving Reed and several others superpowers. His powers enable him to stretch his body parts to incredible lengths and endow him with enhanced durability.

Reed&#x27;s powers have been increased in comparison to that of his Earth-616 counterpart. He no longer needs to eat nor sleep, and has no internal organs or bones. He can stretch his eyes, specifically the lens so that he does not need his glasses or any other visual augmentation but can only sustain this for short periods. Sue&#x27;s mother revealed that she knows that Reed&#x27;s abilities allow him to stretch his brain in order to accommodate and solve almost any problem thus making him effectively a human computer. While Threshold calls him a &#x27;warrior without equal&#x27; in &quot;God War&quot; this almost certainly refers to his success in discovering a way to defeat an undefeatable foe (Ultimate Ronan) as opposed to actual battlefield prowess. Sue lauds his expertise in physics.

After Ultimatum, Reed left the Baxter Building and returned home much to the chagrin of his father. In &quot;Ultimate Enemy&quot; #1, the Richards&#x27; house was bombed by an unknown individual. Reed Richards is presumed to be dead. In &quot;Ultimate X-Men/Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #1, a young Franklin Richards is part of a future team of X-Men. It is also revealed that in all of the possible futures, Franklin is Reed and Sue&#x27;s son. In &quot;Ultimate Mystery&quot; #3, Reed Richards is revealed to be alive and is seen aiding or leading the aliens to pillage the artifacts stored at Project Pegasus. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Reed Richards&#x27; world view has changed, and he has become something more like Kang the Conqueror. Later he assembles part of the Infinity Gauntlet.

===Susan Storm / Invisible Woman===

The eldest child of renowned scientist Franklin Storm, Sue Storm inherited her father&#x27;s genius at an early age. Since early childhood, she has been one of the prodigies studying and working at the Baxter Building, a midtown Manhattan government research lab. Following her father into physics, at age eight she built a sugar-power rocket and accidentally destroyed her father&#x27;s car, after which she changed her focus to &quot;inner space&quot; biology. Romancing brilliant Baxter Building classmate Reed Richards, Sue became a formidable scientist in her own right, earning four doctorates in bio-chemical sciences.

Attending the Nevada desert testing of Reed&#x27;s N-Zone dimensional teleporter, Sue was transported a mere three miles (5 km) into the desert by the device&#x27;s malfunction. She was discovered by former Baxter Building instructor Dr. Arthur Molekevic, who took her to his underground facilities below Manhattan, calmed her, and helped her gain control of her new abilities, while he sent a &quot;monster&quot; to the Baxter Building to retrieve three who had been transformed by the N-Zone experiment. In the company of those three, Susan fled Molekevic and used her invisible protective force field to take them back to the surface.

Making the study of herself and her three partners her new life&#x27;s work, Sue spent months investigating their abilities and charting their powers while improving her own understanding of herself. She has deduced the nature of both Reed and Johnny&#x27;s changes, though her own powers remain unexplained and she is unable to penetrate Ben&#x27;s skin to determine any more detail than his internal fluid pressure. Sue continues to develop her control of her force fields, using them to create pressurized environments at the bottom of the sea, plugging her own throat to prevent swallowing poison gas, and creating &quot;cushions&quot; to catch falling people and objects. Damage to her force fields also causes her mental strain or, in extreme cases (&quot;Ultimate Power&quot; #5), to black out.

Susan has proven capable of standing her own, and after the team went public, she assumed the codename &quot;Invisible Woman.&quot; Her force fields have been the Four&#x27;s ace in the hole, saving their lives when Nihil dumped Reed and Ben into the near-vacuum of the N-Zone and single-handedly stopping the time-traveling Chrono-Bandits. She co-created the chrono-tunnel with Reed, and has conducted biological studies of the Kree alien Mahr Vehl and extra-dimensional life in the N-Zone.

Though her newfound fame has brought her unsought attention from the likes of billionaire playboy Tony Stark and the Atlantian criminal Namor, she remains romantically attached to Reed despite her concerns about his over devotion to science. As it was shown in &quot;Ultimate Secret&quot; #2, she&#x27;s also more sexually forward than her original counterpart.

Sue has the power to render herself and others invisible to the naked eye. She also has the power to generate nearly impenetrable invisible force fields. Sue can manipulate her force fields in a variety of ways, including levitating herself and others, firing destructive force-blasts, and causing objects to explode by projecting and expanding force fields inside them.

===Benjamin Grimm / Thing===

Gifted physically as a youth, Ben Grimm is Reed&#x27;s best &quot;and only&quot; friend. When they were in school together, Ben would protect Reed from various bullies, including ones &quot;three years younger&quot;, and in exchange Reed would help Ben with his math homework. Ben moved on to college and was invited to watch Reed&#x27;s teleportation experiment. Grimm woke up as the Thing in Mexico City. The teleportation through the N-Zone gave him an orange rocky hide which boosts his strength and makes him nigh-invulnerable to physical damage and physiologically stressful conditions (such as a toxic breathing environment), and he no longer feels differences in temperature. Despite Ben&#x27;s seeming happy-go-lucky disposition, the transformation has caused deep psychological trauma. In the &quot;Diablo&quot; arc, he is briefly transformed to blue. At the end of &quot;Ultimate Doomsday&quot;, Sue proposes to him and he accepts.

After &quot;Ultimatum&quot; and the dissolution of the Fantastic Four, Ben approached General Ross and asked to enlist in the Air Force. In &quot;Ultimate Enemy&quot; #1, he returns to the Baxter Building to see Sue, and confesses that he is in love with her. Ben never acted on it because of Reed. Ben also developed the ability to turn into a purple-skinned glowing form and back again at will.

===Johnny Storm / Human Torch===

Susan Storm&#x27;s younger brother is a short-tempered teen, who is enamored with good-looking girls and has a rock-star attitude. The obvious &quot;cool factor&quot; of his powers only serves to heighten these personality traits: Johnny&#x27;s powers engulf him in flames that enable him to fly and shoot fiery projectiles. This power sometimes has detrimental effects on his body, as Johnny burns, or more accurately fuses, his own body-fat to provide his &#x27;fuel&#x27;, and every so often, he &quot;hibernates&quot; and sheds off the skin cells that protect him from his own flames, growing new ones. Regardless, he finds the idea of being a real superhero incredibly exciting and firmly intends to sign up with The Ultimates once he is old enough, rather than continue hanging around the Baxter Building with the nerds and geeks. He is indeed a high school dropout and a Spider-Man fan (he makes a guest appearance in the &quot;Superstars&quot; arc).

After witnessing his father die in the Ultimatum wave, Johnny has a breakdown at the Statue of Liberty and was captured by the demon Dormammu. Sue and Ben save him, and after Franklin Storm&#x27;s funeral he leaves for Europe. In &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot; #1, Johnny shows up on Peter Parker&#x27;s doorstep, and Aunt May chooses to let him stay with them.

===Team history===
Up until the middle of the series&#x27; second year, the team did not use the above code names, nor were they referred to as &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;. The lack of code names was a frequent source of humor for then writer Warren Ellis, who frequently had Sue, Ben and especially Johnny give themselves outlandish names like &quot;Invisible Ninja-Girl&quot;, &quot;Asbestos Thing&quot;, and &quot;Human Dashboard Lighter&quot;. In the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; &quot;Superstars&quot; arc and the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; game, Johnny was referred as Human Torch and in the game, the team was the &quot;world-famous&quot; Fantastic Four.

==Villains==
* Rhona Burchill: Rhona was a genius from birth, displaying an incredible intellect but severe mental problems. While being extremely bright, she would always cause trouble at any school she went to. Rhona was tested as an applicant for the Baxter Building&#x27;s young think-tank, but did not pass the test primarily due to her troubled psych profile. Reed Richards was welcomed in her place. Desiring to prove her worth, Rhona accelerated her brain&#x27;s processing speed to 600% beyond the normal, and she also surgically attached her brother&#x27;s brain matter to her own to increase her own brain&#x27;s capacity. The experiment horribly deformed Rhona&#x27;s appearance (this deformity was absent in &quot;Ultimate X4&quot;). She is the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s Mad Thinker, as evidenced by her declaration that, &quot;if it is mad to think the unthinkable, then I&#x27;m the maddest thinker there ever was&quot;. She has also constructed her own version of The Awesome Android which appeared when she later stole Cerebro in order to improve her own intellect, but was defeated by a coalition of X-Men and Fantastic Four members. She is presumed dead after her vehicle exploded while trying to flee the scene.
* Diablo: An evil alchemist who kidnaps the Fantastic Four&#x27;s friends and family to lure the Four into the past so that he may use their elemental powers to make himself immortal.
* Victor Van Damme / Doctor Doom: Victor Van Damme was also a member of the youth research project that recruited Reed and Susan, and sees science as an art as opposed to Reed&#x27;s view of it as a system. Van Damme is a descendant of Vlad Tepes, better known as Dracula, ruler of Wallachia during the fifteenth century. As such, Van Damme is a member of European aristocracy and since his youth has also been a member of a secret society bent on achieving covert world domination. Van Damme saw the project as a means of achieving personal power. Van Damme worked with Richards on his device to teleport organic matter to the N-Zone. But on the day of the teleporter&#x27;s full-scale test, Van Damme, arrogantly believing Reed&#x27;s coordinates were incorrect, reprogrammed the coordinates of the device. Van Damme was also affected by the experiment: Most of his body was transformed into metal, his legs were reshaped into cloven hooves and his internal organs were converted into a toxic substance. Soon afterward, he returned to Latveria and led it from poverty to prosperity, changing his name to Doctor Doom. He proceeded to invest in the exploration of Atlantis, gleaning many spells and superior technology from it. He used one such spell to plant a world-threatening parasite in Johnny Storm, in order to force Reed Richards to ask Doom for help.
* Frightful Four: Hailing from the Marvel Zombies universe, the undead version of the Fantastic Four transported themselves into the Ultimate universe by tricking Ultimate Reed Richards into opening a dimensional portal. The Zombie Earth had run out of people to eat, and the zombified Fantastic Four were desperate for more. They were captured upon their arrival by their Ultimate counterparts The Thing, Human Torch, and Invisible Woman. The zombies&#x27; only goal is to spread the infection of the &quot;super-virus&quot; they carry onto the heroes of the Ultimate universe, the only obstacle being their confinement within a reinforced holding cell in the Baxter Building. They eventually escaped, but were swiftly quarantined within the top forty levels of the building. They used a lab to reconfigure a portal to the Zombie universe in order to receive the assistance they needed to break through the shields around the Baxter Building. Ultimate Reed, in Doctor Doom&#x27;s body, attacked them all. The zombie Human Torch was covered in Doom&#x27;s concrete-like vomit, the Thing&#x27;s arms were ripped off, and the Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic were both defeated with one spell apiece. The Four were thrown through the portal back into the Zombie Universe.
* Gallowglass: The son of Thanos. A powerful warrior made from neutron-degenerate matter, a type of material found in the hearts of suns. This makes him incredibly strong and dense and, when he lowers his personal force field, it is &#x27;spectacularly explosive&#x27;. He is seemingly killed by Susan Storm when she makes her force-field touch his, dissolving them both, causing Gallowglass to explode.
* Dr. Arthur Molekevic / Mole Man: Dr. Molekevic was performing forbidden experiments when he was expelled from the Baxter Building. It is suggested those experiments involve the creation of artificial sentient life forms from plant tissue. Molekevic was revealed to be schizophrenic, hearing voices in his head that he refers to as &quot;they&quot;. After he was expelled, Molekevic disappeared into an underground realm where he established himself as the ruler. The name &quot;Mole Man&quot; is a name the students at the think tank would tease him with, due to his skin problems. At the end of his first encounter with the Fantastic Four he fell into a deep pit and was not seen again until his appearance in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #2.
* Namor: Namor was a mutant member of the Atlantean empire, but was imprisoned for unknown reasons. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, he is an outright villain rather than an anti-hero. In their first encounter, the Fantastic Four misinterpret the writing on his prison, mistaking it for a tomb, and that he is a prince and not a criminal. They release him, and after a short battle in which he defeats Johnny, and Ben knocks him out, the Fantastic Four take him back to the Baxter Building. He has romantic desires for Sue like his 616 counterpart, but becomes violent when she rejects his advances. His powers include super strength, flight, teleporting, summoning water elementals and the ability to survive underwater. He is extremely arrogant, and is referred to by Reed Richards as &quot;possibly the most powerful metahuman on Earth&quot;. His extreme intelligence allows him to become fluent in English in a matter of minutes merely by listening to S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the Fantastic Four talking.
* Nihil: Nihil is the transliterated name of the magistrate of a small alien community from within the N-Zone. The N-Zone is a universe in a state of slow entropic heat death, and Nihil&#x27;s community consists of aliens who have gathered their spacecraft close to a dying sun for warmth. Nihil&#x27;s unidentified species is apparently long-lived and he is, as such, frustrated that his universe will die long before he will reach the limits of his life expectancy. He wants to flee the dying N-Zone and claim the young new universe that Reed and his friends hail from. He follows the Fantastic Four to Earth, but is killed while attempting to dislodge a plasma gun from his mouth. He is the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s Annihilus.
* Super-Skrull: The Skrull leader whose &quot;anti-assassination suit&quot; gives him the ability to mimic powers of anyone within a radius. His Skrull pills can give anyone superpowers, but they have a lethal side effect when activated. It is implied the Skrulls have conquered many worlds using the same Skrull pill. He is defeated by a non-superpowered Ben Grimm when he is the only human left on Earth but as he does not have any superpowers, the Super Skrull cannot mimic them. Out of his suit, he is seen as very fragile and begs Ben not to leave him as he will surely die in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere without his suit. He says that he is over a billion years old.
* Thanos: The ruler of the Acheron Empire. He seems to be very powerful and rules thousands of worlds with an iron fist. He desires the creation of a Cosmic Cube so that he can erase the will of any who would oppose him. To this end, he has sought out Reed Richards, believing that Richards is capable of constructing the object.

<text>Maurice Baring (27 April 1874 – 14 December 1945) was an English man of letters, known as a dramatist, poet, novelist, translator and essayist, and also as a travel writer and war correspondent, with particular knowledge of Russia. During World War I, Baring served in the Intelligence Corps and Royal Air Force.

==Life and writings==
Baring was the eighth child, and fifth son, of Edward Charles Baring, first Baron Revelstoke, of the Baring banking family, and his wife Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel, granddaughter of the second Earl Grey. Born in Mayfair, he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After an abortive start of a diplomatic career, he travelled widely, particularly in Russia, where he lived in 1905–06. He reported as an eye-witness of the Russo-Japanese War for the London &quot;Morning Post&quot;. On returning to London he lived at North Cottage, 6 North Street, Westminster.

At the start of World War I he joined the Royal Flying Corps, where he served as assistant to David Henderson and Hugh Trenchard in France. Throughout the war he corresponded with Lady Juliet Duff, the widow of Sir Robin Duff, 2nd Baronet of Vaynol, who was killed on 16 October 1914 near Oostnieuwkerke while serving with the 2nd Life Guards. These letters were later published under the title of &quot;Dear Animated Bust: Letters to Lady Juliet Duff&quot;. In 1918, Baring served as a staff officer in the Royal Air Force and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 Birthday Honours. In 1925 Baring received an honorary commission as a wing commander in the Reserve of Air Force Officers. After his death, Trenchard wrote, &quot;He was the most unselfish man I have ever met or am likely to meet. The Flying Corps owed to this man much more than they know or think.&quot;

As an author, Baring wrote poetical dramas earlier in his career (for instance &quot;The Black Prince and Other Poems&quot;, 1902), then a series of books on Russia (such as &quot;Landmarks in Russian Literature&quot;, 1910, and &quot;The Mainsprings of Russia&quot;, 1914). After the war he turned to full time writing and began to write novels. These included &quot;C&quot; (1924), &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1925), &quot;The Coat Without Seams&quot; (1929), &quot;Robert Peckham&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Lonely Lady of Dulwich&quot; (1934). An autobiography, &quot;The Puppet Show of Memory&quot;, came out in 1922, focused on his childhood and youth. From 1925 his publisher William Heinemann issued his works in a Collected Uniform Edition. After living at various London addresses, he moved in 1930 to a small villa in Rottingdean. His last full-scale work was the anthology with commentary &quot;Have You Anything to Declare&quot; (1936). 

He experienced chronic illness during the last years of his life; for his final 15 years, he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was cared for at Beaufort Castle in Scotland, the home of his relative Lady Laura Lovat, from August 1940 until his death.

== Personal life ==
He was widely known socially, to some of the Cambridge Apostles, to The Coterie, and to the literary group associating with G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc in particular. He enjoyed close friendships with Dame Ethel Smyth (who produced a biography of him in 1938) and Enid Bagnold. 

He was an accomplished reader and scholar of the Greek and Latin classics, and fluent in five or six modern languages. His friend the career diplomat Sir Ronald Storrs wrote that Baring was, &quot;equally at home with the greatest writers of English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Latin, and Greek; with the then almost startling additions of Danish and Russian literature.&quot; However he tended to conceal rather than display his learning, and was staunch in his anti-intellectualism with respect to the arts, and a convinced practical joker.

Previously an agnostic, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1909, which he described in his autobiography as &quot;the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted.&quot; Speaking from personal experience, however, he once advised Belloc to &quot;never, never, never talk theology or discuss the Church with those outside it. People simply do not understand what you are talking about and they merely (a) get angry and (b) come to the conclusion that one doesn&#x27;t believe in the thing oneself and that one is simply doing it to annoy.&quot;

==Legacy==
Belloc dedicated three of his books to Baring: &quot;On Nothing and Kindred Subjects&quot;, &quot;Green Overcoat&quot;, and &quot;The Cruise of the Nona&quot;. Baring is also mentioned in &quot;Belloc&#x27;s Cautionary Verses&quot;:

He once gave Virginia Woolf a copy of his book &quot;C&quot;. She was not impressed, writing in her diary: &quot;Second-rate art i.e. C., by Maurice Baring. Within its limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non-existence. He can only do one thing; himself to wit; charming, clean, modest, sensitive Englishman. Outside that radius and it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is—as-it-should be—light, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well-bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned. I could read this for ever, I said. L. said one would soon be sick to death of it&quot;.

The character Horne Fisher, the protagonist of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, a collection of detective stories by G. K. Chesterton, &quot;is generally thought to be based on Chesterton&#x27;s good friend, Maurice Baring&quot;. Although, while &quot;Fisher fits Baring&#x27;s physical description, he is a respected member of the upper class, and he seems to know everybody and everything&quot;, the similarity ends there, Chesterton scholar Dale Ahlquist notes: &quot;By all accounts, the real Baring was a charming, affable gentleman who knew how to laugh and had no fear of making a fool of himself&quot;, while &quot;Horne Fisher is distinctly lacking in both the charm and humour departments.&quot;

The writer Vernon Lee was a friend of Baring. Lee dedicated her 1927 short-story collection &quot;For Maurice: Five Unlikely Stories&quot; to Baring.

<text>Sporting Clube de Braga (; ), commonly known as Sporting de Braga or just Braga, is a Portuguese sports club from the city of Braga. Best known for the men&#x27;s professional football team playing in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football at the Estádio Municipal de Braga, it also has departments for athletics, badminton, basketball, beach soccer, billiards, boccia, boxing, esports, futsal, karate, kickboxing, muay thai, swimming, taekwondo and volleyball.

Founded on 19 January 1921, Braga are nicknamed, &quot;Braguistas&quot;, and &quot;Os Arsenalistas&quot; (The Arsenalists) for the shirt colour that resembles English club Arsenal. Since 2003, Braga have played their home matches at the Estádio Municipal de Braga, which replaced the Estádio 1º de Maio, now used for the club&#x27;s reserve team.

In the 2000s, Braga became one of Portugal&#x27;s most decorated clubs (5th) after the Big Three and has had some success in European competitions, winning the last UEFA Intertoto Cup (the only Portuguese club to do so) in 2008, and reaching the final of the UEFA Europa League in 2011, cultivating the reputation of being the fourth strongest club in Portugal, outside of the Big Three. Domestically, they have also won another 7 domestic trophies: three Taça de Portugal in 1965–66, 2015–16, and in 2020–21, and the Taça da Liga three times in 2012–13, 2019–20 and 2023–24. Braga have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Vitória de Guimarães, with whom they contest the Minho derby.

The club qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League, reaching the competition for the first time in their history, by eliminating Celtic and Sevilla following a 2nd-place finish in the 2009–10 Primeira Liga season. This represented the highest finish in the league in the club&#x27;s history. Moreover, in the 2010s, Braga have cultivated a reputation for spotting and developing young talent, and have remained focused on developing a youth system.

==History==
Existing records say that in 1919, two years before the formal foundation, a group of Braga residents who were sympathisers of the Lisbon-based Sporting Clube de Portugal (Sporting CP) came up with the name Sporting Clube de Braga. The equipment used was also identical to that of Sporting CP. During weekend matches at Campo das Goladas, the friends from Braga wore the classic Sporting CP Stromp kit, with a green and white shirt split down the middle. Influenced by sympathisers of Sport Lisboa e Benfica (Benfica), a solution was found in 1921 to please everyone. The name remained true to Sporting CP, but the kit changed to red and white, in honour of the connection of some of the Braga fans to Lisbon&#x27;s Benfica.

Until 1945, SC Braga imitated Benfica&#x27;s kit. Red shirt, shorts and white socks. That year, at the end of World War II, the club adopted the Arsenal version for their second team, with white sleeves. Braga changed their kits to their current red and white during the 1945–46 season (for the reserve squad) and the 1946–47 season (for the first team). The change, according to one version of the story, was at the behest of their president, José Antunes Guimarães, who had business connections in London and was an Arsenal fan; according to an alternate version, it was József Szabó, Braga&#x27;s Hungarian coach, who asked the president to change the uniform to an Arsenal-style red and white. In 1947, Braga won the Second division title in the new kit, reaching the First division for the first time. Braga even renamed their youth team &quot;Arsenal de Braga&quot;. 

Braga&#x27;s emblem is the city of Braga&#x27;s shield with Mother Mary and baby Jesus with the blue from the city&#x27;s shield changed to red. On the top of the emblem is the golden Mural Crown of Braga, with the name &quot;Sporting Clube de Braga&quot; on it. Many Braga fans have said that Mother Mary gives them luck. The fans of Braga are known as &quot;Arsenalistas&quot; due to their team home kit that resembles that of English club Arsenal. They are also known as &quot;Bracarenses&quot; because of being from the city of Bracari, later named Bracara Augusta, city of Portugal that is now known as Braga.

Aside from the loyalty of its supporters, the Minho derby against Vitória de Guimarães is a match that both sets of fans eagerly await. This match is more than football – it is a way people from the north view each city. The derby is one of Portugal&#x27;s most intense matches, and children under 13 are restricted from entering unless an adult is with them. The rivalry goes back to when the City of Braga was the ancient capital of Gallaecia and the largest Portuguese city by the time the Kingdom of Portugal was formed by Afonso I of Portugal. At that time, Guimarães became the seat of the King and nobility, whereas the city of Braga remained the centre of trade and religious power (the largest city and seat of the Archbishop).

In the 1960s and 1970s, Braga began to climb up the league ladder and eventually participated in the UEFA competitions. Braga&#x27;s recent run of successive European participations began in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup after finishing fifth in the league under Jesualdo Ferreira&#x27;s first full season in the club. In the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, the side reached the last 16 before a 6–4 aggregate loss to Tottenham Hotspur. That summer, the club signed a three-year sponsorship deal with French insurance company Axa, who took over the naming rights for the stadium for €4.5 million; this was renewed for a further three years in 2010.

Braga won the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup and again reached the UEFA Cup last 16 in the 2008–09 season, where they lost by a single goal to Paris Saint-Germain.

Braga was runners-up in the league for the only time in its history in the 2009–10 season under Domingos Paciência. Entering the UEFA Champions League for the first time, in the fourth qualifying round Braga beat Sevilla 1–0 at home and 4–3 away, thus making the group stage. On 15 September 2010, Braga were heavily defeated 6–0 by Arsenal in its first group stage match. Eliminated in third place, they dropped into the Europa League and reached the final in Dublin, where they lost to a goal by FC Porto&#x27;s Radamel Falcao.

Braga won the Taça da Liga for the first time in 2013 under José Peseiro, with one goal from Alan against Porto. Two years later, Sérgio Conceição&#x27;s side lost on penalties to Sporting CP in the Taça de Portugal final, but Paulo Fonseca&#x27;s triumphed over Porto on the same method in 2016 to win their first such cup in 50 years.

In 2019–20, Braga went through four managers over the course of the season. The second of these, Ruben Amorim, led them to a league cup victory over Porto, with Ricardo Horta scoring in added time to secure the trophy on home soil.

On 28 July 2020, Carlos Carvalhal was announced as the new head coach, after 14 years away from the club. He led the club to the league cup final again, where they lost to Amorim&#x27;s new team Sporting, but won the 2021 Taça de Portugal Final 2–0 against Benfica. He would leave the club and be replaced by Artur Jorge after the 2021–22 season ended.

On 10 October 2022, 21.67% of the club shares were bought for €80 million by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), a subsidiary of Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the state-run sovereign-wealth fund in Qatar owned by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, who is also the owner of Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain through the QSI. The season ended with third place and a return to the Champions League after 11 years, as well as club records for points (78), wins (25) and goals (75).

SC Braga&#x27;s considerable success in the first quarter of the 21st century, including participations in the UEFA Champions League, winning the Taça de Portugal (Portuguese Cup) for the second time in 2016 and the third in 2021, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2011, which they lost to fellow Portuguese side FC Porto and the inauguration of the &quot;Cidade Desportiva&quot;, newly built SC Braga&#x27;s state-of-the-art facilities, improved it on the UEFA club rankings and Portugal&#x27;s professional football landscape to such an extent that SC Braga started to be dubbed the fourth greatest football club in Portugal and regarded as a big club together with the well-established classic Big Three.

== Rivalries ==

=== Rivalry with Vitória SC ===
The Minho derby is the football rivalry between Sporting Clube de Braga and Vitória Sport Clube, two of the biggest clubs in the Minho region of northern Portugal. This derby is marked by great tension and passion, reflecting not only sporting competition, but also a historical and cultural rivalry between the cities of Braga and Guimarães that began even before the formation of the Kingdom of Portugal. Since then it has been a struggle in all aspects of society, sport, culture, the economy... Football has only become a means used to transpose the rivalry. Considered to be one of the most exciting and fiercely contested matches in Portuguese football, the Dérbi Minhoto is eagerly awaited by the fans, who live intensely for the clash between these two cities traditionally known for their history and identity.

=== Other rivalries ===
There is also a certain rivalry between Braga, Boavista, Belenenses and Vitória SC, due to the closeness in the number of titles and because they are some of the clubs with the largest number of fans in Portugal, with many people creating arguments to determine which would be the &quot;4th big&quot;. However, the distance between these clubs and the Big Three is considerable enough in any sport to be given such a designation.

<text>Brian Keenan (born 28 September 1950) is an Irish writer whose work includes the book &quot;An Evil Cradling&quot;, an account of the four and a half years he spent as a hostage in Beirut, Lebanon from 11 April 1986 to 24 August 1990.

==Life==
Keenan was born into a working-class family in East Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1950. He left Orangefield School early and began work as a heating engineer. However, he continued an interest in literature by attending night classes and in 1970 gained a place at the University of Ulster in Coleraine. Other writers there at that time included Gerald Dawe and Brendan Hamill who were collectively known subsequently as the Coleraine Cluster. In the mid 1980s Keenan returned to the Magee College campus of the university for postgraduate study. Afterwards he accepted a teaching position at the American University of Beirut, where he worked for about four months.

==Hostage==
On the morning of 11 April 1986, Keenan was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad. After spending two months in isolation, he was moved to a cell shared with the British journalist John McCarthy. He was kept blindfolded throughout most of his ordeal and was chained hand and foot when he was taken out of solitary.

The British and American governments at the time had a policy that they would not negotiate with terrorists, and Keenan was considered by some to have been ignored by them. Because he was travelling on both Irish and British passports, the Irish government made numerous diplomatic representations for his release, working closely with the Iranian government. Throughout the kidnap they also provided support to his two sisters, Elaine Spence and Brenda Gillham, who were spearheading the campaign for Brian&#x27;s release. He was released from captivity to Syrian military forces on 24 August 1990 and was driven to Damascus. There he was handed over by the Syrian Foreign Ministry to the care of Irish Ambassador, Declan Connolly. His sisters were flown by Irish military executive jet to Damascus to meet him and bring him home to Northern Ireland. 

In 1993, he married Audrey Doyle, a physiotherapist. They have two children and live in Dublin.

He returned to Beirut in 2007 for the first time since being released 17 years earlier. He wrote of the trip, &quot;I couldn’t say I was happy and excited to be back – it was far more than that. I was falling in love.&quot;

==Works==
&quot;An Evil Cradling&quot; is an autobiographical book by Keenan about his four years as a hostage in Beirut. The book revolves heavily around the great friendship he experienced with fellow hostage John McCarthy, and the brutality that was inflicted upon them by their captors. It was the 1991 winner of the &quot;Irish Times&quot; Literature Prize for Non-fiction and the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize.

It was also enthusiastically reviewed. Sebastian Faulks in the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; said &quot;The scope and grandeur of his reflections is supported by the concrete detail of his narrative. It is a moving and remarkable triumph.&quot; In the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, Frank McGuinness claimed that &quot;From the horror has come something wonderful. &quot;An Evil Cradling&quot; is a great book... With the publication of &quot;An Evil Cradling&quot;, Brian Keenan is not letting the world forget. This is a mighty achievement by a magnificent writer&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; called it &quot;Scriptural in its resonances and its broad artistry, while being as gripping as an airport thriller&quot; and John Simpson stated that it was &quot;Unforgettable... a remarkable achievement&quot;

&quot;An Evil Cradling&quot; was adapted into a 2003 film, &quot;Blind Flight&quot;.

<text>SAS (previously &quot;Statistical Analysis System&quot;) is a statistical software suite developed by SAS Institute for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, criminal investigation, and predictive analytics. SAS&#x27; analytical software is built upon artificial intelligence and utilizes machine learning, deep learning and generative AI to manage and model data. The software is widely used in industries such as finance, insurance, health care and education.

SAS was developed at North Carolina State University from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the introduction of JMP. A point-and-click interface was added in version 9 in 2004. A social media analytics product was added in 2010.

==Technical overview and terminology==
SAS is a software suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve data from a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it. SAS provides a graphical point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more through the SAS language.

SAS programs have DATA steps, which retrieve and manipulate data, PROC (procedures) which analyze the data, and may also have functions. Each step consists of a series of statements.

The DATA step has executable statements that result in the software taking an action, and declarative statements that provide instructions to read a data set or alter the data&#x27;s appearance. The DATA step has two phases: compilation and execution. In the compilation phase, declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified. Afterwards, the execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially. Data sets are organized into tables with rows called &quot;observations&quot; and columns called &quot;variables&quot;. Additionally, each piece of data has a descriptor and a value.

PROC statements call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses, and graphics. There are more than 300 named procedures and each one performs a substantial body of statistical work. PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.

SAS macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks.

SAS data can be published in HTML, PDF, Excel, RTF and other formats using the Output Delivery System, which was first introduced in 2007. SAS Enterprise Guide is SAS&#x27;s point-and-click interface. It generates code to manipulate data or perform analysis without the use of the SAS programming language.

The SAS software suite has more than 200 add-on packages, sometimes called components Some of these SAS components, i.e. add on packages to Base SAS include:

==History==

===Origins===
The development of SAS started in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program his analysis of variance and regression software so that it would run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health. and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields. Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software&#x27;s statistical routines, and the two became project leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH only wanted to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe computers for use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software&#x27;s econometrics, time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS&#x27; early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS&#x27;s first documentation.

The first versions of SAS, from SAS 71 to SAS 82, were named after the year in which they were released. In 1971, SAS 71 was published as a limited release. It was used only on IBM mainframes and had the main elements of SAS programming, such as the DATA step and the most common procedures, i.e. PROCs. The following year a full version was released as SAS 72, which introduced the MERGE statement and added features for handling missing data or combining data sets. The development of SAS has been described as an &quot;inflection point&quot; in the history of artificial intelligence. In 1976, Barr, Goodnight, Sall, and Helwig removed the project from North Carolina State and incorporated it as the SAS Institute, Inc.

===Development===
SAS was redesigned in SAS 76. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM mainframes. Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was the FORMAT procedure, which allowed developers to customize the appearance of data. In 1979, SAS 79 added support for the IBM VM/CMS operating system and introduced the DATASETS procedure. Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.

Beginning with SAS 4, released in 1984, SAS releases have followed a sequential naming convention not based on year of release. SAS version 4 had limited features, but made SAS more accessible. Version 5 introduced a complete macro language, array subscripts, and a full-screen interactive user interface called Display Manager. In 1985, SAS was rewritten in the C programming language. This enabled the SAS&#x27; MultiVendor Architecture which allows the software to run on UNIX, MS-DOS, and Windows. It was previously written in PL/I, Fortran, and assembly language.

In the 1980s and 1990s, SAS released a number of components to complement Base SAS. SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, as well as the SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and time series analysis. A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The Food and Drug Administration standardized on using SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002. Vertical products like SAS Financial Management and SAS Human Capital Management (then called CFO Vision and HR Vision respectively) were also introduced.

JMP was developed by SAS co-founder John Sall and a team of developers, in order to take advantage of the graphical user interface introduced in the 1984 Apple Macintosh. JMP&#x27;s name originally stood for &quot;John&#x27;s Macintosh Project&quot;. JMP was shipped for the first time in 1989. Updated versions of JMP were released continuously after 2002 with the most recent release in 2016. In January 2022, JMP became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAS Institute, having previously been a business unit of the company.

SAS 6 was used throughout the 1990s and was available on a wider range of operating systems, including Macintosh, OS/2, Silicon Graphics, and PRIMOS. SAS introduced new features through dot-releases. From 6.06 to 6.09, a user interface based on the Windows paradigm was introduced and support for SQL was added. Version 7 introduced the Output Delivery System (ODS) and an improved text editor. Subsequent releases improved upon the ODS. For example, more output options were added in version 8. The number of operating systems that were supported was reduced to UNIX, Windows and z/OS, and Linux was added. SAS 8 and SAS Enterprise Miner were released in 1999.

===Recent history===
In 2002, SAS Text Miner software was introduced. Text Miner analyzes text data like emails for patterns in business intelligence applications. In 2004, SAS Version 9.0 was released, referred to as &quot;Project Mercury&quot; internally, and was designed to make SAS accessible to a broader range of business users. SAS 9.0 added custom user interfaces based on the user&#x27;s role and established the point-and-click user interface of SAS Enterprise Guide as the software&#x27;s primary graphical user interface (GUI). The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) features were improved in 2004 with SAS Interaction Management. In 2008, SAS announced Project Unity, designed to integrate data quality, data integration, and master data management.

SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd was a lawsuit with developers of a competing implementation, World Programming System, alleging that they had infringed SAS&#x27;s copyright in part by implementing the same functionality. The case was referred by the United Kingdom&#x27;s High Court of Justice to the European Court of Justice on 11 August 2010. In May 2012, the European Court of Justice ruled in favor of World Programming, finding that &quot;the functionality of a computer program and the programming language cannot be protected by copyright.&quot;

A free version of SAS was introduced for students in 2010. SAS Social Media Analytics, a tool for social media monitoring, engagement and sentiment analysis, was also released that year. SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler (RPM), which creates basic analytical models using Microsoft Excel, was introduced the same year. In 2010, JMP 9 included a new interface for using the R programming language and an add-in for MS Excel. The following year, a High Performance Computing platform was made available in a partnership with Teradata and EMC Greenplum. In 2011, the company released SAS Enterprise Miner 7.1. The company introduced 27 data management products from October 2013 to October 2014 and updates to 160 others. At the SAS Global Forum 2015, SAS announced several new products that were specialized for different industries, as well as new training software.

The company has invested in the development of artificial general intelligence, or &quot;strong AI&quot;, with the goal of advancing deep learning and natural language processing to the point of achieving cognitive computing.

In 2019, SAS announced that it would be investing $1 billion into the development of advanced artificial intelligence, deep learning, natural language processing and machine learning. It announced an additional $1 billion investment into these areas in 2023, particularly for industries such as finance, insurance, government, health care and energy. In September 2023, the company announced its expansion of research into the applications of generative AI in analytics, data management and modeling.

==Software products==
As of 2011, SAS&#x27;s largest set of products was its line for customer intelligence. Numerous SAS modules for web, social media and marketing analytics may be used to profile customers and prospects, predict their behaviors and manage and optimize communications. 

SAS also provides the SAS Fraud Framework. The framework&#x27;s primary functionality is to monitor transactions across different applications, networks and partners and use analytics to identify anomalies that are indicative of fraud. This software uses artificial intelligence to monitor income and assets. The SAS Asset and Liability Management platform utilizes generative AI and machine learning to monitor risk and model risk management strategies. 

SAS Governance, Risk and Compliance Manager provides risk modeling, scenario analysis, and other functions in order to manage and visualize risk, compliance and corporate policies. There is also a SAS Enterprise Risk Management product-set designed primarily for banks and financial services organizations.

SAS products for monitoring and managing the operations of IT systems are collectively referred to as SAS IT Management Solutions. SAS collects data from various IT assets on performance and utilization, then creates reports and analyses. SAS&#x27;s Performance Management products consolidate and provide graphical displays for key performance indicators (KPIs) at the employee, department and organizational level. 

The SAS Supply Chain Intelligence product suite is offered for supply chain needs, such as forecasting product demand, managing distribution and inventory and optimizing pricing. There is also a &quot;SAS for Sustainability Management&quot; set of software to forecast environmental, social and economic effects and identify causal relationships between operations and their impact on the environment or ecosystem.

SAS has various analytical tools related to risk management. The SAS Asset and Liability Management platform utilizes generative AI and machine learning to monitor risk and model risk management strategies.

SAS has products for specific industries, such as government, retail, telecommunications, aerospace, marketing optimization, and high-performance computing. The company has a suite of analytical products related to health care and life sciences.

===SAS University Edition===
In May 2014, SAS announced the launch of SAS University Edition. This offering could be downloaded free for non-commercial use. In 2022, the SAS University Edition was replaced by two entirely web-based versions: SAS OnDemand for Academics and SAS Viya for Learners.

===Comparison to other products===
In a 2005 article for the &quot;Journal of Marriage and Family&quot; comparing statistical packages from SAS and its competitors Stata and SPSS, Alan C. Acock wrote that SAS programs provide &quot;extraordinary range of data analysis and data management tasks,&quot; but were difficult to learn and use. SPSS and Stata, meanwhile, were both easier to learn but had less capable analytic abilities, though these could be expanded with paid (in SPSS) or free (in Stata) add-ons. Acock concluded that SAS was best for power users, while occasional users would benefit most from SPSS and Stata. A 2014 comparison by the University of California, Los Angeles, gave similar results.

Competitors such as Revolution Analytics and Alpine Data Labs advertise their products as considerably cheaper than SAS&#x27;s. In a 2011 comparison, Doug Henschen of &quot;InformationWeek&quot; found that start-up fees for the three are similar, though he admitted that the starting fees were not necessarily the best basis for comparison. SAS&#x27;s business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs, instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees.

===SAS Viya===
In 2016, SAS Viya, an artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics and data management platform, was introduced with a new architecture optimized for running SAS software in public clouds. Viya also increased interoperability with open source software, allowing models to be built in tools such as R, Python and Jupyter, and then executed on SAS&#x27;s Cloud Analytics Services (CAS) engine. In 2020, a further architectural revamp in Viya 4 containerized the software. SAS sells Viya alongside SAS 9.4, and has not positioned it as a replacement for SAS 9.4.

In 2023, two new software as a service (SaaS) modules for SAS Viya were released as a private preview: Workbench, for use in creating AI models, and App Factory, for use in creating AI applications. Both modules support multiple programming languages and are expected to become generally available in 2024. SAS Viya also became available on Microsoft Azure Marketplace under a pay-as-you-use model in 2023.

In 2023, the company introduced SAS Health, a common health data model built on the SAS Viya platform.

==Adoption==
According to IDC, SAS is the largest market-share holder in &quot;advanced analytics&quot; with 35.4 percent of the market as of 2013. It is the fifth largest market-share holder for business intelligence (BI) software with a 6.9% share and the largest independent vendor. It competes in the BI market against SAP BusinessObjects, IBM Cognos, SPSS Modeler, Oracle Hyperion, and Microsoft Power BI. SAS has been named in the Gartner Leader&#x27;s Quadrant for Data Integration Tools and for Business Intelligence and Analytical Platforms.
A study published in 2011 in &quot;BMC Health Services Research&quot; found that SAS was used in 42.6 percent of data analyses in health service research, based on a sample of 1,139 articles drawn from three journals.

<doc id="990679" wikidata="Q4443319" url="?curid=990679" title="Brontë Country">
<text>Brontë Country is a name given to an area of south Pennine hills west of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England. The name comes from the Brontë sisters, who wrote such literary classics as &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (Charlotte Brontë), &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (Emily Brontë), and &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (Anne Brontë) while living in the area.

==Geology==
The geology of the Brontë country is mainly gritstone.

==Points of interest==
The area includes the village of Haworth, where the Brontë sisters lived, and where the Brontë Parsonage Museum is located today. Top Withens is said to have been the inspiration for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Ponden Hall, which located about half a mile outside Stanbury, is believed to inspire at least two buildings in Brontës&#x27; novels: Thrushcross Grange in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and the eponymous mansion in &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. Thornton, on the outskirts of Bradford, is the birthplace of the Brontë sisters and their brother Branwell (their father was rector of Thornton church). The house where they were born still exists as the Brontë Birthplace and in November 2023 was acquired for restoration and preservation as a cultural and educational space. It is located on Market Street in the centre of the village.

Other places of interest from the Brontë sisters&#x27; novels include Oakwell Hall (Fieldhead in &quot;Shirley&quot;), Red House (Briarmains in &quot;Shirley&quot;), and Gawthorpe Hall and Wycoller Hall (Ferndean Manor in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;).

==In media and culture==
The film &quot;Brontë Country: The Story of the Emily, Charlotte &amp; Anne Brontë&quot; discusses the area&#x27;s geography and history, and the history of the Brontë family.

<text>Egaleo Football Club () is a Greek professional football club based in Aigaleo, a suburban town in the Athens urban area, Greece. Founded in 1946, it uses all documents of previous club (Ierapolis F.C., founded in 1931). The team currently competes in the Super League 2, the second tier of Greek football and it holds home matches at Stavros Mavrothalassitis Stadium.

Club colours are blue and white.

==History==
Egaleo was founded in 1931 by Demetrios Haniotis and Georgios Aronis, as &quot;Athletic Union of Ierapolis&quot; (Αθλητική Ένωση Ιεραπόλεως – Athlitiki Enosis Ieropoleos). In 1946, three other clubs in the district merged with A.E. Ierapoleos to form &quot;Athletic Club Egaleo&quot; (Αθλητικός Όμιλος Αιγάλεω – Athlitikos Omilos Egaleo), which managed to reach for the first time the first division in 1961.

In the 2003–04 season, Egaleo managed its second better ever classification, fifth (fourth in the 1970–71 season), playing UEFA Cup for the first time in 2004–05, appearing in the group stages (after defeating Gençlerbirliği of Turkey 2–1 score on aggregate) with FK Partizan, S.S. Lazio, Middlesbrough and Villarreal CF, which ended with the conquest of just one point. In the league, the club finished sixth, trailing PAOK by just one point.

After a disappointing 2006–07, Egaleo was relegated back to the second level. Another relegation followed in the next year, and a third in 2008–09.

In August 2009, a merger between Egaleo and Ilisiakos F.C. took place, as the other club participated in the second division, with the purchase being made effective by Egaleo&#x27;s owner Thomas Mitropoulos; the new club, which took Ilisiakos&#x27; place, was renamed Egaleo A.O.

At the end of the 2009–10 season, due to the merger being declared illegal by the Greek Council of State, Egaleo FC was relegated to the Delta Ethniki.

<doc id="990689" wikidata="Q6906110" url="?curid=990689" title="Monto">
<text>Monto was the nickname for the one-time red light district in the northeast of Dublin, Ireland. The Monto was roughly the area bounded by Talbot Street, Amiens Street, Gardiner Street and Seán McDermott Street (formerly Gloucester Street) in what would now be called Summerhill. The name is derived from Montgomery Street (now called Foley Street), which runs parallel to the lower end of Talbot Street towards what is now Connolly Station. Montgomery Street is believed to have been named after Elizabeth Montgomery, who was married to Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy.

==History==
In its heyday from the 1860s to the 1950s, there were anything up to 1,600 prostitutes working there at any one time, with all classes of customers catered for. Dublin was reputed to have the biggest red light district in Europe and its profits were aided by the enormous number of British Army garrisons in the city, notably the Royal Barracks (later Collins Barracks and now one of the locations of the National Museum of Ireland).

According to legend, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom lost his virginity in the Monto while still the Prince of Wales. Later, in the 1880s, the Prince, accompanied by his wife Princess Alexandra and their son Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence strolled unrecognised through the area, having slipped away from their bodyguards and walked through Dublin.

===Residents===
In Kevin Kearns&#x27; oral history collection &quot;Dublin Tenement Life&quot;, he comments that many of the prostitutes in the Monto were, like Philomena Lee, unwed mothers who had been disowned both by their families and by their babies&#x27; fathers. Although middle-class Dubliners viewed these women as &#x27;whores&#x27;, the impoverished but devoutly Catholic residents of Monto tenements referred to local prostitutes as &quot;unfortunate girls&quot;, and understood that they had often turned to prostitution as a last resort. According to Kearns, &quot;By all accounts, the girls were typically young, attractive, and known for their generosity, especially to slum children&quot;.

In an interview with Kearns, Mary Corbally, who grew up in a tenement on Corporation Street during the 1920s, recalled, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel any shame in coming from the Monto, but the reputation was there cause of the girls. We never heard the word &#x27;Whores&#x27;, never heard &#x27;Prostitute&#x27;. Very rarely you&#x27;d hear of a brothel, it was a &#x27;kip&#x27; and the madams we called them, &#x27;kip-keepers&#x27;. But the girls were very good, they were generous. They were very fond of kids. If you went for a message for them you&#x27;d get a thruppence or a sixpence. If they seen a kid running around in his bare feet they&#x27;d bring him into Brett&#x27;s and buy him a pair of runners... The girls were generous.&quot;

Billy Dunleavy, who grew up in the Monto before, during, and after the Irish War of Independence, later recalled, &quot;It was a hard life for them girls. They were really all country girls that got into trouble and that&#x27;s where they finished up. A girl (unwed) with a baby, she was in trouble... from farmers&#x27; sons. There was a convent around there and they were put up in there for twelve months with the nuns. They had a hard time. Scrubbing floors and everything else and the nuns standing over them. Oh, the country girls got a hell of a time of it, that&#x27;s why all the girls was, &#x27;on the town&#x27;. That&#x27;s where they finished up. Now the madams had them dressed up in good new clothes, that was the attraction.&quot;

According to Kearns, &quot;The madams, several of whom became legendary figures in Dublin folklore, were Dublin women. They were tough, shrewd businesswomen who ruled the roost in a strict maternal manner. They clothed their girls, housed them, and took a high percentage of their earnings. Many of the kip-houses also illegally sold drink which made it easier to part a man from his money... Several madams became quite wealthy, wore expensive jewels, owned cars, and even sent their children off to prestigious schools abroad. Some were possessive of their girls to the point of keeping them virtually housebound for periods.&quot;

According to Billy Dunleavy, however, &quot;But when they got the money off the men and didn&#x27;t give it up to the madams they took the clothes off them - stripped! They&#x27;d &quot;strip&quot; them, take all their clothes off them and put them up in the rooms in the houses. They had a bad &quot;occupation&quot; but they were very decent, very, very kind, the girls. You wouldn&#x27;t hear them cursing and they might give the boy a penny or tuppence to buy sweets. Respectable girls. The wives around here would even say &#x27;hello,&#x27; to them and be friendly enough. But we had a hospital here then called the Locke, over here on Townsend Street, and you know what they used to do with the girls (with sexual diseases)? Smother them. When they had syphilis and all... &quot;incurable&quot;! They used to be smothered. See, there was no such thing as pills at that time. They couldn&#x27;t cure them. Smother them to take them out of their pain, or give them some kind of a needle. They were so far gone and at that time there was no cure. The hospital was built for that purpose. That&#x27;s right. They wouldn&#x27;t do them all, just an odd one. They&#x27;d be nearly dead before they&#x27;d do it.&quot;

In an interview with Kearns, Johnny Campbell, who had been a legendary Monto brawler in his youth, &quot;Now there were also mobs fighting against one another, animal gangs. There were four gangs that used to go against one another - Stafford Street, Ash Street, Sheriff Street, and here, the Monto. Most of the animal gangs was dockers, nearly all of them. The dockers were the toughest men in Dublin. Ah, they &quot;were&quot; because they were going through the mill themselves with the big guns of coal and everything. And, oh, my God, they could put away maybe twenty pints... The coal dust and all. Now there could be a big melee on a Saturday night near Paddy Clare&#x27;s or Jack Maher&#x27;s (pubs). There could be twenty men fighting. They&#x27;d have razor blades and iron bars and knuckle-dusters and flick knives and hooks off the bales for the dock work. And you might see a fella taking off his belt and start swinging it. Like McCauley, he was a ringleader in the Monto, and he got his eyes taken out by a fella named Browne who hit him with a belt, took his eyes out. Browne got nine months.&quot;

Also according to Billy Dunleavy, &quot;The kip houses were ordinary houses but you&#x27;d see the men going in and out, in and out. Oh, men&#x27;d come in with big cars and all. Big shots... businessmen, British soldiers, officers in the Army, British &quot;Generals&quot;. Big shots! It was safe enough. Men wouldn&#x27;t stay all night. But some of the girls would &quot;rob&quot; them. Got &#x27;em drunk. Take his trousers away from him and take his money. And the kip-houses had bouncers - whore&#x27;s bullies we called them - and if a man didn&#x27;t give up his money he&#x27;d get a hiding.&quot;

===War of Independence===
The Monto was also a major hive of IRA activity during the Irish War of Independence.

Billy Dunleavy further recalls, &quot;The IRA were the best men we ever had at that time. The Tans used to go around in the tenders with a wire over the top and if it was going by up there in Talbot Street they&#x27;d (IRA) say, &#x27;Get out of the way, &quot;quick&quot;!&#x27; and they&#x27;d throw a hand grenade into the car. Now Phil Shanahan, he owned a pub over there on the corner, he was a great man and he used to hide them after they&#x27;d been out on a job. He had cellars and all the IRA men used to go there and hide their stuff. But nobody &quot;knew&quot; who an IRA man was. Oh, no, you wouldn&#x27;t know who an IRA man was around here at that time at all. They were all very secret. They &quot;had&quot; to be that way. Your neighbour could be an IRA man. On a Saturday morning, this big fella, he used to give information - he was an &quot;informer&quot; against the IRA - and two men came around that morning and riddled him in the public house, riddled him with bullets. The IRA killed him. But they were good men and they wouldn&#x27;t kill any innocent people.&quot;

Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty (December 1921), the establishment of the Irish Free State (6 December 1922), and the withdrawal of the British Army garrison from Dublin, the financial viability of the kip-houses was severely damaged.

===Campaign and Dublin Metropolitan Police raid===
Between 1923 and 1925, Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary, and Fr. R.S. Devane launched a campaign, in defiance of the Crypto-Calvinist, or Jansenistic view by the Archbishop of Dublin and the middle class that fallen women should just be written off as whores, to empty the &quot;kip-houses&quot; and clean up The Monto. Similarly to St. Vitalis of Gaza, Duff and the Legion of Mary began a covert spiritual outreach to the &quot;unfortunate girls&quot; in the Monto and established the Sancta Maria hostel, a safe house for the growing number of prostitutes whom they helped to run away from their &quot;kip keepers&quot; and start a new life.

Duff also received the co-operation of the first Catholic Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, former Irish Army General W.R.E. Murphy. The campaign ended with 120 arrests and Gen. Murphy announced the closure of all the remaining kip-houses following a DMP raid on 12 March 1925.

===Post-1925 raid===
However, kip-houses continued to exist in the Monto, long after the 1925 raid. This was enabled by both political corruption and bribery of the Irish Police, or Garda Síochána, well into the 1950s. According to Billy Dunleavy, &quot;The Guards knew what was going on, but they couldn&#x27;t do anything. But if the kip-houses were selling bottles of stout the Guards could get the bottles and break them up. See, there were manholes out there, where the water goes down. And they&#x27;d (kip-owners) put the bottles of stout down the manhole when the police&#x27;d be coming. Now your bottle of stout at that time was only around eight pence but if a man brought a girl to Becky Cooper&#x27;s kip they&#x27;d be charged about a &quot;pound&quot; for that bottle. The police knew where the porter&#x27;s be hid and they&#x27;d raid and take them up and break them.&quot;

These kip-houses included the &quot;Cozy Kitchen&quot; on North King Street and &quot;Cafe Continental&quot; on Bolton Street, both of which were run by legendary Dublin madam Dolly Fawcett and remained open, enabled by corruption in the Garda Síochána, well into the 1950s.

According to Northside resident Noelle Hughes, who knew Dolly Fawcett in her seventies, &quot;The Cozy Kitchen&quot; was located in the basement of a tenement house at 2 North King Street and was run by Dolly&#x27;s son Stephen Fawcett until it closed down in 1957. Dolly&#x27;s other son ran the Cafe Continental on Bolton Street. According to retired Guard Paddy Casey, the Cafe Continental was located next to the Bolton Street Technical School.

Hughes later recalled, &quot;The girls would be around the place, at the counter, and a man would start chatting them up. They were mostly country girls up from the country, from seventeen into their thirties. They weren&#x27;t high class prostitutes or anything like that, they were just ordinary commoners. I suppose they charged about two pounds. They&#x27;d bring the blokes off to a flat. Or take him around a laneway or around the back, somewhere like that. The whole neighbourhood know of this - the whole of &quot;Dublin&quot; knew about it cause the sailors off the ships used to go in there an awful lot. Men, they&#x27;d come from the docks and all over. It was mostly all outsiders cause the men in the tenements didn&#x27;t have money.&quot;

Hughes continues, &quot;And the police raided it a couple of times but they got backhands. Oh, there was backhands going on all the time, paying policemen off. And there was a bit of an argument a couple times about closing it down but nothing ever materialised of it. And then it eventually closed up and the Fawcetts went off to England.&quot;

==In popular culture==

===Folk songs===
* The Irish folk song &quot;Monto (Take Her Up to Monto)&quot; was written by George Desmond Hodnett in 1958 and popularised by The Dubliners several years later. Irish singer Róisín Murphy named her 2016 album &quot;Take Her Up to Monto&quot; in reference to the song. 
* Monto is also twice mentioned in the Irish folk song &quot;Waxies&#x27; Dargle&quot;. 
* It is referred to repeatedly in the Pete St. John song &quot;Johnny McGory&quot; (also popularised by The Dubliners). 
* Monto, Frank Duff, and the L.O.M. are also mentioned in the Peter Yeates song &quot;Honor Bright&quot;, the story of the 1925 murder of a prostitute (Lizzie O&#x27;Neil) who used the pseudonym &quot;Honour Bright&quot;. The song is sung at the top of Act Two of &quot;The Ferryman&quot; by Jez Butterworth as the Carney boys come in from the harvest. In 2019 Pierce Turner included a version on his collection of traditional songs, &quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;.

===Literature===
* The Monto was immortalised as &quot;Nighttown&quot; in the &quot;Circe&quot; chapter of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, in which protagonists Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus visit a kip-house together.
* Catherine Ann Cullen has written a poem, &quot;Monto Cross&quot;, on the subject of the Monto.

<doc id="990696" wikidata="Q1182198" url="?curid=990696" title="Dedicated short-range communications">
<text>Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) is a technology for direct wireless exchange of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and other intelligent transportation systems (ITS) data between vehicles, other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.), and roadside infrastructure (traffic signals, electronic message signs, etc.). DSRC, which can be used for both one- and two-way data exchanges, uses channels in the licensed 5.9 GHz band. DSRC is based on IEEE 802.11p.

==History==
In October 1999, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated 75 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for DSRC-based ITS uses. By 2003, DSRC was used in Europe and Japan for electronic toll collection. In August 2008, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) allocated 30 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for ITS.

In November 2020, the FCC reallocated the lower 45 MHz of the 75 MHz spectrum to the neighboring 5.8 GHz ISM band for unlicensed non-ITS uses, citing DSRC&#x27;s lack of adoption. Of the 30 MHz that remained for licensed ITS uses, 10 MHz was kept for DSRC (Channel 180, 5.895–5.905 GHz) and 20 MHz was reserved for a successor to DSRC, LTE-CV2X (Channel 183, 5.905–5.925 GHz).

== Applications ==
Singapore&#x27;s Electronic Road Pricing scheme plans to use DSRC technology for road use measurement (ERP2) to replace its ERP1 overhead gantry method.

In June 2017, the Utah Department of Transportation and the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) demonstrated the use of DSRC for transit signal priority on SR-68 (Redwood Road) in Salt Lake City, whereby several UTA transit buses equipped with DSRC equipment could request changes to signal timing if they were running behind schedule.

Other applications include:
* Emergency warning system for vehicles
* Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control
* Cooperative Forward Collision Warning
* Intersection collision avoidance
* Approaching emergency vehicle warning (Blue Waves)
* Vehicle safety inspection
* Emergency vehicle signal preemption
* Electronic parking payments
* Commercial vehicle clearance and safety inspections
* In-vehicle signing
* Rollover warning
* Probe data collection
* Highway-rail intersection warning
* Electronic toll collection 

== Standardization ==
DSRC systems in Europe, Japan and the U.S. are incompatible and have significant differences, including spectrum and channels (5.8 GHz RF, 5.9 GHz RF, infrared), data transmission rates, and protocols.

The European standardization organisation European Committee for Standardization (CEN), sometimes in co-operation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed some DSRC standards:
* EN 12253:2004 Dedicated Short-Range CommunicationPhysical layer using microwave at 5.8 GHz (review)
* EN 12795:2002 Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC)DSRC Data link layer: Medium Access and Logical Link Control (review)
* EN 12834:2002 Dedicated Short-Range CommunicationApplication layer (review)
* EN 13372:2004 Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC)DSRC profiles for RTTT applications (review)
* EN ISO 14906:2004 Electronic Fee CollectionApplication interface
Each standard addresses different layers in the OSI model communication stack.

<text>Dome C , also known as dôme Circe, Dome Charlie (US) or dôme Concordia, is located at Antarctica at an elevation of above sea level, on one of several domes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Location dome C is on the Antarctic Plateau, inland from the French research station at Dumont D&#x27;Urville, inland from the Australian Casey Station and inland from the Italian Zucchelli Station at Terra Nova Bay. Russia&#x27;s Vostok Station is away. Dome C is the site of the Concordia Research Station, jointly operated by France and Italy.

== History ==

In the 1970s, dome C was the site of ice core drilling by field teams of several nations. Designated Dome Charlie (NATO Phonetic Alphabet code for the letter &quot;C&quot;) by the U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, and its Squadron VXE-6, which provided logistical support to the field teams, in January and November 1975, three LC-130 Hercules aircraft suffered severe damage during attempted takeoffs. In November 1975 and November 1976, the U.S. Navy established field camps on Dome Charlie to recover the aircraft. Following major structural repairs and replacement of engines in the field, the three LC-130s were flown to McMurdo Station on December 26, 1975, January 14, 1976, and December 25, 1976.

From November 1977 to March 1978 a French party of 13 settled down in the existing camp left by the aircraft rescuers. They brought several tons of equipment—thanks to the VXE-6 airplanes—and while there ice-cored down to 980 m extracting samples 45,000 to 50,000 years old.

During the Antarctic summer of 1979, the camp was re-occupied by Americans and French, under the auspices of the US Antarctic Research Program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Deep ice core drilling, meteorology and seismic studies were conducted. The camp, with a maximum summer population of 18, was operated and maintained by four employees of ITT Antarctic Services and one US Navy medical corpsman. When the camp was shut down for the season in about January, 1980, it was left mostly intact, with a radio-isotope powered remote weather station operational.

In 1992, France decided to build a new station on the Antarctic Plateau. The program was later joined by Italy. In 1996, a French-Italian team established a summer camp at dome C. The two main objectives of the camp were the provision of logistical support for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and the construction of a permanent research station. The new all-year facility, Concordia Station, became operational in 2005.

The Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) considers &quot;Dome Charlie&quot; to be superior to the informal name, &quot;dome C,&quot; and that it has precedence over &quot;dome Circe&quot;, a name suggested from Greek mythology after Circe, the bewitching queen of Aeaea island, one of the children of solar god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse, who changed men into animals by magic, by members of the SPRI airborne radio echo sounding team in 1982. Later, it was named &quot;dome Concordia&quot; after that same French/Italian scientific base.

In February 2025, scientists confirmed the successful extraction of the oldest continuous ice core ever with distinct layers of the ice frozen between 900,000 and 1.2-million years ago.

== Climate ==

Dome C is one of the coldest places on Earth. Temperatures hardly rise above in summer and can fall below in winter. The annual average air temperature is . Humidity is low and it is also very dry, with very little or no precipitation throughout the year.

Dome C does not experience the katabatic winds typical of the coastal regions of Antarctica because of its elevated location and its relative distance from the edges of the Antarctic Plateau. Typical wind speed in winter is 2.8 m/s (6 mph).

Dome C is situated on top of the Antarctic Polar Plateau, the world&#x27;s largest frozen desert. No animals or plants live at a distance of more than a few hundred meters from the Southern Ocean. However, south polar skuas have been spotted overflying the station, away from their nearest food sources. It is believed that these seabirds have learned to cross the frozen white continent instead of circumnavigating it.
== Astronomical observatory ==

Dome C is notable for its potential to be an extremely good astronomical observation site; the transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere allows stars to be observed, even when the Sun is at its highest possible elevation angle of 38°. The good viewing is due to very low infrared sky emission, extremely low humidity, a high percentage of cloud-free time, low atmospheric aerosol and dust content, and freedom from light pollution and background light other than auroras and moonlight. This location was a serious candidate for the ESO&#x27;s E-ELT project. However, sky coverage is less than at lower latitude locations as northern celestial hemisphere objects never rise or are too low above the horizon.

The Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific discuss the suitability of the site for astronomy in terms of the seeing. They determined the median seeing (measured with a Differential Image Motion Monitor placed on top of an tower) to be 1.3±0.8 arcseconds. This is significantly worse than most major observatory sites, but similar to other observatories in Antarctica. However, they found (using balloons) that 87% of turbulence was below 36 meters. A telescope built on a tower could rise above this &quot;boundary layer&quot; and achieve excellent seeing. The boundary layer is at the South Pole and may be as low as at Dome A.

An earlier paper considered the site and concluded that &quot;Dome C is the best ground-based site to develop a new astronomical observatory&quot;. This shows a measured superior seeing of 0.27 arcseconds, half as large as at Mauna Kea Observatory. This figure was taken with an instrument insensitive to near-ground turbulence and so it is comparable to the 0.35 arcseconds Agabi et al. measured for &quot;free atmospheric seeing&quot;.

The 2004 experiments to measure the astronomical conditions at the site were unattended, controlled by a computer system that had to supervise the generation of its own electricity using a jet-fuel powered Stirling engine. The computer, running Linux, communicated with the outside world using an Iridium phone.

== ESA research ==
Since Concordia Station is a prime space mission analogue, the European Space Agency conducts biomedical research there in collaboration with the French (IPEV) and Italian (ENEA/PNRA) Antarctic programs. Living conditions upon Dome C simulate what Astronauts have to go through in long-duration spaceflights. To name a few of the common challenges that the Concordia crew and Astronauts have to face, they both live in isolation and confinement, in different atmospheric pressure conditions, with an abnormal day/night cycle plus several effects on their everyday life, such as sleep difficulties. Obviously the above parameters influence not only physiology but also psychology. The European Space Agency (ESA) hires a Medical Doctor each year to winterover at Concordia Station and facilitate biomedical experiments on the crew. These experiments are selected over a variety of tests proposed to ESA by European universities and participation from the rest of the crew is voluntary (and highly appreciated). It is important to mention that this research aims not only at improving living conditions for Astronauts in a future human journey to Mars, but the results are also applied directly on society - they help doctors devise therapies for patients with similar difficulties in Europe and elsewhere.

<doc id="990711" wikidata="Q269975" url="?curid=990711" title="Anthony Mann">
<text>Anthony Mann (born Emil Anton Bundsmann; June 30, 1906 – April 29, 1967) was an American film director and stage actor. He came to prominence as a skilled director of &quot;film noir&quot; and Westerns, and for his historical epics.

Mann started as a theatre actor appearing in numerous stage productions. In 1937, he moved to Hollywood where he worked as a talent scout and casting director. He then became an assistant director, most notably working for Preston Sturges. His directorial debut was &quot;Dr. Broadway&quot; (1942). He directed several feature films for numerous production companies, including RKO Pictures, Eagle-Lion Films, Universal Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). His first major success was &quot;T-Men&quot; (1947), garnering notable recognition for producing several films in the &quot;film noir&quot; genre through modest budgets and short shooting schedules. As a director, he often collaborated with cinematographer John Alton.

During the 1950s, Mann shifted to directing Western films starring several major stars of the era, including James Stewart. He directed Stewart in eight films, including &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot; (1955). While successful in the United States, these films became appreciated and studied among French film critics, several of whom would become influential with the French New Wave. In 1955, Jacques Rivette hailed Mann as &quot;one of the four great directors of postwar Hollywood&quot;. The other three were Nicholas Ray, Richard Brooks, and Robert Aldrich.

By the 1960s, Mann turned to large-scale filmmaking, directing the medieval epic &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren, and &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964). Both films were produced by Samuel Bronston. Mann then directed the war film &quot;The Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965) and the spy thriller &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968). In 1967, Mann died from a heart attack in Berlin before he had finished the latter film; its star Laurence Harvey completed the film, albeit uncredited.

==Early life==
Mann was born Emil Anton Bundsmann in San Diego, California. His father, Emile Theodore Bundsmann, an academic, was born in the village of Rosice, Chrudim, Bohemia to a Sudeten-German Catholic family. His mother, Bertha (née Waxelbaum/Weichselbaum), a drama teacher from Macon, Georgia, was an American of Bavarian Jewish descent. At the time of his birth, Mann&#x27;s parents were members of the Theosophical Society community of Lomaland in San Diego County.

When Mann was three, his parents moved to his father&#x27;s native country Austria to seek treatment for his father&#x27;s ill health, leaving Mann behind in Lomaland. Mann&#x27;s mother did not return for him until he was fourteen, and only then at the urging of a cousin who had paid him a visit and was worried about his treatment and situation at Lomaland. In 1917, Mann&#x27;s family relocated to New York where he developed a penchant for acting. This was reinforced with Mann&#x27;s participation in the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association. He continued to act in school productions, studying at East Orange Grammar and Newark&#x27;s Central High School. At the latter school, he portrayed the title role in &quot;Alcestis&quot;; one of his friends and classmates was future Hollywood studio executive Dore Schary. After his father&#x27;s death in 1923, Mann dropped out during his senior year to help with the family&#x27;s finances.

==Career==
===1925–1937: Theater career===
Back in New York, Mann took a job as a night watchman for Westinghouse Electric, which enabled him to look for stage work during the day. Within a few months, Mann was working full-time at the Triangle Theater in Greenwich Village. Using the name &quot;Anton Bundsmann&quot;, he appeared as an actor in &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; (1925) with an English translation by Henry Alsberg, &quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Squall&quot; (1926) by Jean Bart. Towards the end of the decade, Mann appeared in the Broadway productions of &quot;The Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1929).

In 1930, Mann joined the Theatre Guild, as a production manager and eventually as a director. Nevertheless, he continued to act, appearing in &quot;The Streets of New York, or Poverty is No Crime&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Bride the Sun Shines On&quot; (1933) portraying the &quot;Duke of Calcavalle&quot;. In 1933, Mann directed a stage adaptation of Christopher Morley&#x27;s &quot;Thunder on the Left&quot;, which was performed at the Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre. In a theatre review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson dismissed the play, writing &quot;its medley of realism and fantasy grows less intelligible scene by scene, and some of the acting is disenchantingly profane.&quot; He later directed &quot;Cherokee Night&quot; (1936), &quot;So Proudly We Hail&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Big Blow&quot; (1938). He worked for various stock companies, and in 1934, he established his own, which later became Long Island&#x27;s Red Barn Playhouse.

===1937–1941: Move to Hollywood and television career===
In 1937, Mann began working for Selznick International Pictures as a talent scout and casting director. He also directed screen tests for a number of films, including &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938), &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939), &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), and &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940). One of the unknown actresses he tested was Jennifer Jones. After a few months at Selznick, Mann moved to Paramount Pictures to serve as an assistant director for several film directors, most particularly for Preston Sturges on &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941). Mann recalled, &quot;[Preston] let me go through the entire production, watching him direct – and I directed a little. I&#x27;d stage a scene and he&#x27;d tell me how lousy it was. Then I watched the editing and I was able gradually to build up knowledge. Preston insisted I make a film as soon as possible.&quot; He served three years in the position.

Meanwhile, Mann did notable, but mostly lost, work as a director for NBC&#x27;s experimental television station W2XBS from 1939 to 1940. This included condensations of the hit Western play &quot;The Missouri Legend&quot; and the melodrama &quot;The Streets of New York&quot;. A five-minute silent clip of the latter show survives in the Museum of Television and Radio, including noted actors Norman Lloyd and George Coulouris.

===1942–1946: Move to directing===
Through the efforts of his friend MacDonald Carey, Mann made his directorial debut with &quot;Dr. Broadway&quot; (1942) at Paramount, which starred Carey. Decades later, Mann remembered he was told to complete shooting the film in eighteen days. Upon its release, Herman Schoenfeld of &quot;Variety&quot; was dismissive of the film writing, &quot;The dialog could have just as well have been written in baby talk, and Anton Mann&#x27;s direction just wasn&#x27;t. The photography is spotty and the production looks inexpensive. Acting is weak, only Edward Ciannelli as the killer who gets killed, turning in an adequate job.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; was more complimentary, stating the film was a &quot;fairly good program entertainment&quot; with &quot;colorful characters, human interest, fast action, and situations that hold one in suspense.&quot;

His follow-up film was &quot;Moonlight in Havana&quot; (1943) at Universal Pictures. The film featured Allan Jones and Jane Frazee. In August 1944, it was reported Mann might return to Broadway to direct &quot;Mirror for Children&quot;. After nine months without directing a feature film, Mann went to Republic Pictures where he directed &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1944) and &quot;My Best Gal&quot; (1944).

He next directed &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; (1944). The film tells of Hilda Blake (Helene Thimig) who creates an imaginary &quot;daughter&quot; for Sgt. Johnny Meadows (William Terry) who is injured in the South Pacific. After being discharged and returning to the U.S., Meadows searches for the imaginary woman. He is informed of the truth by Dr. Leslie Ross (Virginia Grey), who is later murdered by Blake; in turn, Blake plans to murder Meadows. The film was notable for its noirish mise-en-scène and psychological depth that appeared in Mann&#x27;s latter films. Mann then directed &quot;The Great Flamarion&quot; (1945), starring Erich von Stroheim and Mary Beth Hughes. During principal photography, Mann clashed with von Stroheim, describing him at length as &quot;difficult. He was a personality, not really an actor ... He drove me mad. He was a genius. I&#x27;m not a genius: I&#x27;m a worker.&quot;

Mann moved to RKO to direct &quot;Two O&#x27;Clock Courage&quot; (1945), itself a remake of the 1936 film &quot;Two in the Dark&quot;, with Tom Conway and Ann Rutherford in the leading roles. That same year, he also directed &quot;Sing Your Way Home&quot;. Mann returned to Republic Pictures for &quot;Strange Impersonation&quot; (1946). He directed &quot;The Bamboo Blonde&quot; (1946) at RKO.

===1947–1949: Film noir and career breakthrough===
By 1946, Mann had signed with Eagle-Lion Films, a fledgling studio founded by Arthur B. Krim and Robert Benjamin. There, he directed &quot;Railroaded!&quot; (1947). According to Mann, the film was shot in ten days. A film review in &quot;Variety&quot; noted the film was &quot;an old-type, blood-and-thunder gangster meller that&#x27;s better than its no-name cast would indicate,&quot; and particular praised Mann for directing &quot;with real acumen in developing maximum of suspense.&quot; 

That same year, &quot;T-Men&quot; (1947) was released. According to Elmer Lincoln Irey, the film originated from a rejected offer to dramatize the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s investigation of Al Capone on tax evasion charges. Instead, Irey brought forward three cases related to the investigation. Initially budgeted at $400,000, &quot;T-Men&quot; was shot within three weeks from July 31 to August 23, with four days of reshoots in September. For the film, Mann specifically requested cinematographer John Alton, who was loaned out from Republic for the job, marking &quot;T-Men&quot; as their first collaboration. During its release, the film earned $2.5 million worldwide.

He went back to RKO for &quot;Desperate&quot; (1947), which he also co-wrote with Dorothy Atlas. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; positively wrote it was &quot;a ripsnorting gangster meller, with enough gunplay, bumping off of characters and grim brutality to smack of pre-code days&quot;; Mann&#x27;s direction was noted as &quot;being done skillfully&quot;. 

Mann returned to Eagle-Lion to direct &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1948), reteaming with screenwriter John C. Higgins, screenwriter Leopold Atlas and actor Dennis O&#x27;Keefe. The film centers on Joe (O&#x27;Keefe), who has been wrongly imprisoned and fingered by his old friends. He escapes from prison and goes on the run with two women, a nice social worker, Ann (Marsha Hunt), whom he takes as a hostage, and a femme fatale, Pat (Claire Trevor), who helped release him. Both women are doomed to be in love with him. The film review magazine &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Fast-paced and packed with action, this gangster-type melodrama should go over pretty well with adult audiences, in spite of the fact that the plot is not always logical&quot;; it also noted &quot;Anthony Mann&#x27;s taut direction has squeezed every bit of excitement and suspense out of the material at hand.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;Though a medium budgeter, [&quot;Raw Deal&quot;] is dressed tidily with a good production and some marquee weight furnished by&quot; the cast. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing it is &quot;a movie—and a pretty low-grade one, at that—in which sensations of fright and excitement are more diligently pursued than common sense.&quot;

Mann&#x27;s success with &quot;Desperate&quot; and &quot;T-Men&quot; made him Eagle-Lion&#x27;s most valuable director. In February 1948, Mann was hired to direct a dramatization of the storming of the Bastille, with Richard Basehart to portray an aide to General Lafayette. With Walter Wanger preoccupied with &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), he handed off supervisory duties to production designer William Cameron Menzies. Principal photography lasted 29 days, from August to September 1948, and cost $850,000. Reteaming with Alton, he and Mann developed a low-cost noir style, using low lighting levels and omnipresent shadows on minimal decor, high-angled camera shots, and rear projection for wide crowd shots. The resulting film was titled &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; (1949). After filming had begun, Mann was brought in to direct several scenes for &quot;He Walked by Night&quot; (1948), which also starred Basehart. Mann again collaborated with Higgins and Alton on the film. However, Alfred L. Werker was given the official director&#x27;s credit.

While researching on &quot;T-Men&quot; (1947), Higgins and Mann had come across the topic of Border Patrol agents along the Mexico–United States border. &quot;Border Incident&quot; (1949) was initially developed at Eagle-Lion, but in December 1948, MGM&#x27;s Dore Schary purchased the script for $50,000 and hired Mann to direct the film. Schary had also signed Mann onto a multi-picture contract with MGM. 

Beforehand, in July 1947, Mann and Francis Rosenwald had written a script for &quot;Follow Me Quietly&quot; (1949). It was first purchased by Jack Wrather Productions for Allied Artists, with Don Castle in the lead role. According to Eddie Muller, of Turner Classic Movies, Mann was slated to direct the film, but was enticed by Edward Small to instead direct &quot;T-Men&quot; and &quot;Raw Deal&quot;. Months later, in December, RKO had purchased the script from Wrather and assigned Martin Rackin write a new script. Due to Mann&#x27;s absence, Richard Fleischer was hired to direct &quot;Follow Me Quietly&quot;, and there has been speculation suggesting Mann did uncredited filming. However, Muller has disagreed.

Mann and Rosenwald wrote another script titled &quot;Stakeout&quot;, which told of a police detective attempting to expose a corrupt political machine. In October 1949, independent film producer Louis Mandel purchased the script, with Larry Parks cast in the lead role. Joseph H. Lewis was set to direct the film until he left due to a contractual dispute. By March 1950, Parks&#x27;s wife Betty Garrett was cast in the &quot;femme fatale&quot; role, but the project never went into production.

===1950–1958: Western films and collaborations with James Stewart===
The 1950s marked a notable turn in Mann&#x27;s career, in which he directed a total of ten Western films throughout the decade (three of which were released in 1950). After &quot;Border Incident&quot; (1949), Mann was approached by Nicholas Nayfack, who asked him: &quot;How would you like to direct a Western? I&#x27;ve a scenario here that seems interesting.&quot; He was handed the script for &quot;Devil&#x27;s Doorway&quot; (1950), deeming it &quot;the best script I had ever read.&quot; The film starred Robert Taylor, portraying a Shoshone native who faces prejudice after returning home in Medicine Bow, Wyoming following his decorated service in the American Civil War. Principal photography began on August 15, 1949, and lasted until mid-October. MGM initially withheld the film because of its topical subject, but released the film after Delmer Daves&#x27; &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950), which starred James Stewart, had become successful. When it was released, the film was neither a critical or commercial success.

He followed this with a Western at Universal, starring James Stewart, &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950). The film was originally set to be directed by Fritz Lang, but he felt Stewart was unsuitable for the lead role and dropped out. When Stewart had seen a rough cut of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Doorway&quot; (1950), he suggested Mann as a replacement. Mann readily accepted, but threw out the script calling Borden Chase for a rewrite. Principal photography began on February 14, 1950, in Tucson, Arizona for a thirty-day shooting schedule. The film was a commercial success, earning $2.25 million in distributor rentals becoming Universal Pictures&#x27; second-most successful film of 1950.

At the invitation of Hal Wallis, Mann directed the Western &quot;The Furies&quot; (1950) at Paramount starring Barbara Stanwyck and Walter Huston. Also released in summer 1950, the film grossed $1.55 million in distributor rentals in the United States and Canada. Mann reflected, &quot;It had marvellous characters, interesting notices, but it failed because nobody in it cared about anything—they were all rudderless, rootless, and haters.&quot; In the fall of 1950, Mann was sent to Cinecittà to do second-unit work on &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951). There, Mann worked 24 nights, filming the burning of Rome sequence with assistant cinematographer William V. Skall.

&quot;Side Street&quot; (1950) was the final &quot;film noir&quot; that Mann directed. The film starred Farley Granger and Cathy O&#x27;Donnell, reteaming after &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1948). He next directed a period thriller with Dick Powell, &quot;The Tall Target&quot; (1952).

After the success of &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), Universal Pictures wanted another collaboration between Mann and Stewart. After a recommendation from one friend, Stewart proposed adapting the novel &quot;Bend of the River&quot; by Bill Gulick to Universal. The studio agreed and purchased the film rights. The actor and director made a contemporary adventure film, &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; (1953) at Universal. Feeling dissatisfied with the final film, Mann stated, &quot;We tried but it was all too fabricated and the story was weak. We were never able to lick it ...It didn&#x27;t get terribly good notices but of course it made a profit.&quot; 
In 1952, MGM approached Mann to direct &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953). The story told of bounty hunter Howard Kemp who wants to collect a $5,000 reward on an outlaw&#x27;s head so he can buy back land lost to him during the American Civil War. With unwanted help from a gold prospector and an Army deserter, Kemp captures the outlaw and the girlfriend who accompanies him. With the film&#x27;s release in 1953, Mann fulfilled his contract with MGM.

Mann and Stewart had their biggest success with &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954). During its release, the film earned $7 million in distributor rentals in the United States and Canada. That same year, he filmed &quot;The Far Country&quot; with James Stewart and Walter Brennan. The film would be Mann&#x27;s last collaboration with Borden Chase.

Mann and Stewart paired for one more non-Western film, &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (1955). Stewart had served with the U.S. Air Force and pushed for a cinematic portrayal. With the cooperation of the Air Force, Mann agreed to direct the film, wanting to film the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 in action as the human characters, in his words, &quot;were papier-mâché&quot;. During its release, the film earned $6.5 million at the box office. 

Mann&#x27;s last collaboration with Stewart was &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot; (1955) at Columbia Pictures. The film was an adaptation from a serial by Thomas T. Flynn, first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1954. The film was shot on location in Coronado, New Mexico, and in Sante Fe. The film was the favorite of Stewart&#x27;s of the films they made together. After the film&#x27;s release, Harry Cohn asked Mann to direct another Western film for Columbia. Mann agreed and decided to direct &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1955). Mann offered Stewart the lead role to which he declined and instead cast Victor Mature.

In 1956, Mann was handed the script for &quot;Night Passage&quot; (1957) by Aaron Rosenberg, intending to reunite him with Stewart for a potential ninth collaboration. Before filming was set to begin on September 4, Mann withdrew from the project. Contemporary accounts reported that Mann withdrew because he had not yet finished editing &quot;Men in War&quot; (1957). However, latter accounts state Mann had developed creative differences with Chase over the script, which Mann considered to be weak. In 1967, Mann had also accused Stewart of only doing the film so he can play his accordion. Mann asked to be replaced, and James Neilson was hired to direct the film. Stewart and Mann never collaborated on another project again.

Mann directed a musical starring Mario Lanza titled &quot;Serenade&quot; (1956). During filming, he worked with actress Sara Montiel, who became his second wife. In August 1957, Mann announced he had acquired the film rights to Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s novel &quot;This is the Hour&quot;, which told a fictionalized account of painter Francisco Goya. Montiel was set to portray Maria Teresa de Cayetana, Duchess of Alba. By February 1958, Mann had abandoned the project as a rival film titled &quot;The Naked Maja&quot; (1958) was in production. He then purchased the film rights to John McPartland&#x27;s then-recently published novel &quot;Ripe Fruit&quot;, with Montiel set to star. However, the project failed to materialize.

Mann directed a Western starring Henry Fonda and Anthony Perkins titled &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957). Mann then teamed with Philip Yordan on two films starring Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray; the first being &quot;Men in War&quot; (1957) was about the Korean War. The film was the first of three Mann had directed for United Artists. His second project was a 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell&#x27;s then-controversial novel &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;. Mann and producer Sidney Harmon had intended to film in Augusta, Georgia, but the novel&#x27;s controversial subject matter heightened resistance from city leaders and local farmers. As a result, the production was denied permission to film in the state. In October 1957, they eventually selected Stockton, California. On both films, Yordan was given the official screenwriter credit, but Ben Maddow stated he had written both screenplays.

Mann later directed Gary Cooper in a Western, &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958) for United Artists. Filming began on February 10, 1958, and ended later that same year. When it was released, Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film was &quot;good, lean, tough little Western&quot; that was &quot;[w]ell-acted and beautifully photographed in color and Cinema-Scope&quot;. Elsewhere, Jean-Luc Godard, then a critic for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, gave the film a raving review when it was released in France.

===1959–1964: Widescreen films===
Mann was hired by Universal Pictures to direct &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), much to the disagreement of Kirk Douglas who felt Mann &quot;seemed scared of the scope of the picture&quot;. Filming started on January 27, 1959, in Death Valley, California for the mine sequence. As filming continued, Douglas felt Mann had lost control of the film, writing in particular: &quot;He let Peter Ustinov direct his own scenes by taking every suggestion Peter made. The suggestions were good—for Peter, but not necessarily for the film.&quot; With the studio&#x27;s approval, Douglas was permitted to fire Mann. According to Douglas&#x27;s account, Mann graciously exited the production on February 13, to which Douglas promised he &quot;owe[d]&quot; a film to him. In 1967, Mann stated: &quot;Kirk Douglas was the producer of &quot;Spartacus&quot;: he wanted to insist on the message angle. I thought the message would go over more easily by showing physically all the horrors of slavery. A film must be visual, too much dialogue kills it ... From then, we disagreed: I left.&quot; On February 17, 1959, Stanley Kubrick was hired to direct. 

Shortly after, Mann went to MGM to direct Glenn Ford in a remake of &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960). During production, Mann had filmed on location for twelve days, but the shoot had experienced troublesome storms. In response, studio executives at MGM decided to relocate the production indoors. Mann disagreed, remarking the production had become &quot;an economic disaster and a fiasco and the whole project was destroyed.&quot; Mann left the production, and was replaced by Charles Walters.

In July 1960, Mann was hired to direct &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961) for Samuel Bronston. The film starred Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren. In November 1960, before filming was to begin, Loren was displeased with her dialogue in the script, and requested for blacklisted screenwriter Ben Barzman to rewrite it. On an airplane trip to Rome, Mann retrieved Barzman and handed him the latest shooting script, to which Barzman agreed to rewrite from scratch. Filming began on November 14, 1960, and lasted until April 1961. Released in December 1961, &quot;El Cid&quot; was released to critical acclaim, with praise towards Mann&#x27;s direction, the cast and the cinematography. At the box office, the film earned $12 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada.

Mann next directed &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964). The project&#x27;s genesis began when Mann, who had recently finished filming &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), had spotted an Oxford concise edition of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s six-volume series &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; near the front window at the Hatchards bookshop. Mann then read the book, and after a flight trip to Madrid, he pitched a film adaptation of the book to Bronston, to which the producer agreed. The film was intended to reunite Heston and Loren, but Heston departed the project to star in &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963), another Bronston production. His role was subsequently assumed by Stephen Boyd. Filming began on January 14, 1963, and wrapped in July 1963. Released in March 1964, the film earned $1.9 million in box office rentals in the United States and Canada, against an estimated production budget of $16 million. That same year, in July, Mann served as the head of the jury at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival.

===1965–1967: Later films===
In March 1963, Mann and producer S. Benjamin Fisz had reportedly begun development on &quot;The Unknown Battle&quot;, a historic re-telling of Norwegian resistance soldier Knut Haukelid&#x27;s sabotage mission to prevent Nazi Germany from developing an atomic bomb during World War II. Barzman had been hired to write the script, with Allied Artists as a distributor. By February 1964, Boyd and Elke Sommer had been hired to portray the leading roles. However, in July, Kirk Douglas was hired to portray the lead role. In his memoir, Douglas accepted the role after receiving an unexpected phone call from Mann, fulfilling his earlier promise that he &quot;owed&quot; him a film. The film was then re-titled &quot;The Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965).

In October 1966, Mann was announced to direct and produce the spy thriller &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968) for Columbia Pictures. By December, filming was set to begin in February 1967 where it would film on location in Austria, Germany, and London. At the time of his death, Mann was developing three projects: a Western film titled &quot;The King&quot;, which was loosely adapted from &quot;King Lear&quot;, with sons replacing the daughters; &quot;The Donner Pass&quot;, a film about pioneers trekking to the Donner Pass; and &quot;The Canyon&quot;, a film about a young Native American becoming a Brave.

==Personal life and death==
In 1936, Mann married Mildred Kenyon, who worked as a clerk at a Macy&#x27;s department store in New York City. The marriage produced two children, Anthony and Nina. The couple divorced in 1956. A year later, Mann married actress Sara Montiel, who had starred in &quot;Serenade&quot; (1956). In 1963, the marriage was annulled in Madrid. His third marriage was to Anna Kuzko, a ballerina formerly with Sadler&#x27;s Wells, who had one son named Nicholas.

On April 29, 1967, Mann died from a heart attack in his hotel room in Berlin. He had spent the two weeks prior to his death filming &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot;. The film was completed by the film&#x27;s star Laurence Harvey. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6229 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Filmmaking style==
===Portrayal of antiheroes===
Mann&#x27;s filmography has been observed for his depiction of antiheroes. In 2006, Richard Corliss observed that Mann&#x27;s antiheroes typically have a troubled past, leaving them jaded or cynical at the start of the film, and are presented with a path to redemption. Jean-Pierre Coursodon and Pierre Sauvage noted the troubled past in Mann&#x27;s several films have included &quot;the death of a loved one (a father in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; and &quot;The Furies&quot;, a brother in &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot;, a wife in &quot;The Tin Star&quot;), and the hero is out to punish the responsible party or, as in the case of &quot;The Tin Star&quot;, resents society as a whole for what happened.&quot;

By the 1950s, Mann had shifted to directing Western films, with &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950) as his first collaboration with James Stewart. Aaron Rosenberg, who had produced the film, observed: &quot;He [Mann] also brought out something in James Stewart that hadn&#x27;t been really been seen before. It was an almost manic rage that would suddenly explode ... And then Stewart&#x27;s character would just go into a violent rage which was a fresh approach, not just for Stewart but also for the Western. Here was a hero with flaws.&quot; In &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953), Howard Kemp (Stewart) is a bounty hunter intent on bringing a fugitive back to Kansas. When faced with the choice to kill the fugitive, Kemp reins in his murderous impulse. Corliss observed: &quot;It happens over and over in these movies: the hero&#x27;s recognition that his old self is his own worst enemy.&quot;

Mann and Stewart had a falling out during pre-production of &quot;Night Passage&quot; (1957), in which Gary Cooper assumed the lead role in &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958). Mann biographer Jeanine Basinger writes Cooper&#x27;s character is a &quot;man with a guilty secret. He was once an evil outlaw, a member of the notorious Dock Tobin gang. He was responsible for robberies, raids, and the murders of innocent victims.&quot; In the film, Link Jones (Cooper) is confronted by his outlaw uncle Dock Tobin (Lee J. Cobb), a figure of his past. In the narrative, Link realizes he must kill all the gang members not only to save himself but also to restore the world which he has made for himself. 

===Use of landscapes===
Mann&#x27;s portrayal of the American landscape in his Westerns have been observed by film academics. In a 1965 interview, Mann expressed his preference for location filming, stating: &quot;Well, the use of the location is to enhance the characters who are involved in it, because somebody who is really minor in feelings and minor as an actor can become tremendous once he&#x27;s set against a tremendously pictorial background. The great value of using locations is that it enhances everything: it enhances the story; it enhances the very action and the acting. I&#x27;ll never show a piece of scenery, a gorge, a chasm, without an actor in it.&quot;

Coursodon and Sauvage noted Mann incorporates landscapes as part of the narrative, writing &quot;His camera is never too close to isolate, never too far to dwarf. He is not interested in &quot;beauty&quot; per se, neither does he care much for symbolism. He had an unfailing flair for selecting exteriors that were not only adapted to the requirements of the script but came across as the embodiment of the psychological and moral tensions in it.&quot; During filming for &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960), Mann&#x27;s preference for location shooting ran into conflict with MGM producer Sol Lesser, who relocated the production indoors, which forced Mann&#x27;s departure from the film.

<doc id="990714" wikidata="Q4872903" url="?curid=990714" title="Battle of the Dardanelles (1655)">
<text>This battle took place on 21 June 1655 inside the mouth of the Dardanelles Strait. It was a clear victory for Venice over the Ottoman Empire during the Cretan War.

The Venetians, under Lazzaro Mocenigo, continued their strategy of blockading the Dardanelles, to prevent the Ottomans from resupplying their forces in the Aegean Sea. The orders were the same as for the previous year - remain at anchor until the Ottoman fleet passed, then attack the rear - and this time the plan worked. The previous Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral), Murat Pasha, had been promoted to Grand Vizier and his replacement, Mustafa Pasha, had 36 sailing ships, 8 galleasses and 60 galleys, as well as perhaps several galleys from outside the Dardanelles. Once again, the Ottomans were arranged in 3 lines abreast: Sailing ships, then galleasses, then galleys. The Venetians had 26 sailing ships, 4 galleasses and 6 galleys.

As the Ottomans advanced, one galleass was sunk and one galley burnt and the rowing vessels retreated, after which the Venetians attacked the Ottoman sailing ships, resulting in 9 being burnt and 2 wrecked. The only Venetian loss was &quot;David Golia&quot;, which was burnt. Venetian casualties exclusive of the sunken ship were 126 killed and 180 wounded. 358 Ottomans were taken prisoner.

<text>Born Yesterday is an album by the Everly Brothers, released in 1986. It peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 22 on the Top Country Albums charts. The title track, written by Don, was the first single; &quot;I Know Love&quot; was the second.

==Production==
The album was produced by Dave Edmunds. &quot;Why Worry&quot; is a cover of the Dire Straits song. &quot;Amanda Ruth&quot; is a cover of the Rank and File song, which had been inspired by the brothers&#x27; version of &quot;Lucille&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; wrote that the album &quot;has no irresistible tunes but plenty of good, well-crafted numbers.&quot; &quot;The Gazette&quot; noted that the &quot;adult-oriented pop and country record has an almost limpid quality to it; partially due to the brother&#x27;s effortless harmonies; partly because of Edmond&#x27;s hands-off production; and partly thanks to the astounding virtuosity of veteran players.&quot;

<doc id="990726" wikidata="Q19512" url="?curid=990726" title="FC Sochaux-Montbéliard">
<text>Football Club Sochaux-Montbéliard (; commonly referred to as FCSM or simply Sochaux) is a French association football club based in the city of Montbéliard. The club was founded in 1928 and currently plays in Championnat National, the third tier of French football, after having been administratively relegated from Ligue 2 in the 2022–23 season, despite a 9th place finish. Sochaux plays its home matches at the Stade Auguste Bonal, located within the city.

Sochaux was founded by Jean-Pierre Peugeot, a prominent member of the Peugeot family, and is one of the founding members of the first division of French football. The club has won both Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France twice and have also won the Coupe de la Ligue. Sochaux&#x27;s last honour came in 2007 when the club, under the guidance of Alain Perrin, defeated favourites Marseille 5–4 on penalties in the 2007 Coupe de France Final. Sochaux&#x27;s colours are gold and navy blue.

Sochaux is known for its youth academy, which has regularly finished in the top ten rankings of youth academies in France (fourth in 2010). The most successful team in the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the Coupe Gambardella twice, in 1973 and 2007. In 2010, Sochaux finished runners-up to Metz in the 2010 edition of the competition. The academy has produced several notable talents, such as Yannick Stopyra, El-Hadji Diouf, Jérémy Ménez, Bernard Genghini and Benoît Pedretti, among others. The club were a regular in the top flight, until relegation in 2014.

==History==
Football Club Sochaux-Montbéliard was founded in 1928 under the name &quot;Football Club Sochaux&quot; by Jean-Pierre Peugeot, a director of Peugeot, a French car manufacturing company. Peugeot sought to create a football club for the leisure time of the company&#x27;s workers. He installed Louis Maillard-Salin as the club&#x27;s first president, and made Maurice Bailly the club&#x27;s first manager. Bailly was also a member of the team. Sochaux played its first match on 2 September 1928 against the reserve team of local club &quot;AS Montbéliard&quot;. The club was inserted into the lowest level of league football in the Franche-Comté region and played its first league match three weeks later winning 12–1.
Peugeot was among the first to advocate for the professionalisation of French football and, in 1929, went as far as to admit to paying his players, which was strictly forbidden during this time. The subsequent recruitment of several French internationals and players from abroad led to Sochaux gaining a stranglehold on the region easily disposing of local rivals &quot;AS Montbéliard&quot; and AS Valentigney. In June 1930, Montbéliard decided to merge with Sochaux to form the club that exists today. The following month, the National Council of the French Football Federation voted 128–20 in support of professionalism in French football. With Peugeot being a strong advocate for professionalism, Sochaux were among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional. In the league&#x27;s inaugural season, Sochaux finished 3rd in its group. The club&#x27;s final position was later moved to 2nd after Antibes, the champions of the group, was disqualified from the league for suspected bribery.

In the 1934–35 season, Sochaux captured its first league title finishing one point ahead of Strasbourg. Led by Uruguayan manager Conrad Ross, as well as captain Étienne Mattler, known as &quot;Le Lion de Belfort&quot;, and strikers Roger Courtois and Bernard Williams, Sochaux dominated the league losing only four times. Two seasons later, the same team, with the addition of goalkeeper Laurent Di Lorto and the Swiss duo of André Abegglen and Maxime Lehmann, Sochaux won its first Coupe de France title. The club faced league rivals Strasbourg in the final and defeated the Alsatians 2–1 courtesy of goals from Williams and the Argentine Miguel Angel Lauri. Ross finished his career at Sochaux by winning another league title in 1938. After the 1938–39 season, Ross and several players departed the club to play and manage abroad due to the onset of World War II. The non-deserters were, subsequently, called into action to fight with the French Army, which ultimately caused the club to limit its aspiring ambitions.

During war-time, in an effort to survive financially, Sochaux formed an interim merger with local rivals AS Valentigney. The club, known as &quot;FC Sochaux-Valentigney&quot;, participated in the war-time championships from 1942 to 1944. Following the conclusion of the war, Sochaux dissolved the merger, turn professional again, and returned to its original name. The club, however, failed to get back to its form prior to the war and, subsequently, made the decision to forgo entering bidding wars for players, which was becoming the norm and, instead, focus on keeping the team&#x27;s budget even. As a result, in the first season after the war, Sochaux suffered relegation after finishing in last place with only 15 points. Sochaux spent only one season in the second division and returned to Division 1 for the 1947–48 season. The club spent the next 13 seasons playing in Division 1 with its best finish coming during the 1952–53 season when the club finished runner-up to champions Stade Reims. In the same season, Sochaux won its first honour since 1938 after winning the Coupe Charles Drago. In 1959, the club returned to the Coupe de France final, however, the outcome was not in Sochaux&#x27;s favour, with the club losing 3–0 to Le Havre in a replay after a 2–2 draw.

In the early 1960s, despite playing in Division 2, Sochaux won the Coupe Drago in back-to-back seasons. The club made its return to Division 1 in 1964, and remained in the league for over 20 years, regularly finishing in the top ten before falling down to Division 2 in the 1987–88 season. During Sochaux&#x27;s 24-year run in the first division, the club played in European competitions four times. In the 1980–81 season, Sochaux surprised many by reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. In the round, the club was defeated by Dutch club AZ 4–3 on aggregate. The club&#x27;s successful play during this stint was predominantly due to the creation of the club&#x27;s academy in 1974, which paid immediate dividends. Player such as Bernard Genghini, Yannick Stopyra, Joël Bats and Philippe Anziani were among the inaugural graduates who were instrumental in Sochaux&#x27;s domestic success.
After hovering between the first division and the second division in the 1990s, Sochaux returned to the first division, now called Ligue 1, at the start of the new millennium. The club surprised many by finishing in the top ten in its first three seasons back. Also included in that three-year run was an appearance in the Coupe de la Ligue final and, in the ensuing year, a league cup title. In the 2003 final, Sochaux, led by manager Guy Lacombe and academy graduates Pierre-Alain Frau, Jérémy Mathieu, and Benoît Pedretti, were defeated 4–1 by Monaco. In the following season, a more experienced Sochaux returned to the final, where the club faced Nantes. Sochaux defeated Nantes 5–4 on penalties to win its first major title since winning the Coupe Drago 40 years previously. It did not take the club another 40 years to claim its next title as Sochaux were surprise winners of the Coupe de France in the 2006–07 season after defeating Marseille on penalties. Marseille were heavy favourites heading into match, mainly due to its 4–2 thrashing of Sochaux just 12 days before. However, Sochaux, led by Alain Perrin, stunned the nation and claimed its first Coupe de France title since 1937.

In July 2015, Peugeot sold the team to Hong Kong company Ledus. In 2018 it was announced that Spanish club Alavés (whose owners had a stake in Ledus) was starting a partnership with Sochaux; however the agreement lasted only a few months, ending abruptly in December of the same year.

With Omar Daf as coach, FCSM win the last game of season against Grenoble Foot 38 and save his Ligue 2 place. Club finish 16th in Ligue 2 but is demoted to National by the DNCG (National Directorate of Management Control), for not having presented balanced accounts.

Chinese real estate group Nenking, who unofficially take the reins of the club, following the economic problems encountered by Tech Pro, inject money into the coffers to save him from relegation. Nenking also appoint Samuel Laurent to the position of general director.

In April 2020, the Football Club Sochaux-Montbéliard SASP (Société Anonyme Sportive Professionnelle) officially became the property of the Nenking Group. &quot;This sale to the group whose founding president is Mr. Zhong Naixiong comes in accordance with the agreements previously made with Ledus&quot; and Frankie Yau become president.

On 28 June 2023, the DNCG confirmed the administrative relegation of Sochaux to Championnat National due to their financial crisis.

==Stadium==

Sochaux plays its home matches at the Stade Auguste Bonal in Montbéliard. The stadium was constructed in 1931 and opened on 11 November of that same year. The facility was previously known as &quot;Stade de la Forge&quot;. In July 1945, the club changed the stadium&#x27;s name to its current version. It is named after Auguste Bonal, the former sports director of the club, who after refusing to co-operate with the Germans during World War II, was murdered.

The Stade Auguste Bonal has undergone renovations twice: in 1973 and 1997. In 1997, the majority of the stadium was completely overhauled, and practically a new stadium was built. The stadium still hosted matches during the renovation period, but with a limited capacity. The renovation cost ₣114 million, and took nearly three years to complete. The &quot;Nouveau Bonal&quot; was officially inaugurated on 22 July 2000 in a Trophée des champions match between FC Nantes and AS Monaco. The stadium&#x27;s current capacity is 20,005.

<text>Donald Zackary Greinke ( ; born October 21, 1983) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 20 seasons. Greinke primarily played with the Kansas City Royals across two stints; from his 2004 debut to 2010, and from 2022 to 2023. He has also played for the Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Houston Astros, with the last of which Greinke finished as a runner-up in the 2019 and 2021 World Series. Greinke is considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of his generation.

The Royals selected Greinke in the first round with the sixth pick of the 2002 MLB draft, after he won the Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career was nearly derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005 and 2006, and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief pitcher, before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game, led the major leagues in earned run average, and won the American League Cy Young Award.

Following his first stint with the Royals, Greinke would bounce around the league as a journeyman, playing for the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, and Astros across small stints from 2011 to 2021. During this time, Greinke was known for his streak of six consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 2014 to 2019, as well as his second league-leading earned run average in 2015 with the Dodgers.

A dedicated competitor often described as unique in his talent and demeanor by teammates, Greinke is a six-time All-Star, six-time Gold Glove Award winner, two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, two-time earned run average leader, and an American League Cy Young Award recipient.

With 2,979 career strikeouts, Greinke was 21 strikeouts short of being the 20th member of the 3,000 strikeout club. Greinke was also one of only five pitchers (Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, and Roger Clemens) to strike out 1,000 different batters, with his 1,000th strikeout coming against Joey Wiemer on May 14, 2023.

==Early life==
Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He is of German descent, and was active in Little League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth. As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team, and his coach estimated that he hit close to .700 in the tournament.

Greinke was primarily a shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career. He worked as a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting pitcher as a senior. During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled a 9–2 win–loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average. He led his team to a 32–2 record and their third straight district title, and was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year. After the high school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against some of the best hitters in the country.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Kansas City Royals selected Greinke in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. They felt Greinke was a polished player who could move quickly through their system. Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.

Greinke pitched in six minor league games (five starts) for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 ERA in innings.

In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, where he was 11–1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts. Those numbers earned spots on both the Carolina League mid-season and post-season all-star teams as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award. The Blue Rocks&#x27; manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was &quot;the best pitcher I&#x27;ve ever seen at this level of the minor leagues.&quot;
He was promoted in July to the Double-A Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League, where in nine starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA. He had a couple of games where he struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season.

Greinke was named the organization&#x27;s Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2003. He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Triple-A Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1–1 with a 2.51 ERA in six starts.

===Kansas City Royals (2004–2010)===

Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing two earned runs in five innings. At 20 years old, he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team&#x27;s closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.

Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos. In 24 starts, Greinke finished the 2004 season with an 8–11 record and a 3.97 ERA.

On June 10, 2005, Greinke recorded his first major league hit; a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12–11 loss. However, he also allowed 15 hits and 11 runs in that game. The 15 hits allowed tied a franchise record, while the 11 runs set a club record. In 2005, Greinke led the American League in losses, finishing with a 5–17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts.

Greinke was sometimes quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett. Still, by the 2005–2006 off-season he nearly quit baseball; Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did not expect to return. He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006. It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder. He reported back to the Royals&#x27; spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely. He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication. Greinke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1–0 with a 4.26 ERA.

In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, but was assigned to the bullpen in early May. In 52 appearances (14 starts), Greinke finished 2007 with a 7–7 record, one save, and a 3.69 ERA.

Greinke returned to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13–10 record along with 183 strikeouts. His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years. On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million.

After ending the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run. Greinke was named American League (AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors. On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza&#x27;s team record for strikeouts in a single game. On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.

Greinke&#x27;s record for the 2009 season was 16–8, and he posted an ERA of 2.16, the lowest in MLB. On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher of the Year by &quot;Sporting News&quot;. On October 28, Greinke was awarded the MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won the AL Cy Young Award. Greinke credited some of his performance to his use of &quot;modern pitching metrics&quot; — statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching. Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. &quot;That&#x27;s pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible.

Despite a stellar 2009 season, his performance in 2010 began to regress as he finished the year 10–14 with a 4.17 ERA and 181 strikeouts.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2011–2012)===
On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team. The Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects. On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks. Greinke would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, saying that he was &quot;pretty rude&quot; on the way out, but the deal worked out well for both teams.

In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball. He started the 2011 season on the disabled list.
Greinke made his Brewers debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011. Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record in 28 starts. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (seventh in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering just 45 walks. Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins. He went a perfect 11–0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers&#x27; home stadium.

On April 7, 2012, the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6–0 in Greinke&#x27;s first start of the season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits and striking out seven.

In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just four pitches for angrily throwing the ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers&#x27; starter on July 13, the team&#x27;s next game. Greinke&#x27;s third start ended after five innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day.

To begin 2012, Greinke made 21 starts with the Brewers and had a 9–3 record, 120 strikeouts, and a 3.44 ERA.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2012)===
Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27, 2012, in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was fond of Greinke.

Greinke made his first start for the Angels on July 29. After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in innings.

Greinke became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game. He finished his time with the Angels with a 6–2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts. Overall in 2012, combined with both teams, Greinke made 34 starts with a 15–5 record, 200 strikeouts, and a 3.48 ERA.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2015)===
Greinke agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández&#x27;s seven-year, $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later explained that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.

On April 11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch and charged the mound. He was placed on the disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery, which was performed on April 13. It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. He returned to the Dodgers on May 15, tossing innings of one-run ball and striking out four to earn the win.

On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the brawl, he was unaffected.
Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. Louis Cardinals. He was 5–0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month. Greinke finished his first season with the Dodgers with a 15–4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season. He was awarded with the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League.

Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned runs. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and finished the season with a 17–8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career. He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National League.

When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered until the All-Star break. Greinke was then selected to the All-Star Game, his second straight appearance, and chosen to be the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7–2 record. After Greinke retired 28 consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19.

Greinke&#x27;s recorded a scoreless innings streak which reached 45 innings; it started on June 18 and ended on July 26 start against the New York Mets at Citi Field and is the sixth-longest streak in MLB history. He shared the NL Player of the Week honors with his teammate Clayton Kershaw for July 13–19. Greinke finished the 2015 season with a 19–3 record, 200 strikeouts, and a major-league-best 1.66 ERA. His ERA was the second lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, and his ERA+ (225) and major-league-leading WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history. He led all major league pitchers in left on base percentage, stranding 86.5% of base runners.

Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in innings and took the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series. At the conclusion of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent. He officially opted out on November 3.

After the season, Greinke was selected as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards, and won his second Gold Glove Award. Greinke finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2016–2019)===
On December 8, 2015, Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks lost the game 10–5. In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks lost the game 4–2. Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 19, 2016, against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over six innings of work. On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain. On August 24, 2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks&#x27; 10–9 win over Atlanta Braves. Greinke made 26 starts in his first season with Arizona, and he had a 13–7 record and a 4.37 ERA in innings. He won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award after the season.

In 2017, Greinke was selected to the NL All-Star team, his fourth All-Star selection. At the time of his selection he was 10–4 with a 3.05 ERA in innings, 128 strikeouts (10.21 strikeouts per nine innings), WHIP of 1.02 and a .219 opponents batting average. On September 16 versus the San Francisco Giants at AT&amp;T Park, he completed eight shutout innings with two hits allowed and eight strikeouts as Arizona won, 2−0. His game score of 90 was the second-best of his career, and he also hit two doubles at the plate. In 32 starts in 2017, Greinke finished with a 17–7 record, 215 strikeouts, and a 3.20 ERA in innings. The Diamondbacks finished with a 93–69 record and clinched a Wild Card spot, but lost to the Dodgers in the Division Series. Greinke won his fourth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award after the 2017 season. He also finished fourth in the Cy Young voting behind Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg.

Greinke was once again named an All-Star in 2018. He finished the season with a 15–11 record and a 3.21 ERA in 33 starts. Following the season, he won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award.

On April 2, 2019, Greinke hit two home runs and struck out 10 as the Diamondbacks won 8–5 against the Padres. In 2019 with Arizona before he was traded, he was 10–4 with a 2.90 ERA.

Greinke batted .271 with three home runs and 8 RBI with the Diamondbacks in 2019, earning him his second career Silver Slugger Award.

===Houston Astros (2019–2021)===
On July 31, 2019, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke to the Houston Astros with cash considerations for four minor league prospects: Corbin Martin, J. B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, and Joshua Rojas. The Diamondbacks also agreed to pay $24 million of Greinke&#x27;s remaining $77 million salary.

On September 14, 2019, against the Kansas City Royals, Greinke became the 19th pitcher in MLB history to win a game against all 30 MLB franchises. In 2019 with the Astros, he was 8–1 with a 3.02 ERA. Between the two teams, in 2019 he was 18–5 with a 2.93 ERA, as in 208.2 innings (sixth in the majors) over 33 starts he walked only 30 batters (1.3 walks per nine innings, the best ratio of his career and third-best in the major leagues), and had a WHIP of 0.982 (fifth-best in the major leagues). At the plate, he batted .280/.308/.580 with three home runs and 8 RBI in 50 at bats. Greinke started Games 3 and 7 of the 2019 World Series for Houston. Greinke allowed two runs on two hits in innings in his Game 7 start. He was pulled by manager A. J. Hinch in the seventh inning after surrendering a one-out home run to Anthony Rendon, followed by a walk to Juan Soto, with the Astros leading 2–1. He was replaced by Will Harris, who allowed a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick. The Astros lost the game 6–2, prompting questions by members of the media about Hinch&#x27;s decision to pull Greinke.

In 2020, Greinke produced a 3–3 record with a 4.03 ERA in 12 starts spanning 67 innings, and was second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.209) and fourth in home runs per nine innings (0.806).

On April 1, 2021, Greinke earned his first Opening Day win and 209th win overall as the Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 8–1, at the Oakland Coliseum. He pitched six scoreless innings, the 65th time his career he has produced at least six scoreless innings. In the May 25 contest versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, he reached 3,000 career innings, the 135th pitcher in major league history to achieve this milestone. On June 4, 2021, Greinke threw a complete game for the first time since April 19, 2017. He allowed six hits with one run and one walk and three strikeouts in a 13–1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York.

In 2021, Greinke finished with an 11–6 record and 4.16 ERA over 30 games (29 starts). He ranked second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.895) and fifth in WHIP (1.170) and home runs (30). In the World Series versus the Atlanta Braves, Greinke started Game 4, recording four scoreless innings. At the plate, he singled in the second inning to become the first Astros pitcher to get a hit in World Series play. In Game 5, he was called in as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning and recorded a single, becoming the first pitcher to record a pinch hit in the World Series since Jack Bentley in . On November 3, 2021, Greinke was declared a free agent.

===Return to Kansas City Royals (2022–2023)===

Greinke expressed interest in finishing his career with the Royals, which he mentioned to George Brett during the 2021-22 lockout. On March 16, 2022, Greinke signed a one-year, $13 million contract to return to the Royals. On March 31, Greinke was announced as the Royals&#x27; Opening Day starter, the first time he&#x27;d been given the role for the Royals since 2010, marking the largest gap between Opening Day pitching starts for the same team. He made his 500th career start on June 29 versus the Texas Rangers, going six innings in a 2−1 win. Greinke finished 4–9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts with the Royals in 2022.

Greinke re-signed with the Royals on a one-year contract worth $8.5 million on February 3, 2023. On March 24, Greinke was named the Royals&#x27; Opening Day starter for the second consecutive year. On May 15, Greinke became the fifth pitcher (after Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, and Greg Maddux) to strike out 1,000 unique batters over his career. He became a free agent following the season.

== Pitching style ==

Greinke throws six different pitches:
* Four-seam fastball — 
* Two-seam fastball — 
* Cutter — 
* Slider — 
* Curveball — 
* Changeup — 

His curveball has two speeds with different types of movement, and he will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is thrown only to left-handed hitters. Greinke&#x27;s curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common two-strike pitch.

Greinke&#x27;s slider has been one of his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and .230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in play are ground balls. However, he limits the use of the slider in order not to put excessive strain on his arm.

Greinke has produced good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league&#x27;s top 10 five times and ranking eighth among active pitchers in the category, at 3.76:1 as of the end of the 2017 regular season.

Greinke has been described as a &quot;scientist as a pitcher&quot; and is known for preparing for each start more extensively than most.

Owing to his upright overhand pitching style, with a pause where the ball is hidden down next to his right knee before release, a forward-facing follow-through, and late movement that reaches the lower third of the strike zone, he is in an excellent position for fielding soft, short hits coming at him, which helped him gain many assists and six consecutive NL Gold Glove Awards as a pitcher. He was still awarded an NL Gold Glove in 2019 because he started the 2019 season in Arizona before being traded.

== Batting ==
Greinke is a good hitting pitcher, having won two Silver Slugger Awards in his career with a .225 batting average. He has also amassed nine stolen bases over his career (on ten stolen base attempts), and he has expressed a desire to end his career with ten home runs and ten stolen bases; he has nine of each, with his last home run and stolen base each being in 2019. He entered Game 5 of the 2021 World Series as a pinch-hitter and recorded a hit, being the first pitcher to have a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in . As of 2025, he is the last pitcher to have a hit in a postseason game, as the designated hitter was introduced in the National League in 2022, meaning that the pitcher is not required to hit at any point. In his fourth at-bat as a major leaguer, Greinke hit his first home run. Years later, when teammate Alex Gordon was in a slump, Greinke had the idea to take him into the video room and show the clip of his home run multiple times before leaving by saying, &quot;Do more of that.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Greinke is married to Emily Kuchar, whom he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008. Their sons were born in 2015, 2017, and 2021. They reside in Orlando, Florida.

Greinke&#x27;s younger brother, Luke, was also a pitcher who played college baseball at Auburn University. Luke was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round (380th overall) of the 2008 MLB draft, but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.

<text>Club Sport Marítimo MH M, commonly known as Marítimo ( locally ) or Marítimo da Madeira, is a Portuguese professional sports club based in the city of Funchal, on the island of Madeira. Established in 1910, Marítimo is best known for its football team currently playing in Liga Portugal 2 that previously played for 38 consecutive years in the Primeira Liga from 1985 to 2023.

The club&#x27;s reserve team, Marítimo B, compete in the fourth division, and the female team feature in the top-tier Campeonato Nacional Feminino. Aside from football, Marítimo have teams in other sports competing in national leagues, such as volleyball, handball, roller hockey and athletics. Marítimo supporters are called &quot;Maritimistas&quot;.

The football club has won one major trophy, the Campeonato de Portugal in 1926. After a long period of being restricted to regional competitions, Marítimo made their inaugural appearance in the national league in 1973 and four years later became the first club based outside Portuguese continental territory to achieve promotion to the top division in 1977. Since then the club has played 43 seasons in the highest tier of Portuguese league football – ranking 10th on the all-time list – as well as being finalists of the Taça de Portugal twice, finalists of the Taça da Liga twice, winning the Segunda Divisão twice and achieving nine appearances in the UEFA Cup/Europa League. Marítimo&#x27;s most recent foray into European competition came in 2017, though their best performance was during the 2012–13 season, finishing third in the Europa League group stage.

==History==

Marítimo was founded on 20 September 1910 as &quot;Club Português de Sport Marítimo&quot;, by Cândido Fernandes de Gouveia. The club adopted the red and green colours of the new Republican flag of Portugal to distinguish themselves from rivals Club Sports da Madeira, who used the blue and white colours of the old monarchy flag which had been replaced 15 days earlier. The name &quot;Marítimo&quot;, meaning Maritime in English, was used to reflect the fact that many of the team&#x27;s players were workers of the nearby Funchal docks, a prominent employer at the time. The first ever match for Marítimo was a 2–1 win against Santa Clara, a select team composed of workers of the Western Telegraph Company. Soon after they began playing teams of sailors from visiting British ships. José Rodrigues Barrinhas, an old-fashioned attacking centre-half, made a name for himself in these games and in matches against rivals CS Madeira.

In 1921–22, the Portuguese clubs started playing a new national competition. The Campeonato de Portugal, played on a knock-out-basis (similar to the current Taça de Portugal), was the first national competition. After competing in the regional championships, the regional winners competed together to pick the Champion of Portugal. Marítimo make 13 appearances in the 17 editions of the competition. After several attempts, the club finally won the Campeonato de Portugal in 1925–26. In the semi-final against Porto, Marítimo won 7–1, and in the final against Belenenses Marítimo won 2–0. It was after this great achievement that Marítimo was called &quot;The Greatest of the Islands&quot;.

In the early 1930s, the club faced a serious financial crisis, although this did not affect its supremacy in the regional competitions. However, in 1934, a new national competition called Primeira Liga was created, in which teams outside the continental territory were excluded. Nevertheless, in 1938–39 the teams from the islands started to participate in the Taça de Portugal, after the champions of Madeira and Azores played a qualification round between themselves.
Being excluded from competing in the Primeira Liga, the club continued playing in regional competitions. It was in this period that Marítimo won many of the Regional Championships. In 1950, the team went through an amazing tour of Africa in which they made some great achievements.
After arduous negotiations with the Portuguese Football Federation, it was established that the winner in the regional championship of 1972–73 could play a qualifying round with the last of the Segunda Divisão and the first of the Terceira Divisão. Marítimo won that regional championship and started to participate in the national championships. They therefore became the first team from a Portuguese island to participate in the national championship. Maritimo&#x27;s record of 35 Madeira Championships won between 1916 and 1973 still stands.

The consequences of long years without being able to compete regularly in national competitions were visible in the beginning. The fact that the island was not able to put teams in national competitions showed the discrepancies in terms of infrastructures and organization between the regional and national reality. Yet in the 1976–77 season the club wins the II Divisão and rises to the Portuguese First Division, remaining there for over three seasons. Due to the existing semi-professionalism and some logistical difficulties, the club is relegated to Second Division in 1980–181, rising immediately next season, winning for the second time the II Divisão. After two seasons the club returns to Primeira Liga in the 1982–83 season. Since then the club has remained in the Primeira Liga, consolidating its status as a team that consistently finishes in the top ten and competes for European qualification.

Until the early 1990s, the club&#x27;s best result was 9th in the 1987–88 season. The entry of a young coach, ambitious Brazilian Paulo Autuori, allied to greater internal organization and attractive attacking football, so that in the 1991–92 campaign the club reached seventh place, staying just outside European qualification. The 1992–93 season saw a &quot;wonder-trio&quot; (Ademir, Edmilson and Jorge Andrade) drive the club to have the third best attack of the league, with 56 goals. European qualification came in the final round, with a 3–2 victory against Boavista. Again the club was a pioneer, being the first island team to achieve qualification for European competitions, under the 5th place achieved. That same season is also notable for the home wins against Sporting (4–2) and Gil Vicente (7–0).

In 1994–95, another great achievement was made when the club qualified to the Taça de Portugal finals for the first time in its history, after defeating Porto in the semi-finals 1–0. Marítimo disputed the final against Sporting, but lost 2–0. Six years later, in the 2000–01 season, Marítimo achieved the final again, after defeating Boavista in the semi-final 1–0. This time Marítimo played the final against Porto, losing again 2–0. However, as of 2023, Marítimo still remain the only club from Madeira to have reached the Portuguese Cup final.

From the 2001–02 to the 2014–15 season, the club has finished in the top ten of the table, with the exception of the 2006–07 season, where they finished eleventh. In the 2014–15 season, Maritimo reached the League Cup final for the first time ever, beating Porto in the semi-final but then losing to Benfica 2–1. The following season they repeated this feat, playing against Benfica again, but losing 6–2. The best ever league finish Maritimo have obtained was 5th place, first obtained in 1992–93, and since then they have finished another five times in that position, most recently in the 2011–12 season. In the 2012–13 season, Marítimo qualified for the Europa League group stages for the first time ever, finishing third with a win against Club Brugge and two draws against Newcastle United.

==Colours and crest==
Since the very beginning of the club&#x27;s history, red and green have been the official colours. In 1910, the club adopted the red and green colours of the new Republican flag of Portugal to distinguish themselves from rivals Club Sports da Madeira, who used the blue and white colours of the old monarchy flag which had been replaced 15 days after the clubs foundation, following the 5 October 1910 revolution.

Although there is no date or author, the first crest clearly refers to the maritime origins of the club, which is stated in the paddle, the float, the harpoon, and the anchor. The ball in the badge represents the sport played in the club.

For the 1916–17 season, a new crest was created by José Inês Ramos, a designer at an Embroidery House in Funchal. The new crest maintains the maritime roots of the club, expressed in the ship&#x27;s wheel. However a Lion was included in the new crest, which was to symbolize the strength of the new Champion of Madeira. Since then the crest has remained the same, with only some minor graphical changes over the years. The crest was updated again in 1999 to a modern version, following the formation of the SAD organisation, however the classic logo remained on the team jerseys until 2008. In 2022, the club announced the return of the classic crest, used from 1916 to 1999, as the primary logo.

==Support==
Marítimo are known throughout the Portuguese speaking world and have significant fan bases in the former Portuguese colonies of Brazil, Angola, and Cape Verde, as well as areas with significant Portuguese communities such as the Northeastern United States, Canada, the United Kingdom (specifically Jersey and London) and South Africa.

The club also has a big fans base in Venezuela, where sister club Marítimo de Venezuela of Caracas have won several national Championships. The club was founded in 1959 by Portuguese immigrants living in Caracas, who based their new club on their favourite team from back home in Madeira. Even today, strong ties are kept between both clubs and supporters from either side of the Atlantic Ocean. A similar situation is present in Cape Verde, where Marítimo do Porto Novo play in the same green and red stripes when competing in the Santo Antão Island League (South).

Closer to home, the club has a proud reputation of being one of the most supported clubs in Portugal after the &quot;big three&quot;, and the most popular club on their home island of Madeira, outranking local rivals Nacional and União. The club has over 10,000 registered members (&quot;sócios&quot;) and three predominant groups of Ultras, the &quot;Esquadrão Maritimista&quot;, &quot;Ultras Templários&quot; and &quot;Fanatics 1910&quot;.

There are several famous fans of Marítimo who have publicly declared their support for the team on various occasions, such as the multimillionaire businessman Joe Berardo and Madeira&#x27;s Regional Governor, the controversial politician Alberto João Jardim.

The club was used a political vehicle in the 1970s during Madeira&#x27;s fight for freedom and autonomy from mainland Portugal. Governor Jardim proclaimed his support of the club in order to gain votes and the backing from the people of Madeira, while the people in turn supported Marítimo as a symbol of their pride and allegiance to Madeira.

==Stadium==
Previously playing at the Campo do Almirante Reis until they moved out in 1935, Marítimo currently play their home games at the Estádio do Marítimo, the municipality stadium of Funchal. The stadium was originally built by rival club Nacional but came into the hands of the local Government after the club fell into a financial crisis. Although uniquely picturesque the stadium was rapidly aging, despite numerous face lifts over the years.

In October 2006, it was announced that the club would construct a new state-of-the-art stadium in the Praia Formosa area of West Funchal. However, after several delays and a political war over funding and planning, the stadium plans were put on hold indefinitely, adding to a list of set-backs that stretch well over a decade. The fact that archrivals Nacional were allowed to construct a new stand and training facility at their Estádio da Madeira (with government backing) angered Marítimo&#x27;s fans even more.

A year later, on 14 September 2007, an agreement between the club&#x27;s directors and the Madeiran government (of whom own a 40% share of the club) was reached to use the site of the current Estádio dos Barreiros as the location of a brand new, reconstructed commercial stadium. Work began on the new stadium on 20 July 2009, with the realigning of the pitch and demolition of the Bancada Nascente, reducing the capacity to 5,000 seats in the Bancada Central stand. Initial plans indicated that the stadium would be completed by 2011 but following the 2010 flooding disaster, the local government withdrew its funding and construction was halted. The club continued to use the stadium with only the Bancada Central (main stand) usable as the other three sides of the pitch were incomplete. On 25 March 2013, the club opened a new museum and club shop adjacent to the stadium.

After a four-year hiatus, the local government pledged €12 million towards the project and construction of the stadium resumed in May 2014. The initial work focused on finishing the three stands that had been left incomplete from the previous work and so a further reduction in capacity was made, bringing the number of usable seats to just 4,000. The new stands were finished and open to the public in January 2015, with the first game being played in front of 7,000 spectators on 18 January against Braga. The following week, demolition started on the main stand to make way for the completion of the stadium project. The current capacity of the stadium is 9,500, which will be boosted to 10,600 once the construction of the stands is complete (2 December).

The club also own the Campo da Imaculada Conceição, a small stadium in the north of Funchal. The land it stands on was purchased by supporters and donated to the club who thus constructed the stadium, which was officially inaugurated on 3 October 1965. Situated adjacent to the club&#x27;s Complexo Desportivo, the ground is used for B team-matches and for training sessions.

===Attendances===
The attendances of Marítimo&#x27;s home games were on a steady decline since the late 1990s, with the average attendance filling just half of the stadium&#x27;s capacity for many seasons. The beginning of the work on the new stadium in July 2009 initially reduced capacity to 5,000 seats, which also contributed to a decline of attendances. After opening three new stands in 2015 (7,200 seats) the attendances started to increase, and the following year it reached a record attendance of the last sixteen years.

<text>A chapel royal is an establishment in the British and Canadian royal households serving the spiritual needs of the sovereign and the royal family.

Historically, the chapel royal was a body of priests and singers that travelled with the monarch. The term is now also applied to the chapels within royal palaces, or a title granted to churches by the monarch. In the Church of England, working royal chapels may also be referred to as royal peculiars, an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the monarch. The dean of His Majesty&#x27;s chapels royal is a royal household office in the United Kingdom that, in modern times, is usually held by the Bishop of London. In Canada, the three chapels royal are affiliated with some of the country&#x27;s First Nations.

A British chapel royal&#x27;s most public role is to perform choral liturgical service. The British chapels royal have played a significant role in the musical life of the nation, with composers such as Tallis, Byrd, Bull, Gibbons, and Purcell all having been members of the choir. The choir consists of gentlemen of the chapel royal singing the lower parts alongside the boy choristers known as the children of the chapel.

Outside the United Kingdom and Canada, there is also another royal chapel, St. Peter&#x27;s Church - Their Majesties Chappell, located in St. George&#x27;s Parish, Bermuda. 
==History==
===Middle Ages===
In its early history, the English Chapel Royal travelled, like the rest of the court, with the monarch and performed its functions wherever he or she was residing at the time. The earliest written record of the Chapel dates from , in the reign of Henry I. Specified in this document of household regulations are two gentlemen and four servants; although, there may have been other people within the Chapel at that time. An ordinance from the reign of Henry VI sets out the full membership of the Chapel as of 1455: one dean, 20 chaplains and clerks, seven children, one chaplain confessor for the household, and one yeoman. However, in the same year, the clerks petitioned the King asking that their number be increased to 24 singing men, due to . The master of the children of the Chapel Royal had, until at least 1684, the power to impress promising boy trebles from provincial choirs for service in the Chapel. 

From the reign of Edward IV in the late 1400s, further details survive: There were 26 chaplains and clerks, who were to be in their singing and . The children were supervised by a master of song, chosen by the dean from among the gentlemen of the Chapel Royal. They were allocated supplies of meat and ale and their own servant. Additionally, there were two yeoman of the Chapel, who acted as epistlers, reading from the bible during services. These were appointed from children of the Chapel whose voices had recently broken.

===Tudor period===
The Chapel remained stable throughout the reign of Henry VIII and the dissolution of the monasteries. The number of singers did vary during this period, however, without apparent reason, from between 20 to 30 gentlemen and eight to 10 children. The Chapel travelled with the King to the Field of the Cloth of Gold and during the second invasion of France.

The Chapel increasingly took on another, unofficial function that grew in importance into the 17th centuryperforming in dramas. The affiliated theatre company, known as the Children of the Chapel, produced plays by playwrights including John Lyly, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman, and performed them at court and then commercially until the 1620s. Both the gentlemen and the children would act in pageants and plays for the royal family, held in court on feast days such as Christmas. For example, at Christmas 1514, the play &quot;The Triumph of Love and Beauty&quot; was written and presented by William Cornysh, then-Master of the Children, and was performed to the King by members of the Chapel, including the children.

In music, the Chapel achieved its greatest eminence during the reign of Elizabeth I, when William Byrd and Thomas Tallis were joint organists.

===17th century===
In the 17th century, the Chapel Royal had its own building in Whitehall, which burned in 1698; since 1702, it has been based at St James&#x27;s Palace. The English Chapel Royal became increasingly associated with Westminster Abbey, so that, by 1625, over half of the gentlemen of the English Chapel Royal were also members of the Westminster Abbey choir. In the 18th century, the choristers sang the soprano parts in performances of Handel&#x27;s oratorios and other works. Under Charles II, the choir was often augmented by violinists from the royal consort; at various times, the Chapel has also employed composers, lutenists, and viol players.

==Functions and functionaries in the chapels royal of the United Kingdom==
The Chapel Royal in the United Kingdom is a department of the Ecclesiastical Household, which was established in 1483, under Edward IV, as the Royal Free Chapel of the Household. The Chapel Royal, in this sense, is a grouping of clerics and musicians, rather than a physical building. Traditionally, the members of the Chapel Royal are divided into clerics, choristers, and gentlemen of the Chapel. The Chapel Royal is a royal peculiara church institute outside the usual diocesan structure of the Churches of England and Scotland. It is one of the three major royal peculiars, the others being Westminster Abbey and St George&#x27;s Chapel, which includes the Royal Chapel of All Saints. The members of the ecclesiastical household in Scotland are supplied by the Church of Scotland, while the members of ecclesiastical household in England are supplied by the Church of England.

Since the 18th century, the dean of the Chapel Royal in England has been the sitting Bishop of London, with control of music vested in the sub-dean (currently Paul Wright). The Chapel Royal conducts the Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in Whitehall and combines with the choir of the host abbey or cathedral at the Royal Maundy service. The choir was among those selected to sing at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in 2023.

==Locations==
===United Kingdom===
The location of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Chapel Royal has varied over the years. For example, in the early Tudor period and in Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, the Chapel&#x27;s activity was often centred on the Greenwich Palace and the Palace of Whitehall. During the reign of King Charles III, the Chapel&#x27;s primary location is at St James&#x27;s Palace.

====St James&#x27;s Palace====
The chapel at St James&#x27;s has been regularly used by the canons and singers since 1702, after the loss of the Chapel Royal at Whitehall Palace to fire, and is the most commonly used facility today. Located in the main block of the palace, it was built around 1540 and has been altered since, most notably by Sir Robert Smirke in 1837. The large window to the right of the palace gatehouse is in the north wall of this chapel, which is laid out on a north-south, rather than the usual east-west, axis. Its ceiling is decorated with royal initials and coats of arms and is said to have been painted by Holbein.
The separate Queen&#x27;s Chapel, once also physically connected to the main building of St James&#x27;s Palace, was built between 1623 and 1625 as a Roman Catholic chapel for Queen Henrietta Maria, consort of Charles I, at a time when the construction of Roman Catholic churches was otherwise prohibited in England. From the 1690s, it was used by continental Lutheran courtiers and became known as the German chapel. The &quot;Minister for many years&quot; of the &quot;royal French chapel&quot; at St James&#x27;s Palace was Pierre Rival (d. 1730), one of whose sermons is published as . The adjacent palace apartments burnt down in 1809; but, they were not rebuilt and, between 1856 and 1857, Marlborough Road was laid out between the palace and the Queen&#x27;s Chapel.

====Windsor====
At Windsor Castle is one of the largest royal peculiars, St George&#x27;s Chapel. However, it is governed by its own college, separate from St. James&#x27;s Chapel Royal. Near the royal apartments, there is also the smaller private chapel. In the grounds of Windsor&#x27;s Royal Lodge is the Royal Chapel of All Saints.

====Scotland====
In the 15th century, it is believed that the Chapel Royal referred to a prebend in the Church of St Mary on the Rock, at St Andrews. In 1501, James IV founded a new Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle; but, from 1504 onwards, the deanery of the Chapel Royal was held by successive Bishops of Galloway with the title &quot;Bishop of the Chapel Royal&quot; and authority over all the royal palaces within Scotland. The deanery was annexed to the bishopric of Dunblane in 1621, and the Chapel Royal was moved to Holyrood. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, a mob in Edinburgh broke into the abbey, entered the Chapel Royal, and desecrated the royal tombs. From then on, the building fell into decay and became a roofless ruin. The restoration of the abbey has been proposed several times since the 18th centuryin 1835, by the architect James Gillespie Graham as a meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and in 1906, as a chapel for the Knights of the Thistlebut both proposals were rejected.

====Other chapels royal====
At the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace, a permanent chorus was created in 1868. The chorus, which sings on Sundays and major feast days, consists of 14 boy members and six gentlemen members. An organ was built in 1712 and, most recently, restored in 2013.
Two patronised chapels royal almost never attended by the monarch are the Chapels of St John the Evangelist and St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, having their own chaplains and choirs. In 2012, Roger Hall, the Chaplain of the Tower of London, was made canon of the Chapel Royal at the Tower of London, the first such appointment since the 16th century. In 2016, the King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy in Westminster, London, which is the monarch&#x27;s by right of the Duchy of Lancaster, was brought for ecclesiastical purposes within the jurisdiction of the chapels royal. Chapels with a royal original purpose, but currently without royal patronage, include the Royal Chapel of St Katherine-upon-the-Hoe in the Royal Citadel in Plymouth. However, in 1927, King George V re-granted the title &quot;royal chapel&quot; to the Garrison Church.

Several other locations have formerly hosted the Chapel Royal, including the former Chapel Royal in Brighton. This was used by visiting royalty and as the primary chapel of ease to St Peter&#x27;s Church. The chapel was formally separated from St. Peter&#x27;s parish in 2010 and became a parish in its own right. Another former chapel royal was situated in Dublin, prior to the independence of Ireland in the 1920s. The Chapel Royal in Dublin operated within Dublin Castle, which served as the official seat for the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Buckingham Palace had a royal chapel designed by John Nash for Queen Victoria but it was damaged by enemy bombing in World War II and what was left was eventually incorporated into the Queen&#x27;s Gallery.

===Canada===
Chapels royal in Canada are religious establishments which have been granted a rare honorific distinction by the monarch in recognition of their unique role or place. Three sanctuaries in Canada, all located in the province of Ontario, have been designated as chapels royal. All have associations with First Nations communities and the connection between them and the Canadian Crown.

Mohawk Chapel in Brantford was designated as a chapel royal in 1904 by King Edward VII. This was done in recognition of the historic alliance between the Mohawk people and the Crown, referred to as the Covenant Chain. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II designated Christ Church, near Deseronto, as a chapel royal. The chapel served as the church for the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory and was designated as a chapel royal in recognition of the community&#x27;s military service.

The first two chapels royal are situated within Mohawk communities that were established in Canada after the American Revolutionary War. Several gifts from the Crown were bestowed on these chapels royal, including silver communion services and a Bible from Queen Anne, a triptych from King George III, a Bible from Queen Victoria, and a bicentennial chalice from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2010, Elizabeth II presented to the Mohawk Chapel a set of silver hand bells engraved with the words &quot;Silver Chain of Friendship, 1710–2010&quot;, to commemorate the tricentennial of the first meeting between Mohawk representatives and the Crown.
In April 2016, the Queen approved in principle that St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel in Toronto be designated a chapel royal. The chapel itself is situated within Massey College, a college of the University of Toronto, conceived by Vincent Massey, a former governor general of Canada. It became Canada&#x27;s third chapel royal on 21 June, National Indigenous Peoples Day, 2017. St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel is the first interfaith and interdenominational chapel royal and the only one with its own title in an Indigenous language. It was designated as a chapel royal in recognition of the sesquicentennial of Canada, the relationship between Massey College and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, and as a gesture of reconciliation. The chapel acknowledge the history of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and its ratification by the Treaty of Niagara in 1764 

===Bermuda===
Their Majesties Chappell is located in St. George&#x27;s Parish, Bermuda. It was first designated as such in a royal warrant dated 18 March 1697 during the joint reign of King William and Queen Mary, and reconfirmed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 18 March 2012. St. Peter&#x27;s - Their Majesties Chappell stands as the oldest surviving Anglican church in continuous use outside the British Isles.

<text>Clube Desportivo Nacional, commonly known as Nacional and sometimes Nacional da Madeira (), is a Portuguese football club based in Funchal, on the island of Madeira.

Founded on 8 December 1910, it currently plays in the Liga Portugal , Portugal&#x27;s top-tier division of professional football. It plays its home games at Estádio da Madeira, also known as Estádio da Choupana. Built in 1998 and named at the time &quot;Estádio Eng. Rui Alves&quot; after the current club president Rui Alves, it seats approximately 5,132 people. The stadium is located in the north of Funchal, high in the mountains of the Choupana district. The club&#x27;s home colours are black and white striped shirts with black shorts and socks. Nacional is also known for being one of the clubs that formed Portuguese international Cristiano Ronaldo and to honour the club&#x27;s most famous player they named their youth training facilities &quot;Cristiano Ronaldo Câmpus Futebol&quot;.

The &quot;Alvinegros&quot; played in the Primeira Liga in 1988–91, 2002–17, 2018–19 and 2020–21. Their best top-tier league finish was fourth in the 2003–04 and 2008–09 seasons, with Brazilian striker Nenê winning the Bola da Prata for top scorer with 20 goals in the latter. They have played in the UEFA Europa League on five occasions between 2004 and 2014, beating Zenit St. Petersburg in the play-off round and taking third place in the group stage in 2009–10. The team has reached the Taça de Portugal semi-finals four times between 2009 and 2023, and the Taça da Liga semi-final in 2010–11. Notable managers include Manuel Machado, who led the team in five spells from 2005 to 2021.In The 2023-2024 Primeira Liga 2 Nacional Had Got Promoted To The Primeira Liga

Like many other Portuguese clubs, Nacional operates several sports teams outside the football team. Other sports groups within the organisation include beach soccer, boxing, artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, tennis, triathlon, muay thai, padel, rallying, swimming and veterans&#x27; soccer.

==History==
Nacional reached the first division for the first time ever with a three-season spell from 1988. Under manager José Peseiro, the team returned for 2002–03 after winning promotion in third place. The team finished comfortably in 11th, with results including a 1–0 home win over S.L. Benfica on 28 September 2002 and a 3–2 win at C.S. Marítimo in the Madeira derby the following 2 February. Peseiro&#x27;s successor Casemiro Mior took the team to a joint-best 4th place in 2003–04, including another home win over Benfica, shortly after that team had knocked them out of the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal. Stars of this team included Brazilians Paulo Assunção (defensive midfielder) and forward Adriano (16 and 19 goals in respective seasons), both of whom later played for FC Porto.

Nacional&#x27;s debut European season in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup ended in the first round with a 4–1 aggregate loss to Spain&#x27;s Sevilla FC. In January 2005, Mior left for Club Athletico Paranaense in his homeland. Manuel Machado led the team to fifth in 2005–06, again reaching the UEFA Cup, but left due to his wife and children living in continental Portugal. The club&#x27;s second run in European competition again ended at the first hurdle, 3–1 on aggregate to CS Rapid București of Romania.
Under the returning Machado in 2008–09, again edged S.C. Braga for fourth spot. Brazilian forward Nenê earned the Bola da Prata for top scorer with 20 goals, three more than Benfica&#x27;s Óscar Cardozo and Sporting CP&#x27;s Liédson. The side also reached the last-four in the Portuguese Cup, losing on aggregate 5–4 to F.C. Paços de Ferreira, with the decider coming at the &quot;Estádio da Madeira&quot; in the 90th minute.

Nacional started the 2009–10 season without Nenê, who was sold in June to Cagliari Calcio of the Italian Serie A for a fee potentially rising to €10 million. However, in August the club won a European tie for the first time, defeating 2008 champions FC Zenit Saint Petersburg 5–4 on aggregate in the playoffs of the renamed UEFA Europa League; the team were heading out on the away goals rule until a last-minute goal from youngster Rúben Micael earned a 1–1 draw in Russia. Nacional were eliminated in the group stage, third behind SV Werder Bremen and Athletic Bilbao but ahead of FK Austria Wien. In 2010–11, former club players Predrag Jokanović and Ivo Vieira led the team to 6th and a European return, as well as the semi-finals of the Taça da Liga for the first time (at Porto&#x27;s expense), losing 4–3 to Paços de Ferreira. In the following season, following Europa League playoff elimination by Birmingham City, the team made the national cup semi-finals again, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Sporting.

In his fourth of five spells as Nacional manager, Machado led the team to 5th in 2013–14, making the Europa League playoffs and falling at the first hurdle 5–2 on aggregate to FC Dinamo Minsk of Belarus. In the 2014–15 Taça de Portugal they made a third semi-final in seven years, again losing to Sporting. The 2016–17 season, which included Jokanović&#x27;s fourth spell as manager, ended with relegation in last place, a conclusion to 15 years in the top flight.

Former Portugal international Costinha was hired in 2017 and won promotion at the first attempt as champions of the 2017–18 LigaPro; Cape Verde international striker Ricardo Gomes was the league&#x27;s top scorer with 22 goals in 36 games and left the club for FK Partizan in Serbia at the end of his contract. Costinha left after relegation from the 2018–19 Primeira Liga, in which results included a 10–0 loss to eventual winners Benfica.

The 2019–20 LigaPro was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal, resulting in promotion for first-placed Nacional; it was the sixth promotion in the career of 34-year-old manager Luís Freire. The team were immediately relegated in last place, with Freire sacked in March 2021 and Machado seeing out the season in his fifth spell. The team reached the semi-finals of the 2022–23 Taça de Portugal, losing 7–2 on aggregate to Braga, while the league season went to the final day; a 3–2 home win over Académico de Viseu F.C. after losing at half time saved the team in 14th place while B-SAD took the relegation playoff position.

==Stadium==
The Estádio da Madeira, better known as the &quot;Choupana&quot;, houses Nacional. The current stadium is located around nearby training pitches. The club also built an academy campus in name of its most famous player, Cristiano Ronaldo. The stadium was renovated in 2007 for a new stand and also increasing the capacity to over 5,000 spectators. The total price of the renovations was €20 million.

In these new facilities, no stands were put behind the goals, with a tall fence used in its place. In mid-2007, the stadium name was changed to &quot;Estádio da Madeira&quot;, because of the excellent sports facilities.

==Rivalry==
Nacional has a big rivalry with Madeira-neighbours Marítimo. Historically, Marítimo dominated Nacional in the early years, being the first to reach European competition.

<doc id="990747" wikidata="Q2639401" url="?curid=990747" title="Rathcoole, Dublin">
<text>Rathcoole () is an outer suburban village in County Dublin, Ireland, south-west of the city of Dublin, and in the local government area of South Dublin.

Rathcoole is also a civil parish in the Barony of Newcastle.

==Etymology==
 is the Irish word for a ringfort, a circular embankment often erected by wealthy farmers or local chiefs. There are several forts in the civil parish of Rathcoole, one in a field between the village and Saggart village. There is no definite explanation for the name &quot;Rathcoole&quot;, but it could be meaning &quot;the ringfort of Cumhaill&quot;, the father of Fionn mac Cumhaill. Coole may also come from the Irish word for forest, .

==Geography==
Rathcoole lies in the southwest &quot;corner&quot; of County Dublin, just off the N7 national primary road, southwest of Citywest and west of Saggart village. Close by to the north are Baldonnel and Casement Aerodrome, home of the Irish Air Corps. Also in this part of the county are Newcastle and, further away, Brittas.

Around Rathcoole are several streams, primarily draining the western end to the Griffeen River but south of the eastern end linking to the River Camac, both tributaries of the River Liffey. Aside from the village core, the area has housing developments such as &quot;Beechwood Lawns&quot;, located between the main street and the park, &quot;Forest Hills&quot;, &quot;Broadfield Manor&quot; to the west, and &quot;Peyton&quot; to the south.

==History==
Like neighbouring Saggart and nearby Newcastle, Rathcoole was on the periphery of the Pale and was the site of many battles with mountain-based rebels, particularly the Byrnes and O&#x27;Tooles.

The village had a licence to hold a trading fair three times a year, a tradition that lapsed in the 19th century.

The village was the birthplace in 1765 of the United Irishman Felix Rourke, and another local, a member of the Clinch family of Rathcoole House, was executed after the 1798 rising.

In the late 18th century Rathcoole was composed mainly of mud huts, and as late as the early 20th century it consisted of only one street.

===Mercer&#x27;s Charter School===

In 1743-45, a new charter school was constructed in the village with the funds from the endowment of Mary Mercer. The school had earlier been located at Mercer&#x27;s Hospital from the 1720s but this site had later been deemed an unsuitable location to house the girls. The school operated until 1826 when it closed and moved to Castleknock to take over the former Morgan Trust school and merged into The King&#x27;s Hospital school in 1970. The building was later used as a glebe house for over a century.

As of October 2024, the building it still standing but has been badly damaged by fire.

===Rathcoole House===
Rathcoole is home to Rathcoole House, which was part of a wider estate. The house was built in 1750 and initially belonged to the Clinch family, later passing to the Sheils of Coolmine, who owned it from 1831 to 1962. The house had two main floors above ground and five bays, with a kitchen, milling room and stores in the basement, and a hall, dining room and drawing room on the ground floor. Part of the house was demolished in 1933 and was bought in 2013 by a private investor. As of 2019, it is a privately owned residence.

==Amenities==
Rathcoole has a well-maintained landscaped park, run by South Dublin County Council, at the eastern end of the village. There is also a community centre which caters for local events and training courses.

There is a small supermarket, a bank and a credit union, and two service stations on the N7. One of Rathcoole&#x27;s best-known pubs is &quot;An Poitin Stil&quot;, which is built on the site of an original inn dating back to 1649. The other pubs in the area are Muldowneys, Baurnafea House, and The Rathcoole Inn.

A pub existed for many years a short distance outside the town on the Naas Road (now N7) named The Blackchurch Inn. On 11 November 2019 it was closed temporarily by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland due to high levels of E.coli and coliforms which were found in drinking water and ice samples during an inspection, but re-opened some days later. The pub is closed as of April 2022.

==Transport==
Rathcoole is served by the Dublin Bus route number 69, which runs from here to Dublin city.

The Luas Red Line isn’t far from Rathcoole. The nearest stop is Saggart, which is the western terminus for the red line. It is a 6 minute walk from Rathcoole and a 45 minute journey to Dublin city.

At An Poitín Stil there is a bus stop which is a stop for the &quot;126&quot; which goes from Newbridge to Dublin city.

Near the Avoca there is a bus stop with has the W6 bus which goes from Maynooth to The Square via Newcastle in Tallaght

== Education ==
Holy Family Community School at the western end of the village recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary. It is a secondary school for students from Rathcoole and those commuting from the nearby towns of Clondalkin and Tallaght and the villages of Saggart and Brittas. There is also Holy Family National School located at the western end of Forest Hills, and a Gaelscoil, Scoil Chrónáin, in Rathcoole village itself.

==Sport==
The Rathcoole soccer club is Rathcoole Football Club. Commercials Hurling Club, a GAA club, is located just off the Naas Road. The local basketball club is Rathcoole Rockets.

Rathcoole is close to two golf courses: Citywest and Beech Park.

Coolmine Equestrian Centre was established here in 1989, providing horse riding lessons and guided horseback trips. This equestrian centre welcomes international guests here on educational programmes, work experience and holidays. The centre became an Equestrian Academy and is now known locally as CEAD-Ireland. The academy hosts festivals during the summer, with dance, music, pony rides, pet farms, dog shows and equestrian competitions.

<text>A motor drive, in the field of photography, is a powered film transport mechanism. Historically, film loading, advancing, and rewinding were all manually driven functions.

The desires of professional photographers for more efficient shooting, particularly in sports and wildlife photography, and the desires of amateur and novice photographers for easier to use cameras both drove the development of automatic film transport. Some early developments were made with clockwork drives, but most development in the field has been in the direction of electrically driven transport.

At first, motor drives were external units that attached to the basic camera body, normally beneath it, with an interface consisting of a physical drive socket and some electrical contacts to signal the drive when to actuate. Beginning in the late 1970s, motor drives began to be integrated into cameras themselves—at first, in compact cameras for the beginner market, and by the 1980s, in amateur-grade and later professional-grade single lens reflex cameras. By the 1990s, the vast majority of 35mm cameras had integral motor drive, and the feature found its way into some medium format cameras as well.

Motor drives for compact and amateur cameras wind slowly—shot-to-shot intervals of approximately a second are commonplace. Professional grade cameras are faster, with speeds up to ten frames per second (fps). The first 35 mm SLR to achieve such a shooting speed was Nikon&#x27;s F High Speed Motor Drive camera, first developed for the 1971 Chicago Photo Expo with 7 fps. To enable this speed and allow the photographer to more easily track the moving subject, this camera used a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror instead of a moving mirror. Later special Canon models used similar mechanisms to achieve such speeds, while cameras with moving mirrors reached approximately five frames per second by the 1980s. Today, the fastest professional models from Canon and Nikon achieve approximately ten frames per second with a moving mirror.

In the digital camera era, some users continue to refer to continuous shooting modes as &quot;motor drive&quot;. Many camera models refer to different shooting modes—single shot, burst, continuous, self timer—as drive modes, thus keeping alive the terminology of film. An external battery grip is occasionally referred to as a motor drive as it tends to increase the frame rate.

<text>Association de la Jeunesse Auxerroise (), commonly known as AJ Auxerre or by the abbreviation AJA, is a French professional football club based in the commune of Auxerre in Burgundy. The club plays in Ligue 1, the top division of French football, since the 2024–25 season after securing promotion from Ligue 2 as winners of the 2023–24 season. Auxerre plays its home matches at the Stade de l&#x27;Abbé-Deschamps, on the banks of the Yonne River. The team is managed by Christophe Pélissier.

Auxerre was founded in 1905 and made its debut in the first division of French football in the 1980–81 season, remaining in the premier league until the 2011–12 season. The club has won the Ligue 1 title once, in the 1995–96 season. Two years prior, Auxerre achieved its first major honour by winning the Coupe de France in 1994. The club has since added three more Coupe de France titles, which ties the club for the fifth-best standing among teams who have won the trophy.

Auxerre has produced several notable players during its existence. The club has most notably served as a springboard for several prominent French football players such as Eric Cantona, Laurent Blanc, Stéphane Guivarc&#x27;h, Philippe Mexès, Basile Boli, and Djibril Cissé, among others, who all became French internationals, with Blanc playing on the teams that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. Guivarc&#x27;h, Bernard Diomède and Lionel Charbonnier were the three footballers from Auxerre who were world champions in 1998. From 1961 to 2005, the club was predominantly coached by Guy Roux. This included an uninterrupted period when Roux was in charge for 36 years between 1964 and 2000.

== History ==

The club &quot;Association de la Jeunesse Auxerroise&quot; was founded in 1905, by the abbot Ernest Abbé Deschamps. The club success, becoming a force in the Catholic league F.G.S.P.F. In 1908, the club even reached the F.G.S.P.F. French Championship final, losing 8–1 however. At the end of the First World War, the club was expelled from its ground. Father Deschamps acquired several pieces of land along the Yonne on the Vaux road, which later formed the Abbé Deschamps Stadium.

Auxerre made its first steps in Division 1 on 24 July 1980 against Bastia in Toulon. Auxerre lost the match 2–0. On 20 November 1980, Andrzej Szarmach signed for Auxerre having received consent from the Polish Football Association. He started two days later at home against Lyon and scored the first of his ninety-four goals in Division 1. AJA&#x27;s first season in Division 1 was remarkable for two particular performances: on 13 December 1980, at Parc des Princes against Paris Saint-Germain (3–2), and then on 7 April 1981, at Stade Marcel-Saupin against Nantes for a 1–0 win, notable as Nantes had not lost a home game for five years and 92 games (between 15 April 1976 and 7 April 1981). In the next two seasons, AJA finished fifteenth and eighth respectively.

During the 1983–84 season, AJA climbed for the first time onto the podium in finishing third. Patrice Garande finished top scorer with twenty-one goals. A few weeks later, Garande won the gold medal at the Olympics in Los Angeles with the French Olympic football team while Joël Bats and Jean-Marc Ferreri were part of the victorious French team at UEFA Euro 1984. That summer, Auxerre recruited Michel N&#x27;Gom. An international prospect, he left Paris Saint-Germain. During pre-season, he scored five goals in ten games. On the last weekend before the start of the season, he visited his former teammates in Paris. He died following a traffic accident on 12 August 1984. To pay tribute, one of the stands at Abbé Deschamps bears his name. The 1984–1985 season saw Auxerre in European competition for the first time in its history by participating in the UEFA Cup, albeit with an unfavourable first round draw with Sporting Clube de Portugal. On 19 September 1984 at Estádio José Alvalade, AJA took its bow in European football with a 2–0 defeat. The return leg took place on 3 October 1984. AJA managed to retrieve the two goal deficit with a double by Szarmach, but eventually succumbed with two goals in extra time. However, by virtue of the victory of Monaco in the Coupe de France, AJA also qualified for the UEFA Cup the year after.

The 1985 offseason saw Joël Bats join Paris Saint-Germain. Auxerre recruited Bruno Martini as his successor. In the UEFA Cup, AJA were drawn against Milan. In the first leg, Auxerre won 3–1. Both teams missed a penalty and Paolo Maldini made his debut in European competition. In the return match, AJA lost 3–0 and was therefore eliminated. Seventh in the league and quarter-finalist in the French cup, AJA did not manage a third straight season in Europe. Auxerre finished fourth in 1986–1987, and was once again eliminated in the first round of the UEFA Cup the following season with a 2–0 away defeat to Panathinaikos too much to overcome in the return leg (which Auxerre won 3–2). The 1988–89 season saw AJA finish fifth in the league and reach the semi-finals of the Coupe de France before elimination by Marseille, the future winner of the event. With fifth place in the league, AJA made the UEFA Cup and there made its first decent run. During the preliminary round, AJA managed its first victory. Beaten 0–1 at home by Dinamo Zagreb, it registered 3–1 in Yugoslavia and qualified for the first round proper. Auxerre beat successively Albanians Apolonia Fier, Finns RoPS and Olympiacos of Greece before being eliminated in the quarterfinals by Fiorentina. In parallel with this, AJA managed sixth place in the league. During the summer of 1990, the AJA sold Basile Boli and recruited Enzo Scifo, Alain Roche and Zbigniew Kaczmarek. Auxerre finished in third place after leading the championship for two weeks.

In 1991–92, Auxerre was eliminated in the second round of the UEFA Cup by Liverpool and then finished fourth in Division 1. That summer, the AJA sold Alain Roche and Jean-Marc Ferreri while recruiting Frank Verlaat and Gérald Baticle. Auxerre then journeyed again into UEFA. Auxerre eliminated Lokomotiv Plovdiv and the newly formed Copenhagen. In the third round, AJA eliminated Standard Liège. In the quarterfinals, AJA faced Ajax, the defending champion and undefeated in the European Cup for two years. Before facing Ajax, Auxerre had suffered five consecutive league defeats. Auxerre managed a 4–2 home win. In the second leg, Ajax could only manage a 1–0 win and so Auxerre had qualified for the semi-finals, to face Borussia Dortmund. In the first leg in Germany, AJA lost 2–0. A fiercely contested second leg levelled the aggregate score, but Auxerre were finally eliminated on penalties.

While finishing sixth in the championship, Auxerre again qualified for the UEFA Cup after the VA-OM case. But unlike the epic run of the previous season, AJA was eliminated in the first round by Tenerife. AJA made progress in the league, with a third-place finish, but notably captured its first major trophy, the French cup. Having made it past the lower division teams in the early rounds, AJA eliminated Nantes in the semifinals before winning 3-0 at the Parc des Princes in the final against Montpellier. The following season, Auxerre finished fourth in the league and was a quarter-finalist of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup: Auxerre was eliminated by Arsenal in the Abbe-Deschamps (1–0) having achieved a 1–1 draw at Highbury.

During the 1995–96 season, the club won Division 1 for the first time in their history, and also won the Coupe de France.

On 13 May 2012, Auxerre&#x27;s 32-year stay in the top division came to an end after a 3–0 away defeat at the hands of Marseille. The following season, Auxerre finished a disappointing ninth place along with a goal difference of −2. The next season was no better for AJA, after they finished a lowly 16th position. Although not resulting in promotion, the 2014–15 Ligue 2 season was better for the Burgundy based side, as they finished ninth in Ligue 2 and finishing runners-up in the 2015 Coupe de France final after losing to Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade de France in front of an attendance of 80,000. The 2018–19 season was Auxerre&#x27;s seventh consecutive in the Ligue 2. In the 2020–21 Ligue 2 season, the Auxerrois would achieve their best finish in the second tier since their relegation with a 6th-place finish, although they were positioned within the top five required for at least the playoffs at the end of 17 of the 38 game weeks. In the 2021–22 Ligue 2 season, AJA were finally promoted back to Ligue 1 after ten years, after a penalty shoot-out win against Saint-Etienne in the Ligue 1 promotion/relegation play-offs.
After just one season in Ligue 1, Auxerre were relegated back to Ligue 2 after losing on the final day against Lens. Auxerre were one point clear of Nantes, but with Nantes securing a victory over already relegated Angers it meant Auxerre were the final team relegated. On 11 May 2024, Auxerre secure promotion to Ligue 1 for the 2024–25 season, after 1-1 draw against Amiens, champions of Ligue 2 in 2023–24, and returned to the top tier after a one year absence.

<text>Lille Olympique Sporting Club (), commonly referred to as LOSC, LOSC Lille or simply Lille, is a French professional football club based in Lille, Northern France competing in Ligue 1, the top division of French football. Lille have played their home matches since 2012 at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. The 50,186-capacity retractable roof venue is the fourth-largest stadium in France.

Lille were founded as a result of a merger between Olympique Lillois and SC Fives in 1944. Both clubs were founding members of the French Division 1 and Olympique Lillois were the league&#x27;s inaugural champions. The club&#x27;s most successful period was the decade from 1946 to 1956, in the post-war period, when the first-team won seven major trophies, including a league/cup double in 1946, and was known as &quot;La Machine de Guerre&quot; (French for &quot;The War Machine&quot;). Having won another double in 2011, their fourth league title in 2021 as well as their first Trophée des Champions the same year, Lille are the fourth best French club in the 21st century.

In domestic football, the club has won a total of four league titles, six Coupes de France and one Trophée des Champions since its foundation. In European football, Lille have participated in the UEFA Champions League nine times, reaching the knockout phase three times, competed in the UEFA Europa League on eight occasions and got to the UEFA Conference League quarter-finals once. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2004 after finishing as runners-up in 2002. Lille are also one of the rare clubs, still in the first division, to have at least 15 final top-three appearances in the history of the French championship.

Nicknamed &quot;Les Dogues&quot; (French for &quot;The Mastiffs&quot;), Lille are known for their academy which has produced and trained notable graduates. Throughout their history, they have cultivated a reputation for scouting and developing young players. Lille is the best club in the world regarding the financial balance of transfer transactions concerning non-academy players signed since 2015. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby side Lens, in which Lille lead in the head-to-head record and in terms of total trophies won. Owned by investment fund Merlyn Partners SCSp and headed by Olivier Létang, they are the fifth-most followed French sports club on social media.

==History==
===First decade of glory : The War Machine (1944–1955)===
Before the Second World War, the city of Lille had two clubs at the top level; Olympique Lillois and SC Fives. Olympique Lillois were crowned domestic champions in 1932–33, the first in the history of the championship that was created in 1932, and were runners-up in 1935–36. They also earned a USFSA Football Championship title in 1914, the French football top division before the creation of the French Division 1, and went to the Coupe de France final in 1939. Their neighbours, SC Fives, ranked second in 1933–34. They also went to the Coupe de France final, being defeated by Girondins AS Port in 1941. Weakened by the war, the two clubs decided to merge in the autumn of 1944, on 23 September, giving birth to Stade Lillois, renamed Lille Olympique Sporting Club a few weeks later. On 25 November 1944, the club is officially registered under its new name.

For its first season, the newborn club reached the 1945 Coupe de France final, with a squad composed of the best players of both merging teams, who are mostly natives of the Nord department. Next season, Lille won the double, beating Red Star in the 1946 Coupe de France Final and finishing at the first place of French Division 1 ahead of Saint-Étienne and Roubaix-Tourcoing. In 1947, Lille finished in the fourth place but came back to the Coupe de France final and retained the trophy, defeating Strasbourg. The club won the cup again in 1948 beating main rivals Lens, its third in a row, and were runners-up of the league the same year, behind Marseille that became the champions after a strong 1947–48 season finishing. They were also runners-up in 1948–49, 1949–50 and 1950–51. On 24 June 1951, an exhausted Lille reached the Latin Cup final and lost against Gre-No-Li&#x27;s AC Milan after having played 250 minutes in the span of two days.

On 31 May 1953, they got back to winning and earned their fourth Coupe de France trophy in a 2–1 final win against FC Nancy, before 60,000 spectators. The club then won its second domestic title in 1953–54, having only conceded 22 goals within 34 games. After this season, Lille is praised for its defensive proficiency and acquired a reputation as a rock-solid defense. A year later, &quot;Les Dogues&quot; earned their fifth Coupe de France in a 5–2 win against Bordeaux in the final. This period of glory and hegemony, occurring after the war and the German occupation of France, has led to one of the club&#x27;s nicknames: &quot;La Machine de Guerre&quot; (French for &quot;The War Machine&quot;). Within its first decade of existence, the club gathered the vast majority of its major trophies, winning two league titles and reaching the second place for four consecutive seasons. Lille, known as the best French club in the post-war period, accumulated five Coupe de France wins in seven finals, including five successive finals and winning the trophy three times in a row, one of the best performances in the history of the tournament.

===Decline and several spells in lower levels (1955–1978)===

The 1955–56 season happened to be highly complicated. The club suffered from internal conflicts, was contested and certain players refused to play some matches. In the field, the Northmen were way too irregular and crumbly in defense, and finished in 16th place. Lille were relegated for the first time in their history in 1956. This relegation is accompanied by aggravating financial consequences. Best players&#x27; departure is necessary to cover debts which are becoming substantial. Failing to rebuild a top team due to the increasingly poor financial situation, the club began a series of promotions and relegations. Promoted in 1957 by beating Rennes, Lille initially ended up to an unexpected 6th place. The club then finished in eighteenth place the following season; being relegated a second time. After a few years spent in Division 2, the club became a mid-table side in the late 1960s. From 1964 to 1968, the club managed somehow to avoid relegation to the lower level. After a long drought, the worst occurred when Lille abandoned its professional status on 23 June 1969, lacking facilities and resources.

A few seasons spent in amateur leagues later, Lille recreated its professional team by entering the second division in 1970, finished at the top of the division at the end of the season. The club began a new series of promotions and relegations in the 1970s. During this decade, the club&#x27;s accounts were largely in deficit. In order to cover debts, a support committee was founded and friendly matches were organized to raise funds. Famous clubs like Marseille or Feyenoord as well as nearby Belgian teams like Anderlecht and Standard Liège agreed to play against Lille to help the northern team. However, these ticket revenues only temporarily improve the club&#x27;s financial situation but the Lille city council was again forced to help and intervene. At the lower level, Lille missed out on promotion in 1973 by one point but were crowned Division 2 champions the following year. After finishing twice in 13th place, during the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons, the club was once again relegated in 1977.

===Reconstruction and reorganization (1978–2000)===

After years of back and forth, Lille finally returned to the top tier of French football at the end of the 1977–78 season. Until 1997, the club remained in the first division, becoming a perennial member of the Division 1. In the 1978–79, the Mastiffs had a good run and ended at 6th place, nearly qualifying for European competitions while being promoted. The following year, in July 1980, Lille was the first French club to opt for the status of a mixed economy company (SAEMS), of which the city of Lille became the majority shareholder and turned the club into a public-controlled enterprise. The new financial sustainability allows the club&#x27;s sporting stabilization in the elite division. LOSC then achieved some success stories in the decade, reaching the Coupe de France semi-finals in 1983 and 1985.

However, presidents Jacques Amyot, Roger Deschodt and Jacques Dewailly all struggled to compete with the top teams in the country and saw Lille staying in the familiar surroundings of mid-table. In 1991, Lille then-coached by Jacques Santini finished in sixth place, just two points from the European places; this is the club&#x27;s only appearance in the league table top half in the 1990s. After financial problems, Bernard Lecomte took over as president of the club in 1994 and saved it from administrative relegation the following year by negotiating with the governing bodies. During this period of austerity where the National Football League prohibited the club from recruiting, LOSC had to part ways with its star players, such as Antoine Sibierski or Miladin Bečanović, and chose to develop its youth academy. Yet another economic crisis brought the club to the brink of bankruptcy and led to relegation to the second division in 1997.

While being in Division 2, the club was privatised and purchased in 1999 by and Francis Graille. The team then trained by Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhodžić reconnected with success. Lille quickly recovered as Lille were head and shoulders over the other clubs during the 1999–2000 Division 2 season, the club dominated the championship thanks to excellent defense and finished champion with sixteen points ahead of its runner-up, being promoted back to the top.

===Back to the top and new double (2000–2017)===

In just its first season back in the top flight 2000–01 French Division 1, Lille qualified for Europe for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, booking its place in the 2001–02 Champions League. On the back of the club&#x27;s new status, Lille entered into a decisive new era under the guidance of chairman and chief executive officer Michel Seydoux and coach Claude Puel. The club left the historical Stade Grimonprez-Jooris to join the Stadium Lille Métropole and became a regular on the European scene. Amongst its most emphatic results was the 1–0 victory over Manchester United at the Stade de France in 2005, the 2–0 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1–0 home win over Liverpool in 2010.
In the 2010s, Lille knew a steady development on and off the pitch, and has established itself as one of the most important clubs in French Ligue 1. First, the inauguration of the vast and modern Domaine de Luchin training complex in 2007 brings the club to a new era, the center being one of the largest in France. Roughly at the same time, the construction of the 50,000-capacity Grand Stade Lille Métropole (renamed later Stade Pierre-Mauroy), which opened in 2012, began on 29 March 2010 and will give the club the fourth-largest football stadium in France. Successive strong results and a sporting progression under head coach Rudi Garcia took the club back to the top of the French league. Fifty-six years after the club&#x27;s last trophy, 2010–11 first-team, led by home-grown players Yohan Cabaye, Mathieu Debuchy and Eden Hazard, won the club&#x27;s second double after finishing at the 2010–11 Ligue 1 top spot and defeating Paris Saint-Germain in the 2011 Coupe de France final.

In the 2011–12 and 2012–13 Ligue 1 seasons, Lille confirmed its place belong top French football teams, finishing successively at the second and sixth places and qualifying for the 2012–13 Champions League. In 2013, Garcia left to join Roma, while former Montpellier coach René Girard was appointed as new manager. Under Girard, Lille finished at the third place in 2013–14, behind Zlatan Ibrahimović&#x27;s Paris Saint-Germain and James Rodríguez&#x27;s Monaco. After two years in charge of the club and a deceiving eight seed at the end of the 2014–15 Ligue 1 season, Girard left the club by mutual consent.

In May 2015, the Ivory Coast national team head coach Hervé Renard was appointed as the new manager. On 11 November 2015, Renard was terminated as manager and was replaced by Frederic Antonetti. On 23 November 2016, a year after being appointed, Lille terminated Antonetti&#x27;s contract with the club lying second last in the table.

===Campos and Galtier era: sustained success (2017–2021)===
In early 2017, Lille appointed Luís Campos as sporting director and head of recruitment. A short time afterwards, the club announced the arrival of Argentine famous manager Marcelo Bielsa. In November 2017, Bielsa was suspended by Lille following an unauthorized trip to Chile with the club lying second from bottom on the table again and only managing 3 wins from the first 14 games of the season. On 23 December 2017, Bielsa was terminated by Lille and replaced with former Saint-Etienne manager Christophe Galtier. In a difficult 2017–18 season, Lille managed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 by defeating Toulouse 3–2 in the second last game of the campaign.
Lille&#x27;s following season is completely different. After the arrivals of veterans José Fonte and Loïc Rémy, Turkish right-back Zeki Çelik and forwards Jonathan Bamba, Jonathan Ikoné and Rafael Leão, the team proceeded to reel off a string of victories, losing only five games in the first part of the 2018–19 Ligue 1 season. On 14 April 2019, before a record attendance of 49,712 spectators, they defeated Paris Saint-Germain in a historic and storming 5–1 home win with goals from Nicolas Pépé, Jonathan Bamba, Gabriel and team captain José Fonte. At the end of the season, Lille secured the second place to qualify for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage; they returned to the competition after a seven-year absence. On 1 August 2019, club&#x27;s season-top scorer Nicolas Pépé is sold to Premier League side Arsenal in a club-record fee of €80 million (£72 million). Lille announced the recruitment of Victor Osimhen and Tiago Djaló on the same day, after the signings of Timothy Weah, Reinildo Mandava and Benjamin André a few weeks earlier. The club then announced the arrivals of Yusuf Yazıcı and Renato Sanches to strengthen the midfield. In early March 2020, the Northmen were in 4th place with 49 points after 28 rounds. However, the Ligue 1 season ended abruptly as the LFP first suspended domestic leagues indefinitely following the outbreak of COVID-19 in France on 13 March, and then definitely cancelled French football competitions a month and a half later.

In the 2020 summer transfer window, Lille chose to sign young talents Sven Botman and Jonathan David as well as veteran Burak Yılmaz. At the end of the 2020–21 season first half, Lille had only lost two games and was well installed in the top league rankings, having defeated Derby du Nord rivals Lens in a 4–0 home win on 18 October 2020. The Mastiffs started the second part of the season with a six-game winning streak and lost only once until the end. On 3 April 2021, Lille won at Paris with a Jonathan David goal and took over sole possession of first place in the league. Three weeks later, Lille came back from two goals down to beat Lyon at Groupama Stadium as Burak Yılmaz scored twice including a 27-yard free kick in a breathtaking 3–2 away win. Lille then defeated local rivals once again, scoring three goals at Lens and prevailing in the season with an aggregate score of 7–0. On 23 May, Lille sealed the Ligue 1 title with a 2–1 victory at Angers after a dramatic Ligue 1 final round and won its fourth Ligue 1 title under the guidance of manager Christophe Galtier. At the end of the season, goalkeeper Mike Maignan finished the season with 21 clean sheets, one short of the league season all-time record. Competing also in the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, they defeated AC Milan at San Siro, on 5 November 2020, in a big 3–0 away win with a hat-trick from Yusuf Yazıcı, but lost to Ajax in round of 32.

===Further stages and European maturity (2021–present)===
In the 2021–22 season, Lille won its first Trophée des Champions, defeating Paris Saint-Germain with a Xeka goal at Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv, Israel on 1 August 2021. The Northmen then reached UEFA Champions League round of 16 and are defeated by Chelsea, after qualifying from the group stage against Salzburg, Sevilla and Wolfsburg. According to an analysis report published at the end of the Ligue 1 season, Lille is the fourth best French club in Ligue 1, in the 21st century, behind Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille.

On 29 June 2022, the club appointed Paulo Fonseca as new head coach of the first-team. The 2022–23 season started very well for the Northmen as they defeated Auxerre, on 7 August, in a 4–1 home win. On 9 October, they defeated close rivals Lens in a 1–0 home win. Being one of the best offensive teams in the league, Fonseca&#x27;s Lille is praised for its stylish, slick passing game and its attacking system. Since the beginning of the season, Lille have played in an open, offensive 4–2–3–1 formation with Benjamin André, André Gomes or Angel Gomes playing as central midfielders behind playmaker Rémy Cabella and lone striker Jonathan David. Following 4–3 home win over Monaco on 23 October, only Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain have had more possession in France in the 2022–23 Ligue 1 season.

==Identity and colours==
===Crest and nicknames===

Lille&#x27;s crest has changed many times. The first crest of the newborn club was simply the escutcheon of the city of Lille dating from 1235 that shows an argent-on-gules fleur-de-lys. The fleur-de-lys refers to the name and the insularity of the city. &quot;&quot;Lille&quot;, or &quot;Lile&quot; and &quot;Lysle&quot; depending on the past forms, is phonetically close to &quot;Lisle&quot;, an old spelling of &quot;Lys&quot;&quot;. The lys also makes reference to the water flag, which were rife through the marshes surrounding the city. The colours of the heraldry, argent (white) and gules (red), embody wisdom and wealth for the first one, and passion and faithfulness for the second.

White and red were the colours of Olympique Lillois while blue, traditional colour of the team shorts, refers to SC Fives and is also present in the first-ever club crest from 1946. Red remains the main colour used by the club in its imagery, on its website or its social media.

The club adopted the colours of his founding and merging parents, and the fleur-de-lys symbol that can be seen in the first badges. In 1981, the mastiff appeared for the first time in the club crest and has never left it. The nickname, &quot;Les Dogues&quot; (French for &quot;The Mastiffs&quot;), evokes and emphasizes the team&#x27;s aggressiveness and dedication, and was first used in the 1920s for Olympique Lillois players. This nickname seems to have appeared for the first time in the now-defunct newspaper &quot;Le Télégramme du Nord&quot; (French for &quot;The North Telegram&quot;) on 10 November 1919. Olympique Lillois started to officially use it in the club&#x27;s press releases a few weeks later. Other nicknames or designations are frequently used, like &quot;Les Nordistes&quot; (French for &quot;The Northmen&quot;) or &quot;Les Lillois&quot; (), the demonym corresponding to Lille.

In 1989, a new crest was unveiled which combines the fleur-de-lys and a mastiff that seems jumping out of the flower. The acronym &quot;&quot;LOSC&quot; is supplemented by the term &quot;Lille Métropole&quot;&quot; to enhance the Métropole Européenne de Lille size and importance in Western Europe. The club officials at that time wanted to entrench the club in its region, not only in the city but in a 1,000,000-inhabitants area where the club moved some facilities. This badge was marginally revised in 1997 but was replaced in 2002 with a more stylish one where the dog and the acronym are prominent. In 2012, the fleur-de-lys once again became a central element in the logo. The badge shape recalls the previous heraldry, and only the city and club name appear at the top of the logo like a crown.

The latest crest, which was unveiled in 2018, uses every club symbol (the club initials, the mastiff, the fleur-de-lys and the three colours) inside a regular pentagon shape, form of the Citadel of Lille&#x27;s heart.
;Notes
===Kits and sponsors===
Born from the union of two teams, Lille OSC embraced different shirts elements and symbols of both founding clubs. The first club&#x27;s home kit was white and blue. The white jersey, with a large red &quot;V&quot; or chevron form around the neck and red sleeve ends, is inspired by the Olympique Lillois home jersey while the &quot;V&quot; shape comes from SC Fives kits as well as the blue shorts and socks. White was the jersey primary color with little shades of red. The red chevron was part of each jersey until 1964 when it disappeared to give place to an immaculate white jersey that only kept red collar and sleeve ends. This jersey version, white with only few red shades around collar and sleeves, remains substantially the same for decades.

In the 1990s, the different kit manufacturers successively added different red shapes around shoulders like a red check pattern, a large Reebok logo that lines the top of the shirt or a plain red pattern enabling the presence of a white chevron with red borders. The 1992-93 season marked the quick return of the red chevron. 1999 marked a significant moment in LOSC kits history. At the beginning of this season, the club chose to switch the principal colour of the kits. Home jerseys are now dominated by red, while away ones are white overall. The club exceptionally returns to a white home kit for the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season in order to celebrate the league and cup double 70-year anniversary.

Third kits are traditionally used for European games. Being initially blue in the early 2000s, third kits then used and incorporated flag of Flanders colours: black and yellow. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the club released more than a dozen black or yellow third kits.

Lille have known many sporting goods manufacturers in its history. From its creation until the 1970s, Lille didn&#x27;t have a proper kit supplier. The first club&#x27;s kit manufacturer was Le Coq Sportif which made Lille&#x27;s first branded jerseys until 1975. In the 1980s, the club&#x27;s supplier was Puma, one of the famous Lille&#x27;s kit maker. Puma&#x27;s sponsorship lasted for nine years, and the German brand shirts remain engraved in people&#x27;s memories. After this period, many suppliers have come and gone including Lotto and Adidas for brief contracts. Reebok received the contract in 1996, stayed three seasons, before Nike started a first spell in 1999. Decathlon&#x27;s football brand Kipsta, which is based in Lille region, Airness and Canterbury, the rugby-specialized company, followed. In 2013, Umbro took over until Nike started a second spell in 2013 that lasted three years.
On 22 June 2016, Lille announced a five-year partnership with New Balance, becoming one of the biggest football teams that have signed with the Boston-based sportswear manufacturer. Partnership is renewed in 2021 on a new five-season contract until June 2026.

The first main sponsors of the club were that appeared two seasons in the front of the jersey, and Lille-made Pel d&#x27;Or lemonade, produced by the very famous Pelforth brewery. One of the most iconic Lille sponsors is French nappy and baby products manufacturer that lasted more than ten years. Production factories were located in Linselles, in the Lille region and the nine red letters are now part of the identity of the club. However, Peaudouce was acquired by Sweden consumer products company SCA which decided to end the sponsorship. Foodservice company Eurest, banks Crédit Agricole and ING Direct are famous main sponsors too, that lasted at least two seasons.

Subsequently, the famous &quot;P&quot; of French casino and resort company appeared on Lille&#x27;s jersey in 2003 for the first time. Based in the north of France, Partouche is Lille&#x27;s most loyal sponsor: the brand logo was on the club&#x27;s shirt during fourteen seasons. The most recent main sponsors are French consumer electronics retailer and British online car retailer Cazoo.

===Stadiums===
After its foundation following the merging of Olympique Lillois and SC Fives, Lille alternately played its home games at the stadiums of both clubs: Stade Henri-Jooris of Olympique Lillois and Stade Jules-Lemaire of SC Fives. However, in 1949, the club chose to keep the first as his home ground and to use the second as a training ground. Becoming more and more obsolete, Stade Jules-Lemaire was destroyed ten years later, in 1959. Named after Henri Jooris, the iconic president of Olympique Lillois, the 15,000-seat stadium, located by the Deûle river, near the Citadel of Lille, was the home of Les Dogues until 1975 when Lille moved at Stade Grimonprez-Jooris.

Located inside the citadel park, not far from the former venue, the stadium&#x27;s original capacity was 25,000 at the time it was opened, but this was reduced to around 17,000 by 2000 due to the evolution of safety standards. In 2000, the stadium was renovated and its capacity was increased to 21,000. However, it still failed to meet FIFA licensing regulations and plans to build a new stadium compliant with UEFA&#x27;s standards were made in 2002, when the club was privatized.
In June 2003, the club&#x27;s board agreed to a new proposal put forward by the city mayor to build a new 33,000-seat stadium on the site of the Stade Grimonprez-Jooris. Preliminary works which included dismantling of training grounds were undertaken, and the delivery was scheduled for 31 December 2004 but was postponed. Construction work was then planned to begin in early 2005, but the project faced opposition from preservationists who successfully prevented the project to obtain necessary permits as the site of the stadium was close to the 17th-century citadel.

In May 2004, the stadium closed its doors and the delays forced Lille to play its league matches at Stadium Nord Lille Métropole, a 18,000-seat stadium in Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq, and their 2005–06 UEFA Champions League games at Stade de France in the Paris region. After two years of court battles, local courts had declared issued building permits void in July and December 2005, which meant that &quot;Grimonprez-Jooris II&quot; would never come into existence. Grimonprez-Jooris was demolished in 2010, six years after Lille OSC&#x27;s departure. The club stayed at Stadium Lille Métropole until the end of the 2011-12 Ligue 1 season. While LOSC was struggling with its venue problems, the administrative landscape of the Lille area changed. The new administration, now in charge of the whole area, decided to launch a new stadium project.
On 1 February 2008, Eiffage was selected during a general meeting to build a 50,000-seat capacity multi-purpose stadium with a retractable roof. The stadium has also a particularity: it can become a fully functional arena of 30,000 seats that can host basketball, tennis or handball games as well as concerts. Stade Pierre-Mauroy, known for sponsorship reasons as Decathlon Arena – Stade Pierre-Mauroy since 2022, was inaugurated on 17 August 2012. Originally named the &quot;Grand Stade Lille Métropole&quot;, the stadium was renamed in 2013 in honor of the former Mayor of Lille and former Prime Minister of France Pierre Mauroy. The stadium venue is located in Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq and has a seating capacity of 50,186 people, becoming France&#x27;s fourth largest stadium.

The stadium hosted France national football team and France national rugby union team as well as some games of UEFA Euro 2016 and many Top 14 matches. It has been chosen to be one of the nine venues selected for France&#x27;s hosting of the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The 30,000-seat arena hosted EuroBasket 2015, Davis Cup, 2017 World Men&#x27;s Handball Championship and was also chosen to host handball and basketball tournaments at the 2024 Olympic Games.

The record attendance for a sports game stands at 49,712 spectators, who witnessed Lille&#x27;s 5–1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in 2019.

===Training facilities===
Located in Camphin-en-Pévèle, 15 minutes away from central Lille, the Domaine de Luchin has been the club&#x27;s training ground since 2007. A 43-hectare estate, it houses nine full-size pitches (including one artificial turf pitch), one goalkeepers training field, the club headquarters, the academy facility, classrooms and bedrooms as well as a medical pole, a fitness centre, press areas and the famous &quot;Dogue de Bronze&quot; (French for &quot;The Bronze Mastiff&quot;), a bronze statue of a mastiff which has been installed in 2011 and appeared in many pictures and videos of the club. The main pitch is a stadium of 1,000 spectators, including 500 seats, that can host matches for the academy and women&#x27;s teams. In March 2024, Lille OSC chose to rename this pitch after club legend Eden Hazard. The &quot;Terrain Eden Hazard&quot; (French for &quot;Eden Hazard pitch&quot;) was inaugurated by the former Belgium captain in the company of his loved ones, ex-teammates, academy players and supporters groups.

A segment of the Berlin Wall, with a graffiti of Hazard by French artist C215 painted on it, has been unveiled in 2016 and is on display inside the centre.

==Club rivalries==
The &quot;Derby du Nord&quot; (French for &quot;The North Derby&quot;) is contested between Lille and RC Lens. The derby name refers only to their geographical location in France; both clubs and cities only being located in the northern part of France, within the Hauts-de-France region but not the same department. Being the fourth-largest city of the Pas-de-Calais department, Lens is located 30 kilometres south of regional prefecture and nerve centre Lille, Nord department main city. The name can also refer to matches involving Lille and Valenciennes as both clubs are located within Nord, however, the match historically refers to matches involving Lille and Lens. As a result, the Lille–Valenciennes match is sometimes referred to as &quot;Le Petit Derby du Nord&quot; (French for &quot;The Little North Derby&quot;).

The two clubs first met in 1937 when Lille were playing under the Olympique Lillois emblem. Due to each club&#x27;s close proximity towards each other being separated by only and sociological differences between each club&#x27;s supporters, a fierce rivalry developed. The North Derby is underpinned by social and economic differences, since the city of Lens is known as a working-class and industrial mining city whereas Lille as a middle-class, modern, internationally oriented cultural metropolis. This social class opposition is no longer relevant: both fanbases now come from lower and middle classes.

As of 2024, the teams have played more than 115 matches in all competitions, Lille winning 46, Lens 37, and the remaining 36 having been drawn. Lille have won the most top division titles, the most Coupe de France trophies and Trophée des Champions titles. The Mastiffs have also played more games in domestic and European top competitions and have more game wins in French top division than their nearby rivals.

<text>The Third Battle of the Dardanelles in the Fifth Ottoman-Venetian War took place on 26 and 27 June 1656 inside the Dardanelles Strait. The battle was a clear victory for Venice and the Knights Hospitaller over the Ottoman Empire, although their commander, Lorenzo Marcello, was killed on the first day.

== Background ==
Since 1645, Venice and the Ottoman Empire had been at war over the possession of the island of Crete. Ottoman forces had captured most of the island in the early years of the war, but were unable to seize its capital, the heavily fortified city of Candia (modern Heraklion). The Venetians had endeavoured to cut off supplies and reinforcements to the Ottoman army, and attempted several times to blockade the Straits of the Dardanelles, through which the Ottoman fleet had to sail to reach the Aegean Sea from its base around Constantinople.

== Preface ==
Marcello reached the island of Imbros, outside the Dardanelles Strait, on 23 May 1656 with 13 sailing ships, 6 galleasses and 24 galleys as well as some more vessels under Pietro Bembo. On 11 June, 7 Maltese galleys under Gregorio Carafa arrived, making a total of 29 sailing ships, 7 galleasses and 31 galleys.

On 23 June the Ottomans, under Kenan or Chinam Pasha, a Russian convert, appeared in the Strait with 28 sailing ships, 9 galleasses and 61 galleys. On 24 June Ottoman land batteries on either side of the Straits tried to drive the Venetians off but failed.

== Battle ==
In the morning of 26 June the wind was from the north, and the Ottomans made good progress, the Venetian galleys being unable to assist their sailing ships. Then the wind backed, turning to the SE, trapping the Ottomans against the Asian side of the Strait just below the Narrows, and a mêlée ensued. Kenan Pasha got back past the Narrows with 14 galleys but the rest were either captured, sunk or burnt. &quot;Sultan&quot;/&quot;San Marco&quot; was the most advanced Venetian ship and did the most to prevent the Ottoman retreat, but she ran aground under the Ottoman guns and was abandoned.

During the course of the battle, the Venetian Captain General Marcello was killed by a direct cannon hit, but his death kept a secret from all but his second, the &quot;provedditore&quot; of the fleet Barbaro Badoer.

Some small-scale fighting happened the next day, and at the end of it, the Ottoman fleet had lost 4 large sailing ships, 2 pinks, 5 galleasses and 13 galleys captured, and 22 sailing ships, 4 galleasses and 34 galleys sunk or burnt. Only 2 Ottoman sailing ships and 14 galleys escaped. Of the captured ships, Malta received 2 galleasses, 8 galleys and 1 &quot;super galley&quot; (or galleass?). The Venetians lost 3 sailing ships burnt and their casualties were 207 killed, 260 wounded and 94 missing. Maltese casualties were 40 killed and 100 or more wounded. Some 5,000 Christian slaves employed in the Ottoman fleet were freed.

== Aftermath ==
It was the heaviest naval defeat the Ottomans had suffered since the Battle of Lepanto, and enabled the Venetians to occupy the strategically important islands of Tenedos and Lemnos, thus establishing a tight blockade of the Straits. As a result, the resupply of Crete was effectively cut off, and Constantinople itself suffered a shortage of food during the winter. In a three-day battle in July 1657, however, the blockade would be broken again.

<text>The Wild Thornberrys Movie (or just The Wild Thornberrys) is a 2002 American animated adventure film based on the television series of the same name. It was produced by Klasky Csupo and distributed by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. Directed by Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, the film follows the show&#x27;s protagonist, Eliza Thornberry as she goes on a quest to save a cheetah cub from ruthless poachers. The film was released on December 20, 2002, to mostly positive reviews and grossed more than $60 million worldwide. It is the first installment in &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; film series.

The film was nominated for Best Original Song at the 75th Academy Awards for Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;, making it the first film based on a Nickelodeon series to receive an Academy Award nomination. A sequel to the film, as well as a crossover with characters from &quot;Rugrats&quot; titled &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, was released on June 13, 2003.

==Plot==

Eliza Thornberry plays with a family of cheetahs in East Africa&#x27;s Kenya after being left in charge of the cubs by their mother, Akela. When Eliza strays far from the cheetahs&#x27; home, one of the cheetah cubs, Tally, is kidnapped by poachers. Eliza is determined to save the cub, which prompts her grandmother Cordelia to bring her to a boarding school in London for her safety. Upon arriving, Eliza discovers that her pet chimpanzee, Darwin, stowed away in her suitcase. He attempts to blend in but gets both him and Eliza in trouble.

After having a dream in which Shaman Mnyambo tells her to save Tally, Eliza and Darwin return to Africa. While taking a train from Nairobi, they encounter an injured male rhinoceros, who was shot at the river by the same poachers who kidnapped Tally. They save the rhino with the help of veterinarians Bree and Sloan Blackburn. Meanwhile, Eliza&#x27;s older sister Debbie is left alone with her feral adoptive younger brother Donnie at their RV, the Comvee, while their parents, Nigel and Marianne, go to film a solar eclipse at Tempo Valley. Eliza returns to the Comvee for supplies; after a small confrontation, Debbie pursues her, Darwin, and Donnie. Cordelia and her husband, Colonel Radcliffe, meet up with Nigel and Marianne to inform them of Eliza&#x27;s escape, and they also begin searching for Eliza.

Darwin, Eliza, and Donnie meet a gorilla who mentions seeing people setting up a fence across Tempo Valley. Then, they run into the Blackburns again. Eliza concludes that the poachers are targeting the elephant herd traveling through the valley. Later, the trio finds Tally in the Blackburns&#x27; RV, exposing their true nature as the poachers. The Blackburns capture them and reveal the fence is electrified. Meanwhile, Debbie meets a local Mbuti boy named Boko, who is sent by his village elders to assist her. The two reach the Blackburns&#x27; RV, but Sloan holds Debbie hostage after she reveals she is Eliza&#x27;s sister. When Sloan threatens to kill Debbie if Eliza doesn&#x27;t tell him how she found out their idea, Eliza admits it was because of her ability to talk to animals. A storm arrives and takes away Eliza&#x27;s powers while the Blackburns flee. 

They reach Tempo Valley in time to see the elephant herd heading for the electric fence. When Eliza becomes doubtful of herself, Debbie reminds her that she has been helping animals long before gaining her powers, restoring her confidence. The Blackburns, riding a helicopter, order their men to set off explosives, scaring the elephants and making them charge toward the fence. Eliza triggers the fence&#x27;s electricity prematurely, causing the herd to stop temporarily, and then convinces the lead elephant to turn around. Infuriated by this, Sloan throws Eliza into a river. He then attempts to shoot the elephants, but they pull the Blackburns&#x27; helicopter out of the air by its rope ladder and destroy it, causing him and Bree to fall. They survive the fall but are arrested by rangers soon after as the eclipse ends. Eliza nearly drowns until she is saved by Shaman Mnyambo, who tells her she saved the elephants using her heart instead of her powers. As a reward, he gives her back her powers. 

Eliza reunites with her family, who decide not to send her back to boarding school, while Boko returns to his village, keeping Debbie&#x27;s watch as a memento. The Thornberrys return to the Savannah, where Eliza reunites Tally with his family. Debbie is angered when Eliza tells her that she will turn into a baboon if she reveals her secret, and in the process frightens a group of baboons Nigel and Marianne are filming. One of them activates the radio, which plays music that the Thornberrys and the baboons dance to.

<doc id="990769" wikidata="Q153535" url="?curid=990769" title="Alemannia Aachen">
<text>Alemannia Aachen () or ATSV Alemannia 1900 is a German football club from the western city of Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia. A long term fixture of the country&#x27;s second division, &quot;Alemannia&quot; enjoyed a three-year turn in the Bundesliga in the late 1960s and, after a successful 2005–06 campaign, returned to the first division for a single season. The club has since slipped to third division play and in late 2012 entered into bankruptcy. They finished their 2012–13 3. Liga schedule before resuming play in the tier IV Regionalliga West in 2013–14.

In the 2023–24 Regionalliga, Alemannia finished 1st in the West Group, which got them immediately promoted to the 2024–25 3. Liga.

Alemannia carries the nickname &quot;the potato beetles&quot; (Kartoffelkäfer) because of their striped yellow-black jerseys, which make them look like the particular insects. The home of Alemannia is New Tivoli.

==History==
===Foundation to World War II===
In the second half of the 19th century, resident English workers and businessmen brought football, in addition to the traditional equestrian sports, into the western Rhineland. The club was founded on 16 December 1900 by a group of eighteen high school students. Knowing that another team had already taken the name 1. FC Aachen, the new club was christened FC Alemannia, using the Latin word for Germany (see Alamannia). The First World War devastated the club: the pre-war membership of 200 was reduced to a mere 37 by the conflict. In early 1919 Alemannia merged with local sports club Aachener Turnverein 1847 to become TSV Alemannia Aachen 1900. Their new partner&#x27;s interest was primarily in gymnastics rather than football and as a result the union was short-lived, with the clubs splitting again in 1924.

The city of Aachen is very near the Belgian and Dutch borders and as a result Alemannia has had frequent contact with clubs from those countries. Their first game was against the Belgian side R. Dolhain F.C., one of that country&#x27;s earliest clubs. There are intensive and friendly contacts with the Dutch professional club Roda JC Kerkrade. Both clubs have the same club colors.

The team played in the Rhineland-Westphalia FA and won its first championship there in 1907, before joining the newly formed Westdeutsche Fussball Verband in 1909. The club grew steadily as interest in football increased. They qualified for the Rheingauliga in 1921, built their own stadium in 1928, and earned admittance to the Oberliga the following year.

The club enjoyed some success in the early 1930s by advancing to the final four of the Westdeutsche championship playoffs. In 1933, German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight Gauligen. Alemannia played several seasons in the Gauliga Mittelrhein in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They finished top in their division in 1938 and advanced to the national final rounds. This was in spite of a protest by SV Beuel 06 which ultimately saw that club awarded the division championship, but too late to allow Beuel to play in the national playoff in Aachen&#x27;s stead.

Alemannia is known as one of the few sports clubs of this era to offer any challenge to the Nazi regime&#x27;s purge of Jews from the country&#x27;s sports organizations by demanding the release of a jailed Jewish member.

===Postwar and entry to the Bundesliga===
In 1946, after World War II and the lifting of the ban placed by Allied occupation authorities on most types of organizations in Germany, &quot;Alemannia&quot; re-constituted itself and began play in second tier Rheinbezirk. They returned to first division play in the Oberliga West the next year, but ran into financial difficulty. They remained a steady, but unspectacular second division side, generally finishing mid-table.

Aachen&#x27;s first measure of success came with an advance to the DFB-Pokal final in 1953 where they lost a 1–2 decision to Rot-Weiss Essen.

After the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league, in 1963, Alemannia found themselves in Regionalliga West (II). In 1965, they had another good run in German Cup competition, earning another final appearance – but were once again unsuccessful – this time losing 0–2 to Borussia Dortmund.

The club captured their division in 1967 and were promoted to the Bundesliga (I) for the 1967–68 season. They enjoyed their best ever result the next year with a second-place finish behind champion Bayern Munich. However, the following season was a disaster: the team earned only one point in play away from home and toppled to an 18th-place finish. They returned to play in the Regionalliga West (II), and in 1990 fell still further to the third division.

===Road to recovery===
After several mediocre seasons in the second half of the 1990s, trainer Werner Fuchs rejuvenated the Alemannia squad by playing 4–4–2 without a libero (sweeper), creating a side that played an attractive, fluid offense. In 1999, the team played well and delivered an especially strong second half. They were atop the table, just weeks away from the end of the season, when tragedy struck with the unexpected death of Fuchs. The whole city was in shock, but the club managed to pull through, dedicating their promotion to their late trainer and winning the Regionalliga West/Südwest (III). The first years in the 2. Bundesliga were tough for Aachen, both on the field and financially. The club struggled for several seasons and the situation was worsened when financial irregularities were uncovered showing the club was near bankruptcy.

The turnaround came with a new executive board under president Horst Heinrichs, trainer Dieter Hecking and manager Jörg Schmadtke. Through improved financial management, shrewd player signings, and clever game tactics, &quot;Aachen&quot; became a power once again in the 2003–04 season. They played their way to their third DFB-Pokal final appearance, knocking off TSV 1860 Munich, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Mönchengladbach, before losing 2–3 to Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen. As league champions Bremen already held a place in the UEFA Champions League, thereby making room for Aachen to take part in the UEFA Cup competition. They delivered a decent performance, advancing to the Round of 32 before going out to eventual semi-finalists AZ Alkmaar. The club&#x27;s participation in the German Cup and UEFA Cup play helped to significantly improve their financial situation.

===Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga===
On 16 April 2006, Alemannia became the first team to earn promotion to the Bundesliga in 2005–06, ending Aachen&#x27;s 36-year absence from top-flight football. However, they stayed up only a single season as they took only one point from their last eight matches of the campaign. In the middle of 2007, the club appointed former German international defender and 1990 FIFA World Champion Guido Buchwald as manager trainer, who was fired after only 14 matches. After a short interim with Alemannia&#x27;s Sportsmanger Jörg Schmadtke as headcoach, he was then replaced by Jürgen Seeberger, hardly known in Germany, in the winter break of the season.

The club suffered a rapid decline after its single Bundesliga season, being relegated from the 2. Bundesliga in 2012 and from the 3. Liga the 2013 season. Alemannia returned to 3. Liga in 2024.

===Coaching history===
==Stadium==

Alemannia Aachen used to play at the Old Tivoli which had a capacity of 21,632 spectators (3,632 seats). One of Germany&#x27;s better known stadiums, it was built in 1928 and was renovated several times. The club played its 2004 UEFA Cup matches, however, in Cologne&#x27;s RheinEnergieStadion in order to meet the stadium capacity requirements in place for the competition.

In August 2009, Aachen opened a new stadium, the New Tivoli, which has a capacity of 32,960 spectators (11,681 in standing areas).
==Basketball ==
Alemania Aachen also had a successful basketball department reaching the German Championship final twice in 1959 and 1962. The team eventually won the title two consecutive seasons (1963 and 1964). The finals are listed below:

<text>Nancy Kwan Ka-shen (; born May 19, 1939) is a Chinese-American actress. In addition to her personality and looks, her career benefited from Hollywood&#x27;s casting of more Asian roles in the 1960s, especially in comedies. She was considered an Eastern sex symbol in the 1960s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Hong Kong on May 19, 1939, and growing up in Kowloon Tong, Kwan is the Eurasian daughter of Kwan Wing-hong, a Cantonese architect and Marquita Scott, a European model of English and Scottish ancestry. Kwan Wing-hong was the son of lawyer Kwan King-sun and Juliann Loke Yuen-ying, daughter of Loke Yew. He attended Cambridge University and met Scott in London. The two married and moved to Hong Kong, where Wing-hong became an eminent architect. In that era, interracial marriage was not universally accepted. Nancy has an older brother, Ka-keung.

In 1941, Kwan&#x27;s parents divorced when she was two years old. Scott escaped to England and never rejoined the family. Her mother later moved to New York and married an American. 

At Christmas 1941, in fear of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong during World War II, Wing Hong, in the guise of a coolie, escaped from Hong Kong to North China with his two children, whom he hid in wicker baskets. Kwan and her brother were transported by servants, evading Japanese sentries. They remained in exile in western China for five years until the war ended, after which they returned to Hong Kong and lived in a spacious, contemporary home her father designed. Remaining in Hong Kong with the children, her father married a Chinese woman, whom Kwan called &quot;Mother&quot;. Her father and her stepmother raised her, in addition to her brother and five half-brothers and half-sisters. Five of Kwan&#x27;s siblings became lawyers.

All of my brothers and sisters are lawyers. The whole family. So I’m the black sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;sL/NK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; – Nancy Kwan

Except during World War II, Kwan had a comfortable early life. Cared for by an &quot;amah&quot; (阿嬤), a woman who looks after children, Kwan owned a pony and passed her summers in resorts in Borneo, Macao, and Japan. An affluent man, her father owned a several-acre hilltop property in Kowloon. In her youth, she was called &quot;Ka-shen&quot;. She wrote in 1960 that as an eight-year-old, her fortune-teller &quot;predicted travel, fame, and fortune for me&quot;.

Kwan attended the Catholic Maryknoll Convent School until she was 13 years old, after which she travelled to Kingsmoor School in Glossop, England a private boarding school that had offered places to refugees in 1938 and 1939,&lt;ref name=&quot;bw/mup/refugees&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; either at no cost or at a reduced rate, that her brother Ka-keung was then attending. Her brother studied to become an architect and she studied to become a dancer.

Kwan&#x27;s introduction to &quot;tai chi&quot; sparked a desire to learn ballet. When Kwan was 18, she pursued her dream of becoming a ballet dancer by attending the Royal Ballet School in London. She studied performing arts subjects such as stage make-up and danced every day for four hours. Her studies at the Royal Ballet School ran concurrently with her high-school studies. Because Kwan&#x27;s high school had deep connections with nearby theatre companies, Kwan was able to perform small parts in several of their productions. Upon graduating from high school, she sojourned in France, Italy, and Switzerland on a luxury trip. Afterwards, she travelled back to Hong Kong, where she started a ballet school.

=== Early career ===
Stage producer Ray Stark posted an advertisement in the &quot;Hong Kong Tiger Standard&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Standard&quot;) regarding auditions for the character Suzie Wong for a play. The ad asked applicants to present their pictures, résumés, and proportions. Kwan submitted the application and was discovered by Stark in a film studio constructed by her architect father. After auditioning for Stark, she was asked to screen test to play a character in the prospective film &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;. Stark preferred Kwan over the other women because she &quot;would have more universal acceptance&quot;. Another auditionee, French actress France Nuyen, played the stage version of the role and had been called a &quot;businessman&#x27;s delight&quot; by a number of reviewers. Stark disliked this characterization, as well as &quot;happy harlot&quot; characters such as Melina Mercouri in &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;. Stark wanted an Asian actress because reconfiguring the eyes of a white actress would merely look artificial. He also praised Kwan&#x27;s features: an &quot;acceptable face&quot; and &quot;being alluringly leggy [and] perfectly formed&quot;.

For each screen test, Kwan, accompanied by her younger sister, was chauffeured to the studio by her father&#x27;s driver. Stark characterized Kwan&#x27;s first screen test as &quot;pretty dreadful&quot; but one that hinted at her potential. After four weeks of training with drama teachers, including hours of lessons with Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright–screenwriter John Patrick, Kwan&#x27;s second screen test was a significant improvement. 

Although she had not yet become an actress, Stark said, there was a &quot;development of her authority&quot;. Once, upon viewing her screen test, Kwan said, &quot;I&#x27;m a terrible girl&quot; and &quot;squealed with embarrassment&quot;; acting as a prostitute was a vastly different experience from her comfortable life with her affluent father. The reaction prompted Stark to refrain from letting her view the dailies. Kwan did a third screen test after four months had passed, and a deadlock existed between whether to choose Kwan or Nuyen.

Owing to Kwan&#x27;s lack of acting experience, at Stark&#x27;s request she travelled to the United States, where she attended acting school in Hollywood and resided in the Hollywood Studio Club, a chaperoned dormitory with other junior actresses. She later moved to New York. Kwan signed a seven-year contract with Stark&#x27;s Seven Arts Productions at a beginning salary of $300 a week, even though she was not given a distinct role. In 2005, Edward S. Feldman and Tom Barton characterized Kwan&#x27;s wages and her employment as &quot;indentured servitude&quot;. In a retrospective interview, Kwan told Goldsea that she had no prior acting experience and that the $300 a week salary was &quot;a lot of money to me then&quot;.

When &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; began to tour, Kwan was assigned the part of a bargirl. In addition to her small supporting character role, Kwan became an understudy for the production&#x27;s female lead, France Nuyen. Though Stark and the male lead William Holden preferred Kwan despite her somewhat apprehensive demeanor during the screen test, she did not get the role. Paramount favored the eminent France Nuyen, who had been widely praised for her performance in the film &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958). Stark acquiesced to Paramount&#x27;s wishes. Nuyen received the role and Kwan later took the place of Nuyen on Broadway. In a September 1960 interview with Associated Press journalist Bob Thomas, she said, &quot;I was bitterly disappointed, and I almost quit and went home when I didn&#x27;t get the picture.&quot; Kwan did not receive the lead role because Stark believed she was too inexperienced at the time. Nuyen won the title role in the upcoming movie because of her powerful portrayal of Suzie Wong during the tour. She moved to England to film the movie, leaving an opening for Kwan to ascend to the lead female role in the touring production. In 1959, one month after Nuyen was selected for the film role and while Kwan was touring in Toronto, Stark told her to screen test again for the film. Kwan responded to his phone call from London, asking, &quot;How can I come? I&#x27;m in this show.&quot; To provide a pretext for Kwan&#x27;s sudden hiatus from the touring production, Stark sent a cablegram to her superiors saying her father had become ill and had been hospitalized. Kwan later recalled in an interview about three years later, &quot;So I went to the manager and told him a lie. It was not very nice, but what could I do?&quot; After Kwan accepted the role, the Broadway play producer sued her for leaving with little notice.

Nuyen, who was in an unstable relationship with Marlon Brando, had a nervous breakdown and was fired from the role because of her erratic actions. The film&#x27;s director, Jean Negulesco, was fired and replaced by Richard Quine. Kwan, who previously had never been in a film, defeated 30 competitors from Hollywood, France, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. On February 15, 1960, she began filming the movie in London with co-star William Holden. 

During the filming, Kwan&#x27;s only trouble was a lingerie scene. Robert Lomax, as played by Holden, tears off her Western dress and says, &quot;Wear your own kind of clothing! Don&#x27;t try to copy some European girl!&quot; Director Richard Quine was displeased with Kwan&#x27;s underclothes: She wore a full-slip rather than a half-slip and bra. Finding the attire too modest and unrealistic, he asked Stark to talk to Kwan. Stark discovered Kwan taking refuge in her dressing room, sobbing grievously. He warned her, &quot;Nancy, wear the half-slip and bra or you&#x27;re off the picture. France Nuyen is no longer in it, remember? If you&#x27;re difficult you&#x27;ll be off it too. All we want to do is make you the best actress possible.&quot; Kwan returned to the set after lunch, aloofly wearing a bra and half-slip, acting as if what had happened earlier had not transpired.

Owing to Kwan&#x27;s perceptible Eurasian appearance, the film&#x27;s make-up artists endeavored to make her look more Chinese. They plucked her eyebrows and sketched a line across her forehead. In movies where Kwan plays Asian roles, the makeup artists reshape her brown eyes. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper wrote that Kwan, as a Eurasian, does not look fully Asian or European. Hopper wrote that the &quot;scattering of freckles across her tip-tilted nose give her an Occidental flavor&quot;. The production spanned five months, an unusually lengthy period for the era.

===Stardom===

&quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; was a &quot;box-office sensation&quot;. Critics lavished praise on Kwan for her performance. She was given the nickname &quot;Chinese Bardot&quot; for her unforgettable dance performance. Kwan and two other actresses, Ina Balin and Hayley Mills, were awarded the Golden Globe for the &quot;Most Promising Newcomer–Female&quot; in 1960. The following year, she was voted a &quot;Star of Tomorrow&quot;. Scholar Jennifer Leah Chan of New York University wrote that &quot;Suzie&quot; provided an Asian actress—Kwan—with the most significant Hollywood role since actress Anna May Wong&#x27;s success in the 1920s.

Following &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, Kwan was unprepared for fame. While she was purchasing fabric in a store on Nathan Road, she found people staring at her from the window. Wondering what they were staring at, it suddenly struck her that she was the point of attraction. Kwan remarked that in Beverly Hills, she can walk without attracting notice. She rationalized, &quot;[It] is better in America because America is much bigger, I guess&quot;. When people addressed her father after watching the film, they frequently called him &quot;Mr. Wong&quot;, a name that severely displeased him. Kwan said in a 1994 interview with the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; that even decades after her film debut and despite her having done over 50 films thence, viewers continued to send numerous letters to her about the film.

The scene of Kwan, reposed on a davenport and adorned in a dazzling &quot;cheongsam&quot;, while showing a &quot;deliciously decadent flash of thigh&quot;, became an iconic image. Clad in a cheongsam—&quot;a Chinese dress with a high collar and slits, one on each side of the skirt&quot;—Kwan was on the October 1960 cover of &quot;Life&quot;, cementing her status as an eminent sex symbol in the 1960s. Nicknamed the &quot;Suzie Wong dress&quot;, the cheongsam in the portrait spawned thousands of copycat promotional projects. In a 1962 interview, Kwan said she &quot;loved&quot; the &quot;cheongsam&quot;, calling it a &quot;national costume&quot;. She explained that it &quot;has slits because Chinese girls have pretty legs&quot; and &quot;the slits show their legs&quot;.
Chinese and Chinese-Americans became aggrieved after seeing how Chinese women were depicted as promiscuous. Tom Lisanti and Louis Paul speculated that the wave of unfavorable media attention drove filmmakers to escalate the production of Kwan&#x27;s next film. In 1961, she starred in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; in a related role. The film was distinguished for being the &quot;first big-budget American film&quot; with an all-Asian cast. Kwan did not sing the songs in the musical film; the vocals for Linda Low were performed by B. J. Baker. Comparing &quot;Suzie Wong&quot; and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, she found the latter much harder because the girl she played was &quot;more go-getter&quot;. Her prior ballet education provided a strong foundation for her role in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, where she had much space to dance.

After starring in &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, Kwan experienced a meteoric rise to celebrity. Scholar Jennifer Leah Chan of New York University chronicled the media attention Kwan received after starring in two Hollywood films, writing that Kwan&#x27;s fame peaked in 1962. In addition to being featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Kwan was the subject of a 1962 article in a popular women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, entitled &quot;The China Doll that Men Like&quot;.

As a Hollywood icon, Kwan lived in a house atop Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles. She commuted in a white British sports car and danced to Latin verses. She enjoyed listening to Johnny Mathis records and reading Chinese history texts. In 1962 (when she was 22), Kwan was dating Swiss actor Maximilian Schell. In an interview that year, she said she did not intend to get married until she was older, perhaps 24 or 25. She said a number of Americans married just to leave home or to &quot;make love&quot;. Kwan said this was problematic because she found dialogue and an ability to appreciate and express humor important in a marriage: &quot;You can&#x27;t just sit around and stare at walls between love-making.&quot;

In 1961, Kwan offered to work as a teacher for King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. The infantry was training for military involvement in Malaya (now part of Malaysia), and the regiment&#x27;s commanders believed that the infantrymen should be taught the Chinese language and how to handle chopsticks. Captain Anthony Hare announced to the public that the infantry needed a teacher – an attractive one. He later acknowledged that he appended the teacher &quot;must be attractive&quot; so that more soldiers would attend the sessions. Kwan, in Hollywood at the time, replied via cable: &quot;Please consider me a candidate as Chinese teacher for Yorkshire Light Infantry. I am fluent in Chinese, fabulous with chopsticks, and fond of uniforms.&quot; Captain Hare commented, &quot;Miss Kwan is too beautiful. I think she would be too much of a distraction.&quot; Her tardy request was not evaluated, as the infantry had already accepted the application of another Chinese woman.

===The Nancy Kwan Cut===
In 1963, Nancy Kwan&#x27;s long hair, famous from &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, was chopped into a sharp modernist bob by Vidal Sassoon for the film &quot;The Wild Affair&quot;, at the request of director John Krish. Designed by London hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, Kwan&#x27;s bob cut in the film drew widespread media attention for the &quot;severe geometry of her new hairstyle&quot;. Sassoon&#x27;s signature cut of Kwan&#x27;s hair was nicknamed &quot;the Kwan cut&quot;, &quot;the Kwan bob&quot;, or was plainly known as &quot;the Kwan&quot;; photographs of Kwan&#x27;s new hairstyle appeared in both the American and British editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Kwan&#x27;s success in her early career was not mirrored in later years, due to the cultural nature of 1960s America. Ann Lloyd and Graham Fuller wrote in their book &quot;The Illustrated Who&#x27;s Who of the Cinema&quot;: &quot;Her Eurasian beauty and impish sense of humor could not sustain her stardom&quot;. Her later films were marked by multifarious parts, comprising movie and television roles for American and European productions. Kwan discovered that she had to journey to Europe and Hong Kong to escape the ethnic typecasting in Hollywood that confined her largely to Asian roles in spite of her Eurasian appearance.

Her third movie was the British drama film &quot;The Main Attraction&quot; (1962) with Pat Boone. She played an Italian circus performer who was the love interest of Boone&#x27;s character. While she was filming the movie in the Austrian Alps, she met Peter Pock, a hotelier and ski teacher, with whom she immediately fell in love. She reflected, &quot;The first time I saw that marvelous-looking man I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s for me.&#x27;&quot; After several weeks, the two married and resided in Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria. Kwan later gave birth to Bernhard &quot;Bernie&quot; Pock. In December 1963, Pock was constructing a luxury hotel in the Tyrolean Alps. During Christmas of that year, Nancy Kwan visited the location and was able to participate in several pre-1964 Winter Olympics events despite having been very occupied with movies. Her contract with film production company Seven Arts led her to travel around the world to film movies. She found the separation from her son, Bernie, who was not yet a year old, difficult. She said, &quot;He&#x27;s coming into a time when he&#x27;s beginning to assert his personality.&quot; Fair-skinned and blue-eyed, Bernie had his father&#x27;s appearance.

In 1963, Kwan starred as the title character of &quot;Tamahine&quot;. Because of her role, she went to the optician to get contact lenses so she would look blue-eyed. Playing an English-Tahitian ward of the head master at an old English public school, she was praised by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; for her &quot;charming depict[ion]&quot; of the character.

In &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (1964), her seventh film, Kwan played an ichthyologist. It was her first role as a Eurasian character. Kwan&#x27;s roles were predominantly comic characters, which she said were more difficult roles than &quot;straight dramatic work&quot; owing to the necessity of more vigor and precise timing.

Kwan met Bruce Lee when he choreographed the martial arts moves in the film &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1969). In Kwan&#x27;s role in the film, she fought the character played by Sharon Tate by throwing a flying kick. Her martial arts move was based not on karate training, but on her dance foundation. Author Darrell Y. Hamamoto noted that this &quot;ironically&quot; twisted Kwan&#x27;s &quot;dragon-lady role&quot; through its underscoring the replacement of Kung Fu with Western dance moves. She became close friends with Lee and met his wife and two children. In the 1970s, both Kwan and Lee returned to Hong Kong, where they carried on their companionship.

Kwan divorced Peter Pock in June 1968. She married Hollywood screenwriter David Giler in July 1970 in a civil ceremony in Carson City, Nevada. The marriage was Kwan&#x27;s second and Giler&#x27;s first. They divorced in 1971.

That year, Kwan returned to Hong Kong with her son because her father was sick. She initially intended to remain for one year to assist him, but ultimately remained for about seven years. She did not stop her work, starring as Dr. Sue in the film &quot;Wonder Women&quot; (1973). While in Hong Kong, Kwan founded a production company, Nancy Kwan Films, which made ads mostly for people in Southeast Asia. In the 1980s, she returned to the United States, where she played characters in the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;.

In 1976 Kwan married Norbert Meisel, an actor, director, screenwriter, and producer. Like her first husband Peter Pock, as well as her former fiancé Maximilian Schell, Meisel was Austrian. &quot;I have my Austrian karma,&quot; she said in a 2021 interview. &quot;I think it&#x27;s lifetime.&quot;

In a 1993 interview with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, Kwan remarked that her son Bernie was frequently called a &quot;blond, blue-eyed Chinese&quot; because he could speak the language fluently. In 1979, the two returned to the United States because Kwan wanted him to finish his schooling there. Bernie was an actor, a martial artist, and a stunt performer. For the 1991 action comedy film &quot;Fast Getaway&quot;, fellow stunt performer Kenny Bates and he gripped hands and leaped off the Royal Gorge Bridge. They fell 900 ft before being restrained by wire rope 200 ft over the Arkansas River. Bates said their stunt was the &quot;highest &#x27;double drop&#x27; ever attempted&quot;. Kwan and Bernie recorded a tape about tai chi.

===Later years===
In 1987, Nancy Kwan co-founded the restaurant Joss Cuisine. Kwan, producer Ray Stark, and restaurateur and Hong Kong film director Cecile Tang financed the restaurant, located on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood.

Kwan sporadically records audiobooks. In 1995, Kwan recorded an audiobook for Anchee Min&#x27;s memoir &quot;Red Azalea&quot; in what &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called a &quot;coolly understated performance that allows the story&#x27;s subtleties and unexpected turns to work by themselves&quot;. In 2011, she recorded an audiobook for the 1989 memoir &quot;When Heaven and Earth Changed Places&quot; by Le Ly Hayslip with Jay Wurts. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s Patricia Holt praised Kwan&#x27;s intonation in her delivery, writing that &quot;Kwan&#x27;s faint Asian accent and careful pronunciation of Vietnamese words make Hayslip&#x27;s weaving of her past and present lives a riveting experience&quot;.

In 1993, Kwan played Gussie Yang, a &quot;tough-talking, soft-hearted Hong Kong restaurateur&quot;, in the fictional &quot;&quot;. She played a pivotal role in the film, a character based on Seattle restaurateur and political leader Ruby Chow who hires Bruce Lee as a dishwasher and gives him the funds to open a martial arts school.

In May 1993, she completed the production of a film about Eurasians, &quot;Loose Woman With No Face&quot;, which she wrote, directed, and starred. She called the film &quot;a slice of life about Euro-Asians in Los Angeles, and it&#x27;s something I know about&quot;.

In 1993, Kwan was asked about whether she was confronted with racism as a leading Asian Hollywood actress in the 1960s. Kwan replied, &quot;That was 30 years ago and (prejudice) wasn&#x27;t such a heavy issue then. I was just in great Broadway productions that were turned into films. I personally never felt any racial problems in Hollywood.&quot; In the 1990s, she faced a severe shortage of strong roles. She attributed this to both her age and the movie enterprise&#x27;s aversion to selecting Asians for non-Asian roles. In earlier years, she was able to play an Italian and a Tahitian.

In the 1990s, there were more Hollywood films about Asians. Kwan could have capitalized on the trend through a role in the 1993 film &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;. Because the filmmakers refused to excise a line calling &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; a &quot;...horrible racist film,&quot; she passed on the role.

In November 1993, Kwan co-starred in the two-character play &quot;Arthur and Leila&quot; about two siblings who struggle with their Chinese identities. It debuted in the Bay Front Theater in Fort Mason, San Francisco, and moved to Los Angeles two weeks later. &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Julio Martinez praised Kwan for her ability to &quot;flo[w] easily between haughty sophistication and girlish insecurity&quot;.

In 1994, an article in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; said that she preserved her &quot;dancer&#x27;s figure&quot; through the Chinese martial art tai chi and frequent dance sessions. That year, she assumed the role of 52-year-old Martha in Singapore Repertory Theatre&#x27;s showing of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, an &quot;intense psychological play&quot; by Edward Albee.

In 1995, she produced and acted in the feature film &quot;Rebellious&quot;. Bernie was the director, writer, and star of the film, which was co-produced by Norbert Meisel.

In 1996, when he was 33, Kwan&#x27;s son, Bernie, died after contracting AIDS from his girlfriend whom Kwan had cautioned him to avoid. Four years after his death, poet and actress Amber Tamblyn compiled her debut poetry book &quot;Of the Dawn&quot; and dedicated it to Pock. Tamblyn had acted in &quot;Rebellious&quot; when she was nine, alongside her father Russ Tamblyn. Calling Pock a &quot;big brother&quot;, she said he was the &quot;first guy&quot; to convince her to share her poems.

Nancy Kwan has appeared on television commercials even into the 1990s and appeared in &quot;late night infomercials&quot; as the spokesperson for the cosmetic &quot;Oriental Pearl Cream&quot;.

Kwan has been involved in philanthropy for AIDS awareness. In 1997, she published &quot;A Celebration of Life – Memories of My Son&quot;, a book about her son who died after being infected by HIV. She gave profits from both the book and a movie she created about him to supporting the study of AIDS and the promotion of AIDS awareness.

On March 17, 2006, &quot;cheongsam&quot;-wearing Kwan and her husband, Norbert Meisel, attended the debut performance of Hong Kong Ballet&#x27;s depiction of &quot;Suzie Wong&quot; at Sha Tin Town Hall. Kwan told &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; in 2007 that she did not consider retiring, leads to trouble. Retirees, she professed, frequently find themselves with nothing to do because they have not readied themselves for it. Kwan said, &quot;I hope I&#x27;m working until the day I die. If work is a pleasure, why not?&quot; In 2006, Kwan reunited with &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; co-star James Shigeta to perform A. R. Gurney&#x27;s two-person play &quot;Love Letters&quot;. They performed the play at Los Angeles&#x27; East West Players and San Francisco&#x27;s Herbst Theatre.

Kwan appeared in Arthur Dong&#x27;s 2007 documentary &quot;Hollywood Chinese&quot;, where other Chinese dignitaries and she discussed the past accomplishments and the impending plight of Chinese people in the film industry.

Kwan and her husband Norbert Meisel write and direct films about Asian-Americans. Kwan believes that Asians are not cast in enough films and TV shows. Meisel and she resolved to create their own scripts and films about Asian characters. In 2007, they wrote, directed, and produced &quot;Star of Sunshine&quot;, a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; film starring &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; actress Cheyenne Rushing, who plays Rachel. An ardent pianist in a conflicted household, Rachel journeys to find her restless father, a musician who deserted her when she was a mere child. In &quot;Sunshine&quot;, Rachel is supported by Kwan, the manager of a jazz club, who knows a mystery about her. In the film&#x27;s final scene, Kwan dances, an activity she has enjoyed since her youth.

Kwan wrote an introduction for the 2008 book &quot;For Goodness Sake: A Novel of the Afterlife of Suzie Wong&quot; written by American author James Clapp using the pen name Sebastian Gerard. Clapp became acquainted with Kwan through director Brian Jamieson, who was filming a documentary about Kwan&#x27;s life.

Kwan serves as a spokeswoman for the Asian American Voters Coalition, a pan-Asian political organization established in 1986 to aid Asian actors.

In her performing arts career, Kwan has appeared in two television series and over 50 films. &quot;The Straits Times&quot; reported in March 2011 that Kwan continues to serve as a film screenwriter and executive.

Kwan currently resides in Los Angeles and has family members in Hong Kong. Once every few years, she travels to the former colony.

<text>In baseball, interference occurs in situations in which a person illegally changes the course of play from what is expected. Interference might be committed by players on the offense, players not currently in the game, catchers, umpires, or spectators. Each type of interference is covered differently by the rules.

==Offensive interference==

The most common incidence of interference occurs when a member of the offensive team physically hinders the defensive team, decreasing its chances to make an out or increasing the chance that a baserunner will advance. Whenever this &quot;offensive interference&quot; occurs, the ball becomes dead. If the interference was committed by a batter or a baserunner, that player is called out and all other runners must return to the bases they occupied at the time of the interference. If interference is committed by a runner with the obvious intent of preventing a double play, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference. If interference is committed by the batter-runner before he reaches first base with the possible intent of preventing a double play, the runner closest to scoring is called out in addition to the batter-runner. If interference is committed by a retired runner or by some other member of the offensive team, the runner who is most likely to have been put out will be called out.

Under Little League (LL), high school (NFHS) and college (NCAA) rules, if interference is committed by a runner with the effect of preventing a likely double play, regardless of his intent, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference.

Also under NFHS rules only, all runners are required to attempt to avoid collisions. If a runner fails to do so, he is guilty of malicious contact, which is one kind of offensive interference. Malicious contact carries the additional penalty of ejection from the game. In contrast, in professional and higher amateur baseball, violent collisions can occur without any interference (or obstruction), especially when a fielder is receiving a thrown ball near a base where a runner is trying to reach. Any collision that occurs in this situation is not interference, because the fielder&#x27;s action is in regard to a thrown ball. As long as such a runner&#x27;s actions are related to his attempt to reach the base, he cannot be called for interference. The most common case of this is when a runner is attempting to score and the catcher has control of the ball. If the catcher is in the path between third base and home plate, the baserunner may strike the catcher with his body in an attempt to dislodge the ball from the catcher&#x27;s hand and then reach home plate. This is usually attempted only when the play is close. When the catcher is set up and ready, the runner has little chance of knocking the ball away. Any such attempt presents a significant chance of injury to the baserunner, which has prompted the malicious contact rule to be used more often.
In addition to the general subjective definition of offensive interference, it is also interference by specific rule when:
* The bat hits the ball a second time in fair territory, such as while the bat is being dropped;
* A batter or runner intentionally deflects the course of a batted ball in any manner;
* A member of the offensive team stands near a base to impersonate a baserunner or to otherwise confuse or hinder the defense;
* A coach physically assists a runner in returning to or leaving first or third base;
* A batter, while running to first base, runs outside the three-foot running lane and interferes with the fielder taking a throw at first base;
* A runner makes contact with a batted ball that did not go through or by a fielder, unless no infielder had a chance to immediately field the ball (in this instance, the runner is out, the batter is credited with a base hit, and no other runner advances unless forced to advance one base);
* A runner makes contact with a fielder attempting to field a batted ball, except the batter with the catcher in the immediate vicinity of home plate immediately after the ball was batted; or
* A member of the offensive team intentionally touches a thrown ball, or intentionally hinders a fielder attempting to make a throw.
* The batter physically hinders the catcher&#x27;s opportunity to throw out a baserunner while standing outside of the batter&#x27;s box.

There are some exceptions to the penalty for offensive interference.
* If there are fewer than two outs and a runner is trying to score, and the batter interferes with the tag attempt at home plate, then the runner is out for the batter&#x27;s interference, while the batter is not out. If there are two outs in this situation, the normal interference penalty applies: the batter is out and the run does not score.
* If a runner&#x27;s interference is caused by his being positioned at a legally occupied base and the fielder is trying to make a play on a batted ball in the vicinity of the base, interference is not called.

===Verbal interference===
At some levels of play, verbal as well as physical hindrance can be called for interference. For example, if a runner or other member of the offense calls out &quot;foul&quot; on a fair ball or &quot;mine&quot; on a fly ball, he may cause the defense to react differently from how they otherwise would have, resulting in an interference call. 
Some professional leagues do not have a distinction for verbal interference or obstruction and leave it as umpire judgement. The NPB in Japan, for example, verbal interference is illegal and runners will be called out on any spoken word meant to confuse a fielder or fielders during a play. In Major League Baseball, it is left as umpire judgement.

===Cases of offensive interference===
On October 15, 1969, in Game 4 of the 1969 World Series between the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles, Mets pinch hitter J.C. Martin attempted a tenth-inning sacrifice bunt which Orioles pitcher Pete Richert fielded; however, Richert&#x27;s throw to first base hit Martin on the wrist and the ball ricocheted into right field, allowing Mets baserunner Rod Gaspar to score the winning run from second base. The Orioles protested vehemently, but although replays showed Martin ran inside the first base line, umpires ruled the play valid and no interference was called. The win gave the &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; a 3–1 lead in the series, and they closed out their championship season with a win the next day.

An alleged offensive interference occurred in the third game of the 1975 World Series. With a runner on first, Cincinnati Reds player Ed Armbrister laid down a sacrifice bunt. Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk attempted to field the ball and throw to second base and get the lead runner out. However, Armbrister did not immediately run to first base but instead stood essentially still in the vicinity of home plate, forcing Fisk to jump into him in order to make the throw. As a result, Fisk&#x27;s throw went into center field, and the Reds ended up with runners on first and third with no outs. The Red Sox protested, saying that Armbrister interfered, but home plate umpire Larry Barnett refused to change the call. The rules at the time did not mention a batter-runner/catcher collision, but the official interpretation issued to the umpires did; there is no violation on such unintentional contact. The Red Sox lost the game, and the series.

==Umpire&#x27;s interference==

It is &quot;umpire&#x27;s interference&quot; when the umpire hinders a catcher&#x27;s attempt to throw anywhere. In this case, if the catcher&#x27;s direct throw retires a runner the play stands. If not, the ball is dead and all runners must return to the bases they had most recently touched before the catcher&#x27;s throw.

It is also umpire&#x27;s interference when an umpire is struck by a fair batted ball before it touches a fielder including the pitcher or passes near an infielder other than the pitcher. This can occur either because an umpire is inside the diamond or because the ball crosses 1st or 3rd base in fair territory then hooks or slices foul into the umpire positioned just outside the line behind the bag. In this case, the ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, and all other runners advance only if forced. A common example is when a batter hits a fair ball down the first base line so hard that the first base umpire can&#x27;t avoid it. Even though the hit would have surely been a bases-clearing double or triple without the interference, it is only a single and runners advance no more than one base. This happened in the 1989 All-Star Game when the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Bobby Bonilla led off the 9th with a scorching grounder that would have been an easy double, but it hit first base umpire Bob Engel in the legs as he tried to jump out of the way. Instead of being in scoring position down 5–3, Bonilla was forced out at 2nd the next play and the game ended on a double play.

==Catcher&#x27;s interference==
&quot;Catcher&#x27;s interference&quot; is called when the catcher physically hinders the batter&#x27;s legal swing at a pitched ball. This usually occurs when a catcher squats too close to home plate, so that the batter&#x27;s bat hits the catcher&#x27;s mitt as the batter swings. This is most likely to happen on attempted steals where the catcher is anxious to catch the ball as soon as possible and may move his entire body or mitt forward a bit. It also more commonly happens to hitters who let pitches get deeper and take later swings, such as Jacoby Ellsbury, who holds the record for the most times interfered with by a catcher in both a single season and his career.

In this case, play continues until the play ends and the umpire calls time. The penalty is that the batter is awarded first base, any runner attempting to steal is awarded that base, and all other runners advance only if forced. Additionally, the catcher is charged with an error and the batter is not charged with an at-bat. However, if the playing result is more advantageous than the penalty, the offense may elect to ignore the infraction (e.g., if the batter-runner reaches first safely and all other runners advance at least one base, catcher&#x27;s interference is ignored by rule, or if a run scores even though the play resulted in an out the offense may elect to take the play versus the penalty by appealing to the calling umpire).

Under high school (NFHS) rules only, catcher&#x27;s interference is instead called &quot;catcher&#x27;s obstruction&quot;.

==Spectator interference==
When a spectator or other person not associated with one of the teams (including such staff as bat and ball boys/girls) alters play in progress, it is &quot;spectator interference&quot;, colloquially called &quot;fan interference&quot;. It is worth noting that the latter is also (incorrectly) used to refer to fan obstruction – for instance a spectator running onto the field and tackling a baserunner. The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or charge any outs that, in his judgment, would have occurred without the interference.

Such interference often occurs when a spectator in the first row of seats reaches onto the field to attempt to grab a fair or foul fly ball. If the umpire judges that the fielder could have caught the ball over the field (i.e., the ball would have not crossed over the plane of the wall), he will rule the batter out on spectator interference. Also, spectators who commit interference are usually ejected from the stadium.

However, spectators &quot;are&quot; allowed to touch and/or catch a ball that is still in play once the ball has broken the plane of the spectators&#x27; side of the wall. Spectators may even use a certain level of non-violent force (for example, they may attempt to dislodge a ball out of a defender&#x27;s glove) provided they do not themselves cross the plane in their efforts. The area where both fielders and spectators are legally allowed to touch the ball is colloquially called &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;.

Umpires typically grab their wrist above their head to signal that spectator interference has occurred.

===Cases of possible spectator interference===
*On October 9, 1996, the eighth inning of Game 1 of the American League Championship Series, with the Yankees trailing 4–3, Derek Jeter, the Yankee shortstop, hit a fly to the right field wall. Oriole right fielder Tony Tarasco backtracked and positioned himself to catch Jeter&#x27;s fly ball just short of the wall. Jeffrey Maier, a 12-year-old spectator seated in the bleachers, reached out to catch the ball, and deflected it away from Tarasco and over the fence. Umpire Rich Garcia ruled the play a home run rather than calling Jeter out on spectator interference or awarding him a double. Garcia later said he believed the ball was uncatchable, but video of the play shows the ball was touched in the field of play, although Garcia may not have been in position to see the interference. Maier&#x27;s interference and Garcia&#x27;s call resulted in a game-tying home run for Jeter. The Yankees won the game in extra innings and prevailed in the series in five games.
*On July 6, 2010, the Seattle Mariners trailed the visiting Kansas City Royals 3–2 in the 8th inning of a game. With runner Ichiro Suzuki on first base for the Mariners, Mariners designated hitter Russell Branyan hit a double down the right field line. As Royals outfielder David DeJesus attempted to make a play on the ball, a young fan reached onto the field and picked up the ball. The play was ruled an automatic double, and the umpires ruled that Branyan would take second base and that Ichiro would take third base, denying him a potential opportunity to score on the play. Both Ichiro and Branyan would be stranded on the bases, and the Royals held on for the 3–2 victory.

*On October 19, 2010, in the second inning of Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, with no score, Yankees player Robinson Canó hit a fly to the right field wall. Rangers right fielder Nelson Cruz backtracked and positioned himself to jump in the air and attempt to catch Cano&#x27;s fly ball at the wall. Jared Macchirole, a 20-year-old spectator seated in the bleachers, reached out to catch the ball, and in doing so, made contact with the glove of Cruz, ending his upward momentum, and ensuring that Cruz would not catch the ball, that did reach the seats. Right Field Umpire Jim Reynolds ruled the play a home run rather than calling for an instant replay review to determine whether spectator interference had occurred as specified by MLB&#x27;s new rule regarding instant replay. The potential interference and umpire&#x27;s call resulted in a solo home run for Cano, and the Yankees taking a 1–0 lead at the time.
*On September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a fly ball to deep right field. Originally ruled a live ball, instant replay showed Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was interfered with by multiple fans during his opportunity to catch a ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected to play the game under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage.
*On June 8, 2014, Brian Roberts of the New York Yankees was at bat against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium in the top of the 4th inning. He hit a ball down the first base line that the first base umpire ruled fair. Thinking it was a foul ball, a ball person in foul territory in right field picked the ball up and gave it to a fan. The play was ruled dead and Brian Roberts was awarded a double. However, the Yankees did not score that inning and they lost the game 2–1.
*On August 17, 2018, during the fifth inning of a game between the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks, Padres batter Eric Hosmer hit a fly ball to deep left center. Diamondbacks outfielder Jon Jay moved to the wall in an attempt to catch it, but a fan seated in the front row reached over the wall with his cup of beer. The ball struck the cup and bounced over the wall into the outfield seats; the play was initially ruled a home run, then reviewed at the Diamondbacks&#x27; request. Fan interference was not called, and the play was allowed to stand. The Padres ultimately lost the game, 9–4.
*On October 17, 2018, during the fourth game of the 2018 American League Championship Series, Houston Astros batter Jose Altuve hit a potential two-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. Although the ball went into the stands despite Boston Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts&#x27; leaping attempt to catch it at the wall, Altuve was ruled out due to fan interference, and the call stood after being reviewed on video. Boston ultimately won the game 8-6 and would go on to win both the ALCS and the 2018 World Series.

==Common misconceptions==
When a fielder hinders a baserunner, the situation is called obstruction, not interference. Baseball commentators often mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference.

Not all physical contact in baseball is interference. Accidental contact that has little or no effect on play is usually ignored; physical contact must result in an advantageous situation for the offense to be considered offensive interference. Nor must physical contact occur for interference to be called; a runner may interfere with a fielder simply by hindering the fielder&#x27;s ability to attempt to make a play on a batted ball.

If a baserunner is hit by a fair batted ball while standing on a base, the runner is out, unless the ball has already passed an infielder or the infield fly rule has been declared. The base is not a sanctuary.

However, being in contact with a base may protect a baserunner from being called out for interference in the case of a fielder attempting to field a batted ball.

<doc id="990772" wikidata="Q5465463" url="?curid=990772" title="Food fight">
<text>A food fight is a form of chaotic collective behavior, in which foodstuffs are thrown at others in the manner of projectiles. These projectiles are not made nor meant to harm others, but to simply ignite a fight filled with spontaneous food throwing. Food fights may be impromptu examples of rebellion or violence; however, they can also be planned events. In organized food fights, the food &quot;weapons&quot; are usually all of one kind, or of a limited variety (e.g., tomatoes), while in impromptu food fights (for example, in a school cafeteria), any food within reach is used.

Though usually associated with juvenile settings such as schools, food fights have a long history throughout the world as a form of festive public entertainment or pastime. They have traditionally been popular since the early Middle Ages in Europe during seasonal festivals, especially in the summertime. For example, Spanish &quot;La Tomatina&quot; is still regularly held every August in the Valencian town of Buñol, in which participants pelt each other with tomatoes, as is the Battle of the Oranges held in the Italian town of Ivrea where, as the name would suggest, the oranges are used instead. An example from outside of Europe is the Chinese &quot;Tofu Festival&quot;. It is held on the 13th day of the first month of the lunar calendar in Shegangxia village, Fogang County, Guangdong Province. Participants throw slabs of tofu at each other.

Food fights have occurred in the meetings of the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan.

Food fights have also become a common element in slapstick comedy, with the pie in the face gag being especially well-known. Food fights are frequently featured in children&#x27;s television and books, usually as an example of childish, destructive or reckless behavior. Movies with notable food fights include &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; (1927), &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), and &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978). A custard pie fight was filmed for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), but was cut before the final print.

<text>The Camden markets are a number of adjoining large retail markets, often collectively referred to as Camden Market or Camden Lock, located in the historic former Pickfords stables, in Camden Town, London. It is situated north of the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent&#x27;s Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock). Famed for their cosmopolitan image, products sold on the stalls include crafts, clothing, books, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week.

A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century, the only significant market in the area. On 30 March 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets. The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.
The markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day. Opening later extended to Saturdays for most of the market. A number of traders, mainly those in fixed premises—an increasing proportion—operate throughout the week, although the weekend remains the peak period.

Since 2014 most of the markets were acquired by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, who heavily developed them from stalls set up for the day to permanent structures. In 2022 Sagi&#x27;s company LabTech offered them for sale, hoping for a price of around £1.5 billion. Status was not known .

== The markets ==
There are six distinct Camden markets.

=== Camden Lock Market ===

Camden Lock Market is situated by the Regent&#x27;s Canal on a site formerly occupied by warehouses and other premises associated with the canal. By the early 1970s the canal trade had ceased and a northern urban motorway was planned that would cut through the site, making any major permanent redevelopment impossible, and in 1974 a temporary market was established. By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of Camden Town. Originally, the Lock was a market for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings.

While the range of goods has since widened, with stalls selling books, new and second-hand clothing, and jewellery, the Lock retains its focus as the principal Camden market for crafts. There is a large selection of fast food stalls. In 1991 a three-storey indoor market hall designed by architect John Dickinson was opened on the site of the first outdoor market. In the style of the traditional 19th century industrial architecture and housing in the area, it is built of brick and cast iron. It attracted large numbers of visitors partly due to stalls being open on Sundays, when previous to the Sunday Trading Act 1994, shops were not permitted to operate on Sundays. On 28 February 1993, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb hidden in a litter bin on Camden High Street near the market, shortly after lunchtime. The bomb injured 11 people.

From 2006, a large indoor market hall was constructed in a yard between the Camden Lock Market and the Stables Market that was previously used for open air stalls. In November 2007 a large part of the Stables Market was demolished as part of a long-term redevelopment plan for the area and rebuilt as a year-round permanent market area.

In 2016, Urban Markets Company acquired Camden Lock and paid between £300m and £400m for the one-acre site. The joint venture between the founders of Camden Lock and Millitarne Retail Resorts International, the retail developers, was financed by Brockton Capital, a real estate private equity fund. Camden Lock Market is set to have a £20 million makeover to transform it into a traditional arts and craft centre for Londoners. The Urban Market Company plans to double the enclosed area and increase trading space by 15,000 square feet.

====2017 fire====

Early on 10 July 2017, shortly after midnight, a large fire (cause currently unknown) occurred at the Camden Lock Market. At least 70 firefighters and 10 engines attended.

=== Stables Market ===
The Stables Market was owned by Bebo Kobo, Richard Caring and Elliot Bernerd of Chelsfield Partners until 2014. It was sold in 2014 for $685 million to Market Tech PLC, a UK AIM listed public company, later named LabTech. The market is located in the historic former Pickfords stables and Grade II listed horse hospital which served the horses pulling Pickford&#x27;s distribution vans and barges along the canal. Many of the stalls and shops are set in large arches in railway viaducts.

Chain stores are not permitted and trade is provided by a mixture of small enclosed and outdoor shops and stalls, of which some are permanent, and others hired by the day. In common with most of the other Camden markets the Stables Market has many clothes stalls. It is also the main focus for furniture in the markets. Household goods, decorative, ethnically-influenced items, and second-hand items or 20th-century antiques, many of them hand-crafted, are among the wares. There are also clothing and art pieces for alternative sub-cultures, such as goths and cybergoths. These shops include Black Rose, which caters for goths, with items such as coffin-shaped handbags, and Cyberdog, which houses much cyber-style &quot;neon&quot; PVC and rubber clothing.

During the weeks before Christmas 2004, radio DJ and TV presenter Chris Evans sold many of his possessions, ranging from sofas to TVs and crockery, on a stall in the Stables Market.

In October 2006 a large indoor market hall was built in a yard between the Stables Market and Camden Lock Market that was previously used for temporary open-air stalls. In the summer of 2007 redevelopment of the back of the Stables Market took place. This redevelopment consisted of two new four-storey buildings housing shops, food outlets, offices, workshops and storage facilities, as well as an exhibition space. The redevelopment included a new pedestrian route through the rear of the Stables Market exposing 25 of the existing railway arches. Pedestrian walkways—in the style of the existing historic ramp and bridge system—has opened up the site and increased access for visitors. A glass roof and cycle parking spaces has also been added.

On 19 May 2014, at around 8:00 p.m., a fire broke out at the Camden Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road where a reported 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters dealt with the blaze. No injuries were reported by the London Ambulance Service and the London Fire Brigade announced that the fire had been controlled since 9:00 p.m.

=== Hawley Wharf, previously Canal Market and Camden Lock Village ===

Owned by Bebo Kobo and OD Kobo, Camden Lock Village was the section along the canal to the east of Chalk Farm Road was known as the Canal Market and had a covered entrance tunnel leading into a general outdoor market. The market was devastated by fire on 9 February 2008 caused by unauthorised use of a liquified petroleum gas heater. After crossing the railway line, the fire badly damaged the rear of the Hawley Arms on Castlehaven Road. The market reopened in May 2009 as the Camden Lock Village. The cover over the original street entrance was removed, and a new entrance created near the railway bridge.

The market closed in early 2015, to be redeveloped over several years at a cost exceeding £500m as Hawley Wharf. The stalls were replaced by a four-storey covered structure, with units housing sixty fast-food providers, 150 shops, and co-working offices. The development also provided 200 homes. Hawley Wharf&#x27;s sites started opening in 2021.

=== Buck Street Market===
The Buck Street Market was an outdoor market focusing on clothes. There is no formal or legal definition of Camden Market; the Buck Street Market&#x27;s sign read &#x27;The Camden Market&#x27;. A few stallholders designed their own wares, while at the weekend these designs were more likely to be found in the Electric Ballroom market.

The market closed in its existing form, initially during later postponed plans to rebuild Camden Town tube station. It reopened as a multi-floor structure.

=== Electric Ballroom ===
The Electric Ballroom on Camden High Street has been a night club since the 1950s. The weekend market had been operating here for at least 24 years but closed at short notice in 2015, leaving many staff and traders unemployed.

=== Inverness Street Market ===
A small street market has operated in Inverness Street near Camden Town Tube station since the late 19th century, mostly selling produce, rather than ready-to-eat food, until the 21st century. It started losing its traditional stalls once local supermarkets opened, a trend accelerated by the closing of a nearby bus stop which facilitated access; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had been replaced by &quot;touristy&quot; stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.

===Ownership===
The markets were originally a collection of stalls on land with various owners, evolving into a patchwork of more than 1,000 stalls, bars, shops, and cafes.

In 2014, Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi started buying property in the Camden Market area. By March 2015, having purchased the four most important of the six sections of the market, he announced plans to invest £300 million in developing the market area by 2018. The markets, initially a collection of simple stalls plus the Stables building, were heavily developed with permanent structures. In 2022 they were offered for sale with investment bank Rothschild &amp; Co overseeing the sale process, the owner hoping for a price of around £1.5 billion for the markets plus housing, co-working spaces, and a three-floor leisure centre called Babylon Park. Status was not known .

<text>Hollywood (also known as Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film) is a British television documentary miniseries produced by Thames Television and originally broadcast on ITV in 1980. Written and directed by film historians Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, it explored the establishment and development of the Hollywood studios and their cultural impact during the silent film era of the 1910s and 1920s. At the 1981 BAFTA TV Awards, the series won for Best Original Television Music and was nominated for Best Factual Series, Best Film Editing and Best Graphics.

The series has seldom been released on home video formats, apparently due to the complexity of obtaining home video rights to all of the film clips used. It is available on the Internet Archive.

In 1995, Brownlow and Gill produced the followup series, &quot;Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood&quot;, which explores the rise of the silent film industry in Sweden, Germany, France and Great Britain.

== Synopsis ==
The series consists of 13 50-minute episodes, with each episode dealing with a specific aspect of Hollywood history. The actor James Mason, an enthusiast of the period, supplied the narration while a lilting and expressive score was contributed by Carl Davis.

Technical quality was an important aspect of the production. Silent films had often been screened on television from poor-quality copies running at an inaccurate speed, usually accompanied by honky tonk piano music. &quot;Hollywood&quot; used silent film clips sourced from the best available material, shown at their original running speed via a polygonal prism telecine, and with an orchestral score, giving viewers a chance to see what they originally looked and sounded like. For instance, the first episode features a clip of &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot;, produced in 1903 with the aforementioned stereotypical poor quality print and music and then compares that with a clip of &quot;The Fire Brigade&quot;, produced over two decades later in 1926, in a high quality print run at the proper speed with full orchestral accompaniment.

The producers filmed the recollections of many of the period&#x27;s surviving participants, and illustrated their interviews with scenes from their various films, as well as production still photographs, and historical photographs of the Los Angeles environs. Some of these interviews are notable for being among the only filmed interviews given by their subjects.

==Participants==
Among the notable people who contributed interviews were:

* ActorsMary Astor, Eleanor Boardman, Louise Brooks, Olive Carey, Iron Eyes Cody, Jackie Coogan, Dolores Costello, Viola Dana, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Janet Gaynor, Leatrice Joy, Lillian Gish, Bessie Love, Ben Lyon, Marion Mack, Tim McCoy, Colleen Moore, Charles &#x27;Buddy&#x27; Rogers, Gloria Swanson, Blanche Sweet, John Wayne, Eva von Berne, and Lois Wilson.
* DirectorsDorothy Arzner, Clarence Brown, Karl Brown, Frank Capra, George Cukor, Allan Dwan, Byron Haskin, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Lewis Milestone, Hal Roach, Albert S. Rogell, King Vidor, and William Wyler.

Also interviewed were choreographer Agnes de Mille, writer Anita Loos, writer Adela Rogers St. Johns, press agent/writer Cedric Belfrage, organist Gaylord Carter, cinematographers George J. Folsey, Lee Garmes, and Paul Ivano, writer Jesse L. Lasky, Jr., special effects artist A. Arnold Gillespie, Lord Mountbatten, agent Paul Kohner, producer/writer Samuel Marx, editors William Hornbeck and Grant Whytock, property man Lefty Hough, stuntmen Bob Rose, Yakima Canutt, Paul Malvern, and Harvey Parry, Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s brother Alberto Valentino, Valerie von Stroheim, and English set designer Laurence Irving.

== Episodes ==
# &quot;Pioneers&quot;The evolution of film from penny arcade curiosity to art form, from what was considered the first plot-driven film, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, through to &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, films showing the power of the medium. Early Technicolor footage, along with other color technologies, are also featured. Interviews include Lillian Gish, Jackie Coogan and King Vidor.
# &quot;In the Beginning&quot;Hollywood is transformed from a peaceful village with dusty streets and lemon groves to the birthplace of the industry in California. Silent film transcends international boundaries to become a worldwide phenomenon. Interviews include Henry King, Agnes de Mille, and Lillian Gish.
# &quot;Single Beds and Double Standards&quot;Fast success in Hollywood brings a cavalier party lifestyle, which led to shocking scandals such as Roscoe &#x27;Fatty&#x27; Arbuckle&#x27;s trial and subsequent acquittal for manslaughter. To tone down the image of Hollywood and curtail films with footage unsuitable to all audiences, Will H. Hays is appointed and introduces Hollywood&#x27;s self regulated Production Code, which would be enforced well into the 1960s, while filmmakers still found creative ways to present &#x27;adult&#x27; situations. Interviews include King Vidor and Gloria Swanson.
# &quot;Hollywood Goes to War&quot;The outbreak of World War I provides Hollywood with a successful source for plots and profits. Peacetime curtails the release of war movies, until the release of King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Big Parade&quot; in 1925. &quot;Wings&quot; (1927) earns the first Academy Award for Best Picture. As movies transition to sound, Universal releases Lewis Milestone&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, showing the German side of the conflict, becoming a powerful statement of war by the generation that fought it. Interviews include Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., King Vidor, Blanche Sweet and Lillian Gish.
# &quot;Hazard of the Game&quot;Silent films are often remembered for slapstick gags and dangerous stunts. Stuntmen took anonymous credit for very little pay and could not reveal their involvement. Stuntmen Yakima Canutt, Harvey Parry, Bob Rose and Paul Malvern tell hair-raising and humorous stories, and reveal the secrets behind many famous stunts.
# &quot;Swanson &amp; Valentino&quot;Two of the great romantic legends of the silent screen are profiled. Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s on-screen persona is remarkably different from his real personal life, as recounted by his brother, Alberto, and Gloria Swanson recalls her meteoric riseand fallwith remarkable candor.
# &quot;Autocrats&quot;Two of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest directors, Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim. One worked with the Hollywood system, the other against it. DeMille&#x27;s pictures, lavish in detail and cost, made his studio a fortune, while Von Stroheim&#x27;s similar ways, albeit to excess in footage and expense, resulted in films that were often either excessively cut by the studios or never released, leading to him being fired on several occasions. Interviews include Agnes DeMille, Gloria Swanson, Allen Dwan, and Henry King.
# &quot;ComedyA Serious Business&quot;Hollywood learned very early how to make people laugh. Comedy was king, and battling for the throne were stars like Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon and Charlie Chaplin. In a purely visual medium, their comedy was a work of genius. Interviews include Hal Roach, Sr., Jackie Coogan, Buster Keaton (archival) and Harold Lloyd (archival.)
# &quot;Out West&quot;&#x27;The Old West&#x27; was still in existence in the silent days. Old cowboys and outlaws relived their youth, and got paid for doing it, by working in films. The &#x27;western craze&#x27; really begins with stars like William S. Hart, Harry Carey and Tom Mix. Interviews include Yakima Canutt, Colonel Tim McCoy, Harvey Parry and John Wayne.
# &quot;The Man with the Megaphone&quot;Silent film directors were flamboyant pioneers, making up their technique as they went along. Filming &#x27;indoor&#x27; sets on open outdoor lots and combating the elements, communicating with actors in spite of overwhelming distraction and deafening noise, directors (male &quot;and&quot; female) fashion great films out of chaos and confusion. Interviews include Bessie Love, Janet Gaynor and King Vidor.
# &quot;Trick of the Light&quot;Skilled cameramen had the ability to turn an actress into a screen goddess, and were valuable assets to studios and stars. With the aid of art directors, they achieved some of the most amazing and dangerous sequences captured on film, pioneering photography effects used through the remainder of the 20th century. Interviews include William Wyler and Lillian Gish.
# &quot;Star Treatment&quot;Producers discovered the effect of &#x27;star power&#x27; on their box office bottom line. Creating Hollywood stars becomes its own industry, resulting in the Hollywood Star System, from which came Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, and John Gilbert, successor to Rudolph Valentino as &quot;The Great Lover&quot;. But as easily as they made them, studios could break them. Interviews include Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers, Louise Brooks and King Vidor.
# &quot;End of an Era&quot;Silent films had universal appeal, simply by replacing intertitles and dialogue cards for the foreign markets. Sound film was experimented with in many forms since the 1890s, but did not become commercially successful until &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927. Hollywood movie making was transformed and ultimately shattered, taking the careers of many silent film stars, directors and producers with it, victims of the emerging technology. Interviews include Lillian Gish, Mary Astor, Janet Gaynor, George Cukor and Frank Capra, Sr.

<text>Thomas Erdelyi (born Tamás Erdélyi, ; January 29, 1949 – July 11, 2014), known professionally as Tommy Ramone, was an American musician. He was the drummer for the influential punk rock band the Ramones from its debut in 1974 to 1978, later serving as its producer, and was the longest-surviving original member of the Ramones.

== Background ==
Tamás Erdélyi was born on January 29, 1949, in Budapest. His Jewish parents were professional photographers who survived the Holocaust by being hidden by neighbors. Many of his relatives were killed by the Nazis.

The family left Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 1957 he emigrated with his family to the United States. Initially settling in the South Bronx, the family moved up to the middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens, New York. Verona Estates in Forest Hills was the place where Tamás grew up and later described as &quot;home sweet home&quot;. He changed his name to Thomas Erdelyi.

In high school, Tommy played guitar in a mid-1960s, four-piece garage band, the Tangerine Puppets, with a schoolmate and guitarist, John Cummings, the future Johnny Ramone. After leaving school at 18, he started working as an assistant engineer at the Record Plant studio, where he worked on the production of the 1970 Jimi Hendrix album &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;.

== Producer and drummer for the Ramones ==

When the Ramones first came together, with Johnny Ramone on guitar, Dee Dee Ramone on bass and Joey Ramone on drums, Erdelyi was supposed to be the manager, but, even though he never played drums before, was drafted as the band&#x27;s drummer when Joey became the lead singer, after realizing that he couldn&#x27;t keep up with the Ramones&#x27; increasingly fast tempos. &quot;Tommy Ramone, who was managing us, finally had to sit down behind the drums, because nobody else wanted to,&quot; Dee Dee later recalled.

He remained as drummer from 1974 to 1978, playing on and co-producing their first three albums, &quot;Ramones&quot;, &quot;Leave Home&quot;, and &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, as well as the live album &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot;. His final show as a Ramones drummer was at Johnny Blitz&#x27;s benefit event at CBGB in New York on May 4, 1978.

In a 2007 interview with the BBC, Tommy Ramone said the band had been heavily influenced by 1970s glam-rock band the New York Dolls, by singer-songwriter Lou Reed and by pop-art figure Andy Warhol. He said, &quot;The scene that developed at CBGB wasn&#x27;t [for] a teenage or garage band; there was an intellectual element and that&#x27;s the way it was for The Ramones.&quot;

== Equipment ==

Throughout his time with the Ramones, Erdelyi primarily used Rogers Drums, Slingerland snare drums, and Paiste 2002 series cymbals, live and in the studio. During the band&#x27;s earliest documented shows around New York between 1974 and 1975, he used an older Rogers set in a dark wood finish that was soon replaced once Danny Fields became their manager. This new set, finished in &quot;New England White&quot;, was used heavily between 1975 and 1977, and featured a 22-inch bass drum with 9x13 and 16x16 tom-toms. Several photos taken of Ramone during these years occasionally show him using Ludwig Drums onstage as well.

On October 22, 1977, the band lost most of their equipment after it was stolen following a show in Chicago at the Aragon Ballroom and a new, larger set of Rogers &quot;Big R&quot; series drums was obtained shortly afterward. This set, also finished in &quot;New England White&quot;, featured oversized 12x15 and 18x16 tom-toms and a 24-inch bass drum and was used by Tommy for the rest of his tenure with the band, and then by Marky Ramone from the time that he joined the band in May, 1978 until his first departure in February, 1983. Featured on the recordings for &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot; and &quot;Road To Ruin&quot;, as well as in prominent performance scenes from the film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;, the set was later sold to a private collector for $10,500.

== Behind the scenes with the Ramones ==
Tommy Ramone was replaced on drums in 1978 by Marky Ramone, but handled band management and co-production for their fourth album, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;; he later returned as producer for their eighth album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot;.

Tommy Ramone wrote &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; and the majority of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; while bassist Dee Dee suggested the title. He and Ed Stasium played all the guitar solos on the albums he produced, as Johnny Ramone largely preferred playing rhythm guitar. In the 1980s he produced the Replacements album &quot;Tim&quot;, as well as Redd Kross&#x27;s &quot;Neurotica&quot;. He returned to the producer&#x27;s chair in 2002, overseeing the reunion of former Ramones C.J. and Marky for their recording of Jed Davis&#x27; Joey Ramone tribute &quot;The Bowery Electric&quot;.

On October 8, 2004, on what would have been Johnny Ramone&#x27;s 56th birthday, he played as a Ramone once again, when he joined C.J. Ramone, Daniel Rey, and Clem Burke (also known as Elvis Ramone) in the &quot;Ramones Beat Down on Cancer&quot; concert. In October 2007 in an interview to promote &quot;It&#x27;s Alive 1974–1996&quot; a two-DVD set of the band&#x27;s best televised live performances he paid tribute to his deceased bandmates:

Ramone and Claudia Tienan (formerly of underground band the Simplistics) performed as a bluegrass-based folk duo called Uncle Monk. Ramone stated: &quot;There are a lot of similarities between punk and old-time music. Both are home-brewed music as opposed to schooled, and both have an earthy energy. And anybody can pick up an instrument and start playing.&quot; He joined songwriter Chris Castle, Garth Hudson, Larry Campbell and the Womack Family Band in July 2011 at Levon Helm Studios for Castle&#x27;s album &quot;Last Bird Home&quot;.

== Illness and death ==
Tommy Ramone died at his home in Ridgewood, Queens, New York, on July 11, 2014, aged 65. He had received hospice care following unsuccessful treatment for bile duct cancer. His body is interred at New Montefiore Cemetery, in West Babylon, Suffolk County, New York.

In &quot;The Independent&quot;, Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith wrote that &quot;before Tommy left the line-up, the Ramones had already become one of the most influential punk bands of the day, playing at the infamous CBGB in the Bowery area of New York and touring for each album incessantly.&quot; In response to Ramone&#x27;s death, the band&#x27;s official Twitter account had been tweeting previous quotes from band members, including his own 1976 comment that New York was the &quot;perfect place to grow up neurotic&quot;. He added: &quot;One of the reasons that the Ramones were so unique and original was that they were four original, unique people.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Variety&quot;, Cristopher Morris said: &quot;Tommy&#x27;s driving, high-energy drum work was the turbine that powered the leather-clad foursome&#x27;s loud, antic sound.&quot;

<doc id="990788" wikidata="Q5600482" url="?curid=990788" title="Greater Britain Movement">
<text>The Greater Britain Movement was a British far right political group formed by John Tyndall in 1964 after he split from Colin Jordan&#x27;s National Socialist Movement. The name of the group was derived from &quot;The Greater Britain&quot;, a 1932 book by Oswald Mosley.

==Formation==
While the roots of the split between Tyndall and Jordan was considered to be the marriage of Jordan to Françoise Dior – who had previously been romantically involved with Tyndall – Tyndall himself stated that the rift between the two men was a consequence of an ideological clash resulting from his rejection of Jordan&#x27;s endorsement of straight Nazism and his own preference for a more &#x27;British&#x27; solution. Before the split, and during their spell as members of the British National Party, Jordan had faced the same criticism from John Bean with Tyndall increasingly echoing Bean&#x27;s view. This division led to a showdown at the April 1964 NSM conference when Tyndall demanded that Jordan give control of the movement to him.

On 11 May 1964, Jordan moved to expel Tyndall from the NSM, although the following day Tyndall claimed that, having taken control of the group, he had expelled Jordan. However, soon afterwards Tyndall gave up his NSM membership and, along with most of the staff from the party&#x27;s London headquarters, left the group. In August 1964, he announced the formation of the Greater Britain Movement and began publishing its magazine, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, a name taken from the NSM&#x27;s largely failed attempt to set up a paramilitary wing. The GBM also gained the support of James McIntyre&#x27;s National Student Front which until that time had been loyal to the NSM. Tyndall would later claim that he had formed the GBM merely as a stopgap to keep his supporters united, stating that he felt, even in 1964, that their future lay in working more closely with other similar groups.

==Policies==
The first issue of &quot;Spearhead&quot; stated that the new movement would adhere &quot;without fear and without compromise to every tenet of the national socialist creed&quot; albeit &quot;in a manner more in touch with British affairs and much more in touch with British interests and aims&quot;. However whilst leader of the GBM, Tyndall wrote his &quot;Six Principles of British Nationalism&quot; in which he broke from the Nazism of Jordan, and called for a parliamentary strategy towards a government that would be corporatist, racialist, and based on the principle of leadership. This state would be ratified by regular referendums, although liberal democracy would be brought to an end.

The new movement also advocated laws banning marriage between people of different races and the use of medical procedures to prevent those with &quot;hereditary defects&quot; from having children:

Tyndall&#x27;s ideas have been characterised as an attempt to construct a specifically British national socialism, rather than following Jordan&#x27;s route of simply transplanting the German version. Such was Tyndall&#x27;s desire to forge a specifically British form of Nazism that he was characterised by Jordan and other critics as a &quot;John Bull in jackboots&quot;.

==Development==
The GBM did not contest any elections and rather became known for publicity stunts and criminal acts. An example of the sort of action they were fond of was provided soon after the group was formed when Tyndall&#x27;s deputy Martin Webster attempted to assault President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta, a headline-grabbing stunt that also saw Webster serve a short spell in prison. Tyndall had also been present at the incident, which took place as Kenyatta exited a hotel in London at which he was staying, and Tyndall was given a £25 fine for the abuse he shouted into a megaphone during the attack.

The GBM&#x27;s policy of provocative street activity meant that it faced frequent opposition. A meeting in the East End of London on 4 October 1964 was attacked by opponents, as was another in Dalston the following October whilst earlier, in August 1965, Tyndall had been shot at five times whilst in the group&#x27;s headquarters in Norwood. The group&#x27;s main benefactor was an antiques dealer named Gordon Brown and in late 1966 he gave Tyndall the funds to purchase a small shop in Tulse Hill which Tyndall converted into the Nationalist Centre. The centre welcomed regular visitors from the BNP and League of Empire Loyalists although, according to the BNP&#x27;s Rodney Legg, some of the older LEL members were appalled by the Nazi ephemera and loaded guns on display.

In January 1965, Tyndall had attempted to make the GBM the leading lights in the World Union of National Socialists but after getting in touch with the American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell Tyndall was dismayed to find that Jordan was still recognised as leader of the body and that the NSM was still the British chapter. The incident helped to push the GBM further away from the neo-Nazi fringe and towards the other groups on the far-right. Removed from the Nazi option and with the GBM individually failing to make much headway or attract much support, Tyndall authorised GBM members to support the campaigns of both the BNP and the LEL as well as the Patriotic Party in March 1965. According to John Bean Tyndall wrote personally to Oswald Mosley, A.K. Chesterton and Bean around the same time suggesting that as their four movements had been co-operating unofficially on activities in support of Rhodesia a more formal alliance between the GBM, Union Movement, LEL and BNP should be agreed upon. Nothing came of these overtures however. Meanwhile, Tyndall had not abandoned his attempts to build links internationally and instead forged an alliance between the GBM and the National States Rights Party, a far-right group in the United States that had grown critical of Rockwell and the American Nazi Party.

The GBM, however, remained one of the more extreme groups on the far right as was evidenced in 1966 when a number of members were imprisoned for an arson attack on a synagogue, with Tyndall later also jailed for possession of a firearm. The incidents derailed the GBM&#x27;s drive for unity somewhat as LEL leader A.K. Chesterton was averse to such actions, preferring to maintain a legalist approach. As a result, the GBM undertook negotiations with the BNP and the Racial Preservation Society in early 1966 aimed at effecting a closer union but these came to nothing, with the RPS in particular turning the request down flat.

==Towards merger==
During the summer of 1966 Tyndall and his movement grew close to A.K. Chesterton and the two soon agreed that the hefty defeat inflicted on the Conservative Party in the 1966 general election had opened up space for a new far right party with Tyndall arguing in &quot;Spearhead&quot; that there was &quot;no longer any great political force representative of patriotic right-wing principles&quot;. Chesterton was impressed by the organisational skills demonstrated by Tyndall in the GBM, although he was also suspicious of his Nazi past whilst Andrew Fountaine was opposed to any GBM membership, and so they did not invite GBM to join the National Front in 1967.

The first issue of &quot;Combat&quot;, the organ of the British National Party, to be published following the formation of the National Front (which had absorbed the British National Party) specifically stated that the GBM &quot;would not be coming into the new movement and ... their past utterances on anti-Semitism and pro-Nazism would certainly not be a part of National Front policy&quot;. However, before the year was out Chesterton relented and allowed the GBM to join the NF &#x27;on probation&#x27;, leading to the GBM ceasing to exist. In June of that year Tyndall told the GBM membership, which at that point stood at 138, that the movement was disbanded and that they should join the National Front as individuals.

<doc id="990790" wikidata="Q3134064" url="?curid=990790" title="H. C. McNeile">
<text>Herman Cyril McNeile, MC (28 September 1888 – 14 August 1937), commonly known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper, was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War, he started writing short stories and getting them published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the pen name &quot;Sapper&quot; by Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the Royal Engineers.

After the war McNeile left the army and continued writing, although he changed from war stories to thrillers. In 1920 he published &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot;, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.

McNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other novels and story collections that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the inter-war period before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war.

McNeile&#x27;s stories are either directly about the war, or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with upper class Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen at the time as &quot;simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen&quot;, after the Second World War his work was criticised as having fascist overtones, while also displaying the xenophobia and anti-semitism apparent in some other writers of the period. 
==Biography==

===Early life===
McNeile was born in Bodmin, Cornwall. He was the son of Malcolm McNeile, a captain in the Royal Navy who at the time was governor of the naval prison at Bodmin, and Christiana Mary (née Sloggett). The McNeile family had ancestral roots from both Belfast and Scotland, and counted a general in the British Indian Army among their members.

McNeile did not like either of his given names but preferred to be called Cyril, although he was always known by his friends as Mac. After attending a prep school in Eastbourne, he was further educated at Cheltenham College. On leaving the college, he joined the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in July 1907. He underwent further training at the Royal School of Military Engineering before a short posting to Aldershot Garrison. He received promotion to lieutenant in June 1910 and was posted to Canterbury, serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop, until January 1914, when he was posted to Malta.

In 1914 McNeile was promoted to the rank of captain. He was still in Malta when the war broke out and was ordered to France in October 1914; he travelled via England and married Violet Evelyn Baird on 31 October 1914. She was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Baird Douglas of the Cameron Highlanders.

===First World War service===
On 2 November 1914 McNeile travelled to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. Few details are known about McNeile&#x27;s wartime service, as his records were destroyed by incendiary bombs during the Second World War. He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front, including 1st Field Squadron RE, 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the 33rd Division.

McNeile&#x27;s first known published story, &quot;Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy&quot;, was serialised on page four of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; from 13 January 1915. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names except during their half-pay sabbaticals, many would write under a pseudonym; Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, gave McNeile the pen name &quot;Sapper&quot;, as the Royal Engineers were commonly known as the Sappers. McNeile later confided that he had started writing through &quot;sheer boredom&quot;. Some of his stories appeared on page four of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; over the following months. Northcliffe was impressed by his writing and attempted, but failed, to have him released from the army to work as a war correspondent. By the end of 1915, he had written two collections of short stories, &quot;The Lieutenant and Others&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.&quot;, both of which were published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Although many of the stories had already appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, between 1916 and 1918 &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.&quot; sold 135,000 copies and &quot;The Lieutenant and Others&quot; published in 1915 sold 139,000 copies. By the end of the war he had published three more collections, &quot;Men, Women, and Guns&quot; (1916), &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Human Touch&quot; (1918). In 1916 he wrote a series of articles titled &quot;The Making of an Officer&quot;, which appeared under the initials C. N., in five issues of &quot;The Times&quot; between 8 and 14 June 1916. The articles were aimed at young and new officers to explain their duties to them; these were collected together and published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton later in 1916.

During his time with the Royal Engineers, McNeile saw action at the First and Second Battles of Ypres—he was gassed at the second battle—and the Battle of the Somme. In 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross and was mentioned in dispatches; in November that year he was gazetted to acting major. From 1 April to 5 October 1918, he commanded a battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel; the scholar Lawrence Treadwell observes that &quot;for an engineer to command an infantry regiment was ... a rarity&quot;. 18th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment under McNeile saw action for the remainder of his command, and were involved in fighting during the Hundred Days Offensive in the St. Quentin-Cambrai sector in September 1918; during the year, he was again mentioned in dispatches. On 2 October 1918 he broke his ankle and was briefly hospitalised, which forced him to relinquish his command of the battalion on 4 October. He was on convalescent leave when the war ended in November 1918. During the course of the war, he had spent a total of 32 months in France, and had probably been gassed more than once. His literary output from 1915 to 1918 accounted for more than 80 collected and uncollected stories. His brother—also in the Royal Engineers—had been killed earlier in the war.

===Post-war years===
McNeile had a quiet life after the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that &quot;as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the exciting life&quot;. Although he was an &quot;unremittingly hearty man&quot;, he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and &quot;liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship&quot;; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as &quot;not everybody&#x27;s cup of tea&quot;, and commented that &quot;he was loud in every possible way—in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life&quot;. McNeile and his wife had two sons.

On 13 June 1919 McNeile retired onto the reserve officer list and was confirmed in the rank of major. The same year he also published a novel, &quot;Mufti&quot;, in which he introduced a type of character as &quot;the Breed&quot;, a class of Englishman who was patriotic, loyal and &quot;physically and morally intrepid&quot;. Although well received by the critics, the book failed commercially and, by the end of 1922, had only sold 16,700 copies from its first print run of 20,000; the unsold copies were pulped and the novel went out of print later that year.

In 1920 McNeile published &quot;Bull-Dog Drummond&quot;, whose eponymous hero—a member of &quot;the Breed&quot;—became his most famous creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel&#x27;s sub-title as &quot;a demobilised officer who found peace dull&quot; after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an &quot;apparently brainless hunk of a man&quot;, who was also a gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as &quot;a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact the war&quot;. The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an &quot;unspeakable public school bully&quot;. Drummond&#x27;s main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as &quot;the slinky epitome of a twenties &#x27;vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, &quot;a true &quot;femme fatale&quot;&quot;. After Carl Peterson&#x27;s death in &quot;The Final Count&quot;, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in &quot;Bull-Dog Drummond&quot;—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile&#x27;s books, and in a further five by Fairlie.

McNeile adapted &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; for the stage. It was produced at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre during the 1921–22 season, with Gerald du Maurier playing the title role; it ran for 428 performances. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with A. E. Matthews as Drummond. Later in 1922 McNeile resigned his reserve commission with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and moved as a tax exile to Territet, Montreux, Switzerland, with his wife; the Swiss countryside was later described in a number of his stories.

The following year McNeile introduced the character of Jim Maitland, a &quot;footloose sahib of the period&quot;. Maitland was the protagonist of the 1923 novel &quot;Jim Maitland&quot;; he later appeared in a second novel in 1931, &quot;The Island of Terror&quot;. Around the time McNeile killed off the Carl Peterson character in &quot;The Final Count&quot; (1926), he also introduced the character Ronald Standish, who first appeared in &quot;The Saving Clause&quot; (1927) and &quot;Tiny Carteret&quot; (1930) before becoming the protagonist in two collections of short stories, &quot;Ronald Standish&quot; (1933) and &quot;Ask for Ronald Standish&quot; (1936). The character also appeared in the final three Drummond novels, &quot;Knock-Out&quot; (1933), &quot;Bull-Dog Drummond at Bay&quot; (1935) and &quot;Challenge&quot; (1937). Standish was a sportsman who played cricket for England and was a part-time consultant with the War Office.

In 1929 McNeile edited a volume of short stories from O. Henry, &quot;The Best of O. Henry&quot;; the stories had served as models for him when he had started as a writer. The same year, the film &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; was released, starring Ronald Colman in the title role. Colman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony. The film earned $750,000 at the box office, and McNeile received an estimated £5,000 for the rights to his novel. The same year he wrote his second play—&quot;The Way Out&quot;—which was staged at the Comedy Theatre in January 1930. About a year later he and his wife returned to England, and settled near Pulborough, West Sussex.

In 1935 McNeile, Fairlie, Sidney Gilliat and J.O.C. Orton collaborated on the screenplay &quot;Bulldog Jack&quot;, a &quot;comedy thriller&quot; with Jack Hulbert and Fay Wray, which was produced by Gaumont British.

===Death and legacy===
In 1937 McNeile was working with Fairlie on the play &quot;Bulldog Drummond Hits Out&quot; when he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. He came to an agreement with Fairlie for the play to continue after his death and for Fairlie to continue writing the Drummond stories. McNeile died on 14 August 1937 at his home in West Chiltington, West Sussex. Although most sources identify throat cancer as the cause of death, Treadwell also suggests that it may have been lung cancer. It was &quot;traceable to his war service&quot;, and attributed to a gas attack. His funeral, with full military honours, was conducted at Woking crematorium. At his death his estate was valued at over £26,000.

&quot;Bulldog Drummond Hits Out&quot; was finished by Fairlie and had a short tour of Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, before opening in London at the Savoy Theatre on 21 December 1937. The story was later turned into a novel by Fairlie, with the title &quot;Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor&quot;. Fairlie continued to write Drummond novels, seven in total. When the Second World War broke out, Fairlie put Bulldog Drummond firmly in the anti-fascist camp, fighting for Britain.

Drummond, McNeile&#x27;s chief literary legacy, became a model for other literary heroes created in the 1940s and &#x27;50s. W. E. Johns used McNeile&#x27;s work as a model for his character Biggles, while Ian Fleming admitted that James Bond was &quot;Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below&quot;. Sydney Horler&#x27;s popular character &quot;Tiger&quot; Standish was also modelled on Drummond.

==Writing==

McNeile&#x27;s works fall into two distinct phases. Those works published between 1915 and 1918 are his war stories, and relate directly to his experiences during the First World War, while the later works are largely thrillers. His war stories were marketed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and Hodder &amp; Stoughton as a soldier&#x27;s eyewitness accounts. When he started writing thrillers, Hodder &amp; Stoughton advertised McNeile as a &quot;light and entertaining&quot; writer, and began publishing his works in the &quot;Yellow Jacket&quot; series.

===Style and technique===

McNeile&#x27;s early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either &quot;plot-driven adventure narrative[s]&quot;, such as the short stories &quot;The Song of the Bayonet&quot; and &quot;Private Meyrick, Company Idiot&quot;, or &quot;atmospheric vignette[s]&quot;, such as &quot;The Land of Topsy Turvy&quot; and &quot;The Human Touch&quot;. McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having &quot;little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clichéd and often repetitive&quot;; Richard Usborne agreed, adding that the female characters were &quot;cardboard&quot; and that McNeile was &quot;wonderfully forgetful&quot; about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies the central character as &quot;a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama&quot;. The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books &quot;make no claim to literary excellence&quot;, and are instead, &quot;good, solid thrillers&quot;. Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as middlebrow, with &quot;sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England&quot;. His early novels, particularly &quot;Bull-Dog Drummond&quot; and &quot;The Black Gang&quot;, were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile&#x27;s lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile &quot;mastered the tricks of his trade&quot;.

DelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as &quot;filthy, murdering Boche&quot;, and &quot;stinking, cowardly Bolshevik&quot;. She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin. Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word &quot;devil&quot;—and variations—when discussing antagonists.

===Major themes===

====First World War====
The major theme running throughout McNeile&#x27;s works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war, while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as &quot;both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake&quot;. His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a &quot;celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles&quot;. McNeile&#x27;s view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a &quot;valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered&quot;. The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in &quot;The Making of an Officer&quot;, his series of articles in &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he wrote about &quot;the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to &#x27;inspire&#x27; subalterns&quot;, a theme he returned to in his war stories—particularly &quot;The Lieutenant and Others&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E&quot;—and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.

McNeile&#x27;s fictional work—particularly his Drummond series of books—shows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it; Jaillant comments that Drummond&#x27;s war-time experience &quot;has shaped his social identity, his skills, and even his physical appearance&quot;. The Drummond character has been &quot;brutalized by war&quot;, which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others.

====England====

McNeile provided Drummond with a &quot;flamboyantly aggressive patriotism&quot; towards England, which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality. Bertens tried to argue that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes, of which Drummond was a member. Drummond&#x27;s nickname—Bulldog—is symbolic of England, and he and his English gentlemen friends—&quot;the Breed&quot;—fight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England&#x27;s stability. McNeile&#x27;s thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains.

====Sport====
Running throughout McNeile&#x27;s books is the metaphor of warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.&quot;, he writes, &quot;To bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans&quot;. The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: &quot;The Third Round&quot;, &quot;The Final Count&quot;, &quot;Knock-Out&quot; and &quot;Challenge&quot;.

===Reception===
McNeile&#x27;s war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.&quot;, were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year. His thrillers were also popular, with &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for &quot;best-sellers&quot;. At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £10,000 a year; the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; estimated that during his writing career he had earned £85,000.
McNeile&#x27;s war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing &quot;Men, Women, and Guns&quot; for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Francis Henry Gribble wrote that &quot;Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories ... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination.&quot; The reviewer of &quot;Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.&quot; for &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; reminded its readers that McNeile &quot;has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army.&quot; Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as &quot;a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness&quot;. When reviewing &quot;Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the critic observed that &quot;if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can&#x27;t go wrong on Bulldog Drummond&quot;; for the novel &quot;Bulldog Drummond at Bay&quot;, the reviewer considered that &quot;as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate&quot;. In the British market, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.

====Controversy====
From the 1950s on, McNeile&#x27;s work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were &quot;carrying the Führer-principle&quot;. DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel—&quot;The Black Gang&quot; (1922)—is when the fascist element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as &quot;simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen&quot;.

Throughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be &quot;intensely conservative by modern standards&quot;; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as Agatha Christie, &quot;exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti-Semitism of the period, McNeile&#x27;s go far beyond the &#x27;polite&#x27; norms&quot;. J. D. Bourn considers his language to be &quot;rather distasteful&quot;, while the academic Michael Denning observed that &quot;Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners&quot;.

<text>Royal Standard de Liège, commonly referred to as Standard Liège (; ; ) or simply Standard in Belgium, is a Belgian professional football club based in the city of Liège.

They are one of the most successful clubs in Belgium, having won the Belgian league on ten occasions, most recently in 2007–08 and 2008–09. They have been in the top flight without interruption since 1921, longer than any other Belgian side. They have also won eight Belgian Cups, and in 1981–82 they reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which they lost 2–1 against Barcelona.

Standard players are nicknamed &quot;les Rouches&quot; because of their red jerseys. The French word for red, &quot;rouge&quot;, when pronounced with a Liège accent, sounds like &quot;rouche&quot;.

In March 2022, Standard Liège was acquired by US-based private investment firm 777 Partners. In October 2024 it was announced that 777 partners were declared bankrupt by a London court, making the future ownership unclear. 

==History==

On the first day of school in September 1898, the pupils of Collège Saint-Servais in Liège started a football club, which they called Standard of Liège in reference to Standard Athletic Club of Paris. Standard, whose official name is Royal Standard Club of Liège, was based in Cointe and Grivegnée before settling permanently in 1909 in Sclessin, an industrial neighbourhood in Liège. Standard initially joined the Belgian First League in 1909 before returning to the lower leagues a few years later. The club then gained promotion back to the top division in 1921 and has never been relegated since.

Shortly after World War II, Roger Petit, a former player and team captain, became general secretary of the club. Petit worked alongside President Henrard Paul to establish Standard among the elite of Belgian football. In 1954, Standard won their first club trophy, the Belgian Cup, which was soon followed by a first national title in 1957–58.

At European level, in the 1960s, the club reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1961–62, falling to beaten finalists Real Madrid 0–6 on aggregate, and the same stage of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the year 1966–67, losing to eventual champions Bayern Munich. The 1960s and early 1970s brought much success to the club, as Standard won six Belgian First Division titles, two Belgian Cups and a League Cup.
Driven by the Austrian Ernst Happel, Standard won the Belgian Cup again in 1981. The following year, Raymond Goethals took control of the team. Playing by the &quot;Raymond Science&quot; philosophy of football, the club was twice the champions of Belgium, twice winners of the Belgian Supercup (in three appearances) and reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1982. Standard played against Barcelona in the final at the Camp Nou on 12 May 1982, losing the match 1–2 to the Spaniards.

In 1984, these exploits were tainted by the revelation of the . Just days before the match against Barcelona, to secure the championship of Belgium and guard against last minute injuries, Standard had approached Roland Janssen, the captain of Thor Waterschei, to ensure that Thor players threw the final game of the season. This scandal involved several players, including Eric Gerets, and coach Raymond Goethals, who fled to Portugal to escape suspension. In compensation the Standard players gave their game bonuses to the Waterschei players. Following the scandal, Standard was deprived of many of its playing staff due to long-term suspensions and it took the club several years to recover from the incident.

On 6 June 1993, Standard won the Belgian Cup for the fifth time in its history, defeating Robert Waseige&#x27;s Charleroi at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Brussels. This led to another appearance in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, ending in a record 10–0 aggregate defeat to Arsenal— having lost 3–0 at Highbury in London, Standard were humiliated 0–7 in the second leg at home.

Following the scandal of 1982, it took 25 years before Standard won the Belgium Championship again, lifting the title on 20 April 2008. The club won the Belgian league again the following year, securing the club&#x27;s tenth league title on 24 May 2009 after a home-and-away game against rivals Anderlecht. Standard won the national cup once more in 2011, defeating Westerlo 2–0 in the final at the King Baudouin Stadium on 21 May 2011. The club was bought by businessman Roland Duchatelet on 23 June 2011, who then took over English club Charlton in December 2013, creating an affiliation between the two clubs.

On 20 October 2014, Guy Luzon resigned as manager of Standard with the club sitting in 12th position in the Pro League standings and having taken only two points from three UEFA Europa League matches. Luzon later became head coach of Charlton. Assistant and former midfielder Ivan Vukomanović took over as caretaker-manager.

===Golden Shoe===
On nine occasions, Standard players have won the Belgian Golden Shoe as the best player in the domestic league. Jean Nicolay won the award in 1963, Wilfried Van Moer in 1969 and 1970, Christian Piot in 1972, Eric Gerets in 1982, Sérgio Conceição in 2005, Steven Defour in 2007, Axel Witsel in 2008 and Milan Jovanović in 2009.

== Rivalries ==
Standard Liège supporters share a fierce rivalry with RSC Anderlecht, dubbed the Belgian &quot;Clasico&quot;. The rivalry not only reflects the traditional geographical one between the two cities of Liège and Brussels, but also a class divide, with Anderlecht being perceived as the team of the bourgeois elite and Standard, based in an industrial district, as the workers club. The two teams were also the two most successful teams in Belgium for long periods until the emergence of Club Brugge. Many players have played for both clubs, most notably Standard title winning captain Steven Defour, who when returning to Sclessin under Anderlecht&#x27;s purple colours was greeted with a large &quot;tifo&quot; with his head decapitated.

Standard also has a traditional city derbies with RFC Seraing and RFC Liège. In recent years, they have also developed a rivalry with fellow Walloon club Sporting Charleroi, with several matches having been stopped due to crowd disturbances between the two sets of supporters.

Matches with Limburgish clubs Racing Genk and STVV also are characterised with heightened tensions. This is due to the proximity of Genk and Sint-Truiden with the city of Liège and the historical ties of the mining and steel industries of these regions in Belgium. The rivalry between Standard and Racing Genk was fueled by the events of 17 May 2011. In this title match Standard winger Mehdi Carcela was hit in the face with a tackle by Genk defender Chris Mavinga. Carcela lost consciousness and was subbed off. Mavinga was not sent off after his reckless intervention. Genk went on to win the title with 1–1 draw, but it left many Standard fans with a sour taste.
