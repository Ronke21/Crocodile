<text>Count Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich-Erevansky, Serene Prince of Warsaw ( – ) was a Russian military leader who was the &quot;namiestnik&quot; of Poland.

Paskevich is known for leading Russian forces in Poland during the November Uprising and for a series of leadership roles throughout the early and mid-19th century, such as the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, and the beginning phase of the Crimean War. In Russian history, he is remembered as a prominent military commander, rated on a par with Ivan Dibich-Zabalkansky, commander of the Russian armies during the same time.

Paskevich started as an officer during the Napoleonic Wars serving in the battles of Austerlitz and Borodino. After the war, he was a leader in the Russo-Persian War. He was made count of Yerevan in 1828. Afterwards, he became the &quot;namiestnik&quot; of Poland in 1831 after he crushed the Polish rebels in the November Uprising. He then helped crush the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. His last engagement was the Crimean War. Paskevich died in Warsaw in 1856.

He attained the rank of field marshal in the Russian army, and later in the Prussian and Austrian armies.

== Early life ==
Ivan Paskevich was born in Poltava on 19 May 1782. His father was of the Paskevich family of Zaporozhian Cossack gentry, while his mother was a Belarusian noblewoman. He was educated at the Page Corps, where his progress was rapid, and in 1800 received his commission in the Guards and was named aide-de-camp to the tsar.

== Early military career ==

=== Napoleonic Wars ===
His first active service was in 1805, in the auxiliary army sent to the assistance of Austria against France, when he took part in the Battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805, where Austrian – Russian troops were defeated by the French under Napoleon.

From 1807 to 1812, Ivan Paskevich was engaged in the campaigns against the Ottomans, and distinguished himself by many brilliant and daring exploits, being made a general officer in his thirtieth year. During the war with France in 1812–1814 he was in command of the 26th division of infantry, and he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. During and after Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia Paskevich was engaged in the battles of Borodino, Dresden, Leipzig, and Paris (1814).

Ivan Paskevich wrote a memoir of some of his experiences during the Napoleonic wars.

=== The 1820s and the Russo-Persian War ===

Before the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), then–Lieutenant General Paskevich was made commander of the 1st Guard Infantry. In the unit the brother of Tsar Alexander and future Tsar Nicholas I. This started a relationship that had the future Tsar calling Ivan Paskevich &quot;father-Commander&quot;.

On the outbreak of Russo-Persian War in 1826 he was appointed second in command, and, in the spring of the following year he replaced Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov as chief command. Under his leadership, the Erivan and Nakhichevan Khanates were conquered from the Persians. After the Persians unsuccessfully tried to recapture Echmiadzin and its surroundings, the tsar granted Paskevich the title of &quot;Erivanskii&quot; (&quot;Count of Yerevan/Erevan&quot;), a million rubles and a diamond-mounted sword for his services. The Russo-Turkish War immediately followed and he successfully led the eastern or Caucasus front. For this he was made a Field Marshal at the age of forty-seven. In 1830, he was engaged in the Caucasian War on the territory of present-day Dagestan. At the same time he appointed the high-ranking Muslim cleric Mir-Fatah-Agha from Iran as head of the recently established Caucasus Committee. Paskevich hoped that by the help of Mir-Fatah&#x27;s high stature in the Muslim community, he could make a very valuable contribution to the Russian consolidation of power in the Caucasus. Together with Mir-Fatah&#x27;s high esteem among Muslims and his devised plans for the Caucasus, they managed to keep the entire Caucasus stable from rebellious Muslim insurrections for many years to come.

== Polish uprising and the Hungarian Revolution ==
In June 1831, after the death of Field Marshal von Diebitsch, commander of Russian troops in Congress Poland, Paskevich was appointed his successor in crushing the Polish uprising. His armies, following the Battle of Ostrołęka in May, advanced slowly, but Paskevich redeemed his reputation at the Battle of Warsaw, giving a death blow to Polish hopes of restoring independence. He was created &quot;Prince of Warsaw&quot; and awarded the office of Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. With the kingdom&#x27;s autonomy limited by the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland, the period under Namestnik Paskevich – known in Poland as the &quot;&quot; – became infamous for political repressions and economic sanctions, as well as for Russification. It was a policy of administrative unification of the Kingdom of Poland with the Russian Empire. There he also promoted the development of industry, the construction of highways, railways and military fortresses. With Paskevich&#x27;s participation, a decree was prepared in 1846, which prohibited the arbitrary removal by landlords of peasants, who had more than 3 morgen (1.7 hectares), from the land, the reduction or change of their plots, and abolished (duties in favour of landlords over and above and ), forced hiring, tribute, and a number of other duties.

On the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 he was appointed to command the Russian troops sent to aid Austria, and finally compelled the Hungarians&#x27; surrender at Világos.

== Late career ==
In 1854 Paskevich took command of the Army of the Danube, which was then engaging the Turks in the initial stage of the conflict which evolved into the Crimean War. Though he laid siege to Silistria, Paskevich advocated aborting the campaign due to Austria&#x27;s threat to intervene in the war. On 9 June he suffered a combat injury and was compelled to return to Russia, handing command of the army to General Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov. Paskevich died in Warsaw, where in 1870 a memorial was erected to him before the Koniecpolski Palace. It was demolished in October 1917 by the Poles. His remains were reburied by his son in the family mausoleum on the grounds of the Homel Palace. Both Paskevich&#x27;s titles, Prince of Warsaw and Count of Erevan, went extinct with the death of his only son Lt. Gen. Fedor Paskevich in 1903.

<doc id="1002535" wikidata="Q1285985" url="?curid=1002535" title="Edmund Musgrave Barttelot">
<text>Edmund Musgrave Barttelot (28 March 1859 – 19 July 1888) was a British army officer, who became notorious after his allegedly brutal and deranged behaviour during his disastrous command of the rear column in the Congo during Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. He has often been identified as one of the sources for the character of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1899 novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.

==Life==
Barttelot was born in Petworth, West Sussex, the second son of Sir Walter Barttelot, 1st Baronet and his first wife, Harriet Musgrave. He attended Sandhurst before receiving a commission in the 7th Regiment of Foot on 22 January 1879 at the age of 19. Barttelot served in the British Raj before fighting in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and the Anglo–Egyptian War. During the Nile Expedition of 1884–85, he joined the Camel Corps on their march to Khartoum, and caused some controversy by shooting an Aden man who attempted to vandalise a waterskin and struck Barttelot with a stick. Barttelot was promoted to the rank of captain on 8 September 1886 before being brevetted Major the following day in recognition of his service in Sudan.

In 1886, he volunteered for Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. As Stanley&#x27;s second in command he was leader of the Rear Column which was left at Yambuya on the Aruwimi River to wait for more porters to be brought by the Arab slave trader Tippu Tip while Stanley marched on to reach Emin as soon as possible. During Stanley&#x27;s absence, the Rear Column descended into confusion. Barttelot was unable to maintain discipline, and resorted to repeated floggings of Africans, at least two of whom died from the beatings. Large numbers of bearers died from malnutrition and untreated illness or deserted. Although the Rear Column finally received some of the Manyema porters, it had only got as far as Banalya when the Major threatened a woman with his revolver because she was beating a drum during a ceremony in the early hours of the morning. He was shot dead by the woman&#x27;s husband, a man named Sanga or Samba.

Stanley received reports about Barttelot&#x27;s behaviour from other officers. One, William Bonny, said that &quot;the least thing caused the Major to behave like a fiend&quot; and that he would repeatedly stab African workers with a steel-pointed cane, bit a woman, and tried to poison an Arab chief. Bonny&#x27;s comments, however, have been regarded with scepticism by historians who have studied the expedition, on account of his habitual dishonesty, his doctoring of his old diary entries, and his opium addiction. Another officer, John Rose Troup, said that the Major &quot;had an intense hatred of anything in the shape of a black man&quot;. His 13-year-old &#x27;boy&#x27; named Sudi bin Bohati had been beaten and kicked by him. Stanley nursed the injured Sudi, who died six weeks after Stanley returned. Furious, Stanley mainly blamed Barttelot for the failure of the Rear Column, though he also criticised the other officers for allowing him to &quot;kick, strike and slay human beings&quot;. After being sewn into a blanket, Barttelot&#x27;s body was buried in the forest.

==Reputation==
After the return of expedition-members to Europe and America, Barttelot&#x27;s alleged abusive and incompetent behaviour was widely reported. In response, Barttelot&#x27;s brother, Walter George Barttelot edited the diaries of his brother, defending his reputation and adding some biting comments on Stanley&#x27;s behaviour.

Recent historians have generally accepted the negative assessment of Barttelot. Adam Hochschild wrote that after being left in charge of the Rear Column, 

Barttelot has been portrayed as a model for Kurtz in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. Jerry Allen considered him the principal historical model, though Harold Bloom argued that there was no single model, and that many of Kurtz&#x27;s actions were more likely to be based on Barttelot&#x27;s contemporary Tippu Tip. Hochschild also considers him a likely source, since he &quot;went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered&quot;, but also thinks that other participants in the expedition and contemporary figures contributed to the character.

He appears as a character in Simon Gray&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;The Rear Column&quot;, which tells the story of the men of the rear column left by Stanley to wait for Tippu Tip. He is portrayed as weak and unstable. Barttelot was played by Barry Foster in the original production and in the 1980 BBC television version.

<text>Freeze drying, also known as lyophilization or cryodesiccation, is a low temperature dehydration process that involves freezing the product and lowering pressure, thereby removing the ice by sublimation. This is in contrast to dehydration by most conventional methods that evaporate water using heat.

Because of the low temperature used in processing, the rehydrated product retains many of its original qualities. When solid objects like strawberries are freeze dried the original shape of the product is maintained. If the product to be dried is a liquid, as often seen in pharmaceutical applications, the properties of the final product are optimized by the combination of excipients (i.e., inactive ingredients). Primary applications of freeze drying include biological (e.g., bacteria and yeasts), biomedical (e.g., surgical transplants), food processing (e.g., coffee), and preservation.

== History ==
The Inca were freeze drying potatoes into chuño since the 13th century. The process involved multiple cycles of exposing potatoes to below freezing temperatures on mountain peaks in the Andes during the evening, and squeezing water out and drying them in the sunlight during the day. The Inca people also used the unique climate of the Altiplano to freeze dry meat.

The Japanese koya-dofu, freeze-dried tofu, dates to the mid-1500s in Nagano and the 1600s on Mount Koya.

Modern freeze drying began as early as 1890 by Richard Altmann who devised a method to freeze dry tissues (either plant or animal), but went virtually unnoticed until the 1930s. In 1909, L. F. Shackell independently created the vacuum chamber by using an electrical pump. No further freeze drying information was documented until Tival in 1927 and Elser in 1934 had patented freeze drying systems with improvements to freezing and condenser steps.

A significant turning point for freeze drying occurred during World War II when blood plasma and penicillin were needed to treat the wounded in the field. Because of the lack of refrigerated transport, many serum supplies spoiled before reaching their recipients. The freeze-drying process was developed as a commercial technique that enabled blood plasma and penicillin to be rendered chemically stable and viable without refrigeration. In the 1950s–1960s, freeze drying began to be viewed as a multi-purpose tool for both pharmaceuticals and food processing.

In 2020, freeze dried candy saw a major surge in popularity due to viral popularity on social media with freeze dried versions of popular candies such as Skittles, Nerd Gummy Clusters, and SweeTarts appearing in stores.

=== Early uses in food ===
Freeze-dried foods became a major component of astronaut and military rations. What began for astronaut crews as tubed meals and freeze-dried snacks that were difficult to rehydrate, were transformed into hot meals in space by improving the process of rehydrating freeze-dried meals with water. As technology and food processing improved, NASA looked for ways to provide a complete nutrient profile while reducing crumbs, disease-producing bacteria, and toxins. The complete nutrient profile was improved with the addition of an algae-based vegetable-like oil to add polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are beneficial in mental and vision development and, as they remain stable during space travel, can provide astronauts with added benefits. The crumb problem was solved with the addition of a gelatin coating on the foods to lock in and prevent crumbs. Disease-producing bacteria and toxins were reduced by quality control and the development of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan, which is widely used today to evaluate food material before, during, and after processing. With the combination of these three innovations, NASA could provide safe and wholesome foods to their crews from freeze-dried meals.

Military rations have also come a long way, from being served cured pork and corn meal to beefsteaks with mushroom gravy. How rations are chosen and developed are based on acceptance, nutrition, wholesomeness, producibility, cost, and sanitation. Additional requirements for rations include a minimum shelf life of three years, be deliverable by air, consumable in worldwide environments, and provide a complete nutritional profile. The new T-rations have been improved upon by increasing acceptable items and provide high quality meals while in the field. Freeze-dried coffee was also incorporated by replacing spray-dried coffee in the meal, ready-to-eat category.

==Stages of freeze drying==
There are four stages in the complete freeze drying process: pretreatment, freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying.

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment includes any method of treating the product prior to freezing. This may include concentrating the product, formulation revision (i.e., addition of components to increase stability, preserve appearance, and/or improve processing), decreasing a high-vapor-pressure solvent, or increasing the surface area. Food pieces are often IQF treated to make them free flowing prior to freeze drying. Freeze dried pharmaceutical products are in most cases parenterals administered after reconstitution by injection which need to be sterile as well as free of impurity particles. Pre-treatment in these cases consists of solution preparation followed by a multi-step filtration. Afterwards the liquid is filled under sterile conditions into the final containers which in production scale freeze dryers are loaded automatically to the shelves.

In many instances the decision to pretreat a product is based on theoretical knowledge of freeze-drying and its requirements, or is demanded by cycle time or product quality considerations.

===Freezing and annealing===
During the freezing stage, the material is cooled below its triple point, the temperature at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases of the material can coexist. This ensures that sublimation rather than melting will occur in the following steps. To facilitate faster and more efficient freeze drying, larger ice crystals are preferable. The large ice crystals form a network within the product which promotes faster removal of water vapor during sublimation. To produce larger crystals, the product should be frozen slowly or can be cycled up and down in temperature in a process called annealing. The freezing phase is the most critical in the whole freeze-drying process, as the freezing method can impact the speed of reconstitution, duration of freeze-drying cycle, product stability, and appropriate crystallization.

Amorphous materials do not have a eutectic point, but they do have a critical point, below which the product must be maintained to prevent melt-back or collapse during primary and secondary drying.

==== Structurally sensitive goods ====
In the case of goods where preservation of structure is required, like food or objects with formerly-living cells, large ice crystals break the cell walls, resulting in increasingly poor texture and loss of nutritive content. In this case, rapidly freezing the material to below its eutectic point avoids the formation of large ice crystals. Usually, the freezing temperatures are between and .

===Primary drying===
During the primary drying phase, the pressure is lowered (to the range of a few millibars), and enough heat is supplied to the material for the ice to sublimate. The amount of heat necessary can be calculated using the sublimating molecules&#x27; latent heat of sublimation. In this initial drying phase, about 95% of the water in the material is sublimated. This phase may be slow (can be several days in the industry), because, if too much heat is added, the material&#x27;s structure could be altered.

In this phase, pressure is controlled through the application of partial vacuum. The vacuum speeds up the sublimation, making it useful as a deliberate drying process. Furthermore, a cold condenser chamber and/or condenser plates provide a surface(s) for the water vapor to re-liquify and solidify on.

It is important to note that, in this range of pressure, the heat is brought mainly by conduction or radiation; the convection effect is negligible, due to the low air density.

===Secondary drying===

The secondary drying phase aims to remove unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed in the primary drying phase. This part of the freeze-drying process is governed by the material&#x27;s adsorption isotherms. In this phase, the temperature is raised higher than in the primary drying phase, and can even be above , to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of microbars, or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well.

After the freeze-drying process is complete, the vacuum is usually broken with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, before the material is sealed.

At the end of the operation, the final residual water content in the product is extremely low, around 1–4%.

== Applications of freeze drying ==
Freeze-drying causes less damage to the substance than other dehydration methods using higher temperatures. Nutrient factors that are sensitive to heat are lost less in the process as compared to the processes incorporating heat treatment for drying purposes. Freeze-drying does not usually cause shrinkage or toughening of the material being dried. In addition, flavors, smells, and nutritional content generally remain unchanged, making the process popular for preserving food. However, water is not the only chemical capable of sublimation, and the loss of other volatile compounds such as acetic acid (vinegar) and alcohols can yield undesirable results.

Freeze-dried products can be rehydrated (reconstituted) much more quickly and easily because the process leaves microscopic pores. The pores are created by the ice crystals that sublimate, leaving gaps or pores in their place. This is especially important when it comes to pharmaceutical uses. Freeze-drying can also be used to increase the shelf life of some pharmaceuticals for many years.

===Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology===

Pharmaceutical companies often use freeze-drying to increase the shelf life of the products, such as live virus vaccines, biologics, and other injectables. By removing the water from the material and sealing the material in a glass vial, the material can be easily stored, shipped, and later reconstituted to its original form for injection. Another example from the pharmaceutical industry is the use of freeze drying to produce tablets or wafers, the advantage of which is less excipient as well as a rapidly absorbed and easily administered dosage form.

Freeze-dried pharmaceutical products are produced as lyophilized powders for reconstitution in vials and more recently in prefilled syringes for self-administration by a patient.

Examples of lyophilized biological products include many vaccines such as live measles virus vaccine, typhoid vaccine, and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine groups A and C combined. Other freeze-dried biological products include antihemophilic factor VIII, interferon alfa, anti-blood clot medicine streptokinase, and wasp venom allergenic extract.

Many bio-pharmaceutical products based on therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies require lyophilization for stability. Examples of lyophilized biopharmaceuticals include blockbuster drugs such as etanercept (Enbrel by Amgen), infliximab (Remicade by Janssen Biotech), rituximab, and trastuzumab (Herceptin by Genentech).

Cell extracts that support cell-free biotechnology applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and biomanufacturing are also freeze-dried to improve stability under room temperature storage.

Dry powders of probiotics are often produced by bulk freeze-drying of live microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.

Lyophilized biologics can be pressed into pellets and tablets for anhydrous and high-density, solid-state storage of biological products.

=== Freeze drying of food ===


The primary purpose of freeze drying within the food industry is to extend the shelf-life of the food while maintaining the quality. Freeze-drying is known to result in the highest quality of foods of all drying techniques because structural integrity is maintained along with preservation of flavors. Because freeze drying is expensive, it is used mainly with high-value products. Examples of high-value freeze-dried products are seasonal fruits and vegetables because of their limited availability, coffee; and foods used for military rations, astronauts/cosmonauts, and/or hikers.

==== NASA and military rations ====
Because of its light weight per volume of reconstituted food, freeze-dried products are popular and convenient for hikers, as military rations, or astronaut meals. A greater amount of dried food can be carried compared to the same weight of wet food. In replacement of wet food, freeze dried food can easily be rehydrated with water if desired and shelf-life of the dried product is longer than fresh/wet product making it ideal for long trips taken by hikers, military personnel, or astronauts. The development of freeze drying increased meal and snack variety to include items like shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, butterscotch pudding, and apple sauce.

==== Coffee ====

Coffee contains flavor and aroma qualities that are created due to the Maillard reaction during roasting and can be preserved with freeze-drying. Compared to other drying methods like room temperature drying, hot-air drying, and solar drying, Robusta coffee beans that were freeze-dried contained higher amounts of essential amino acids like leucine, lysine, and phenylalanine. Also, few non-essential amino acids that significantly contributed to taste were preserved.

==== Fruits ====
With conventional dehydration, berries can degrade in quality as their structure is delicate and contains high levels of moisture. Strawberries were found to have the highest quality when freeze dried; retaining color, flavor, and ability to be re-hydrated.

==== Insects ====
Freeze-drying is used extensively to preserve insects for the purposes of consumption. Whole freeze-dried insects are sold as exotic pet food, bird feed, fish bait, and increasingly for human consumption. Powdered freeze-dried insects are used as a protein base in animal feeds, and in some markets, as a nutritional supplement for human use. Farmed insects are generally used for all of the aforementioned purposes versus harvesting wild insects, except in the case of grasshoppers which are often harvested out of field crops.

===Technological industry===
In chemical synthesis, products are often freeze-dried to make them more stable, or easier to dissolve in water for subsequent use.

In bioseparations, freeze-drying can be used also as a late-stage purification procedure, because it can effectively remove solvents. Furthermore, it is capable of concentrating substances with low molecular weights that are too small to be removed by a filtration membrane. Freeze-drying is a relatively expensive process. The equipment is about three times as expensive as the equipment used for other separation processes, and the high energy demands lead to high energy costs. Furthermore, freeze-drying also has a long process time, because the addition of too much heat to the material can cause melting or structural deformations. Therefore, freeze-drying is often reserved for materials that are heat-sensitive, such as proteins, enzymes, microorganisms, and blood plasma. The low operating temperature of the process leads to minimal damage of these heat-sensitive products.

In nanotechnology, freeze-drying is used for nanotube purification to avoid aggregation due to capillary forces during regular thermal vaporization drying.

=== Taxidermy ===
Freeze-drying is among the methods used to preserve animals in the field of taxidermy. When animals are preserved in this manner they are called &quot;freeze-dried taxidermy&quot; or &quot;freeze-dried mounts&quot;. Freeze-drying is commonly used to preserve crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and smaller mammals. Freeze-drying is also used as a means to memorialize pets after death. Rather than opting for a traditional skin mount when choosing to preserve their pet via taxidermy, many owners opt for freeze-drying because it is less invasive upon the pet&#x27;s body.

===Other uses===
Organizations such as the Document Conservation Laboratory at the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) have done studies on freeze-drying as a recovery method of water-damaged books and documents. While recovery is possible, restoration quality depends on the material of the documents. If a document is made of a variety of materials, which have different absorption properties, expansion will occur at a non-uniform rate, which could lead to deformations. Water can also cause mold to grow or make inks bleed. In these cases, freeze-drying may not be an effective restoration method.

In bacteriology freeze-drying is used to conserve special strains.

Advanced ceramics processes sometimes use freeze-drying to create a formable powder from a sprayed slurry mist. Freeze-drying creates softer particles with a more homogeneous chemical composition than traditional hot spray drying, but it is also more expensive.

A new form of burial which previously freeze-dries the body with liquid nitrogen has been developed by the Swedish company Promessa Organic AB, which puts it forward as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional casket and cremation burials.

== Advantages ==
Freeze-drying is viewed as the optimal method of choice for dehydration of food because of the preservation of quality, meaning characteristics of the food product such as aroma, rehydration, and bioactivity, are noticeably higher compared to foods dried using other techniques.

=== Shelf-life extension ===
Shelf-life extension results from low processing temperatures in conjunction with rapid transition of water through sublimation. With these processing conditions, deterioration reactions, including nonenzymic browning, enzymatic browning, and protein denaturation, are minimized. When the product is successfully dried, packaged properly, and placed in ideal storage conditions the foods have a shelf life of greater than 12 months.

=== Re-hydration ===
If a dried product cannot be easily or fully re-hydrated, it is considered to be of lower quality. Because if the final freeze dried product is porous, complete re-hydration can occur in the food. This signifies greater quality of the product and makes it ideal for ready-to-eat instant meals.

=== Effect on nutrients and sensory quality ===
Due to the low processing temperatures and the minimization of deterioration reactions, nutrients are retained and color is maintained. Freeze-dried fruit maintains its original shape and has a characteristic soft crispy texture.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Microbial growth ===
Since the main method of microbial decontamination for freeze drying is the low temperature dehydration process, spoilage organisms and pathogens resistant to these conditions can remain in the product. Although microbial growth is inhibited by the low moisture conditions, it can still survive in the food product. An example of this is a viral hepatitis A outbreak that occurred in the United States in 2016, associated with frozen strawberries. If the product is not properly packaged and/or stored, the product can absorb moisture, allowing the once inhibited pathogens to begin reproducing as well.

=== Cost ===
Freeze-drying costs about five times as much as conventional drying, so it is most suitable for products which increase in value with processing. Costs are also variable depending on the product, the packaging material, processing capacity, etc. The most energy-intensive step is sublimation.

=== Silicone oil leakage ===
Silicone oil is the common fluid that is used to heat or cool shelves in the freeze-dryer. The continuous heat/cool cycle can lead to a leakage of silicone oil at weak areas that connect the shelf and hose. This can contaminate the product leading to major losses of pharmaceuticals and food products. Hence, to avoid this issue, mass spectrometers are used to identify vapors released by silicone oil to immediately take corrective action and prevent contamination of the product.

=== Products ===
Mammalian cells generally do not survive freeze drying even though they still can be preserved.

==Equipment and types of freeze dryers==


There are many types of freeze-dryers available, however, they usually contain a few essential components. These are a vacuum chamber, shelves, process condenser, shelf-fluid system, refrigeration system, vacuum system, and control system.

=== Function of essential components ===

==== Chamber ====
The chamber is highly polished and contains insulation, internally. It is manufactured with stainless steel and contains multiple shelves for holding the product. A hydraulic or electric motor is in place to ensure the door is vacuum-tight when closed.

==== Process condenser ====
The process condenser consists of refrigerated coils or plates that can be external or internal to the chamber. During the drying process, the condenser traps water. For increased efficiency, the condenser temperature should be 20 °C (36 °F) less than the product during primary drying and have a defrosting mechanism to ensure that the maximum amount of water vapor in the air is condensed.

==== Shelf fluid ====
The amount of heat energy needed at times of the primary and secondary drying phase is regulated by an external heat exchanger. Usually, silicone oil is circulated around the system with a pump.

==== Refrigeration system ====
This system works to cool shelves and the process condenser by using compressors or liquid nitrogen, which will supply energy necessary for the product to freeze.

==== Vacuum system ====
During the drying process, a vacuum of 50–100 microbar is applied, by the vacuum system, to remove the solvent. A two-stage rotary vacuum pump is used, however, if the chamber is large then multiple pumps are needed. This system compresses non-condensable gases through the condenser.

==== Control system ====
Finally, the control system sets up controlled values for shelf temperature, pressure, and time that are dependent on the product and/or the process. The freeze-dryer can run for a few hours or days depending on the product.

=== Contact freeze dryers ===
Contact freeze dryers use contact (conduction) of the food with the heating element to supply the sublimation energy. This type of freeze dryer is a basic model that is simple to set up for sample analysis. One of the major ways contact freeze dryers heat is with shelf-like platforms contacting the samples. The shelves play a major role as they behave like heat exchangers at different times of the freeze-drying process. They are connected to a silicone oil system that will remove heat energy during freezing and provide energy during drying times.

Additionally, the shelf-fluid system works to provide specific temperatures to the shelves during drying by pumping a fluid (usually silicone oil) at low pressure. The downside to this type of freeze dryer is that the heat is only transferred from the heating element to the side of the sample immediately touching the heater. This problem can be minimized by maximizing the surface area of the sample touching the heating element by using a ribbed tray, slightly compressing the sample between two solid heated plates above and below, or compressing with a heated mesh from above and below.

=== Radiant freeze dryers ===
Radiant freeze dryers use infrared radiation to heat the sample in the tray. This type of heating allows for simple flat trays to be used as an infrared source can be located above the flat trays to radiate downwards onto the product. Infrared radiation heating allows for a uniform heating of the surface of the product, but has little capacity for penetration so it is used mostly with shallow trays and homogeneous sample matrices.

=== Microwave-assisted freeze dryers ===
Microwave-assisted freeze dryers utilize microwaves to allow for deeper penetration into the sample to expedite the sublimation and heating processes in freeze-drying. This method can be complicated to set up and run as the microwaves can create an electrical field capable of causing gases in the sample chamber to become plasma. This plasma could potentially burn the sample, so maintaining a microwave strength appropriate for the vacuum levels is imperative. The rate of sublimation in a product can affect the microwave impedance, in which power of the microwave must be changed accordingly.

<text> (abbreviated StuG) meaning &quot;assault gun&quot; was a series of armored fighting vehicles used by both the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; formations during the Second World War (1939–1945). The main StuGs were the StuG III and StuG IV based on the Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tank chassis respectively.

The more common of the two, the StuG III was developed in the late 1930s on the chassis of the Panzer III. It was initially designated &quot;StuG&quot; but with the development in 1943 of the StuG IV to make up for lost StuG III production, it was re-designated as &quot;StuG III&quot; to distinguish the two. Initially, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; intended to use StuGs as armored self-propelled infantry support guns, providing close fire-support to infantry by destroying bunkers, pillboxes and other entrenched positions. A secondary capability as an anti-tank weapon became more important as the war progressed.

Following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, a significant problem emerged: the main armament on the light tanks and the 37 mm gun of the anti-tank guns and the Panzer III were insufficient against the newer Soviet T-34 medium and KV-1 heavy tanks. A more powerful gun, the 7.5 cm Pak 40, then in development, did not fit in the turret of the Panzer III, Germany&#x27;s primary medium tank at the time. The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; found, however, that the turretless StuGs had enough room in the crew compartment to mount the 75 mm Pak 40, and modified StuGs duly appeared. The new model proved an effective tank destroyer. Not only was its main gun powerful enough to knock out the new Soviet tanks, but the Panzer III chassis on which it was based made it highly mobile and reliable, and the increased armor plating combined with its low silhouette made it a difficult vehicle to destroy. The StuG III became Nazi Germany&#x27;s most-produced armored fighting-vehicle during World War II, with some 10,000 examples manufactured.

The StuG vehicles operated primarily within the (&quot;self-propelled artillery&quot;), a branch of the .

== Development history ==

Following the defeat of the German Empire in World War I, military commanders from the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; began to consider how mobile armored artillery units could provide support to advancing infantry units. Colonel Erich von Manstein recommended the concept of infantry &quot;Begleitbatterien&quot; (escort batteries) to General Beck, chief of the general staff in 1935. Manstein theorized the vehicle would not be used as one uses a tank, but rather as an infantry support vehicle to destroy fortified objectives through direct fire. Its mission was to destroy prepared defensive works, pill boxes, machine gun emplacements and tanks. It was not intended to be used to exploit breakthroughs and drive into the enemy rear areas, as the &quot;Panzertruppen&quot; units were intended to do.

===StuG III===
Daimler-Benz AG was given the order to develop and produce such a weapon on June 15, 1936. They created five prototypes, based on the chassis of the Panzer III, which were not useful for combat operations but did prove valuable for training.

The first production units, the Sturmgeschütz III Ausf A, arrived in 1940 mounted with the short barreled 75 mm StuK 37L/24 gun and increased frontal hull armor (from 30 mm to 50 mm). The main armament, which had a limited lateral traverse, was mounted directly in a casemate-style hull. This created the lowest possible profile in order to reduce the vehicle&#x27;s height, making the StuG more difficult to hit and easier to protect in hull defilade.

== Combat use ==

In 1942 and 1943 the StuG was one of the most effective tracked fighting vehicles fielded by the belligerents, in terms of enemy vehicles destroyed. Over 10,000 StuGs were eventually produced. 

The omission of a regular tank turret made for simpler and more cost-effective production, enabling greater numbers to be built. However, the lack of a traverse movement in the gun meant the entire vehicle had to be turned left or right to acquire targets, which proved to be a significant weakness at times. The StuG was more successful in defensive roles, such as ambush, rather than as an offensive vehicle.

The lack of an internal light machine gun in early models left the StuG vulnerable to close-range infantry attack. A machine gun and shield were added to later versions. 

===StuG IV===
In November 1943, Alkett, GmbH, a major StuG III manufacturer, was bombed as part of the RAF campaign against Berlin, and Alkett&#x27;s StuG production declined from 255 StuG IIIs in October 1943, to just 24 vehicles in December. In a December 1943 conference, Hitler welcomed the suggestion of taking the StuG III superstructure and mounting it on a Panzer IV chassis to offset the loss of production of the StuG III. This restarted the Sturmgeschütz IV project, which had earlier been considered and rejected. The superstructure of the StuG III Ausf. G was mounted on a Panzer IV chassis 7. The Krupp plant, which did not produce Panzer IIIs, used the Panzer IV chassis with a modified StuG III superstructure, with a box compartment for the driver added. Combat weight was 23 tonnes, lighter than the 23.9 tonnes for the StuG III Ausf. G. On December 16–17, 1943, Hitler was shown the StuG IV, and approved it. To make up for the large deficit in StuG III production, StuG IV production received full support.

=== Broadened use ===
Because of the decreased costs and ease of production, the Germans began to use the StuGs to replace standard tank losses. They were used in this fashion as German losses of all types of armored vehicles now exceeded production. The StuGs proved effective in a defensive role, but were a poor substitute for conventional tanks offensively. Thus the panzer regiments continued to be equipped with Panzer IV and Panther medium tanks for offensive operations. Meanwhile, heavier armed tank destroyers were developed, such as the Jagdpanzer IV and the Jagdpanther, which combined the low silhouette of the StuG with the heavier armament of the Panther and Tiger II tanks, respectively. Still, the StuG III was an effective armored fighting vehicle long after the Panzer III had been retired as a main battle tank.

=== Post-war use ===
A number of captured StuGs were refurbished in the Soviet Union and given to Syria, along with some Panzer IVs, where they were used briefly against Israel. A captured Syrian Panzer IV and StuG III are on display at the Armor Museum in Israel. The StuG was also used in Finland post-war where one unit even mixed StuGs and British turreted &#x27;Charioteer&#x27; tank destroyers. A Finnish StuG (posing as a German one) appears in the movie &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;, and ex-Finnish StuGs have since turned up in British war museums. The Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset has one painted in Finnish markings. The Imperial War Museum&#x27;s Duxford site also has an ex-Finland StuG but its markings are more ambiguous.

Another StuG III, in the possession of The Wheatcroft Collection, is awaiting restoration.

<text>Witte van Haemstede (–1321) was a bastard son of Floris V, Count of Holland, famous for military prowess.

== Family ==
Witte&#x27;s half-brother John I, Count of Holland, gave him the property connected to Haamstede Castle, in Zeeland.

== Battle at the Manpad ==
In 1304 Witte led an army to victory in a battle against the Flemish, who were threatening the city of Haarlem. He is said to have defeated the Flemish near Heemstede with the help of the Haarlemmers at the site of the &quot;Manpad&quot;.

In 1817 Mr. David Jacob van Lennep, who lived in the stately house called Huis te Manpad next to the Manpad, encouraged the Heemstede council to erect a monument. Van Lennep had already composed a romantic song about Witte van Haemstede that was quite popular. The legend says that Witte van Haemstede arrived by ship at Zandvoort and traveled overland to Haarlem over the Manpad, to help the Haarlemmers in their battle against the Flemish who had traveled overland from Hillegom and Lisse. This monument is called &#x27;De Naald&#x27; (&quot;The Needle&quot;).

== Offspring ==
Witte married Agnes van der Sluys, in or before 1307. Their descendants were the Lords of Haamstede. Witte had three sons:
* Floris I van Haamstede (1301-1345)
* Arnoud
* Jan

<doc id="1002551" wikidata="Q18407944" url="?curid=1002551" title="Flap (aeronautics)">
<text>A flap is a high-lift device used to reduce the stalling speed of an aircraft wing at a given weight. Flaps are usually mounted on the wing trailing edges of a fixed-wing aircraft. Flaps are used to reduce the take-off distance and the landing distance. Flaps also cause an increase in drag so they are retracted when not needed.

The flaps installed on most aircraft are partial-span flaps; spanwise from near the wing root to the inboard end of the ailerons. When partial-span flaps are extended they alter the spanwise lift distribution on the wing by causing the inboard half of the wing to supply an increased proportion of the lift, and the outboard half to supply a reduced proportion of the lift. Reducing the proportion of the lift supplied by the outboard half of the wing is accompanied by a reduction in the angle of attack on the outboard half. This is beneficial because it increases the margin above the stall of the outboard half, maintaining aileron effectiveness and reducing the likelihood of asymmetric stall, and spinning. The ideal lift distribution across a wing is elliptical, and extending partial-span flaps causes a significant departure from the elliptical. This increases lift-induced drag which can be beneficial during approach and landing because it allows the aircraft to descend at a steeper angle.

Extending the wing flaps increases the camber or curvature of the wing, raising the maximum lift coefficient or the upper limit to the lift a wing can generate. This allows the aircraft to generate the required lift at a lower speed, reducing the minimum speed (known as stall speed) at which the aircraft will safely maintain flight. For most aircraft configurations, a useful side effect of flap deployment is a decrease in aircraft pitch angle which lowers the nose thereby improving the pilot&#x27;s view of the runway over the nose of the aircraft during landing.

There are many different designs of flaps, with the specific choice depending on the size, speed and complexity of the aircraft on which they are to be used, as well as the era in which the aircraft was designed. Plain flaps, slotted flaps, and Fowler flaps are the most common. Krueger flaps are positioned on the leading edge of the wings and are used on many jet airliners. The Fowler, Fairey-Youngman and Gouge types of flap increase the wing area in addition to changing the camber. The larger lifting surface reduces wing loading, hence further reducing the stalling speed.

Some flaps are fitted elsewhere. Leading-edge flaps form the wing leading edge and when deployed they rotate down to increase the wing camber. The de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer had flaps running beneath the fuselage and forward of the wing trailing edge. Many of the Waco Custom Cabin series biplanes have the flaps at mid-chord on the underside of the top wing.

==Principles of operation==
The general airplane lift equation demonstrates these relationships:
:formula_1

where:
* &quot;L&quot; is the amount of &quot;Lift&quot; produced,
* &quot;formula_2&quot; is the air density,
* &quot;V&quot; is the true airspeed of the airplane or the &quot;Velocity&quot; of the airplane, relative to the air
* S is the area of the wing
* formula_3 is the &quot;lift coefficient&quot;, which is determined by the shape of the airfoil used and the angle at which the wing meets the air (or angle of attack).

Here, it can be seen that increasing the area (S) and lift coefficient (formula_3) allow a similar amount of lift to be generated at a lower airspeed (V). Thus, flaps are extensively in use for short takeoffs and landings (STOL).
Extending the flaps also increases the drag coefficient of the aircraft. Therefore, for any given weight and airspeed, flaps increase the drag force. Flaps increase the drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with flaps extended. Some flaps increase the wing area and, for any given speed, this also increases the parasitic drag component of total drag.

=== Flaps during takeoff ===
Depending on the aircraft type, flaps may be partially extended for takeoff. When used during takeoff, flaps trade runway distance for climb rate: using flaps reduces ground roll but also reduces the climb rate. The amount of flap used on takeoff is specific to each type of aircraft, and the manufacturer will suggest limits and may indicate the reduction in climb rate to be expected. The &quot;Cessna 172S Pilot Operating Handbook&quot; recommends 10° of flaps on takeoff, when the ground is soft or it is a short runway, otherwise 0 degrees is used.

=== Flaps during landing ===
Flaps may be fully extended for landing to give the aircraft a lower stall speed so the approach to landing can be flown more slowly, which also allows the aircraft to land in a shorter distance. The higher lift and drag associated with fully extended flaps allows a steeper and slower approach to the landing site, but imposes handling difficulties in aircraft with very low wing loading (i.e. having little weight and a large wing area). Winds across the line of flight, known as &quot;crosswinds&quot;, cause the windward side of the aircraft to generate more lift and drag, causing the aircraft to roll, yaw and pitch off its intended flight path, and as a result many light aircraft land with reduced flap settings in crosswinds. Furthermore, once the aircraft is on the ground, the flaps may decrease the effectiveness of the brakes since the wing is still generating lift and preventing the entire weight of the aircraft from resting on the tires, thus increasing stopping distance, particularly in wet or icy conditions. Usually, the pilot will raise the flaps as soon as possible to prevent this from occurring.

=== Maneuvering flaps ===
Some gliders not only use flaps when landing, but also in flight to optimize the camber of the wing for the chosen speed. While thermalling, flaps may be partially extended to reduce the stall speed so that the glider can be flown more slowly and thereby reduce the rate of sink, which lets the glider use the rising air of the thermal more efficiently, and to turn in a smaller circle to make best use of the core of the thermal. At higher speeds a negative flap setting is used to reduce the nose-down pitching moment. This reduces the balancing load required on the horizontal stabilizer, which in turn reduces the trim drag associated with keeping the glider in longitudinal trim. Negative flap may also be used during the initial stage of an aerotow launch and at the end of the landing run in order to maintain better control by the ailerons.

Like gliders, some fighters such as the Nakajima Ki-43 also use special flaps to improve maneuverability during air combat, allowing the fighter to create more lift at a given speed, allowing for much tighter turns. The flaps used for this must be designed specifically to handle the greater stresses and most flaps have a maximum speed at which they can be deployed. Control line model aircraft built for precision aerobatics competition usually have a type of maneuvering flap system that moves them in an opposing direction to the elevators, to assist in tightening the radius of a maneuver.

=== Flap tracks ===
Manufactured most often from PH steels and titanium, flap tracks control the flaps located on the trailing edge of an aircraft&#x27;s wings. Extending flaps often run on guide tracks. Where these run outside the wing structure they may be faired in to streamline them and protect them from damage. Some flap track fairings are designed to act as anti-shock bodies, which reduce drag caused by local sonic shock waves where the airflow becomes transonic at high speeds.

===Thrust gates===
Thrust gates, or gaps, in the trailing edge flaps may be required to minimise interference between the engine flow and deployed flaps. In the absence of an inboard aileron, which provides a gap in many flap installations, a modified flap section may be needed. The thrust gate on the Boeing 757 was provided by a single-slotted flap in between the inboard and outboard double-slotted flaps. The A320, A330, A340 and A380 have no inboard aileron. No thrust gate is required in the continuous, single-slotted flap. Interference in the go-around case while the flaps are still fully deployed can cause increased drag which must not compromise the climb gradient.

==Types of flap==
=== Plain flap ===
The rear portion of airfoil rotates downwards on a simple hinge mounted at the front of the flap. The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft. In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps. These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons. Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917. Owing to the greater efficiency of other flap types, the plain flap is normally only used where simplicity is required. 

=== Split flap ===
The rear portion of the lower surface of the airfoil hinges downwards from the leading edge of the flap, while the upper surface stays immobile. This can cause large changes in longitudinal trim, pitching the nose either down or up. At full deflection, a split flaps acts much like a spoiler, adding significantly to drag coefficient. It also adds a little to lift coefficient. It was invented by Orville Wright and James M. H. Jacobs in 1920, but only became common in the 1930s and was then quickly superseded. The Douglas DC-1 (progenitor to the DC-3 and C-47) was one of the first of many aircraft types to use split flaps.

=== Slotted flap ===
A gap between the flap and the wing forces high pressure air from below the wing over the flap helping the airflow remain attached to the flap, increasing lift compared to a split flap. Additionally, lift across the entire chord of the primary airfoil is greatly increased as the velocity of air leaving its trailing edge is raised, from the typical non-flap 80% of freestream, to that of the higher-speed, lower-pressure air flowing around the leading edge of the slotted flap. Any flap that allows air to pass between the wing and the flap is considered a slotted flap. The slotted flap was a result of research at Handley-Page, a variant of the slot that dates from the 1920s, but was not widely used until much later. Some flaps use multiple slots to further boost the effect.

=== Fowler flap ===
A split flap that slides backwards, before hinging downward, thereby increasing first chord, then camber. The flap may form part of the upper surface of the wing, like a plain flap, or it may not, like a split flap, but it must slide rearward before lowering. As a defining feature – distinguishing it from the Gouge Flap – it always provides a slot effect. 

The flap was invented by Harlan D. Fowler in 1924, and tested by Fred Weick at NACA in 1932. First used on the Martin 146 prototype in 1935, it entered production on the 1937 Lockheed Super Electra, and remains in widespread use on modern aircraft, often with multiple slots.

===Junkers flap===
A slotted plain flap fixed below the trailing edge of the wing, and rotating about its forward edge. When not in use, it has more drag than other types, but is more effective at creating additional lift than a plain or split flap, while retaining their mechanical simplicity. Invented by Otto Mader at Junkers in the late 1920s, they were most often seen on the Junkers Ju 52 and the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;, though the same basic design can also be found on many modern ultralights, like the Denney Kitfox. This type of flap is sometimes referred to as an external-airfoil flap.

===Gouge flap===

A type of split flap that slides backward along curved tracks that force the trailing edge downward, increasing chord and camber without affecting trim or requiring any additional mechanisms. It was invented by Arthur Gouge for Short Brothers in 1936 and used on the Short Empire and Sunderland flying boats, which used the very thick Shorts A.D.5 airfoil. Short Brothers may have been the only company to use this type.

=== Fairey-Youngman flap ===
Drops down (becoming a Junkers Flap) before sliding aft and then rotating up or down. Fairey was one of the few exponents of this design, which was used on the Fairey Firefly and Fairey Barracuda. When in the extended position, it could be angled up (to a negative angle of incidence) so that the aircraft could be dived vertically without needing excessive trim changes.

=== Zap flap ===
The Zap flap was invented by Edward F. Zaparka while he was with Berliner/Joyce and tested on a General Airplanes Corporation Aristocrat in 1932 and on other types periodically thereafter, but it saw little use on production aircraft other than on the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. The leading edge of the flap is mounted on a track, while a point at mid chord on the flap is connected via an arm to a pivot just above the track. When the flap&#x27;s leading edge moves aft along the track, the triangle formed by the track, the shaft and the surface of the flap (fixed at the pivot) gets narrower and deeper, forcing the flap down.

===Krueger flap===

A hinged flap which folds out from under the wing&#x27;s leading edge while not forming a part of the leading edge of the wing when retracted. This increases the camber and thickness of the wing, which in turn increases lift and drag. This is not the same as a leading edge droop flap, as that is formed from the entire leading edge. Invented by Werner Krüger in 1943 and evaluated in Goettingen, Krueger flaps are found on many modern swept wing airliners.

===Gurney flap===

A small fixed perpendicular tab of between 1 and 2% of the wing chord, mounted on the high pressure side of the trailing edge of an airfoil. It was named for racing car driver Dan Gurney who rediscovered it in 1971, and has since been used on some helicopters such as the Sikorsky S-76B to correct control problems without having to resort to a major redesign. It boosts the efficiency of even basic theoretical airfoils (made up of a triangle and a circle overlapped) to the equivalent of a conventional airfoil. The principle was discovered in the 1930s, but was rarely used and was then forgotten. Late marks of the Supermarine Spitfire used a bead on the trailing edge of the elevators, which functioned in a similar manner.

=== Leading edge flap ===
The entire leading edge of the wing rotates downward, effectively increasing camber and also slightly reducing chord. Most commonly found on fighters with very thin wings unsuited to other leading edge high lift devices. Slats are one of such devices, Slats are extendable high lift devices on the leading edge of the wings of some fixed wing aircraft. Their purpose is to increase lift during low speed operations such as take-off, initial climb, approach and landing.

===Blown flap===

A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust over the flaps to increase lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed air from the engine over the top of the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust over the top of the wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps was not until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.

===Flexible flap===

Also known as the FlexFoil. A modern interpretation of wing warping, internal mechanical actuators bend a lattice that changes the airfoil shape. It may have a flexible gap seal at the transition between fixed and flexible airfoils.

===Flaperon===

A type of aircraft control surface that combines the functions of both flaps and ailerons.

=== Continuous trailing-edge flap ===
As of 2014, U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) researchers at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center developed an active-flap design for helicopter rotor blades. The Continuous Trailing-Edge Flap (CTEF) uses components to change blade camber during flight, eliminating mechanical hinges in order to improve system reliability. Prototypes were constructed for wind-tunnel testing.

A team from ARL completed a live-fire test of a rotor blade with individual blade control technology in January 2016. The live fire experiments explored the ballistic vulnerability of blade control technologies. Researchers fired three shots representative of typical ground fire on a 7-foot-span, 10-inch-chord rotor blade section with a 4-foot-long CTEF at ARL&#x27;s Airbase Experimental Facility.

===Related devices===
* Leading edge slats and slots are mounted on the top of the wings&#x27; leading edge and while they may be either fixed or retractable, when deployed they provide a slot or gap under the slat to force air against the top of the wing, which is absent on a Krueger flap. They offer excellent lift and enhance controllability at low speeds. Leading edge slats allow the wing to fly at a higher angle of attack which decrease takeoff and landing distances. Other types of flaps may be equipped with one or more slots to increase their effectiveness, a typical setup on many modern airliners. These are known as slotted flaps as described above. Frederick Handley Page experimented with fore and aft slot designs in the 20s and 30s.
* Spoilers are intended to create drag and reduce lift by &quot;spoiling&quot; the airflow over the wing. A spoiler is much larger than a Gurney flap, and can be retracted. Spoilers are usually installed mid chord on the upper surface of the wing, but may also be installed on the lower surface of the wing as well.
* Air brakes are used to increase drag, allowing the aircraft to decelerate rapidly. When installed on the wings they differ from flaps and spoilers in that they are not intended to modify the lift and are built strongly enough to be deployed at much higher speeds.
* Ailerons are similar to flaps (and work the same way), but are intended to provide lateral control, rather than to change the lifting characteristics of both wings together, and so operate differentially – when an aileron on one wing increases the lift, the opposite aileron does not, and will often work to decrease lift. When ailerons are designed to lower in conjunction with flaps, they are usually called flaperons, while those that spoil lift (typically placed on the upper surface before the trailing edge) they are called spoilerons.

<text>Fat Les was a British band consisting of Blur bassist Alex James, actor Keith Allen, and artist Damien Hirst. Vocals on their singles were provided by Keith Allen (all), Alex James (&quot;Vindaloo&quot;), Keith&#x27;s daughter Lily Allen (&quot;Who Invented Fish &amp; Chips?&quot;), Andy Kane (&quot;Who Invented Fish &amp; Chips?&quot;), Lisa Moorish (&quot;Naughty Christmas (Goblin in the Office)&quot;) and various choirs (&quot;Jerusalem&quot;).

==Background==
James and Hirst first knew each other when they were students at Goldsmiths College, but became friendly when they and Allen met at the Groucho Club. In May 1998, while discussing the forthcoming FIFA World Cup, Allen and James had the idea of creating an unofficial World Cup song, and formed Fat Les (named after a woman they knew). They were later joined by Hirst when they asked him to create artwork for them. Fat Les created the unofficial England national football anthem &quot;Vindaloo&quot; with Guy Pratt and then brought in the singer Andy Kane. The song reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. In the music video, the three band members featured alongside Paul Kaye, Rowland Rivron, Ed Tudor-Pole, Matt Lucas and David Walliams, and appearances by Allen&#x27;s children Lily and Alfie.

Later in 1998, they recorded &quot;Naughty Christmas (Goblin In The Office)&quot;, described as the &#x27;Official Christmas Record&#x27;, together with Joe Strummer on guitar, Rivron on drums, as well as Matt Lucas and Paul Kaye, and features vocals by Lisa Moorish with Lily Allen in the background. Fat Les also starred in a comedy show with Kaye, Lucas and John Thomson in &quot;You Are Here&quot; broadcast on Channel 4 on 30 December 1998.

In 2000, Fat Les recorded an official theme for the England football team at Euro 2000 tournament held in Belgium and the Netherlands, with a rendition of the hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. It was again fronted by Allen, with Michael Barrymore making an appearance. The track was credited to Fat Les 2000. According to Allen, in choosing the hymn he wanted to &quot;crystallise some kind of English culture&quot; and to reclaim it from the Right. The song was recorded at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios at a cost of £50,000 with a full orchestra and four choirs: the London Community Gospel Choir, New London Children&#x27;s Choir, Syncopeters and London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus.

For the 2002 World Cup, they recorded &quot;Who Invented Fish and Chips&quot;, which features Lily Allen in her first credited recording and video.

In 2012, Fat Les changed their name to &quot;Fit Les&quot; and recorded &quot;The Official Fit Les Olympic Anthem&quot;. Alex James left the group while Rowetta of Happy Mondays fame joined the lineup along with producer Matt Eaton.

<doc id="1002559" wikidata="Q121791" url="?curid=1002559" title="Asian giant hornet">
<text>The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), also known as the northern giant hornet, and the Japanese giant hornet, is the world&#x27;s largest hornet. It is native to temperate and tropical East Asia, South Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and parts of the Russian Far East. It was also found in the Pacific Northwest of North America in late 2019 with a few more additional sightings in 2020, and nests found in 2021, prompting concern that it could become an invasive species, but in December 2024, it was announced that the hornets had been eradicated from the region as well as from the rest of the United States.

Asian giant hornets prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotten pine roots. It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies. The hornet has a body length of , a wingspan around , and a stinger long, which injects a large amount of potent venom.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is a species in the genus &quot;Vespa&quot;, which comprises all true hornets. Along with seven other species, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is a part of the &quot;V. tropica&quot; species group, defined by the single notch located on the apical margin of the seventh gastral sternum of the male. The most closely related species within the species group is &quot;V. soror&quot;. The triangular shape of the apical margin of the clypeus of the female is diagnostic, the vertex of both species is enlarged, and the shape of the apex of the aedeagus is distinct and similar.

Division of the genus into subgenera has been attempted in the past, but has been abandoned, due to the anatomical similarity among species and because behavioral similarity is not associated with phylogeny. The species has existed since the Miocene epoch, as indicated by fossils found in the Shanwang Formation.

As of 2012, three subspecies were recognized: &quot;V. m. mandarinia&quot;, &quot;V. m. magnifica&quot;, and &quot;V. m. nobilis&quot;. The former subspecies referred to as &quot;V. m. japonica&quot; has not been considered valid since 1997. The most recent revision in 2020 eliminated all of the subspecies rankings entirely, with &quot;japonica&quot;, &quot;magnifica&quot;, and &quot;nobilis&quot; now relegated to informal non-taxonomic names for different color forms.

== Common names ==
Since its discovery in North America, the scientific literature and official government sources refer to this species by its established common name, Asian giant hornet, whilst the mainstream media have taken to using the nickname &quot;murder hornet&quot;. In July 2022, the Entomological Society of America stated that they will adopt the common name &quot;northern giant hornet&quot; for the species to avoid potentially discriminatory language, citing xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Regardless of sex, the hornet&#x27;s head is a light shade of orange and its antennae are brown with a yellow-orange base. Its eyes and ocelli are dark brown to black. &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is distinguished from other hornets by its pronounced clypeus and large genae. Its orange mandible contains a black tooth that it uses for digging. The thorax is dark brown, with two grey wings varying in span from .

Its forelegs are brighter than the mid and hind legs. The base of the forelegs is darker than the rest. The abdomen alternates between bands of dark brown or black, and a yellow-orange hue (consistent with its head color). The sixth segment is yellow. Its stinger is typically long and delivers a potent venom that, in cases of multiple hornets stinging simultaneously, or by rare allergic reaction, can kill a human.

===Queens and workers===
The queens are considerably larger than workers. Queens can exceed , while workers are between . The reproductive anatomy is consistent between the two, but workers do not reproduce.

===Drones===
Drones (males) are similar to females, and can attain in length, but lack stingers. This is a consistent feature among the Hymenoptera.

===Larvae===
Larvae spin a silk cocoon when they complete development and are ready to pupate. Larval silk proteins have a wide variety of potential applications due to their wide variety of potential morphologies, including the native fiber form, but also sponge, film, and gel.

=== Genome ===
The mitochondrial genome is provided by Chen &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015. This data has also been important to confirm the place of the wider Vespidae family in the Vespoidea superfamily, and confirms that Vespoidea is monophyletic.

==Misidentifications==
Within two days of the initial 2020 news report on &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;, insect identification centers in the eastern United States (where the wasp does not occur) began getting identification requests, and were swamped for the next several months, even though not one of the thousands of submitted photos or samples was of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;, but were instead primarily wasps such as the European hornet (&quot;V. crabro&quot;), the eastern cicada killer (&quot;Sphecius speciosus&quot;), or the southern yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula squamosa&quot;).

Submissions suspected by laypeople to be &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; also include other wasps of various sizes, bees, sawflies, horntails, wasp-mimicking flies, beetles, Jerusalem crickets, cicadas, and even a plastic children&#x27;s toy that was wasp-like in appearance, all of which were routinely estimated to be 130-185% of their actual size.

Reports of this species from other parts of the world appear to be erroneous identifications of other introduced hornet species, such as &quot;V. orientalis&quot; in several locations around the world, and &quot;V. velutina&quot; in Europe.

==Distribution==

===Ecological distribution===
&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is primarily a forest dweller. When it does live in urban landscapes, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is highly associated with green space. It is the most dependent upon green space of the &quot;Vespa&quot; species (with &quot;V. analis&quot; the least). Extremely urbanized areas provide a refuge for &quot;V. analis&quot;, whereas &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; – its predator – is entirely absent.

===Geographic distribution===
====Asia====
The Asian giant hornet can be found in:

* Russia – Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai (southern part only), and Jewish Autonomous Oblast region
* Korea (where it is called (Jaŋsumalbôl) &quot;general giant wasp, general hornet&quot;)
* Mainland China
* Taiwan ()
* Laos
* Thailand
* Cambodia
* Myanmar
* Vietnam
* Nepal
* India
* Bhutan
* Sri Lanka
* Malaysia
* Japan – It is common in Japan. It prefers rural areas where it can find trees in which to nest, and is known as the . At least as early as 2008, some popular and sensationalist media outlets in Japan also began referring to this wasp as .

====North America====
The first confirmed sightings of the Asian giant hornet in North America were confirmed in 2019 and were mainly concentrated in the Vancouver area, with nests also discovered in neighboring Whatcom County, Washington, in the United States.

* In August 2019, three hornets were found in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, and a large nest was found and destroyed shortly thereafter;
* At the end of September, a worker was reported in Blaine, Washington.
* Another worker was found in Blaine in October;
* In December 2019, another worker was found in Blaine;
* Two specimens were collected in May 2020, one from Langley, British Columbia, about north of Blaine, and one from Custer, Washington, southeast of Blaine.
* One queen sighting in June 2020, from Bellingham, Washington, south of Custer
* An unmated queen was trapped in July 2020, near Birch Bay, Washington, west of Custer.
* A male hornet was captured in Custer, Washington in July 2020.
* A hornet of unknown caste was reported in August 2020, in Birch Bay, and another was trapped in the same area the following day.
* Three hornets were seen (and two killed) southeast of Blaine on 21 and 25 September 2020, and three more were found in the same area on 29 and 30 September, prompting officials to report that attempts were underway to pinpoint and destroy a nest believed to be in the area.
* In October 2020, the Washington State Department of Agriculture announced that a nest was found above ground in a cavity of a tree in Blaine, with dozens of hornets entering and leaving. The nest was eradicated the next day, including the immediate discovery and removal of about 100 hornets. At first the owner of the land required the nest to be returned, and he advertised it for sale. A local beekeeper bought it from him and gave it back to the state entomology team. After further analysis, it was determined that the nest had contained about 500 live specimens, including about 200 queens. Some of these specimens were sent to the Smithsonian Institution to become a part of the NMNH Biorepository permanent cryogenic collection. It was announced that several undiscovered live nests were also believed to exist within Washington State, because the captures of individual hornets in Birch, Blaine, and Custer were all relatively far from the discovered nest. However, officials expressed cautious optimism, adding that it might still be possible to eradicate the hornets before they became established in the area. A Canadian official said that although individual specimens had been found in Canada and some nests were suspected to exist there, the hornets&#x27; presence seemed to be only in areas near the US-Canadian border, while the center of the invasion appeared to be in Washington State.
* In November 2020, one individual was found in Abbotsford, BC. As a result the BC government asked Abbotsford beekeepers and residents to report any sightings.
* In November 2020, a queen was found in Aldergrove, BC.
* In August 2021, a nest was discovered in Whatcom County, Washington near Blaine, only from the nest WSDA eradicated in 2020. This nest was destroyed two weeks later on 25 August, before it could produce new queens.
* In September 2021, two more nests were found near Blaine, in the vicinity of the nest found in August, and a &quot;potential sighting&quot; was reported from near Everson, some 25 miles east of Blaine.

A mitochondrial DNA analysis was performed to determine the maternal population(s) ancestral to the British Columbia and Washington introduced populations. The high dissimilarity between these two was similar to the mutual distances between each of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean native populations suggesting the specimens collected in 2019 were from two different maternal populations, Japanese in BC and South Korean in Washington. This suggests that two separate introductions of the Asian giant hornet occurred in North America within about of one another within a few months.

In April 2020, authorities in Washington State asked members of the public to be alert and report any sightings of these hornets, which are expected to become active in April if they are in the area. If they become established, the hornets &quot;could decimate bee populations in the United States and establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost.&quot; A &quot;full-scale hunt&quot; for the species by the WSDA was then underway. Two assessment models of their potential to spread from their present location on the US–Canadian border suggested that they could spread northward into coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska, and southward as far as southern Oregon. The USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service is engaged in lure/attractant development and molecular genetics research, both as part of its normal research mission, but also to further the near-term eradication goal in Washington.

In 2020, the United States Congress considered specific legislation to eradicate &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; including a proposal by the Interior Secretary, the Fish and Wildlife Director, and the other relevant agencies, which has been introduced as an amendment to the appropriations omnibus. British Columbia Agriculture is prepared for a &quot;long fight&quot; lasting years, if necessary. One advantage humans will have is the lack of diversity of such an invasive population – leaving the hornets less prepared for novel environments and challenges.

In June 2021 a dead, desiccated male was found near Marysville, Snohomish County, Washington and reported to WSDA. Its different, more reddish color form immediately suggested yet another parental population from the Japanese and Korean ones already known. USDA APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) performed a genetic analysis several days later and, together with WSDA, confirmed it was of a third, unrelated population. The discovery of a male in June is &quot;perplexing&quot; given that the earliest male emergence in 2020 was July, which was already earlier than normal for the home range. This and its desiccated state indicate it did not emerge in 2021 at all, but is instead a dead specimen that had already emerged in a previous year.

The WSDA announced in December 2022 that there were &quot;no confirmed sightings&quot; of the hornet in the state for that year, and in December 2023 stated there were no sightings in 2023, and in December of 2024, it was announced that the hornets had been eradicated from North America.

==Nesting==
&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; nests in low mountain foothills and lowland forests. As a particularly dominant species, no efforts are directed toward conserving &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; or its habitats, as they are common in areas of low human disturbance. Unlike other species of &quot;Vespa&quot;, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; almost exclusively inhabits subterranean nests in 1978 it was still doubted that aerial nests were possible, as Matsuura and Sakagami reported this to be unknown in Japan in 1973 and aerial nesting is still described as extremely rare in Japan, and yet all nests in the invasive range have been aerial.

In a study of 31 nests, 25 were found around rotten pine roots, and another study found only 9 of 56 nests above ground. Additionally, rodents, snakes, or other burrowing animals previously made some of the tunnels. The depth of these nests was between . The entrance at the ground surface varies in length from either horizontally, inclined, or vertically. The queens that found the nest prefer narrow cavities.

Nests of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; typically lack a developed envelope. During the initial stages of development, the envelope is in an inverted-bowl shape. As the nest develops, one to three rough sheets of combs are created. Often, single combs are created simultaneously and then fused into a single comb.

A system of one main pillar and secondary pillars connects the combs. Nests usually have four to seven combs. The top comb is abandoned after summer and left to rot. The largest comb is at the middle to bottom portion of the nest. The largest combs created by &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; measured with 1,192 cells (no obstacles, circular) and (elliptical; wrapped around a root system).

==Colony cycle==
The nesting cycle of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is fairly consistent with that of other eusocial insects. Six phases occur in each cycle.

===Pre-nesting period===
Inseminated and uninseminated queens enter hibernation following a cycle. They first appear in early to mid-April and begin feeding on the sap of &quot;Quercus&quot; (oak) trees. Although this timing is consistent among hornets, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; dominates the order, receiving preference for premium sap sources. Among the &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; queens is a dominance hierarchy. The top-ranked queen begins feeding, while the other queens form a circle around her. Once the top queen finishes, the second-highest-ranking queen feeds. This process repeats until the last queen feeds at a poor hour.

===Solitary, cooperative, and polyethic periods===
Inseminated queens start to search for nesting sites in late April. The uninseminated queens do not search for nests, since their ovaries never fully develop. They continue to feed, but then disappear in early July.

An inseminated queen begins to create relatively small cells in which she raises around 40 small workers. Workers do not begin to work outside of the hive until July. Queens participate in activities outside the hive until mid-July, when they stay inside the nest and allow workers to do extranidal activities. Early August marks a fully developed nest, containing three combs holding 500 cells and 100 workers. After mid-September, no more eggs are laid and the focus shifts to caring for larvae. The queens die in late October.

===Dissolution and hibernating period===
Males and new queens take on their responsibilities in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense and the weights of the queens increase about 20%. Once the males and queens leave the nest, they do not return. In &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;, males wait outside the nest entrance until the queens emerge, when males intercept them in midair, bring them to the ground, and copulate from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the now-mated queens leave to hibernate. Many queens (up to 65%) attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized, at least temporarily. After this episode, pre-hibernating queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats.

When sexed individuals emerge, workers shift their focus from protein and animal foods to carbohydrates. The last sexed individuals to emerge may die of starvation.

==Sting==
The stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about long.

===Venom===
Their stinger injects an especially potent venom that contains . Mastoparans are found in many bee and wasp venoms. They are cytolytic peptides that can damage tissue by stimulating phospholipase action, in addition to its own phospholipase. Masato Ono, an entomologist at Tamagawa University, described the sensation of being stung as feeling &quot;like a hot nail being driven into my leg&quot;. Besides using their stingers to inject venom, Asian giant hornets are apparently able to spray venom into a person&#x27;s eyes under certain circumstances, with one report in 2020 from Japan of long-term damage, though the exact extent of actual visual impairment still remains unassessed.

The venom contains a neurotoxin called , a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight around 20 kDa. While a single wasp cannot inject a lethal dose, multiple stings can be lethal even to people who are not allergic if the dose is sufficient, and allergy to the venom greatly increases the risk of death. Tests involving mice found that the venom falls short of being the most lethal of all wasp venoms, having an of 4.0mg/kg. (In comparison, the deadliest wasp venom (at least to laboratory mice) by weight belongs to &quot;V. luctuosa&quot; at 1.6mg/kg.) The potency of the &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; sting is due, rather, to the relatively large amount of venom injected.

====Immunogenicity====
Evidence is insufficient to believe that prophylactic immunotherapy for the venom of other Vespidae will prevent allergic reaction to &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; venom, because of wide differences in venom chemistry.

===Effects on humans===
In 1957, van der Vecht was under the impression humans in the native range lived in constant fear of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; and Iwata reported in 1976 that research and removal were hampered by its attacks.

==Parasites==
The strepsipteran &quot;Xenos moutoni&quot; is a common parasite among &quot;Vespa&quot; species. In a study of parasites among species of &quot;Vespa&quot;, 4.3% of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; females were parasitized. Males were not stylopized (parasitization by stylopid strepsipterans, such as &quot;X. moutoni&quot;) at all. The major consequence of being parasitized is the inability to reproduce, and stylopized queens follow the same fate as uninseminated queens. They do not search for an area to create a new colony and feed on sap until early July, when they disappear. In other species of &quot;Vespa&quot;, males also have a chance of being stylopized. The consequences between the two sexes are similar, as neither sex is able to reproduce.

==Communication and perception==
&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; uses both visual and chemical cues as a means of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when vision impairment was induced. This implies that while chemical signaling is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. Other behaviors include the formation of a &quot;royal court&quot; consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her pheromones.

These pheromones could directly communicate between the queen and her court or indirectly between her court and other workers due to the ingested pheromones. This is merely speculation, as no direct evidence has been collected to suggest the latter. &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; communicates acoustically, as well. When larvae are hungry, they scrape their mandibles against the walls of the cell. Furthermore, adult hornets click their mandibles as a warning to other creatures that encroach upon their territories.

==Scent marking==
&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is the only species of social wasp known to apply a scent to direct its colony to a food source. The hornet secretes the chemical from the sixth sternal gland, also known as van der Vecht&#x27;s gland. This behavior is observed during autumnal raids after the hornets begin hunting in groups instead of individually. The ability to apply scents may have arisen because the Asian giant hornet relies heavily on honey bee colonies as its main food source.

A single hornet is unable to take on an entire colony of honey bees because species such as &quot;Apis cerana&quot; have a well-organized defense mechanism. The honey bees swarm one wasp and vibrate their thoracic muscles to heat up the hornet and raise carbon dioxide to a lethal level. So, organized attacks are much more effective and easily devastate a colony of tens of thousands of honey bees.

==Interspecies dominance==
In an experiment observing four different species of &quot;Vespa&quot; (&quot;V. ducalis&quot;, &quot;V. crabro&quot;, &quot;V. analis&quot;, and &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;), &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; was the dominant species. Multiple parameters were set to determine this. The first set parameter observed interaction-mediated departures, which are defined as scenarios wherein one species leaves its position due to the arrival of a more dominant individual. The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;. Another measured parameter was attempted patch entry. Over the observed time, conspecifics (interactions with the same species) resulted in refused entry far more than heterospecifics (interactions with different species).

Lastly, when feeding at sap flows, fights between these hornets, &quot;Pseudotorynorrhina japonica&quot;, &quot;Neope goschkevitschii&quot;, and &quot;Lethe sicelis&quot; were observed, and once more &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; was the most dominant species. In 57 separate fights, one loss was observed to &quot;Neope goschkevitschii&quot;, giving &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; a win rate of 98.3%. Based on interaction-mediated departures, attempted patch entry, and interspecific fights, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is the most dominant &quot;Vespa&quot; species.

==Diet==
The Asian giant hornet is intensely predatory; it hunts medium- to large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet and wasp species, beetles, hornworms, and mantises. The latter are favored targets in late summer and fall. Large insects such as mantises are key protein sources to feed queen and drone larvae. Workers forage to feed their larvae, and since their prey can include crop pests, the hornets are sometimes regarded as beneficial.

This hornet often attacks colonies of other &quot;Vespa&quot; species (&quot;V. simillima&quot; being the usual prey species), &quot;Vespula&quot; species, and honey bee (such as &quot;Apis cerana&quot; and &quot;A. mellifera&quot;) hives to obtain the adults, pupae, and larvae as food for their own larvae. Sometimes, they cannibalize each other&#x27;s colonies. A single scout, sometimes two or three, cautiously approaches the hive, producing pheromones to lead its nest-mates to the hive. The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees, especially if it is the introduced western honey bee. A single hornet can kill as many as 40 bees per minute due to its large mandibles, which can quickly strike and decapitate prey.

The honey bees&#x27; stings are ineffective because the hornets are five times their size and heavily armored. Only a few hornets (under 50) can exterminate a colony of tens of thousands of bees in a few hours. The hornets can fly up to in a single day, at speeds up to . The smaller Asian hornet similarly preys on honey bees, and has been spreading throughout Europe.

Hornet larvae, but not adults, can digest solid protein. The adult hornets can only drink the juices of their victims, and they chew their prey into a paste to feed to their larvae. The workers dismember the bodies of their prey to return only the most nutrient-rich body parts, such as flight muscles, to the nest. Larvae of predatory social vespids generally, not just &quot;Vespa&quot;, secrete a clear liquid, sometimes referred to as &quot;Vespa&quot; amino acid mixture, the exact amino acid composition of which varies considerably from species to species, and which they produce to feed the adults on demand.

===Native honey bees===
Beekeepers in Japan attempted to introduce western honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) for the sake of their high productivity. Western honey bees have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies. Kakugo virus infection, though, may provide an extrinsic defence. Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a western honey bee colony, the Japanese honey bee (&quot;Apis cerana japonica&quot;) has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honey bee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honey bees detect these pheromones, 100 or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open.

This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles in much the same way as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of .

In addition, the exertions of the honey bees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. The bees can tolerate up to even at that concentration of CO2, but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some honey bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony.

Detailed research suggests this account of the behavior of the honey bees and a few species of hornets is incomplete and that the honey bees and the predators are developing strategies to avoid expensive and mutually unprofitable conflict. Instead, when honey bees detect scouting hornets, they transmit an &quot;I see you&quot; signal that commonly warns off the predator. Another defence used by &quot;Apis cerana&quot; is speeding up dramatically when returning to the colony, to avoid midair attacks.

===Diet in North America===
Based on an examination of larval waste products, the Washington State Department of Agriculture determined that the prey of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; included cluster fly, orange legged drone fly, bristle fly, bronze birch borer beetle, western honey bee, western yellowjacket, German yellowjacket, aerial yellowjacket, bald faced hornet, European paper wasp, golden paper wasp, paddle-tailed darner dragonfly, shadow darner dragonfly, large yellow underwing moth, blinded sphinx moth, and red admiral butterfly (&quot;Vanessa atalanta&quot;). They had also eaten cow&#x27;s meat, but the WSDA suggests that this may have been beef from a hamburger.

== Predators ==
The Asian giant hornet has very few natural predators. However, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; nests are attacked by conspecific colonies, and crested honey buzzards may prey on this hornet. Besides the honey buzzard and each other, there are also instances of other insects such as mantises killing Asian giant hornets.

== Pollination ==
&quot;V. mandarinia&quot; is not solely carnivorous, but also a pollinator. It is among the diurnal pollinators of the obligate plant parasite &quot;Mitrastemon yamamotoi&quot;. It is among the most common pollinators of &quot;Musella lasiocarpa&quot; in the Yunnan Province of China.

==Extermination methods==
As of 1973, six different methods were used to control hornets in Japan; these methods decrease damage done by &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;.

===Beating===
Hornets are crushed with wooden sticks with flat heads. Hornets do not counterattack when they are in the bee-hunting phase or the hive-attack phase (&quot;slaughter&quot;), but they aggressively guard a beehive once they kill the defenders and occupy it. The biggest expenditure in this method is time, as the process is inefficient.

===Nest removal===
Applying poisons or fires at night is an effective way of exterminating a colony. The most difficult part about this tactic is finding the subterranean nests. The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;, this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of . &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; travels up to away from the nest.

For the rare nest that is up in a tree, wrapping the tree in plastic and vacuuming the hornets out is used.

===Bait traps===
Bait traps can be placed in apiaries. The system consists of multiple compartments that direct the hornet into a one-sided hole which is difficult to return through once it is in the &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; compartment, an area located at the top of the box from which honey bees can escape through a mesh opening, but wasps cannot due to their large size. Baits used to attract the hornets include a diluted millet jelly solution or a crude sugar solution with a mixture of intoxicants, vinegar, or fruit essence.

The WSDA has been using plastic bottle traps, baited with fruit juice and added alcohol. The alcohol is used because it repels bees, but not &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;, thus reducing the bycatch.

===Mass poisoning===
Hornets at the apiary are captured and fed a sugar solution or bee that has been poisoned with malathion. The toxin is expected to spread through trophallaxis. This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively.

===Trapping at hive entrances===
The trap is attached to the front of beehives. The effectiveness of the trap is determined by its ability to capture hornets while allowing honey bees to escape easily. The hornet enters the trap and catches a bee. When it tries to fly back through the entrance of the hive, it hits the front of the trap. The hornet flies upwards to escape and enters the capture chamber, where the hornets are left to die. Some hornets find a way to escape the trap through the front, so these traps can be very inefficient.

===Protective screens===
As explained in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only honey bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine protective screens with traps.

===Glue traps===
Some Japanese beekeepers place glue traps of the sort commonly used against mice atop the bees&#x27; artificial nesting box with a disarmed giant hornet stuck to the glue. The struggling hornet attracts more hornets who try to help and then get trapped on the glue sheet.

==Human consumption==

In some Japanese mountain villages, the nests are excavated and the larvae are considered a delicacy when fried. In the central Chūbu region, these wasps are sometimes eaten as snacks or an ingredient in drinks. The grubs are often preserved in jars, pan-fried or steamed with rice to make a savory dish called &quot;hebo-gohan&quot; or &quot;hebo-han&quot; (へぼ飯). The adults are fried on skewers, stinger and all, until the body becomes crunchy.

==Potential economic impact==

If &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; were to settle all suitable habitats in North America, potential control costs in the United States would be over US$113.7 million/year (possibly significantly higher). Washington was the only state with confirmed sightings, and there were no confirmed sightings in Washington after 2021, and is now considered extirpated.

If &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; were to reach all suitable habitat in North America, bee products would bring in US$11.98 ± 0.64 million &quot;less&quot; per year, and bee-pollinated crops would produce US$101.8 million less per year. New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Virginia would be most severely affected. By region, New England would be worst hit, and to a lesser degree the entire northeast and the entirety of eastern North America. New England would potentially become by far the greatest concentration of &quot;V. mandarinia&quot; in the world, far surpassing the original introduction site (the Pacific Northwest), and even its home range of East Asia. Alfalfa/other hays, apples, grapes, tobacco, cotton, and blueberries would be the crops most severely affected.

<text>The Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a United States chemical weapons manufacturing center located in the Denver Metropolitan Area in Commerce City, Colorado. The site was completed December 1942, operated by the United States Army throughout the later 20th century and was controversial among local residents until its closure in 1992.

Much of the site is now protected as the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge.

==History==
After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, the U.S. Army began looking for land to create a chemical manufacturing center. Located just north of Denver, in Commerce City and close to the Stapleton Airport, the U.S. Army purchased . The location was ideal, not only because of the proximity to the airport, but because of the geographic features of the site, it was less likely to be attacked. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal manufactured chemical weapons including mustard gas, napalm, white phosphorus, lewisite, chlorine gas, and sarin. In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army began to lease out its facilities to private companies to manufacture pesticides. In the early 1980s the site was selected as a Superfund site and the cleanup process began. In the mid-1980s, wildlife, including endangered species, moved into the space and the land became a protected wildlife refuge.

===Policy===
The environmental movement began in the United States in the 1960-1970s. The U.S. Congress responded to the movement in 1980 with the creation of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), most commonly referred to as a Superfund. CERCLA was a tax imposed on chemical and petroleum industries. CERCLA also gave the Federal government the authority to respond to the release of life-threatening hazardous materials. 
After 42 years of chemical manufacturing, in 1984, the United States Army began to inspect the level of contamination at Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA). The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL), a list of the most contaminated areas in the United States. Rocky Mountain Arsenal, among other post-military sites, was a top priority, establishing RMA as a superfund site. This was further exacerbated when the U.S. Army discovered an endangered species, the bald eagle. After the bald eagles were captured, tested, and found to be healthy, the National Wildlife Federation worked with policymakers to transition RMA to a wildlife refuge. In 1992, Congress passed the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act (RMANWR Act). Included in the RMANWR Act, areas within RMA that were still contaminated were still owned by the U.S. Army, however, the vast majority of the land that was deemed clean would be managed by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).
Tensions arose between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the State of Colorado, United States Army, and the chemical industries as they partnered to clean up the site and create the RMANWR. This led the State of Colorado to take legal action over who has legal authority over RMA remediation efforts, payment of natural resource damages (NRDs), and reimbursement of costs expended for cleanup activities (response costs).

==Site selection==
The Arsenal&#x27;s location was selected due to its relative distance from the coasts (and presumably not likely to be attacked), a sufficient labor force to work at the site, weather that was conducive to outdoor work, and the appropriate soil needed for the project. It was also helpful that the location was close to Stapleton airfield, a major transportation hub.

In 1942, the US Army acquired of land on which to manufacture weapons in support of World War II military activities at a cost of $62,415,000. Additionally, some of this land was used for a prisoner of war camp (for German combatants) and later transferred to the city of Denver as Stapleton Airport expanded. A lateral was built off the High Line Canal to supply water to the Arsenal.

==Manufacturing operations==

Weapons manufactured at RMA included both conventional and chemical munitions, including white phosphorus (M34 grenade), napalm, mustard gas, lewisite, and chlorine gas.
RMA is also one of the few sites that had a stockpile of Sarin gas (aka nerve agent GB), an organophosphorus compound. The manufacturing of these weapons continued until 1969. Rocket fuel to support Air Force operations was also manufactured and stored at RMA. Subsequently, through the 1970s until 1985, RMA was used as a demilitarization site to destroy munitions and chemically related items. Coinciding with these activities, from 1946 to 1982, the Army leased RMA facilities to private industries for the production of pesticides. One of the major lessees, Shell Oil Company, along with Julius Hyman and Company and Colorado Fuel and Iron, had manufacturing and processing capabilities on RMA between 1952 and 1982. The military reserved the right to oust these companies and restart chemical weapon production in the event of a national emergency.

==Deep injection well==
RMA contained a deep injection well that was constructed in 1961. It was drilled to a depth of . The well was cased and sealed to a depth of , with the remaining left as an open hole for the injection of Basin F liquids. For testing purposes, the well was injected with approximately 568,000 US gallons (2150 m³) of city water prior to injecting any waste. The injected fluids had very little potential for reaching the surface or usable groundwater supply since the injection point had of rock above it and was sealed at the opening. The Army discontinued use of the well in February 1966 because the fluid injection triggered a series of earthquakes in the area. The well remained unused until 1985 when the Army permanently sealed the disposal well.

==Environmental issues==

In 1984, the Army began a systematic investigation of site contamination in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund. In 1987, the RMA was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites. As provided by CERCLA, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was conducted to determine the extent of contamination. Since 1985, the mission at RMA has been the remediation of the site.

===Contaminants===
The primary contaminants include organochloride pesticides, organophosphate pesticides, carbamate insecticides, organic solvents and feedstock chemicals used as raw products or intermediates in the manufacturing process (e.g., chlorinated benzenes), heavy metals, chemical warfare material and their related breakdown products and biological warfare agent such as TX. Additionally, ordnance (including incendiary munitions) was manufactured and tested, and asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used at RMA. Today, it is considered a hazardous waste site according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

===Groundwater contamination===
The contamination of the underlying alluvial aquifer occurred due to the discharge of waste into unlined basins. The following data were derived from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. From 1943 to 1956, the US Army and Shell discharged wastes into the unlined basins resulting in the contamination of the South Platte River outside the Arsenal. Farmers in the vicinity complained about the damage to crops due to the water pumped from the shallow alluvial aquifer. In response, the Army constructed an asphalt-lined impoundment for the disposal of wastes in 1956. Further, in 1961, the Army constructed a 12,000-foot deep injection well for the disposal of wastes. This resulted in subsequent earthquakes in Denver area. In 1975, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ordered the Army and Shell to stop the non-permitted discharge of contaminants, to control the contaminated groundwater leaving the site, and to implement a monitoring plan. The Army and Shell took remedial actions to prevent the contamination that includes the installation of the groundwater barrier system which treated approximately 1 billion gallons of water every year. The deep injection well was closed in 1985 and Basin F was closed in 1988 
According to National Resource Damage Assessment, although the contamination has been reduced by the treatment efforts, the water in and around the arsenal may never be fully clean. A volume of approximately 52,500 acre-feet (65 million cubic metres) of the alluvial aquifer is not usable for human consumption.

===Wildlife Injuries===
The NRDA found several injuries to wildlife. It was estimated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that at least 20,000 ducks died in a 10-year span during the 1970s. Mallard carcasses found to have higher levels of Dieldrin. Many mammals and birds were found dead and may have suffered lower reproduction rates or birth defects.

==Safety concerns for neighboring residents==
Because of the Superfund site status and the dramatic cleanups, many residents in neighborhoods surrounding the RMA voiced concern about ongoing health risks of living within the close vicinity of the site. In September 2017, the state of Colorado filed a lawsuit to sue the United States government for the right to control the contaminated areas of the RMA. Though the cleanup of the site was considered complete in 2010, soil and groundwater monitoring practices occur every five years to ensure the effects of the clean-up remain. Restrictions on well water use, residential development, consumption of fish and game from the arsenal, and agricultural use of the arsenal will exist in perpetuity until further scientific research is completed at the site.

===Water===
Many of the surrounding neighborhoods have been provided with potable tap water from other areas of Adams county because of the potential effects of contaminated groundwater from wells. Trace amounts of the chemical 1,4-dioxane has been found in some samples of drinking water. There is no appropriate standard by the EPA, but the state of Colorado has a standard treatment protocol for this chemical.

===Soil===
As part of the clean up of the RMA, much of the soil, up to 10 feet below the surface was removed from the site. This soil is contained in hazardous waste landfills. Contaminated areas of soil remain in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, but are contained in basins and containment structures.

===Air quality===
During the cleanup of the RMA, concern for air pollution from the hazardous materials was raised. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment established monitoring systems throughout various locations of the RMA. Throughout the decades of cleanup, the air monitors revealed there was no safety hazard to public health as no arsenal chemicals had been released into the air.

===Epidemiological studies===
Longstanding agricultural and health concerns related to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal have resulted in a complex history of political and legal battles. Heavy volatile contaminants related to Basin F raised concern among the public for the site and the process of the clean-up itself of the Arsenal and a medical monitoring program (MMP) was put in place as part of the Record of Decision (ROD) between the U.S. Army, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Colorado Department of Health and Environment in 1996. One of the goals of the MMP was to enhance community assurance that the clean-up was effective, and it included air quality monitoring, cancer surveillance, and birth defects surveillance. Air quality monitoring of the Arsenal began concurrently with the decontamination process in 1997 and surveillance continued until July 2009.

The Surveillance for Birth Defects utilized passive observational data from an existing birth defects registry March 1989 – March 2009. The following data were derived from the &quot;Rocky Mountain Arsenal Medical Monitoring Program Surveillance for Birth Defects Compendium&quot; prepared by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and published in February 2010. In this study, baseline birth defects were estimated from the time period 1989–1997, which was the point at which the clean-up began, and inclusion criteria included mother&#x27;s address at the time of birth being within the geographical study area. Other demographics of the mother were gathered as well. Birth defects included in the analysis were: &quot;total congenital anomalies, major congenital anomalies, heart defects, muscle and skeletal defects, and kidney and bladder defects,&quot; and these categories were inconsistent in reporting accuracy. Statistically significant findings (p&lt;0.01) of this study included demographic differences in the mothers as follows: median age 24, compared to 27 years of age in Colorado as a whole, higher percent of mothers who were white/Hispanic and black, mean education level of 11.8 years compared to 13.1 years in Colorado as a whole, fewer mothers who were married, and fewer prenatal visits on average. These potential confounders are not clearly addressed in this report and may complicate the analysis as well as raise concern for disparities in exposure risk that is dependent upon demographic factors. Baseline rates of congenital anomalies in the study area compared to Colorado as a whole did not show significant differences between populations. No significant increase was observed in congenital anomalies during the clean-up period compared to pre-clean up, although there are no baseline data prior to initial contamination events because data was not yet being collected and the population was very different at that time.

In summary, there is no current evidence of health effects. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found no increased risk of birth defects in infants. A separate study of cancer incidence by the Colorado Department of Health did not find convincing evidence of increased cancer risk in people living in residential areas surrounding the arsenal, although the study was made more difficult by the large demographic changes in the area and was also confounded by smoking and obesity rates. Additionally, studies performed at Colorado State University found no increased risk of Arsenic, Mercury, or neurotoxicity in communities within 15 miles of the RMA.

==Economic impact of contamination and clean up==
Many projects have attempted to clean contaminated groundwater at the Arsenal. For example, DIMP (diisopropyl methyl phosphonate) was one of the main contaminants in the area. One monitoring project has demonstrated incremental improvements over time, and specifically measured 640 parts per billion (ppb) in 1987 and 55 ppb in 1989, while a different off-post monitoring well measured 138 ppb in 1985, 105 ppb in 1987, 14 ppb in 1988, and 6.7 ppb in 1989. While it is difficult to capture the societal cost to clean up the site, the list of actions dealing with groundwater contamination listed by Mears and Heise include:

* North boundary groundwater treatment system (1979–82) – $4.3 million
* Irondale groundwater treatment system by Shell (1981) – $1.1 million
* Basin F liquid evaporation and contaminated sewer removal (1982) – $1.5 million
* Northwest boundary groundwater treatment system (1984) – $5.5 million
* Deep well closure (1986) – $2.5 million
* Removal of 76,000 drums of waste salts (1986) – $10.5 million
* Treatment in the public water supply and The Klein Water Treatment Facility supplies safe drinking water to 30,000 south Adams County residents (1989) – $23.1 million
* Removal and containment of 10.5M gallons of Basin F liquids and 564,000 cubic yards of sludges (1989) – $42 million
* Improvements and modifications to North boundary system (1990–1) – $2.75 million
* Closure of 353 abandoned wells on-post (1990) – $3.7 million
* Basin F groundwater intercept system (1990) – $0.7 million
* Basin A neck groundwater treatment system (1990) – $3.1 million
* Northwest Boundary System Improvement (1991) – $1.4 million
* Rail classification yard and motor pool ground water (1991) – $3.0 million
* South tank farm plume (1991) – $0.5 million
* Army trenches (1991) – $1.4 million
* Shell trenches (1991) – $3.2 million
* Reapplication of windblown dust control (1991) – $0.25 million
* Groundwater treatment system to the north (1992–3) – $8.7 million
* Building 1727 sump cleanup (1993) – $0.18 million

Direct economic totals add up to approximately $111 million and this estimation does not include operation and maintenance costs.
In addition, there were actions completed by Future Farmers of America (FFA) between 1991 and 1993 that cost approximately $151.2 million. A more recent article in 2004 by Pimentel, estimated the cost of removal pesticides from the groundwater and soil at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal by approximately $2 billion. Also, they noted that if all groundwater were to be cleared for human consumption, the cost would be $500 million annually.

Estimating exact direct and indirect impact of the contamination is very challenging as the cleaning and monitoring costs are complex. Further, there have been damages to the rural areas due to contamination resulting in livestock losses, and crop losses. In addition, contamination affects public health and nature (honeybee poisonings, pesticide resistance in pests, destruction of natural predators, wild birds, microbes) negatively. There are many studies that try to estimate the total costs due to contamination of pesticides in U.S. as well as in other countries; however, indirect costs are difficult to estimate, but likely several times than total direct environmental and social costs. In the case of Rocky Mountain Arsenal, total indirect cost was not estimated at all.

==Rocky Mountain Arsenal NWR Act==
In 1986, it was discovered that the absence of human activity had made the area an involuntary park when a winter communal roost of bald eagles, then an endangered species, was discovered on site. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventoried more than 330 species of wildlife that inhabit the Arsenal including deer, coyotes, white pelicans, and owls.

The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act was passed in October 1992 and signed by President George H. W. Bush. It stipulates that the majority of the site will become a National Wildlife Refuge under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service when the environmental restoration is completed. The act also provides that to the extent possible, parts of the arsenal are to be managed as a refuge in the interim. Finally, the act provides for the transfer of some arsenal land for road expansion around the perimeter of the arsenal and to be sold for development and annexation by Commerce City.

Already since 1995, the buildings became the seat of the National Eagle Repository, an office of the Fish and Wildlife Service that receives the bodies of all dead golden and bald eagles in the nation and provides feathers and other parts to Native Americans for cultural uses.

In September 2010, the cleanup was considered complete, and the remaining portions of land were transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, bringing the total to . Two sites were retained by the Army: the South Plants location due to historical use, and the North Plant location, which is now a landfill containing the remains of various buildings used in the plants.

On May 21, 2011, the official visitor center for the refuge was opened with an exhibit about the site&#x27;s history, ranging from the homesteading era to its current status.

===Public use===
Congruent with the outline of the June 1996 USFWS Comprehensive Management Plan, RMA will be available for public use through both community outreach and educational programs (as provided by the Visitor Access Plan and the USFWS). This public availability will be implemented while simultaneously supporting the remediation effort and the USFWS activities.

===Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park===
In April 2007 Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park, a soccer-specific stadium, was opened on part of the former Rocky Mountain Arsenal land that was transferred to Commerce City. The new venue hosts the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.

===Bison===
A small herd of wild bison was introduced to the refuge in March 2007 as part of the USFWS Bison Project. The animals were transferred from the National Bison Range in Montana.

<text>A land grant is a gift of real estate—land or its use privileges—made by a government or other authority as an incentive, means of enabling works, or as a reward for services to an individual, especially in return for military service. Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as homesteads to individuals desiring to make a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the Main Line of Public Works legislation of 1863) promoting commerce or transportation infrastructure development by private companies, such as the Cumberland Road turnpike, the Lehigh Canal, the Schuylkill Canal and the many railroads that tied the young United States together.

==Ancient Rome==
Roman soldiers were given pensions (&quot;praemia&quot;) at the end of their service including cash or land. Augustus fixed the amount in 5 AD at 3,000 denarii, and by the time of Caracalla it had risen to 5,000 denarii. One denarius was roughly equivalent to a day&#x27;s wages for an unskilled laborer.

==Australia==
In 1788 the British claimed all of eastern Australia as its own, and formed the colony of New South Wales in Australia. The land was claimed as crown land. Over time, it granted land to officers and released convicts. Males were allowed , plus if they were married, and additional per child. Instructions were issued on 20 August 1789 that non-commissioned marine officers were to be entitled to additional and privates to additional.

Governor Macquarie canceled land grants issued during the Rum Rebellion of 1808–09, although some were later restored.

Land grants started to be phased out when private tendering was introduced, and stricter limits were placed on grants without purchase. The instructions to Governor Brisbane were issued on 17 July 1825. From 9 January 1831, all land was to be sold at public auction.

There were also significant land grants in the Swan River Colony (Western Australia), and in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) from 1803.

=== Land grant railways ===
* In 1886, the Midland Railway of Western Australia was granted land concessions to build and operate a railway from Midland, near Perth, to Walkaway, near Geraldton. This was built, but taken over by the government railway in the 1950s. It was and is gauge. 
* In 1889, a land grant railway from Roebuck Bay in Western Australia to Angle Pole in South Australia was proposed. This would have been long. Angle Pole was a locality where the telegraph line had a bend in it. It was stillborn. The gauge would have been .
* In 1897, a transcontinental north–south land grant railway was proposed to complete the missing link between Oodnadatta and Darwin, the latter then called Palmerston or Port Darwin. The plan was abandoned, though the government railway was extended in the 1920s from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, with similar extensions at the Darwin end. It was originally gauge, but was replaced by a new gauge line on a different route.
* In 1909, a land grant railway was proposed in Queensland from Charleville to Point Parker on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but the plan was abandoned.

==Canada==
The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was incorporated in 1670 with the grant of Rupert&#x27;s Land by King Charles II of England; this vast territory was greater than one third the area of Canada today. Following the Rupert&#x27;s Land Act in the British Parliament, Rupert&#x27;s Land was sold in 1869 to the newly formed Canadian Government for the nominal sum of £300,000.

Land grants were an incentive for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

==Ireland==
The Plantations of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries involved the confiscation of some or all the land of Irish lords and its grant to settlers (&quot;planters&quot;) from England or Scotland. The English Parliament&#x27;s Adventurers&#x27; Act 1640 and Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 specifically entitled &quot;Adventurers&quot; who funded the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland to lands seized from the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the ensuing Confederacy.

== New Zealand ==
In New Zealand two private railway companies were offered land grants to build a railway, though both were eventually taken over by the government and incorporated into the government-owned New Zealand Railways Department. 
:The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company built and operated the 134 km Wellington-Manawatu Line north of Wellington to the Manawatu from 1881. The company was New Zealand owned. It was taken over by the government in 1908, and the line became part of the North Island Main Trunk. 
:The New Zealand Midland Railway Company started the Midland Line between Canterbury and the West Coast in 1886 but the British-owned company was taken over by the government in 1895, having constructed only 131 km of the 376 km route.

==United States==
===Colonial era===

==== English land grants ====

During England&#x27;s colonization of the Americas, the English Crown gave land grants to encourage the foundation of overseas possessions in North America. King James I of England granted a royal charter to the Virginia Company of London, an English joint-stock company founded to colonize Virginia. Similar schemes were later used when royal charters were granted by the Crown to English proprietary colonies in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Some settlers were given land grants known as headrights, encouraging them to migrate to North America. Similar systems were used during the Dutch colonization of the Americas.

As English colonial law developed, headrights became patents and a patentee had to improve the land. Under this doctrine of planting and seeding, the patentee was required to cultivate of land and build a small house on the property, otherwise the patent would revert to the government.

==== Spanish and Mexican land grants ====

Between 1783 and 1821, Spain offered land grants to anyone who settled in their colonies of Florida and Louisiana. When the United States acquired that land by treaties, it agreed to honor all valid land grants. As a result, years of litigation ensued over the validity of many of the Spanish land grants.

Spain and Mexico used the same system of offering land grants along the Rio Grande River near the Texas/Mexico border. These grants were given to help colonization of the area, initially by the Spanish crown, and later by Mexican authorities nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. During the Mexican period of California (and other portions of Mexican territories inherited from New Spain), the Mexican government granted individuals hundreds of ranchos or large tracts of land. The ranchos established land-use patterns that remain recognizable in the California of today. Controversy over community land grant claims in New Mexico persist to this day.

===Public lands and bounty-land warrants===
Future President Thomas Jefferson crafted the Ordinance of 1784, which carved out ten prospective states west of the Appalachian Mountains and established the basis for the Public Land Survey System. The Land Ordinance of 1785 provided a method for settling that land and establishing government institutions, which became federal land policy until 1862. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, pursuant to which homesteading settlers could buy land, and certain land was set aside for public schools and other purposes. The federal government acquired additional lands by treaties with various Native American tribes, such as the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, by which many eastern tribes agreed to settle across the Mississippi River. Revenues from public land purchases were a major source of funding for the federal government through the 19th century, along with tariff revenues, since the federal income tax was not established until the 20th century.

Starting with the American Revolutionary War, veterans often received land grants instead of backpay or other remuneration. Bounty-land warrants, often for 160 acres, were issued to veterans from 1775 to 1855, thus including veterans of the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Mexican–American War, as well as various Indian wars. The land grants helped settle the Northwest Territory (and later smaller areas, such as the Indiana Territory, the Illinois Territory and the Wisconsin Territory) and as well as the Platte Purchase in Missouri. Eligibility for the warrants expanded over the years through new Congressional acts of 1842, 1850, 1852 and 1855 to the point where they could be sold or given to descendants. The warrant program was discontinued before the American Civil War.

During the 19th century, various states (or even smaller units), as well as the federal government, made extensive land grants to encourage internal improvements, usually to improve transportation, such as construction of bridges and canals. The Land Grant Act of 1850 provided for 3.75 million acres of land to the states to support railroad projects; by 1857 21 million acres of public lands were used for railroads in the Mississippi River valley, and the stage was set for more substantial Congressional subsidies to future railroads. Universities were also beneficiaries of land grants. All five of the transcontinental railroads in the United States were built using land grants.

The Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890 provided for the establishment of land-grant colleges.

==== Economic impact ====
There is general agreement that the United States&#x27; federal policy of offering land grants had a positive impact on economic development in the 19th century.

<doc id="1002569" wikidata="Q3533621" url="?curid=1002569" title="Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act">
<text>Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 is an act of the Parliament of India that grants special powers to the Indian Armed Forces to maintain public order in &quot;disturbed areas&quot;. According to the Disturbed Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1976 once declared &#x27;disturbed&#x27;, the area has to maintain status quo for a minimum of 3 months.
One such act passed on 11 September 1958 was applicable to the Naga Hills, then part of Assam. In the following decades it spread, one by one, to the other Seven Sister States in India&#x27;s northeast (at present, it is in force in the States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur {excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area}, Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of Arunachal Pradesh, and areas falling within the jurisdiction of the eight police stations of districts in Arunachal Pradesh bordering the State of Assam). Another one passed in 1983 and applicable to Punjab and Chandigarh was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. An act passed in 1990 was applied to Jammu and Kashmir and has been in force since.

The acts have received criticism from several sections for alleged concerns about human rights violations in the regions of its enforcement alleged to have happened. National Politicians like P. Chidambaram and Saifuddin Soz of Congress have advocated revocation of AFSPA, while some like Amarinder Singh are against its revocation.

2022: Areas in the Northeast have seen scale down of forces. Since 1954, for the first time, no army unit of the size of brigade is being employed for the purpose of counter insurgency. Now, only one brigade looks after the same role. Though, some of the residual army units are moved to the border areas.

==History==
The Armed Forces Special Powers Ordinance of 1942 was promulgated by the British colonial government on 15 August 1942 to suppress the Quit India Movement. Modeled on these lines, four ordinances—the Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the Assam Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the East Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the United provinces Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance were invoked by the Indian government to deal with the internal security situation in the country in 1947 which emerged due to the Partition of India. Article 355 of the Constitution of India confers power to the Central Government to protect every state from internal disturbance.

=== Armed Forces Special Powers (Assam and Manipur) Act, 1958 ===
In 1951, the Naga National Council Nation&#x27;. There was a boycott of the first general election of 1952 which later extended to a boycott of government schools and officials. In order to deal with the situation, the Assam government imposed the Assam Maintenance of Public Order (Autonomous District) Act in the Naga Hills in 1953 and intensified police action against the rebels. When the situation worsened, Assam deployed the Assam Rifles in the Naga Hills and enacted the Assam Disturbed Areas Act of 1955, providing a legal framework for the paramilitary forces and the armed state police to combat insurgency in the region. But the Assam Rifles and the state armed police could not contain the Naga rebellion and the rebel Naga Nationalist Council (NNC) formed a parallel government &quot;The Federal Government of Nagaland&quot; on 23 March 1956. The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Ordinance 1958 was promulgated by the President Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 22 May 1958. It was replaced by the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 on 11 September 1958.

The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 empowered only the Governors of the States and the Administrators of the Union Territories to declare areas in the concerned State or the Union Territory as &#x27;disturbed&#x27;. The reason for conferring such a power as per &quot;Objects and Reasons&#x27;&quot; appended to the Bill was that &quot;Keeping in view the duty of the Union under of the Constitution, &quot;interalia&quot;, to protect every State against internal disturbance, it is considered desirable that the Central government should also have power to declare areas as &#x27;disturbed&#x27;, to enable its armed forces to exercise the special powers&quot;. The territorial scope of the act also expanded to the seven states of the North-East - Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. In addition, the words &quot;The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958&quot; were substituted by &quot;Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958&quot;, getting the acronym of AFSPA, 1958.

Recently the Tripura state government has decided to withdraw the controversial act, citing significant reduction in the extent of terrorist activities in the state. In June 2015, after review, the AFSPA in Nagaland state was extended by one more year.

In November 2016, Government of India has extended AFSPA in three districts of Arunachal Pradesh- Tirap, Changlang and Longding. The period has further been extended by another 6 months in above three districts of Arunachal Pradesh in April, 2018. These have been declared as &quot;disturbed area&quot; under Section 3 of the AFSPA. In these districts, Naga underground factions including National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) and NSCN (Khaplang) are involved in extortion, recruitment of locals, and rivalry.

===The Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983===
The central government enacted the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act on 6 October 1983, repealing the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Ordinance, 1983 to enable the central armed forces to operate in the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh. The act was enforced in the whole of Punjab and Chandigarh on 15 October 1983. The terms of the act broadly remained the same as that of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Assam and Manipur) of 1972 except for two sections, which provided additional powers to the armed forces.
# Sub-section (e) was added to Section 4 stipulating that any vehicle can be stopped, searched and seized forcibly if it is suspected of carrying proclaimed offenders or ammunition.
# Section 5 was added to the act specifying that a soldier has the power to break open any locks &quot;if the key there of is withheld&quot;.
The act was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. However the Disturbed areas act was in force until 2012 in Chandigarh until the High Court struck it down.

===The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990===

The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990 was enacted in September, 1990.

If the governor of Jammu and Kashmir or the Central Government, is of opinion that the whole or any part of the union territory is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition then this act can be imposed.

==The act==
The Articles in the Constitution of India empower state governments to declare a state of emergency due to one or more of the following reasons:
* Failure of the administration and the local police to tackle local issues
* Return of (central) security forces leads to return of miscreants/erosion of the &quot;peace dividend&quot; 
* The scale of unrest or instability in the state is too large for local forces to handle
In such cases, it is the prerogative of the state government to call for central help. In most cases, for example during elections, when the local police may be stretched too thin to simultaneously handle day-to-day tasks, the central government obliges by sending in the BSF and the CRPF. Such cases do not come under the purview of AFSPA. AFSPA is confined to be enacted only when a state, or part of it, is declared a &#x27;disturbed area&#x27;. Continued unrest, like in the cases of militancy and insurgency, and especially when borders are threatened, are situations where AFSPA is resorted to.

By Act 7 of 1972, the power to declare areas as being disturbed was extended to the central government.

In a civilian setting, soldiers have no legal tender, and are still bound to the same command chain as they would be in a war theater. Neither the soldiers nor their superiors have any training in civilian law or policing procedures. This is where and why the AFSPA comes to bear - to legitimize the presence and acts of armed forces in emergency situations which have been deemed warlike.

According to the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), in an area that is proclaimed as &quot;disturbed&quot;, an officer of the armed forces has powers to:
*After giving such due warning, Fire upon or use other kinds of force even if it causes death, against the person who is acting against law or order in the disturbed area for the maintenance of public order,
*Destroy any arms dump, hide-outs, prepared or fortified position or shelter or training camp from which armed attacks are made by the armed volunteers or armed gangs or absconders wanted for any offence.
*To arrest without a warrant anyone who has committed cognizable offences or is reasonably suspected of having done so and may use force if needed for the arrest.
*To enter and search any premise in order to make such arrests, or to recover any person wrongfully restrained or any arms, ammunition or explosive substances and seize it.
*Stop and search any vehicle or vessel reasonably suspected to be carrying such person or weapons.
*Any person arrested and taken into custody under this act shall be made present over to the officer in charge of the nearest police station with least possible delay, together with a report of the circumstances occasioning the arrest.
*Army officers have legal immunity for their actions. There can be no prosecution, suit or any other legal proceeding against anyone acting under that law. Nor is the government&#x27;s judgment on why an area is found to be disturbed subject to judicial review.
*Protection of persons acting in good faith under this act from prosecution, suit or other legal proceedings, except with the sanction of the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by this act.

On 8 July 2016, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court of India ended the immunity of the armed forces from prosecution under AFSPA, saying, in an 85-page judgement, &quot;It does not matter whether the victim was a common person or a militant or a terrorist, nor does it matter whether the aggressor was a common person or the state. The law is the same for both and is equally applicable to both ... This is the requirement of a democracy and the requirement of preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of individual liberties.&quot;

==Non-state views and commentary==

=== United Nations views ===
When India presented its second periodic report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1991, members of the UNHRC asked numerous questions about the validity of the AFSPA. They questioned the constitutionality of the AFSPA under Indian law and asked how it could be justified in light of Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR. On 23 March 2009, UN Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay asked India to repeal the AFSPA. She termed the law as &quot;dated and colonial-era law that breach contemporary international human rights standards.&quot;

On 31 March 2012, the UN asked India to revoke AFSPA saying it had no place in Indian democracy. Christof Heyns, UN&#x27;s Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions said &quot;During my visit to Kashmir, AFSPA was described to me as &#x27;hated&#x27; and &#x27;draconian&#x27;. It clearly violates International Law. A number of UN treaty bodies have pronounced it to be in violation of International Law as well.&quot;

===Non-governmental organizations&#x27; analysis===
The act has been criticized by Human Rights Watch as a &quot;tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination&quot;.

The South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre argues that the governments&#x27; call for increased force is part of the problem.
A report by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis points to multiple occurrences of violence by security forces against civilians in Manipur since the passage of the act. The report states that residents believe that the provision for immunity of security forces urge them to act more brutally. The article, however, goes on to say that repeal or withering away of the act will encourage insurgency. Irom Chanu Sharmila also known as the &quot;Iron Lady of Manipur&quot; or &quot;Mengoubi&quot; (&quot;the fair one&quot;) is a civil rights activist, political activist, and poet from the Indian state of Manipur. On 2 November 2000, she began a hunger strike which ended on 9 August 2016 after 16 years. On 2 November 2000, in Malom, a town in the Imphal Valley of Manipur, ten civilians were shot and killed while waiting at a bus stop. The incident, known as the &quot;Malom Massacre&quot;, was allegedly committed by the Assam Rifles, one of the Indian Paramilitary forces operating in the state.

In addition to this, there have been claims of disappearances by the police or the army in Kashmir by several human rights organizations.

Many human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) have condemned human rights abuses in Kashmir by police such as &quot;extra-judicial executions&quot;, &quot;disappearances&quot;, and torture; the &quot;Armed Forces Special Powers Act&quot;, which &quot;provides impunity for human rights abuses and fuels cycles of violence. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) grants the military wide powers of arrest, the right to shoot to kill, and to occupy or destroy property in counterinsurgency operations. Indian officials claim that troops need such powers because the army is only deployed when national security is at serious risk from armed combatants. Such circumstances, they say, call for extraordinary measures.&quot; Human rights organizations have also asked Indian government to repeal the Public Safety Act, since &quot;a detainee may be held in administrative detention for a maximum of two years without a court order.&quot;.

Activists who are working in J&amp;K for peace and human rights include names of Ashima Kaul, Ram Jethmalani, Faisal Khan, Ravi Nitesh (founder of Mission Bhartiyam), Swami Agnivesh, Dr. Sandeep Pandey and many others. They all accept that people to people communication and development of new avenues are the only way for peace, however laws like AFSPA are continuously violating human rights issues there.&quot; What [the Indian State] has failed to see is that such small, ethnic groups are resisting the Indian state for 55 years&quot; says legal activist and scholar, Babloo Loitongbom

===United States leaked diplomatic cables===
The United States diplomatic cables leak has disclosed that Indian government employees agree to acts of human rights violations on part of the Indian armed forces and various paramilitary forces deployed in the north east parts of India especially Manipur. The violations have been carried out under the cover of this very act. Governor S .S. Sidhu admitted to the American Consul General in Kolkata, Henry Jardine, that the Assam Rifles in particular are perpetrators of violations in Manipur which the very same cables described as a state that appeared more of a colony and less of an Indian state.

===Santosh Hegde commission on Manipur encounter deaths===

A high-power commission headed by the retired Supreme Court judge, N. Santosh Hegde was constituted in January 2013 to probe six encounter deaths in Manipur. The committee, comprising former Supreme Court judge Santosh Hegde, ex-CEC J M Lyngdoh and a senior police officer, has said in its report that the probe showed that none of the victims had any criminal records. The judicial commission set up by the Supreme Court is trying to make the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) more humane, and the security forces more accountable. The committee has suggested fixing a time frame of three months for the central government to decide whether to prosecute security personnel engaged in extrajudicial killings or unruly behaviour in insurgency-hit regions. The commission noted that AFSPA was an impediment to achieving peace in regions such as Jammu and Kashmir and the North East. The commission also said the law needs to be reviewed every six months to see whether its implementation is actually necessary in states where it is being enforced. About Section 6 of the act, which guarantees protection against prosecution to the armed forces, the report said: &quot;It is not that no action can be taken at all. Action can be taken but with prior sanction of the Central Government.&quot;

===Justice Jeevan Reddy Commission===
The commission recommended repealing AFSPA as &quot;the Act is a symbol of hate, oppression, and instrument of high-handedness&quot;. It had submitted its report on 06.06.2005. After 10 years, the government of India rejected the recommendation made by Justice Jeevan Reddy Commission to repeal the AFSPA.

===Second Administrative Reforms Commission===
The second Administratively Reforms Commission (ARC) in its fifth report on &quot;Public Order&quot;, recommended to repeal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958. It commented that its scrapping would remove sentiments of discrimination and alienation among the people of the North East India. The commission recommended to amend the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 inserting a new chapter to deploy the armed forces of the Union in the North eastern States. It supported a new doctrine of policing and criminal justice inherent in an inclusive approach to governance.

===Supreme Court of India===
Supreme Court said that any encounter carried out by armed forces in the garb of AFSPA should be subjected to thorough inquiry. In the words of supreme court &quot;It does not matter whether the victim was a common person or a militant or a terrorist, nor does it matter whether the aggressor was a common person or the state. The law is the same for both and is equally applicable to both. This is the requirement of a democracy and the requirement of preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of individual liberties.&quot;

<text>The Overloon War Museum (&quot;Dutch: Oorlogsmuseum Overloon&quot;) is located in Overloon, Netherlands.

The museum was opened on May 25, 1946 as the &quot;National War and Resistance Museum&quot;, making it one of the oldest museums in Europe dedicated to the Second World War. The museum is located on the site of the Battle of Overloon, a World War II tank and infantry battle between Allied and German forces that occurred in September and October 1944, in the aftermath of Operation Market Garden.

The museum is set in 14 hectares of woodland and is the largest of its kind in the Netherlands. The museum receives approximately 120,000 visitors annually.

==History==
After the Battle of Overloon, an enormous amount of war materiel, including tanks and other vehicles, was left behind on the battlefield. Overlooner Harry van Daal was so shocked by the events that he proposed keeping the battlefield intact and turning it into a museum. On May 25, 1946, the National War and Resistance Museum was opened by British General Whistler (1898-1963), commander of the 11th British Armored Division and the 3rd British Infantry Division that had conquered Overloon. In 2006, the collection of the Marshall Museum in Zwijndrecht was added with more than 200 military vehicles, ships and aircraft, for which a separate museum, named Liberty Park, was set up. The museum thus focused on both the Second World War and the acquisition and protection of freedom.
A feature of the museum is the large number of military vehicles and equipment on display, both German and Allied. For years these have been kept in the open air, but have recently been moved indoors to help preserve them. Many of the exhibited vehicles took part in the Battle of Overloon. In 2016, the collection was expanded with the collection of the Achterhoeks Museum 1940-1945, which closed its doors in 2015. The new exhibition of the Overloon War Museum includes the recognizable shop and café of the Achterhoeks Museum 1940-1945.

During the 2021 Christmas period, while the museum was closed due to restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, the museum released a series of videos about subjects in its collection. One of these videos was about Vincent Speranza, an American veteran of the Second World War.

==Collection==
The museum has a park of approximately 1000 by 500 m, making it one of the largest museums in the Netherlands in terms of land area. The special objects in the collection include:

* a Panther tank; this was disabled at the Battle of Overloon and the crew died while leaving it; the tank then stood under the sky for more than 50 years, but was restored and is now displayed indoors
* a Soviet Union T-34 tank, in running condition; this is regularly used during demonstrations
* a B-25 Mitchell bomber, which was still part of the 320 Dutch Squadron RAF. This aircraft took part in the attacks on the Maas bridges of Venlo and Roermond at the end of 1944
* a Renault FT-17 tank, the only tank the Netherlands possessed in 1940, as a test model
* a Sherman tank, the most deployed American tank of the Second World War, on a trailer
* a Spitfire, the most famous British fighter aircraft of the war
* a German Biber mini-submarine
* an Airspeed Horsa MK1 Assault Glider, a large glider of which 916 were deployed during Market Garden
* a C-47 Skytrain (Dakota), the most used transport aircraft during World War II
* a British Churchill tank found just outside Overloon. 4 crew members died in this vehicle
* a crashed Lancaster, the parts of which visitors can still view
* an American Sherman Crab
* a British Cromwell tank
* German radar installations, which played a major role in the Dutch air war that raged over the Netherlands for five years and cost 20,000 lives
* a forest course, where demonstration rides are made annually and re-enactments take place during the Militracks (in May) and Santa Fe events, among others
The museum also shows weapons, both cannons and small arms, uniforms of both the Allies and the Wehrmacht and military utensils, sometimes in recreated scenes. The museum also has a documentation department, open to the public. There is also a separate exhibition dedicated to the persecution of Jews in the Netherlands. The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions.

In addition, in the forest park and in the halls there are a number of statues of Dutch and Allied main figures from the war, including Colonel Borghouts , Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Bernhard. and inside several german tanks anti tank guns and anti air thousands of rounds munitions of both axis and allied sides

<text>Overloon is a village with 3,626 inhabitants on the outskirts of the Peel region, in the former municipality of Boxmeer, North Brabant. Since 2022 it has been part of the new municipality of Land van Cuijk.

Located on the outskirts is the National Museum of War and Resistance of the Netherlands, which originated as a museum for a World War II battle (&quot;Battle of Overloon&quot;) that occurred around the village from 30 September to 18 October 1944. The village is located close to the A73 motorway between Venlo and Nijmegen.

==Toponymy==

In ancient times it was simply called &quot;Loon&quot;. &quot;Loon&quot; or &quot;Lo(o)&quot; means forest with low trees, with an open meadow and swamp. The element &quot;over&quot; was added to the name much later, to distinguish it from the nearby Loon Ravenstein, Neerloon. &quot;Neder&quot; and &quot;over&quot; here means, respectively, lower and higher, or downstream and upstream.

==History==

Since the formation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the village was part of the Maashees en Overloon municipality with the nearby hamlet of Maashees. In 1942 this municipality was added to the municipality of Vierlingsbeek and in 1998 they were all included within Boxmeer. Around 1900 the village was widely spread across moorlands and poorly connected to larger towns such as Venray, Vierlingsbeek, Sambeek, Oploo en Sint Anthonis. There were about 600 people in 110 houses.

The oldest written mention of Loon is a grant of charter from Jan van Cuijk from the year 1308. Jan van Cuijk in this deed, that he recorded at St. Lawrence Church in Vierlingsbeek, gives the right to waive the (low) tax in(Over)Loon.

===Administrative and legal until 1795===

The Loon village government consisted of three aldermen, four jurors and one or two bankers. The latter were especially responsible for the finances. From the fourteenth century, the aldermen had jurisdiction together with that of an alderman of the Vierlingsbeek bank. Vierlingsbeek was the head of the four aldermen. Criminal cases had to go to the bench in Grave. This joint arrangement of aldermen was maintained until 1803. From that year, Overloon had the power to regulate the judiciary itself. This lasted only seven years, due to the unstable political situation.

Between 1794 (after the French invasion) and 1810 the territory of the Netherlands, and hence that of Overloon, was first made part of the Republic of France (1794-1795), and then successively of the Kingdom of The Netherlands (1795 - 1796), the Batavian Republic (1796-1805), the Batavian Commonwealth (1805-1806) and the Kingdom of Holland (1806-1810).

===Administration after 1810===
In 1810 the entire Dutch territory was annexed by France and became a part of the Empire of France (1810-1814). As a result, there was new legislation and a different organization of public administration and law in the Netherlands. At local level, municipalities were formed, under the direction of a mayor. The village authorities were abolished from that moment. Overloon and Maashees merged into one municipality, of which Holthees was also a part. This had the name, Maashees and Overloon. This was, in 1942, in the municipality Vierlingsbeek, which in turn, on 1 January 1998, merged with Boxmeer.

===World War II===
In 1944, Overloon was almost completely destroyed at the Battle of Overloon, officially also known as Operation Aintree, in a ten-day tank battle between a British tank division and the German army. The Germans were trying to keep the Allies from crossing the Maas. There were more than two thousand dead. Overloon was liberated on 14 October 1944, but the fighting lasted for some days longer. This is the reason for the establishment of the War Museum, which later became known as the National War and Resistance Museum and then Liberty Park.

==Places of interest==
*The Liberty Park, including the National War and Resistance Museum, opened in 1946.
*The Zoo Parc Overloon, a small zoo.
*On the path between the Liberty Park and the zoo are seven wooden sculptures produced by Marjolijn Mandersloot. They date from 2005.
*The Church of the Holy Theobaldus and Anthony of Padua is a modern church, designed by Jan Strik, with brick reliefs on the exterior walls. The parish has worshipped St. Donatus from 1884 to about 1970. There was a St. Donatus Brotherhood, but when in 1944 the statue was destroyed, this devotional worship gradually less. In 1975 the fraternity disbanded. At the back of the church is still a picture of St. Donatus.
*Schaartven is a former sand excavation site of 7 hectares. After the excavation site was closed, the total area of 23 hectares was planted and decorated by the municipality of Vierlingsbeek to which Overloon belonged to at that time. In 1995 the land was privatized. Nowadays there is a recreational lake with a beach and a fish pond.
*Hiding Chapel or Chapel of the Good Dive (Mary or Save Hide), from 1954. The chapel stands on the corner Venrayseweg / Mers Loseweg. The funds for this chapel are raised by the many hiding in Overloon during the war. The chapel is the following scripture &quot;(Isaiah 16: 3-4) Hide the refugees and betrayal them not and be for them a refuge from the destroyer.&quot;
*Overloon War Cemetery, a British war cemetery.
*Between Overloon, Maashees and Venray are the Overloon Dunes, a drift sand ridge.

In 2000 the town was given a new tourist attraction, the Zoo Parc Overloon.

==Sports==
Overloon has an amateur football club named SSS&#x27;18. The club has a fierce rivalry with nearby Vierlingsbeek&#x27;s club Volharding.

<text>Nothe Fort is a fort in Weymouth, Dorset, England, situated at the end of the Nothe Peninsula, which juts eastwards from the town of Weymouth, and Weymouth Harbour, into the sea to the north of the ex-military Portland Harbour. The fort is located next to Nothe Gardens.

The coastal defence was built between 1860 and 1872 by 26 Company of the Royal Engineers to protect Portland and Weymouth Harbours, with Portland then becoming an important Royal Navy base. Shaped like the letter D, the fort was built with bomb-proof casemates and deep magazines. The fort was abandoned in 1956 and purchased by the local council in 1961. It is now a museum and remains one of the best-preserved forts of its kind in the country.

The fort and its outer gateway have been Grade II* listed since 1974. Its fusee steps, located in Nothe Gardens, have been Grade II listed since 2000, and was constructed for hauling trolleys transporting ammunition, spares and stores from the quay to Nothe Fort. In 1978, the Nothe Fort, tramway and searchlight battery at The Nothe, also became scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

==History==
===Military===

Work began on Nothe Fort in 1860 by a civil engineering contractor, with the first stage of construction involving leveling the site and building a sea wall. After the contractor suffered financial problems, the construction work was taken over by 26 Company Royal Engineers in 1862. Although the upper earthen parapet was complete by 1869, the fort was fully commissioned in 1872 at a total cost of £117,049. It was constructed on three levels; the magazine stored the ammunition, the ground level casemates were designed to hold heavy muzzle-loaded cannons and accommodation for the soldiers manning them, and the ramparts, featuring a raised platform that could be used to fire weapons such as muskets and light muzzle-loaded cannons during attacks.

The first soldiers to be stationed at the fort were No. 2 Battery Royal Artillery (Tatton-Browns). The unit were given responsibility to install the original cannons, which were two 64 pounders, four 9-inch rifled muzzle loaders and six 10-inch cannons. During the 1890s, seven of the guns were replaced by 12.5-inch RML guns. With the introduction of breech-loading guns in the early 20th century, the RML guns were removed and replaced by three 6-inch Mark VII breechloading naval guns on the ramparts. In order to carry the 100-pound shells from the magazines, a series of hoists were installed.

In 1938 alterations were completed to allow the fort to be used as a central anti-aircraft ammunition depot for the south west, which included installing an electrically-operated hoist and the construction of a loading platform. Nothe Fort did not see combat until World War II. In July 1940, two ships entered the area and failed to identify themselves, prompting the fort to fire its guns as a warning. The two ships immediately switched on their lights, revealing themselves to be refugees from the Channel Islands. During the war, the fort was equipped with a battery of four Vickers QF 3.7-inch AA guns. The guns are sited on a purpose-built platform within the north-west corner of the fort, which was later replaced by a Bofors 40 mm gun.

It was abandoned in 1956 as it was no longer required as a coastal defence, then used by the Royal Navy to house stores and degaussing equipment.

===Recent history===
By 1961 the Navy had no further use for the fort and it was sold to Weymouth and Melcombe Regis Borough Council. Under the ownership of the council the fort remained unoccupied and quickly became a victim of vandalism, before starting to fall into a state of dereliction. During this time numerous ideas were suggested, including turning the fort into a luxury hotel complex. Work began to turn the fort into a hotel in 1971 but was soon abandoned shortly after.

In 1980, the Weymouth Civic Society took over responsibility for the fort through a lease with the borough council, allowing restoration work to begin, with assistance from the Manpower Services Scheme. Later in the 1980s, as a result of the Cold War period, part of the fort&#x27;s magazine level was used as a nuclear shelter for civil administration, which included the creation of command and accommodation areas, and the installation of heavy blast doors.

Nothe Fort has been gradually transformed into a museum and tourist attraction, where it remains open to the public today. Following the early restoration work, the fort was given a £1.8m lottery grant and a further £600,000 investment due to the involvement of local authorities and English Heritage. The fort is run by a team of five paid staff members and a dedicated team of 70 volunteers, while the Friends of Nothe Fort group has also been established to promote interest in the fort and to encourage its growth as a museum and attraction.

The museum features models, World War II memorabilia as well as original cannons, guns, British and American WWII vehicles. It has many displays, exhibits and audio-visual facilities. The courtyard often holds community events such as military festivals, concerts, dramas, and cultural Olympiad.

In 2007, a survey carried out by The National Lottery revealed the fort to be voted one of the spookiest locations in the UK.

In 2012, hundreds of individuals applied to be volunteers at the fort for the Summer Olympics. 150 people were recruited as marshals during the games, when 4,600 ticketed spectators a day flocked to the official view point for a fortnight. The fort and the gardens were closed off to the public during the games.

<text>Plasmapheresis (from the Greek πλάσμα, &quot;plasma&quot;, something molded, and ἀφαίρεσις &quot;aphairesis&quot;, taking away) is the removal, treatment, and return or exchange of blood plasma or components thereof from and to the blood circulation. It is thus an extracorporeal therapy, a medical procedure performed outside the body.

Three general types of plasmapheresis can be distinguished:
* &quot;Autologous&quot;, removing blood plasma, treating it in some way, and returning it to the same person, as a therapy.
* &quot;Exchange&quot;, a patient&#x27;s blood plasma is removed, while blood products are given in replacement. This type is called plasma exchange (PE, PLEX, or PEX) or plasma exchange therapy (PET). The removed plasma is discarded and the patient receives replacement donor plasma, albumin, or a combination of albumin and saline (usually 70% albumin and 30% saline).
* &quot;Donation&quot;, removing blood plasma, separating its components, and returning some of them to the same person, while holding out others to become blood products that this person donates for those in need. In such a plasma donation procedure, blood is removed from the body, blood cells and plasma are separated, and the blood cells are returned, while the plasma is collected and frozen to preserve it for eventual use as fresh frozen plasma or as an ingredient in the manufacture of blood products.

Plasmapheresis of the autologous and exchange types is used to treat a variety of disorders, including those of the immune system, such as Goodpasture&#x27;s syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, lupus, myasthenia gravis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

== Medical uses ==
During plasmapheresis, blood, which consists of blood cells and a clear liquid called blood plasma, is initially taken out of the body through a needle or previously implanted catheter. Plasma is then removed from the blood by a cell separator. Three procedures are commonly used to separate the plasma from the blood cells, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages:
* Discontinuous flow centrifugation: One venous catheter line is required. Typically, a 300 ml batch of blood is removed at a time and centrifuged to separate plasma from blood cells.
* Continuous flow centrifugation: Two venous lines are used. This method requires slightly less blood volume out of the body at any one time, as it is able to continuously spin out plasma.
* Plasma filtration: Two venous lines are used. The plasma is filtered using standard hemodialysis equipment. This continuous process requires that less than 100 ml of blood be outside the body at one time.

After plasma separation, the blood cells are returned to the person undergoing treatment, while the plasma, which contains the antibodies, is first treated and then returned to the patient in traditional plasmapheresis. Rarely, other replacement fluids, such as hydroxyethyl starch, may be used in individuals who object to blood transfusion but these are rarely used due to severe side-effects. Medication to keep the blood from clotting (an anticoagulant) is given to the patient during the procedure.

Plasmapheresis is used as a therapy in particular diseases. It is an uncommon treatment in the United States, but it is more common in Europe and particularly Japan.

An important use of plasmapheresis is in the therapy of autoimmune disorders, where the rapid removal of disease-causing autoantibodies from the circulation is required in addition to other medical therapy. It is important to note that plasma exchange therapy in and of itself is useful to temper the disease process, while simultaneous medical and immunosuppressive therapy is required for long-term management. Plasma exchange offers the quickest short-term answer to removing harmful autoantibodies; however, the production of autoantibodies by the immune system must also be suppressed, usually by the use of medications such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, rituximab, or a mixture of these.

Other uses are the removal of blood proteins where these are overly abundant and cause hyperviscosity syndrome.

There is weak evidence that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) might be of benefit in severe cases of COVID-19.

===Complications of plasmapheresis therapy===
Though plasmapheresis is helpful in certain medical conditions, like any other therapy, there are potential risks and complications. Insertion of a rather large intravenous catheter can lead to bleeding, lung puncture (depending on the site of catheter insertion), and, if the catheter is left in too long, it can get infected.

Aside from placing the catheter, the procedure itself has complications. When patient blood is outside of the body passing through the plasmapheresis machine, the blood has a tendency to clot. To reduce this tendency, in one common protocol, sodium citrate is infused while the blood is running through the circuit. Citrate binds to calcium in the blood, calcium being essential for blood to clot. Citrate is very effective in preventing blood from clotting; however, its use can lead to life-threateningly low calcium levels. This can be detected using the Chvostek&#x27;s sign or Trousseau&#x27;s sign. To prevent this complication, calcium is infused intravenously while the patient is undergoing the plasmapheresis; in addition, calcium supplementation by mouth may also be given.

Other complications include:
* Bleeding or hematoma from needle placement
* Hypotension
* Potential exposure to blood products, with risk of transfusion reactions or transfusion transmitted diseases
* Suppression of the patient&#x27;s immune system

== Plasma donation ==

Donating plasma is similar in many ways to whole blood donation, though the end product is used for different purposes. Most plasmapheresis is for fractionation into other products; other blood donations are transfused with relatively minor modifications. Plasma that is collected solely for further manufacturing is called Source Plasma.

Plasma donors undergo a screening process to ensure both the donor&#x27;s safety and the safety of the collected product. Factors monitored include blood pressure, pulse, temperature, total protein, protein electrophoresis, health history screening similar to that for whole blood, as well as an annual physical exam with a licensed physician or an approved physician substitute under the supervision of the physician. Donors are screened at each donation for viral diseases that can be transmitted by blood, sometimes by multiple methods. For example, donations are tested for HIV by ELISA, which shows if they have been exposed to the disease, as well as by nucleic acid methods (PCR or similar) to rule out recent infections that the ELISA test might miss and are also screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Industry standards require at least two sets of negative test results before the collected plasma is used for injectable products. The plasma is also treated in processing multiple times to inactivate any virus that was undetected during the screening process.

In a few countries, plasma (like blood) is donated by unpaid volunteers. In others, including the United States, Austria, Germany and some Canadian facilities plasma donors are paid for their donations. Standards for donating plasma are set by national regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union, and by a professional organization, the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (or PPTA), which audits and accredits collection facilities. A National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR) is also maintained by the PPTA for use in keeping donors with prior positive viral antibody test results from donating at any facility.

Almost all plasmapheresis in the US is performed by automated methods. In some cases, automated plasmapheresis is used to collect plasma products like fresh frozen plasma for direct transfusion purposes, often at the same time as plateletpheresis. These procedures are performed at facilities such as community blood centers.

Since returning red cells causes the body to replace plasma more rapidly, a donor can provide up to a liter of plasma at a time and can donate with only a few days between donations, unlike the 56-day deferral for blood donation. The amount allowed in a donation varies vastly from country to country, but generally does not exceed two donations, each as much as a liter (one-third of the total plasma volume), per seven-day period. If a significant amount of red blood cells cannot be returned, the donor may not donate for 56 days, just as if they had donated a unit of blood. Depending on the collection system and the operation, the removed plasma may be replaced by saline. The body typically replaces the collected volume within 24 hours, and donors typically donate up to twice a week, though this varies by country.

The collected plasma is promptly frozen at lower than -20 °C (-4 °F) and is typically shipped to a processing facility for fractionation. This process separates the collected plasma into specific components, such as albumin and immunoglobulins, most of which are made into medications for human use. Sometimes the plasma is thawed and transfused as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), much like the plasma from a normal blood donation.

; Manual method
: For the manual method, approximately the same as a whole blood donation is collected from the donor. The collected blood is then separated by centrifuge machines in separate rooms, the plasma is pressed out of the collection set into a satellite container, and the red blood cells are returned to the donor.
: The danger with this method was that if the wrong red blood cells were returned to the donor, a serious and potentially fatal transfusion reaction could occur. Requiring donors to recite their names and ID numbers on returned bags of red cells minimized this risk. This procedure has largely become obsolete in favor of the automated method.
; Automated method

: The automated method uses a very similar process. The difference is that the collection, separation, and return are all performed inside a machine connected to the donor through a needle in the arm, typically the antecubital vein. There is no risk of receiving the wrong red cells. The devices used are very similar to the devices used for therapeutic plasmapheresis, and the potential for citrate toxicity is similar. The potential risks are explained to prospective donors at the first donation, and most donors tolerate the procedure well. In the UK in 2020, plasma donation is sought from volunteers who have recovered from COVID-19. 

; Antibodies
: Donors are sometimes immunized against agents such as tetanus or hepatitis B so that their plasma contains the antibodies against the toxin or disease. In other donors, an intentionally incompatible unit of blood is transfused to produce antibodies to the antigens on the red cells. The collected plasma then contains these components, which are used in manufacturing of medications. Donors who are already ill may have their plasma collected for use as a positive control for laboratory testing.

== History ==
Plasmapheresis was originally described by doctors Vadim A. Yurevick and Nicolay Rosenberg of the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy of Saint Petersburg in 1913. and John Abel and Leonard Rowntree of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1914. Both studies carried out on animals, are considered precedent to subsequent studies held in humans and offered the first description of the technique. The first studies of the effects of plasmapheresis on humans were undertaken during the WWII period, and the results were reported in a study over six plasma donors presented by doctors Co Tui, F.C. Bartter and A.M. Wright in 1944.

Aware of the rising demand for plasma for transfusion, Dr. Josep Antoni Grífols-Lucas conducted the first systematic study of the application of plasmapheresis in a series of plasma donors. Performed in 1951, this was the most exhaustive study to date of the medium-term effects on the human body, and involved more than 320 plasmapheresis procedures. Grifols-Lucas concluded that it was possible for donors to undergo plasmapheresis on a weekly basis without the quality of their plasma suffering, while the method also made it possible to obtain a larger quantity of plasma when compared to the conventional method of whole blood donation. The results of the study were presented at the 4th International Congress of Blood Transfusion in Lisbon (1951), and were published in 1952 in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and Medicina Clínica in Spain.

At the Lisbon congress, Grifols-Lucas met Edwin Cohn. While Grifols-Lucas was presenting a safe technique for obtaining large quantities of plasma from healthy donors, Cohn presented a plasma fractionator, a device that separated out the proteins contained in plasma. These two major contributions marked the birth of a new industry: plasma fractionation to obtain plasma products. In 1955, further data were presented at the 5th Congress of the European Hematology Society, in Freiburg, Germany, based on the ongoing performance of plasmapheresis over a five-year period. In 1956 Grifols-Lucas presented the results at the 6th Congress of the International Hematology Society in Boston, US.

Michael Rubinstein was the first to use plasmapheresis to treat an immune-related disorder when he saved the life of an adolescent boy with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in 1959. The modern plasmapheresis process itself originated in the U.S. National Cancer Institute between 1963 and 1968, where investigators drew upon an old dairy creamer separation technology first used in 1878 and refined by Edwin Cohn&#x27;s centrifuge marketed in 1953.

In 1965, Dr. Víctor Grifols-Lucas, brother of Josep Antoni Grifols-Lucas, patented the device, along with the procedure for performing plasmapheresis &quot;in situ&quot;, that is, with the donor present. This replaced a fragmented, manual process with a continuous automatic method which enabled blood components to be extracted, separated and returned to the donor in a single procedure. The new device made plasmapheresis faster and simpler, and also made it safer for donors.

<text>The University of Cádiz (in Spanish: Universidad de Cádiz), commonly referred to as UCA, is a public university located in the province of Cádiz, Andalusia, Spain, noted for its medicine and marine sciences curricula. It was founded in 1979, and has the Latin motto &quot;Non Plus Ultra&quot; (&quot;No Further Beyond&quot;). Its headquarters are located in Cádiz, where the Rectorate is. During the 2007/2008 academic year, there were 17,280 students, 1,698 lecturers, and 680 administration and services workers associated with the university.

== History ==

The University&#x27;s origins lie in the 15th century with the &quot;Colegio de Pilotos de los Mares de Levante y Poniente&quot;.

Its Faculty of Medicine traces its founding to the Royal Naval College of Surgery in 1748, which was the first in Europe to combine medicine and surgery in a single school.

The modern University of Cádiz was founded on October 30, 1979, with an inaugural session &quot;Cajal, análisis literario de un carácter&quot; about Ramón y Cajal and the first rector election was conducted in 1984.

In March 1984, the Gold Medal was awarded to Juan Carlos I of Spain. In May 1985, Rafael Alberti and Antonio Domínguez Ortiz were invested Doctor Honoris Causa. In this year, the rectorate is relocated to the current building, &quot;Casa de los Cinco Gremios&quot;. University bylaws and statutes were approved in February 1986.

In 1992, &quot;Centro Andaluz Superior de Estudios Marinos&quot; was inaugurated in Campus of Puerto Real.

Since 2003, UCA has promoted new technologies for learning-related purposes, first with WebCT virtual campus and then Moodle (free software).

In 2009, the recently created &quot;General Inspection of Exceptional Services&quot; begun to make decisions which were severely reprobed by some intellectual authors, for it allows authorities the use of official means in order to arbitrarily punish teaching staff.

<doc id="1002607" wikidata="Q2264329" url="?curid=1002607" title="Abdominal aorta">
<text>In human anatomy, the abdominal aorta is the largest artery in the abdominal cavity. As part of the aorta, it is a direct continuation of the descending aorta (of the thorax).

==Structure==
The abdominal aorta begins at the level of the diaphragm, crossing it via the aortic hiatus, technically behind the diaphragm, at the vertebral level of T12. It travels down the posterior wall of the abdomen, anterior to the vertebral column. It thus follows the curvature of the lumbar vertebrae, that is, convex anteriorly. The peak of this convexity is at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3).
It runs parallel to the inferior vena cava, which is located just to the right of the abdominal aorta, and becomes smaller in diameter as it gives off branches. This is thought to be due to the large size of its principal branches. At the 11th rib, the diameter is 122mm long and 55mm wide and this is because of the constant pressure. The abdominal aorta is clinically divided into 2 segments:
# The suprarenal abdominal or paravisceral segment, inferior to the diaphragm but superior to the renal arteries.
# The Infrarenal segment, inferior to the renal arteries and superior to the iliac bifurcation.

===Branches===

The abdominal aorta supplies blood to much of the abdominal cavity. It begins at T12 and ends at L4 with its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries and usually has the following branches:

The bifurcation (union) of the inferior vena cava is at L5 and therefore below that of the bifurcation of the aorta.

# inferior phrenic a.
# celiac a.
## left gastric a.
## splenic a.
### short gastric arteries (6)
### splenic arteries (6)
### left gastroepiploic a.
### pancreatic arteries
## common hepatic a.
### right gastric a.
### gastroduodenal a.
#### right gastroepiploic a.
#### superior pancreaticoduodenal a.
### right hepatic a.
#### cystic a.
### left hepatic a.
# superior mesenteric a.
## inferior pancreaticoduodenal a.
## jejunal and ileal arteries
## middle colic a.
## right colic a.
## ileocolic a
### anterior cecal a.
### posterior cecal a. – appendicular a.
### ileal a.
### colic a.
# middle suprarenal a.
# renal a.
# testicular or ovarian a.
# four lumbar arteries
# inferior mesenteric a.
## left colic a.
## sigmoid arteries (2 or 3)
## superior rectal a.
# median sacral a.
# common iliac a.
## external iliac a.
## internal iliac a.

===Relations===
The abdominal aorta lies slightly to the left of the midline of the body. It is covered, anteriorly, by the lesser omentum and stomach, behind which are the branches of the celiac artery and the celiac plexus; below these, by the lienal vein (splenic vein), are the pancreas, the left renal vein, the inferior part of the duodenum, the mesentery, and the aortic plexus.

Posteriorly, it is separated from the lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral fibrocartilages by the anterior longitudinal ligament and left lumbar veins.

On the right side it is in relation above with the azygos vein, cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, and the right crus of the diaphragm—the last separating it from the upper part of the inferior vena cava, and from the right celiac ganglion; the inferior vena cava is in contact with the aorta below.

On the left side are the left crus of the diaphragm, the left celiac ganglion, the ascending part of the duodenum, and some coils of the small intestine.

===Relationship with inferior vena cava===
The abdominal aorta&#x27;s venous counterpart, the inferior vena cava (IVC), travels parallel to it on its right side.
* Above the level of the umbilicus, the aorta is somewhat posterior to the IVC, sending the right renal artery travelling behind it. The IVC likewise sends its opposite side counterpart, the left renal vein, crossing in front of the aorta.
* Below the level of the umbilicus, the situation is generally reversed, with the aorta sending its right common iliac artery to cross its opposite side counterpart (the left common iliac vein) anteriorly.

===Collateral circulation===
The collateral circulation would be carried on by the anastomoses between the internal thoracic artery and the inferior epigastric artery; by the free communication between the superior and inferior mesenterics, if the ligature were placed between these vessels; or by the anastomosis between the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal pudendal artery, when (as is more common) the point of ligature is below the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery; and possibly by the anastomoses of the lumbar arteries with the branches of the internal iliac artery.

<doc id="1002640" wikidata="Q939378" url="?curid=1002640" title="Abrasion (medicine)">
<text>An abrasion is a partial thickness wound caused by damage to the skin. It can be superficial, which involves only the epidermis, or deep, which involves the deep dermis. Abrasions usually involve minimal bleeding. Mild abrasions, also known as &quot;grazes&quot; or &quot;scrapes&quot;, do not scar or bleed because the dermis is left intact, but deep abrasions that disrupt the normal dermal structures may lead to the formation of scar tissue. A more traumatic abrasion that removes all layers of skin is called an avulsion.

Abrasion injuries most commonly occur when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface, causing a grinding or rubbing away of the upper layers of the epidermis.

==By degree==

* A first-degree abrasion involves only epidermal injury.
* A second-degree abrasion involves the epidermis as well as the dermis and may bleed slightly.
* A third-degree abrasion involves damage to the subcutaneous layer and the skin and is often called an &quot;avulsion&quot;.

==Treatment==
The abrasion should be cleaned and any debris removed. A topical antibiotic (such as neomycin or bacitracin) should be applied to prevent infection and to keep the wound moist. Dressing the wound is beneficial because it helps keep the wound from drying out, providing a moist environment conducive for healing. If the abrasion is painful, a topical analgesic (such as lidocaine or benzocaine) can be applied, but for large abrasions, a systemic analgesic may be necessary. Avoid exposing abraded skin to the sun as permanent hyperpigmentation can develop.

<doc id="1002654" wikidata="Q837025" url="?curid=1002654" title="Washington State Route 900">
<text>State Route 900 (SR 900) is a state highway serving part of King County, Washington, United States. It travels between southern Seattle and the Eastside suburbs of Renton and Issaquah, separated by the Issaquah Alps. The highway terminates to the west at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Tukwila and to the east at I-90 in Issaquah, and also has intermediate junctions with I-405 and SR 167 in Renton.

SR 900 was created in the 1964 state highway renumbering, but the corridor had been part of the state highway system since 1909. It was originally a section of the Sunset Highway, the main cross-state route between Seattle and Spokane and was designated as U.S. Route 10 (US 10) in 1926. After the opening of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, US 10 was moved to a new highway and the former alignment through Renton became an alternate route and a branch of Primary State Highway 2 that was replaced by SR 900. The highway originally terminated at an interchange with I-90 in Seattle&#x27;s Rainier Valley, but was truncated in 1991.

==Route description==

SR 900 begins as an extension of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South at an intersection with Boeing Access Road, east of its interchange with I-5 under an elevated section of the Central Link light rail line, near the Allentown neighborhood of northern Tukwila. The four-lane highway splits at a basketweave interchange with I-5, with the southbound lanes of SR 900 traveling over the freeway twice. The roadway continues southeast into Skyway whilst parallel to I-5 and the BNSF South Seattle railyard. SR 900 turns east and becomes Sunset Boulevard as it enters Renton, following the Black River and a BNSF branch railroad, to an intersection with SR 167 at Rainier Avenue.

The highway splits into a couplet on 2nd and 3rd streets for several blocks in downtown Renton, serving the Renton transit center, before returning to two-way traffic at a bridge over the Cedar River, downstream of the Renton branch of the King County Library System. SR 900 then continues east, around the northwest side of Liberty Park, before turning north to briefly parallel I-405 after its interchange with SR 169. The highway then joins I-405 in a short concurrency for , traveling east through Renton&#x27;s suburbs towards the East Renton Highlands. The highway transitions into a two-lane country road, entering unincorporated King County while following Tibbetts Creek northeastward between Cougar and Squak mountains, part of the Issaquah Alps highlands. SR 900 enters Issaquah as the four-lane 17th Avenue, passing the Issaquah park and ride, before ending at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-90 south of Lake Sammamish State Park.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2014, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 900 was at its bridge over the Cedar River in downtown Renton, carrying 48,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was on the eastbound lanes of the one-way pair in Renton, carrying 6,300 vehicles.

==History==
The road now designated SR 900 was originally added to the state highway system in 1909, as an extension of the Snoqualmie Pass Road (State Road 7) which was completed for through traffic across the pass in 1915. At the time the highway was the main thoroughfare between Seattle and Spokane, with a route then around the south end of Lake Washington. In 1913 the highway was renamed the Sunset Highway, which is still an informal moniker today.

The road became State Road 2 in 1923 and Primary State Highway 2 in 1937. In 1926 the highway was co-designated to be part of US 10. The legislature in 1931 also designated the route as part of the Washington Loop Highway.

The opening of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge across Lake Washington in 1940 moved US 10/PSH 2 to the direct route, and the old alignment became Alternate US 10 and PSH 2 RE (for Renton). In 1955, Alternate US 10 was dropped, and it became SR 900 in 1964.

After April 1, 1992, the stretch of SR 900 between I-90 exit 3 at Rainier Avenue and along Martin Luther King Jr. Way to the Boeing Access Road was dropped from the officially designated highway. The west end of SR 900 is now milepost 5.93 due to this truncation; the east end is milepost 21.64.

WSDOT plans to construct a roundabout on SR 900 at South 129th Street in Skyway to address a high number of collisions; from 2012 to 2022, 931 collisions had been recorded on the highway between I-5 and Renton, with four fatalities.

<text>Nasir Khusraw (; 1004 – between 1072–1088) was an Isma&#x27;ili poet, philosopher, traveler, and missionary () for the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate.

Despite being one of the most prominent Isma&#x27;ili philosophers and theologians of the Fatimids and the writer of many philosophical works intended for only the inner circle of the Isma&#x27;ili community, Nasir is best known to the general public as a poet and writer who ardently supported his native Persian tongue as an artistic and scientific language. All of Nasir&#x27;s philosophical Isma&#x27;ili works are in Persian, a rarity in the Isma&#x27;ili literature of the Fatimids, which primarily used Arabic.

Nasir was a key figure in the spread of Isma&#x27;ilism in Central Asia. He is with great reverence called &quot;Pir&quot; or &quot;Shah Sayyid Nasir&quot; by the Isma&#x27;ili community of Badakhshan (split between Afghanistan and Tajikistan) and their branches in northern Pakistan, who all consider him to be their founder.

== Name ==
Nasir Khusraw&#x27;s full name was Abu Mu&#x27;in Hamid al-Din Nasir ibn Khusraw ibn Harith al-Qubadiyani al-Marvazi, which he would generally refer himself by in his prose philosophical works. In his book &quot;Safarnama&quot;, he mostly calls himself &quot;Nasir&quot;, and in his poetry he mostly uses the pen-name &quot;Hujjat&quot;, a title meaning &quot;proof&quot;, which he had received by the Isma&#x27;ili missionary organisation in Cairo. In his poetry he also sometimes use the names of &quot;Nasir&quot; and &quot;Khusraw&quot;, the latter being a Persian name, which according to historian Dr C. Alice Hunsberger &quot;would certainly have been a point of great pride to this defender of Persian culture and language.&quot; His name is also transliterated as Nasir-i Khusraw and Naser-e Khosrow.

==Life==
Nasir is the subject of many tales, including a fake autobiography that bears his name and has been passed around between Isma&#x27;ilis and non-Isma&#x27;ilis for many centuries. The writings of Nasir that are still in existence offer insightful information about his life and philosophy. Yet, it appears that the majority of these manuscripts were censored to remove any references to Isma&#x27;ilism by antagonistic Sunni scribes. A native Persian, Nasir was from a family of government bureaucrats and landowners. He most likely adhered to the Twelver Shi&#x27;ism form of Islam before his conversion to Isma&#x27;ilism. He was born in 1004 in Qubadiyan, a neighborhood of the city of Balkh, which was part of the Marw province in the Khurasan region. The area was then controlled by the Ghaznavids, a culturally Persianised dynasty of Turkic slave origin.

Nasir supposedly started his career as a scribe before moving to the city of Marw to work as a financial administrator. He was allowed entry to the court at Balkh until in 1040, when Khurasan was conquered by the Seljuks. He retained his office under the Seljuks, whose co-founder Chaghri Beg ruled Khurasan. Around the age of 41, Nasir underwent a tremendous and sudden change in his spirituality, which drastically altered the direction of his life. According to Nasir, the incident had the characteristics of a dream. He subsequently resigned from his office and converted to Isma&#x27;ilism.

In December 1045, Nasir made the decision to embark on a prolonged journey with the ultimate goal of performing a pilgrimage to Mecca. In March 1046, along with his brother Abu Sa&#x27;id and an Indian attendant, he started his journey, which would first end after nearly seven years. From Khurasan, he travelled west, passing through northern and western Iran, Armenia, and Asia Minor. He then descended to Syria, Palestine, and then Arabia, where he performed his pilgrimage. On August 1047, he went to Cairo in Egypt, which served as the capital of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate. 

The Fatimid Caliphate was the first and last significant Shi&#x27;i dominion until the emergence of the Safavid dynasty of Iran in 1501, who declared Twelver Shi&#x27;ism as its official religion. The majority of other governmental power bases were overwhelmingly Sunni, including the Ghaznavid and Seljuk rulers, who demonstrated their support for the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad by making determined efforts to put an end to Isma&#x27;ili activity, especially that of Isma&#x27;ili missionaries operating under the Fatimid caliph. At Cairo, Nasir was taught Isma&#x27;ili teachings, law, and administration by prominent scholars. He met al-Mu&#x27;ayyad fi&#x27;l-Din al-Shirazi (died 1087), an Isma&#x27;ili scholar from Shiraz in southwestern Iran, who had also recently arrived to Cairo. He became Nasir&#x27;s teacher, instructing him in enigmatic Isma&#x27;ili concepts and philosophy.

Nasir was raised to the position of &quot;dā‘ī&quot; &quot;missionary&quot; and appointed as the &quot;Hujjat-i Khorasan&quot;, though the hostility he encountered in the propagation of these new religious ideas after his return to Greater Khorasan in 1052 A.D. and Sunnite fanaticism compelled him at last to flee. After wandering from place to place, he found refuge in Yamgan (about 1060 A.D.) in the mountains of Badakhshan, where he spent as a hermit the last decades of his life, gathering a considerable number of devoted adherents, who have handed down his doctrines to succeeding generations.

Nasir-i Khusraw explained that through revelation (&quot;tanzil&quot;), intellectual matters were transformed into a state that could be understood by humankind. Esoteric interpretation (&quot;ta’wil&quot;) is necessary to revert them to their original intellectual state. He also said that one must not be satisfied with the exoteric form but look for the person who can explain the original esoteric meaning to them. In saying this he alluded to the Imam of the Time.

He died in Yamagan in present-day northern Afghanistan. He was buried in a small mausoleum on a small hill in the present-day village of Hadrat-i Sayyid (also called Hadrat-i Sa&#x27;id), on the eastern side of the Koksha Valley in present-day Afghanistan. According to an engraved inscription on the structure, it was renovated in 1697.

==Works==
*Safarnama ()
Safarnama (The Book of Travels) is his most famous work. He visited dozens of cities in about seven years (March 6, 1046 – October 23, 1052) and wrote comprehensively about them, including details about colleges, caravanserais, mosques, scientists, kings, the public, the population, the area of the cities, and, of course, his interesting memories. After 1000 years, his &quot;Safarnama&quot; is still readable for Persian-speaking people.

*Diwan ()
Among his other works, most of the lyrical poems in his Diwan were composed in his retirement, and their chief topics are an enthusiastic praise of Ali, his descendants, and al-Mustansir in particular, along with passionate outcries against Khorasan and its rulers, who had driven him from his home. It also explores his immense satisfaction with the quiet solitude of Yumgan, and his utter despondency again in seeing himself despised by his former associates and excluded from participation in the glorious contest of life. Scattered through all these alternating outbursts of hope and despair, there are lessons of morality, and solemn warnings against the tricks and perfidy of the world, the vanity of all earthly splendour and greatness, the folly and injustice of men, and the hypocrisy, frivolity and viciousness of fashionable society and princely courts in particular.

*Gushayish va Rahayish ()
Another work of Nasir Khusraw is the Persian philosophical work &quot;Gushayish va Rahayish&quot; which has been translated into English by F.M. Hunzai under the title: &quot;Knowledge and Liberation&quot;. The work discusses creation, questions related to the soul, epistemology, and Ismaili Islamic doctrines. From a linguistic point of view, the work is an example of early philosophical writing in new Persian.

It is the same strain which runs, although in a somewhat lower key, through his two larger &quot;masnavis&quot;, the Rawshana-i-nama () (or Book of Enlightenment, also known as &quot;Shish Fasl&quot;), and the Sa&#x27;datnama (Book of Felicity). The former is divided into two sections: the first, of a metaphysical character, contains a sort of practical cosmography, chiefly based on Avicenna&#x27;s theories, but frequently intermixed both with the freer speculations of the well-known philosophical brotherhood of Basra, the Ikhwan al-Safa, and purely Shi&#x27;ite or Isma&#x27;ili ideas; the second, or ethical section of the poem, abounds in moral maxims and ingenious thoughts on man&#x27;s good and bad qualities, on the necessity of shunning the company of fools and double-faced friends, on the deceptive allurements of the world and the secret snares of ambitious men craving for rank and wealth. It concludes with an imaginary vision of a beautiful work of spirits who have stripped off the fetters of earthly cares and sorrows and revel in the pure light of divine wisdom and love.

If we compare this with a similar allegory in Nasir&#x27;s &quot;Diwan&quot;, which culminates in the praise of Mustansir, we are fairly entitled to look upon it as a covert allusion to the eminent men who revealed to the poet in Cairo the secrets of the Isma&#x27;ili faith, and showed him what he considered the heavenly ladder to superior knowledge and spiritual bliss.

A similar series of excellent teachings on practical wisdom and the blessings of a virtuous life, only of a more severe and uncompromising character, is contained in the &quot;Sa&#x27;datnama&quot;; and, judging from the extreme bitterness of tone manifested in the reproaches of kings and emirs, we should be inclined to consider it a protest against the vile aspersions poured out upon Nasir&#x27;s moral and religious attitude during those persecutions which drove him at last to Yumgan.

Of all other works of the author, the Zaad-al-Musafirin (or Travelling Provisions of Pilgrims) and the Wajh-i Din (or The Face of Religion) are theoretical descriptions of his religious and philosophical principles; the rest of them can be dismissed as being probably just as apocryphal as Nasir&#x27;s famous autobiography (found in several Persian &quot;tadhkiras&quot; or biographies of poets), a mere forgery of the most extravagant description, which is mainly responsible for the confusion in names and dates in older accounts of our author.

* Wajh-i din ()
Nasir Khusraw, explains the spiritual interpretation of the tradition of a six day creation of the physical universe. He writes about how the story of creation is a symbolic explanation of what happened when God created the universe. Interpreting it literally is something human beings do based on the limits of their intellects. In the scriptures, when it says that God began the work of creating the world on Sunday, completed it on Friday, and then rested on Saturday, it is not a literal account, rather a symbolic one.

When the Prophets shared the story of a six-day creation of the physical universe, it was meant for the people to understand that God was saying that six prophets would come into this world and command people to work. When the seventh day came, God would not command in this manner, but would rather reward them for their hard work.

*Book on Mathematics ()
Nasir Khusraw wrote a book on mathematics which has now been lost. He states in his other work that he could: &quot;not find one single scholar throughout all of Khorasan and eastern lands like myself [who] could grapple with the solutions to these problems&quot;. But he felt it his responsibility to take the task for readers he would never see, &#x27;those yet to come, in a time yet to come&#x27;

*Jamiʿ al hikmatayn ()

== Legacy and assessment ==
Despite being one of the most prominent Isma&#x27;ili philosophers and theologians of the Fatimid era and the writer of many philosophical works intended for only the inner circle of the Isma&#x27;ili community, Nasir is best known to the general public as a poet and writer who ardently supported Persian as an artistic and scientific language. All of Nasir&#x27;s philosophical Isma&#x27;ili works are in Persian, a rarity in the Isma&#x27;ili literature of the Fatimids, which primarily used Arabic.

Nasir was a key figure in the spread of Isma&#x27;ilism in Central Asia. He is with great reverence called &quot;Pir&quot; or &quot;Shah Sayyid Nasir&quot; by the Isma&#x27;ili community of Badakhshan (split between Afghanistan and Tajikistan) and their branches in northern Pakistan, who all consider him to be their founder. Devotees that visit Nasir Khusraw&#x27;s mausoleum also refer him by other names than &quot;Nasir Khusraw&quot;, such as &quot;shāh&quot; (king), &quot;shāh-i buzurgvār&quot; (great king), &quot;mawlā&quot; (guardian), &quot;shīd-i Yumgān&quot; (sun of Yumgan), and &quot;uqāb-i Yumgān&quot; (eagle of Yumgan). The latter refers to one of Nasir Khusraw&#x27;s poems, written to offer moral advice; The narrative, which is based on an ancient fable, describes an eagle circling in the sky &quot;full of selfish pride&quot; before being brought to the ground by an arrow with eagle feathers sewn into its fletch. The final lines of the poem convey a lesson, which has become a well-known saying amongst speakers of the Persian language; &quot;az māst ki bar māst&quot; (&quot;what comes from us returns to us&quot;), meaning that people possess the very characteristic that will determine both their success and failure.

<text>Capricorn Records was an independent record label founded by Phil Walden and Frank Fenter in 1969 in Macon, Georgia. Capricorn Records is often credited by music historians as creating the southern rock genre.

==History==
===Label and studio founding===
In the early 60s, Phil Walden and his brother Alan Walden had made a family business of managing and representing R&amp;B performers including Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Al Green, and Percy Sledge. As Redding&#x27;s fame grew internationally, the partners founded Redwal Music, purchased a four-building block in downtown Macon, and opened a small office space a few blocks away on Cotton Avenue. After Otis Redding&#x27;s death in 1967, Phil Walden continued their shared dream for a recording studio, but the initial plan for an R&amp;B driven label no longer held its original appeal without Redding.

Walden and Frank Fenter approached Vice President of Atlantic Records Jerry Wexler about funding the project. Wexler liked Walden&#x27;s idea of a studio with studio musicians but thought the studio should also include a record label. They decided to call the label and studio “Capricorn” after their shared astrological sign. With a monetary investment from Wexler and a distribution deal with Atlantic Records, Capricorn Records was close to completion in 1969 with a production deal with Atlantic Records. Walden began looking for talent, both musicians and engineers.

===First incarnation: the 1970s===
Between the time Redding and the Walden brothers purchased the studio property and Phil Walden&#x27;s partnership with Wexler, the studio was called the Otis Redding Memorial Studio. Under both names, the space blended into its surroundings and from the outside looked like an old, abandoned storefront with no outside signage among other similarly vacant buildings. The inside of the space was reminiscent of a warehouse – high ceilings and open space.

Jim Hawkins originally designed the main recording studio, and a redesign followed in 1972 by Tom Hidley. According to docents at the Mercer Music at Capricorn, the Hidley redesign changed the studio walls from soundproof tiles to walls with a fabric-covered upper half and a stone and wood bottom half. Strips of cedar shingles placed strategically throughout the room covered lights and further diffused sound. Four echo chambers built under the studio connected directly to the control room to create popular vocal and instrumental echo effects.

Musicians remember the atmosphere of the studio referring to it as “home” or recollecting that anything could happen or anyone could stop by. Elvin Bishop called Capricorn Records &quot;the only thing happening in town that was different from anything in a thousand other towns around the South at the time&quot;.

Walden planned to model the studio after Stax Records and FAME Studios by offering an intimate recording experience with state-of-the-art equipment and a backing studio band. The Capricorn Rhythm Section provided a distinctive full-band sound to artists or on tracks needing accompaniment. Often referred to as CRS, the studio band members were drummer Johnny Sandlin, keyboardist Paul Hornsby, guitarist Pete Carr, and bassist Robert “Pops” Powell.

When it came time to start recruiting talent, Walden tracked down Duane Allman, a guitarist who he heard on a FAME Studios recording of Wilson Pickett&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; ultimately purchasing Allman&#x27;s contract. Allman would go on to help Walden build what would become the Allman Brothers Band. Though the Allman Brothers&#x27; 1969 self-titled first release wasn&#x27;t a best-seller, critics praised the effort for its mixing of country, jazz, blues, and rock genres. Music historians cite the group&#x27;s third release, &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, as the impetus of the rise of southern rock as a popular music genre. &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; was the first gold album for both the band and label. The partnership would garner more top-charting releases with &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;, &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;.

Between the years of 1969 and 1979, Capricorn produced nine platinum albums, seventeen gold albums, and five gold singles. Other Capricorn-signed artists had chart-topping songs and albums, but the studio also held sessions for other artists including Razzy Bailey, Martin Mull, the Charlie Daniels Band, and Livingston Taylor just to name a few.

Other notable Capricorn artists during this era included:
* Bonnie Bramlett
* The Cooper Brothers
* Cowboy
* Delbert McClinton
* Fallenrock
* Dixie Dregs
* Grinderswitch
* Hydra
* Kitty Wells
* The Marshall Tucker Band
* Percy Sledge
* Sea Level
* Stillwater
* Wet Willie
* White Witch

===End of an era===
When Warner Brothers could not successfully negotiate a buyout of the label in 1975, Capricorn made a new distribution deal with PolyGram. In the following year Capricorn&#x27;s most successful and prolific act, the Allman Brothers Band, would split up.

The 1970s recession affected Capricorn record sales, especially later in the decade. Between July and September 1979, the label faced numerous foreclosure and debt charges including a possible buyout and contract renegotiation from PolyGram forcing the label to close its Los Angeles office and cut positions in Macon. When renegotiations were unsuccessful, PolyGram filed a lawsuit seeking all label and studio assets as collateral on a $5 million loan made to the company in 1977.

At this point, many artists terminated their contracts with Capricorn including Sea Level, Stillwater, and Dixie Dregs and the Allman Brothers filed suit to stop the release of a greatest hits album.

Together, Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and the reorganization of Capricorn Records took a total of 18 months. The reorganization allowed Walden to retain the label name, studio, Cotton Avenue office, and both Rear Exit and No Exit Music Companies. Polygram received all master recordings, musical copyrights, existing tapes, records, and other property. Another stipulation of the final agreement was the creation of a special fund to pay off other creditors over the next seven years. Walden received 100% of the company stock after reorganization, leaving Fenter out.

In January, 1983, Walden and Fenter restructured their business partnership and announced that Capricorn was releasing its first record in three years with the CBS Columbia Label album &quot;Sweet Young Thing&quot; by Rick Christian. The album did not revive the label&#x27;s name recognition as Walden and Fenter had hoped, but neither partner was deterred. Fenter made an attempt in July 1983 to revive the label, but that effort dissolved when he had a heart attack in the midst of completing negotiations with Warner Bros. Records and died at 47.

A Capricorn Records liquidation sale event at the Macon Coliseum in the summer of 1986 saw the sale of assets including gold records, personal effects, and filing cabinets containing financial documents, press, and promotional pieces, and contracts.

===Second incarnation: the 1990s===
The label relaunched in Nashville, Tennessee as a joint venture with Warner Brothers, this time through the partnership of Walden and his son. The first act to sign onto the resurrected label was Athens, Georgia&#x27;s Widespread Panic and they released their first album on the label in the summer of 1991.

Cake and 311 were the most commercially successful artists to come out of Capricorn during this period with Cake&#x27;s third album &quot;Prolonging the Magic&quot; going platinum and 311&#x27;s &quot;Soundsystem&quot; going gold. Capricorn&#x27;s Nashville division signed a then-unknown Kenny Chesney while the Atlanta division signed various rock acts including jam band favorites like Gov&#x27;t Mule and Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit.

Throughout the label&#x27;s run in the 1990s, distribution changed from Sony Music&#x27;s independent RED Distribution network to PolyGram by way of its flagship label Mercury Records. In 1997, Capricorn closed its Nashville office moving all operations to its downtown Atlanta office. Walden sold Capricorn to Volcano Records in 2000 for $13 million and began work on a new independent label project, Velocette Records, which featured Georgia artists including Vic Chesnutt, Kevn Kinney, and Jucifer.

===Studio renovation and reopening===
In 2010, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation listed the Capricorn Recording Studio among its annual “Places in Peril.” Leading up to this announcement, the Capricorn Sound Studios sat vacant during the decades after the label declared bankruptcy, surviving a fire that destroyed neighboring buildings. The studio remained untouched while the rest of the property fell into further disrepair throughout the early 2000s. Studio tours were available to fans through special reservations as featured in an episode of NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

In 2015, a multi-million dollar renovation project through a partnership between Mercer University, NewTown Macon, Sierra Development, and Southern Pines Plantations announced plans to fully restoring the original studio space, early plans included a large recording studio for film score and orchestral recordings, a Capricorn museum, and loft apartments on the upper floors.

While the record label is defunct, the legacy of Capricorn lives on through Mercer Music at Capricorn. On December 3, 2019, on the 50th anniversary of the original studio opening, the original studio space reopened. Grants from the Peyton Anderson Foundation and John S. and James L. Knight Foundation along with historic tax credits and donations made up the $4.3 million project&#x27;s funding.

In addition to the loft apartments on the upper floors, the four-building remodel includes a small bar and lounge-style entrance, a museum with interactive kiosks, a music incubator space designed for musicians to collaborate creatively or store equipment, rental office space, and two recording studio spaces. Studio B is both a performance venue and large studio space designed acoustically for choirs, orchestral recording, and film scoring. Studio A, the original historic Capricorn recording studio, remains unchanged from Hidley&#x27;s 1972 studio redesign. The main control room remains mostly unchanged except for a custom 40-channel API console based on the original soundboard.

==Economic and cultural impact==
From the early to mid-1970s, Capricorn&#x27;s economic impact on Macon and the surrounding area included more than just the studio and label. The southern city had gained notoriety as having a vibrant music scene, keeping small venues like Grant&#x27;s Lounge, historic halls like the Grand Opera House and the Macon City Auditorium, and large venues like the Macon Coliseum filled with internationally known acts and up-and-coming talent. As a company, Capricorn invested in local real estate including Capricorn Park on Cotton Avenue.

Further putting Macon and Capricorn Records in the spotlight was Phil Walden&#x27;s involvement in the 1976 presidential campaign of then Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. Capricorn label bands including the Allman Brothers Band and Marshall Tucker Band played rallies and benefit concerts and Carter chose &quot;The South&#x27;s Gonna Do It&quot; by the Charlie Daniels Band to be his campaign song.

Walden&#x27;s interest in politics wasn&#x27;t the only activity bringing attention to his company or hometown. His annual Barbecue and Summer Games held at his lakeside home from 1972 to 1978, attracted both fans and stars. Notable attendees throughout the years included Carter, Don King, Bette Midler, and Andy Warhol.

Internationally, a special production of the &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; called &quot;Macon Whoopee&quot; featured performances by the Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, Bonnie Bramlett, Stillwater, and others.

<doc id="1002659" wikidata="Q24738" url="?curid=1002659" title="Achilles tendinitis">
<text>Achilles tendinitis, also known as Achilles tendinopathy, is soreness of the Achilles tendon. It is accompanied by alterations in the tendon&#x27;s structure and mechanical properties. The most common symptoms are pain and swelling around the back of the ankle. The pain is typically worse at the start of exercise and decreases thereafter. Stiffness of the ankle may also be present. Onset is generally gradual.
Achilles tendinopathy is idiopathic, meaning the cause is not well understood. Theories of causation include overuse such as running, a lifestyle that includes little exercise, high-heel shoes, rheumatoid arthritis, and medications of the fluoroquinolone or steroid class. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and examination.
Proposed interventions to treat tendinopathy have limited or no scientific evidence to support them, such as pre-exercise stretching, strengthening calf muscles, avoiding over-training, adjustment of running mechanics, and selection of footwear. Treatment is symptomatic and non-specific such as rest, ice, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. People who are not satisfied with symptomatic treatment may be offered surgery. Achilles tendinitis is relatively common.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms can vary from an ache or pain and swelling in the local area of one or both ankles, or a burning that surrounds the whole joint. With this condition, the pain is usually worse during and after activity, and the tendon and joint area can become stiff the following day, as swelling impinges on the movement of the tendon.

Achilles tendon injuries can be separated into insertional tendinopathy (20%–25% of the injuries), midportion tendinopathy (55%–65%), and proximal musculotendinous junction (9%–25%) injuries, according to the location of pain.

==Cause==

Achilles tendinitis is a common injury, particularly in sports that involve lunging and jumping, occurs both laterally and bilaterally, and is often induced in a single ankle by trauma. It is also a known side effect of fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, as are other types of tendinitis.

Achilles tendinitis is thought to have physiological, mechanical, or extrinsic (i.e. footwear or training) causes. The Achilles tendon has a generally poor blood supply throughout its length, as measured by the number of vessels per cross-sectional area. Blood is supplied via the synovial sheaths that surround it. This lack of blood supply can lead to the degradation of collagen fibers and inflammation. Tightness in the calf muscles has also been known to be involved in the onset of Achilles tendinitis.

During the loading phase of the running and walking cycle, the ankle and foot naturally pronate and supinate by approximately 5 degrees. Excessive pronation of the foot (over 5 degrees) in the subtalar joint is a type of mechanical mechanism that can lead to tendinitis.

An overuse injury refers to repeated stress and strain, which is likely the case in endurance runners. Overuse can simply mean an increase in running, jumping or plyometric exercise intensity too soon. Another consideration would be the use of improper or worn-down footwear, which lack the necessary support to maintain the foot in the natural/normal pronation.

==Pathophysiology==
Because the Achilles tendon does not have good blood supply, injuries can be slow to heal. The tendon receives nutrients from the tendon sheath or paratendon. When an injury occurs to the tendon, cells from surrounding structures migrate into the tendon to assist in repair. Some of these cells come from blood vessels that enter the tendon to provide direct blood flow to increase healing. With the blood vessels come nerve fibers. Researchers including Alfredson and his team in Sweden believe these nerve fibers to be the cause of the pain - they injected local anaesthetic around the vessels and this decreased significantly the pain in the Achilles tendon.

==Diagnosis==

Achilles tendinitis is usually diagnosed from a medical history, and physical examination of the tendon. Projectional radiography shows calcification deposits within the tendon at its calcaneal insertion in approximately 60 percent of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can determine the extent of tendon degeneration, and may show differential diagnoses such as bursitis.

==Prevention==

Performing consistent physical activity will improve the elasticity and strength of the tendon, which will assist in resisting the forces that are applied.

Stretching before beginning an exercise session is often recommended, however evidence to support this practice is limited. Prevention of recurrence includes following appropriate exercise habits and wearing low-heeled shoes. In the case of incorrect foot alignment, orthotics can be used to properly position the feet. Footwear that is specialized to provide shock-absorption can be utilized to defend the longevity of the tendon. Achilles tendon injuries can be the result of exceeding the tendon&#x27;s capabilities for loading, therefore it is important to gradually adapt to exercise if someone is inexperienced, sedentary, or is an athlete who is not progressing at a steady rate.

Eccentric strengthening exercises of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are utilized to improve the tensile strength of the tendon and lengthen the musculotendinous junction, decreasing the amount of strain experienced with ankle joint movements. This eccentric training method is especially important for individuals with chronic Achilles tendinosis which is classified as the degeneration of collagen fibers.

==Treatment==
Treatment typically involves rest, ice, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. A heel lift or orthotics may also be helpful, but evidence for either is limited. Foam rolling may increase range of motion, but there is only weak evidence for the direct treatment of stiffness. Other treatments include:
* An eccentric exercise routine designed to strengthen the tendon.
* Application of a boot or cast.

===Injections===
The evidence to support injection therapies is poor.
* This includes corticosteroid injections. These can also increase the risk of tendon rupture.
* Autologous blood injections - results have not been highly encouraging and there is little evidence for their use.

===Procedures===
Tentative evidence supports the use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of Achilles tendinitis varies among different ages and groups of people. Achilles tendinitis is most commonly found in individuals aged 30–40 Runners are susceptible, as well as anyone participating in sports,
and men aged 30–39.

Risk factors include participating in a sport or activity that involves running, jumping, bounding, and change of speed. Although Achilles tendinitis is mostly likely to occur in runners, it also is more likely in participants in basketball, volleyball, dancing, gymnastics and other athletic activities. Other risk factors include gender, age, improper stretching, and overuse. Another risk factor is any congenital condition in which an individual&#x27;s legs rotate abnormally, which in turn causes the lower extremities to overstretch and contract; this puts stress on the Achilles tendon and will eventually cause Achilles tendinitis.

<text>The Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan organization in the world, founded in the United Kingdom in 1944 by Donald Watson, Elsie Shrigley, George Henderson and his wife Fay Henderson among others.

==History==

In November 1944, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester Vegetarian Society, who identified as a non-dairy vegetarian, started a newsletter called &quot;The Vegan News&quot;, sub-titled &quot;Quarterly Magazine of the Non-Dairy Vegetarians&quot;. Watson coined the term &quot;vegan&quot; to describe a vegetarian diet devoid of all animal-derived ingredients such as dairy and eggs. He derived the term from the word vegetarian by taking its first three letters and its last two letters because &quot;veganism starts with vegetarianism and carries it through to its logical conclusion&quot;. However, Watson credited founding members G. A. Henderson and his wife Fay K. Henderson as originating the idea of the word &quot;vegan&quot; as they had suggested the name &#x27;Allvega&#x27; with &#x27;Allvegan&#x27; to be used as the title of his magazine. It was from this that the term vegan was taken by Watson.

Watson had given a talk to the Vegetarian Society on the use of dairy products in December 1943 and a summary was published in their journal,
&quot;The Vegetarian Messenger&quot; in March 1944. A few months later Watson and Shrigley requested to form a sub-group of non-dairy vegetarians within the Vegetarian Society. There were arguments from vegetarians against the formation of a non-dairy group within its organization. It was considered but its trustees felt that its inclusion might not be comfortable for its vegetarian membership and it was suggested that the non-dairy vegetarians should form their own society. 

In November 1944 a meeting on the formation of The Vegan Society was held at the Attic Club, 144 High Holborn in London. Those who attended were Donald Watson, Elsie Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Barbara Moore observing. According to Shrigley, the day of the founding meeting was &quot;a Sunday, with sunshine and a blue sky – an auspicious day for the birth of an idealistic movement&quot;. During the same month, The Vegan Society published their manifesto with two aims:
1. To advocate that man&#x27;s food should be derived from fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains and other wholesome non-animal products and that it should exclude flesh, fish, fowl, eggs, honey, and animal&#x27;s milk, butter, and cheese.
2. To encourage the manufacture and use of alternatives to animal commodities.

When The Vegan Society was being formed, Watson&#x27;s newsletter was sent to 500 readers, and its successor, &quot;The Vegan&quot; first published in 1946, ran to a 
thousand copies. Watson was editor of &quot;The Vegan&quot;. In 1946, he became first president of The Vegan Society. Other presidents were William Collier in 1947, Frank Mayo in 1949 and Elsie Shrigley in 1951. In the late 1940s and 1950s The Vegan Society was affiliated with the International Vegetarian Union and took part in their international congresses. Despite clashing with the vegetarian movement through misunderstandings in its early years, by the late 1940s The Vegan Society worked in harmony with the Vegetarian Society and other organizations. In 1957, president John Heron lectured on veganism at a meeting in Colwyn Bay sponsored by the North Wales Vegetarian Society.

The London Group of The Vegan Society was formed in 1945. It&#x27;s secretary was Frank Mitchell (1889–1959) a chemist and Quaker. In 1949, the Yorkshire Group of The Vegan Society held a meeting in Huddersfield. Mrs. M. B. Rawls a speaker at the meeting argued that the production of dairy and eggs were inseparable from cruelty. Eva Batt of The Vegan Society lectured on veganism at Eastbourne Central Library Lecture Hall in 1968. She talked about how plant proteins contain all the essential amino-acids and predicted that plant milks would have a future in the nutritional field.

In 1988, The Vegan Society reported having 4000 members. 

===World Vegan Day===

The founding of the Society is celebrated annually on 1 November, World Vegan Day. The day was established in 1994 by Louise Wallis, the then chairperson; however, the actual date of founding is thought to have been either 5 or 12 November 1944. In 2011, Wallis said: &quot;We knew the Society had been founded in November 1944 but didn’t know the exact date, so I decided to go for 1 November, partly because I liked the idea of this date coinciding with Samhain/Halloween and the Day of the Dead - traditional times for feasting and celebration, both apt and auspicious.&quot;

===Vegan Eatwell Guide===

The Vegan Society has produced a Vegan Eatwell Guide adapted from the Public Health England&#x27;s Eatwell Guide under terms of the Open Government Licence. The guide includes a pictorial representation of a balanced vegan diet emphasising the consumption of fruits, legumes, vegetables and whole grains. It includes the use of fortified foods and supplementation.

==Definition==

In 1945, Watson and committee members of The Vegan Society defined veganism as &quot;the practice of living on fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains, and other wholesome non-animal products&quot;. Writing in 1947, Fay K. Henderson commented that There has been much conjecture as to the origin of the word VEGAN and its meaning. It is therefore interesting to realise that in the first instance it was an attempt to get beyond the rather negative phrase &quot;non-dairy vegetarian&quot; which was originally applied to the founders of The Vegan Society. The word indicates an all vegetable base and is a restricted form of vegetarian, being both the beginning and the end yet implying hopefully that what starts as vegetarian may finish as vegan.

In 1951, Leslie Cross an animal rights activist and vice-president of The Vegan Society commented that &quot;The object of the Society shall be to end the exploitation of animals by man&quot;; and &#x27;The word veganism shall mean the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals&quot;. In 1954, Elsie Shrigley stated that the word veganism was &quot;clearly defined&quot;. The 1954 definition was &quot;The Society affirms that man has no right to exploit animals, advocates that man&#x27;s food should be derived from fruits, nuts, vegetables, vegetables and grains, and encourages the use of alternatives to all products of animal origin&quot;.

The definition of veganism was amended over the years into an ethical philosophy. In 1965, veganism was defined by the Society as &quot;a way of living which excludes all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, the animal kingdom, and includes a reverence and compassion for all life&quot; and described its practice as living on only products from the plant kingdom.

In the 1990s, the Society&#x27;s membership was using a dietary definition of veganism. In 1996, Richard Farhall of The Vegan Society commented that &quot;there are many definitions of vegan, but for membership of the Society we define it in dietary terms, where a vegan is someone who doesn&#x27;t eat any animal products including fish, poultry, eggs, animal milks, honey or their derivatives&quot;.

The Vegan Society currently defines veganism as &quot;a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.&quot;

==Activities==
* Information – The Vegan Society provides information on all aspects of vegan living on their website, from their nutritional pages such as Vitamin B12: the key facts to the how and why of going vegan, to lifestyle articles and blogs. Their 30 Day Vegan Pledge has been running since 2008, each day providing a recipe, tips, and advice on going vegan. The Vegan Society also offer tools for activists such as free leaflets and advice on effective outreach.
* Campaigns – The Vegan Society campaigns on multiple issues. Current campaigns involve improving hospital catering and their &#x27;Grow Green&#x27; campaign, whereby farmers are incentivized to move from animal farming towards plant protein crops.
* Support – The Vegan Society provides support via its UK network of local contacts as well as a free email-in service.
* Vegan Trademark – the label ensures all products and its derivatives are free from animal ingredients and testing. The Vegan Society defines &#x27;animal&#x27; as all vertebrates and invertebrates, meaning its policy does not allow testing on insects, water fleas or any other creature.
* &quot;The Vegan&quot; – the charity publishes a quarterly magazine sent free to members.
* Since June 2020, The Vegan Society has a podcast, called &quot;The Vegan Pod&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Animal Liberation Front===

In 1992, Arthur Ling the then vice-president of The Vegan Society argued that the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) had tried to infiltrate the Society and had started a smear campaign against him by falsely accusing him of animal cruelty. Ling stated that ALF had published leaflets about him and spread rumours that he had been sacked as president of the Society for killing mice in his factory. Ling who chaired many of the Society&#x27;s annual general meetings claimed that there was an anonymous letter circulating from ALF requesting specific members to be voted onto the council and there was an uproar when he requested instead for a postal vote. During this time, the only elected council member involved with ALF was Robin Webb, their press officer who denied all allegations. Richard Farhall general secretary of the Society confirmed that anonymous letters had been sent to members but there was no reference to ALF. Ling&#x27;s son Adrian told the Society&#x27;s council that he has used mouse poison in his father&#x27;s factory but his father had not been involved.

Ling was not sacked as president; he was voted out at election in 1991. In 1992, Ling stated &quot;at a time when higher proportion of the British public is turning to vegetarianism and veganism, the Society cannot afford to be seen as an ALF front&quot;.

===Eshe Kiama Zuri===

In 2021, complaints were made against Eshe Kiama Zuri, former vice-chairperson of The Vegan Society, who made a series of controversial posts deemed offensive and racist on social media. In response, Zuri accused other members of The Vegan Society of being racist. Zuri, who describes themself as disabled and non-gendered, argued that although veganism was coined by a white man it had been built on indigenous and non-western ancestral traditions in Africa and Asia. She argued that this was not being acknowledged by its members, and that they had been &quot;forced out&quot; of the Society by a smear campaign.

The Vegan Society commissioned Ijeoma Omambala, QC, to investigate such claims. Omanbala in her report found that the complainants did not present any evidence to support the alleged claims of racism but that some of Zuri&#x27;s posts had been unprofessional and inappropriate and noted that Zuri had been misgendered in meetings at the Society. Zuri and four other trustees resigned prior to the completion of mediation. The Vegan Society have published a summary of Omambala&#x27;s report on their website and have released a public statement claiming &quot;as with many charities, The Vegan Society has a number of challenges that we must address as we evolve into an even more diverse and inclusive organisation.&quot;

==Movement for Compassionate Living==
A breakaway group from The Vegan Society, the Movement for Compassionate Living, was founded in 1984 by the former Vegan Society secretary Kathleen Jannaway and her husband Jack.

<text>Interstate 287 (I-287) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US states of New Jersey and New York. It is a partial beltway around New York City, serving northern New Jersey and the counties of Rockland and Westchester in New York. I-287, which is signed north–south in New Jersey and east–west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in Edison, New Jersey, clockwise to the New England Thruway (I-95) in Rye, New York, for . Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In Bridgewater Township, the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by US Route 202 (US 202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. Upon entering New York at Suffern, I-287 turns east on the New York State Thruway (I-87) and runs through Rockland County. After crossing the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge, I-287 splits from I-87 near Tarrytown and continues east through Westchester County on the Cross Westchester Expressway until it reaches the New England Thruway. Within New Jersey, I-287 is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), and, within New York, it is maintained by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA).

A bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as Interstate 187 (I-187), opened in 1960 as Interstate 487 (I-487) before becoming part of I-287 a year later. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the Middlesex Freeway. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US 202 in Montville opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder was completed by 1994. The aging Tappan Zee Bridge was replaced with a new span which opened in stages between 2017 and 2018.

A proposed tunnel across the Long Island Sound between Rye and Oyster Bay on Long Island would link the eastern terminus of I-287 to New York State Route 25 (NY 25) and NY 135 in Syosset.

===New Jersey===

====Middlesex County====

I-287 begins at an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in Edison in Middlesex County, New Jersey, where the freeway continues east as Route 440 toward Perth Amboy and Staten Island. Within Middlesex County, I-287 is called the Lt. Col. (Ret) Richard F. Lauer, US Army Highway. From this point, it heads west as an eight-lane freeway through suburban areas, soon reaching an interchange with US 1 that also has access to County Route 531 (CR 531) in the southbound direction. Past this point, the road turns more to the northwest and passes under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27;s Bonhamtown Industrial Track line and a railroad spur before it comes to the junction with Route 27 (Lincoln Highway). Following Route 27, I-287 narrows to six lanes and passes over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor as it continues to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with CR 501.

As the freeway continues into South Plainfield, it passes near several business parks and comes to a partial interchange with Durham Avenue which only has a northbound exit and southbound entrance. At this point, the road starts to turn more west before it comes to a full junction with CR 529. Here, the road enters Piscataway and reaches an interchange with CR 665 (Washington Avenue). Continuing near more business parks, I-287 comes to the exit for South Randolphville Road. Following this interchange, the road heads west more before it turns to the southwest and comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 18. After Route 18, the freeway comes to the CR 622 (River Road) exit.

====Somerset County====

After crossing over the Raritan River, I-287 enters Franklin Township, Somerset County, and becomes the Captain (Ret) Joseph Azzolina, US Navy Highway. Soon after the river, there is an interchange with CR 527. After CR 527, the freeway makes a turn to the northwest and passes a mix of residential areas and business parks. The road has an interchange with CR 623 (Weston Canal Road) before crossing the Raritan River again and continuing into Bridgewater Township. Within Bridgewater Township, I-287 curves north-northwest and passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27;s Lehigh Line and then both NJ Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line and CR 533 near TD Bank Ballpark, which is home to the Somerset Patriots baseball team. Past this area, the road encounters Route 28 at an interchange. Past Route 28, the freeway turns northwest and passes over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Middle Brook Industrial Track line before it intersects US 22 at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and entrance and southbound entrance. From this point, I-287 makes a turn to the west and runs to the north of US 22 as it has a wide median. The freeway turns northwest as it passes near the Bridgewater Commons shopping mall and reaches a partial interchange with US 202/US 206. Through the remainder of New Jersey, US 202 parallels the course of I-287. At this point, I-287 gains a local–express lane configuration, with three local and two express lanes southbound and three express and three local lanes northbound. Both the southbound local and express lanes have access to southbound US 202/US 206 at this interchange, whereas northbound US 202/US 206 only has access to the local lanes of northbound I-287.

From here, the road continues north past suburban residential areas, with the northbound direction narrowing to two local lanes, before entering Bedminster. Here, I-287 intersects I-78 at the Vincent R. Kramer Interchange, where the local–express lane configuration ends. Access from eastbound I-78 to southbound I-287 is only to the local lanes. Meanwhile, the express lanes of northbound I-287 provides access to westbound I-78 while the local lanes provide access to eastbound I-78. Following I-78, I-287 heads north with four northbound lanes and three southbound lanes into more wooded surroundings, reaching another interchange with US 202/US 206. At this point, the freeway median widens again as it turns northeast before continuing more to the east and entering Far Hills. Within Far Hills, the road passes under CR 512 before the northbound direction narrows to three lanes and the wide median ends. Entering Bernards Township, I-287 runs east-northeast to an interchange with CR 525. After the CR 525 interchange, the road gains a wide median that narrows again before the road runs under NJ Transit&#x27;s Gladstone Branch, heading more to the northeast. Before leaving Bernards Township, there is an exit for North Maple Avenue.

====Morris County====

A short distance after this interchange, I-287 enters Harding Township, Morris County, at the crossing of the Passaic River, where it becomes the Marine Hector Cafferata Jr. Cong. Medal of Honor Highway. It continues northeast, with US 202 running a short distance to the west. The freeway makes a turn more to the east as it comes to a truck-only rest area in the northbound direction. The road crosses into Morris Township, where it reaches an exit-only interchange with Harter Road; there are no entrances present. Shortly after Harter Road, there is a junction with CR 663 (James Street) that only has entrances to I-287. After this, I-287 turns north and enters Morristown, where the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the median narrows. The freeway enters more developed areas as it comes to the Route 124 interchange. From this point, the road becomes eight lanes total, with four in each direction, as it passes west of Morristown Medical Center. After crossing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line, it reaches the exit for CR 510. From CR 510, I-287 makes a turn to the northeast, crossing back into Morris Township before continuing into Hanover Township. Here, the route comes to the western terminus of the Route 24 freeway and becomes ten lanes total. Following Route 24, the freeway passes over the Morristown and Erie Railway&#x27;s Whippany Line before it intersects Route 10 and becomes nine lanes, with five southbound and four northbound. I-287 passes near several business parks as it enters Parsippany–Troy Hills. In this area, there is an interchange with CR 511 east of Lake Parsippany that also has access to Entin Road in the southbound direction. After this, I-287 widens to eleven lanes with five northbound lanes, two express southbound lanes, and four local southbound lanes as it comes to the I-80 junction.

Following this interchange, the freeway becomes six lanes, with three in each direction as it continues into more wooded areas and reaching an exit with access to US 46 and US 202/CR 511. In this area, the highway runs to the west of the Boonton Reservoir and immediately to the east of US 202/CR 511. I-287 comes to the Intervale Road exit, which carries US 202 and CR 511. The freeway enters Boonton, where it turns northeast, with NJ Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line located a short distance to the northwest. In Boonton, there is another interchange with US 202/CR 511. From here, I-287 curves more to the east, with US 202 running immediately to the north of the road. Along this stretch, there is an exit for US 202 and Vreeland Avenue. Upon entering Montville, the passes near wooded residential areas before coming to another interchange with US 202. I-287 continues northeast from this point, drawing away from US 202, crossing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line before running north-northeast through more woodland as the terrain starts to get more mountainous. This stretch of I-287 continues for before its next exit. The freeway runs through Kinnelon, where the northbound direction has four lanes, and Pequannock Township before entering Riverdale. In Riverdale, there is an interchange with Route 23. A short distance later, I-287 reaches the CR 694 interchange which provides access to CR 511 Alternate (CR 511 Alt.).

====Passaic and Bergen counties====

Immediately after this, I-287 crosses over the Pequannock River and New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line into Bloomingdale, Passaic County, where the highway becomes US Air Force Gunner Clarence &quot;Red&quot; Mosley Highway. The road continues northeast and turns north as it briefly passes through Pompton Lakes before crossing into Wanaque. Here, the road makes a turn northeast again as it comes to the CR 511 Alternate interchange. After this, I-287 passes through rock cuts in the Ramapo Mountains before making a sharp turn east as it crosses high above the Wanaque River valley on a bridge. The freeway continues into Oakland, Bergen County, where the name becomes Army Staff Sergeant Walter Bray Highway.

Here, there are a couple of businesses near the road before the interchange with Skyline Drive. Following this, the road crosses the Ramapo River before passing near neighborhoods and reaching a junction with US 202. After US 202, I-287 turns southeast and closely parallels the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway line to the southwest before coming to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 208 at the Franklin Lakes borough line. Past this interchange, I-287 narrows to four lanes and turns northeast as the railroad line draws away. The freeway passes wooded residential neighborhoods prior to turning north and entering Mahwah, where it continues near more wooded suburban areas as well as the Campgaw Mountain Reservation to the west of the road. After passing to the east of the Ramapo College campus, I-287 passes over US 202. The freeway crosses the Ramapo River again before reaching an interchange with Route 17. At this point, Route 17 forms a concurrency with I-287 and the road widens to six lanes as it passes between the Ramapo Valley County Reservation to the west and business parks to the east.

===New York===

====New York State Thruway====
Upon entering New York in the village of Hillburn in the town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York, New Jersey&#x27;s Route 17 ends and NY 17 follows I-287 as the road comes to an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-87). At this point, NY 17 splits north onto I-87 and I-287 joins I-87 on the eight-lane New York State Thruway, passing over Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Port Jervis Line as it heads east out of the mountains into suburban residential and commercial surroundings as it narrows to six lanes. After passing through the village of Montebello, the freeway reaches an interchange with Airmont Road where it becomes the border between Montebello to the north and the village of Airmont to the south. Continuing to the east, the New York State Thruway becomes the border between Monsey and Airmont before separating Monsey from the village of Chestnut Ridge to the south as it turns slightly to the east-southeast. After briefly running along the south edge of the village of Spring Valley, where there is a westbound toll gantry for trucks, the highway fully enters Chestnut Ridge. In this area, it comes to the Thruway&#x27;s Garden State Parkway Connector. Following this junction, I-87/I-287 continues east into the town of Clarkstown, coming to an exit for NY 59. After this, the road passes to the north of Nanuet, crossing under NJ Transit/Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line. The freeway crosses under NY 304 before the cloverleaf interchange with the Palisades Interstate Parkway. As the Thruway continues into West Nyack, it passes under CSX Transportation&#x27;s River Subdivision line before coming to the exit for NY 303 that provides access to the Palisades Center shopping mall to the south of the road.
Past NY 303, I-87/I-287 turns to the east-southeast and passes near wooded areas as well as suburban neighborhoods of Central Nyack. It comes to another interchange with NY 59 that also provides access to US 9W. Within this interchange, the roadway has an eastbound toll gantry for the Tappan Zee Bridge that allows tolls to be collected at highway speeds using E-ZPass or toll by mail. At this point, the New York State Thruway widens to eight lanes and turns to the south-southeast into the village of Nyack in the town of Orangetown, crossing over US 9W prior to passing near residential areas in the village of South Nyack as it runs to the east of US 9W, descending into the Palisades. The last interchange in Rockland County is with US 9W and has no southbound exit. From here, the New York State Thruway crosses the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge east into the village of Tarrytown in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County. After passing over the river, the road crosses over Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line. After this, the freeway comes to the exit for US 9 that also serves the western terminus of NY 119. I-87/I-287 continues east past woodland and business parks, leaving Tarrytown. The two routes then split; I-87 continues south on the New York State Thruway, while I-287 heads east on the Cross Westchester Expressway. This interchange also has access to and from the northbound Saw Mill River Parkway and NY 119.

====Cross Westchester Expressway====

The Cross Westchester Expressway, which is maintained by the NYSTA, is six lanes wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY 119 that is intertwined with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY 119/Saw Mill River Parkway. After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Saw Mill River, the road enters the village of Elmsford and runs through developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY 9A that does not have an eastbound exit. The Cross Westchester Expressway turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway. I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues to the exit for NY 100A. After the NY 100A interchange, the freeway leaves Elmsford and turns to the east near residential areas, narrowing to six lanes before coming to an exit for NY 100 and NY 119 that also has access to the Bronx River Parkway.

Following this exit, the road becomes eight lanes again and crosses over the Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx River, and Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line. Here, the road crosses into White Plains and reaches an interchange with NY 22. Past NY 22, I-287 makes a sharp curve to the south as it narrows to six lanes and runs near inhabited neighborhoods. The road has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the Central Westchester Parkway, a road that provides access to the Taconic State Parkway by way of NY 22. The freeway runs past commercial areas to the east of downtown White Plains as it encounters Westchester Avenue, which connects to NY 119, NY 127, and Anderson Hill Road as well as The Westchester shopping mall in the downtown area. Within this interchange, the Cross Westchester Expressway turns east along the border between Harrison to the north and White Plains to the south. Westchester Avenue becomes a frontage road for I-287 as the road passes corporate parks to the north and populated neighborhoods to the south.

The road begins to turn southeast as it comes to a directional interchange with the southern terminus of I-684. The I-287 freeway heads south along the White Plains–Harrison border before turning east and fully entering Harrison, where there is a cloverleaf interchange with the Hutchinson River Parkway. At this interchange, the Westchester Avenue frontage road serves as a collector–distributor road. The Cross Westchester Expressway turns southeast again past wooded areas of development, with NY 120 coming onto the Westchester Avenue frontage road. I-287 reaches an interchange where the frontage road ends as Westchester Avenue heads east as NY 120A and NY 120 continues to the south. Here, the freeway enters the village of Rye Brook in the town of Rye as it continues southeast. The Cross Westchester Expressway comes into the village of Port Chester, where the road runs near more dense suburban development as it intersects US 1. At this point, the road has ramp access to and from the southbound direction of the New England Thruway (I-95). From here, the mainline I-287 narrows to four lanes and enters the city of Rye, where it passes over the Northeast Corridor before merging into northbound I-95 about a half-mile () west of the Connecticut state line.

==History==

===New Jersey===

In the 1950s, a limited-access highway was proposed to bypass New York City. This planned beltway would be incorporated into the new Interstate Highway System. The proposed beltway in New Jersey was designated as FAI Corridor 104 and later received the I-287 designation in 1958. The southern segment of I-287 was planned in the 1950s as the Middlesex Freeway, which was to run from the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island and follow the Route 440 corridor to Edison, where it would connect to the New Jersey Turnpike before continuing west to I-78. From here, the freeway would parallel US 202 north to the New York border. The anticipated cost of building I-287 in New Jersey was $235 million (equivalent to $ in ). The southernmost part of I-287 in Middlesex County was intended to be signed as part of I-95 instead; this never happened due to the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway. By the mid-1960s, I-287 had been completed between the New Jersey Turnpike and Bedminster and from US 46 in Parsippany to US 202 in Montville. More of I-287 in New Jersey had been finished by 1969, with the sections from US 46 south to Route 10 in Hanover Township and from Bedminster north to Maple Avenue in Bernards Township opened. The segment of the highway between Maple Avenue and Route 24 opened in 1973, followed by the segment between Route 24 and Route 10 in early 1975, making I-287 a continuous road between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US 202 in Montville.
I-287&#x27;s missing section between US 202 in Montville and the New York State Thruway in Suffern, New York, was controversial dating back to 1965 and continuing until its opening in 1993. Property owners along the proposed route fought its completion as part of the freeway revolts of the 1960s and 1970s. Originally, I-287 was proposed to take a more eastern route through the Lincoln Park and Wayne areas; this routing gained opposition as it passed through populated areas. A more western alignment was planned through mountainous areas in 1973, but this was rejected as the cost of building the road through the mountains was too high. In 1977, the current alignment of I-287 was proposed between Montville and Suffern; this was approved by the federal government in 1982 as it was less costly than the western alignment and went through less developed areas than the eastern alignment.

Permits allowing construction to begin on this segment were issued in 1988 by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Officials in Rockland County, New York filed a lawsuit on November 19, 1993, hours before the highway&#x27;s official ribbon-cutting, seeking to block its opening. They claimed the incomplete interchange with the New York State Thruway was inadequate to handle the additional traffic. That interchange was not complete until 1994, but the highway opened as planned on November 19 in a ceremony held on the Wanaque River bridge, where New Jersey Governor James Florio cut the ribbon. This moment marked the completion of a bypass around New York City that had been planned for decades. The portion of I-287 between the US 202 interchange in Oakland and the Route 208 interchange in Franklin Lakes overtook the westernmost portion of Route 208, truncating that route to its current location.
The completion of I-287 in New Jersey had significant effects on traffic and development patterns in the area. Several towns along the highway, such as Wanaque and Montville, saw increases in development. In addition, as the road was a bypass, it saw a significant increase in truck traffic wishing to bypass congested roads closer to New York City. The road also increased truck traffic on other north–south corridors, such as Route 31, from truckers wanting to bypass the New Jersey Turnpike by using these surface roads to get between the I-287 bypass of New York City and I-95 south to Pennsylvania. On July 16, 1999, Governor Christine Todd Whitman banned oversize trucks from using roads that are not part of the National Highway System, such as Route 31. Trucks were therefore forced to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike to travel across the state. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) were built along I-287 between Bedminster and Parsippany. These HOV lanes, along with the ones that had been built on I-80, were opened to all traffic in 1998 due to lack of HOV usage, and the state did not have to repay the federal government the $240 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build the lanes. In 2011, a small section of the northbound side of the highway in Boonton collapsed into the Rockaway River due to Hurricane Irene. Near the end of that year, five people and a dog were killed when a small SOCATA TBM 700 airplane en route to Georgia crashed on the highway near exit 33 in Morris Township.

In August 2007, NJDOT started the I-287 (Middlesex Freeway) Rehabilitation Project to resurface the pavement between exit 5 in South Plainfield and I-95/New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, which is used by about 150,000 vehicles daily. Some of the bridges and overpasses had deteriorated to such a state that they needed to be replaced. On September 16, 2009, NJDOT announced the start of another rehabilitation and repaving project from exit 5 in Piscataway to the area of exit 10 in Franklin Township. This project, which was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, cost $29 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was finished by April 2011.

===New York State Thruway===
The New York State Thruway portion of I-287 was planned around 1950 as part of a tolled limited-access highway that was to connect the major cities of New York. A bridge across the Hudson River was planned between Nyack and Tarrytown at a site that was close enough to New York City but far enough from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey&#x27;s jurisdiction area, as they opposed the crossing. The portion of the Thruway currently followed by I-287, including the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, opened on December 15, 1955. In the 1960s, I-287 was designated along the New York State Thruway between Suffern and Tarrytown, while I-87 ran farther to the east on present-day I-684. On January 1, 1970, the I-87 designation was shifted onto this portion of the New York State Thruway to run concurrent with I-287.

The E-ZPass electronic toll collection system was first introduced on this segment of the Thruway at the Spring Valley and Tappan Zee Bridge toll plazas in 1993. The same year, an interchange in Suffern opened providing access to the newly opened New Jersey portion of I-287. In 1997, tolls for cars were eliminated at the Spring Valley toll plaza, with tolls remaining for trucks and other commercial vehicles. The I-87/I-287 interchange split near Tarrytown began a $187-million (equivalent to $ in ) reconstruction in 2001 in order to add additional lanes and rebuild overpasses and underpasses. Reconstruction in this area was completed in May 2004. In 2016, the Tappan Zee Bridge toll plaza was demolished and replaced with an electronic toll gantry on the west side. The Spring Valley toll plaza went all-electronic in 2018.

===Cross Westchester Expressway===

Plans for a limited-access road to cross Westchester County east to west date back to the 1920s and became more needed after post-World War II traffic increases. When the Tappan Zee Bridge was proposed around 1950, the Cross Westchester Expressway was becoming a more realistic idea. Construction of the freeway began in 1956, and was given the NY 119 designation. The design of the highway met Interstate Highway standards after opening and was supposed to have the I-187 designation. However, by the time the highway opened in 1960, it was officially designated as I-487 instead. At a cost of $50 million (equivalent to $ in ), the Cross Westchester Expressway was opened December 1960. 

In 1961, this segment of road was redesignated I-287 to make it a part of the beltway around New York City. I-287 was to continue past I-95 in Port Chester and was to cross Long Island Sound via the unbuilt Oyster Bay–Rye Bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;nassau/suffolk66plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On Long Island, the route would run along the Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway (NY 135). Then, I-287 was again to be extended into Jones Beach by merging with the Wantagh State Parkway in Merrick. The plans for the bridge, and the I-287 extension onto Long Island, were dropped in 1973 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a result of community opposition and environmental concerns.

Ownership of the Cross Westchester Expressway was transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the NYSTA in 1990 to help relieve the state&#x27;s budget issues. 

On July 27, 1994, a propane truck crashed into an overpass on the Cross Westchester Expressway in White Plains and exploded, killing the driver. The fire from the explosion spread into adjacent neighborhoods and injured 23 people.

 Since 1999, the Cross Westchester Expressway has been under construction in order to reduce congestion and improve safety for the motorists who use the highway. The final phase of the project, a reconstruction in the area of exit 8 in White Plains, was completed in December 2012, nine months ahead of schedule.

In late 2018, NYSDOT began installing ramp meters on entrance ramps to I-287 in Rockland and Westchester Counties. More are expected to be installed by 2020.

===Tappan Zee Bridge replacement===

The Tappan Zee Bridge, carrying the concurrency of New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, was a cantilever bridge built during 1952–1955. The bridge was long and spanned the Hudson at its second-widest point. Before its replacement in 2017, the deteriorating structure carried an average of 138,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000 vehicles per day. Part of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million (equivalent to $ in ). Unlike other major bridges in the New York metropolitan area, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50 years. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee&#x27;s replacement to be dual-span twin bridges. Construction officially began in October 2013, with the new spans being built to the north of the existing bridge. The new bridge connects to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks.

The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new bridge and the old bridge closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/E traffic shifted&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge&#x27;s eastbound span opened to traffic on September 11, 2018. Upon completion, the new Tappan Zee Bridge became one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.

==Future==

In 2008, a private firm, Polimeni Associates, proposed to construct a more than tunnel across Long Island Sound between Rye and Oyster Bay. This proposed tunnel would be the longest highway tunnel in the world, with its length exceeding that of the Lærdal Tunnel in Norway by . It would start at the junction with the Cross Westchester Expressway and the New England Thruway in Rye and end at NY 135 and NY 25 in Syosset. Estimated to cost approximately $10 billion, it would feature three tubes: the outer tubes would have three lanes of vehicular traffic each and the inner tube would be used for maintenance. The proposed tunnel, which is to be operated by a private firm, is still awaiting approval to begin construction.

==Memorial designations==

I-287 has been designated as the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway since 1995. There are signs on the highway and sections are named in honor of Korean War veterans. The Morris County portion is designated for U.S. Marine Corps veteran Hector Cafferata Jr., a Medal of Honor recipient. The Bergen County portion is designated for U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Walter Bray, and the Passaic County portion for Air Force gunner Clarence &quot;Red&quot; Mosely. The Somerset County portion is dedicatetd to Navy Captain Joseph Azzolina, and the Middlesex County portion for Lt. Col. Richard Lauer. The I-287/Harter Road interchange at exit 33 in Morris Township is named the Warren E. Wilhide Interchange in honor of a U.S. Army veteran who was based in Chunchon, Korea, and lived very close to the Harter Road exit.

<text>Jerry Sadowitz (born June 1961) is an American-born Scottish stand-up comedian and magician.

Notorious for his controversial brand of black comedy, Sadowitz has said that audiences going to see a comedian should suspend their beliefs. He has influenced a generation of comedians, but states that &quot;politically incorrect comedy: it&#x27;s me, and it&#x27;s been ripped off by loads and loads of comics&quot;. In 2007, he was voted the 15th-greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups&quot;. In the 2010 list, he was voted the 33rd-greatest stand-up comic.

Sadowitz is also widely acclaimed as one of the best close-up magicians in the world and an accomplished practitioner of sleight of hand, having written several books on magic and invented several conjuring innovations.

==Early life==
Sadowitz was born in June 1961 in New Jersey, the son of a Scottish-Jewish mother named Roslyn and a Jewish-American father who worked as a scrap metal merchant. His parents split up when he was three, and he moved with his mother back to her native Glasgow when he was seven. Sadowitz attended Calderwood Lodge Primary and then Shawlands Academy. He took an interest in magic at the age of nine, and by the age of 11 decided that he wanted to become a magician, acquiring books from Tam Shepherd&#x27;s Magic and Joke Shop. Sadowitz was encouraged by his mother to research magic at his local library, and he was once kicked out of a school exam after the examiner discovered his deck of cards and thought he was cheating. He has suffered from ulcerative colitis since childhood.

==Career==
===1980s===
Sadowitz made his comedy debut in 1983 at a Glasgow club and secured a regular stand-up slot at the Weavers Inn pub on London Road in Glasgow. The pub was run by future comedian Janey Godley, and Sadowitz got the gig after her brother Jim begged her to put him on. Sadowitz began travelling to London to perform at The Comedy Store every two weeks for two years, making the 400-mile journey via Stagecoach express coach. He moved to the city permanently in 1986, living with his mother in Hampstead until 2005. There, he began his first job working in Selfridges.

In the early days, Sadowitz was managed by comedian and club proprietor Malcolm Hardee. As a bet with fellow comic Nick Revell, he produced one of his most famous lines of that era: &quot;Nelson Mandela, what a cunt. Terry Waite, fucking bastard. I dunno, you lend some people a fiver, you never see them again.&quot; For a time Sadowitz was considered part of the alternative comedy movement, but his act proved too objectionable with &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating that Sadowitz &quot;shook up the right-on values of the 80s alternative comedy circuit with his willingness to say the unsayable&quot;. Sadowitz has described Bernard Manning as &quot;the good cop&quot; to his bad.

Sadowitz&#x27;s 1987 Edinburgh Fringe show &quot;Total Abuse&quot; was filmed at the Assembly Rooms and also released in audio as the album &quot;Gobshite&quot;. The album was quickly withdrawn from sale due to fears of being sued for libel by Jimmy Savile as Sadowitz references rumours of the TV personality being a paedophile. Following Savile&#x27;s death in 2011, hundreds of reports of sexual abuse by him became public.

After a brief run as a columnist for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, he embarked on the &quot;Lose Your Comic Virginity&quot; tour in 1989. At this time he was being managed by Jon Thoday&#x27;s fledgling Avalon Entertainment Ltd. The tour culminated in a show at the Dominion Theatre in London, at the end of which he appeared from the rear of the auditorium wearing a kilt and a huge plastic phallus from which he sprayed the audience.

===1990s===
In 1991, Sadowitz was knocked unconscious by an audience member during a performance at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, where he mocked French Canadians, starting with the greeting &quot;Hello moosefuckers! I tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them.&quot; The rarely quoted follow-up line, which Sadowitz claims is what actually led to him being attacked, was &quot;Why don&#x27;t you speak Indian? You might as well speak the language of the people you stole the country off of in the first place.&quot;

In 1992, Sadowitz appeared in his own television show &quot;The Pall Bearer&#x27;s Revue&quot;. In the same year, he appeared in the music video of The Shamen&#x27;s UK number 1 hit &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot;. Sadowitz later expressed regret over his appearance in the video, stating that &quot;it shows how stupid I am. I didn&#x27;t even know that song was about drugs. I don&#x27;t take drugs and had I known I wouldn&#x27;t have done it&quot;. He also befriended Derren Brown, who he met while working the International Magic shop in Clerkenwell, London. He helped Brown in his early career by putting him in touch with H&amp;R publishers and Objective Productions, a production company founded by the television magician Andrew O&#x27;Connor. which led to his breakthrough show &quot;Mind Control&quot; in 2000.

Between 1994 and 1998, Sadowitz performed as part of the double act &quot;Bib &amp; Bob&quot; with Logan Murray. His work with Murray took the form of sketches aimed at alienating almost everyone, with the duo stamping on a blow-up doll of the recently deceased Linda McCartney, and tipping Murray, dressed as Superman, out of a wheelchair into the audience (a reference to the paralysis of Christopher Reeve). At one show, Sadowitz spat in the face of a drunken heckler who was constantly interrupting the show. His final act was to strip naked and run across the stage, prompting a mixture of disgust and hilarity from the audience. The &quot;Herald&quot; described the show as featuring &quot;Pyrotechnical swearing. Lavatorial straining noises. Wanton foodstuff-smearing. Simulated sodomy. Gratuitous adoption of Indian accents, plus spitting, shouting, and penile dismemberment&quot;.

In 1998, Sadowitz joined the newly launched Channel 5 network, hosting his own panel show, &quot;The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz&quot;. The show featured Sadowitz sitting at a desk inviting members of the audience to join him and talk about a topic close to their heart and trying to get Sadowitz to agree with them. If they succeeded in winning Sadowitz over, they were invited back at the end of the show for a chance to compete for a £10,000 cash prize. If Sadowitz was not convinced or became bored during the audience member&#x27;s time, he would ring a bell on the desk signalling for the show&#x27;s resident bouncer Dave Courtney to escort them from the stage. Contestants on the show were regularly verbally abused by Sadowitz, and over the course of the series no one managed to win the cash prize. The show led to the channel being reprimanded by the Broadcasting Standards Commission, after they concluded that the repeated use of the words &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot; &quot;had a cumulative effect that was both excessive and unnecessary&quot;. In the same year, a full-frontal nude shot of Sadowitz appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine as part of a 14-page &quot;uncensored sex special&quot;. Despite the reprimand, Sadowitz continued to work with Channel 5, co-presenting &quot;The Jerry Atrick Show&quot; between 2000 and 2002.

===2000–present===

In 2005, Sadowitz performed two separate shows at that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Fringe: a stand-up comedy show (&quot;Not For The Easily Offended&quot;) at The Queens Hall, and &quot;Jerry Sadowitz – Card Tricks &amp; Close Up Magic&quot; at The Assembly Rooms. The comedy show included a character named &quot;Rabbi Burns&quot;, a cross between a Jew and the famous Scottish poet. He performed a similar series of shows at the Soho Theatre in London between December 2006 and January 2007.

In 2006 he toured his &quot;Equal Opportunities Offender&quot; show and broke the Soho box office record for ticket sales when he performed his close up magic show at the Soho Theatre. In 2007, he performed his Edinburgh Festival show &quot;Comedian, Magician, Psychopath&quot; to a sold-out crowd at the Udderbelly.

In March 2008, as part of the Glasgow Comedy Festival, Sadowitz sold out the Theatre Royal. He performed the show &quot;Comedian, Magician, Psychopath 2: Because I Still Have to Pay the Rent&quot; at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival in 2008. In this show he celebrated the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, making stereotypical references to Chinese people. In December 2008, Sadowitz sold out the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the Southbank, London.

In 2008, Sadowitz published an open letter to reviewers asking them not to quote his material stating that &quot;a very important element of comedy is surprise, and it can often make the difference between a show that works and one that does not&quot;. He also protects his intellectual property, removing clips of himself from YouTube and torrent sites within hours of their appearance.

Since 2010, Sadowitz has performed several runs at the Leicester Square Theatre in London. In April 2011, Sadowitz recorded two of these performances with the intention of releasing a DVD. The release was shelved after he changed his mind about releasing anything, stating that &quot;I don’t want people looking at me on a DVD for the first time – and there are loads of people who haven’t seen me – and thinking: &quot;Oh, he’s a bit like Frankie Boyle. Oh, he’s a bit like Ricky Gervais, he’s a bit like Jimmy Carr or Chubby Brown. I’ve heard Doug Stanhope do that...&quot; So I don&#x27;t want people saying that about me.&quot;

Sadowitz appeared in the 2012 Kathy Burke comedy-drama &quot;Walking and Talking&quot; on Sky Atlantic, playing the character Jimmy the Jew.

A stand up tour, &quot;Comedian, Magician, Bawbag!&quot;, in February 2013 and close up magic and comedy &quot;Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!&quot; in early 2014, when Sadowitz was promoted by an unknown friend, seemed to put Sadowitz back on the circuit with several sold-out shows including Manchester, Leeds, Brighton, Glasgow and Inverness. Throughout this tour, Sadowitz played a video appeal at the beginning performances regarding the death of his friend Mark Blanco, who died in December 2006 after falling from the first-floor balcony of a flat in Whitechapel belonging to singer Pete Doherty&#x27;s friend and literary agent Paul Roundhill. The video included an appeal from Blanco&#x27;s mother for the Crown Prosecution Service to reopen the case. 

In 2016, Sadowitz launched the &quot;Trick of the Month Club&quot; in which he teaches a new card trick every month to paying subscribers. In late 2016 Sadowitz tour &quot;Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!&quot; visited London, Glasgow, Manchester and Wolverhampton.

In 2019, Sadowitz toured the UK with his show &quot;Make Comedy Grate Again&quot; (a reference to Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;). A gig in Liverpool during this run of shows was covered on comedy website Chortle after an audience member collapsed due to excessive laughter. Sadowitz also took his &quot;Comedian, Magician, Psychopath 2019&quot; show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Sadowitz&#x27;s 2022 Edinburgh Fringe show was cancelled after one night because staff members—and, reportedly, audience members–at the Pleasance theatre found the material offensive. The venue later clarified that this was due to &quot;racism, sexism, homophobia and misogyny&quot;, that &quot;the material presented at his first show is not acceptable and does not align with our values&quot;, and that he had exposed his penis to a member of the audience. Sadowitz defended himself against those who made the decision, accusing them of &quot;cheapening and simplifying&quot; his act. In the aftermath of Sadowitz&#x27;s show at the Fringe being cancelled, his tour of the UK saw increased ticket sales and a date being added at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo.

==Comedy style==

Commenting on his &quot;imitators&quot;, he said that &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;ve given some very nasty people a good living.&quot;

Outbursts of his savage comedy during his conjuring shows have sometimes alienated him from the more conservative magic community.

<doc id="1002686" wikidata="Q7153455" url="?curid=1002686" title="Paul Schell">
<text>Paul Schell (born Paul Ervin Schlachtenhaufen; October 8, 1937 – July 27, 2014) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 50th mayor of Seattle, Washington, from 1998 to 2002.

==Early life and education==
The oldest of six children of Lutheran minister Ervin Schlachtenhaufen and nurse Gertrude Reiff Schlachtenhaufen, Paul Schell grew up in the small farm town of Pomeroy, Iowa, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa. He attended Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, where he played linebacker on the school football team. He also worked as a short-order cook and a fireman. Schell transferred to the University of Iowa where he completed his undergraduate degree. After graduation he went on to law school at Columbia University in New York. There he met his future wife, Pam, a registered nurse. They married on the day he graduated from law school — a double celebration scheduled so his father would have to pay for only one plane ticket.

==Career==

In New York, Schell took a position at the Dewey Ballantine law firm, where he specialized in corporate finance. During his time there, he shortened his surname &quot;Schlachtenhaufen&quot; to &quot;Schell,&quot; a change he described as &quot;practical, not political,&quot; since the longer name wouldn&#x27;t fit on computer punch cards used at the time. He worked as a summer law clerk in Portland. In 1967, Paul and Pam Schell moved to Seattle so he could take a job with the Perkins Coie law firm, practicing business and securities law. Their daughter Jamie joined the family in January 1971. After a few years with the Perkins firm, Schell left to help form a new law firm: Hillis, Schell, Phillips, Cairncross, Clark and Martin.

He joined other urban activists with Allied Arts of Seattle in the 1971 campaign to save the Pike Place Market from a proposed redevelopment. He left legal practice for civic affairs in 1973, when Mayor Wes Uhlman appointed him as director of the Seattle Department of Community Development. During his term with DCD, Schell oversaw the Market&#x27;s preservation and rebuilding. As President of Allied Arts of Seattle, he led the successful effort to establish &quot;One Percent for Art&quot; in 1973 — with Seattle becoming one of the first cities to adopt a program to fund public art, which has since become the national standard. A member of the Democratic Party, Schell first ran for mayor in 1977, but lost to Charles Royer.

In 1979, he founded Cornerstone Development Company, serving as president 1979-87. Among projects located in Seattle, Tacoma, and Portland, Cornerstone developed Waterfront Place, a 6-block mixed-use project located on Seattle&#x27;s central waterfront and incorporating six restored buildings, the new 22-story Watermark Tower, and the Alexis Hotel. In 1989, he developed the highly successful Inn at Langley, and later the Boatyard Inn, on Whidbey Island. He also played a key role in establishing the Whidbey Island Center for the Arts. 

In 1989, Schell won election as Commissioner for the Port of Seattle. He became commission president in 1995. He accepted appointment as Dean of the University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning, serving 1993-96. During that time he established the UW&#x27;s Office of Sustainability and enhanced the Rome Studies Program. He also supported the initiation of the Real Estate program and the Center for Environment, Education, and Design Studies. Schell succeeded in being elected to serve a four-year term as mayor commencing January 1, 1998. During Schell&#x27;s mayoral term, the City of Seattle built its new City Hall, the Seattle Justice Center, and several libraries, including the downtown library (via a $196 million Libraries for All bond campaign); invested $200 million in new parks and added six new community centers; rebuilt the Opera House and Seattle Symphony Hall, developed QWest Field, passed 26 new neighborhood plans, with resulting improvements via a $198 million levy for parks and the zoo. He also championed a $72 million effort that combined public and private dollars to renovate the Seattle Center Opera House and community centers, and initiated development of the Olympic Sculpture Park. In addition, he helped gain the transactions that resulted in Vulcan&#x27;s development of South Lake Union. Mayor Schell also participated in the design charrette for the new Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Traffic Control Tower, commissioned in 2004.

Also during his term the WTO Meeting of 1999 took place, accompanied by widespread violent protests that gained national attention. It caused the resignation of Seattle police chief Norm Stamper; Stamper said that was a previously planned retirement.
A particularly violent Mardi Gras celebration in 2001 left 20-year-old Kris Kime fatally injured; Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske ordered officers not to intervene. Arguably, the WTO meeting and the Mardi Gras violence played a role in Schell&#x27;s coming in a distant third behind two other Democrats in the 2001 mayoral primary election, as did Boeing&#x27;s relocation of its headquarters to Chicago.

It was the first time in over 65 years that an incumbent Seattle mayor had failed to survive a primary election. During the campaign, Schell was assaulted by a political opponent, a fringe mayoral candidate named James Garrett (a.k.a. Omari Tahir-Garrett). Garrett struck Schell in the face with a bullhorn he had been using to heckle the mayor, breaking bones under his right eye. Garrett was later convicted of second-degree assault and sentenced to 21 months in prison.

His mayoral predecessor Charles Royer assessed Schell&#x27;s term in a January 2002 interview in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;; &quot;Paul is smart. Maybe the smartest mayor we&#x27;ve ever had. ... [I]n his one term, Paul Schell got more done than any first-term mayor has a right to expect. The former developer not only got the new City Hall complex started, he led an impressive effort to build a new and important downtown library, rebuild the branches and renovate and build the community centers. He led the effort to fund a record $200 million in new parks, rebuilt the aging Opera House, and in a stunning victory that future generations will celebrate, preserved the 90,000 acres of the pristine Cedar River watershed.&quot;

==Death==
Schell died at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington following heart surgery on July 27, 2014, at the age of 76.

<text>Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), also known as hereditary multiple exostoses, is a disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign osteocartilaginous masses (exostoses) in relation to the ends of long bones of the lower limbs such as the femurs and tibias and of the upper limbs such as the humeri and forearm bones. They are also known as osteochondromas. Additional sites of occurrence include on flat bones such as the pelvic bone and scapula. The distribution and number of these exostoses show a wide diversity among affected individuals. Exostoses usually present during childhood. The vast majority of affected individuals become clinically manifest by the time they reach adolescence. The incidence of hereditary multiple exostoses is around 1 in 50,000 individuals. Hereditary multiple osteochondromas is the preferred term used by the World Health Organization. A small percentage of affected individuals are at risk for development of sarcomas as a result of malignant transformation. The risk that people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas have a 1 in 20 to 1 in 200 lifetime risk of developing sarcomas.

== Presentation ==
A noticeable lump in relation to an extremity may be the first presenting symptom. Multiple deformities can arise, namely coronal plane deformities around the knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. For example, genu valgum (knock knees), ankle valgus, ulnar bowing and shortening, and radial head subluxation are encountered. The majority of affected individuals have clinically manifest osteochondromas around the knee. Forearm involvement in HMO is considerable. Furthermore, short stature may occur and is generally disproportionate. Such manifestations usually result from disruption of physeal growth especially that osteochondromas typically arise at the metaphyseal ends of long bones in close proximity to the physis. Intra-articular osteochondromas of the hip can induce limitation of range of motion, joint pain and acetabular dysplasia. Likewise joint pain at other locations and neurovascular compression can occur. Furthermore, functional disability in regard to activities of daily living can be a presenting feature. Spinal deformity pain or neurological compromise should arouse suspicion of involvement of the vertebrae.

=== Pain ===
According to self-reports, a far majority of patients experience pain, and about half experience generalized pain. Individuals who had HME-related complications were five times more likely to have pain, while those who had surgery were 3.8 times more likely to have pain. No differences were found between males and females with respect to pain, surgery, or HME-related complications.

=== Possible Connection to Autism ===
Some parents of children with HME have observed autism-like social problems in their children. To explore those observations more deeply, a 2012 study by the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute used a mouse model of HME to observe cognitive function. The findings indicated that the mutant mice endorsed three autistic characteristics: social impairment, impairments in ultrasonic vocalization, and repetitive behavior.

=== Heparan Sulfate Connections ===
MHE stems from an inability to biosynthesize heparan sulfate, a proteoglycan. As Cueller et al. note: &quot;[E]ncoding glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquitously expressed heparan sulphate (HS) chains, are associated with MHE.&quot;

==Genetics==
HME is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. This means that a patient with HME has a 50% chance of transmitting this disorder to his or her children. Most individuals with HME have a parent who also has the condition, however, approximately 10% -20% of individuals with HME have the condition as a result of a spontaneous mutation and are thus the first person in their family to be affected.

HME has thus far been linked with mutations in three genes:
* EXT1 which maps to chromosome 8q24.1
* EXT2 which maps to 11p13
* EXT3 which maps to the short arm of Chromosome 19 (though its exact location has yet to be precisely determined)

Mutations in these genes typically lead to the synthesis of a truncated EXT protein which does not function normally. It is known that EXT proteins are important enzymes in the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans; however, the exact mechanism by which altered synthesis of heparan sulfate that could lead to the abnormal bone growth associated with HME is unclear. It is thought that normal chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation may be affected, leading to abnormal bone growth. Since the HME genes are involved in the synthesis of a glycan (heparan sulfate), HME may be considered a congenital disorder of glycosylation according to the new CDG nomenclature suggested in 2009.

For individuals with HME who are considering starting a family, preimplantation genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis are available to determine if their unborn child has inherited the disease. HME has a 96% penetrance, which means that if the affected gene is indeed transmitted to a child, the child will have a 96% of actually manifesting the disease, and 4% chance of having the disease but never manifesting it. The 96% penetrance figure comes from only one study. Other studies have observed both incomplete and variable penetrance but without calculating the % penetrance, e.g. In both the aforementioned studies the symptomless individuals carrying the faulty gene were predominantly female, leading to speculation that incomplete penetrance is more likely to be exhibited in females. Indeed, other work has shown that boys/men tend to have worse disease than females, as well as that the number of exostoses in affected members of the same family can vary greatly. It is also possible for females to be severely affected. Severity of symptoms varies between individuals, even in the same family.

Symptoms are more likely to be severe if the mutation is on the &quot;ext1&quot; gene rather than &quot;ext2&quot; or &quot;ext3&quot;; &quot;ext1&quot; is also the most commonly affected gene in patients of this disorder.

==Pathophysiology==
It is characterized by the growth of cartilage-capped benign bone tumours around areas of active bone growth, particularly the metaphysis of the long bones. Typically five or six exostoses are found in upper and lower limbs. Image depicts adult regrowth after knee replacement. 

Most common locations are:
* Distal femur (70%)
* Proximal tibia (70%)
* Humerus (50%)
* Proximal fibula (30%)

HME can lead to the shortening and bowing of bones; affected individuals often have a short stature. Depending on their location the exostoses can cause problems including: pain or numbness from nerve compression, vascular compromise, inequality of limb length, irritation of tendon and muscle, Madelung&#x27;s deformity as well as a limited range of motion at the joints upon which they encroach. A person with HME has an increased risk of developing a rare form of bone cancer called chondrosarcoma as an adult. Problems may be had in later life and these could include weak bones and nerve damage. The reported rate of transformation ranges from as low as 0.57% to as high as 8.3% of people with HME. Some authors have described an association between HME and the presence of popliteal pseudoaneurysms.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of HMO is based upon establishing an accurate correlation between the above-mentioned clinical features and the characteristic radiographic features. Family history can provide an important clue to the diagnosis. This is supplemented by testing for the two genes in which pathogenic variants are known to cause HMO namely EXT1 and EXT2. A combination of sequence analysis and deletion analysis of the entire coding regions of both EXT1 and EXT2 detects pathogenic variants in 70–95% of affected individuals. The hallmark of radiographic diagnosis is the presence of osteochondromas at the metaphyseal ends of long bones in which the cortex and medulla of the osteochondroma represent a continuous extension of the host bone. This is readily demonstrable in radiographs of the knees.

==Treatment==
The indications for surgical intervention in individuals with HMO vary across the medical literature. In general surgical treatment of HMO includes one or more of the following procedures: ostechondroma excision, gradual or acute bone lengthening such as the ulna lengthening, corrective osteotomies, temporary hemiepiphysiodesis to correct angular joint deformities such as distal radius hemiepiphysiodesis and medial distal tibial hemiepiphysiodesis. The success of surgery is not well-correlated with specific patient or disease characteristics, making it challenging to predict who will benefit most from intervention. Surgery may be most appropriate for patients with severe functional impairments, pain, or progressive deformities. To enhance the amount of evidence in the medical literature certain recommendations have been put forward. The construction of well-designed prospective studies that can provide a more clear relationship between surgical procedures, patient characteristics and outcomes is on high demand. Otherwise, following the current study designs will continue to raise more questions than answers. Total hip arthroplasty has been used to remedy severe and painful HMO of the hip joint. Total hip arthroplasty in individuals with HMO is challenging because of distortion of anatomy and repeated surgeries performed to address complaints related to exostosis.

==Epidemiology==
HME is estimated to occur in 1 in 50,000 people.

<doc id="1002690" wikidata="Q6609330" url="?curid=1002690" title="Changes in Star Wars re-releases">
<text>Many of the films in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise have been , both theatrically and on home media formats. Franchise creator George Lucas often altered the films for the . These alterations range from minor refinements (such as color grading and audio mixing) to major changes (such as the insertion of new dialogue, characters, and visual effects). The original trilogy was altered the most, although revisions were also made to the prequels. According to Lucas, some changes brought the films closer to his original vision, while others were attempts to create continuity with later films.

While different versions of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have existed since the 1977 release of the original film (later titled &quot;A New Hope&quot;), the first major changes were made in 1997 for the release of a Special Edition remaster in commemoration of the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. These changes were largely made as visual effects tests for the forthcoming prequel films, demonstrating the possibilities of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Additional notable changes were made when the original trilogy was released on DVD in 2004, in an attempt to create more consistency with the prequel trilogy. More changes were made to the films for their Blu-ray release in 2011 and for their 4K Ultra HD release in 2019.

Although some fans and critics felt that many of the smaller changes were innocuous or justified, most larger changes were received negatively—particularly those made to the original three films, the theatrical versions of which have never been officially released in high definition. Although the master negatives of the original trilogy were dismantled, another set of high-quality duplicates was created for long-term preservation.

==Background==
Prior to making &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Lucas experienced dissatisfaction with the changes made to his previous films by the studios that produced them. His first feature, &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), had five minutes removed by Warner Bros. His next film, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), had several minutes removed by Universal Pictures. Following the success of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Lucas&#x27;s original version of &quot;THX 1138&quot; was theatrically released in 1977. The original version of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was released theatrically in 1978, and was further altered for the 1998 DVD release with a CGI modification to the opening shot. In 2004, Lucas supervised a director&#x27;s cut of &quot;THX 1138&quot;, which included new special effects. As an advocate for the moral rights of artists, Lucas spoke before the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 in support of legislation that would discourage studios from altering films without the consent of the creators of those films. Lucas stated:People who alter or destroy works of art, and our cultural heritage, for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians ... Today, engineers with their computers can ... add or subtract material to the philosophical taste of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with &quot;fresher faces,&quot; or alter dialogue ... Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see ... the past generation as it saw itself, and how it worked with the mediums that were available to it.

==Release history==
* 1977: In May, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was theatrically released. Three different audio versions (a Dolby Stereo mix, a six-channel mix for 70 mm screenings, and a mono mix print) were created, with significant differences. Later that year, among others, a silent, English-subtitled Super 8 reel version of the film was released by Ken Films.
* 1980: In May, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was theatrically released. After its initial opening, but before its wide release, Lucas extended the end sequence. A 70 mm print of the film differed from the more widely distributed 35 mm print in takes of dialogue, visual and sound effects, shot choices, and transitions between shots; none of these changes appeared in later releases, with exception of one dialogue change.
* 1981: In April, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was re-released, with the addition of the subtitles &quot;&quot;Episode IV&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot;&quot; added to the opening crawl.
* 1983: In May, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was theatrically released.
* 1985: The original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film was re-released on VHS, LaserDisc, and Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) with an improved audio mix (featuring a fusion of Lucas&#x27;s preferred audio takes from the three 1977 mixes). The LaserDisc and CED sped the film up by 3% to fit onto a single disc.
* 1993: The original trilogy was released on LaserDisc as &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot;. With the exception of a new THX audio mix, scratch and dirt removal, and color balance changes, it matched the original theatrical releases.
* 1995: The original trilogy was re-released on VHS with THX audio, advertised as the final release of the theatrical versions.
* 1997: The &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the original trilogy was released theatrically from January through March for the 20th anniversary of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. This release featured the first significant changes, which were intended to prove that Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) could effectively produce CGI visual effects for the prequel trilogy.
* 1999: In May, &quot;Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was theatrically released.
* 2001: In November, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was released on DVD, which features a slightly extended cut from the theatrical release.
* 2002: In May, &quot;Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; was theatrically released. A version made for digital-projection theaters included a few special effects which were not ready for the initial wide release; the DVD features the digital version with some extended lines of dialogue. A version was also made for IMAX theaters using IMAX&#x27;s then-new digital-mastering process, with the aspect ratio cropped to 1.81:1 and the duration reduced to 120 minutes due to IMAX film platter limitations at the time.
* 2004: In September, the original trilogy was released on DVD. Further significant alterations were made, including replacing Latin script text with Aurebesh.
* 2005: In May, &quot;Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; was theatrically released. The DVD release features a minor editing change.
* 2006: In September, Limited Edition DVDs of the 2004 versions of the original trilogy were ; these contain the original unaltered versions on bonus discs. These match the 1993 LaserDisc release, sans the subtitle &quot;Episode IVA New Hope&quot;.
* 2011: The original and prequel trilogy were released on Blu-ray. Alterations were made to all six films.
* 2012: &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was theatrically re-released in 3D, with a minor change to one shot.
* 2015: The original and prequel films were released as a digital download. They are identical to their Blu-ray release, except for changes to the opening logos and fanfares. The U.S. Library of Congress made the original release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; available to watch in person. The sequel trilogy film &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; was theatrically released in both standard and IMAX formats.
* 2019: The original and prequel films were released in 4K resolution and HDR on Disney&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+. Color, compositing, and minor effects adjustments were made to all three films of the original trilogy.

== Significant changes ==
===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
====Title====
The franchise-originating film was released in 1977, under the title &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The subtitle &quot;Episode IVA New Hope&quot; was retroactively added to the opening crawl for the theatrical on April 10, 1981, to align with the titling of the sequel, &quot;Star Wars: Episode VThe Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980).

====Tatooine====
Aunt Beru&#x27;s dialogue was re-recorded with a different actress for the 1977 mono release, although the original actress was used for all later editions.

Some scenes on Tatooine were modified for the 1997 Special Edition, most notably an alteration to the Greedo scene and the restoration of a deleted scene featuring Jabba the Hutt. During the Empire&#x27;s search for the droids, two newly filmed shots of stormtroopers and CGI Dewback lizards were added. In another shot, a static Dewback was replaced with a moving CGI version. Writing in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Drew Stewart claimed the rationale for the added content was to illustrate the extent of the Empire&#x27;s search, but criticized the new shots as &quot;people wandering aimlessly.&quot; The sound Obi-Wan Kenobi makes to scare off the Tusken Raiders was changed for the 2004 DVD release, and then again for the 2011 Blu-ray release. In the scene in which R2-D2 hides in a cave, rocks were inserted in front of the cave for the Blu Ray release. Other alterations introduced in various releases include a CGI replacement of the Jawa sandcrawler, the replacement of an external shot of Obi-Wan&#x27;s hut with a new angle showing Luke Skywalker&#x27;s parked landspeeder, and color and continuity changes involving the binary sunset. The shadow of the landspeeder was redone in one shot, and creatures, robots, and ships were added to Mos Eisley, including elements created for the &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; multimedia campaign. Some of the aliens in the cantina were replaced with new CGI characters, and a shot of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; fighting its way out of Mos Eisley was added.

=====Greedo=====
Han Solo is cornered in the Mos Eisley cantina by the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo. When Greedo begins threatening him, Han kills him by shooting under the table. The 1997 release of the film alters the scene so that Greedo shoots first and misses (with Han&#x27;s head digitally pivoting away from the blaster bolt). The scene was changed again for the 2004 DVD release so that Han and Greedo shoot almost simultaneously; this was shortened by several frames for the 2011 Blu-ray release. The scene was further modified for the 2019 4K Ultra HD release with the addition of a close-up shot of Greedo speaking (without subtitles), as well as the removal of a reverse shot of Greedo, and a re-rendering of the visual effects.

The original version of the Greedo scene is considered iconic, while the altered version is one of the most controversial changes to the film by some. Some fans have coined the phrase &quot;Han shot first&quot; to protest the change, which according to &quot;Polygon&quot; alters Han&#x27;s moral ambiguity and his fundamental character. Lucas has stated that he always intended for Greedo to shoot first. In 2015, a copy of an early draft of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; screenplay was discovered in the archives of the University of New Brunswick library. In the script, dated March 15, 1976, only Han shoots. Greedo actor Paul Blake has also claimed that in the shooting script, Han fired the only shot. Lucas explained that he wanted Han to be a John Wayne-type character who allows his enemy to have the first shot before retaliating. He claims the original version of the scene portrayed Han as a &quot;cold-blooded killer&quot;. Writing in &quot;Wired&quot;, Matt Blum claimed that Han shot in self-defense, and that it is therefore inaccurate to call him a cold-blooded killer.

=====Jabba the Hutt=====
The original script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; included a scene with Han and Jabba in a Mos Eisley docking bay. The scene was filmed by a second unit with Declan Mulholland wearing a furry vest as a stand-in for Jabba. Lucas intended to replace Mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion character, but due to time limitations and budget constraints, the entire scene was cut. In the 1997 Special Edition, the scene was reinserted with a CGI Jabba replacing Mulholland. This was an early example of a fully CGI, speaking character in a film. The character preceded Jar Jar Binks in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; by two years, who was a combination of CGI and motion capture. To explain Jabba&#x27;s mobility despite his sluglike form, artist Claudia Mullaly conceived of repulsorlifts (one of which he sits upright in), but this concept was dropped.

In the original footage, Harrison Ford walked through the area where Jabba&#x27;s tail would be. As a workaround, Han was digitally moved to appear as if he steps on Jabba&#x27;s tail, with the Hutt squealing as a result. This part of the scene has been poorly received, including by its original animator Steve Williams. Boba Fett and several Rodians (at least one of whom is a look-alike of Greedo in the background) also appear in the scene, with Fett seeming to break the fourth wall.

The insertion of this scene was criticized for being superfluous and slowing down the pace of the narrative. Critics also claimed that it undermined the introduction of both the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; (in the following scene) and of Jabba (in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;). The 1997 CGI Jabba has been described as &quot;atrocious&quot;, and for the 2004 DVD release was replaced with a higher-fidelity version resembling the one in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. On the 2004 DVD audio commentary for &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Lucas said that while he did not mind cutting the scene when he was not sure if he could make sequels, he reintroduced it because Jabba is important to Han&#x27;s larger story arc. &quot;ScreenCrush&quot; later reflected that the 2004 version &quot;was an improvement, but only in the way that nausea is an improvement over vomit&quot;.

====Luke&#x27;s lightsaber====
During the training scene aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, Luke&#x27;s lightsaber—which in some releases had erroneously appeared green—was corrected to blue in the 2011 release.

====Death Star====
For the Special Edition, a scene of Han chasing a squad of stormtroopers on the Death Star was altered to replace several stormtroopers at the end of the corridor with dozens in formation. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; criticized the change as being &quot;too much&quot; and making Han&#x27;s shooting back at them less believable. Two &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writers call the updated version &quot;utterly ridiculous&quot; but &quot;much funnier&quot;. Another shot of a stormtrooper hitting his head on a door had a sound effect added in 2004, making it seem like the goof was intentional.

In the original version of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader&#x27;s duel, Obi-Wan&#x27;s saber appeared to &quot;short out&quot; when foreshortened toward the camera (a result of the in-camera effects failing to account for this viewing angle). A glow was added in 2004, and a fully finished blade was added to these shots in 2019. Also in the 2019 version, Obi-Wan&#x27;s lightsaber was adjusted to appear consistently blue, and the flash effects of the lightsabers clashing was redone.

Both the explosions of Alderaan and the Death Star had shockwaves added to them starting with the 1997 edition.

====Yavin 4====
The Special Edition of &quot;A New Hope&quot; incorporated a deleted scene on Yavin 4, in which Luke is briefly reunited with his childhood friend Biggs Darklighter. This was felt by some to strengthen the relationship of the characters during the climactic Death Star attack run. The scene also included the appearance of Red X-Wing Squadron Leader Garven Dreis, an addition that pleased his actor Drewe Henley although his credit remained not corrected.

The original film includes a two-shot sequence of X-wing fighters flying past Yavin towards the Death Star (showing the fighters from behind, then the front). For the 1997 edition, these were replaced with a 180° turn of CGI (seen from the front, then the back). &quot;Wired&quot; points out that the addition of the moon (Yavin 4) in the background places it &quot;very clearly in range of the Death Star from the very beginning of the battle.&quot; Additionally, engine sounds were added to the battle scene which make parts of the musical score difficult to hear.

===&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;===
According to Lucas, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; contains the most changes, although are mostly limited to compositing (e.g. during the Hoth battle), with only a few scenes being significantly altered. Christopher Miller, who later worked on &quot;&quot; (2018), claimed that he played a stormtrooper added to the film&#x27;s Special Edition while an intern at Lucasfilm.

====Hoth====
Close-up shots of the wampa that captures Luke on Hoth were inserted.

====The Emperor&#x27;s hologram====
For his appearance as a hologram in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, the Emperor was originally portrayed by masked actress Marjorie Eaton and voice actor Clive Revill. For the 2004 DVD edition and subsequent releases, this was replaced by new footage of Ian McDiarmid, who plays the character in later films. The dialogue was changed in the new version, making Vader seem to have been unaware of Luke&#x27;s paternity despite knowing his last name.

&quot;ScreenCrush&quot; argues that this change is the worst to any &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, owing to the altered dialogue. &quot;Wired&quot; writes that it is unclear whether the new dialogue is meant to portray Vader and the Emperor &quot;deliberately testing one another&quot;, and also that McDiarmid &quot;looks more like he did 20 years before in the timeline than he does a year later in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;&quot;. Sources such as &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;io9&quot; regard the actor replacement itself as logical, and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praises it as &quot;a change that blends seamlessly with the original film, due in large part to the relative ease of swapping one holographic image for another&quot;.

====Boba Fett====
Boba Fett&#x27;s dialogue in the film was originally recorded by Jason Wingreen. Subsequently, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; revealed Boba to be a clone of Jango Fett, played by Temuera Morrison. To reflect this, Morrison re-recorded Wingreen&#x27;s lines for the 2004 edition of the film.

In the shot when the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; detaches from the Star Destroyer, Boba Fett&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Slave I&quot;, was replaced with a CGI version following the &quot;Falcon&quot; more closely. Both &quot;WhatCulture&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot; opine that the change makes it hard to believe that Han could not see Fett.

====Cloud City====
New establishing shots were added to Cloud City, which according to Lucas were added partially because director Irvin Kershner was dissatisfied with the limitations of the location&#x27;s set. The additions create some inconsistencies with later shots. Another shot has a railing added to it, which does not reflect properly. New shots of Cloud City&#x27;s citizens reacting to Lando Calrissian&#x27;s evacuation orders were also added.

In the 1997 edition, the scene of Luke dropping down the chute to escape Vader was modified to include an audible scream—created using the sound of the Emperor screaming as he falls down the shaft in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;; this received criticism and was removed in later releases.

==== Ending ====
Following the initial limited theatrical release, Lucas added three exterior shots to the denouement to clarify that Lando and Chewbacca are on the &quot;Falcon,&quot; not the Rebel frigate that Luke, Leia, and the droids are on.

In the 1997 edition, a line of Vader&#x27;s dialogue was replaced and a shot of his shuttle landing in his Star Destroyer (using stock footage of the second Death Star from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in which Moff Jerjerrod appears) was inserted into the sequence in which Luke uses the Force to contact Leia. &quot;Wired&quot; calls this &quot;Yet another addition that answers a question no one had.&quot;

===&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;===
With the Blu-ray release, the Ewoks now blink. This detail was hoped for during the original production, but was abandoned due to practical limitations of the costumes.

====Jabba&#x27;s palace====
In the Special Edition, an establishing shot of a bantha herd was inserted, and a CGI beak and extra tentacles were added to the sarlacc. Jabba&#x27;s dialogue was given subtitles, although translates most of his lines. The 2011 edition extends the front door of Jabba&#x27;s palace as seen from the outside to make it appear about three times wider. The Blu-ray also added a Dug to the inside of the palace, which was criticized as standing out from puppet aliens in the same scene.
The scene in which Jabba feeds the dancer Oola to his rancor opens with a performance by the Max Rebo Band and its lead singer, Sy Snootles. In the original theatrical release, the song is &quot;Lapti Nek&quot;, sung in the fictional language Huttese. The Special Edition changed the performance to the new song &quot;Jedi Rocks&quot;, which mostly received negative criticism. &quot;Polygon&quot;″s Owen Good describes the new vocals as difficult to listen to and having &quot;the volume and vocal fry of a higher pitched Tina Turner but none of the soul&quot;. The puppet used for Snootles was also replaced with CGI. According to Special Edition producer Rick McCallum, this change was made because Lucas could not originally achieve the &quot;large musical number&quot; he envisioned because characters could not move in certain ways; Snootles could not open her mouth to lip sync correctly, and her eyes did not move. The Special Edition increased the size of the Max Rebo Band from three members to twelve. Additional footage was filmed of Boba Fett flirting with one of the dancers; original Fett actor Jeremy Bulloch thought this was somewhat contrary to the character&#x27;s nature.
In the theatrical release of the film, Oola&#x27;s death is filmed from outside the rancor pit: she falls into the pit, and her scream is heard from off-screen. In the 1997 edition, extra shots were inserted depicting her in the pit, including shots where she looks up to the crowd, the pit door being raised, and a shot of her terror. The rancor and Oola as she screams remain off-screen. Femi Taylor, who played Oola, impressed critics with her ability to reprise the role over a decade later without visible difference. &quot;Wired&quot; notes that &quot;they put a different eyeshadow color on her, so she&#x27;s not exactly seamless.&quot; James Whitbrook at &quot;io9&quot; praised the additions to the scene, writing that it teased the rancor well while still keeping the monster a surprise for Luke&#x27;s later battle with it. Conversely, &quot;Den of Geek UK&quot; criticized the additions as unnecessary and felt that they made the audience familiar with the pit, weakening Luke&#x27;s scene.

In 2004, Lucas revealed that he had considered adding a shot of Fett escaping the sarlacc, but decided against it because it would have detracted from the scene&#x27;s focus: Jabba&#x27;s death. Fett&#x27;s survival was eventually depicted in the Disney+ live-action streaming series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–present) and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2021–2022).

====Climax on the second Death Star====

At the climax of the film, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning, prompting Vader to throw the Emperor down a chasm. In the original version of the scene, Vader has no dialogue. Starting with the 2011 edition, Vader mutters &quot;No&quot; and then yells a drawn-out &quot;No!&quot;, creating a parallel with his near-identical cry at the end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. This addition was described as being unnecessary at best, and at worst being clumsy, sounding terrible, and seeming to mock the scene in the prequel. A &quot;Polygon&quot; writer argues that the change displays a distrust in the audience&#x27;s ability to interpret Vader&#x27;s emotions and further that it made the emotional scene &quot;laughable&quot;.
In the scene where Anakin Skywalker is unmasked, the 2004 edition digitally removed his eyebrows to reflect Anakin burning on Mustafar at the end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Actor Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s brown eyes were also digitally changed to blue to match Hayden Christensen&#x27;s eye color.

====Victory celebration====
The film ends with a scene of the Rebel Alliance and a village of Ewoks on Endor celebrating the death of the Emperor and victory over the Empire. The original theatrical release of the film features the song &quot;Ewok Celebration&quot;, also known as &quot;Yub Nub&quot;, playing over the celebration. The 1997 edition release of the film replaced &quot;Ewok Celebration&quot; with score composed by John Williams titled &quot;Victory Celebration&quot;, and the scene was lengthened to include shots of celebration on the planets Coruscant, Bespin, and Tatooine. The 2004 edition further added a shot set on Naboo, in which a Gungan is given a line of dialogue, and added the Senate building and Jedi Temple to Coruscant. The concept for the interplanetary montage was discussed during the film&#x27;s .

====Anakin&#x27;s Force spirit====
Near the end of the film, Vader kills the Emperor to save Luke&#x27;s life, then dies of his injuries. He later appears to Luke as the Force spirit of Anakin, alongside Yoda and Obi-Wan. In the original version, Sebastian Shaw plays the spirit, as well as the unmasked Vader. Because Hayden Christensen played Anakin in the prequel films &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the 2004 DVD edition of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; features Christensen as the spirit, replacing Shaw. In a 2005 conversation with Christensen, Lucas explained the change in this way: &quot;When you come back to the good side of the Force, it&#x27;s your former persona that survives, not the Darth Vader persona.&quot; The alteration was ranked as the worst change to the original trilogy by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;. &quot;The Digital Bits&quot; notes that the 2019 restoration made it more obvious where Anakin&#x27;s head was replaced.

===&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;===
The DVD released in 2001 features a longer version of the podrace sequence, as well as a brief scene on Coruscant focusing on Anakin and Jar Jar Binks. The 2011 Blu-ray incorporates a CGI Yoda. For the 2012 3D , the end of Anakin&#x27;s magnetic wand was redesigned in one shot of the podrace.

==== Podrace sequence ====
The extended podrace includes a longer introduction of the racers and the second lap of the race, which &quot;Screen Rant&quot; says does not contribute to the story, and potentially negatively affects the film&#x27;s pacing. Additionally, shots including Watto cheering for Anakin&#x27;s rival Sebulba were removed for home media releases.

====CGI Yoda====

In the original version of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, a puppet was used to portray Yoda except in two wide shots which required CGI. This was changed for the 2011 release, with the puppet being replaced with a CGI model, similar to those used for the film&#x27;s sequels, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

=== &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; ===
A few special effects which were not ready for the initial wide release were completed for release in digital-projection theaters. The DVD features the digital version with some extended lines of dialogue. The 2011 edition features a small editing change to the Coruscant speeder chase, adds a voiceover to Anakin&#x27;s vision of Shmi, and changes the order of shots depicting Count Dooku&#x27;s escape.

=== &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; ===
The theatrical release had a diagonal wipe from Obi-Wan leaving Mustafar to Anakin using his hand to crawl from the lava. The DVD changed this to a direct cut, which was reverted on the Blu-ray. The latter release also has additional clone trooper dialogue as they land on Utapau, and added moss to the treehouse on Kashyyyk. 

The filmmakers had discussions of what further changes could be done to past films or in revisions of this film; Lucas was impressed enough with the Creature Shop&#x27;s radio-controlled mask for the background character of Senator Meena Tills that he briefly considered replacing the footage containing Admiral Ackbar&#x27;s mask in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; with Meena&#x27;s one due to always feeling that Ackbar&#x27;s was compromised despite being done with the latest puppetry technology available back then, while McCallum expressed his hopes in the film&#x27;s audio commentary that, as part of a hypothetical six-episode DVD box set, Lucas would restore a deleted scene of Yoda arriving at Dagobah to begin his self-imposed exile, which was cut as Lucas felt the film would have had &quot;too many endings&quot;.

== Reception ==

Various media outlets have cited certain changes to the original trilogy as being particularly egregious. These include: in &quot;A New Hope&quot;, making Greedo shoot first (which has been especially criticized for playing tricks with viewers&#x27; minds and memories) and the restored Jabba scene; in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, changes to the Emperor&#x27;s dialogue (and appearance); in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the new song in Jabba&#x27;s palace, Vader yelling &quot;No!&quot; at the climax, and Christensen replacing Shaw as Anakin&#x27;s spirit.

In 2015, Lance Ulanoff of &quot;Mashable&quot; viewed the original theatrical print of &quot;Star Wars&quot; submitted to the Library of Congress, and noted merit to Lucas&#x27;s belief that technology did not allow him to achieve his vision, citing a visible marquee around Leia&#x27;s ship &quot;so jarring that it temporarily pulls me out of the film&quot; because the original print is &quot;lack[ing] the seamless quality [he has] come to expect from sci-fi and fantasy&quot;. Despite this, Ulanoff wrote that he &quot;hate[s] each and every one&quot; of the later added CGI effects. In 2017, a writer argued that the Special Edition changes to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;stripped the film of every aspect that it had won its Academy Awards for&quot;, including those for Best Visual Effects, Best Production Design, and Best Original Score.

A smaller number of changes have been cited as improving the films or not harming them. A 2015 &quot;Polygon&quot; article claimed there was &quot;solid logic&quot; behind a number of the minor changes, such as adding windows to Cloud City or sparks to Jango Fett&#x27;s jetpack, saying these &quot;angered, to a close approximation, nobody&quot;. &quot;A New Hope&quot;&#x27;s restored Biggs scene has garnered mostly favorable feedback. In 2021, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised special effects additions to &quot;A New Hope&quot;, including the CGI Dewback replacement, the Mos Eisley establishing shots, and the explosions of Alderaan and the Death Star. A consistent minority viewpoint has held that the net total of changes improves the films more than it detracts from them.

== Legacy ==

The master negatives of the original trilogy were reportedly dismantled in order to create the Special Editions, although high-quality duplicates known as separation masters exist (also used as a source for the 1997 versions). In 1997, Lucas stated, &quot;There will only be one [version of each film] ... The [original] will be some sort of interesting artifact ... [that] will disappear. ... A hundred years from now, the only version of the movie that anyone will remember will be the DVD version.&quot; Asked why he was opposed to releasing the original versions of the films alongside the modified versions, Lucas stated in 2004: &quot;To me, [the original movie] doesn&#x27;t really exist anymore. ... I&#x27;m sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.&quot; Lucas has said the Special Edition of a &quot;A New Hope&quot; brought the film from representing 60% of his vision to 80%.

Gary Kurtz, producer of &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, spoke against changing films retroactively in a 2002 interview. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m just not a great believer in messing with what is done. It may not be perfect, and as I said a long time ago, there&#x27;s nothing that is.&quot; Addressing the Special Editions, he said... fixing a few matte lines and adding a couple of spaceships into shots is fine. I don&#x27;t think anybody would notice that. But actually adding scenes that don&#x27;t make any difference ... and all of those digitally enhanced shots of robots floating around and creatures walking through the frame ... call attention to themselves. Are much worse, actually, I think. Primarily because CGI work ... done by ILM, which is the best there is ... does not fit in with the mechanical style of the original film.Lucas&#x27;s name is sometimes used as a shorthand verb for the act of retroactively altering a film. In early 2002, filmmaker (and friend of Lucas) Steven Spielberg &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; in a digitally altered 20th-anniversary Special Edition, which notably replaced guns carried by federal agents with walkie-talkies. This prompted the creators of &quot;South Park&quot; to parody both Spielberg and Lucas&#x27;s changes to their films in an episode of their show. In 2007, &quot;Family Guy&quot; lampooned Christensen&#x27;s appearance as a spirit, and in 2017 comedian Brian Posehn stated that the original trilogy &quot;already was special&quot;. Lucas&#x27;s changes have become a primary point of reference for retroactive changes to other films. By contrast, some media outlets positively reviewed the 2020 4K release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, which was remastered and adjusted for color consistency with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy, but not otherwise significantly altered.

A number of errors remain in the latest version of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. For instance, Sebulba is unrendered in a brief shot in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, which special-effects supervisor John Knoll called attention to in the film&#x27;s 2001 DVD commentary. Craig Elvy of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said, &quot;This highlights how George Lucas&#x27; motivations for tweaking the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies are more about improving and updating than removing imperfections&quot;.

In 2019, Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm since the 2012 acquisition of the company by Disney, stated that she would not make alterations to Lucas&#x27;s original trilogy, because &quot;those will always remain his.&quot; While promoting &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, director J. J. Abrams expressed his hopes that the original versions of the trilogy would be officially released, but said that the powers that be had told him &quot;that that&#x27;s not necessarily possible&quot;. On whether he thought the sequel trilogy should be altered at some point, Abrams stated, &quot;I respect anyone who feels like they want to go back and adjust and add; I get that. But I also feel like ... [when] you&#x27;re done with a thing, ... that&#x27;s what it is.&quot; Contrarily, some media outlets have called for the climax of &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; to be altered to show the Force ghosts of the Jedi who aid Rey. Fan pleas for a director&#x27;s cut of the film trended on social media following the release of &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;.

In 2023, when asked if he had the clout to influence Lucasfilm to release the original cuts of the original trilogy, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; creator Jon Favreau answered, &quot;Do you think anybody but ... the people who grew up with it ... would care?&quot; He went on to explain his view that &quot;younger people have a whole different perception of what &quot;Star Wars&quot; is.&quot;

At the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, Lucas again refused to allow the release of the original cuts, repeating his previous statements with, &quot;I&#x27;m a firm believer that the director or the writer or the filmmaker should have a right to have his movie be the way he wants it.&quot;

<text>The Nonintercourse Act (also known as the Indian Intercourse Act or the Indian Nonintercourse Act) is the collective name given to six statutes passed by the United States Congress in 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, 1802, and 1834 to set boundaries of American Indian reservations. The various acts were also intended to regulate commerce between White Americans and citizens of Indigenous nations. The most notable provisions of the act regulate the inalienability of aboriginal title in the United States, a continuing source of litigation for almost 200 years. The prohibition on purchases of Indian lands without the approval of the federal government has its origins in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783.

==Text of the land provision==
The first four acts expired after four years; the 1802 and 1834 acts had no expiration. The version of the act in force at the time of the illicit conveyance determines the law that applies. The courts have found few legal differences between the five versions of the act. For example, three dissenting justices in &quot;South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe&quot; (1986) noted that the 1793 Act expanded the scope of the 1790 Act by applying the prohibition not only to lands but &quot;claims&quot;.

The original act, passed on July 22, 1790, provides:

The 1793 act provides:

The 1796 act provides:

The 1799 act provides:

The 1802 act provides:

The 1834 act, currently codified at 25 U.S.C. § 177, provides:

==Legislative history==
One of the earliest interpretations of the Nonintercourse Act comes from a speech by President George Washington to the Seneca Nation of New York in 1790, after the passage of the act:
I am not uninformed that the six Nations have been led into some difficulties with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was established, when the separate States and individuals under their authority, undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands. But the case is now entirely altered. The general Government only has the power, to treat with the Indian Nations, and any treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding. Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State nor person can purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty held under the authority of the United States. The general government will never consent to your being defrauded. But it will protect you in all your just rights.

==Land claims litigation==

===History===
The first litigation of the Nonintercourse Act by an indigenous party to reach the Supreme Court was &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), which the Court dismissed on the technicality that the court lacked original jurisdiction, so the result was the Cherokee did not have a standing as a foreign nation, but the opinion did not rule on the merits, leaving the door open for a ruling on a resubmitted case. Former Attorney General William Wirt, the Cherokee&#x27;s lawyer, argued that the challenged Georgia statute was void, inter alia, &quot;[b]ecause it is repugnant to a law of the United States passed in 1803 entitled &#x27;an act to regulate trade and intercourse with Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers&#x27;.&quot; Wirt also argued that the state statute violated the Cherokee treaties and the Contract Clause and the dormant Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. A similar argument was made in the Bill filed by Wirt in the Supreme Court. William Wirt&#x27;s arguments may have had a telling effect, for in a subsequent action, &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832), the court reversed itself, holding that the Cherokee were a sovereign nation and thus the Supreme Court did have original jurisdiction.

After &quot;Cherokee Nation&quot;, the next such case to reach the Court was &quot;Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy&quot; (1896). The New York Court of Appeals had dismissed the claim based on an interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act and an invocation of the statute of limitations for the state enabling act which enabled the Seneca to sue in state court; the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal because of the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine. The Act remained essentially unlitigated by tribes until &quot;Federal Power Commission v. Tuscarora Indian Nation&quot; (1960), where the Tuscarora attempted to avoid the condemnation of their land by the construction of a federal dam. The court held the Act inapplicable, but noted:

This dicta inspired &quot;Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida Cnty.&quot; (1974) (&quot;&quot;Oneida I&quot;), where the Supreme Court held that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction for Indian land claims based upon aboriginal title and violations of the Nonintercourse Act. In &quot;Oneida Cnty. v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State&quot; (1984) (&quot;Oneida II&quot;&quot;), the Supreme Court held that tribes have a federal common law cause of action, not pre-empted by the Nonintercourse Act, for possessory land claims based upon aboriginal title; the court also rejected the following affirmative defenses: limitations, abatement, ratification, and nonjusticiability.

While &quot;Oneida II&quot; remains the only final judgement entered by a court in favor of a tribe bringing a Nonintercourse Act land claim, &quot;Oneida I&quot; inspired dozens of other land claims. After tribes won initial judgements in some of these claims, Congress reacted by extinguishing the claimed aboriginal title and compensating the tribal plaintiffs. These Indian Land Claims Settlements are collected in 25 U.S.C. tit. 19. For example, in &quot;Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton&quot; (1st Cir. 1975), after the First Circuit held that the federal government was obliged to bring a suit on the tribe&#x27;s behalf claiming 60% of Maine, Congress approved an $81.5 million settlement. In the case of the Narragansett land claim (D.R.I. 1976), Congress enacted a settlement after the court struck all the defendant&#x27;s affirmative defenses (laches, statute of limitations/adverse possession, estoppel by sale, operation of state law, and public policy) and denied the state&#x27;s motion to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity and nonjusticiability. Similarly, in &quot;Mohegan Tribe v. Connecticut&quot; (D. Conn. 1982), Congress approved the creation of the Mohegan Sun after the court struck the defendant&#x27;s affirmative defenses. With the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and Wampanoag, Congress enacted a settlement before the courts had a chance to enter any rulings.

===Elements===
As stated in &quot;Narragansett&quot;, there are four elements to a Nonintercourse Act claim.

More recently (2008), the Second Circuit has stated:

====Tribal status====
The &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot; and &quot;Narragansett&quot; cases, supra, are examples where the plaintiff has prevailed despite not being federally recognized tribes (the Passamaquoddy obtained federal recognition through the Maine Indian Claims Settlement; the Narragansett gained federal recognition in 1983, five years after the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act). Although federal tribal status is prima facie evidence of the first element, the Act also applies to unrecognized tribes.

If the tribe is unrecognized, the defendant may defeat the plaintiff&#x27;s prima facie case either by showing that the Indians did not constitute a &quot;tribe&quot; at the time of the conveyance, or at the time of the litigation; thus, the defendant may show that the plaintiff is not the successor in interest to the tribe whose lands were illegally alienated. The leading case where the defendants prevailed on this element is &quot;Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp.&quot; (1st Cir. 1979). Alternatively, the action may be stayed until the Bureau of Indian Affairs makes a tribal status determination (and eventually dismissed if the BIA concludes the plaintiffs are not the successors in interest). The Pueblo were initially interpreted not to be &quot;Indians&quot; for the purposes of the Nonintercourse Act; however, this holding was subsequently overruled.

The elements given above are for a tribe. The United States, acting in its capacity as a trustee, may bring, and has successfully brought, actions on behalf of a tribe. The federal government was vested with similar power to enforce the anti-alienation provisions of the Allotment Acts. Conversely, individual Indians have no standing under the Act. This is true even if individual plaintiffs attempt the certify a class of all tribal members; the tribe itself must sue.

====Covered land====
Unlike the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783, the Nonintercourse Act applies to land within the boundaries of a state, including the original thirteen. The First Circuit in &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot; and the Second Circuit in &quot;Mohegan Tribe&quot;, supra, held that the Nonintercourse Act applies to the entire United States, including the original thirteen. No defendant has yet persuaded a court otherwise.

However, the defendant will defeat this element if the challenged conveyance occurred before 1790. The Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 may cover conveyances between 1783 and 1790, but the only court to consider it held that the Confederation Congress had neither the power nor the intent to prohibit conveyances to states within their borders. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 may cover conveyances between 1763 and 1783; however, the only court to examine such a conveyance found that it satisfied the requirements of the Proclamation. For example, the conveyances at issue in &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; (1823) occurred on July 5, 1773 and October 18, 1775, but neither party to the suit was indigenous.

====Federal non-consent====
Through the policies of Indian removal in the East and Indian reservation-creation in the West, the federal government removed Native Americans from most of their ancestral land. However, examples of Congress approving a state action that alienated land are rare indeed. Congress would have to pass a statute with express language, or the Senate would have to ratify the treaty alienating the land, to secure such federal approval. The view taken by several of the Indian Land Claims Settlements is that Congress may consent to such conveyances retroactively; this view has not been tested in court, although it is likely to be upheld because the power of Congress to extinguish aboriginal title without compensation is plenary.

====Trust relationship====
In &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot;, supra, the First Circuit held that only Congress, and only with a clear statement, can terminate a federal–tribal trust relationship; acts of state governments are irrelevant. Congress has done so with several tribes under Indian termination policy. Since &quot;South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe&quot; (1986) it has been understood that the Nonintercourse Act does not protect the lands of terminated tribes; there, the termination act was held to have triggered the state statute of limitations with respect to the land claim.

===Affirmative defenses===
Courts have considered and rejected several affirmative defenses to Nonintercourse Act suits. However, there are two affirmative defenses that have been accepted by some courts: state sovereign immunity and the equitable doctrine of laches.

====State sovereign immunity====

The structure of the original Constitution and the text of the Eleventh Amendment gives states sovereign immunity from most suits. There are exceptions: when the state consents to suit; when the federal government abrogates sovereign immunity by statute; when the federal government is the plaintiff or plaintiff-intervenor; and the category authorized by &quot;Ex parte Young&quot; (1908). In several cases, Nonintercourse Act plaintiffs have satisfied one of these exceptions. However, the Nonintercourse Act itself does not abrogate state sovereign immunity. Moreover, the authority is clear that the &quot;Ex parte Young&quot; exception does not apply. Therefore, plaintiffs must obtain the intervention of the federal government or relegate themselves to suing local governments and private land owners.

Further, in actions against states, Indians are not entitled to the presumption of 25 U.S.C. § 194, which applies only to &quot;persons&quot;.

====Laches====

Four dissenting justices would have barred the tribes action based on &quot;laches&quot; in &quot;Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State&quot; (1985), a question the majority did not reach. The Second Circuit adopted the view of the dissent in &quot;Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Pataki&quot; (2d Cir. 2005), and since then no tribal plaintiff has been able to overcome this affirmative defense in that circuit. &quot;Cayuga&quot; erased a damage award of $247.9 million, the largest ever awarded under the Act.

==Other provisions==

===Definition of Indian country===
In addition to regulating relations between Indians living on Indian land and non-Indians, the 1834 Act identified an area known as &quot;Indian country&quot;. This land was described as being &quot;all that part of the United States west of the Mississippi and not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana, or the territory of Arkansas&quot;. This is the land that became known as Indian Territory.

===Trading posts===
One of the most defining aspects of the acts was the establishment of a series of &quot;factories&quot; which were officially licensed trading posts where Native Americans were to sell their merchandise (particularly furs). The factories, which officially were set up to protect the tribes from unscrupulous private traders, were to be used as leverage to cause the tribes to cede substantial territory in exchange for access to the &quot;factory&quot; as happened with the Treaty of Fort Clark in which the Osage Nation exchanged most of Missouri in order to access Fort Clark.

===Property claims===
According to U.S. Attorney General William Wirt:

==State nonintercourse acts==

The Nonintercourse Act did not pre-empt the states from legislating additional restraints on alienation of Native American lands. Many states, including nearly all of the original Thirteen, enacted similar statutes for at least some lands during at least some time periods.

Other state statutes, or constitutional provisions, incorporated the English common law as it had evolved up to that point.

===New York===
A New York State enacted March 31, 1821, provided:

===South Carolina===
A 1739 South Carolina Provincial Council statute required a license from the Crown or governor for a private party to purchase lands from Indians.

<text>Boardwalk Records is a record label founded by Neil Bogart in 1980, after PolyGram acquired Casablanca Records from him.

==History==
The label had hit acts with Joan Jett and Harry Chapin. Other artists on the Boardwalk label included, Invisible Mans Band, produced by Alex Masucci and Clarence Burke Jr. Night Ranger, Ringo Starr, Curtis Mayfield, Ohio Players, Richard &quot;Dimples&quot; Fields, Chris Christian, Starpoint, Sunrize, Mike Love, Get Wet, Phil Seymour, Tierra and Carole Bayer Sager. Boardwalk Records also released the soundtracks for the 1980 film version of &quot;Popeye&quot;, which starred Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall, and for the 1982 film &quot;Megaforce&quot;.

Throughout its existence, Bellaphon Records served as Boardwalk&#x27;s distributor in Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Austria.

Chris Christian was the first artist signed to Boardwalk. In late 1981, &quot;I Want You I Need You&quot; became a #37 Top 40 &quot;Billboard&quot; pop hit and Top 10 A/C hit for Christian. Robert Kardashian, Kim Kardashian&#x27;s father, was Christian&#x27;s manager and was responsible for signing Christian to Boardwalk. Kardashian bought Christian&#x27;s album from the estate, and it is currently owned by YMC Records.

Bogart died of cancer in mid 1982 and the label closed down a year later. The Boardwalk catalog was purchased by Tom Ficara from W. Jersey Bank, which held the mortgage to the titles prior to the Boardwalk bankruptcy.

Boardwalk Records was relaunched as part of The Boardwalk Entertainment Group in 2010 by Neil Bogart&#x27;s sons, Evan Kidd Bogart and Timothy Bogart, and their partner, Gary A. Randall. Boardwalk&#x27;s current roster includes ZZ Ward, Wallpaper., and Nova Rockafeller In October 2019, Boardwalk sold the Ricky Reed catalogue to Anthem Entertainment.

<doc id="1002705" wikidata="Q6525125" url="?curid=1002705" title="Leonard Birchall">
<text>Air Commodore Leonard Joseph Birchall, (6 July 1915 – 10 September 2004), &quot;The Saviour of Ceylon&quot;, was a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) officer who warned of a Japanese attack on the island of Ceylon during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Birchall was born in St. Catharines, Ontario and graduated from St. Catharines Collegiate. He was always interested in flying, and worked odd jobs around St. Catharines to pay for flying lessons.

==Military service==
After serving in the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals, Birchall enrolled as a cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario (student #2364) in 1933. He was commissioned in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) upon graduation in 1937 and was trained as a pilot.

===Second World War===

At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Flying Officer Birchall flew convoy and anti-submarine patrols from Nova Scotia flying with No. 5 Squadron RCAF. The squadron was equipped with the Supermarine Stranraer.

On June 10, 1940, Birchall was responsible for the capture of an Italian merchant ship, the &quot;Capo Nola&quot;, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, hours after Canada declared war on Italy. Birchall had been tasked with locating any Italian vessels still in Canadian waters as the outbreak of war became imminent. On June 10, he found the &quot;Capo Nola&quot;. Birchall had been informed of the declaration of war by radio so made a low pass over the freighter, as if making an attack. This panicked the captain into running his vessel aground against a sandbank. Birchall then touched down nearby and waited until Royal Canadian Navy vessels reached the scene. The &quot;Capo Nola&#x27;s&quot; crew were the first Italian prisoners taken by the Allies during the war.

In early 1942, he joined No. 413 Squadron RCAF, then based in the Shetland Islands and flew patrols over the North Sea. After the Japanese successes in southeast Asia, the squadron was sent to Ceylon to provide a reconnaissance force.

On 4 April 1942, only two days after his arrival, Squadron Leader Birchall was flying a PBY Catalina flying boat (AJ155/QL-A) that was patrolling the ocean to the south of Ceylon. Nine hours into the mission, as the plane was about to return to base, ships were spotted on the horizon. Investigation revealed a large Japanese fleet, the Nagumo Task Force (Responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor), including five aircraft carriers, heading for Ceylon, which at that time was the base for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Eastern Fleet. Birchall&#x27;s crew managed to send out a radio message, but the Catalina was soon shot down by six A6M2 Zero fighters from the carrier . 

The Japanese continued to strafe the wreck seriously wounding Sergeant John Henzell in the front turret. He was lost when the aircraft sank along with Warrant Officer Lucien &quot;Louis&quot; Colarossi. The Japanese continued their attack on those survivors in the water killing Sgt. Davidson. The remaining six crew members were eventually picked up by the Japanese destroyer Isokaze.

The Easter Sunday Raid went ahead despite Birchall&#x27;s signal, but his warning put the defenders on alert and allowed the harbour to be partially cleared before the Japanese attacked Colombo.

===Prisoner of war===
Three of his crewmen were killed in the action and the others, including Birchall, spent the rest of the war as prisoners of war (POWs). For many captured servicemen, a trip to a Japanese camp meant death.

As the senior Allied officer in four successive Japanese prisoner of war camps, the resistance led by Birchall helped to reduce the Allied death rate from an average of 30% to less than 2%. During his time in the POW camps, he repeatedly stood up to the Japanese and demanded fair treatment of the prisoners, in compliance with the Geneva Convention. In his first camp, he struck a Japanese soldier who was forcing a wounded Australian to work. This earned Birchall a severe beating and solitary confinement, but won him the respect of the other POWs. In 1944, Birchall encountered a situation in which sick men were being forced to work on the docks. He ordered all of the men to stop working until the sick were excused. Birchall was beaten and sent to a special discipline camp, where he again was beaten. He saved many ill soldiers by taking their beatings.

Birchall was liberated on 27 August 1945 by American troops. His wife Dorothy had not known whether he was dead or alive for two years. His diaries, written during his captivity and buried, formed the basis of a number of Allied wartime trials at which Birchall testified.

==Postwar==
In the immediate postwar years, Birchall served on the Canadian attaché staff in Washington, D.C., then was a member of the Canadian NATO delegation in Paris. He later commanded a fighter base and was commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada from 1963 until his retirement from the Canadian Forces in 1967. He retired from the RCAF rather than be associated with the unification of the Armed Forces. He later served as honorary colonel of 400 Tactical Helicopter and Training Squadron in the Air Reserve and No. 413 Squadron Regular Forces.

From 1967 to 1982 Birchall was chief executive and administrative officer of the Faculty of Administrative Studies at York University, which awarded him the degree of Doctor of Laws &quot;honoris causa&quot; on the occasion of his retirement in 1982.

In the 1994 general election in Sri Lanka, Birchall was an official observer.

Birchall died in Kingston, Ontario at the age of 89.

==Honours==

Birchall was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946, after his return to Canada for his work at prisoner of war camps. The citation, in part, read: &quot;he continually displayed the utmost concern for the welfare of fellow prisoners with complete disregard for his own safety. His consistent gallantry and glowing devotion to his men were in keeping with the finest traditions of the service&quot;. Birchall was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his part in detecting the attack on Ceylon and for alerting the Allies during that 1942 flight. The presentation was made on 29 April 1946 at the Embassy of Ceylon in Washington, D.C., United States. Hume Wrong, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, presented the OBE and the DFC to Birchall, in the presence of the Ambassador of Ceylon, Sir Claude Corea.

When citizens of his hometown, St. Catharines, Ontario, heard Birchall was missing in action, students of Connaught school planted a memorial tree. The Len Birchall Memorial Circle is also in St. Catharines.

In 1950, U.S. President Harry Truman appointed Birchall an Officer of the Legion of Merit, saying: &quot;His exploits became legendary throughout Japan and brought renewed faith and strength to many hundreds of ill and disheartened prisoners.&quot;

In 2000, Birchall was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada. In 2001, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame. He was honorary colonel at the Royal Military College of Canada. Birchall was the only member of the Canadian military to have earned five clasps for his Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration (CD), representing 62 years of service with the air force. The only other person with five clasps was Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

As a recipient of the 2001 Vimy Award, Birchall was recognized as a Canadian who made a significant and outstanding contribution to the defence and security of Canada and the preservation of Canada&#x27;s democratic values. He was also honoured for his years of service to the community, including building a facility in 1993 at a Kingston Girl Guide camp at his own cost.

The Leonard Birchall Sports pavilion at the Royal Military College of Canada, in the area of the Navy Bay sports fields, was constructed in his honour, from December 2008 to September 2009. The road leading to the terminal and hangars at Kingston&#x27;s Norman Rogers Airport is named Len Birchall Way.

Birchall was honoured in 2009 as one of the 100 most influential Canadians in aviation and had his name emblazoned directly behind the starboard roundel on the fuselage with the others on the 2009 CF-18 Centennial of Flight demonstration Hornet.

His widow Kathleen Birchall donated money to the Air Cadet League of Canada to set up a scholarship in his name. On 9 November 2011, 883 Air Commodore Leonard Birchall Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets based in Markham, Ontario was formed.

In 2011, Air Commodore Birchall&#x27;s name was also added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada.

Birchall was dubbed the &quot;Saviour of Ceylon&quot; by the Canadian press and not, as claimed by many, by Winston Churchill.

<doc id="1002711" wikidata="Q213214" url="?curid=1002711" title="Isthmus of Perekop">
<text>The Isthmus of Perekop, literally Isthmus of the Trench (; transliteration: &quot;Perekops&#x27;kyi pereshyiok&quot;; ; transliteration: &quot;Perekopskiy peresheek,&quot; , ; ; transliteration: &quot;Taphros&quot;), is the narrow, wide strip of land that connects the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland of Ukraine. The isthmus projects between the Black Sea to the west and the Syvash to the east. The isthmus takes its name of &quot;Perekop&quot; from the Tatar fortress of Or Qapi.

The border between Ukraine&#x27;s Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Kherson Oblast runs through the northern part of the isthmus. Since the start of the Russian military occupation and subsequent annexation of Crimea in 2014, this is also the de facto northern border of the Russian Republic of Crimea. The cities of Perekop, Armiansk, and Krasnoperekopsk are situated on the isthmus. The North Crimean Canal ran through the isthmus, supplying Crimea with fresh water from the Dnieper River. Ukraine closed the canal in 2014, and the water supply was only partially replaced by other local and Russian sources.

Rich salt ores are located in the south of the isthmus and are of commercial importance to the region.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Taphros&quot; in Greek means a dug-out trench, per a defensive trench dug between the Azov Sea and the Black Sea; there also appears to have been a town in the vicinity of the same name. The Crimean Tatar name of &quot;Or Qapı&quot; adopts the Greek in the Crimean Tatar language meaning &quot;Or&quot; &quot;trench&quot; and &quot;Qapı&quot; &quot;gate,&quot; and &quot;Perekop&quot; in the Slavic languages literally means a dug-out.

==History==
The strategic and commercial value of this area, together with the strategic value of being the gateway to Crimea, has made the isthmus the location of some particularly fierce battles. From antiquity through the Byzantine era the Greeks fortified the area, and so subsequently did the Crimean Tatars. In the 15th century the area became a colony of the maritime Republic of Genoa. In 1783 the area became a part of the Russian Empire, which made Perekop a county center of Tavriia gubernia. In 1954, together with Crimea it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic.

In November 1920, during the Russian Civil War, a battle was fought here between Red Army and the White troops of Pyotr Wrangel, who was in control of the Crimea. The Red Army turned out victorious, but 140,000 civilians fled over the Black Sea to Istanbul.
During World War II, the combined forces of German and Romanian troops under the command of Erich von Manstein entered Crimea through the Isthmus of Perekop. The battle of the isthmus lasted five days from 24 September 1941 before the isthmus was secured by the Axis forces. On 27 October the Axis forces advanced further into Crimea, leading to the Battle of Sevastopol, which ended with the capture of all of Crimea in July 1942. On 9 May 1944, the Red Army regained control of Crimea.

On 2 March 2014, it was reported that Russian troops were digging trenches along the border between Crimea and mainland Ukraine, which runs across the isthmus. Soon after, this became a de facto border between Russian-controlled Crimea and the rest of Ukraine until 24 February 2022, when Russian forces crossed over the frontier during their invasion of Ukraine and unilaterally annexed the adjacent areas of the Ukrainian mainland.

<text>Visions of Order (1964) is a posthumously-published work by conservative scholar Richard M. Weaver which argues that Western culture is in decline because many of its intellectuals refuse to believe in an underlying order of things—in the way things are, irrespective of beliefs about them.

More specific targets of Weaver&#x27;s wrath in this book include: the theory of biological evolution, public education, total wars, the immanentizing of social ideals, and an over-emphasis on function over status.</text><links>

<text>3×3 Eyes is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yuzo Takada. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazines &quot;Young Magazine Kaizokuban&quot; and &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot; from 1987 to 2002, spanning to a total of 40 volumes. The English language translation was published by Dark Horse Comics, but was discontinued after eight volumes in 2004.

Two original video animation (OVA) adaptations were released in 1991 and 1995. The first consists of four episodes averaging to half-hour of runtime and the second consists of three averaging out to 45 minutes of runtime. In the United States, the first OVA was first distributed by Streamline Pictures and the second was partially distributed by Orion Home Video shortly after the Japanese releases. Both OVAs were released in their entirety by Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom. The two OVAs were re-released in the United States by Pioneer Entertainment in 2001. There are also several &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; companion books, drama CDs, and video games, only released in Japan.

In 1993, &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; won the Kodansha Manga Award for the  category.

==Plot==
&quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; follows the adventures of Pai, the last remaining , and her new &quot;Wu&quot; (Chinese reading of 无; an immortal companion), Yakumo, as they desperately try to find a magical artifact, the Ningen no Zō, to make Pai human so that she can forget her troubled past. Pai travelled to Tokyo searching for the artifact, but shortly after she arrived, a thief snatched her backpack and cane from her. A teenage lad, Yakumo, tackled the crook and managed to get the pack back for her, though the thief escaped with the cane. Yakumo took her to his work, where Pai was able to get cleaned up, and where she discovered that he was the son of Professor Fujii, an archaeologist she had met in Tibet four years prior. The Professor had been researching the legends of the Sanjiyans and had befriended her and offered to help her find the Ningen, only to fall ill and die. Pai had his last letter to his son in her backpack, which asked Yakumo to help Pai with her quest. Although he did not believe his father&#x27;s tales of Pai being a monster, he agreed to assist her.

Their discussion was interrupted by news reports of a giant monster flying over the city. Pai recognised the creature as her pet Takuhi, who must have been released from his home in Pai&#x27;s cane by the thief, and who was now looking for her. Pai set out to retrieve him, with Yakumo close behind. However, when Yakumo saw Takuhi fly towards Pai, the lad mistook the beast&#x27;s welcome for an attack, and shoved Pai out the way; immediately Takuhi ripped into the
lad, fatally wounding him. Unwilling to lose the boy she had been hunting for and just located, Pai&#x27;s third eye opened, and she absorbed his soul. This restored his body, but tied him to her as her undead servant. Linked to her, he can only become human again when she becomes human. In the way of this goal are hordes of monsters and demons from the Shadow World, some desiring Pai&#x27;s powers, others who seek the Ningen for their own. Yakumo can again become mortal and end his constant need to protect Pai because if Pai dies, then so will he. Along the way, they encounter many followers of the now-dead demon god Kaiyanwang, all of whom wish to kill Pai or siphon off her power in order to resurrect their deity and/or gain immortality.

Two original video animations (OVAs) series were produced by Toei Animation and its subsidiary Studio Junio. The first, also entitled &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot;, was released as four episodes between July 25, 1991, and May 19, 1992. Three of the episodes were directed by Daisuke Nishio and one was directed by Kazuhisa Takenōchi. The second, , was directed by Takenōchi and released as three episodes between July 25, 1995, to June 25, 1996. Both starred Megumi Hayashibara as Pai and Kōji Tsujitani as Yakumo.

The first OVA was distributed in the United States by Streamline Pictures, which produced an English dub starring Eddie Frierson as Yakumo and Rebecca Forstadt as Pai. The episodes were first released individually on four VHS tapes from November 1, 1992, to June 6, 1993, and later combined by Orion Home Video on a single volume entitled &quot;3×3 Perfect Collection&quot;, released on LaserDisc on August 24, 1994, and VHS on February 21, 1995. An English dub of the second OVA was produced by Pretend Productions, with Frierson and Forstadt reprising their roles, after Orion declined Streamline&#x27;s plans to produce a release. Orion distributed the first two episodes of the second OVA on individual VHS tapes, but did not release the final episode due to its 1997 bankruptcy. The six episodes distributed by Streamline and Orion were briefly re-released by MGM until April 1999.

In the United Kingdom, Manga Entertainment distributed both OVAs on five VHS tapes from April 5, 1993, to October 14, 1996. Manga&#x27;s release used the Streamline/Orion dub and included the final episode that was unreleased in the United States. The four episodes of the first OVA were combined into two parts on two VHS tapes and later a single VHS; the episodes of the second OVA were released individually as the third, fourth, and fifth parts.

The two OVAs were re-released in the United States by Pioneer/Geneon Entertainment with a new English dub produced by New Generation Pictures that starred Christian Campbell as Yakumo and Brigitte Bako as Pai. Directed by Greg Weisman, the dub also featured Keith David, Bill Fagerbakke, Thom Adcox-Hernandez, and Ed Asner, who appeared with Bako in Weisman&#x27;s series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. Pioneer/Geneon first released the episodes on two two-set VHS tapes and a two-disc DVD set in 2000 and later on two DVDs for each OVA in 2007. Since Geneon&#x27;s 2007 bankruptcy, the OVAs have been out of print in the United States.

As of February 2015, &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; had over 33 million copies in circulation. In 1993, the manga won the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen.

The OVA adaptation had received mixed reviews. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised both OVAs stating &quot;While not a spectacular series, &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; is nonetheless a very solid production which should entertain those who don&#x27;t mind high levels of bloodshed and rampant mystical content.&quot; Justin Sevakis also of Anime News Network, criticized the artstyle the animation quality of the series, whilst noting that the series is still entertaining. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews praised the first OVA for its animation and characters, but criticized the story for its &quot;disjunctive nature&quot; and &quot;anticlimactic&quot; ending. For the second OVA, Ross gave the plot a mix review noting that it is more coherent than the previous OVA, but also more confusing. Stig Høgset also of THEM Anime Reviews, gave both the OVAs a more positive review, praising the characters and artwork, but criticizing the ending for it feeling unfinished. Luis Cruz from Mania gave the first OVA a mixed review, stating, &quot;&quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; has the material to be a classic series However, the OVA format limits its potential by constraining the amount of time it can spend building the characters and their world.&quot; He continued to state for the second OVA, &quot;It only falls short by being hobbled with a story arc conclusion rather than a proper ending&quot; and &quot;the story stands well enough on its own and provides nearly two hours of action, humor, and intriguing mysteries&quot;.

<doc id="1002717" wikidata="Q1306758" url="?curid=1002717" title="Foul Play (1978 film)">
<text>Foul Play is a 1978 American romantic neo-noir comedy thriller film written and directed by Colin Higgins, and starring Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase, Dudley Moore, Burgess Meredith, Eugene Roche, Rachel Roberts, Brian Dennehy and Billy Barty. In it, a recently divorced librarian is drawn into a mystery when a stranger hides a roll of film in a pack of cigarettes and gives it to her for safekeeping.

The film received seven Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Hawn), Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Chase) and Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Moore), as well as for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but won none.

The film inspired a television series of the same name starring Barry Bostwick and Deborah Raffin that aired on the ABC network in early 1981, and was cancelled after six episodes.

==Plot==
A Catholic archbishop returns home, walks into a room and puts on a record. He opens his cupboard and sees the reflection of a similar looking man staring back at him. He turns around quickly and is killed by a knife thrown into his chest.

While attending a party overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, recent San Francisco divorcée and shy librarian Gloria Mundy sees Lieutenant Tony Carlson, a young police officer, at the bar, who ruins the moment by stumbling and spilling all the drinks. Gloria sits with a friend and is encouraged to open herself to new experiences. Driving home, Gloria picks up an attractive man named Bob &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott when she encounters him next to his broken down car. She impulsively accepts Scotty&#x27;s invitation to join him at the Nuart Theatre that evening, and before they part ways, he asks her to take his pack of cigarettes to help him curb his smoking. Unknown to her, Scotty has secreted a roll of undeveloped film in the cigarette pack. That evening, a seriously wounded Scotty meets Gloria in the theater and asks her about the film. He bleeds into her popcorn and warns her to &quot;beware of the dwarf&quot; before he dies. When his body mysteriously disappears while Gloria seeks help from the theater manager, she is unable to convince anyone of what has transpired. At home, she tells her elderly neighbor and landlord Mr. Hennessey of the events.

At the end of the next day, Gloria is attacked in her library by albino Whitey Jackson who tries to use ether on her. She runs off and hides in a singles bar where she asks a stranger, Stanley Tibbets, to take her home, but Stanley, an aspiring British womanizer who assumes she wants to have sex, mixes a cocktail laced with Spanish Fly and dances while removing nearly all his clothing to a Bee Gees album. Shocked by his misunderstanding, Gloria flees and returns to her apartment, where she is attacked by a man with a scar who demands the cigarette pack Scotty had given her. When he attempts to strangle her with a scarf, Gloria stabs him in the stomach with a pair of knitting needles and calls the police. When the attacker tries to stop her, he is killed by a knife thrown by Whitey through the kitchen window, and Gloria faints in shock. When she awakens, all traces of what has happened have disappeared, and she cannot convince Tony, his partner Inspector &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson, or even her landlord Mr. Hennessy that she was attacked.

Gloria is abducted by Turk Farnum, the chauffeur of a limousine in which she earlier had seen Whitey riding, but she manages to subdue him with mace and brass knuckles given to her by her friend and fellow library employee, Stella. Upon further investigation, Tony discovers that Scotty, an undercover SFPD inspector who had received a tip that a major assassination would take place in the city on a certain night, was investigating contract killer Rupert Stiltskin (alias &quot;the Dwarf&quot;). Now assigned to protect Gloria from her would-be killers, Tony later takes her to his houseboat, where the two fall in love.

When Tony and Fergie discover that the limousine is registered to the archdiocese of San Francisco, they visit the office of Archbishop Thorncrest, unaware that their interviewee is actually the archbishop&#x27;s twin brother Charlie, who is involved in a plot to assassinate Pope Pius XIII during his upcoming visit to San Francisco, and has murdered his twin in order to impersonate him. The following day, Rupert kidnaps Fergie and uses him to lure Gloria into a trap. She manages to hide in a massage parlor, where she encounters Stanley yet again, but Whitey and Stiltskin then find and abduct her.
At Gloria&#x27;s request, Stella has researched an organization known as the Tax the Churches League, and discovered that the league is a radical fringe group founded by Delia Darrow and her husband. For the Darrows, organized religion is a corrupt, greedy sham involving powerful billion-dollar corporations. Stella gives the results of her findings to Tony, who returns to the archbishop&#x27;s residence with Mr. Hennessy. Sneaking into the wine cellar, Tony discovers the imprisoned Fergie, who informs him that the Darrow hired Stiltskin to assassinate the Pope during a performance of &quot;The Mikado&quot; at the San Francisco Opera House that evening. Tony is attacked by Rupert and kills him in self-defense by toppling shelves of wine upon him, but the fake archbishop&#x27;s assistant Gerda Caswell, who is really Delia Darrow, holds him and Gloria at gunpoint.

Darrow then details her &quot;contingency plan&quot; to eliminate the pope: if the pope is not dead at the end of act I, if he leaves his seat at any time, or if the police arrive, Whitey Jackson will open fire from one of the auditorium&#x27;s two organ bays. Mr. Hennessy knocks out Charlie and defeats Delia in a duel of martial arts, after which Tony and Gloria drive to the opera house, having some unusual problems along the way such as crashing into an Italian restaurant and commandeering an airport limousine carrying a pair of Japanese tourists. After making it backstage, Gloria is grabbed by Jackson, who kills one of several security guards who have joined the pursuit. An enraged Gloria attempts to attack Jackson, who simply shoves her to the floor. This gives Tony the room he needs to shoot the albino, thus thwarting the plan to kill the pope. When the albino falls from the rafters, he gets tangled in ropes and activates a lever that lowers a stage-length display of the ship H.M.S. Pinafore, which is unrelated to the current production. As the performance ends, Gloria and Tony are revealed onstage along with the now-dead bodies of Jackson and the guard, but the pope, who seems not to have noticed anything unusual, leads the audience in applause for the cast, the orchestra, and Stanley, who is hiding from Gloria as the conductor.

==Production==
&quot;Foul Play&quot; is an homage to director Alfred Hitchcock, several of whose films are referenced during the film. The premise of an innocent person becoming entangled in a web of intrigue is common in Hitchcock films, such as &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, &quot;Saboteur&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and, most notably, &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, which inspired the opera house sequence in &quot;Foul Play&quot;. When Gloria is attacked in her home by a man attempting to strangle her with a scarf and she defends herself with a household object, both are references to &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;. Other Hitchcock films which receive a nod from screenwriter/director Colin Higgins include &quot;Notorious&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;. In addition, the plot includes a MacGuffin—an object that initially is the central focus of the film but declines in importance until it is forgotten and unexplained by the end—in the form of the roll of film concealed in the pack of cigarettes which ends up being thrown into a fire in a fireplace. Hitchcock popularized the term MacGuffin and used the technique in many of his films.

&quot;Audiences love to be scared and at the same time they love to laugh&quot;, said Higgins. &quot;It is tongue in cheek realism. The audience is in on the joke but the actors must carry on as if they were unaware.&quot;

The script originally was written under the name &quot;Killing Lydia&quot; with Goldie Hawn in mind for the lead. Higgins had met Hawn through their mutual friend Hal Ashby. However, the project did not take off. After &quot;Silver Streak&quot; came out, Higgins rewrote the script. He and the producers took the project to Paramount who hoped to star Farrah Fawcett. However, Fawcett was in the middle of a legal battle with the producers of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; so it was decided to go with Hawn.

The name Gloria Mundy is a reference to &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi&quot;, Latin for &quot;Thus passes the glory of the world&quot;: the phrase was part of the rite of papal coronation until 1963.

Higgins had written the role of Stanley Tibbets for Tim Conway, but when the actor turned it down he offered it to Dudley Moore instead. It was Moore&#x27;s American film debut and led to his being cast in &quot;10&quot; by Blake Edwards the following year.

Higgins says when he sold the script he wanted to direct it so badly he did not care who was going to play the lead roles. He met with Fawcett to play the female lead before going with Goldie Hawn. His first choice for the male lead was Harrison Ford (who had been Higgins&#x27; carpenter) who turned it down. Steve Martin was offered the role but did not end up playing it. Higgins says he offered the part to another actor who wanted to play the cop and Stanley Tibbets. Eventually Chevy Chase was cast.

The film was shot in and around San Francisco, in locations including Noe Valley, the Mission District, Hallidie Plaza, Telegraph Hill, Hayes Valley, Nob Hill, Pacific Heights, Fort Mason, the Marina District, the Presidio, Potrero Hill, Japantown, and the War Memorial Opera House. The lobby scenes of the opera house were filmed in the rotunda of San Francisco City Hall across the street. The Nuart Theatre, in which Bob Scott dies early in the film, is an art house located on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles. The houseboat &quot;Galatea&quot; was located at 15 Yellow Ferry Dock in Sausalito.

&quot;Ready to Take a Chance Again&quot;, the film&#x27;s theme song, was composed by Charles Fox, with lyrics by Fox&#x27;s writing partner Norman Gimbel and performed by Barry Manilow, who conceived and supervised the song&#x27;s recording in partnership with Ron Dante. The soundtrack also includes &quot;Copacabana&quot; written by Manilow, Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman, and performed by Manilow; &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; by Carole King, and &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, written and performed by the Bee Gees. Excerpts from Act I of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;, conducted by Julius Rudel, are performed by members of the New York City Opera. Arista Records issued the album on LP and cassette, with Intrada Records reissuing it on compact disc in 2009. Varèse Sarabande released it in 2016, with Charles Fox&#x27;s theme for the television series as a bonus track.

A novelization, by James Cass Rogers, based upon the screenplay by Colin Higgins, was published by Jove Books in conjunction with the release of the film in 1978.

==Critical reception==
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a slick, attractive, enjoyable movie with all the earmarks of a hit. But as &quot;House Calls&quot; did a few months ago, it starts out promising genuine wit and originality only to fall back on more familiar tactics after a half-hour or so. If either film had a less winning opening, perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t leave a vague aftertaste of disappointment. Colin Higgins...has aimed for the same kind of thriller-comedy-romance hybrid he attempted in writing &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, and this time he&#x27;s much more successful ...Still, Mr. Higgins isn&#x27;t a facile enough juggler to keep the film&#x27;s diverse elements from colliding at times.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an excellent film&quot;, adding &quot;Writer Colin Higgins makes a good directorial bow. Goldie Hawn is superb in a strong return to pictures, and Chevy Chase, also above title, works well as a screen partner.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and called it &quot;an attractive minor comedy, the kind of film best described as &#x27;cute.&#x27;&quot; On a 1986 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, Roger Ebert called the film &quot;a very good picture.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that &quot;&quot;Foul Play&quot; does offer a kind of duplex pleasure—as a celebration of the movies the way they used to make them, sleek, funny, exciting but unworrying, and in its own terms as a vividly adventurous romantic comedy.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Foul Play&quot; never begins to make sense as a mystery story, and it&#x27;s not incidentally amusing or stylish. At best, the film can be accepted as a harmless assortment of fake-outs and distractions, alternating in tone from innocuous to vicious, from disarming to offensive.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; stated &quot;Unsatisfactory as a whole, the film is hilarious and tense in bits&quot; and noted &quot;while writer/director Higgins uses almost every stock thriller device...he approaches this semi-parody with more zest and originality than is common.&quot;

Channel 4 called the film &quot;a finely tuned and fast-paced offering which is chock-full of black comic twists and perfect casting.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 74% approval rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Entertaining and charming like its charismatic leads, &quot;Foul Play&quot; is a rollicking homage to the master of suspense for those who prefer mysteries with gags on top.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 45 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Kohima was the turning point of the Japanese U-Go offensive into India in 1944 during the Second World War. The battle took place in three stages from 4 April to 22 June 1944 around the town of Kohima, now the capital city of Nagaland in Northeast India. From 3 to 16 April, the Japanese attempted to capture Kohima ridge, a feature which dominated the road by which the besieged British and Indian troops of IV Corps at Imphal were supplied. By mid-April, the small British and British Indian force at Kohima was relieved.

From 18 April to 13 May British and British Indian reinforcements counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured. The Japanese abandoned the ridge at this point but continued to block the Kohima–Imphal road. From 16 May to 22 June the British and British Indian troops pursued the retreating Japanese and reopened the road. The battle ended on 22 June when British and British Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109, ending the Siege of Imphal.

In 2013, a poll conducted by the British National Army Museum voted the Battles of Kohima and Imphal as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Greatest Battle&quot;. The Battles of Kohima and Imphal have been referred to by authors such as Martin Dougherty and Jonathan Ritter as the &quot;Stalingrad of the East&quot;.

==Background==
The Japanese plan to invade India, codenamed U-Go, was originally intended as a spoiling attack against the British IV Corps at Imphal in Manipur, to disrupt the Allied offensive plans for that year. The commander of the Japanese Fifteenth Army, Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi, enlarged the plan to invade India itself and perhaps even overthrow the British Raj.

If the Japanese were able to gain a strong foothold in India they would demonstrate the weakness of the British Empire and provide encouragement to Indian nationalists in their decolonization efforts. Moreover, occupation of the area around Imphal would severely impact American efforts to supply Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s army in China. The objections of the staffs of various headquarters were eventually overcome, and the offensive was approved by Imperial General Headquarters on 7 January 1944.

Part of the plan involved sending the Japanese 31st Division (which was composed of the 58th, 124th and 138th Infantry Regiments and the 31st Mountain Artillery Regiment) to capture Kohima and thus cut off Imphal. Mutaguchi wished to exploit the capture of Kohima by pushing the 31st Division on to Dimapur, the vital railhead and logistic base in the Brahmaputra River valley.

The 31st Division&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant General Kotoku Sato, was unhappy with his role. He had not been involved in the planning of the offensive, and had grave misgivings about its chances. He had already told his staff that they might all starve to death. In common with many senior Japanese officers, Sato considered Mutaguchi a &quot;blockhead&quot;. He and Mutaguchi had also been on opposite sides during the split between the &quot;Toseiha&quot; and &quot;Kodoha&quot; factions within the Japanese Army during the early 1930s, and Sato believed he had reason to distrust Mutaguchi&#x27;s motives.

==Prelude==

Starting on 15 March 1944, the Japanese 31st Division crossed the Chindwin River near Homalin and moved north-west along jungle trails on a front almost wide. Because of a shortage of transport, half the artillery regiment&#x27;s mountain guns and the infantry regiments&#x27; heavy weapons were left behind. Only three week&#x27;s supply of food and ammunition was carried.

Although the march was arduous, good progress was made. The left wing of the division, consisting of the bulk of the 58th Regiment and commanded by the division&#x27;s Infantry Group commander, Major General Shigesaburō Miyazaki, was ahead of the neighbouring formation (the Japanese 15th Infantry Division) when they clashed with Indian troops covering the northern approaches to Imphal on 20 March.

The Indian troops were the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Maxwell Hope-Thomson, at Sangshak. Although they were not Miyazaki&#x27;s objective, he decided to clear them from his line of advance. The Battle of Sangshak continued for six days. The parachute brigade&#x27;s troops were desperately short of drinking water, but Miyazaki was handicapped by lack of artillery until near the end of the battle. Eventually, as some of the Japanese 15th Division&#x27;s troops joined the battle, Hope-Thomson withdrew. The 50th Parachute Brigade lost 600 men, while the Japanese had suffered over 400 casualties. Miyazaki had also captured some of the food and munitions that had been dropped by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to the defenders of Sangshak. However, his troops, who had the shortest and easiest route to Kohima, were delayed by a week.

Meanwhile, the commander of the British Fourteenth Army, Lieutenant General William Slim, belatedly realised (partly from Japanese documents that had been captured at Sangshak) that a whole Japanese division was moving towards Kohima. He and his staff had originally believed that, because of the forbidding terrain in the area, the Japanese would only be able to send a regiment to take Kohima.

Slim knew that there were few fighting troops, as opposed to soldiers in line-of-communication units and supporting services, in Kohima and none at all at the vital base of Dimapur to the north. Dimapur contained an area of supply dumps long and wide. As the fall of Dimapur would have been disastrous for the Allies, Slim asked his superior, General George Giffard (commanding Eleventh Army Group), for more troops to protect Dimapur and to prepare to relieve Imphal.

The Allies were already hastily reinforcing the Imphal Front. As part of this move, the infantry and artillery of the 5th Indian Infantry Division were flown from the Arakan, where they had just participated in the defeat of a subsidiary Japanese offensive at the Battle of the Admin Box. While the main body of the division went to Imphal (where some units had been isolated and almost all of IV Corps&#x27; reserves had already been committed), the 161st Indian Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Dermot Warren and with 24th Mountain Artillery Regiment, Indian Artillery attached, were flown to Dimapur.

Early in March, the 23rd Long Range Penetration Brigade was removed from Major General Orde Wingate&#x27;s Chindit force, and was dispatched by rail from around Lalaghat to Jorhat, north of Dimapur, where they could threaten the flank of any Japanese attack on the base. Giffard and General Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, also prepared to send the British 2nd Division and Indian XXXIII Corps HQ under Lieutenant General Montagu Stopford from reserve in southern and central India to Dimapur, by road and rail.

Until XXXIII Corps headquarters could arrive at Dimapur, the HQ of 202 Line of Communication Area under Major General R.P.L. Ranking took command of the area.

==Battle==
===Geography===

Kohima&#x27;s strategic importance in the wider 1944 Japanese Chindwin offensive lay in that it was the summit of a pass that offered the Japanese the best route from Burma into India. Through it ran the road which was the main supply route between the base at Dimapur in the Brahmaputra River valley and Imphal, where the British and Indian troops of IV Corps (consisting of the 17th, 20th and 23rd Indian Infantry Divisions) faced the main Japanese offensive.

Kohima Ridge itself runs roughly north and south. The road from Dimapur to Imphal climbs to its northern end and runs along its eastern face. In 1944, Kohima was the administrative centre of Nagaland. The Deputy Commissioner was Charles Pawsey. His bungalow stood on the hillside at a bend in the road, with its gardens and tennis court, and a clubhouse, on terraces above. Although some terraces around the village were cleared for cultivation, the steep slopes of the ridge were densely forested.

North of the ridge lay the densely inhabited area of &quot;Naga Village&quot;, crowned by &quot;Treasury Hill&quot;, and &quot;Church Knoll&quot; (Baptist and other Christian missionaries had been active in Nagaland over the preceding half century). South and west of Kohima Ridge were &quot;GPT Ridge&quot; and the jungle-covered &quot;Aradura Spur&quot;. The various British and Indian service troop encampments in the area gave their names to the features which were to be important in the battle e.g. &quot;Field Supply Depot&quot; became &quot;FSD Hill&quot; or merely &quot;FSD&quot;. The Japanese later assigned their own code-names to the features; for example, &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, which overlooked Kohima, was known as &quot;Inu&quot; (dog) and &quot;Kuki Piquet&quot; (see map of Kohima Ridge) as &quot;Saru&quot; (monkey).

===Siege===
Before the 161st Indian Brigade arrived, the only fighting troops in the Kohima area were the newly raised 1st Battalion, the Assam Regiment and a few platoons from the 3rd (Naga Hills) Battalion of the paramilitary Assam Rifles. Late in March 161st Brigade deployed in Kohima, but Major-General Ranking ordered them back to Dimapur, as it was felt initially that Dimapur had more strategic importance. Kohima was regarded as a roadblock, while Dimapur was the railhead where the majority of Allied supplies were stored. Slim also feared that the Japanese might leave only a detachment to contain the garrison of Kohima while the main body of the 31st Division moved by tracks to the east to attack Dimapur.

To Slim&#x27;s relief, Satō concentrated on capturing Kohima. (Early in the siege, on 8 April, Mutaguchi directly ordered Sato to send a detachment to advance on Dimapur. Satō unwillingly dispatched a battalion of the 138th Regiment but a few hours later Mutaguchi&#x27;s superior, Lieutenant General Masakasu Kawabe commanding Burma Area Army, vetoed the move.)

As the right wing and centre of the Japanese 31st Division approached Jessami, over by road to the east of Kohima, elements of the Assam Regiment fought delaying actions against them commencing on 1 April. Nevertheless, the men in the forward positions were soon overrun and the Assam regiment was ordered to withdraw. By the night of 3 April, Miyazaki&#x27;s troops reached the outskirts of the Naga village and began probing Kohima from the south.

Stopford&#x27;s Corps HQ took over responsibility for the front from Ranking on 3 April. The next day, he ordered the 161st Indian Brigade to move forward to Kohima again, but only one battalion, 4th Battalion Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Laverty, and a company of the 4th Battalion, 7th Rajput Regiment arrived in Kohima before the Japanese cut the road west of the ridge. Besides these troops from 161st Brigade, the garrison consisted of a raw battalion (the Shere Regiment) from the Royal Nepalese Army, some companies from the Burma Regiment, some of the Assam Regiment which had retired to Kohima and various detachments of convalescents and line-of-communication troops. The garrison numbered about 2,500, of which about 1,000 were non-combatants and was commanded by Colonel Hugh Richards, who had served formerly with the Chindits.

The siege began on 6 April. The garrison was continually shelled and mortared, in many instances by Japanese using weapons and ammunition captured at Sangshak and from other depots, and was slowly driven into a small perimeter on &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;. They had artillery support from the main body of 161st Brigade, who were themselves cut off away at Jotsoma, but, as at Sangshak, they were very short of drinking water. The water supply point was on &quot;GPT Ridge&quot;, which was captured by the Japanese on the first day of the siege. Some of its defenders were unable to retreat to other positions on the ridge and instead withdrew towards Dimapur. Canvas water tanks on &quot;FSD&quot; and at the Indian General Hospital had neither been filled nor dug in to protect them from fire. While a small spring was discovered on the north side of &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, it could be reached only at night. The medical dressing stations were exposed to Japanese fire, and wounded men were often hit again as they waited for treatment.

Some of the heaviest fighting took place at the north end of Kohima Ridge, around the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s bungalow and tennis court, in what became known as the Battle of the Tennis Court. The tennis court became a no man&#x27;s land, with the Japanese and the defenders of Kohima dug in on opposite sides, so close to each other that grenades were thrown between the trenches. The American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray wrote about the fighting at Kohima between the Japanese vs. the Anglo-Indian troops: &quot;Nowhere in World War II – even on the Eastern Front – did the combatants fight with more mindless savagery&quot;.

On the night of 17/18 April, the Japanese finally captured the DC&#x27;s bungalow area. Other Japanese captured &quot;Kuki Picquet&quot;, cutting the garrison in two. The defenders&#x27; situation was desperate, but the Japanese did not follow up by attacking &quot;Garrison Hill&quot; as by now they were exhausted by hunger and by the fighting, and when daylight broke, troops of 161st Indian Brigade arrived to relieve the garrison.

===Relief===
The British 2nd Division, commanded by Major General John M. L. Grover, had begun to arrive at Dimapur in early April. By 11 April, the Fourteenth Army had about the same number of troops in the area as the Japanese. The British 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division broke through Japanese roadblocks to relieve 161st Brigade in Jotsoma on 15 April. The British 6th Brigade took over 161st Brigade&#x27;s defensive position (the &quot;Jotsoma Box&quot;), allowing the 161st Brigade with air, artillery and armour support to launch an attack towards Kohima on 18 April. After a day&#x27;s heavy fighting, the leading troops of the Brigade (1st Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment) broke through and started to relieve the Kohima garrison. By this point, Kohima resembled a battlefield from the First World War, with smashed trees, ruined buildings and the ground covered in craters.

Under cover of darkness, the wounded (numbering 300) were brought out under fire. Although contact had been established, it took a further 24 hours to fully secure the road between Jotsoma and Kohima. During 19 April and into the early hours of 20 April, the British 6th Brigade replaced the original garrison and at 06:00 hours on 20 April, the garrison commander (Colonel Richards) handed over command of the area. 6th Brigade observers were taken aback by the condition of the garrison; one battle hardened officer commented: &quot;They looked like aged, bloodstained scarecrows, dropping with fatigue; the only clean thing about them was their weapons, and they smelt of blood, sweat and death.&quot;

Miyazaki continued to try to capture &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, and there was heavy fighting for this position for several more nights, with high casualties on both sides. The Japanese positions on &quot;Kuki Picquet&quot; were only from &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, and fighting was often hand-to-hand. On the other flank of &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, on the night of 26/27 April, a British attack recaptured the clubhouse above the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s bungalow, which overlooked most of the Japanese centre.

===Counter-offensive===

The Japanese reorganised their forces for defence. Their Left Force under Miyazaki held Kohima Ridge with four battalions. The divisional HQ under Sato himself and the Centre Force under Colonel Shiraishi held &quot;Naga Village&quot; with another four battalions. The much smaller Right Force held villages to the north and east.

To support their attack against the Japanese position, the British had amassed thirty-eight 3.7 Inch Mountain Howitzers, forty-eight 25-pounder field guns and two 5.5-inch medium guns. The RAF (chiefly Hurricane fighter-bombers of 34 Squadron and Vultee Vengeance dive-bombers of 84 Squadron) also bombed and strafed the Japanese positions. The Japanese could oppose them with only seventeen light mountain guns, with very little ammunition. Nevertheless, the progress of the British counter-attack was slow. Tanks could not easily be used, and the Japanese occupied bunkers which were very deeply dug in, well-concealed and mutually supporting.

While the British 6th Brigade defended &quot;Garrison Hill&quot;, the other two brigades of 2nd Division tried to outflank both ends of the Japanese position, in &quot;Naga Village&quot; to the north and on &quot;GPT Ridge&quot; to the south. The monsoon had broken by this time and the steep slopes were covered in mud, making movement and supply very difficult. In places the British 4th Brigade had to cut steps up hillsides and build handrails in order to make progress. On 4 May, the British 5th Brigade secured a foothold in the outskirts of &quot;Naga Village&quot; but lost it to a counter-attack. On the same day, the British 4th Brigade, having made a long flank march around Mount Pulebadze to approach Kohima Ridge from the south-west, attacked &quot;GPT Ridge&quot; in driving rain and captured part of the ridge by surprise but were unable to secure the entire ridge. Two successive commanders of British 4th Brigade were killed in the subsequent close-range fighting on the ridge.

Both outflanking moves having failed because of the terrain and the weather, the British 2nd Division concentrated on attacking the Japanese positions along Kohima Ridge from 4 May onwards. Fire from Japanese posts on the reverse slope of &quot;GPT Ridge&quot; repeatedly caught British troops attacking &quot;Jail Hill&quot; in the flank, inflicting heavy casualties and preventing them from capturing the hill for a week. However, the various positions were slowly taken. &quot;Jail Hill&quot;, together with &quot;Kuki Picquet&quot;, &quot;FSD&quot; and &quot;DIS&quot;, was finally captured on 11 May, after a barrage of smoke shells blinded the Japanese machine-gunners and allowed the troops to secure the hill and dig in.

The last Japanese positions on the ridge to be captured were the tennis court and gardens above the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s bungalow. On 13 May, after several failed attempts to outflank or storm the position, the British finally bulldozed a track to the summit above the position, up which a tank could be dragged. A Lee tank crashed down onto the tennis court and destroyed the Japanese trenches and bunkers there. The 2nd Bn, the Dorsetshire Regiment, followed up and captured the hillside where the bungalow formerly stood, thus finally clearing Kohima Ridge. The terrain had been reduced to a fly and rat-infested wilderness, with half-buried human remains everywhere. The conditions under which the Japanese troops had lived and fought have been described by several sources, including author Frank McLynn, as &quot;unspeakable&quot;.

The situation worsened for the Japanese as yet more Allied reinforcements arrived. The 7th Indian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Frank Messervy, was arriving piecemeal by road and rail from the Arakan. Its 33rd Indian Brigade had already been released from XXXIII Corps reserve to join the fighting on Kohima Ridge on 4 May. The 114th Indian Infantry Brigade and the Division HQ arrived on 12 May and (with 161st Brigade under command) the division concentrated on recapturing the &quot;Naga Village&quot; from the north. The independent 268th Indian Infantry Brigade was used to relieve the brigades of British 2nd Division and allow them to rest, before they resumed their drive southwards along the Imphal Road.

Nevertheless, when the Allies launched another attack on 16 May, the Japanese continued to defend &quot;Naga Village&quot; and &quot;Aradura Spur&quot; tenaciously. An attack on &quot;Naga Hill&quot; on the night of 24/25 May gained no ground. Another attack, mounted against both ends of &quot;Aradura Spur&quot; on the night of 28/29 May was even more decisively repulsed. The repeated setbacks, with exhaustion and the effects of the climate began to affect the morale of the British 2nd Division especially.

===Japanese retreat===

The decisive factor was the Japanese lack of supplies. The Japanese 31st Division had begun the operation with only three weeks&#x27; supply of food. Once these supplies were exhausted, the Japanese had to exist on meagre captured stocks and what they could forage in increasingly hostile local villages. (Shortly before the siege of Kohima began, the Japanese had captured a huge warehouse in &quot;Naga Village&quot; with enough rice to feed the division &quot;for three years&quot;, but it was immediately bombed and the stock of rice was destroyed.) The British 23rd LRP Brigade, which had been operating behind the Japanese division, cut the Japanese supply lines and prevented them foraging in the Naga Hills to the east of Kohima. The Japanese had mounted two resupply missions, using captured jeeps to carry supplies forward from the Chindwin to 31st Division, but they brought mainly artillery and anti-tank ammunition, rather than food.

By the middle of May, Satō&#x27;s troops were starving. He considered that Mutaguchi and the HQ of Japanese Fifteenth Army were taking little notice of his situation, as they had issued several confusing and contradictory orders to him during April. Because the main attack on Imphal faltered around the middle of April, Mutaguchi wished 31st Division or parts of it to join in the attack on Imphal from the north, even while the division was struggling to capture and hold Kohima. Satō considered that Fifteenth Army headquarters were issuing unrealistic orders to his division without proper planning or consideration for the conditions. Nor did he believe that they were exerting themselves to move supplies to his division. He began considering pulling his troops back to allow for resupply.

On 25 May, Satō notified Fifteenth Army HQ that he would withdraw on 1 June, unless his division received supplies. Finally on 31 May, he abandoned &quot;Naga Village&quot; and other positions north of the road, in spite of orders from Mutaguchi to hang on to his position. (For a divisional commander to retreat without orders or permission from his superior was unheard-of in the Japanese Army.) This allowed XXXIII Corps to outflank Miyazaki&#x27;s position on &quot;Aradura Spur&quot; and begin pushing south.

Miyazaki&#x27;s detachment continued to fight rearguard actions and demolish bridges along the road to Imphal, but was eventually driven off the road and forced to retreat eastwards. The remainder of the Japanese division retreated painfully south but found very little to eat, as most of what few supplies had been brought forward across the Chindwin had been consumed by other Japanese units, who were as desperately hungry as Satō&#x27;s men. Many of the 31st Division were too enfeebled to drag themselves further south than Ukhrul (near the Sangshak battlefield), where hospitals had been set up (but with no medicines, medical staff or food), or Humine south of Ukhrul, where Sato vainly hoped to find supplies.
Indian XXXIII Corps followed up the retreating Japanese. The British 2nd Division advanced down the main road, while the 7th Indian Division (using mules and jeeps for most of its transport), moved through the rough terrain east of the road. On 22 June, the leading troops of British 2nd Division met the main body of 5th Indian Infantry Division advancing north from Imphal at Milestone 109, south of Kohima. The siege of Imphal was over, and truck convoys quickly carried vital heavy supplies to the troops at Imphal.

During the Battle of Kohima, the British and Indian forces had lost 4,064 men, dead, missing and wounded. Against this the Japanese had lost at least 5,764 battle casualties in the Kohima area, and many of the 31st Division subsequently died of disease or starvation, or took their own lives.

==Aftermath==
After ignoring army orders for several weeks, Satō was removed from command of Japanese 31st Division early in July. The entire Japanese offensive was broken off at the same time. Slim derided Satō as the most unenterprising of his opponents, and even dissuaded the RAF from bombing Satō&#x27;s HQ because he wanted him kept alive, as doing so would help the Allied cause. Japanese sources, however, blame his superior, Mutaguchi, for both the weaknesses of the original plan, and the antipathy between himself and Sato which led Sato to concentrate on saving his division rather than driving on distant objectives.

After Satō was removed from command, he refused an invitation to commit seppuku and demanded a court martial to clear his name and make his complaints about Fifteenth Army HQ public. At Kawabe&#x27;s prompting, Satō was declared to have suffered a mental breakdown and was unfit to stand trial. He was replaced as commander of the 31st Division by Lieutenant General Tsuchitaro Kawada. Major General Miyazaki was promoted and appointed to command the Japanese 54th Division, serving in Arakan.

The huge losses the Japanese suffered in the Battles of Imphal and Kohima (mainly through starvation and disease) crippled their defence of Burma against Allied attacks during the following year.

On the Allied side, Major General Grover was dismissed from command of the British 2nd Division on 5 July, for perceived slowness in conducting the offensive, and also after complaints about his handling of Indian formations (161st and 33rd Indian Brigades) attached to his division, and replaced by Major General Cameron Nicholson. He accepted his dismissal stoically and was appointed Director of Army Welfare Services at the War Office. Seventy years after the Battle of Kohima a memorial to him was unveiled at Jotsoma, the site of his 2nd Division Headquarters. Brigadier Dermot Warren, who commanded the 161st Indian Brigade during the siege, was promoted to command the 5th Indian Division, but was killed in an air crash the following year.

===Aerial resupply===
The aerial resupply of Kohima was part of an effort that, at its height, delivered around 500 tons of supplies per day to Allied forces in the theatre. At the sieges of both Kohima and Imphal, the Allies relied entirely on resupply from the air by British and American aircraft flying from India until the road from the railhead at Dimapur was cleared. At Kohima, due to the narrow ridgelines, accuracy in the dropping of air delivered logistics proved to be a considerable problem and as the fighting intensified and the defended area decreased, the task became harder and more dangerous. In order to improve the accuracy of the drops, the Dakota pilots were forced to fly &quot;dangerously low&quot;.

The increasing dominance of Allied airpower by this stage of the Burma campaign was a major factor in helping the Allies turn the tide of the war in this theatre. Allied air supply enabled British and Indian troops to hold out in positions that they might otherwise have had to abandon due to shortages of ammunition, food and water, as reinforcements and supplies could be brought in even when garrisons were surrounded and cut off. Conversely, the Japanese found their own supply situation harder to resolve and in the end it was one of the deciding factors in the battle.

===Victoria Cross===
Three Victoria Crosses were awarded for actions during the Battle of Kohima:
* Lance Corporal John Pennington Harman, 4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, 161st Indian Infantry Brigade, 5th Indian Infantry Division. During heavy fighting around &quot;Detail Hill&quot; (FSD?) during the siege, he single-handedly took out two Japanese machine gun posts, the first on 7/8 April and a second on 8/9 April. He was killed withdrawing from the second attack and was later awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for these actions.
* Captain John Niel Randle, 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd British Infantry Division.
* Jemadar Abdul Hafiz, 9th Jat Regiment. At 18 years old Abdul Hafiz became the youngest VC recipient from the British Indian Army. He is buried in Imphal Indian War Cemetery.

===Memorial===

The War Cemetery in Kohima of 1,420 Allied war dead is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Garrison Hill, in what was once the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s tennis court. The epitaph carved on the memorial of the 2nd British Division in the cemetery has become world-famous as the Kohima Epitaph. It reads:
The verse is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875–1958), and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph written by Simonides to honour the Spartans who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

<text>Air Holland Charter B.V. was an airline based in the Netherlands. It operated passenger and cargo charters to Africa, Asia and the Mediterranean, as well as dry and wet leasing of aircraft to other airlines. It ceased operations on 25 March 2004. The airline was headquartered in Oude Meer, Haarlemmermeer.

==History==
Air Holland was founded in 1984 by John Block. It took a while for the airline to gain its operating certificate after KLM and Transavia Airlines attempted to stop the airline from getting it. In the early 1990s, Transavia Airlines attempted to purchase Air Holland but they were unsuccessful.

In 1991, Air Holland had to temporarily suspend all operations due to financial difficulties and a loss of DFL 30 million for the end of 1990. On 20 December 1991 Air Holland took to the skies again under A.R. Marx&#x27;s management. 

On 20 February 2004 Air Holland suspended its operations again. Its operations, flights, and aircraft were taken over by HollandExel from the Amsterdam businessman Erik de Vlieger. On 25 March 2004 the airline ceased operations due to financial difficulties.

==Fleet==
Air Holland only operated Boeing aircraft. Its fleet consisted of the following:

<doc id="1002721" wikidata="Q340548" url="?curid=1002721" title="Achlorhydria">
<text>Achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria refer to states where the production of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions of the stomach and other digestive organs is absent or low, respectively. It is associated with various other medical problems.

==Signs and symptoms==
Irrespective of the cause, achlorhydria can result as known complications of bacterial overgrowth and intestinal metaplasia and symptoms are often consistent with those diseases:
*gastroesophageal reflux disease
*abdominal discomfort
*early satiety
*weight loss
*diarrhea
*constipation
*abdominal bloating
*anemia 
*stomach infection
*malabsorption of food
*carcinoma of stomach

Since acidic pH facilitates the absorption of iron, achlorhydric patients often develop iron deficiency anemia. The acidic environment of stomach helps conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin, which is highly important in digesting the protein into smaller components, such as a complex protein into simple peptides and amino acids inside the stomach, which are later absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract.

Bacterial overgrowth and B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia) can cause micronutrient deficiencies that result in various clinical neurological manifestations, including visual changes, paresthesias, ataxia, limb weakness, gait disturbance, memory defects, hallucinations and personality and mood changes.

Risk of particular infections, such as &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; (commonly from seafood) is increased. Even without bacterial overgrowth, low stomach acid (high pH) can lead to nutritional deficiencies through decreased absorption of basic electrolytes (magnesium, zinc, etc.) and vitamins (including vitamin C, vitamin K, and the B complex of vitamins). Such deficiencies may be involved in the development of a wide range of pathologies, from fairly benign neuromuscular issues to life-threatening diseases.

==Causes==
* The slowing of the body&#x27;s basal metabolic rate associated with hypothyroidism.
*Pernicious anemia where there is antibody production against parietal cells which normally produce gastric acid.
* The use of antacids or drugs that decrease gastric acid production (such as H2-receptor antagonists) or transport (such as proton pump inhibitors).
* A symptom of rare diseases such as mucolipidosis (type IV).
* A symptom of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection which neutralizes and decreases secretion of gastric acid to aid its survival in the stomach.
* A symptom of atrophic gastritis or of stomach cancer.
* Radiation therapy involving the stomach.
* Gastric bypass procedures such as a duodenal switch and RNY, where the largest acid producing parts of the stomach are either removed or blinded.
* VIPomas (vasoactive intestinal peptides) and somatostatinomas are both islet cell tumors of the pancreas.
* Pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency.
* Chloride, sodium, potassium, zinc and/or iodine deficiency, as these elements are needed to produce adequate levels of stomach acid (HCl).
* Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that destroys many of the body&#x27;s moisture-producing enzymes.
* Ménétrier&#x27;s disease, characterized by hyperplasia of mucous cells in the stomach also causing excess protein loss, leading to hypoalbuminemia (presents with abdominal pain and edema).

== Risk Factors ==
Prevalence

Achlorhydria is present in about 2.5% of the population under 60 years old and about 5% of the population over 60 years old. The incidence increases to around 12% in populations over 80 years old. An absence of hydrochloric acid increases with advancing age. A lack of hydrochloric acid produced by the stomach is one of the most common age-related causes of a harmed digestive system.

Among men and women, 27% experience a varying degree of achlorhydria. US researchers found that over 30% of women and men over the age of 60 have little to no acid secretion in the stomach. Additionally, 40% of postmenopausal women have shown to have no basal gastric acid secretion in the stomach, with 39.8% occurring in females 80 to 89 years old.

Comorbidities

Autoimmune disorders are also linked to advancing age, specifically autoimmune gastritis, which is when the body produces unwelcomed antibodies and causes inflammation of the stomach. Autoimmune disorders are also a cause for small bacterial growth in the bowel and a deficiency of Vitamin B-12. These have also proved to be factors of acid secretion in the stomach. Autoimmune conditions can often be managed with various treatments; however, little is known about how or if these treatments effect achlorhydria.

Thyroid hormones can contribute to changes in the level of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Hypothyroidism is associated with a greater risk of developing achlorhydria.

Long term usage of medications or drugs

Extended use of anti-acids, antibiotics, and other drugs can contribute to hypochlorhydria. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are very commonly used to temporarily relieve symptoms conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcers. Risk increases as these drugs are taken over a longer time period, often many years, typically beyond the recommended therapeutic usage.

Stress can also be linked to symptoms associated with achlorhydria including constant belching, constipation, and abdominal pain.

== Diagnosis ==
For practical purposes, gastric pH and endoscopy should be done in someone with suspected achlorhydria. Older testing methods using fluid aspiration through a nasogastric tube can be done, but these procedures can cause significant discomfort and are less efficient ways to obtain a diagnosis.

A complete 24-hour profile of gastric acid secretion is best obtained during an esophageal pH monitoring study.

Achlorhydria may also be documented by measurements of extremely low levels of pepsinogen A (PgA) () in blood serum. The diagnosis may be supported by high serum gastrin levels ().

The &quot;Heidelberg test&quot; is an alternative way to measure stomach acid and diagnose hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria.

A check can exclude deficiencies in iron, calcium, prothrombin time, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and thiamine. Complete blood count with indices and peripheral smears can be examined to exclude anemia. Elevation of serum folate is suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Bacterial folate can be absorbed into the circulation.

Once achlorhydria is confirmed, a hydrogen breath test can check for bacterial overgrowth.

==Treatment==
Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause of symptoms.

Treatment of gastritis that leads to pernicious anemia consists of parenteral vitamin B-12 injection. Associated immune-mediated conditions (e.g., insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis) should also be treated. However, treatment of these disorders has no known effect in the treatment of achlorhydria.

Achlorhydria associated with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection may respond to &quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication therapy, although resumption of gastric acid secretion may only be partial and it may not always reverse the condition completely.

Antimicrobial agents, including metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, ciprofloxacin, and rifaximin, can be used to treat bacterial overgrowth.

Achlorhydria resulting from long-term proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use may be treated by dose reduction or withdrawal of the PPI.

==Prognosis==
Little is known on the prognosis of achlorhydria, although there have been reports of an increased risk of gastric cancer.

A 2007 review article noted that non-&quot;Helicobacter&quot; bacterial species can be cultured from achlorhydric (pH &gt; 4.0) stomachs, whereas normal stomach pH only permits the growth of &quot;Helicobacter&quot; species. Bacterial overgrowth may cause false-positive &quot;H. pylori&quot; test results due to the change in pH from urease activity.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth is a chronic condition. Retreatment may be necessary once every 1–6 months. Prudent use of antibacterials now calls for an antimicrobial stewardship policy to manage antibiotic resistance.

<doc id="1002728" wikidata="Q5449345" url="?curid=1002728" title="Final (band)">
<text>Final is a project of English musician Justin Broadrick, creator of the band Godflesh, which he started when he was 13 years old. Unlike Godflesh, Final is primarily electronic in nature, taking on a space-like, dark ambient sound.

==History==
Originally project was formed in 1982 as a power electronics/industrial duo of Justin Broadrick and Andy Swan (who Broadrick met at the city&#x27;s Rag Market and both shared an interest in power electronics and industrial bands such as Throbbing Gristle, Ramleh and Whitehouse) under name Atrocity Exhibition. The duo released cassettes on Post Mortem Rekordings, Justin Broadrick&#x27;s own cassette label (started in 1982 and ended in 1986). Later in 1983, the duo changed their name to Smear Campaign, and first performed live on 7 July 1984 in The Mermaid Pub in Birmingham, using Broadrick’s stepfather&#x27;s shortwave radio and distortion pedals. The played at the pub alongside Con-Dom and Family Patrol Group and was briefly signed on The Grey Wolves&#x27;s label, changing their name to Final after this show.

Beginning in 1982, Broadrick released over fifty tapes through his Post Mortem Rekordings label until 1986, many of which were Final tapes. Other contributors during this period included Guy Pearce, Nicholas Bullen (of &quot;Scum&quot; fame), Kevin Johnson, and Paul Neville. The music from this period is expected to receive a boxset reissue on Hospital Productions. In 1986, Final went on hiatus while Justin Broadrick played in Napalm Death and Head of David and later co-founded Godflesh. Andy Swan would later go on to form the bands Iroha and Khost, both of which Broadrick has remixed songs for.

Final was revived in 1993 as an experimental ambient solo project of Justin Broadrick meant to &quot;explore beat-less spaces&quot; and focus on textures, now expanding its influences to the likes of Brian Eno and Maurizio Bianchi. This new incarnation started utilizing electric guitar, tape decks, synthesizers and samplers. &quot;One&quot; was released on Sentrax and Subharmonic and was Final&#x27;s first ever CD release. &quot;2&quot; (1996) and &quot;3&quot; (2006), which both compiled pieces recorded over several years, were collaborations with Broadrick&#x27;s bass players: Godflesh&#x27;s G. C. Green and Jesu&#x27;s Diarmuid Dalton respectively. Two series of live improvised music were self released under the Final name on Avalanche Recordings, &quot;Infinite Guitar&quot; (2007-2009) and &quot;Guitar &amp; Bass Improvisations&quot; (2007-2013). A collaborative avant-garde drone album with Dirk Serries was also released in 2009, &quot;Final + Fear Falls Burning&quot;.

Final played its first live show in twenty years as support for The Living Jarboe in 2005, with a laptop as the only instrument. A European tour followed in 2006 alongside L&#x27;Enfance Rouge and a further show was played later that year at Supersonic Festival and as support for Isis at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties. One-off shows were played in Birmingham in 2009, during Broadrick&#x27;s Roadburn Festival residence in 2012 and as a double bill with the live debut of Council Estate Electronics in 2014. The Birmingham show saw a Bandcamp release as &quot;Live Reprocessed&quot; (2016). Dalton assisted Broadrick on some of these dates. Final played its first ever United States show on 8 December 2018 at Hospital Fest in Queens, New York City.

<doc id="1002731" wikidata="Q2328188" url="?curid=1002731" title="Yahoo Games">
<text>Yahoo! Games was a section of the Yahoo! website, launched on March 31, 1998, in which Yahoo! users could play games either with other users or by themselves. The majority of Yahoo! Games was closed down on March 31, 2014, and the balance was closed on February 9, 2016. Yahoo! announced that &quot;changes in supporting technologies and increased security requirements for our own Yahoo! web pages, made it impossible to keep the games running safely and securely&quot;. It was then announced by Yahoo! that its games section would be dissolved completely on May 13, 2016. However, the Yahoo! games service is still available on Yahoo! Japan, along with Yahoo! Auctions.

==Features==
The games on the web site were typically Java applets or quick Flash games, although some titles required a local download. Many of the games that required a download contained TryMedia Adware. Yahoo! Games also included Yahoo! Video Games, which provides news, previews, and reviews of currently available or upcoming First Party games–and Yahoo! Games on Demand–which provided free demos and full-size downloads of full PC games for a charge.

The site featured an &quot;All Star&quot; system for users, in which a user could pay to get an &quot;All Star&quot; username. &quot;All Star&quot; users were able to get extra privileges on Yahoo! Games sites such as disabling pop-up ads. &quot;All Star&quot; users did not have playable games without downloading.

Yahoo! Games was built on Yahoo!&#x27;s acquisition of ClassicGames.com (created by Internet entrepreneur Joel Comm and programmer Eron Jokipii) in 1997. The last used Yahoo! Video Games section of the site was formerly known as Games Domain, from back when Yahoo! acquired the web site in 2003. As of May 14, 2016, Yahoo! Games held over 1,400 games, most of which were developed externally.

Up until March 2014, Yahoo! Games included a popular Internet chess server. Ten years earlier, in 2004, James Eade had recommended Yahoo! Chess as the best of Internet chess, writing that &quot;action is to be found there at all times&quot;. Yahoo! Chess differed from more contemporary Internet chess servers in its complete lack of oversight regarding user conduct or chess engine use.

== In popular culture ==
Yahoo! Chess was the subject of a song by the British rock band Half Man Half Biscuit on their 2008 album &quot;&quot;. Entitled &quot;Bad Losers on Yahoo! Chess&quot;, the song references a fictitious player, Dennis Bell of Torquay, Devon, who on losing a chess game signs out from the Yahoo! Chess server &quot;Good game, Sir, do you want another bout? But Dennis ain&#x27;t replying &#x27;cos he&#x27;s just signed out.&quot; The song also references Deep Blue.

==Relaunch==
In around September 2023, Yahoo launched a redesigned Yahoo! Games section that is available for players in the United States only. The updated platform features a selection of classic games, like Jigsaw, Mahjong, Solitaire, Word etc.

<doc id="1002734" wikidata="Q283835" url="?curid=1002734" title="Carcass (band)">
<text>Carcass are an English extreme metal band from Liverpool, formed in 1985. The band have gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist Bill Steer and bassist-vocalist Jeff Walker as the only constant members. They broke up in 1996, but reformed in 2007 without original drummer Ken Owen, for health reasons. To date, the band have released seven studio albums, two compilation albums, four EPs, two demo albums, one video album, and six music videos.

Carcass were also one of the few death metal acts to sign to a major label, with Columbia Records handling North American distribution for &quot;Heartwork&quot;, while the album was distributed worldwide by Earache who released all of the band&#x27;s albums up to and including &quot;Swansong&quot; (1996).

==History==
===Early days (1985–1989)===
Carcass were first formed as a school band by Bill Steer and Ken Owen that soon after disbanded. Steer then joined the D-beat band Disattack with drummer Middie, Paul on bass and Pek on vocals. After releasing a four track demo entitled &quot;A Bomb Drops ...&quot; in 1986, the bass player left the band and was replaced by Jeff Walker, formerly guitarist and vocalist of the Electro Hippies. Vocalist Andrew Pek changed his name to Sanjiv after a visit to India. At about the same time, Bill Steer joined Napalm Death (replacing Justin Broadrick) and recorded the second side of what became Napalm Death&#x27;s first album, &quot;Scum&quot;. Walker also designed the cover art for &quot;Scum&quot;.

Disattack then changed its name to Carcass as the group changed musical direction. This led to a change in drummer and saw Ken Owen join the band. In April 1987, they recorded the &quot;Flesh Ripping Sonic Torment&quot; demo, the only Carcass recording featuring vocalist Sanjiv, who left shortly after. Walker, Steer and Owen shared vocal duties for the debut album, which was done in only four days. Despite the primitive production values of Carcass&#x27;s debut &quot;Reek of Putrefaction&quot; (1988), with which the band was very displeased, it became a favourite of Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Due to his interest, they were asked to participate in their first Peel Session in 1989, where they debuted new material for their second album. The Peel Session was released as an EP with the band members adopting pseudonyms: K. Grumegargler, J. Offalmangler, and W.G. Thorax Embalmer. Also that year, Steer and Walker appeared as members of Lister&#x27;s fictional band &quot;Smeg and the Heads&quot; in an episode of Red Dwarf.

===Progress (1989–1993)===
&quot;Symphonies of Sickness&quot; (1989), the second album, which contained a much improved production quality (courtesy of Colin Richardson), featured more death metal structures and longer songs with more slow passages. The second half of the tour in support of &quot;Symphonies of Sickness&quot; saw the addition of second lead guitarist Michael Amott, whose previous work included Carnage. Amott was to become a permanent member, playing on the second Peel Session and contributing material towards their third album.

&quot;Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious&quot; (1991) showed even more intricate composition, further improved production and guitar solos. Despite the addition of Amott to the ranks, Steer still handled all rhythm guitar duties, with Amott only contributing leads and one riff. Carcass again supported the album with heavy touring, and were part of the Earache &#x27;Gods of Grind&#x27; tour with Cathedral, Entombed and Confessor in both Europe and the United States. The &quot;Tools of the Trade&quot; EP was released in 1992 to coincide with the &quot;Gods of Grind&quot; tour.

===Columbia (1993–1995)===
The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Heartwork&quot;, was released in the UK in October 1993, and did not have a US release until three months later. It was considered a radical change by many fans, which eliminated Steer&#x27;s deeper vocals and the clinically gory lyrics. Again, Steer handled all rhythm guitar duties, this time due to Amott losing his passport in Israel (thus making him unable to return to England in time to record). Song structures, whilst still containing musically complex parts, were simpler, in some cases using the verse/chorus/verse formula.

After the release of &quot;Heartwork&quot;, Carcass signed a worldwide deal with Columbia Records, who hoped for commercial success, even suggesting that Jeff Walker learn how to sing. Michael Amott left the band right after &quot;Heartwork&quot; was recorded, and was for a while replaced by Mike Hickey, who was later replaced by Carlo Regadas.

During the summer of 1994, Walker remixed the track &quot;Inside Out&quot; for a Die Krupps remix album, although the version stayed fairly true to the original with the exception of Owen&#x27;s drum samples from &quot;Heartwork&quot; replacing the Die Krupps original, and additional mixing from Walker and Colin Richardson at Parr Street studios (where &quot;Heartwork&quot; was recorded).

Carcass now set about writing songs for their major label debut. During the December 1994 UK tour Carcass showcased two songs from their current writing sessions – &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Firmhand&quot;, both showing a more straightforward song writing approach than on previous efforts. Around this time, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was recorded for the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show sessions – a session which could be found on later compilation albums.

By late 1994, 17 songs were ready, and the band set about using their $200,000 advance to record the album, again with Colin Richardson, at Rockfield studios in Monmouth, South Wales in early 1995. During the 6-week recording schedule, the record label began to withdraw support, stating that Carcass were not ready to record, and needed to write more songs. This advice was ignored, as was the suggestion to have Terry Date remix the album, and the band continued. At the time, Jeff Walker stated in an interview with the UK&#x27;s Metal Hammer Magazine that the album was taking more of a classic rock approach, with drums, bass and twin guitars &quot;à la&quot; Thin Lizzy, in comparison to earlier &quot;multi-layered guitar&quot; productions. This has since been put down to Bill Steer&#x27;s unwillingness to perform the time-consuming guitar layering (as once again Steer performed all rhythm guitar) through losing interest in the metal genre.

During the &quot;Swansong&quot; recording sessions, Carcass were asked to remix the Björk track &quot;Isobel&quot;. This was not a remix as such but more of a re-recording with only Björk&#x27;s vocals remaining. The track saw the light of day in March 1996 on Björk&#x27;s &quot;Hyperballad&quot; single.

===Demise (1996–2006)===
Continuing record company problems with Columbia/Sony caused the album to be delayed from late summer 1995 to June 1996, in which time Carcass moved back to Earache Records, and broke up before even releasing &quot;Swansong&quot;. The move back to Earache was dubbed by Walker as &quot;the second great rock and roll swindle&quot; as they had effectively been paid twice for the same album. &quot;Swansong&quot; featured twelve of the seventeen tracks put to tape during the recording sessions. Walker has since stated in interviews that all seventeen songs should have been included in a double album, and that some songs omitted from &quot;Swansong&quot; were actually stronger than some of &quot;Swansong&quot;″s actual content. Carcass also remixed Killing Joke&#x27;s &quot;Democracy&quot; (by re-recording the music, but keeping the original vocals), although this time Regadas performed all guitar duties, as it is thought Steer had quit the band by early 1996. The Carcass &quot;Rooster Mix&quot; was made available on Killing Joke&#x27;s &quot;Democracy&quot;. Around the time of &quot;Swansong&quot;&#x27;s release, Carcass informed the press that they were ending the band without even a farewell tour, but most fans had guessed this may be the case via the album title.

The album sold well, staying near the top of the Indie Rock Chart in the UK for several months, above bands such as Placebo, despite having no touring support from the band. It is rumoured that the band were offered several lucrative tours in 1995, such as supporting Iron Maiden on their &quot;X-Factour 95&quot; tour, which had the album been released as expected in 1995, could have improved the band&#x27;s sales and longevity.

A posthumous compilation, &quot;Wake Up and Smell the... Carcass&quot; was released in October 1996 to collect together Carcass&#x27; rarer material, including unreleased material, songs only available on EPs and compilations, and live tracks. An accompanying video was released a few weeks after the &quot;Wake Up&quot; CD with little knowledge from the band or their management. The video, later released on DVD, featured five of the band&#x27;s promotional videos, a show from the Grindcrusher 1989 tour (as a three piece) and a show from the 1992 Gods of Grind tour. Sound on the two live shows is poor, particularly the latter, which Walker has described as &quot;unmixed&quot;.

Owen, Walker, and Regadas continued with the band Blackstar, accompanied by former Cathedral bassist Mark Griffiths, using the second &quot;Swansong&quot; advance from Earache to fund the recording. Blackstar, later Blackstar Rising, became defunct after drummer Owen suffered a severe cerebral hemorrhage. Amott went on to found hard rock band Spiritual Beggars and successful Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy. In the biggest musical departure, Steer formed Firebird, a Clapton-esque rock band.

===Reformation (2007–2012)===
In June 2006, in an interview with Walker, he discussed the possibility of reforming Carcass, but mentioned that it was unlikely that Owen would participate, since he could not replicate his former drumming proficiency due to the effects of the cerebral hemorrhage he suffered in 1999. In September 2007, Michael Amott announced that he was rehearsing with Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and Daniel Erlandsson (replacing Ken Owen) in secret to rehearse old Carcass songs for a possible reunion tour. The original plans were to play at several festivals during the summer, but they could not meet the deadlines.

In October 2007, Carcass were confirmed to play at German heavy metal festival Wacken Open Air and Finland&#x27;s Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2008. Carcass later embarked on a reunion tour, beginning on 6 June 2008 at the Sweden Rock Festival in Norje, Sweden. Carcass also played at Hellfest Summer Open Air, Metalcamp and several other festivals. The band toured Australia and New Zealand in 2008, and then in North America during September and October 2008, followed by the band&#x27;s first South American tour, playing in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. On 15 November 2008, Carcass headlined the Danish Metal Awards held in Amager Bio, Copenhagen, Denmark. Steer also presented the award for Best Danish Debut Album, which went to SCAMP for &quot;Mirror Faced Mentality&quot;. Carcass surprised the audience by bringing Ken Owen to the stage where he gave a brief drum solo to show how far he had come in recovering from his illness. Carcass performed an exclusive UK show at the Damnation Festival in Leeds. It was the first time Carcass had played in England in 14 years.

Carcass re-released their entire back catalogue with bonus material during 2008 on Earache Records. When asked if the band were planning on writing and recording a new album, Steer replied:

Carcass continued to play live in 2009, with a North American tour completed in March 2009. Carcass also headlined the Bloodstock Open Air in Derbyshire, England in August 2009. In August 2010, Carcass headlined Vagos Open Air in Vagos, Portugal, and Jalometalli Metal Music Festival held in Oulu, Finland. At Hellfest 2010, they performed the &quot;Necroticism&quot; album in its entirety. In 2012, Amott and Erlandsson left Carcass to focus on Arch Enemy.

===&quot;Surgical Steel&quot; (2012–2019)===

Steer and Walker started talking about recording a new album after the reunion shows were done. They wrote some songs to see how they would turn out. According to Steer, &quot;If it sounded like Carcass to us, we were going to proceed. We also said if it didn&#x27;t feel right, we&#x27;d just drop it&quot;. Carcass recorded a new album in 2012, titled &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;. Daniel Wilding (drummer of Bristol-based deathgrind band Trigger the Bloodshed) performs drums on &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;. The original drummer, Ken Owen, was also brought in to record some backing vocals on the album. Ben Ash (guitarist of Pig Iron, Desolation, and Liquefied Skeleton) joined the band in March 2013 on guitars.

On 26 March 2013 Carcass performed for the first time with their new lineup at the Camden Underworld in London, where they played for three nights. Carcass also performed at the Chilean music festival Metalfest in April 2013, and the Maryland Deathfest XI music festival in May 2013.

In May 2013 Carcass signed with Nuclear Blast. In Japan they signed a deal with Trooper Entertainment for the release of the new album. Carcass released &quot;Surgical Steel&quot; on 13 September 2013 in Europe, 16 September in the UK, and 17 September in North America. Overall the album received positive reviews. &quot;Surgical Steel&quot; earned a Top 50 position on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. After releasing &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;, Carcass headlined Damnation Festival in Leeds before embarking on the Defenders of the Faith Tour with Amon Amarth and Hell, which ran throughout Europe and the UK in November and December 2013. Carcass performed at 70000 Tons of Metal in January 2014 and headlined the Agglutination Festival on 23 August that year.

In a June 2014 interview with Metal Underground, Walker was asked if Carcass were going to make a follow-up to &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;. He replied, &quot;Ultimately, as long as we feel we got somewhere to go then we would create new material. We are not just going to do it just for the sake of it. We have to feel inspired. All I can say is I do see somewhere where we can take Carcass if we choose to do another album and personally I do want to do another album. I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with any album we&#x27;ve made so far. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve made the classic Carcass album, that&#x27;s the way I feel.&quot;

Carcass released an EP titled &quot;Surgical Remission/Surplus Steel&quot; in November 2014. The EP is a collection of unreleased tracks recorded during the &quot;Surgical Steel&quot; sessions and it is released on physical and digital formats. &quot;Well, let&#x27;s call this tying up loose ends,&quot; commented Walker. &quot;We thought we&#x27;d make all the tracks available from the &quot;Surgical Steel&quot; album session on an EP… just in case you bought the jewel case version, didn&#x27;t buy the digipak, didn&#x27;t buy the Japanese import, or maybe you never bought the Decibel magazine issue with the flexi disc? Well, here you go; ALL the songs on one disc along with a previously unreleased track. Even Trevor Strnad&#x27;s arm makes a guest appearance! Enjoy.&quot;

Carcass continued touring. They played at Download Festival in Castle Donington 13 June 2015. Reviewing their concert, James Weaver wrote: &quot;Carcass have proved, not only that they can play any spectrum of rock festivals, but that they still remain as one of the greats in the extreme metal genre.&quot; Carcass also headlined the &quot;Deathcrusher 2015&quot; tour alongside Napalm Death, Obituary, Voivod and Herod. The tour run in Europe October–November 2015. During the &quot;Deathcrusher 2015&quot; tour Bill Steer rejoined his former band Napalm Death on some dates to perform the classic Napalm Death song &quot;Deceiver&quot;. Along with Testament, Carcass supported Slayer on their &quot;Repentless&quot; tour, which took place in February and March 2016.

In a statement released in early March 2018, Ben Ash announced he had left Carcass. Tom Draper (Pounder, ex-Angel Witch), a UK native based in California, made his first live appearance with the band at the Netherlands Deathfest on 2 March 2018 and his second appearance during the Decibel Metal and Beer Fest in Philadelphia on 1 April 2018. They also opened for Slayer on selected dates of their final world tour, including ForceFest in Mexico in October 2018, and Hellfest in France in June 2019.

===&quot;Torn Arteries&quot; (2019–present)===
On 13 December 2019, Carcass released their first song in six years, &quot;Under the Scalpel Blade&quot;, on digital outlets. This track was also made available to deluxe &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine subscribers.

On 23 February 2020, Carcass announced on their Facebook page that their seventh studio album would be released on 7 August. A week-and-a-half later, guitarist Bill Steer revealed &quot;Torn Arteries&quot; as the title of the album, which is a reference to a demo tape recorded by Ken Owen when he was a teenager. On 2 April 2020, Carcass announced that the release of the album had been delayed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stating: &quot;Well there&#x27;s no way our new album is gonna get released in August now, what with the pandemic, CD &amp; vinyl manufacturers have closed and label distribution has been put on hold for the foreseeable future. There&#x27;s more pressing things to be concerned with right now, correct? Bunker down, look after yourselves, let&#x27;s see the next few months through and we&#x27;ll get the album released as soon as there&#x27;s some kind of return to &#x27;normality&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine later reported that the release of &quot;Torn Arteries&quot; had been postponed to 2021.

On 21 August 2020, Carcass announced that, with &quot;Torn Arteries&quot; still on hold, they would release a four-song EP called &quot;Despicable&quot; on 30 October. The new EP includes the previously released digital single &quot;Under the Scalpel Blade&quot;. Walker commented: &quot;Well, the COVID situation has put the release of the new Carcass album on the backburner for the time being. Given that we said there&#x27;d be new music in August, we thought it would be cool to have a stop-gap release and let you hear some of the tracks that never quite made the cut. Don&#x27;t say we never give you anything. Enjoy.&quot;

On 18 June 2021, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Meat Emporium&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Torn Arteries&quot;; on the same day, it was announced that the album would be released on 17 September 2021, just eight years following the release of its predecessor &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;. In order to promote the album, Carcass embarked on their North American spring 2022 headlining tour, first in six years, with support from Immolation and Creeping Death. They also supported Arch Enemy and Behemoth on their co-headlining European tour in the fall of 2022, and later supported Amon Amarth on their &quot;Great Heathen Army&quot; North American tour. Touring in support of &quot;Torn Arteries&quot; continued within the next two years, including a North American tour in the spring of 2023 with Sacred Reich, Municipal Waste and Creeping Death, and upcoming tours of Japan and Australia in early 2024, a tour of the latter country will include support from The Black Dahlia Murder. The band will also support Hatebreed on their 30th anniversary celebration tour in the fall of 2024.

When asked in March 2024 if Carcass have started working on their next album yet, Steer said, &quot;Not at the moment. I mean, as far as the eye can see, we&#x27;ve just got tours, dates, festivals. That would pretty much take us up towards the end of the year. And then beyond that, yeah, this is something that would just have to be kind of, in some way, discussed between the various bandmembers, because we had a similar situation after we released &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;. We got deep into touring, and after a couple of years, I think one or two of us thought, &#x27;Well, maybe now we should start gradually working on some new material,&#x27; but then you discover not everybody&#x27;s on the same page. So you go back and do another year or two of touring, and then before you know it, half a decade&#x27;s gone. So I&#x27;m kind of hoping we don&#x27;t mimic that situation too closely, because five years is a hell of a lot of time [between albums]. But, yeah, we&#x27;ve got to be at a point where everyone wants to record. So, if and when that time comes around, great. But it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s particularly close right now.&quot;

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
Carcass are regarded as among the pioneers of the grindcore and melodic death metal genres. They are also described as one of the earliest and most important of the new generation of grindcore and death metal bands. The band&#x27;s early releases, which have been described as &quot;&quot;Gray’s Anatomy&quot; set to music,&quot; were noted for their &quot;elaborately putrid&quot; vocabulary, which drew from medical terminology. Their early work was also tagged as &quot;splatter death metal&quot;, and &quot;hardgore&quot; on account of their morbid lyrics and gruesome album covers. Their fourth album, &quot;Heartwork&quot; (1993), is considered a landmark in the melodic death metal genre. Carcass are influenced by death metal and grindcore bands like Death, Repulsion, Master, Morbid Angel, Napalm Death and Macabre, as well as other acts such as Slayer, King Diamond, Cryptic Slaughter, Discharge, Siege, N.Y.C. Mayhem and Diamond Head. Additionally, Carcass have been called &quot;goregrind’s screaming birthers.&quot;

Frontman Jeff Walker&#x27;s vocal style has been described as &quot;.&quot;

Otrebor of black metal band Botanist cites Carcass&#x27; use of medical dictionary terms in lyrics and song titles as a precedent for its lyrics and song titles from plant and insect dictionaries. The late Trevor Strnad, who served as the vocalist for The Black Dahlia Murder until his death in 2022, had cited on many occasions that he was primarily influenced by Carcass in vocalizing technique. Deathcore and metalcore acts Bring Me the Horizon, Whitechapel, All Shall Perish, Killswitch Engage and All That Remains cited Carcass as an influence. Canadian pop punk band Sum 41 also cited them as an influence. American deathgrind band Cattle Decapitation has cited them as an influence as well.

=== In popular culture ===
In the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Timeslides&quot;, Steer and Walker appeared as members of Lister&#x27;s childhood band, &quot;Smeg and the Heads&quot;. During the Friends&#x27; episode &quot;The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress&quot;, Megan and Phoebe talks about Carcass. Megan told Monica that her fiancé wants them to play at their wedding.

<text>Bailey Gatzert (December 29, 1829 – April 19, 1893) was an American politician and the eighth mayor of Seattle, Washington, serving from 1875 to 1876. He was the first Jewish mayor of Seattle, narrowly missing being the first Jewish mayor of a major American city (Moses Bloom became mayor of Iowa City, Iowa, in 1873). , he has been the only Jewish mayor of Seattle.

Gatzert was born in 1829 in Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse, and emigrated to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1849, coming west four years later. In 1869 he opened a Seattle branch of Schwabacher Brothers and Company, a hardware and general store he managed as partners with his brothers-in-law Abraham, Louis, and Sigmund Schwabacher.

In addition to being mayor, Gatzert was charter member of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, served on the Seattle City Council 1872–1873 and 1877–1878 and was president of Puget Sound National Bank and Peoples Savings Bank. He co-founded Washington&#x27;s second synagogue (Seattle&#x27;s first), Ohaveth Shalom, which opened in 1892. Washington&#x27;s first synagogue was built in Spokane.

The famous sternwheeler &quot;Bailey Gatzert&quot; is named for him, as is an elementary school in Seattle.

<doc id="1002741" wikidata="Q1063242" url="?curid=1002741" title="Charisma Records">
<text>Charisma Records (also known as The Famous Charisma Label) was a British record label founded in 1969 by former journalist Tony Stratton Smith. He had previously acted as manager for rock bands such as The Nice, the Bonzo Dog Band and Van der Graaf Generator. Gail Colson was label manager and joint managing director.

The label&#x27;s most successful acts were Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Julian Lennon, and Monty Python. The first release was the eponymous debut LP by Rare Bird, in November 1969, who gave Charisma its first hit single, Sympathy, in early 1970. (Sympathy was a reworking of Giazotto&#x27;s &#x27;reconstruction&#x27; of Albinoni&#x27;s Adagio.)

Charisma&#x27;s first UK label was a distinctive magenta scroll design (though it is generally referred to in record collecting circles as &quot;pink scroll&quot;) – magenta was the colour that Stratton Smith chose to represent the label, and this was reflected in his later horseracing colours, red for Manchester United, green for Brazil, and magenta for Charisma. Its second logo (used beginning in 1972) of Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s drawing of the Mad Hatter (sometimes combined with a montage of other images from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;) made the label instantly recognizable. Much of the early distinctive artwork used by the label was created by Paul Whitehead. Whitehead&#x27;s original illustrations for three Genesis albums were stolen from the Charisma archives when it was sold to Virgin Records in 1983. Whitehead claimed that Charisma staff got wind of the imminent sale and proceeded to loot its office.

The label also released material by The Nice, Robert John Godfrey, Lindisfarne and Alan Hull, Hawkwind, The Alan Parsons Project, Clifford T. Ward, String Driven Thing, Jack The Lad, Audience, Vivian Stanshall, Brand X, Sir John Betjeman, Malcolm McLaren and Afraid of Mice. 1970s solo albums of Peter Hammill, Tony Banks and Steve Hackett were also on Charisma.

Gail Colson left Charisma in the late 1970s to form her own management company, Gailforce.

In 1983, Charisma Records was acquired by Virgin Records and continued to operate until 1986, when Virgin absorbed the label. Virgin&#x27;s purchase by EMI, then known as Thorn EMI, occurred in 1992. A new version of Charisma, with no connection to the original label other than the name, operated between 1990 and 1992, with a street-oriented and independently distributed subsidiary called Cardiac Records. Some Charisma Records recordings were re-issued on the EMI label. In the UK, the label was revived by EMI&#x27;s Angel Records in 2007.

With most of EMI&#x27;s purchase by Universal Music Group, Charisma returned to Virgin Records.

==Distribution==
Charisma was initially manufactured and distributed in the United Kingdom via a licensing deal with Lee Gopthal&#x27;s B&amp;C Records, sharing the B&amp;C catalogue series for both singles and albums, prior to B&amp;C ceasing to release records on the B&amp;C label, when it concentrated on marketing instead. In early 1972, B&amp;C brokered a deal with Precision Tapes to manufacture and distribute Charisma&#x27;s albums in tape format. From early 1970, Charisma&#x27;s European distribution was handled by Phonogram Inc.

In the United States and Canada, Charisma recordings were initially licensed to other labels. These included ABC Records, along with subsidiaries, Impulse, Probe and Dunhill. Artists included Van der Graaf Generator and Genesis. Elektra Records in the US released records by Charisma artists Atomic Rooster, Audience, Lindisfarne and Jack the Lad.

In 1971, Charisma entered into a distribution agreement with Buddah Records and began to release albums on the Charisma label in the US. These included &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot; by Van der Graaf Generator and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Genesis Live&quot; by Genesis. Atlantic Records also later released Charisma recordings in the United States from 1973 to 1974 including many Genesis titles.

In 1973, Atlantic stopped distributing Charisma in America; as a result, in the US Charisma&#x27;s bands signed to various labels such as Mercury Records (Van der Graaf Generator) and Arista Records (Monty Python). Genesis records were released in the US under Atlantic&#x27;s subsidiary label Atco Records from 1974 to 1976. In 1976, Charisma signed a new distribution deal in the UK with Polydor that lasted until 1980. In Canada, many Charisma releases were distributed by GRT and PolyGram Canada.

Between 1980 and 1982, Charisma operated a subsidiary called Pre Records, who were devoted to new wave and reggae acts. Pre&#x27;s roster included Scars, Prince Far I, Delta 5, Gregory Isaacs, The Monochrome Set and Congo Ashanti Roy, amongst others. Pre also licensed albums by The Residents and Tuxedomoon from the American label Ralph Records. In Europe, Pre&#x27;s releases were issued on the Charisma label.

==Collectable &quot;pink scroll&quot; label design==
Most Charisma artists were relatively unknown early on, so original pressings have become quite rare and sought after by collectors. The &quot;pink scroll&quot; label was first used in the UK from 1969 until mid-1972. This was replaced by the Mad Hatter label, designed by Paul Whitehead. In the US, the pink scroll labels were used in late 1973 and early 1974 on releases distributed by Buddah. Releases distributed by Atlantic Records used a variation of the Mad Hatter design.

<doc id="1002744" wikidata="Q1364310" url="?curid=1002744" title="Sustainable transport">
<text>Sustainable transport is transportation sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system. Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels. In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector. Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.

Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility, with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options. The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, a component of particulate matter, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality. The term &quot;green mobility&quot; also refers to clean ways of movement or sustainable transport.

The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people&#x27;s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion. Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, sustainable cities.

The term sustainable transport came into use as a logical follow-on from sustainable development, and is used to describe modes of transport, and systems of transport planning, which are consistent with wider concerns of sustainability. There are many definitions of the sustainable transport, and of the related terms sustainable transportation and sustainable mobility. One such definition, from the European Union Council of Ministers of Transport, defines a sustainable transportation system as one that:
* Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and ecosystem health, and promotes equity within and between successive generations.
* Is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers a choice of transport mode, and supports a competitive economy, as well as balanced regional development.
* Limits emissions and waste within the planet&#x27;s ability to absorb them, uses renewable resources at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the use of land and the generation of noise.
Sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A life-cycle assessment involves production, use and post-use considerations. A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency.

== Benefits ==
Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of serious reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), sustainable transport can help create jobs, improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes, pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways, make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people&#x27;s time and household income as well as government budgets, making investment in sustainable transport a &#x27;win-win&#x27; opportunity.

==Environmental impact==


Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three-quarters coming from road vehicles. Data from 2011 stated that one-third of all greenhouse gases produced are due to transportation. Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum. Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is embodied in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways. Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.

The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to Theodore Von Karman. After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis. Chester and Orwath, have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure.

The environmental impacts of transport can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles, sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and cycling environment in cities, and by enhancing the role of public transport, especially electric rail.

Green vehicles are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle this may not be the case.

Electric vehicle technology significantly reduces transport CO2 emissions when comparing battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). The extent to which it does this depends on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. Lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions from BEVs are significant, even in countries with relatively high shares of coal in their electricity generation mix, such as China and India. As a specific example, a Nissan Leaf in the UK in 2019 produced one third of the greenhouse gases than the average internal combustion car.

The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24 km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100 kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17 cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface. At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables. Hybrid vehicles, which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine, are already common.

Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel, but is a less promising technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions (though lower than gasoline, diesel, etc.).

Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from bioethanol in 2007, but the OECD has warned that the success of (first-generation) biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances. Internationally, first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.
The later generation biofuels however (2nd to 4th generation) do have significant environmental benefit, as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the food vs fuel issue.

In practice there is a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronized public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.

Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see fuel efficiency in transportation).

== Transport and social sustainability ==

Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in public transport, walking, and cycling. In many cases, streets became void of &quot;life.&quot; Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15 a.m. increases 30% during the school year.

Yet another impact was an increase in sedentary lifestyles, causing and complicating a national epidemic of obesity, and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs.

Car-based transport systems present barriers to employment in low-income neighborhoods, with many low-income individuals and families forced to use cars they cannot afford to maintain their income.
==Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries==
In developing countries such as Uganda, researchers have sought to determine factors that could possibly influence travelers to opt for bicycles as an alternative to motorcycle taxis (Bodaboda). The findings suggest that generally, the age, gender, and ability of the individual to cycle in the first place are key determinants of their willingness to shift to a more sustainable mode. Transport system improvements that could reduce the perceived risks of cycling were also seen to be the most impactful changes that could contribute towards the greater use of bicycles.

==Cities==


Cities are shaped by their transport systems. In &quot;The City in History&quot;, Lewis Mumford documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.

In 1939, the New York World&#x27;s Fair included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system. In this &quot;greater and better world of tomorrow&quot;, residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.
The emergence of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities. There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of Jane Jacobs, in particular The Death and Life of Great American Cities provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked &quot;is the city for cars or for people?&quot; Donald Appleyard documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in &quot;The View from the Road&quot; (1964) and in the UK, Mayer Hillman first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971. Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership, car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.

Mainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met &quot;if the contribution to societal welfare is positive&quot;, and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic. Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land-use planning, notably Curitiba, Brazil, Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada.

There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design.

The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighborhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people who have access to cars.

The European Commission adopted the Action Plan on urban mobility on 30 September 2009 for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU&#x27;s GDP is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise) and competitiveness (congestion) terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility, families and children.

The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is a group of 94 cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens. In October 2019, by signing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, 35 mayors recognized that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air. Papers have been written showing with satellite data that cities with subway systems produce much less greenhouse gas.

==Policies and governance==

=== By country ===

==== United Kingdom ====
In 2021 the Institute for Public Policy Research issued a statement saying that car use in the United Kingdom must shrink while active transport and public transport should be used more. The Department for Transport responded that they will spend 2 billion pounds on active transport, more than ever, including making England and the rest of the UK&#x27;s railways greener. UK studies have shown that a modal shift to rail from air could result in a sixty fold reduction in CO2 emissions.

==== Germany ====
Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations. An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg, Germany. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.

==== United States ====
Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars. Therefore, automobiles are one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:
* Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.

Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies.

==== France ====
In March 2022, an advertising regulation will come into force in France, requiring all advertising materials for automobiles to include one of three standard disclaimers promoting the use of sustainable transport practices. This applies to all vehicles, including electric vehicles. In 2028, it will also become illegal to advertise vehicles which emit more than 128 grams of carbon dioxide per-kilometer.

=== At city level ===
Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level.

Some of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport. In Paris 53% of trips are made by walking, 3% by bicycle, 34% by public transport, and only 10% by car. In the entire Ile-de-France region, walking is the most popular way of transportation. In Amsterdam, 28% of trips are made by walking, 31% by bicycle, 18% by public transport and only 23% by car. In Copenhagen 62% of people commute to school or work by bicycle.

Outside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include Curitiba, Brazil; Bogota, Colombia; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, Canada. The state of Victoria, Australia passed legislation in 2010 – the Transport Integration Act – to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.

Many other cities throughout the world have recognized the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining the Cities for Climate Protection program. Some cities are trying to become car-free cities, e.g., limit or exclude the usage of cars.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase biking and walking; these included Milan, London, Brighton, and Dublin. These plans were taken to facilitate social distancing by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in traffic congestion and air pollution from increase in car use. A similar plan was adopted by New York City and Paris. The pandemic&#x27;s impact on urban public transportation means revenue declines will put a strain on operators&#x27; finances and may cause creditworthiness to worsen. Governments might be forced to subsidize operators with financial transfers, in turn reducing resources available for investment in greener transportation systems.

===Community and grassroots action===
Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognized as of citywide, national and international significance.

Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.

An organization called Greenxc started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to carpool by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography. Ride-sharing reduces individual&#x27;s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.

At the beginning of the 21st century, some companies are trying to increase the use of sailing ships, even for commercial purposes, for example, Fairtrannsport and New Dawn Traders They have created the Sail Cargo Alliance.

The European Investment Bank committed €314 million between 2018 and 2022 to green marine transport, funding the building of new ships and the retrofitting of current ships with eco-friendly technologies to increase their energy efficiency and lower harmful emissions. The Bank also offered an average of €11 billion per year from 2012 to 2022 for sustainable transportation solutions and climate-friendly initiatives. In 2022, railway projects received around 32% of overall transport loans, while urban mobility received approximately 37%.

==Recent trends==

Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex. Oil price rises from 2003 have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US, Britain and Australia. In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.
Other factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of Baby Boomers who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the Great Recession, and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.

===Greenwashing===
The term &quot;green transport&quot; is often used as a greenwash marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman has targeted car manufacturers who claim that their cars are &quot;green&quot;, &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;. Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) describes &quot;green&quot; claims on products as &quot;very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them&quot;. In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its &quot;green&quot; marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be &quot;misleading&quot;. 
== Tools and incentives ==
Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The European Cyclists&#x27; Federation, which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview. In the UK, employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars. Since 2010, there has been a scheme in Iceland (Samgöngugreiðslur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like. Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free. Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period.

===Possible measures for urban transport===
The EU Directorate-General for Transport and Energy (DG-TREN) has launched a program which focusses mostly on urban transport. Its main measures are:


== History ==

Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined. Walking, the first mode of transport, is also the most sustainable. Public transport dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by Blaise Pascal in 1662. The first passenger tram began operation in 1807 and the first passenger rail service in 1825. Pedal bicycles date from the 1860s. These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to World War II, and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.

===Mass motorization===
The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979, with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of Urban Planning and identified induced demand as a pivotal change from &quot;predict and provide&quot; toward a sustainable approach incorporating land use planning and public transit. Public investment in transit, walking and cycling declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.

Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.

Transport innovations dating from this period include high-occupancy vehicle lanes, citywide carpool systems and transportation demand management. Singapore was the first country in the world to implement congestion pricing in 1975, and Curitiba began implementing its Bus Rapid Transit system in the early 1980s.

Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980 to 2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as urban sprawl. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.

At the same time, the academic foundations of the &quot;predict and provide&quot; approach to transport were being questioned, notably by Peter Newman in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.

The British Government&#x27;s White Paper on Transport marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that
We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible – and would not work.

A companion document to the White Paper called &quot;Smarter Choices&quot; researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.

A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration, was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.

<text>The La Pêche River () is a river in western Quebec, in Canada, which drains La Pêche Lake (&quot;Lac La Pêche&quot;) in Gatineau Park and empties into the Gatineau River at Wakefield.

== Geography ==
The south shore of La Pêche Lake is just north of the Ottawa River. The mouth of the lake is at in direct line from the mouth of the La Pêche river.

From its source at La Pêche Lake in the Pontiac municipality, the La Pêche River flows for about to the east, partly in the Gatineau Park, sometimes in woodlands, agricultural or urban. La Pêche Lake receives water discharges of several lakes (to the west and north), including: Martin, Serpent, à Guilbeault, Fisher, Trois Monts, Malverson, du Loup and La Loutre. The mouth of La Pêche Lake is at its northern end.

La Pêche river flows towards the north-east, then east, where it will run along more or less the 366 West Main Road to its mouth. On its way to the east, La Pêche River collects various branches dumps lakes:
* South side - Branch of Eardley, including lakes: Ben, Hawley, Blind, Ramsay, Kidder, Gervais, Richard and Leblanc;
* South side - Branch of &quot;chemin du lac-Philipe&quot; (Road of Lake-Philipe), including lakes: Racine, Monette and Kingbury;
* North side - Outlet of lake Gingras.
* North side - Branch of Kennedy Road, particularly lakes: Gauvreau, Jean-Venne, Anderson and Kennedy;
* North side - Branch of &quot;chemin Horace-Cross&quot; (Road Horace-Cross), particularly lakes: Wills, Fraser and Bell.

La Pêche river empties into the Gatineau River at south of the covered bridge of Wakefield, northern sector of the city of Gatineau, and upstream of the mouth of the Gatineau River in Ottawa River.

== Toponymy ==
At the beginning of the 19th century, Joseph Bureau, among other explorers, described this lake as a very fishy lake, abounding especially pike and trout. Accessibility of La Pêche Lake, near the Ottawa River and Ottawa city, in (Ontario), favoured sport fishing.

The toponym &quot;La Pêche River&quot; was recorded as of December 24, 1976, at the &quot;Bank of place names&quot; in Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec). The toponyms of the lake and river are related together.

== History ==
A grain mill was built in 1838 on the river at MacLaren Falls near Wakefield and is now operated as an inn, the Moulin Wakefield Inn and Spa. A textile mill and a sawmill at the same location helped to provide the impetus for the development of a settlement at Wakefield.

<text>Charles Jackson &quot;Bud&quot; Wildman (born June 3, 1946) is a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) from 1975 to 1999, representing the riding of Algoma, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae.

==Background==
He was educated at Carleton University, the McArthur College of Education at Queen&#x27;s University, and Algoma University. He lived in Echo Bay, Ontario after graduating, and worked as a high school history teacher. He and his wife raised four children. His son Jody Wildman is a municipal politician who, after first being elected as a councillor in 2000, has represented the Township of St. Joseph as mayor since 2003.

==Politics==
Wildman was elected to the legislature in the provincial election of 1975, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Bernt Gilbertson by 398 votes. Wildman&#x27;s victory was regarded by many as an upset; he received support from NDP bastions such as Wawa, but also from more traditionally Conservative areas on the north shore of Lake Huron.

He was re-elected by an increased margin over PC candidate Dave Liddle in the 1977 election, and retained his seat by significant margins in the elections of 1981, 1985, 1987, 1990 and 1995.

Wildman supported Jim Foulds&#x27;s bid to lead the provincial NDP in 1982.

===Government===
The NDP won the 1990 provincial election, and Wildman was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for Native Affairs on October 1, 1990. He was promoted to Minister of the Environment and Energy on February 3, 1993.

As Natural Resources minister, Wildman initiated the first public audit of Ontario&#x27;s forest resources and promoted an ecosystem management approach for forest harvesting. Ontario&#x27;s Environmental Bill of Rights was also approved during his tenure as Minister of Environment and Energy.

As Minister responsible for Native Affairs during the entire tenure of the Rae government, Wildman instituted a regime of dealing with First Nations on a government to government basis, signing a &quot;Statement of Political Relationship&quot; with Ontario First Nation Chiefs, and concluded a number of land claims settlements. He also established the Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy, which sought to address health problems among native peoples in a culturally sensitive manner.

In January 1991, Wildman issued an order permitting members of the Golden Lake First Nation to hunt and fish in Algonquin Park pending settlement of the band&#x27;s claim of the Ottawa Valley which included the park. However a broad coalition of park users protested the order and formed a group called the &quot;Adhoc Committee to Save Algonquin Park&quot;. The committee was eventually dissolved once the claim was settled which restricted hunting in the park.

===Cabinet positions===

===Return to opposition===
The NDP were defeated in the 1995 general election and reduced to third-party status, although Wildman retained the Algoma riding by a reduced margin. Rae resigned as leader the next year and Wildman served as interim leader in the legislature from February 10, 1996 until June 24, 1996 when Howard Hampton took over the position after his victory in that year&#x27;s Ontario NDP leadership convention. Wildman had been approached by the NDP&#x27;s northern Ontario MPPs about running for the leadership of the party but declined.

The Algoma riding was radically redistributed in 1996, merging with the neighbouring riding of Algoma—Manitoulin and incorporating other territory from surrounding ridings as well. Wildman decided not to run in the 1999 election, and retired from provincial politics after almost a quarter century at Queen&#x27;s Park.

===Federal politics===
Wildman attempted to win a seat in the federal House of Commons in the 2000 federal election, running in Sault Ste. Marie for the New Democratic Party. The NDP actively targeted this seat as winnable, and party leader Alexa McDonough visited the riding very late in the campaign. Wildman was however unsuccessful, finishing second against Liberal incumbent Carmen Provenzano.

==Later life==
Since leaving politics Wildman has worked as a consultant. He served as the Chair of the Board of Governors of Algoma University. Wildman was also a member of the board of directors of the Sault Ste. Marie and District Group Health Centre.
In 2021, Wildman was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Algoma University, in recognition of his 24 years—seven terms—of service as MPP for Algoma and in the government of Ontario, as Minister of Natural Resources, Minister responsible for Native Affairs and Minister of Environment and Energy between 1990 and 1995, as well as his community volunteerism subsequent to his retirement from electoral politics, serving as Chair of the Algoma University Board of Governors and as Chair of the Sault Group Health Association Board of Directors.

<doc id="1002755" wikidata="Q1375705" url="?curid=1002755" title="Challenge International de Tourisme 1929">
<text>The Challenge 1929 was the first FAI International Tourist Plane Contest (), that took place between August 4 and August 16, 1929 in Paris, France. Four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe.
==Overview==
The contest was conceived by the Aéro-Club de France, inspired by the International Light Aircraft Contest, in France in 1928. The idea of a tourist plane contest was approved by the FAI, and the first Challenge was to be organized by the French.

The contest was opened on August 4, 1929 in Paris. It consisted of two parts: technical trials of aircraft and a rally over Europe. Since one of the aims of the Challenge was to generate a progress in aircraft building, it was not only pilots&#x27; competition, but technical trials also included a construction evaluation, to build more advanced tourist planes.

55 aircraft entered the Challenge in 1929, from six countries: Germany (24 crews), Italy (12 crews), France (9 crews), United Kingdom (5 crews), Czechoslovakia (3 crews), and Switzerland (2 crews). In some teams there were also foreign aviators, e.g. in the German team there was the Canadian John Carberry, flying a German RK-25 aircraft; in the French team there were two Belgians. Among the British team, there was one woman Winifred Spooner (the second, Lady Mary Bailey, eventually flew the rally apart from the contest). All planes flew with two-men crews, pilot and passenger or mechanic.
==Aircraft==
The aircraft in the contest were popular sport planes of the late twenties years, like de Havilland Gipsy Moth (DH-60G), which was the main aircraft of the British team. These aircraft had mostly open cabs, built in low-wing, high-wing or biplane layout. Unlike in the following years, there were no aircraft built specially for a Challenge contest, only the Czech Avia BH-11B&#x27;s &quot;Antilopa&quot; were improved by adding folding wings. All aircraft in the contest had fixed landing gear and had no wing mechanization. The most numerous were German BFW M.23b (9 aircraft) and Klemm (6 of the L.25 Ia model, including 2 in the Swiss team, and 2 of the L.26 model). BFW&#x27;s and Klemms were wooden low-wing planes with open two-seater tandem cabins.
==Technical trials==

The first part of the contest were technical trials, starting on August 4. Unlike the following Challenges, it was not too complicated and consisted of a technical evaluation, quick engine start test, quick wing folding test and fuel consumption trial only.

The first was a technical evaluation of competing planes&#x27; construction. Such features, like twin controls, rich set of controls, wheel brakes, fire safety devices and a room for parachutes, could bring up to 18 points. Most points was given to the Italian Breda Ba-15s (11.75 to 12 pts) and German all-metal Junkers A50s (11.75 pts). Very good result of 11.25 points was obtained also by the Italian Fiat AS.1s and Romeo Ro-5s. The German BFW M.23b were given only 9.5 points, DH-60s - from 9.5 to 10.5 points, and the lowest result was 8 points (Caudron C.113).

After quick wings&#x27; folding and quick engine starting tests, the classification leader was the Czech Josef Novak flying an Aero A.34 biplane, with 17.5 pts. Behind him, there were three Italians flying Romeo Ro-5 biplanes (17.25 pts), then the rest. The best German pilot, Wolf Hirth, had 16.25 pts (12th place, Klemm L.25), but most Germans had a few points less. Some planes were handicapped, not having folding wings. Some crews completed wings&#x27; folding trial on 6 August.

The last was a fuel consumption test, on 6 x 50 km closed circuit, on 5 August. It could bring up to 20 points. The best result was obtained by the German Johannes Nehring flying a Darmstadt D-18 biplane (18.5 pts), then the Swiss Hans Wirth (Klemm L.25), three German Junkers A50 and two Czech Avia BH-11s, with 15-17 pts. The German Klemms also were good at this trial, with 12-14.5 pts.

The fuel consumption trial changed the general classification order. The three leaders, with 32 pts each, became Johannes Nehring (Darmstadt D-18), the Swiss Hans Wirth (Klemm L.25) and the Czech František Klepš (BH-11). Further places, from the 4th to the 10th, were occupied by the German crew of Klemms and Junkers&#x27;, with 29,5 - 30,5 pts, the best of them was Robert Lusser. The best Englishman, Hubert Broad, was on the 15th place, while Winifred Spooner was on the 25th place (22.5 pts). The German BFW M.23b&#x27;s occupied poor positions, the best result of the BFW was 25 pts, while Fritz Morzik flying BFW gained only 19.5 pkt, what gave him the 30th place. John Carberry, flying the German RK-25, occupied the last 47th place with mere 12 pts. The point differences were not high, but they were not easy to level during the next part of the contest.

Eight crews dropped out during technical trials, mostly due to engine malfunctions during the last trial. After having dropped out in a fuel consumption trial, the German Arado L.1 was crashed by its designer H. Hoffmann, while trying to show some aerobatics over the airfield.

==Rally over Europe==
The second part of the contest was a 5942 km rally over Europe, on a path: Paris - Basil - Genova - Lyon - Marseille - Saint Raphael - Turin - Milan - Venice - Zagreb - Belgrad - Bucharest - Turnu Severin - Budapest - Vienna - Brno -Prague - Wrocław (Breslau) - Warsaw - Poznań - Berlin - Hamburg - Amsterdam - Brussels - Paris. Main waypoints were: Belgrad, Warsaw and Paris. It was not a mere rally, but rather a trial of aircraft capability on such a long path. Important factors were: keeping a good cruise speed, a regularity of flight (covering at least 1 stage daily and spending nights at appointed airfields), and lack of major repairs. Maximum number of points to obtain in a rally was 119 (70 for a cruise speed, 35 for regularity, 14 for reliability).

The rally started on at 9 am on August 7, from Orly airfield in Paris. Two crews dropped out during the start, including the Czech Josef Novak, flying an Aero A.34 whose engine failed and the plane turned over upon crashing. Though maximum speed was not important, most crews tried to make their best, and a group of the nine fastest crews reached Belgrad just at noon on August 8. Among them were: Hubert Broad, Winifred Spooner, František Klepš (Avia BH-11), Johannes Nehring (D-18), Raymond Delmotte (Caudron C.191) and John Carberry (RK-25). This group was in the lead at the next airfields, too. Other groups were five German crews, with Fritz Morzik (BFW M.23b), and two groups of Italians; most other crews flew separately. Some crews dropped out on the way, mostly due to faults and unplanned landings.

On August 9, starting from 9 am, most crews took off from Belgrad, though some crews had not reached this point yet. On August 11, the leading group took off from Brno and reached Warsaw. Flying to Poznań, Johannes Nehring was forced to land and damaged his Darmstadt D-18, one of the contest&#x27;s fastest machines. Some other crews dropped out as well.

Since competitors were not allowed to land in Paris before August 14 at 3 pm, the leading group took off from Brussels and flew over Orly airfield minutes before 3 pm. A few minutes later, just as the jury started work, 19 aircraft landed in Paris. The first to touch the ground was the Italian Batista Botalla flying a Fiat AS.1. On that day, four more crews arrived. On August 15, three crews finished, and on the next day the remaining ones. Only 31 crews out of 47 finished the rally.

Only two crews reached the maximum 119 pts for the rally: the German Fritz Morzik (BFW M.23b) and the Canadian John Carberry (RK-25). The next score was 109 pts for Hubert Broad (DH-60G). Good results, 99-104 pts were obtained by five Italian crews, flying in a group. Winners of the technical trials gained less points for the race, taking further positions (Robert Lusser - 97.75 pts, František Klepš - 94 pts, Hans Wirth - 81.75 pts).

==Results==
After a rally, on August 16 there was a closing ceremony. After counting of points, the first place was given to the German, Fritz Morzik. The second place was taken by Hubert Broad.

The first prize in the Challenge was 100,000 French franc, the 2nd - 50,000 FRF, the 3rd - 25,000 FRF, 16 other crews would get 7,350 FRF.

The contest was a German success, including John Carberry, but only 12 out of 24 German crews finished the contest. Very good result was obtained by the Italian team - 9 out of 12 crews finished, and on good places.

Due to German victory, the next Challenge 1930 was organized in Germany. The new regulations of 1930 put more accent to technical part, demanding more advanced aircraft.

<text>China Records was a record label founded 1 October 1984 by Derek Green. Its top-selling artists were Art of Noise, Morcheeba and the Levellers.

In 1986 and 1987, China Records releases were manufactured and marketed worldwide by Chrysalis Records, and then by Polydor Records in 1988 through 1990. From 1991 the labels UK releases were made and distributed by Pinnacle Records, with material being licensed to various other labels for international release. In February 1992 Derek Green quit the BPI over their stance on the independent chart, whilst the label distribution went major in 1997 when it was acquired by Warner Music Group. With this deal, China was distributed through Discovery Records in the US, and is now being distributed through Sire Records since Discovery folded. Overseas releases are handled primarily by Warner Manufacturing Europe.

<doc id="1002770" wikidata="Q423965" url="?curid=1002770" title="Vestibular schwannoma">
<text>A vestibular schwannoma (VS), also called acoustic neuroma, is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve that passes from the inner ear to the brain. The tumor originates when Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the nerve malfunction. Normally, Schwann cells function beneficially to protect the nerves which transmit balance and sound information to the brain. However, sometimes a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, NF2, located on chromosome 22, results in abnormal production of the cell protein named &quot;Merlin&quot;, and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumor. The tumor originates mostly on the vestibular division of the nerve rather than the cochlear division, but hearing as well as balance will be affected as the tumor enlarges.

The great majority of these VSs (95%) are unilateral, in one ear only. They are called &quot;sporadic&quot; (i.e., by-chance, non-hereditary). Although non-cancerous, they can do harm or even become life-threatening if they grow to press on other cranial nerves and vital structures such as the brainstem. Variations in the mutation determine the nature of the tumor&#x27;s development. The only environmental exposure that has been definitely associated with the growth of a VS is therapeutic radiation exposure to the head.

==Symptoms of Sporadic VS==
Sporadic VSs originate within the confining bony walls of the small (ca. 2 cm long) internal auditory canal. The most common early symptoms of these intracanalicular (IAC) VSs are gradual hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear, some imbalance or dizziness, and tinnitus (ringing or other noise in the ear). Gradual single-sided hearing loss in the high frequencies is the first most obvious symptom for the great majority of patients. Headache as a presenting symptom of VS specifically is rare; facial symptoms (facial numbness, weakness) usually occur only as the tumor grows out of the canal and/or after therapeutic treatment. Delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are not unusual. Initial hearing loss is usually subtle and may be attributed mistakenly to aging, earwax buildup, or perhaps exposure to some loud environmental noise. A sudden hearing loss, which is uncommon, might be misdiagnosed as Ménière&#x27;s disease, an abnormality of the inner ear that also has tinnitus as a symptom. The brain&#x27;s vestibular system usually compensates for early balance problems.

There have been cases of tumors that were actually asymptomatic until very large and at a critical stage. Tumor growth rates are highly variable: some small VSs (perhaps 50%) do not grow at all; some few grow for a time and then shrink; some appear dormant but suddenly grow rapidly. In general, although studies differ, VSs that grow are slow-growing at an average rate of 1.2 to 1.9 mm per year. IAC tumors that grow beyond 1.5 cm in diameter expand into the relatively empty space of the cerebellopontine angle, taking on the characteristic &#x27;ice-cream-cone&#x27; appearance seen on MRIs. As &#x27;space-occupying-lesions,&#x27; the tumors can reach 3 to 4 cm or more in size and infringe on the facial nerve (facial expression) and trigeminal nerve (facial sensation). Advanced hearing loss and spells of true vertigo may occur. Very large tumors are life-threatening when they press on the cerebellum or cause brainstem compression. Late symptoms of very large VS include headache, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, mental confusion and eventually coma.

==Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)==
For the most part, unilateral sporadic vestibular schwannomas are readily treated successfully by modern medical techniques. Having bilateral VSs is a more troublesome condition. Bilateralism is considered to be the hallmark and main diagnostic criterion of Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2), a genetic disorder that is heritable, progressive, difficult to manage, and has a 1 in 2 chance of being passed on to each offspring. NF2 patients tend to have a more severe mutation, although there are mild mosaic cases in which only some cells carry the mutation. Genetic testing confirming mutation of the NF2 gene is recommended. About 50% of people with NF2 have a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation, and about 50% of these new mutations will be mild mosaic cases which are less likely to be passed on. NF2 patients may develop other cranial and spine tumors. NF2 develops during the teens or early adulthood, whereas sporadic VSs are diagnosed mostly in patients between the ages of 40–60 years. Both varieties of VS (sporadic and NF2) are very rare, accounting for only about 8% of all primary brain tumors. The incidence of NF2 is approximately 1 per 60,000 people.

== Tumor sizes ==
Patient surveys in the U.S. by the national Acoustic Neuroma Association (1998, 2007–08, 2012, 2014) showed that the percentage of diagnosed tumors 1.5 cm or less increased significantly from 23% to 47%. Researchers in Denmark reported (2004): &quot;The size of diagnosed tumors has decreased from a median of 35 mm in 1979 to 10 mm in 2001.&quot; In general, tumor size (diameter) is described as small (less than 1.5 cm), medium (1.5 to 2.5 cm), large (2.5 to 4.0 cm) and giant (more than 4.0 cm). (Note: 1 inch = 2.54 cm) Radiologists reporting on MRI scans use the Koos Grading Scale which relates tumor size to its proximity to the brainstem and nearby cranial nerves. Thus Koos grade 1 is a purely intrameatal (IAC) tumor, 1–10 mm in size; Koos grade 2, 10–20 mm, has extended into the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), but with no brainstem contact; Koos grade 3, 20–30 mm, fills the CPA space and touches on the brainstem, but without compression; and Koos grade 4, more than 30 mm in size, compresses the brainstem and nearby nerves, and displaces critical arteries.

==Diagnosis==

Preliminary diagnostic procedures include ear examination, hearing and vestibular testing. Typical symptoms include unilateral tinnitus, progressive hearing loss and vertigo. Usually diagnostic sensitivity is increased with one or more otological symptom. The rate of VS pick up with unilateral tinnitus alone using MRI has been shown to be &lt;0.1%. The auditory brainstem response test (ABR) is a cost-effective test to see if a VS has perhaps compromised the cochlear nerve.

Computed tomography (CT scan) of the head will detect moderate to large sized VS but can miss small sized VS. VS appears as isodense to surrounding brain parenchyma on CT. VS does not have calcifications in it. A large VS may expand the size of internal acoustic meatus (IAC) and may compromise hearing function because the nerves within the IAC are compressed, particularly the cochlear nerve. However, the facial nerve is less commonly affected. The main advantage of a CT scan is to assess the extent of bony involvement by VS. VS enhances when iodinated contrast is given. A contrasted CT scan of the temporal bone can be done if the patient is unable to undergo MRI scan.

MRI scan is the imaging of choice because it can more accurately differentiate the mass from other tumors such as meningioma, facial nerve schwannoma, epidermoid cyst, arachnoid cyst, aneurysm, and brain metastasis. MRI scan also helps in surgical planning and follow-up of the tumor after surgery. VS is usually isointense on T1 weighted images, hyperintense on T2 weighted images, and enhances after given gadolinium contrast.

== Management ==
=== Microsurgery for Sporadic VS ===
The &quot;Guidelines on the Treatment of Adults with Vestibular Schwannoma&quot; issued in 2018 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons in the U.S. looked at the long-term evolution of treatments for VS. The Introduction to the Guidelines stated: &quot;The evolution in treatment over the last century has ultimately led to an environment where functional outcome has taken precedence over disease eradication. With multiple noninvasive management options available, the tolerance of cranial neuropathy in patients with small and medium-sized tumors is low. Today, hearing preservation, facial nerve function, and tumor control remain the primary benchmarks used to evaluate treatment effectiveness and compare outcomes.&quot; In other words, tumor management was able to give greater attention to preserving quality of life.

The three main surgical approaches to the tumor are the translabyrinthine (incision behind the ear to reach the bony labyrinth), the retrosigmoid (incision behind the ear to reach cerebellopontine angle) and the middle cranial fossa (incision in front of the ear to access the IAC from above). Tumor size is a major factor in determining approach selection. Adjunctive use of the endoscope for enhanced visualization during surgery for IAC tumors has gained attention as an emerging technique with advancing technology. For large tumors, a &#x27;facial nerve sparing surgery&#x27; offers partial removals, to be followed (as needed) by stereotactic radiosurgery or radiotherapy for &#x27;residuals&#x27;. The rate of &#x27;tumor control&#x27; appeared to be similar to that for gross total removal surgeries. For small to medium size tumors, the appropriateness of so-called &#x27;hearing preservation surgery&#x27; via either the Middle Fossa or Retrosigmoid approach remained controversial. Data from Denmark indicated that primary observation offered the best chance to preserve good hearing the longest. But preserving good hearing in the affected ear remained an elusive goal. Even during observation, although tumors showed no significant growth, hearing deterioration occurred. Stangerup et al. reported (2010) that most patients with 100% speech discrimination at diagnosis had the best chance of maintaining good hearing after ten years of observation.

The overall mortality rate for VS surgery is around 0.2% - 0.5%. The most common complications include facial nerve disorder (25.0%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (8.5%) and postoperative neurological complications (8.4%).

=== Radiosurgery and radiotherapy ===

The &#x27;Patient Survey&#x27; in the U.S. in 2014 by the national Acoustic Neuroma Association showed that 29% of VS patients reported radiosurgery (17%) or radiotherapy (12%) as their treatment of choice. Radiosurgery is the delivery to the VS of a concentrated high radiation dose in a one-day session, whereas radiotherapy involves multiple treatment sessions where the total radiation dose is spread out in fractions over a few days or 3–4 weeks. The main objective in either case is &#x27;tumor control&#x27; by damaging tumor cell DNA and stopping blood vessel proliferation (angiogenesis) needed for tumor growth.

Tumors may swell following radiation, but this increase in size is transient and does not signal a failed procedure. The average success rate for stereotactic radiosurgery is reported to be 95.5%. Radiation doses are calculated in terms of Gray/Gy—the measure of energy deposited by ionizing radiation per kilogram of matter. Since VSs are noninvasive and well-demarcated from surrounding tissues, radiosurgeons are able to target the tumor volume closely and minimize normal tissue damage. Multisession radiotherapy recommends the advantage of giving time between sessions for biological repair of any damage to normal tissues that may occur, and allows for radiation of the tumor at different times in the cell growth cycle.

The CyberKnife radiation system introduced in 1994 recommends a protocol of three sessions known as hypofractionation. Radiation dosages overall were reduced over the years as experience showed that excellent tumor control rates could be maintained even as dosages were lowered to benefit hearing preservation and facial nerve function. Generally, single-session Gamma Knife radiosurgery is limited in use to VSs less than 3 cm in diameter to avoid possible complications with facial nerves, brainstem and the cochlea apparatus. The risk of radiation-induced secondary tumors is very small, in the range of 0.01-0.02%. The risk for NF2 patients appears to be slightly higher.

=== Medical and gene therapies ===

To date, there is no fully efficacious medical therapy for VS. The complexity of the molecular biology research involved is truly challenging. Clinical trials are in progress for other drugs such as everolimus, lapatinib and mifepristone&quot;.&quot; Common aspirin has been studied as a low-risk therapeutic option, but emerging evidence suggests that aspirin and other NSAID use may not prevent VS tumor growth.

=== Observation of Small VS ===

The 1991 NIH Consensus Statement observed: &quot;There is evidence that some patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma and a subgroup of patients with NF2 may have tumors that fail to progress rapidly, resulting in stable neurologic function for a long time. The use of MRI with contrast enhancement has resulted in the identification of patients with very small, relatively asymptomatic vestibular schwannomas for whom the natural history is unknown. Conservative management may be appropriate for these patients.&quot; At the time, conservative management (i.e., observation, &#x27;wait-and-watch&#x27;/&#x27;wait-and-scan&#x27;) was reserved mainly for elderly or infirm patients.

Data on tumor sizes at diagnosis and tumor growth behavior was sparse or contradictory and mainly short-term. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, established in 1992, only began to keep records for benign tumors like VS in 2004. In 2006, a landmark study from Denmark, entitled &quot;The Natural History of Vestibular Schwannoma,&quot; initiated a significant trend toward observation for managing small VS. Researchers in Copenhagen had the advantage that data for all Danish patients diagnosed with VS since 1976 was entered into a national database. The 2006 study by Stangerup et al. looked at the data for 1,818 patients (1976–2004) comparing intrameatal VS (in the auditory canal) and extrameatal VS (into the cerebellopontine angle). Remarkably, for the 729 patients having observation management via interval MRI scans, tumor growth was observed in only 17% of intrameatal tumors and 29% of extrameatal tumors. The mean observation time was 3.6 years (range 1–15 years). The researchers concluded: &quot;VS growth occurs within the first 5 years after diagnosis in a limited number of tumors, primarily in tumors with an extrameatal extension. These findings justify primary observation of small tumors.&quot; The medical community and VS patients responded positively to these findings.

&#x27;Patient Surveys&#x27; in the U.S. by the national Acoustic Neuroma Association showed an increase in &quot;Wait-and-Watch&quot; from 4% of respondents in 1998 to 20% in 2012. An important study in 2015 entitled &quot;The Changing Landscape of Vestibular Schwannoma Management in the United States – A Shift Toward Conservatism,&quot; predicted that half of all cases of VS would be managed initially with observation by 2026. Stangerup et al. have urged caution (2019): &quot;Most studies show that if tumor growth occurs, it is usually detected within the first few years of diagnosis. However, long-term observational studies are desperately needed to guide the development of evidence-based surveillance algorithms designed to detect late tumor progression.&quot; Also (see Medical and Gene Therapies, above): &quot;Basic science and identification of genes, molecular pathways, and networks related to tumor growth are likely to change our approach to treatment including conservative management.&quot;

==Incidence of Sporadic VS==

In 2015, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio used population-based data of the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the U.S. to calculate an incidence of 10.9 per million of population, or about 3,300 cases of VS per year. A higher incidence up to 29.3 per million of population was found for the 65-74 year-old age group. There was no significant difference in incidence by gender. Incidence was higher in Asian Pacific Islanders, and lower in African Americans and Hispanics. The annual number of diagnosed VS increased significantly worldwide by the early 1990s with the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Notably, epidemiologists in Denmark (population of 5.7 million in 2015) reported 193 cases of VS for 2015—an incidence of 34 per million of population per year. The first MRI scanner in Denmark was functional in 1989, and by 2015 the number increased to approximately 100.

In 1777, Eduard Sandifort of Leiden, the Netherlands, wrote a postmortem first description of a vestibular schwannoma. He observed &quot;a certain hard body adherent to the auditory nerve,&quot; and concluded this cause of deafness was beyond the reach of medication or surgery and was therefore incurable. The Schwann cells that multiply to form a VS on the vestibulocochlear nerve were identified 60 years later in 1838 by the German physiologist Theodor Schwann. In 1895, Thomas Annandale, a general surgeon at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, Scotland, was the first to successfully localize and surgically remove a VS. Finger dissection of VS to &#x27;shell out&#x27; the tumor was typical. The main goal when dealing with large tumors was preservation of life.

=== Early operations ===
In the early 1900s the mortality rate for VS surgery was in the range of 75 to 85%. Surgeons typically delayed invasive intervention as long as possible as a last resort. Harvey Cushing (1869–1939) is known as &#x27;the father of neurosurgery for VS.&#x27; His basic study published in 1917 was entitled &quot;Tumors of the Nervus Acusticus and the Syndrome of the Cerebellopontine Angle.&quot; Cushing perfected the retrosigmoid surgical approach, and by doing suboccipital craniotomy and subtotal removals he was able to reduce mortality to 4% by 1931. Cushing worked at Brigham Hospital in Boston. An equally famous specialist for VS at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore was Walter E. Dandy (1886–1946), a former pupil of Cushing who advocated total tumor removals. In 1931, he reported a complete removal with preservation of the facial nerve.

=== Imaging ===
A major problem for the pioneers in VS neurosurgery was the lack of adequate imaging for spotting small tumors. Treating tumors that grew overly large in the cerebellopontine angle resulted in poor outcomes for the goals of facial nerve and hearing preservation. For imaging, conventional X-rays began to be used in the 1920s and CT scanners were introduced in the 1960s, but all were superseded by &#x27;gold standard&#x27; MRIs in the 1980s. Facial nerve monitoring was added in 1979. William F. House (1923–2012) pioneered the use of the operating microscope, and (with William Hitselberger) popularized the translabyrinthine and middle fossa surgery approaches for VS. The operating microscope would be used in virtually all operations by 1998. House&#x27;s son, John W. House, proposed (1983) and, with Derald E. Brackmann, developed the House-Brackmann grading system for reporting facial nerve outcomes following VS surgery.

=== Treatment ===

==== Surgical treatment ====

In 1986, at a meeting for neurosurgeons in San Francisco, the House group endorsed a guideline for the surgical treatment of VS: &quot;The best opportunity for successful removal of an acoustic neuroma is when it is small: when first diagnosed.&quot; At the time of the NIH Consensus Development Conference for &quot;Acoustic Neuroma&quot; in 1991, microsurgery was definitely the predominant management strategy for VS. The consensus conference&#x27;s panel of experts reported: &quot;Currently, the ideal treatment for symptomatic patients with vestibular schwannoma is the total excision of the tumor in a single stage with minimal morbidity and mortality and with preservation of neurological function.&quot; Total surgical removal was not, however, the only treatment indicated at the time. Partial removal was used to debulk very large VSs threatening to compress vital structures. And long-term observation management was deemed appropriate as MRI scans began to reveal more and more small tumors with stable neurological symptoms.

==== Radiosurgery ====
By the 1980s, radiation therapy was also becoming an attractive option for VS patients. At the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, Lars Leksell (1907–1986) pioneered Gamma Knife radiosurgery. In 1951, he published his landmark scientific paper, &quot;The Stereotaxic Method and Radiosurgery of the Brain,&quot; defining radiosurgery as &quot;the destruction of intracranial targets without opening the skull using very high doses of ionizing radiation in stereotactically directed beams.&quot; The first Gamma Knife machine was operable in Sweden in 1969, and the first Gamma Knife in the U.S. was installed in 1987 at the Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. Departments of radiation oncology at major medical centers began to modify X-ray linear accelerators (linacs) to do single-session radiosurgery and multiple-session radiotherapy. In 1991, the U.S. National Institutes of Health convened a Consensus Development Conference (December 11–13, 1991) for Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma) to evaluate management of the disorder and recommend areas for future activity and research.&quot;

==== Medical and gene therapies ====
The 1991 NIH Consensus Statement recommended attention to &quot;the development of pharmaceutical and other alternative medical treatments, such as tumor suppressing agents.&quot; Ideally, a drug could be found to permanently shrink or eradicate VSs, with minimal side effects. A key step forward in 1993 was the identification of the NF2 gene and its protein product &quot;Merlin&quot;, which modulates the complex molecular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. These pathways that drive VS formation (tumorigenesis) and growth are currently under investigation.

A second important field of study in molecular biology investigates ways to stop the formation (angiogenesis) of the new blood vessels that are needed to support tumor growth by supplying nutrients and oxygen. In 1998, the glycoprotein named VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) that initiates proliferation was discovered. An anti-VEGF drug named bevacizumab (Avastin) was developed and showed promise in stopping this vascular proliferation. Unfortunately, when tested for NF2 tumors, the therapy required prolonged treatment resulting in hypertension and impaired wound healing.

The development of a new generation of drugs may become a secondary therapy in view of advances in genome editing during the 1990s that led to the invention of CRISPR in 2009. CRISPR has become the preferred genome editing tool whereby diseases may be treated by correcting causative mutations directly in a patient&#x27;s genome.

==Notable people==
American actor, director, humanitarian, social activist and film producer Mark Ruffalo was diagnosed with vestibular schwannoma in 2001 which resulted in a period of partial facial paralysis. He recovered from the paralysis; however, he became deaf in his left ear as a result of the tumor.

Guitarist/composer/producer David Torn was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma in 1992. It required intricate surgery that left him deaf in the right ear and burdened by many other health obstacles.

American actress and designer Tara Subkoff was diagnosed with schwannoma in 2009. She successfully underwent surgery, but was left with permanent nerve damage and deafness in her right ear.

Tionne Watkins, better known by her stage name T-Boz, R&amp;B singer from the R&amp;B/hip-hop group TLC, was diagnosed with a strawberry-sized acoustic neuroma on her vestibular nerve in 2006. Many physicians refused to remove the tumor due to her sickle-cell-related complications, leaving her alternatives grim. Ultimately, she underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.

English comedian, artist, surrealist, musician, actor, and television presenter Vic Reeves revealed that he was diagnosed with a grape-sized vestibular schwannoma at age 62. He has lost all hearing in the left ear as a result.

<text>Laugavegur () is a hiking trail in South Iceland. It is the most popular trail in Iceland, with an estimated 75,000-100,000 people hiking it every year. In 2012, National Geographic listed it as one of the twenty best trails in the world.

Laugavegur runs from the hot springs area of Landmannalaugar to the glacial valley of Þórsmörk. It is noted for the wide variety of landscapes on its path: colourful mountains, black lava, bubbling hot springs, lakes, canyons and a black sandy desert. 
The route is typically completed by hikers in four days, north to south, with stops at the mountain huts of Hrafntinnusker, Álftavatn, and Emstrur. At least three rivers must be forded during the walk. It is possible to combine the trek with a hike over the Fimmvörðuháls route from Þórsmörk to Skógar. 

The trail is clearly signposted throughout its length. However, adverse weather conditions such as thick fog or heavy snow can dramatically reduce the visibility. This is particularly relevant for the first two sections of the trail. 

The trail is open from the end of June 25 to mid September, when the huts close.

The Laugavegur Ultramarathon has been held annually on the trail since 1997.

<doc id="1002779" wikidata="Q593181" url="?curid=1002779" title="Azeotropic distillation">
<text>In chemistry, azeotropic distillation is any of a range of techniques used to break an azeotrope in distillation. In chemical engineering, &quot;azeotropic distillation&quot; usually refers to the specific technique of adding another component to generate a new, lower-boiling azeotrope that is heterogeneous (e.g. producing two, immiscible liquid phases), such as the example below with the addition of benzene to water and ethanol. 

This practice of adding an entrainer which forms a separate phase is a specific sub-set of (industrial) azeotropic distillation methods, or combination thereof. In some senses, adding an entrainer is similar to extractive distillation.

== Material separation agent ==
The addition of a material separation agent, such as benzene to an ethanol/water mixture, changes the molecular interactions and eliminates the azeotrope. Added in the liquid phase, the new component can alter the activity coefficient of various compounds in different ways thus altering a mixture&#x27;s relative volatility. Greater deviations from Raoult&#x27;s law make it easier to achieve significant changes in relative volatility with the addition of another component. In azeotropic distillation the volatility of the added component is the same as the mixture, and a new azeotrope is formed with one or more of the components based on differences in polarity. If the material separation agent is selected to form azeotropes with more than one component in the feed then it is referred to as an entrainer. The added entrainer should be recovered by distillation, decantation, or another separation method and returned near the top of the original column.

== Distillation of ethanol/water ==
A common historical example of azeotropic distillation is its use in dehydrating ethanol and water mixtures. For this, a near azeotropic mixture is sent to the final column where azeotropic distillation takes place. Several entrainers can be used for this specific process: benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, isooctane, acetone, and diethyl ether are all options as the mixture. Of these benzene and cyclohexane have been used the most extensively, but since the identification of benzene as a carcinogen, toluene is used instead.
== Pressure-swing distillation ==
Another method, pressure-swing distillation, relies on the fact that an azeotrope is pressure dependent. An azeotrope is not a range of concentrations that cannot be distilled, but the point at which the activity coefficients of the distillates are crossing one another. If the azeotrope can be &quot;jumped over&quot;, distillation can continue, although because the activity coefficients have crossed, the component which is boiling will change. For instance, in a distillation of ethanol and water, water will boil out of the remaining ethanol, rather than the ethanol out of the water as at lower concentrations.

Overall the pressure-swing distillation is a very robust and not so highly sophisticated method compared to multi component distillation or membrane processes, but the energy demand is in general higher. Also the investment cost of the distillation columns is higher, due to the pressure inside the vessels.

== Molecular sieves ==
For low boiling azeotropes distillation may not allow the components to be fully separated, and must make use of separation methods that does not rely on distillation. A common approach involves the use of molecular sieves. The sieves can be subsequently regenerated by dehydration using a vacuum oven.

Ethanol can be dried to 95% ABV by heating 3A molecular sieves such as 3A zeolite.

== Dehydration reactions ==
In organic chemistry, some dehydration reactions are subject to unfavorable but fast equilibria. One example is the formation of dioxolanes from aldehydes:
:RCHO + (CH2OH)2 formula_1 RCH(OCH2)2 + H2O
Such unfavorable reactions proceed when water is removed by azeotropic distillation.

<doc id="1002781" wikidata="Q132342" url="?curid=1002781" title="HMS Black Prince (1861)">
<text>HMS &quot;Black Prince&quot; was the third ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy. She was the world&#x27;s second ocean-going, iron-hulled, armoured warship, following her sister ship, . For a brief period the two s were the most powerful warships in the world, being virtually impregnable to the naval guns of the time. Rapid advances in naval technology left &quot;Black Prince&quot; and her sister obsolete within a short time, however, and she spent more time in reserve and training roles than in first-line service.

&quot;Black Prince&quot; spent her active career with the Channel Fleet and was hulked in 1896, becoming a harbour training ship in Queenstown, Ireland. She was renamed &quot;Emerald&quot; in 1903 and then &quot;Impregnable III&quot; in 1910 when she was assigned to the training establishment in Plymouth. The ship was sold for scrap in 1923.

==Design and description==
HMS &quot;Black Prince&quot; was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships had one 2-cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single propeller. Ten rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engine produced a total of during &quot;Black Prince&quot;″s sea trials in September 1862 and the ship had a maximum speed of under steam alone. The ship carried of coal, enough to steam at .

The ironclads were ship rigged and had a sail area of . &quot;Black Prince&quot; could only do under sail, slower than her sister .

===Armament===
The armament of the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class ships was intended to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.

The solid shot of the 68-pounder gun weighed approximately while the gun itself weighed . The gun had a muzzle velocity of and had a range of at an elevation of 12°. The shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and, at an elevation of 11.25°, a maximum range of . The shell of the 40-pounder breech-loading gun was in diameter and weighed . The gun had a maximum range of at a muzzle velocity of . In 1863–1864 the 40-pounder guns were replaced by a heavier version with the same ballistics. All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells.

&quot;Black Prince&quot; was rearmed during her 1867–1868 refit with twenty-four 7-inch and four rifled muzzle-loading guns. The ship also received four 20-pounder breech-loading guns for use as saluting guns. The shell of the 15-calibre 8-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate armour.

===Armour===
The sides of &quot;Black Prince&quot; were protected by an armour belt of wrought iron, thick, that covered the middle of the ship. The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected, which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable. The armour extended above the waterline and below it. 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck. The armour was backed by of teak.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Black Prince&quot; was ordered on 6 October 1859 from Robert Napier and Sons in Govan, Glasgow, for the price of £377,954. The ship was laid down on 12 October 1859 and launched 27 February 1861. On 10 March, she ran aground in the River Clyde near Greenock whilst being towed from Govan to Greenock. Her completion was delayed by a drydock accident at Greenock while fitting out, which damaged her masts. She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, but was not completed until 12 September 1862. &quot;Black Prince&quot; was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1866, then spent a year as flagship on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867–1868, she became guardship on the Clyde. The routine of that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and &quot;Warrior&quot; towed a large floating drydock from Madeira to Bermuda.

&quot;Black Prince&quot; was again refitted in 1874–1875, gaining a poop deck, and rejoined the Channel Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, second-in-command of the fleet. In 1878 Captain Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh took command and the ship crossed the Atlantic to participate in the installation of a new Governor General of Canada. Upon her return &quot;Black Prince&quot; was placed in reserve at Devonport, and, reclassified as an armoured cruiser, she was reactivated periodically to take part in annual fleet exercises. &quot;Black Prince&quot; was hulked in 1896 as a harbour training ship, stationed at Queenstown, and was renamed &quot;Emerald&quot; in 1903. In 1910 the ship was moved to Plymouth and renamed &quot;Impregnable III&quot; when she was assigned to the training school HMS &quot;Impregnable&quot; before she was sold for scrap on 21 February 1923.

<text>Stanley Elton Hollis VC (21 September 1912 – 8 February 1972) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He had the distinction of receiving the only Victoria Cross awarded for actions on D-Day (6 June 1944).

==Early life==
Stanley Hollis was born in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, England, where he lived and attended the local school until 1926. Then his parents (Edith and Alfred Hollis) moved to Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, where he worked in his father&#x27;s fish and chip shop.

In 1929 he was apprenticed to a Whitby shipping company, to learn to be a Navigation Officer. He made regular voyages to West Africa, but in 1930 fell ill with blackwater fever, which ended his merchant navy career. Returning to North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, he worked as a lorry driver, and married Alice Clixby, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

==Military career==
In 1939 he enlisted in the Territorial Army, part of the British Army, in the 4th Battalion, Green Howards. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was mobilised and transferred to the 6th Battalion, Green Howards, and went to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force in 1940, where he served as the commanding officer&#x27;s despatch rider. He was promoted from lance corporal to sergeant during the evacuation from Dunkirk. He then fought from El Alamein to Tunis as part of the British Eighth Army in the North African Campaign. He was made company sergeant major shortly before the invasion of Sicily in 1943, where he was wounded at the battle of Primosole Bridge.

On D-Day, the 6th Green Howards landed on Gold Beach. As his company moved inland from the beaches after the initial landings, Hollis went with his company commander to investigate two German pillboxes which had been by-passed. He rushed the first, taking all but five of the occupants prisoner; and then dealt with the second, taking 26 prisoners. He next cleared a neighbouring trench. Later that day, he led an unsuccessful attack on an enemy position containing a field gun and multiple MG 42 machine guns. After withdrawing, he learned that two of his men had been left behind. He said to his commanding officer, Major Lofthouse, &quot;I took them in. I will try to get them out.&quot; Details below in the citation for his VC.

In September 1944 he was wounded in the leg and evacuated to England, where he was decorated by King George VI on 10 October 1944.

===Citation===

The citation published in the London Gazette read:
==Later life==
After the war, he worked for a time as a sandblaster in a local steelworks. He then became a partner in a motor repair business in Darlington, before becoming a ship&#x27;s engineer from 1950 to 1955. He next trained as a publican, and ran the &#x27;Albion&#x27; public house in Market Square, North Ormesby: the pub&#x27;s name was changed to &#x27;The Green Howard&#x27;. After the pub was demolished in 1970, he moved to become the tenant of the &#x27;Holywell View&#x27; public house at Liverton Mines near Loftus.

He died on 8 February 1972, and was laid to rest in Acklam Cemetery, Middlesbrough.

==Legacy==

Hollis Crescent, a military accommodation estate, was named after him in the 1980s/90s in Strensall, North Yorkshire. A memorial plaque was put on the side of number 2 Hollis Crescent to commemorate his Victoria Cross.
A statue honouring him, sculpted by Brian Alabaster ARBS, was unveiled on 26 November 2015 by Vice Lord Lieutenant of North Yorkshire, Peter Scrope. The walk-in memorial is located close to the Middlesbrough cenotaph outside the gates of Albert Park in front of the Dorman Museum.

Another statue of Stanley Hollis was erected in Crépon, Normandy, France near the Green Howard Pub.
Hollis Court, a retired/sheltered accommodation complex in Coulby Newham, Middlesbrough, is named after him.
His Victoria Cross was bought by medal collector Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, chairman of Racal and Vodafone. Harrison presented the medal to the Green Howards Regimental Museum in Richmond, North Yorkshire in 1997. Ten years later, he purchased, for the Green Howards, the Normandy hut which Hollis had attacked.

In 2016, a school in Middlesbrough that converted to academy status, was named Hollis Academy in his honour.

<doc id="1002787" wikidata="Q180639" url="?curid=1002787" title="Patrice Motsepe">
<text>Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe (born 28 January 1962) is a South African billionaire businessman and football administrator. Patrice Motsepe was born to 
Kgosi Augustine Motsepe, a chief of the Mmakau branch of the Tswana people. Since March 2021, he has been president of the Confederation of African Football. He is the founder and executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, which has interests in gold, ferrous metals, base metals, and platinum. He sits on several company boards, including being the non-executive chairman of Harmony Gold, the world&#x27;s 12th largest gold mining company, and the deputy chairman of Sanlam. He serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum.

In 2003, he became the owner of football club Mamelodi Sundowns.

In 2013, he joined The Giving Pledge, committing to give half of his wealth to charitable causes.

In January 2024, Motsepe was named Africa&#x27;s 9th richest man and South Africa&#x27;s 3rd richest man after Johan Rupert and Nicky Oppenheimer by CNBC Africa alongside Koos Bekker, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion.

In May 2024, Motsepe was ranked as the 1,175th-wealthiest person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;, with a reported fortune of US$2.9 billion.

==Early life and education==
Patrice Motsepe was born to 
Kgosi Augustine Motsepe, a chief of the Mmakau branch of the Tswana people, who had previously been a schoolteacher and who was later a small businessman as the owner of a Spaza shop which was popular with mine workers. It was from this shop that Motsepe learned basic business principles from his father, as well as first-hand exposure to mining.

He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Swaziland and a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand. He specialised in mining and business law.

==Career==
In 1994, he became the first black partner in the law firm Bowman Gilfillan—the same year that Nelson Mandela was elected as the country&#x27;s first black president. While the new government began promoting black empowerment and entrepreneurship; Motsepe founded Future Mining, which provided contract mining services that included the cleaning of gold dust from inside mine shafts for the Vaal Reefs Gold mine, and implemented a system of worker remuneration that combined a low base salary with a profit-sharing bonus.

===Mining===
In 1997, with gold prices at a low, he purchased marginal gold mines from AngloGold under favourable finance terms. AngloGold sold Motsepe six gold mine shafts for $7.7 million allowing him to repay the debt out of the future earnings of the company now known as African Rainbow Minerals.

This was repeated in a string of deals and Motsepe set up a firm to begin buying the operating mines that would become the source of his wealth. In 1999, he teamed up with two of his associates to form Greene and Partners Investments.

The Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) laws introduced after the 1994 elections have been instrumental in cementing Motsepe&#x27;s position in the mining industry in South Africa. A business must have a minimum of 26% black ownership to be considered for a mining license.

Since 2004, Motsepe has been a non-executive director of Absa Group and Sanlam.

In 2002, when it was listed on the JSE Security Exchange, African Rainbow Minerals joined with Harmony Gold Mining Ltd. and the company&#x27;s name changed to ARMgold. Motsepe is also the founder of African Rainbow Minerals Platinum (Proprietary) Limited and ARM Consortium Limited, which later equally split ownership with Anglo American Platinum Corp Ltd. From 2005, Motsepe was Chairman of Teal Exploration and Mining Incorporated. Motsepe is also chairman of Ubuntu-Botho Investments, Non-Executive chairman of Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd. and deputy Chairman of Sanlam Ltd. Motsepe has been president of South Africa&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

===Finance===
In 2003, Motsepe created Ubuntu-Botho Investments (UBI) (and in 2019 he owned 55% of it). In 2004 UBI entered into a BEE deal with insurance and financial services company Sanlam. That deal ended in 2014 when the debt had been paid and UBI acquired 13.5% of Sanlam, but UBI has a 18.1% voting stake in Sanlam as its BEE partner. UBI then started African Rainbow Capital (ARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of UBI. ARC&#x27;s joint chief executive is Johan van Zyl, former executive of Sanlam. ARC has holdings in more than 40 companies, including TymeBank, industrial group Afrimat, agricultural company BKB, telecommunications company Rain, luxury property estate Val de Vie, and a minority stake in Alexander Forbes, the pension fund administrator.

===Renewable energy investments===
In 2024, Motsepe extended his investment portfolio to include the renewable energy sector, addressing South Africa’s energy shortages. He supported the establishment of GoSolr, a company specializing in renting solar panels and batteries to residential customers. GoSolr, a collaboration between African Rainbow Capital Investments Ltd. (a branch of Motsepe&#x27;s Ubuntu-Botho Investments) and Standard Bank Group Ltd., has pledged to invest 10 billion Rands (approximately $537 million) to enhance its solar generation capacity. Initially capable of producing 70 megawatts, the company plans to expand its capacity to about 500 megawatts over a four-year period.

===Sport===
Motsepe is the owner of Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. a Premier soccer league club. In November 2019, Motsepe bought a 37% stake in the Blue Bulls Co. The other major shareholders are Remgro (37%) and Blue Bulls Rugby Union (26%).

In November 2020, Motsepe announced that he would become a candidate to become CAF&#x27;s president. Quickly accused of being actively supported by FIFA - despite its duty of reserve and neutrality - and its President Gianni Infantino, who would seek to obtain the votes of Africa for future re-election, Motsepe was elected on 12 March 2021, after that all four other candidates had withdrawn their candidacies. His son Thlopie Motsepe took over as Mamelodi Sundowns new chairman after he became a new president of CAF.

===Advocacy===
In 2011, he was named the interim chairman of the Black Business Council, and is a founding member and former president of one of South Africa&#x27;s most influential business advocacy and lobby group Business Unity SA (BUSA).

== Recognition ==

Motsepe won South Africa&#x27;s Best Entrepreneur Award in 2002.
In 2004, he was voted 39th among the South African Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Great South Africans. In 2008, he was reported as the 503rd-richest person in the world, according to the &quot;Forbes&quot; 2019 list of The World&#x27;s Billionaires, then ranked as the 962nd-wealthiest person in the world, and the third-wealthiest South African for 2019.

In 2017, on its 100th anniversary edition, Forbes Magazine honored Motsepe as one of the “100 Greatest Living Business Minds” in the world.

In 2020, Motsepe was ranked as the 1,307th-wealthiest person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;, with a reported fortune of US$2.1 billion.

== Controversy ==

In January 2020, at a World Economic Forum dinner in Davos, Patrice Motsepe publicly told the US Former President Donald Trump that &quot;Africa loves him.&quot; Faced with the indignant reactions that this statement provoked throughout the African continent, the billionaire apologised, explaining &quot;I do not have the right to speak on behalf of anybody except myself.&quot;

==Personal life==
Motsepe is married to Dr. Precious Moloi, a physician and fashion entrepreneur. They have three children. He is the brother of Tshepo Motsepe and Bridgette Radebe, and the brother-in-law of both President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister Jeff Radebe.
