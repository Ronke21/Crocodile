<text>The music of Saint Lucia is home to many vibrant oral and folk traditions and is based on elements derived from the music of Africa, especially rhythmically, and Western Europe, dances like the quadrille, polka and waltz. The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, especially a four-stringed banjo called the . Celebratory songs called show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the . Music is an integral part of Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia, and the country&#x27;s popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.

Music education has long been a part of Lucian public education in the primary school age groups. More recently, it has been introduced to older students, many of whom now participate in String Orchestras, wind ensembles, steelpan bands and other musical enrichment opportunities. There is also a well-known government assisted non-profit music school, the Saint Lucia School of Music. The Ministry of Education sponsors a variety of festivals and other special events. The island is also home to the prestigious Saint Lucia Jazz Festival and the Creole celebration .

== Folk music ==

A typical Saint Lucian folk band is based around the fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and (a rattle). The banjo and cuatro are regarded as particularly important in Saint Lucian culture, especially the small, four-stringed , or . Saint Lucian dances include , and (a derivative of the minuet); however, the is increasingly viewed as a national symbol. It is a highly stylized and formalized dance that derives from the European quadrille. is a more informal form of Lucian folk music, and is performed at dances, wakes and other social events; performers improvise comedic and often biting or lyrics. Music also plays a role in the La Rose and La Marguerite tradition of two rival societies that compete in celebration and form a fundamental part of Lucian culture.

&quot;Jwé&quot; (&quot;play&quot;) is a form of rural Lucian folk music associated with beach parties, wakes, &quot;débòt&quot; dances and full moon gatherings. &quot;Jwé&quot; is performed as an informal, social event that provide the chance for Lucians to show off their verbal skills, and communicate their comedic, social and political commentaries without offending people. &quot;Jwé&quot; includes both songs for men and women, both of which can be singers, though most Lucian folk instrumentalists are male. A &quot;jwé&quot; performance is considered good if the audience participates enthusiastically by clapping, responding to the leader and singing and dancing. Some Lucians avoid &quot;jwé&quot; altogether because of its sexually raunchy lyricism and atmosphere; nevertheless, elements of &quot;jwé&quot; have entered mainstream Lucian culture, such as the use of &quot;lang dévivé&quot;, or &quot;saying the opposite of what is meant&quot;.

Musical elements of &quot;jwé&quot; include &quot;gém&quot; (&quot;game song&quot;), &quot;listwa&quot; (storytelling), &quot;jwé chanté&quot; (sung songs) and &quot;jwé dansé&quot; (&quot;song-play-dance&quot;). These forms are united by their use of the Creole language, their use of call-and-response singing between a leader and a chorus, with the exception of &quot;listwa&quot;, and the use of improvisation. &quot;Jwé chanté&quot; and &quot;listwa&quot; are purely vocal styles with no accompaniment, nor any traditional dance; the other two are typically accompanied by a &quot;ka&quot; drum or sometimes the &quot;tibwa&quot; percussion sticks, which provides a rhythm for dancers.

Sung &quot;jwé&quot;, &quot;jwé chanté&quot; or &quot;chanté kont&quot;, is mostly part of the funeral wake tradition. A &quot;jwé chanté&quot; leader uses pantomime to enact scenes from a story, or sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The &quot;gém&quot; (&quot;game song&quot;) are based around a leader who uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. &quot;Jwé dansé&quot; includes four traditional dances. The &quot;solo&quot; is a couple dance, and the &quot;débòt&quot;, &quot;yonbòt&quot; and &quot;jwé pòté&quot; are all circle dances. The &quot;blòtjé&quot; is a musical movement found in all &quot;jwé dansé&quot; styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the &quot;débòt&quot; dance.

=== &quot;Kwadril&quot; ===
&quot;Quadrille&quot; is a Lucian Creole folk dance derived from the European quadrille. It is performed primarily at private parties which are organized by a host in a private home or rented hall, with musicians paid by the host. &quot;Kwadrils&quot; are held throughout the year, except during Lent. The modern &quot;kwadril&quot; has declined in popularity; it had come to be seen as a symbol of colonialism around the time of independence, and was shunned as old-fashioned and out-of-date. More recently, some aspects of Lucian society have come to promote the &quot;quadrille&quot; as a symbol of Lucian culture.
&quot;Quadrilles&quot; are unlike other Lucian dances in that they must be memorized and choreographed, with only slight room for personal interpretation and improvisation. Learners act as a sort of apprentice for more established performers. A successful performance brings respect and prestige for all participants who dance the correct steps which are traditionally said to &quot;demonstrate control over behavior, manner, and skills&quot; and &quot;symbolize... a set of special values linked with a higher social class&quot;.

&quot;Kwadril&quot; music is provided by an ensemble consisting of a four-stringed instrument, the cuatro (instrument), a rattle, the &quot;chakchak&quot;, bones called &quot;zo&quot;, a violin, banjo (, &quot;bwa pòyé&quot;), mandolin and guitar. A kwadril consists of five separate dances: the &quot;pwémyé fidji&quot;, &quot;dézyèm fidji&quot;, &quot;twazyèm fidji&quot;, &quot;katwiyèm fidji&quot; (also &quot;avantwa&quot; or ) and &quot;gwan won&quot; (also &quot;grande rond&quot;). The musicians may also use a &quot;lakonmèt&quot; (mazurka), schottische or polka; the &quot;lakonmèt&quot;, also called the &quot;mazouk&quot;, is especially popular and is the only closed couple dance which originated in Saint Lucia.

=== La Rose and La Marguerite ===
La Rose and La Marguerite are rival societies that commemorate the Anglo-French heritage of the island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies date back to the early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seated chorus with a leader, the &quot;chantwèl&quot;, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the (tambourine), &quot;baha&quot; (wooden trumpet), (rattles), guitar and (scraper).

The celebrations of both groups differ in that La Rose, the &quot;English&quot; faction, is characterized by noisiness, movement, participation, rhythm and exuberance, while La Marguerite, the &quot;French&quot; faction, is characterized by melody, discipline and restraint. There is a vibrant tradition of women singing factional songs related to this rivalry. Traditions common to both factions include the &quot;Omans&quot;, a sort of waltz, Marches and the duple rhythm (or ) dance. and are also performed by La Rose.

=== Other traditional styles ===

In addition to &quot;jwé&quot; and other music performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia is also home to styles used only for specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two traditions are nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year&#x27;s Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a &quot;tanbou tenbal&quot;, &quot;chakchak&quot; and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called &quot;séwinal&quot; in Lucian Creole.

The most widespread form of Lucian work song is the &quot;chanté siay&quot;, which accompanies the sawing of wood. The vocals are performed by a lead singer and two responding singers, accompanied by a &quot;ka&quot; and &quot;tibwa&quot; duo. Both instruments are played in an atypical manner. The &quot;ka&quot; drum is played on the ground rather than upright, and the &quot;tibwa&quot; percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than the rim of a drum.

Lucian drinking songs are the &quot;chanté abwè&quot;, which are rarely performed in recent years. Their traditional context, however, is the &quot;wibòt&quot; celebration, held during Christmas time. &quot;Chanté abwè&quot; are performed in a game in which the singers, seated at a long table, take turns singing a new song each time their turn comes. Those who lasted the entire evening won prizes, often a bottle of rum.

===&quot;Bèlè&quot;===
The &quot;bélè&quot; tradition is a form of Creole song and couple dance, performed one couple with a leader and chorus. They are performed in several contexts, most notably in funeral wakes. &quot;Bélè&quot; include the &quot;bélè anlè&quot;, &quot;bélè matjé&quot;, &quot;bélè anlawis&quot; and the &quot;bélè atè&quot;. The &quot;bélè anlawis&quot; is the only form which is not responsorial.

==== Funeral music ====

On Saint Lucia, wakes are held on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in contrast to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed both inside and outside of the deceased&#x27;s house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and &quot;sankeys&quot; (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called &quot;kont&quot;. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the &quot;débòt&quot; and &quot;bélè&quot;, accompanied &quot;zo&quot; or &quot;tibwa&quot; and &quot;ka&quot;.

The villages of La Grace, Piaye and Laborie in the southwest area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song-dance called the &quot;koutoumba&quot;. The &quot;koutoumba&quot; was only performed for the death of a &quot;djiné&quot;, a person descended from Africans who came to the island in the middle of the 19th century. The &quot;koutoumba&quot; is unique among Lucian folk dance in that it is performed by a sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text, which is evocative of the song&#x27;s atmosphere rather than narrative. The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986.

==== &quot;Kélé&quot; ====
&quot;Kélé&quot; is an Afro-Lucian religious tradition from the Djiné people of the Babonneau region. Only one family, from Resina, in modern Saint Lucia claims to have the religious authority to perform and pass on the &quot;kélé&quot; rituals. &quot;Kélé&quot; is based around three deities, Eshu, Shango and Ogun, and is similar to the Nigerian &quot;Ogun&quot; festival. &quot;Kélé&#x27;s&quot; rituals involve contacting one&#x27;s ancestors to ask for protection, especially &quot;good crops, good health, and good fortune&quot;. &quot;Kélé&quot; has been underground for much of its history, and was only accepted by the Lucian Roman Catholic Church in the early 1960s.

&quot;Kélé&quot; rituals are accompanied by the drumming of the &quot;tanbou manman&quot; (&quot;mother drum&quot;) and the &quot;tanbou ich&quot; (&quot;child drum&quot;), which play four different rhythms at specified moments; these are the &quot;adan&quot;, &quot;èrè&quot;, &quot;koudou&quot; and &quot;kèré&quot; rhythms. Kélé rituals also include singing and dance, as well as feasting, praying to Ogun and the other gods, the smashing of the calabash to appease Eshu at the end of the ceremony, the display of tools made of iron and steel to honor Ogun, and smooth stones to represent Shango, who also receives a ceremonially cleansed sacrificial ram.

== Popular music ==

Lucian popular music can be traced back to the 1940s, when calypso became a part of the island&#x27;s musical culture. Calypso is a lyrical Trinidadian genre, related to several styles found through the Antillean music area. Music scholar Jocelyne Guilbault has called calypso the primary way modern Lucians &quot;express social commentary&quot;. Along with calypso, Lucia has also imported the Trinidadian steelband and soca traditions.

Some Lucian calypsonians recorded in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island&#x27;s small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played an increasing number of programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.

Modern Saint Lucia has produced a few popular musicians in various styles, but is most closely associated with calypso music. Popular Lucian musicians include Tru Tones, Rameau Poleon, Prolifik, Disturbing Joan and Aimran Simmons. Marie Selipha Sesenne Descartes (known simply as &quot;Sesenne&quot;) was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her work as a &quot;chantwelle&quot; and in the promotion of Saint Lucian traditional culture and music. Saint Lucian folk dance and theater includes flower dances, masquerades and the &quot;Papa Djab&quot; festival; various kinds of music are associated with these celebrations.

=== Roots revival ===
In 1969, three Saint Lucians (Eric Brandford, Primrose Bledman and Charles Cadet) collected numerous folk songs for a presentation at the 1969 Expo in Grenada and then again at Guyana&#x27;s 1973 Carifesta. Two major folk groups emerged; they were The Helenites (led by Clement Springer) and Joyce Auguste&#x27;s The Hewanorra Voices. Auguste later introduced folk music into Saint Lucian music education. By the end of the 1980s, music and other aspects of Lucian culture was an integral part of the Lucian education system.

In the time leading up to independence from the United Kingdom in 1979, Saint Lucia underwent a profound political and cultural awakening and roots revival which drew on the rise of the black consciousness movement of the United States, the influence of the Caribbean Ecumenical Consultation for Development on local culture and the loosening of restrictions from the powerful Roman Catholic Church on non-Christian cultural elements. Since 1973, the non-government organization Folk Research Centre which seeks to &quot;promote research into St. Lucian culture&quot; and to &quot;explore and clarify the role of culture in the development of our people&quot;.

===Bouyon soca===

Bouyon soca typically blends old bouyon music rhythms from the 90s&#x27; and soca music. In recent years Bouyon soca has become popular in the island of Saint Lucia. Saint Lucian artist Ricky T released a song &quot;Pressure boom&quot; in 2007 which blended the two genres and became very popular throughout the English speaking Caribbean.

This style of bouyon is mostly, but not exclusively, produced in Saint Lucia.

== Government and industry ==
The government has seen value in promoting a music industry, and has formed the Cultural Development Foundation (CDF) the statutory body given responsibility for preservation and promotion of Saint Lucian culture and arts, to accomplish this goal. In 1979, the first-ever M&amp;C Fine Arts Awards were given by Minvielle &amp; Chastanet Ltd, to Saint Lucian artists as an Independence Gift to the Nation; in the early 2000s, this event was handed over to the newly formed Cultural Development Foundation and is now run as the National Arts Festival. The Folk Research Centre has been a prominent part of Lucian cultural research since 1973, and has also published the journal &quot;Lucian Kaiso&quot;, devoted to Lucian calypso, since 1990. The island&#x27;s calypso traditions are also celebrated at the annual (a ), held since 1987. The island&#x27;s music industry remains little-known internationally and of small economic importance. The government of Saint Lucia has worked with the OECS to promote the regional music industry through intellectual property law and sponsoring festivals and other activities.

The most important festival in modern Lucian culture is the &quot;Jounen Kwéyòl&quot; (&quot;International Creole Day&quot;) held annually on October 28 since 1983. The &quot;Jounen Kwéyòl&quot; is sponsored by the &quot;Bannzil Kwéyòl&quot;, an international organization. Lucian activities are run by the Folk Research Centre in conjunction with the National Research and Development Foundation and the &quot;Mouvman Kwéyòl Sent Lisi&quot; (&quot;St. Lucia Creole Movement&quot;). Lucian law protects the owners of intellectual property, such as songwriters, through the Copyright Act of 1995; copyrights are administered by the Hewanorra Musical Society.

There is also a Saint Lucia Jazz Festival that is a major attraction, and a well-known part of the local music scene. It has been an annual event for fifteen years, and has hosted a variety of jazz stars, in addition to local talent. The 2005 festival was a boost for the local music industry, netting $46 million. The Festival is sponsored by a number of corporations and groups, perhaps most significantly BET.

== Education ==
Music is a part of the curriculum at public schools in Saint Lucia; it has long been taught in younger grade levels, but was only introduced to secondary education in 1999. Primary education on Saint Lucia, music and other artistic education is commonly used incidentally to teaching other subjects or for special occasions. About 40% of the island&#x27;s schools engage in general music education, while others spent more time on general group singing or choir, or recorder ensemble performance. In 2003, a string program was instituted for primary students.

About 70% of schools teach music at the lower secondary level. Many of the schools that do not normally instruct in music may offer volunteer clubs or other more informal opportunities for musical enrichment. Many Lucian schools have formed ensembles, most commonly a wind ensemble (30% of schools), or a steelpan band (20%) or combo group (20%). The public education field has also collaborated with the Saint Lucia School of Music to form the National Youth Choir, String Orchestra and Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble. The governmental Ministry of Education also sponsors a number of festivals and musical special events, both for the benefit of all students and the enrichment of the musically-gifted among them.

The Saint Lucia School of Music is an independent institute of music education that has two branches on the island, one in the north and one in the south. It was established in 1987, and has a student body of around four hundred students. The School&#x27;s professed goal is to provide music education at all levels, to offer community opportunities for musical enrichment, to facilitate the training and professional development of educators, and to establish the school as a musical resource. There is also a notable music Education Centre operated by a vocal group from the fishing village Anse la Raye; this Centre provides music education opportunities for gifted and underprivileged children from across the island.

<text>Steve Punt (born ) is a British comedy writer, comedian and actor. Along with Hugh Dennis, he is part of the double act Punt and Dennis and was presenter of BBC Radio 4 satirical news programme &quot;The Now Show&quot;. He is also a writer and programme associate for various television panel game shows, including &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; and &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, and is a writer for fellow comedians such as Rory Bremner and Jasper Carrott.

==Early life==
Punt wanted to be an author as a child, but knew he would never make a living out of it, so turned to comedy. Punt was educated at Whitgift School and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read English. While at Cambridge, he joined Footlights, where he first met comedy partner Hugh Dennis and was vice-president from 1983 to 1985 with Nick Hancock as president. He was in the writing team for three revues in a row.

==Career==

While at university Punt began writing for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Week Ending&quot;. Punt and Dennis later became resident guest comedians on shows presented by Jasper Carrott, including &quot;Canned Carrott&quot;, with Punt contributing in the writing team as well.

In 1988 Punt and Dennis worked with fellow former Footlights member David Baddiel and his comedy partner Rob Newman to write and perform a satirical sketch and stand-up show called &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; on BBC Radio 1. After three years, the show transferred to television. Punt and Dennis went on to perform in their own TV sketch show, &quot;The Imaginatively Titled Punt &amp; Dennis Show&quot;, and co-wrote and starred with Nick Hancock in the sitcom &quot;Me, You and Him&quot;.

Punt performed with Dennis in &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Bad Week&quot; for BBC Radio 2. The pair were also the main presenters and writers of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Now Show&quot; and the writers of Radio 4 sitcom &quot;The Party Line&quot;. Punt, with Mark Tavener, is co-writer of the 2007 Radio 4 series &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. He also, with the help of Hugh Dennis, Jon Holmes, Marcus Brigstocke and Mitch Benn wrote &quot;The Now Show Book of World Records&quot;, a follow-up book for &quot;The Now Show&quot;.

In 2008 Punt wrote the script for and performed in &quot;Rockford&#x27;s Rock Opera&quot;, a critically acclaimed ecological musical story created with school friend, Matthew Sweetapple, which has been published as an audiobook.

2008 also saw the first episode of &quot;Punt PI&quot;, a fact-based comedy radio series on BBC Radio 4 in which Punt investigates mysteries in Britain. The show continued occasionally until 2017, racking up 10 series.

In 2011, Punt became the presenter of Radio 4 quiz show &quot;The 3rd Degree&quot;. Punt played Eric Idle in the BBC adaptation &quot;Holy Flying Circus&quot;, covering the controversy surrounding the release of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;.

On 3 January 2013 Punt appeared on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;. His specialist subject was Tony Hancock and his chosen supported charity was The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (Sands). Punt won the contest.

During 2016 Punt toured with the production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in the role of the narrator.

<text>The National Museum of Afghanistan (, &quot;Mūzīyam-e mellī-ye Afghānestān&quot;; , &quot;Də Afghānistān Millī Mūzīyəm&quot;) is located across the street from the Darul Aman Palace in the Darulaman area of Kabul, Afghanistan. It was once considered to be one of the world&#x27;s finest museums. There have been reports about expanding the museum or building a new larger one. Mohammad Zubair Abedi serves as the current director of the museum.

The museum&#x27;s collection had earlier been one of the most important in Central Asia, with over 100,000 items dating back several millennia, including items from Persian, Buddhist, and Islamic dynasties. 

With the start of the civil war in 1992, the museum was looted numerous times and destroyed by rockets, resulting in a loss of 70% of the 100,000 objects on display. 

Since 2007, a number of international organizations have helped to recover over 8,000 artifacts, the most recent being a limestone sculpture from Germany. 

Approximately 843 artifacts were returned by the United Kingdom in 2012, including the famous 1st Century Begram ivories.

==History==

The Afghan National Museum was opened in 1919 during the reign of King Amanullah Khan.

The collection was originally inside the Bagh-e Bala Palace, but was moved in 1922 and began as a &#x27;Cabinet of Curiosities&#x27;. It was moved to its present location in 1931. Historian Nancy Dupree co-authored &quot;A Guide to the Kabul Museum&quot; in 1964. In 1973, a Danish architect was hired to design a new building for the museum, but the plans were never carried out. In 1989, the Bactrian Gold had been moved to an underground vault at the Central Bank of Afghanistan.
After the collapse of President Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s government and the start of a civil war in the early 1990s, the museum was looted numerous times, resulting in the loss of 70% of the 100,000 objects which were then on display. A rocket attack in May 1993 buried ancient potteries under debris. 

In March 1994, the museum, which had been used as a military base, was struck by rocket fire and largely destroyed. The Ministry of Information and Culture during President Burhanuddin Rabbani&#x27;s government ordered that the 71 museum staff begin moving the inventory to Kabul Hotel (now Kabul Serena Hotel) in order to rescue them from further rocketing and shelling. 

In September 1996, staff at the museum completed the cataloging of the remaining materials. In February and March 2001, the Taliban destroyed countless pieces of art due to religious reasons. It was reported in November 2001 that the Taliban had destroyed at least 2,750 ancient works of art during the year.
Between 2003 and 2006, about $350,000 was spent to refurbish the building. Many of the most precious objects had been sealed in metal boxes and removed for safety and were recovered and inventoried in 2004. 

Some archeological objects were found in vaults in Kabul, while a collection was also discovered in Switzerland. 

Since 2007, UNESCO and Interpol have helped to recover over 8,000 artefacts, the most recent being a limestone sculpture from Germany and 843 artefacts returned by the British Museum in July 2012, including the famous 1st Century Begram Ivories.

In 2013, the Mobile Museum Project was started by the museum in cooperation with the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago which brought 3D replicas of artefacts from the Kabul museum to schools across Afghanistan from 2013 to 2016. A number of new facilities were also added to the museum during that period.

After the 2021 Taliban offensive and Fall of Kabul, Mohammad Fahim Rahimi, the director of the museum since 2016, vowed to stay on as director and preserve its collection, as concern grew about a possible repeat of the destruction of a fraction of the collection by the Taliban in the 1990s. As of March 2023, Mohammad Zubair Abedi is the acting director of the museum.

==Collections==

Many treasures of ivory are stored in the museum, including antiquities from Kushan Empire and early Islam eras. One of the most famous pieces known to have survived the turbulent period in the 1990s is the Rabatak Inscription of King Kanishka.

===Archaeological materials===
The museum has been the repository for many of the most spectacular archaeological finds in the country. 

These include:

* the painted frescos from Dilberjin; 
* inscriptions, fragments of architecture, sculpture, metal objects, and coins rescued from the French excavations at Ai-Khanoum and Surkh Kotal;
* the spectacular collection of objects found at a merchants warehouse in the city of Bagram, which include ivories from India, mirrors from China, and glassware from the Roman Empire; 
* the stucco heads of Hadda; 
* Buddhist sculpture from Tepe Sardar and other monastic institutions in Afghanistan;
* a large collection of Islamic art from the Ghaznavids and Timurids periods found at Ghazni.

===Numismatic collection===
The museum has a large collection of coins, the Austrian numismatist Robert Göbl reported it contained 30,000 objects during a UNESCO sponsored audit of the collection. The collection contains the bulk of archaeological material recovered in Afghanistan. It has not been published, but individual hoards and archaeological sites have been. The French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA) published the coin finds made at the town of Surkh Kotal. Some of the coins found at the excavation of Begram have been published. Part of the Mir Zakah hoard, a very unusual deposit containing enormous numbers of coins from the fourth century BC to third century AD, totalling silver and copper coins were kept in the museum. Part of the hoard was published by DAFA. The museum has appointed a curator for Numismatics but the collection remains closed to scholars and the general public.

===The travelling collection===
Certain important parts of the collection, including material from Bagram, Ai-Khanoum, Tepe Fullol, and the gold jewellery from all six of the excavated burials at Tillya Tepe, have been on traveling exhibition since 2006. They have been exhibited at the Guimet Museum in France, four museums in the United States, four art galleries in Australia, the Canadian Museum of History, the Bonn Museum in Germany, and most recently to the British Museum. They continue to tour and will eventually return to the Afghan National Museum.

<text>Michael Paul Fleischer is a United States businessman from the state of New Jersey.

==Career==
On March 13, 2004 Fleischer was appointed to the post of Director of Private Sector Development for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. He had been a deputy in the Office of Private Sector Development since November 2003.

He took leave from Bogen Communications International, Inc., where he was president and a member of the Board of Directors, to serve in Iraq. He has since returned to Bogen. He is the brother of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. 

===Criticism in Iraq===
The Private Sector Development run by Fleischer came under criticism by many military and civilian analysts for removing Iraqi government subsidies to state owned businesses. This, it was argued, threw thousands out of work thereby giving the insurgency a disaffected pool of recruits. In the area under British control the subsidies were continued.

In an article printed in the New York Review of Books Peter W. Galbraith, a former US Ambassador to Croatia commented on the policy of not supporting Iraqi state-owned enterprises; &#x27;The privatizing of Iraq&#x27;s economy was handled at first by Thomas C. Foley, a top Bush fund-raiser, and then by Michael Fleisher, brother of President Bush&#x27;s first press secretary. ...he told the Chicago-Tribune...that the Americans were going to teach the Iraqis a new way of doing business. &quot;The only paradigm they know is cronyism.&quot;&#x27;

<doc id="987191" wikidata="Q6942256" url="?curid=987191" title="Music of Saint Kitts and Nevis">
<text>The music of Saint Kitts and Nevis is known for a number of musical celebrations including Carnival (December 17 to January 3 on Saint Kitts). The last week in June features the St Kitts Music Festival, while the week-long Culturama on Nevis lasts from the end of July into early August. 

In addition, there are other festivals on the island of Saint Kitts. There is Inner City Fest in February in Molineaux Green Valley Festival usually around Whit Monday in the village of Cayon, Easterama around Easter (April) in the village of Sandy Point, Fest-Tab, around July-August in the village of Tabernacle, and La festival de Capisterre, around Independence Day in Saint Kitts and Nevis (19 September), in the Capisterre region. These celebrations typically feature parades, street dances and salsa, jazz, soca, calypso and steelpan music.

The official genre of St. Kitts and Nevis is called Wilders / Wailaz / Jamband Music. It has a similarity to Soca Music (which originated in Trinidad and Tobago) but it is distinctly different in sound and origin. This music can be heard from the local bands which play on both islands during SugarMas, Culturama and other local activities.

==Traditional music==

The most well-known kind of traditional music is probably seasonal Christmas songs, though there also chanteys and other songs. Music is also a part of the Tea Meetings which are common on the island, featuring a pair of stentorian male singers in a competitive kind of performance in which hecklers play an important role.

==Carnival music==

Carnival in Saint Kitts and Nevis features music quite prominently. Big Drum and string bands accompany folk performers. Other instruments include shack-shack (a tin can with beads inside), baha (a blown metal pipe), triangle, fife, guitar and quarto.

Iron bands were introduced to Saint Kitts and Nevis&#x27; Carnival in the 1940s, when bands used makeshift percussion instruments from the likes of car rims. Ensembles of local, collaborative musicians formed during this era, playing drums, saxophones, bass guitars and trumpets; these included the Silver Rhythm Orchestra, Brown Queen, Music Makers, Esperanza and Rhythm Kings. The following decade saw the introduction a Trinidadian style called steelpan, brought by Lloyd Matheson, C.B.E., then an Education Officer. The first steelpan band was Roy Martin&#x27;s Wilberforce Steel Pan. Other bands included the Eagle Squadron, Boomerang, Casablanca, Boston Tigers and The Invaders. Modern Carnival in Saint Kitts and Nevis did not begin until the late 1950s. In the 1960s, brass bands dominated first Carnival, then much of popular music.

== Calypso ==
Calypso is a style of music from Trinidad and Tobago, consisting of highly lyrical songs that frequently makes topical comments on the ruling classes and social issues of the day. 
During slavery, calypso was used for commentary against the oppression and brutal treatment suffered by the slaves at the hands of their masters. This form was called Caiso (Ka-ee-sow) meaning &quot;the town cry&quot;, while the singer/composer was called the &quot;Caisonian&quot;. This singing was then nicknamed &quot;calypso&quot; by the European slave masters, who called it after the mythological sea nymph &quot;calypso&quot; because of its melodic ability to captivate its listeners.

The caisonians were then pressured by their masters to sing songs to entertain them in return for certain privileges and an ease of tasks, and for money during the post-emancipation period.

Calypso was subsequently commercialized in Trinidad, where it was sung mainly for entertainment in shows called &quot;calypso tents&quot; during the Trinidad carnival celebrations. (Unreferenced)

From Trinidad, calypso spread across the Caribbean, and became a major part of Kittitian (or Kittian) and Nevisian music with the introduction of formal calypso competitions in the 1950s. Prominent early calypsonians from this period included Mighty Kush, Lord Mike, Elmo Osborne, Lord Harmony, King Monow and the Mighty Saint. By the 1980s, calypso had begun to peak in popularity on Saint Kitts and Nevis, while the two dominant performers were the rivals Starshield and Ellie Matt  (King Richie and son King &#x27;Richie Buntin&#x27;.who today are one of the most prolific songwriter and composers.

<text>Claudia Wells is an American actress and businesswoman, best known for her role as Jennifer Parker in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.

==Early life==
Wells was born on July 5, 1966 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Her family moved to the San Francisco Bay area when she was seven weeks old. She went to Marin Country Day School and French-American Bilingual School. As of 2014, some of her family still lived in that area. Wells moved to Los Angeles at the age of 14, later graduating from Beverly Hills High School. She has a brother.

== Career ==
Wells appeared in ten operas between ages eight and twelve. She began acting in TV shows in the late 1970s.

Wells played Jennifer Parker, Marty McFly&#x27;s girlfriend, in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. She almost did not end up in the first film of the successful franchise. According to Wells, she had been cast, but a pilot she had done for ABC had been picked up, and she was contractually forced to drop out of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. During that time, Eric Stoltz had been shooting for five weeks in the role of Marty McFly. The producers halted filming and replaced Stoltz with Michael J. Fox. By then, Wells&#x27;s pilot had been finished and she was recast as Jennifer, now shooting alongside Fox, having never filmed a frame with Stoltz.

That same year (1985), Wells co-starred in &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration, featuring several famous musicians, actors and athletes. The following year, she appeared in the TV movie &quot;Babies Having Babies&quot;, and the short-lived series &quot;Fast Times&quot;, a TV adaptation of the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (Wells played Linda Barrett, portrayed by Phoebe Cates in the film). Following &quot;Fast Times&quot;, she did not appear again on-screen until the 1996 independent film, &quot;Still Waters Burn&quot; (released on DVD February 12, 2008).

===Leaving acting===
After her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, Wells put her career on hold for family reasons, and told the studio she would not be available to reprise her &quot;Back to the Future&quot; role for the two sequels. Actress Elisabeth Shue replaced her. Her mother subsequently died in October 1994.

On December 19, 1991, Wells founded a Studio City, Los Angeles-based clothing store, Armani Wells, which she still owns and manages as of 2024.
===Return to acting===
After a lengthy absence, Wells returned to acting in 2011 with a small role in the independent science-fiction film, &quot;Alien Armageddon&quot;.

The same year, Wells reprised her role from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, 26 years after her last appearance in the series, provided the voice of Jennifer Parker for &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot;. In 2012, Wells announced that her next project would be a horror film titled &quot;Room &amp; Board&quot;.

== Personal life ==
When she was 15, she became a born-again Christian and her faith helped her get through her mother&#x27;s cancer diagnosis and death.

Wells has a son named Sebastian, born around 1995.

<text>HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, and the second ship to bear the name. She was built by Adrian Hayes at Deptford Dockyard and launched on 8 December 1757. She was active during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Service history==

Her first commander was Captain Peircy Brett (later Commodore Brett) and she had a complement of 550 crew. Under Brett on 5 June 1758 she was part of the major British raid on St Malo (totalling around 50 ships).

&quot;Norfolk&quot; emulated her predecessor () by reinforcing the West Indies, where she escorted a fleet that was transporting vital stores and six infantry regiments to that region.

In September 1758 command passed to Captain Robert Hughes and under Hughes in January 1759 a successful attack was made on Guadeloupe.

In September 1760 under Captain Richard Kempenfelt, she was part of the Siege of Pondicherry (1760).

On 10 February 1761 she took part in the capture of Mahe. On 24 September 1762 she was part of the Battle of Manila.

She became flagship of the Commander-In-Chief East Indies Station, Rear-Admiral and his successor Vice-Admiral Samuel Cornish. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was decommissioned in 1764, after her return to Portsmouth was broken up in 1774.

<text>In the classification of programming languages, an applicative programming language is built out of functions applied to arguments. Applicative languages are functional, and applicative is often used as a synonym for functional. However, concatenative languages can be functional, while not being applicative.

The semantics of applicative languages are based on beta reduction of terms, and Side effect such as mutation of state are not permitted.

Lisp and ML are applicative programming languages.

<doc id="987201" wikidata="Q2618578" url="?curid=987201" title="Dobhar-chú">
<text>The Dobhar-chú (; ), or King Otter, is a creature of Irish and Scottish folklore. It resembles both a dog and an otter, though it sometimes is described as half dog, half fish. It lives in water and has fur with protective properties. There are little to no written records of the Dobhar-Chú since its legend has relied heavily on oral storytelling and tradition.

==Description==
Physical description of the Dobhar-Chú resembles an otter but said to be about five times as large , with a white pelt, black ear tips, and a black cross shape on its back. Though, due to the murky waters it is said to reside in, its pelt may be portrayed as darker.

=== Etymology ===
 is one of the two most common Irish words for &#x27;otter&#x27;. The modern Irish word for &#x27;water&#x27; is &quot;uisce&quot; (see whiskey), although &quot;dobhar&quot; is also used in placenames. &quot;Dobhar&quot; is a much older form and cognates are found in other Celtic languages (e.g. Welsh &quot;dŵr&quot; or &quot;dwfr,&quot; Cornish &quot;Dowrgi&quot; &#x27;waterhound/otter&#x27; ). &quot;Cú&quot; is &#x27;hound&#x27; in Irish (see for example &quot;Cúchulainn&quot;, &#x27;Culainn&#x27;s hound&#x27;). The Dobhar-chú is also known as the &quot;dobarcu&quot;, and anglicised as &quot;doyarchu&quot;, &quot;dhuragoo&quot;, &quot;dorraghow&quot; or &quot;anchu&quot;.

=== Headstone ===
A headstone, found in Conwall cemetery in Glenade, County Leitrim, depicts the &quot;Dobhar-chú&quot; and is related to a tale of an attack on a local woman by the creature. The stone is claimed to be the headstone of a grave of a woman killed by the Dobhar-chú in the 18th century.

The monument is a recumbent flag of sandstone, which is about in size. It depicts a recumbent animal having body and legs like those of a dog with the characteristic depth of rib and strength of thigh. The tail, long and curved, shows a definite tuft. The rear of the haunch, and still more the tail, are in exceptionally low relief, apparently due to the loss of a thin flake from the face of the slab. So far the description is canine. The lettering, and carving are in relief.

=== Legend ===
In 1722, Grace McGloighlin, locally known as Grace Connolly (her maiden name), lived in the townland of Creevelea at the north-west corner of Glenade Lough. One morning she went down to the lough [lake] to wash some clothes. Some accounts say that her husband, Terrence, rushed to the shore after hearing her scream whilst others say that he went down after she failed to return that evening. Both accounts say Mr. McGloighlin rushed down only to find her mutilated body with the Dobhar-Chú sleeping on top of her. Terrence runs home and grabs a dagger before returning to kill the Dobhar-Chú. As the beast died it let out a whistling yell to its mate, who soon rose from the lough. The second beast chased him from the lough, and after a long and bloody battle, which some accounts say he did not face alone, he killed the second Dobhar-Chú.

<doc id="987206" wikidata="Q5633535" url="?curid=987206" title="HMS Norfolk (1693)">
<text>HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; was an 80-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was built at Southampton and launched on 28 March 1693, and was the first ship to bear the name. She was rebuilt at Plymouth according to the 1719 Establishment, and was re-launched on 21 September 1728. Instead of carrying her armament on two decks as she had done originally, she now carried them on three gundecks, though she continued to be rated a third rate.

She gained her first battle honour at Vélez-Málaga in 1704. The ship conducted a number of important duties throughout her long career. She was then employed in the role of Plymouth guardship, before being attached to the Mediterranean Fleet and then to the West Indies, as reinforcement for that region, as well as performing as flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir John Balchen.

The &quot;Norfolk&quot; was rebuilt at Plymouth Dockyard from 1718 to 1728 to the dimensions of the 1719 Establishment. She was not fitted out until 1731, when she was recommissioned under Captain John Roberta. Her final action was near France in 1744. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was renamed &quot;Princess Amelia&quot; in 1755, two years after the previous &quot;Princess Amelia&quot; had been broken up. She herself was broken up in 1757.

<text>The province of Vicenza (; ) is a province in the Veneto region of Italy. Its capital city is Vicenza.

The province has an area of 2,722.53 km2, and a total population of 865,082 (as of 2017). There are 113 &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) in the province. Towns in the province include Bassano del Grappa, Schio, Arzignano, Montecchio Maggiore, Thiene, Torri di Quartesolo, Noventa Vicentina, Marostica, Lonigo and Valdagno.
Population is unevenly spread throughout the province. More than 60% of the populace resides in densely industrialised areas in the eastern, western, and northern (known as Alto Vicentino) conurbations, as well as the area surrounding Bassano del Grappa. The remaining 40% reside in predominantly rural areas in the southern part of the province (the Colli Berici and Basso Vicentino) or the Asiago plateau.

Economic development in some areas is hindered by industrial and agricultural depression. Towns in the western section such as Valdagno and Montecchio Maggiore suffer from high unemployment, following a decline in steel and textile industries. The Colli Berici and Basso Vicentino remain overwhelmingly agricultural and present high levels of unemployment. The heavily industrial Alto Vicentino area alone accounts for half of the province&#x27;s GDP.

Federico Faggin, an Italian physicist/electrical engineer principally responsible for the design of the first microprocessor, was born in Vicenza.

==Economy==
The industrial sector plays a primary role and over the last half century has supplanted the predominant agricultural sector: since the second post-war period, the province has in fact been one of the major interpreters of the remarkable economic and industrial development of the Northeast of Italy. The most important economic activities in the province are textile, tanning, marble extraction, ceramics, furniture, but above all jewelry.

Small and medium-sized enterprises predominate on the territory, making the province of Vicenza one of the most important on a national level, and which have developed, giving rise to mainly 4 industrial districts:

* The leather district in the Chiampo Valley, in Arzignano, Chiampo, Montorso Vicentino, Zermeghedo and Montebello Vicentino,
* The wool and yarn district in the towns of Schio and Valdagno (historically linked to the two large local industries, Lanerossi and Marzotto respectively)
* The goldsmith district in Vicenza, Trissino and Camisano Vicentino
* The electronics district in Vicenza

Other activities typically linked to the territory are:

* The distilleries in Bassano del Grappa, considered the world capital of grappa
* The furniture factories in Bassano del Grappa
* The production of ceramics in Nove and Vicenza

==Quality of life==
According to the European Environment Agency, in 2023 it was the 362nd most polluted city in Europe (out of a sample of 375 cities) and the third in Italy, after the provinces of Cremona and Padua.

<text>The Battle of Beaver Dams took place on 24 June 1813, during the War of 1812. A column of troops from the United States Army marched from Fort George and attempted to surprise a British outpost at Beaver Dams, billeting themselves overnight in the village of Queenston, Ontario. Laura Secord, a resident of Queenston, had earlier learned of the American plans from several Americans billeted at her house and had struck out on a long and difficult trek to warn the British at Decou&#x27;s stone house near present-day Brock University. When the Americans resumed their march, they were ambushed by Kahnawake and other native warriors and eventually surrendered to a small British detachment led by Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. About 500 U.S. troops, including their wounded commander, were taken prisoner.

==Background==
On 25 May 1813, the United States had won the Battle of Fort George, capturing the fort. The British fell back to a position at Burlington Heights near the western end of Lake Ontario, briefly abandoning the entire Niagara Peninsula to the invading force. The Americans attempted to pursue the British, but their advance was checked at the Battle of Stoney Creek by a British counter-attack. At the same time, the flotilla of warships of the United States Navy which had been supporting their army on the Niagara Peninsula was hastily withdrawn to face a threat to their own base, and a British flotilla threatened the American line of communications. The Americans fell back to Fort George. The British followed up and established an outpost at DeCou&#x27;s house in the present-day city of Thorold, Ontario, from which natives and militia harassed the U.S. outposts.

The U.S. Army commander at Fort George, Brigadier General John Parker Boyd, decided to clear the threat posed by enemy raiders and to restore his men&#x27;s morale by making a surprise attack on the outpost at DeCou&#x27;s.

==U.S. plan==
The force assigned to the attack was led by the recently promoted Colonel Charles Boerstler of the 14th U.S. Infantry and consisted of Boerstler&#x27;s own 14th U.S. Regiment of Infantry, with detachments of the 6th, 13th and 23rd U.S. Regiments of Infantry, a company of artillery with one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder field guns, and twenty U.S. Dragoons. An irregular corps of forty mounted volunteers from the New York Militia under Cyrenius Chapin led the way. The force was accompanied by two large supply wagons. At dusk on 23 June, Boerstler&#x27;s force moved in secret from Fort George to the village of Queenston, where they quartered themselves in the houses and other buildings.
Several American officers had earlier billeted themselves in the house of Canadian Militia Captain James Secord, who had been severely wounded the previous year at the Battle of Queenston Heights. His wife, Laura Secord, overheard the officers discussing their scheme. Very early on 22 June, she set out to warn the British at DeCou&#x27;s house, walking about through the woods until she came upon a native encampment on the Twelve Mile Creek. The warriors took her to Lieutenant James FitzGibbon, who commanded the British outpost. The information she conveyed to FitzGibbon confirmed what natives had reported since they first observed the U.S. column near St. David&#x27;s.

==Battle==
The main contingent of natives were 300 Kahnawake, also referred to as &quot;Caughnawaga&quot; in contemporary accounts, Mohawk people who had earlier been converted to Christianity by Jesuit missionaries. They were nominally commanded by Captain Dominique Ducharme of the Indian Department, with Lieutenants Isaac LeClair and J.B. de Lorimier. There were also 100 Mohawks under Captain William Johnson Kerr. They set up ambushes in a thickly wooded area east of Beaver Dams. FitzGibbon with 46 men of the 49th Regiment of Foot was in reserve.
Early on 24 June, U.S. forces set out for DeCou&#x27;s stone house. At St. David&#x27;s they proceeded along a trail at the base of the escarpment until they reached another trail leading up the &quot;mountain&quot;. Reaching the top, they became aware of natives closing in on their flanks and rear, but Boerstler did not change his plans. When the natives opened fire, Boerstler was wounded and placed in one of the wagons. According to U.S. accounts, they caused the Mohawks to flee and fought their way out of the woods into open fields where they could use their artillery, and the natives were not at such an advantage. This account is not supported by other witnesses.

At this point, FitzGibbon intervened. Addressing Boerstler under a flag of truce, he claimed that the Americans were outnumbered and surrounded, and that if they did not surrender he would be unable to restrain the natives from slaughtering them. The wounded Boerstler capitulated to Major de Haren of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry, who had just arrived on the field with another detachment of British regulars (mainly from the 104th Regiment) from Twelve Mile Creek.

The U.S. force surrendered in a field just south of the Thorold Tunnel, east of the present-day Welland Canal. The prisoners were escorted first to DeCou&#x27;s, then to the British base at Ball&#x27;s Falls..

==Casualties==
The natives admitted to a total of five chiefs and warriors killed, and 20 wounded, although Ducharme stated that 15 were killed and 25 wounded.

The U.S. casualty report stated 25 killed and 50 wounded; all of the wounded being among the prisoners, who numbered 23 officers and 489 enlisted men. It was later claimed that many of the wounded U.S. troops were killed by Mohawks.

==Results==
The loss of Boerstler&#x27;s detachment demoralized the U.S. force at Fort George. From then until they abandoned the fort on 10 December, they rarely dared send any patrols more than a mile from the fort. To reinforce their fear of the Native people, there was another minor disaster on 8 July when a party from the 8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment and Merritt&#x27;s Troop of Provincial Dragoons, accompanied by Ottawas under Captain Matthew Elliott and other Indigenous warriors under Mohawk chief John Norton, went to retrieve a chest of medicines which had been hastily buried at Ball&#x27;s Farm near Two Mile Creek when the British had evacuated Fort George in May. A party from the 13th U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Joseph Eldridge attempted to pursue the British detachment but was ambushed at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Farm, losing 28 men, several of whom were scalped despite the efforts of officers of the Indian Department to prevent it.

==Legends and folk tales==
Referring to the respective parts played by the various Native Americans and the British, local legend (perhaps started by Mohawk leader John Norton, who was present) had it that, &quot;The Caughnawaga got the victory, the Mohawks got the plunder and FitzGibbon got the credit&quot;.

In 1818, FitzGibbon made a report to Captain Kerr which read in part:
With respect to the affair with Captain Boerstler, not a shot was fired on our side by any but the Indians. They beat the American detachment into a state of terror, and the only share I claim is taking advantage of a favorable moment to offer them protection from the tomahawk and scalping knife. The Indian Department did the rest.

Captain Ducharme claimed that he himself did not demand the U.S. surrender because as a French Canadian by birth who had spent most of his life among the Indians, he spoke no English.

===Laura Secord===
Much later, in 1827, FitzGibbon wrote:
I do hereby Certify that on the 22d. day of June 1813, Mrs. Secord, Wife of James Secord, Esqr. then of St. David&#x27;s, came to me at the Beaver Dam after Sun Set, having come from her house at St. David&#x27;s by a circuitous route a distance of twelve miles, and informed me that her Husband had learnt from an American officer the preceding night that a Detachment from the American Army then in Fort George would be sent out on the following morning (the 23d.) for the purpose of Surprising and capturing a Detachment of the 49th Regt. then at Beaver Dam under my Command. In Consequence of this information, I placed the Indians under Norton together with my own Detachment in a Situation to intercept the American Detachment and we occupied it during the night of the 22d. – but the Enemy did not come until the morning of the 24th when his Detachment was captured. Colonel Boerstler, their commander, in a conversation with me confirmed fully the information communicated to me by Mrs. Secord and accounted for the attempt not having been made on the 23rd. as at first intended.

By this account, Laura Secord learned of the U.S. plans and made her exit from St. David&#x27;s (near Queenston) on June 22, before the main body of U.S. troops had set out from Fort George.

==National Historic Site==
Beaver Dams represents one of the earliest attempts to create a national historical park. In 1914, a convention of Ontario historical and patriotic groups resolved to ask the Department of the Interior &quot;to develop a 40-acre site near Thorold as a national battlefield park commemorating the Battle of Beaver Dams.&quot;

Although Beaver Dams was not made a national park, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board was created in 1919 to develop a heritage policy at the federal level for historic sites. In 1921, soon after the Board&#x27;s formation, the Board recommended the designation of the Battle of Beaver Dams site as a National Historic Site, one of its earliest selections.

A monument commemorating the battle was dedicated in 1923 and situated on the original site of the event (near the southeast corner of the intersection of Davis Road and Old Thorold Stone Road, approximately southeast of present-day Thorold), where it was located for several decades. In 1976, this monument (as well as one marking the site where in 1876, during construction of the 3rd Welland Canal, the remains of 16 U.S. soldiers from the battle were uncovered) was subsequently relocated several kilometres to the west when the Battle of Beaverdams [sic] Park was opened and there was talk of constructing a 5th Welland Canal near the battlefield. The original site of the battlefield was unmarked from 1976 until 2013, the Battle of Beaverdams Committee discussed marking the site with a &quot;historic boulder&quot; for the bicentennial and this was achieved on June 23, 2013.

Related to the National Historic Site, the Laura Secord Legacy Trail was dedicated in June 2013, recreating the route of her journey from her homestead in Queenston to DeCew House in Thorold, where she delivered her message to Lt. Fitzgibbon on June 22, 1813. The trail is divided into five stages and encompasses ancient forested Indian trails and modern city sidewalks. The trail is linked to the Trans-Canada Trail and is 32 kilometers.

<doc id="987220" wikidata="Q6942195" url="?curid=987220" title="Music of Montserrat">
<text>The music of Montserrat is influenced by Irish traditions, noticeable in the set dance-like Bam-chick-lay, and the presence of fife and drum ensembles similar to the bodhrán. Natives are also witness to the jumbie dance, the style of which is still strongly African. Instruments include the ukulele and shak-shak, an African instrument made from a calabash gourd; both of these are used in traditional string bands. Calypso and spiritual-influenced vocal choirs, like the Emerald Isle Community Singers, are popular.

Past pop stars include the soca bandleader Alphonsus &quot;Arrow&quot; Cassell, known for 1983&#x27;s &quot;Hot! Hot! Hot!&quot;. Calypso music is also popular, as are the vocal choirs Voices and the Emerald Community Singers are well known throughout the island. They perform at various special occasions, such as the December Festival, and throughout the year. The most famous modern string band from Montserrat is the Rude Boys String Band.

Montserratian culture is generally a hybrid of African and European, specifically British and Irish, elements. The African influence is the most pronounced, and manifests itself in the local Creole language, as well as the island&#x27;s folktales, stories, songs, dances and religion. Montserrat remained largely isolated from international popular culture until the 1960s, and the island&#x27;s folk traditions remained vibrant until the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano in 1995, after which most of the population left the island. The popularity of Arrow also contributed to the demise of traditional music, replaced largely by imported popular styles.

== Folk music ==

Montserrat&#x27;s folk musical heritage includes a wide array of religious and ritual folk music. There are also folk songs used in spiritual musical traditions, in addition to secular use; indeed, there is little distinction between secular and spiritual aspects of traditional Montserratian culture. Folk songs are generally in the Montserrat Creole language and concern topics ranging from obeah (&quot;magic&quot;) to agriculture, infidelity and historic occurrences. Many songs are widespread and well-known, and occur in numerous variations, including &quot;Nincom Riley&quot; and &quot;All de Relief&quot;, two of the most famous Montserratian folk songs. The folk repertoire also include calypsos and Irish melodies. The Irish Montserratian tradition has largely died out, with the last performer, George Allen, a fiddler, dying in 1966.

=== Jumbie ===

The jumbie dance has been called the &quot;purest manifestation of folk religion on Montserrat&quot;, and is an iconic part of folk culture, bringing together local folklore, dance, song and music. It has also been described as a startling and unique hybrid, consisting of &quot;Western instruments (that) produce Africanesque music, to which dancers perform Irish steps while moving their upper bodies like Africans&quot;.

The jumbie dance was probably last performed in 1980. Jumbies are traditionally said to be spirits, one of several kinds that also include the African &quot;sukra&quot; and &quot;jabless&quot;, and the Irish mermaid, animal spirit (similar to the &quot;Púca&quot;) and the Jack Lantern. Jumbies hold a similar place in Montserratian society as fairies does in Irish culture; they are the recipients of many small offerings, such as bits of food or drink, and the subject of numerous daily superstitions and rituals.

The jumbie dance is performed by four couples, one man and one woman. They each do a series of sets, consisting of five quadrilles played at successively swifter tempos. The couples will switch out as they get tired, until eventually one becomes possessed by a jumbie. They often move about wildly, fall to the floor and shout in glossolalia.

Some Montserratian Irish trace the origins of the jumbie dance to the pre-emancipation period, when slaves attempted to perform the dances performed by white overseers and landowners. Jumbie dances are traditionally performed after a celebration, in the home of a sponsor, and to mark times of individual crisis or major life changes, such as a wedding or christening. 
The jumbie dance is said to induce spiritual possession and grant divination skills. Often, jumbie dances are intended to cure diseases, remove curses or discover the identity of a guilty party.

There are generally three jumbie dancers in a unit, who perform accompanied by the &quot;babala&quot; (tambourine, or &quot;jumbie drum&quot;), triangle, fife or &quot;pulley&quot; (accordion, concertina or melodeon), and most importantly the French reel (also &quot;jumbie drum&quot; or &quot;woowoo&quot;), a skin drum that produces an ominous sound which is said to attract the jumbie spirits. Both the &quot;babala&quot; and &quot;French reel&quot; are similar to the Irish bodhran in construction; all three drums are played with the fingertips, palms and the backs of the hands.

=== Other folk traditions ===

The same music used in the jumbie dance also accompanies &quot;country dance&quot;s (also known as &quot;goatskin&quot; or &quot;drum dance&quot;). Country dances are strictly recreational, however, and use different songs and dances than the jumbie dance. Rum shops are frequently home to string bands, especially on Boxing Day, and ensembles of guitar, banjo, accordion and &quot;cuatro&quot; (ukulele).

The Montserratian tradition of masquerading is both a ritual and celebratory element of folk music. Groups of dancers (&quot;masqueraders&quot;) with bright costumes and voluminous adornments, including whips (&quot;hunters&quot;) that are used for the Masqueraders to move crowds away as they parade the streets, scare away evil spirits and send signals to other dancers. Masqueraders travel door to door and receive small gifts, while dancing a standard set of dances consisting of a heel-and-toe polka and five quadrilles. This celebration begins in mid-December and ends January 1.

Montserrat is also home to a string band folk tradition that provides accompaniment to many kinds of songs and dances. These generally include the ukulele (, imported from Hawaiian music), guitar, triangle, the bass boom pipe, shak-shak, and fife. String bands traditionally performed for weddings; this tradition declined with the rise of stereos and recorded music, as well as the spread of jazz bands, but was revived in the 1970s. String bands now also play at hotels and nightclubs.

== Popular music and modern styles ==

The steel band tradition is common to many Caribbean, and especially Lesser Antillean, islands. The Montserratian tradition began in 1949 in Ryner&#x27;s Village and Kinsale, and was prominent enough by the following year to be played at the Empire Day celebrations. Despite some criticism that the music was degrading for children, steel bands have become a major part of the island&#x27;s musical heritage.

Calypso is an originally Trinidadian style of music that has since spread across the world. In recent years it has become a major part of Montserratian music, with the rise of Alphonsus &quot;Arrow&quot; Cassell, a soca artist who is internationally renowned. Calypso in Montserrat dates to the 1950s, and Justin &quot;Hero&quot; Cassell (Arrow&#x27;s brother), who won the islands calypso competition thirteen times and became the Calypso King of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. In 2000, Sylvina &quot;Khandie&quot; Malone became the first female calypso monarch on Montserrat. A popular song on local radio is &quot;Sailing Away Again&quot; by local writer and singer Eloise Lynch. Her main focus is Lovers Rock but this song has always been a popular favorite on the island. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z84Zc_YHnps
== Holidays and festivals ==

The Montserrat December Festival (the local Carnival tradition) is the biggest holiday of the year, held all through the month of December concluding on January 1 and ending with a street parade. The Festival is like Carnival on the other Caribbean islands, featuring competitions in various skills, especially the Calypso King competition, street dancing (&quot;jamming&quot; or &quot;jumping up&quot;), Soca King, beauty pageants and masquerade performances. There are also Christmas songs and caroling.

December Festival parades formerly included music and masqueraders, and dancers in uniforms modeled on the Grenadier Guards. Music is provided by an ensemble of triangle, fife and two goatskin, deep-barreled drums called &quot;kettles&quot; or &quot;booms&quot;). This tradition is primarily African in style, with little Irish or British influence, and is very distinct from jumbie dance styles. The traditional music of the December Festival was last performed in 1988, in St. John&#x27;s Village.

Boxing Day is an occasion for music competitions, held in Sturge Park. Steelbands, village groups, masquerade ensembles and mummers all perform. Jump-up Day commemorates and celebrates emancipation from slavery, and is accompanied by steelbands, masquerades and dancing men carrying chains to symbolize the bondage of slavery.

Music is also an important part of St Patrick&#x27;s Day, which is a celebration of Montserrat&#x27;s Irish heritage and music and has now been transformed into a whole week of activities.

== Music for Montserrat ==

AIR Studios, a recording studio operated by George Martin, used to be on the island, and performers like the Rolling Stones, Sting and Elton John traveled there to record. After Hurricane Hugo, however, the studios were closed. Martin organized a fundraiser (&quot;Music for Montserrat&quot;) for the island in 1997, which included native band Arrow, Mark Knopfler, Jimmy Buffett, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Carl Perkins (who died the next year), Sting and Elton John. Other local bands performed simultaneously at Gerald&#x27;s Bottom on the island; the occasion also saw the reformation of Climax Blues Band and the appearance of Bankie Banks.

<doc id="987221" wikidata="Q3304253" url="?curid=987221" title="Hurricane Luis">
<text>Hurricane Luis was a long lived and powerful tropical cyclone that was the strongest hurricane to make landfall and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm, along with Humberto, Iris, and Karen, was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the Atlantic basin.

The system formed from a tropical wave, south of Cape Verde islands west of Africa, on August 28, and attained tropical storm status on August 29. The storm reached hurricane status on August 31 and later developed into a Category 4 hurricane. Luis affected the Leeward Islands at this strength from September 4 to September 6. By the time Luis made landfall on Newfoundland, it had weakened down to a Category 1 hurricane and then became extratropical on September 11.

Luis caused extensive damage to Antigua, St. Barthelemy, the island of St. Martin and Anguilla as it affected Bermuda. The storm accounted for 19 confirmed deaths, left nearly 20,000 homeless (mostly in Anguilla, Barbuda, and St. Martin), and affected more than 70,000 people. Total damage was estimated at $3.3 billion (1995 USD) across the affected areas.

Earlier Category 4 storms that impacted the Leeward Islands in the 20th century include Hurricane Dog in 1950, Hurricane David in 1979, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Guadeloupe in a short period; Hurricane Iris had hit a week before, and Hurricane Marilyn only 10 days after. After Hurricane Luis, the Leeward Islands were struck the following years by numerous hurricanes: Hurricane Bertha and Hortense in 1996, Erika in 1997, Georges in 1998, Jose and Lenny in 1999, and Debby in 2000.

==Meteorological history==
On August 26, 1995, an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave emerged over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, between the western coast of Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. A low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak surface low on August 27, and at around 1200 UTC on August 27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen. 36 hours later, on August 29, the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Luis. Although convective activity fluctuated over the next two days as the result of a nearby wind shear, the storm continued to intensify as pressure rose. When the wind shear relented, an eye began to form, and the system attained hurricane status on August 31. It was classified as a Category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later.
As it tracked north-northwestward, Hurricane Luis continued to strengthen, and became a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale on September 2. As it turned further westward, the cyclone maintained a rectilinear slow motion, and the intensity was confirmed by a reconnaissance flight on September 3. At the time of the flight, Luis was located approximately east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm began to accelerate slightly as it moved along a subtropical ridge, due to the absorption of Tropical Storm Karen by the stronger Iris.

By the time that it approached the Lesser Antilles on September 4, Luis had sustained a wind field measuring from in diameter. On the morning of September 5, the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe, which experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of Grande-Terre and La Désirade, had been relatively spared by the storm. The eyewall of the hurricane, however, skimmed Antigua and directly passed over Barbuda as it slowly weakened. During this time, the storm proceeded slowly northwestward, causing moderate damage to Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. Later, Luis moved along St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, and ultimately crossed Anguilla, where the most powerful winds within the eyewall were estimated to have reached , and its central pressure had dropped from .

Luis maintained its Category 4 intensity until September 7, when it was situated approximately north of Puerto Rico. After seven consecutive days as a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least beginning on September 1, the storm gradually re-curved over the northern Atlantic as a Category 2 hurricane, its wind speed dropping to . On September 9, the center of the storm passed to the west of Bermuda, causing minor damage. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast, ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis. On the afternoon of September 10, Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at an unusually high latitude. The NHC reported that the central pressure of the storm decreased to , and sustained winds did not exceed .

Luis maintained this intensity until September 11, when it reached the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland, where cold, dry air became entrenched in its circulation, and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900 UTC on September 11, 1995. The hurricane sped at nearly to the northeast before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remains persisted for 30 more hours over the North Atlantic Ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September 12.

==Preparations==

Three days before passing over the northern Lesser Antilles, Luis became a Category 4 hurricane and was forecasted to avoid areas well to the north, following the path set by Humberto and Karen. However, as Karen neared Iris, it was weakened and absorbed by the stronger storm. This, and the nearby subtropical ridge, ended up steering Luis to the west.

===Caribbean===
Due to its slow motion, Luis allowed local officials ample time to prepare. Before the storm&#x27;s arrival, a total of 17 tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared in several areas throughout the Caribbean. Over the course of September 3, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Martin, Saba, St. Eustatius, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and St. Barthelemy were placed under hurricane watch. At 0000 UTC on September 4, this was upgraded to a hurricane warning for the region from Antigua to St. Martin, and a tropical storm warning for Dominica and Guadeloupe. Six hours later, the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico, were placed under hurricane watch. By 2100 UTC, those regions had been upgraded to warning, as well as St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, and Dominica, with Saint Lucia and Martinique under a tropical storm warning.

At 1200 UTC on September 5, the tropical storm warning for St. Lucia was discontinued, and nine hours later, Dominica was downgraded to a tropical storm warning. Throughout September 6–8, all warnings were either downgraded or discontinued. Bermuda was placed under tropical storm watch at 2100 UTC on September 7. This watch was upgraded to a warning at 1500 UTC the next day, and discontinued at 0900 UTC on the 10th.

===Canada===
The Canadian Hurricane Centre began issuing advisories on the morning of September 8, about 48 hours before Luis&#x27; entry into the center&#x27;s coverage area, as the storm&#x27;s trajectory began to curve east of Florida. The Maritimes center of the Meteorological Service of Canada issued warnings for the affected areas as early as September 9, 36 hours before the arrival of the storm.

== Impact ==
=== Lesser Antilles ===

Overall, the powerful winds and heavy rainfall caused by Luis caused extensive crop and property damage across the Leeward Islands. Due to a lack of reports from some affected areas, the exact amount of damage caused by the storm is unknown, but it is estimated at US$3 billion.

==== Antigua and Barbuda ====
As a result of a direct hit from the Category 4 hurricane, Barbuda experienced and over of rain, contributing to very extensive damage. According to Lester Bird, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, most houses were damaged or eradicated at 70% in Barbuda, and nearly 45% of the residences on Antigua were damaged or destroyed by the hurricane as it passed near to the north of the island. Across the islands, numerous inhabitants experienced power outages and disrupted water systems. The storm ultimately accounted for three deaths, and injured 165 locals. 32,000 inhabitants on both islands were greatly affected, with 1,700 forced to take shelter, and approximately 3,000 left homeless. A United States station on Antigua lost its wind recording equipment when gusts reached and minimum pressure at , while an amateur radio reported an unconfirmed gust of in Barbuda. Throughout the country, the total damage from the storm was estimated at $350 million, or 60% of the country&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with most of the damage on Barbuda.

==== Guadeloupe ====
Luis caused some damage as it passed near north of Guadeloupe, predominantly to Grande-Terre. Hurricane-force conditions resulted in moderate damage to homes and roofs, uprooted trees, and severe beach erosion. The Basse-Terre region, meanwhile, received minor damage, except to banana crops that were damaged at nearly 90%, and sugar cane crops on the north at nearly 20%. Overall, of rain were recorded in the islands, while the mountain regions recorded up to . The highest rainfall within the 48-hour period was in La Grande Soufrière, where of rain damaged the west coast roads and washed away houses.

The meteorological office in Raizet recorded sustained winds of , with gusts that reached near . The office also reported a fall in minimal pressure to between 3 and 4am on September 5, and a total of of rain across the whole period. Only Desirade, the easternmost island, recorded hurricane-force winds of , and a sustained gust at between 3 and 4am on September 5, with a pressure. The storm claimed the life of a 19-year-old French tourist, who had been dragged away by vigorous waves on a pier in eastern Saint-François. The total damage was estimated at 250 million francs ($50 million USD), mostly for the crops and roads.
==== Saint Barthélemy ====
The islands suffered extensive damages from winds as the hurricane passed at least north of Saint Barthelemy. The main weather station recorded wind gust at before the anemometer broke, while other stations suggest wind speeds of and gusts of up to . This difference in measurement may be due to local effects produced by mountainous terrain on the island and the aircraft sampling winds at a level above the region of maximum winds. Additionally, minimal recorded pressure was at as the storm made its closest approach and stayed below for at least 24 hours.

==== Saint Martin ====
The eyewall of Luis passed northeast of the island of Saint Martin, causing extensive and catastrophic damage to 60% of the area, particularly on the Dutch side. A total of of rain was recorded on the island&#x27;s territory over a period of 48 hours, and the storm spawned several F3 tornadoes.

===== French Collectivity =====
In Grand Case Bay, rough sea conditions and strong winds were responsible for the damage or destruction of 90% of homes. Other towns, such as the French Quarter and Marigot, also reported extensive damage to homes and vegetation. At least 50% of houses in the Collectivity of Saint Martin were damaged, leaving between 950 and 2,000 residents homeless.

The meteorological office at the Grand Case-Espérance Airport estimated some wind gusts of over , while an unofficial anemometer in the port of Marigot recorded wind gusts at before the instrument was toppled. One person was reported dead, and, due to lack of insurances, the preliminary cost of Luis on the French Collectivity was 2 billion francs (€300 million, or US$350 million) worth of damage.

===== Sint Maarten =====
The southern part of the island, the Dutch-owned Sint Maarten, received more catastrophic damage than the northern French end. The strongest winds came onshore on the Dutch side, and the capital city of Philipsburg was at least 70% decimated by the storm. Flooding from Luis affected the Great Salt Pond, which deluged several streets.

Of the 70% of residences that were damaged in the storm, nearly 15% became uninhabitable, including businesses, churches, the main airport terminal, some schools, and four hotels. Over 5,000 Haitians living in the Dutch quarter were left homeless, while some towns on the island spent nearly three months without water and power. Of the 1,500 boats sheltered in Simpson Bay Lagoon, nearly 1,300—or 85%—were sunken or run aground. The official death toll in Sint Maarten was eight, with the possibility of more deaths by drowning in the lagoon.

Princess Juliana Airport recorded sustained winds of , with maximum gusts of up to . The barometric pressure fell, at its lowest, between . Tropical storm-force winds brushed the island for approximately 21 hours, while hurricane-force sustained winds lasted up to eight hours as the hurricane passed with minimal forward speed between . Total damages on the Dutch side were catastrophic, totaling around US$1.8 billion, and Luis was the most devastating hurricane to hit the islands since Hurricane Donna in 1960.
==== Anguilla ====
The eye of the hurricane passed over the northeastern tip of Anguilla. Although its geographic placement means that the island likely would have sustained worse damage than St. Martin, the total scale of damage is still unknown. Luis was the worst hurricane the island suffered since Hurricane Donna in 1960.

==== St. Kitts and Nevis ====
The eye of Luis passed nearly northeast of Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing severe beach erosion, moderate damage to residences, and leaving at least 2,000 residents homeless. The storm further damaged local vegetation and some of the road infrastructure, with problems essentially arising from the poor water system on the islands. Total damage ultimately reached $197 million.

==== Dominica ====
Tropical storm-force winds of roughly affected Dominica from the morning to afternoon of September 5. The lowest pressure recorded was between . As the eye of Luis passed nearly north, the majority of the damage experienced in Dominica was inflicted upon banana crops that had already been damaged from the earlier hit by Iris. While overall damages were fairly minor, beach erosion was common, and Luis disrupted several beach hotels and coastal roads. Rough waves on the northeastern and western coast affected towns such as Marigot, Roseau, and Portsmouth, leaving about 1,000 residents homeless. Ultimately, a fisherman was confirmed dead due to rough sea conditions. Property damage from Luis alone was estimated at $47 million, while the combined effects of Luis, Iris, and Hurricane Marilyn, which struck ten days later, totaled $184 million.

=== Puerto Rico ===
Luis passed at northeast of Puerto Rico, causing minor damages in the east. Two deaths were additionally reported on the island as a consequence of rushing to prepare for the arrival of the storm.

=== Bermuda ===
Bermuda reported sustained winds of up to . Offshore, the storm produced waves approaching in height. In total, little to no damage was reported on the island.

=== Eastern United States and offshore ===
Rough seas from the storm affected the East Coast of the United States, resulting in some beach erosion and damage to two waterfront structures on Fire Island. High waves, in combination with high tide, caused significant beach erosion and coastal flooding. On September 7, rip currents produced by Luis caused the death of one person near Corncake Inlet, North Carolina. In Brunswick County, North Carolina, eight homes were washed away by waves, and of the beach was lost. In nearby Hyde, Carteret, and Onslow counties, waves of up to washed out of the Triple S Pier in Atlantic Beach, effectively destroying it. Total losses in North Carolina amounted to $1.9 million. In New York, rough seas undermined and destroyed one home, and led to the death of one person who was swimming in the high waves.

=== Atlantic Canada ===

On September 11, a rogue wave triggered by Luis slammed the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; ocean liner when it was about south of eastern Newfoundland. A nearby Canadian buoy recorded a at roughly the same time. Although the ship did not sustain any significant damage, its arrival in New York was delayed considerably.

Throughout eastern Newfoundland, the system dropped of rain at its landfall as a Category 1. Northwesterly winds there gusted to . The storm caused minor damage to the large province, with flooding costing an estimated $500,000 in damages. One storm-related death was reported in Canada.
==Aftermath and economic impact==
===Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis===
Several bodies of the United Nations contributed financially to the rebuilding of areas affected by Hurricane Luis. The Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs provided $50,000 in emergency funds to the nation of Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, while the United Nations Development Programme provided an additional $50,000 to Barbados and the Netherlands Antilles. The Children&#x27;s Fund additionally provided a cash grant of $20,000 to all affected islands, and the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization contributed $20,000 to Antigua and Barbuda, $15,000 to Dominica, and $5,000 to St. Kitts and Nevis for the purposes of rebuilding schools. The Organization of American States, meanwhile, provided an emergency cash grant of $250,000 to Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and St. Kitts and Nevis.

The Government of the Bahamas provided $50,000 to affected areas, while the Government of Canada donated $149,253 to the Pan American Health Organization and $44,760 to the impacted region. They were joined by a $150,000 donation from the Government of Japan and $15,873 from the Government of Spain. Antigua and Barbuda received $37,593 from the Government of Australia, $200,000 from the Government of France, and $32,942 from the Government of New Zealand. The Government of Germany provided $52,817 in emergency funds to St. Kitts and Nevis, while the Government of the Netherlands contributed $15.2 million in emergency and recovery funds to the Netherlands Antilles. The Government of Norway provided $50,000 in cash assistance to Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis.

While most of the support was entirely financial, given in emergency and recovery funds, the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office provided relief goods, such as plastic sheeting, water containers, blankets, and basic medical supplies worth $1.2 million. The Government of Jamaica deployed military recovery teams to affected regions to assist with rehabilitation and cleanup efforts.

===Saint Martin===
The degree of devastation left by Hurricane Luis on Saint Martin left the island inaccessible by air or sea for two days. The storm left up to 2,000 citizens homeless, and rendered the island largely without electricity, running water, or telephone service. When transportation resumed, tourists scrambled for a charter flight out of Princess Juliana International Airport. Both the Netherlands and France sent soldiers and police officers to their respective sides of the island, but eyewitnesses and residents reported that the authorities did little to intercede in the widespread looting that followed the hurricane.

Aside from high winds and seeds, Saint Martin was affected by a substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at the sea-level airport, and those measured in homes throughout the island hillsides. Sea-level readings showed sustained winds and gusts of up to , while hillside measurements showed gusts between . A sailor that had been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a record wind gust, and a minimal pressure reading to .

==Records and retirement==
On August 29, Tropical Storm Luis marked the earliest date on which the twelfth named storm of the season formed, surpassing the previous record set by Tropical Storm Twelve on August 31, 1933. This record has since been broken by Hurricane Laura, which intensified into a tropical storm on August 20, 2020.

Shortly before becoming extratropical, Hurricane Luis was moving at , becoming one of the fastest-moving Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. With a hurricane force-wind field expanding over from the center, Luis had the largest radius of hurricane-force winds measured for an Atlantic hurricane until Lorenzo in 2019. It was also one of the most intense extratropical cyclones by wind speed. While extratropical cyclones usually only have wind speeds ranging from , Luis achieved major hurricane-force winds south of Newfoundland. This would not occur again until Hurricane Fiona in 2022.

On September 11, a wave struck an ocean liner as a result of Luis. This wave is the largest ever officially recorded, although Hurricane Ivan may have produced a wave of up to high off the coast of Mexico in 2004.

Since 1950, there have been very few Atlantic hurricanes that have had an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of over 50. By spending nearly fourteen days as a named storm, including seven consecutive days as a major hurricane, Luis achieved an ACE value of 53.73, the highest since Hurricane Inez in 1966. It retained this record until 2003, when Hurricane Isabel recorded an ACE of 63.3.

Due to the severe damage and loss of life caused by the storm in the Leeward Islands, the name &quot;Luis&quot; was retired in the spring of 1996 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Lorenzo&quot; for the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season.

<doc id="987228" wikidata="Q2116806" url="?curid=987228" title="Japanese cruiser Tone (1937)">
<text>was the lead ship in the two-vessel of heavy cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ship was named after the Tone River, in the Kantō region of Japan and was completed on 20 November 1938 at Mitsubishi&#x27;s Nagasaki shipyards. &quot;Tone&quot; was designed for long-range scouting missions and had a large seaplane capacity. She was extensively employed during World War II usually providing scouting services to their aircraft carrier task forces. She almost always operated in this capacity in conjunction with her sister ship . She was involved in sinking the destroyer USS &quot;Edsall&quot; in the Java Sea, before escorting aircraft carriers at the Indian Ocean Raid and battles of Midway, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz throughout 1942.

In 1944, &quot;Tone&quot; sank the British steamship &quot;Behar&quot;, and commit a war crime when anywhere between 60 and 80 civilians were murdered aboard the ship. At the battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Tone&quot; survived several bomb hits from US aircraft and in turn fought Taffy 3 where she mostly operated alongside the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, together crippling the escort carrier USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; and damaging the escort carrier USS &quot;Fanshaw bay&quot;. Near the end of the war, &quot;Tone&quot; was sunk in port by US carrier aircraft and scrapped post war.

==World War II==

===Early Pacific War===
At the end of 1941, &quot;Tone&quot; was assigned to CruDiv 8 with her sister ship, &quot;Chikuma&quot;, and was thus present during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That day, 7 December 1941, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched one Aichi E13A1 &quot;Jake&quot; floatplane for a final weather reconnaissance over Oahu. At 0630, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched short-range Nakajima E4N2 Type 90-2 Reconnaissance Seaplane to act as pickets and patrol south of the Striking Force. &quot;Tone&quot;″s floatplane flew to Lahaina, but found no American fleet units present. During the subsequent attack, the battleships , , and were sunk and , , , and many smaller ships were damaged.

On 16 December, CruDiv 8 was ordered to assist in the second attempted invasion of Wake Island. &quot;Tone&quot; launched two Nakajima E8N &quot;Daves&quot; for anti-submarine patrols. After the fall of Wake Island, CruDiv 8 returned to Kure, Hiroshima. By 14 January 1942, CruDiv 8 was based out of Truk in the Caroline Islands, and covered the landings of Japanese troops at Rabaul, New Britain as well as attacks on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea. On 24 January, &quot;Tone&quot;″s floatplanes attacked the Admiralty Islands. After 1 February air raid on Kwajalein by Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr aboard the aircraft carrier , &quot;Tone&quot; departed Truk with the Carrier Striking Force in an unsuccessful pursuit. &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; later participated in the Raid on Port Darwin, Australia on 19 February, which destroyed 15 aircraft and sinking 11 ships. &quot;Tone&quot; launched a floatplane to report in weather conditions prior to the attack, but the plane’s radio failed and it returned without reporting. Later, another floatplane had greater success, and shot down a PBY Catalina of the RAAF.

===Battle of the Java Sea===
On 1 March 1942, &quot;Tone&quot; spotted the old American destroyer , SSE of Christmas Island. Four days later, floatplanes from &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; took part on the strike against Tjilatjap. On 6 March, &quot;Tone&quot; rescued a British seaman who had been adrift since his ship had been sunk off Java on 27 February.

===Indian Ocean Raids===
On 5 April 1942, &quot;Tone&quot; was part of a major task force which launched 315 aircraft against British-held Colombo, Ceylon. The old destroyer , armed merchant cruiser and 27 aircraft were destroyed and over 500 killed in the harbor, while cruisers and were destroyed at sea. &quot;Tone&quot; and the rest of the task force returned to Japan in mid-April 1942, when it was almost immediately assigned to the unsuccessful pursuit of Admiral Halsey&#x27;s Task Force 16.2 with the aircraft carrier after the Doolittle Raid.

===Battle of Midway===
At the crucial Battle of Midway, &quot;Tone&quot; and CruDiv 8 was part of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s Carrier Striking Force. On 4 June, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched two &quot;Jakes&quot; to search out for American carriers. &quot;Tone&quot;″s floatplane discovered American ships, but owing to internal bureaucracy in their command structure its report was not immediately delivered to Admiral Nagumo. As a result, he had already ordered his aircraft to prepare for another attack on Midway before he received the report. &quot;Tone&quot; was attacked by enemy carrier aircraft during the battle, but sustained no damage, except the loss of a &quot;Dave&quot; with its crew. &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were then detached to support Vice Admiral Boshiro Hosogaya&#x27;s Aleutian invasion force. However, the anticipated American counter-attack failed to materialize. CruDiv 8 cruised northern waters uneventfully.

Rear Admiral Chuichi Hara assumed command of CruDiv 8 from 14 July 1942. With the US invasion of Guadalcanal, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were ordered south again on 16 August with the aircraft carriers , , , , and . They were joined by the battleships , , seaplane tender , and cruisers , , , .

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===
On 24 August 1942, CruDiv 7&#x27;s and arrived to join the reinforcement fleet for Guadalcanal. The following morning, a Consolidated PBY Catalina spotted &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, which Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and Grumman TBF Avengers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; unsuccessfully attacked. Seven floatplanes from &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were launched to locate the American fleet. One of &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s planes spotted the Americans, but was shot down before its report could be relayed. However, a second floatplane was more successful, and the Japanese launched an attack against &quot;Enterprise&quot;, hitting it with three bombs which set her wooden deck on fire. However, in the meantime, the Americans located the Japanese fleet, and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was sunk by planes from the carrier . &quot;Tone&quot; was attacked unsuccessfully by two Avengers whose Mark 13 torpedoes missed, returning to Truk safely.

===Battle of Santa Cruz===
Through October, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; patrolled north of the Solomon Islands, awaiting word of recapture of Henderson Field by the Japanese. On 19 October, &quot;Tone&quot; (with the destroyer ) was detached on an independent mission to scout for American ships. Both ships operated off the Santa Cruz Islands until a Kawanishi H6K &quot;Emily&quot; from Jaluit Atoll sighted a carrier off the New Hebrides. On 26 October 1942, northeast of Guadalcanal, Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe&#x27;s task force launched seven floatplanes to scout south of Guadalcanal. They located the American fleet, and Abe followed with an attack by carrier planes which sank the carrier and damaged the battleship and cruiser . However, two of the four aircraft launched by &quot;Tone&quot; during the attack were shot down.

&quot;Tone&quot; supported Japanese reinforcement efforts at Guadalcanal through mid-November 1942, and was then assigned to patrols from its base in Truk through mid-February 1943. After returning to Maizuru for refit on 21 February, two additional twin-mount Type 96 25-mm AA guns were installed along with a Type 21 air-search radar. On 15 March 1943 Rear Admiral Kishi Fukuji assumed command of CruDiv 8, and &quot;Tone&quot; was ordered back to Truk. However, on 17 May, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were tasked to accompany battleship back to Tokyo for the state funeral of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. &quot;Tone&quot; was back in Truk by 15 July, having avoided numerous submarine attacks along the route. From July to November, &quot;Tone&quot; was engaged in making troop transport runs to Rabaul, and to patrols of the Marshall Islands in unsuccessful pursuit of the American fleet. While back at Kure on 6 November, &quot;Tone&quot; gained additional 25-mm AA guns, bringing its total to 20. CruDiv 8 was disbanded on 1 January 1944, and both &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were reassigned to CruDiv 7 (with &quot;Suzuya&quot; and &quot;Kumano&quot;) under Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura. &quot;Tone&quot; returned to Truk on 2 January. In February, &quot;Tone&quot; assisted with the evacuation of Japanese forces from Truk to Palau.

From 1 March 1944, &quot;Tone&quot; was assigned to commerce raiding in the Indian Ocean. On 9 March, &quot;Tone&quot; sank the British freighter , taking aboard 108 survivors against orders. Of the survivors, 32 were disembarked as prisoners of war at Batavia. Admiral Naomasa Sakonju aboard the cruiser , ordered that the remaining prisoners be &quot;disposed of&quot;, and they were taken out to sea and beheaded. (Following the war, Sakonju was executed for war crimes, including the murder of these prisoners, while the former commander of &quot;Tone&quot;, Captain Haruo Mayazumi, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.) On 20 March 1944, Rear Admiral Kazutaka Shiraishi assumed command of CruDiv 7.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
On 13 June 1944, Admiral Soemu Toyoda activated &quot;Operation A-GO&quot; for the defense of the Mariana Islands. &quot;Tone&quot; was assigned to Force &quot;C&quot; of Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet, which proceeded through the Visayan Sea to the Philippine Sea headed towards Saipan. On 20 June, after the battleships , and carrier were attacked by aircraft from the carriers , and and the bulk of the Japanese air cover was destroyed in the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, &quot;Tone&quot; retired with the Mobile Fleet to Okinawa, and from there to Kure. While at Kure from 26 June to 8 July 1944, &quot;Tone&quot; gained additional Type 96 25-mm AA, bringing its total to 57. Two new Type 22 surface-search radars and a Type 13 air-search radar were also fitted. After ferrying army troops to Okinawa, &quot;Tone&quot; was reassigned back to Singapore in July.

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===
On 23 October 1944, &quot;Tone&quot; along with the cruisers &quot;Kumano&quot;, &quot;Suzuya&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot;, sortied from Brunei towards the Philippines with Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s First Mobile Striking Force. The battle group was attacked by submarines while steaming through the Palawan Passage. The cruisers &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; were sunk, and &quot;Takao&quot; was damaged. As the force entered the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, the Center Force suffered eleven raids by aircraft from the carriers of Task Group 38.2. &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk and &quot;Tone&quot; was hit by bombs.

==== Battle off Samar ====
The following day during the Battle off Samar, &quot;Tone&quot; served in the fight against Taffy 3, a small US task force of six escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. &quot;Tone&quot; started off the battle at 7:18 by engaging the destroyer USS &quot;Johnston&quot;, scoring no hits as in turn &quot;Johnston&quot; crippled the &quot;Kumano&quot; with 45 shell hits and a torpedo that blew off her bow, forcing her out of the battle alongside &quot;Suzuya&quot; to escort her. Shortly afterwards, she and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were attacked by American torpedo bombers at 7:30 and forced to break off from formation, and several minutes later change course to attack the escort carriers.

At 8:18, &quot;Tone&quot; joined the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; in attacking the escort carrier USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, which from 18,000 yards, they successfully hit with three 8-inch (203 mm) shells. Simultaneously, aircraft strafing killed one sailor and injured several others. After &quot;Haguro&quot; was forced to disengage after being hit by two bombs and two 5-inch (127 mm) shells from &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, destroying her forward superfiring turret, &quot;Tone&quot; switched fire to the attacking destroyer USS &quot;Heermann&quot;&quot;,&quot; firing thirty 8-inch (203 mm) rounds and four torpedoes, straddling &quot;Heermann&quot; several times and forcing her to turn away. After &quot;Haguro&quot; had finished helping to sink the destroyer USS &quot;Hoel&quot;, she and &quot;Tone&quot; closed to 10,000 yards, and reengaged &quot;Kalinin Bay,&quot; crippling her with another eleven 8-inch (203 mm) shell hits, before &quot;Tone&quot; was forced to dodge air attacks from Taffy 2 and Taffy 3 aircraft during the same attacks that sank her sistership &quot;Chikuma&quot; with several torpedo hits, while sperate air attacks sank the heavy cruisers and &quot;Suzuya&quot;. By 8:55, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; took aim at the escort carrier USS &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;. &quot;Tone&quot; fired 28 rounds, hitting &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; with a single 8-inch (203 mm) shell, whilst &quot;Haguro&quot; struck the escort carrier with three 8-inch (203 mm) shells, starting a fire in her hanger bay and disabling her aircraft elevator.

With three heavy cruisers sunk and a fourth crippled, Admiral Kurita ordered a retreat from the battle, prompting &quot;Tone&quot; to disengage Taffy 3. While retreating, &quot;Tone&quot; was hit by two bombs from carrier aircraft, one was a dud, but the other disabled her steering wheel, forcing her crew to manually control the rudder. Throughout the next day, several aircraft raided Kurita&#x27;s fleet, but &quot;Tone&quot; was not damaged and returned to Brunei on the 28th.

===Drydock and use as a training ship===
On 6 November, &quot;Tone&quot; departed Brunei towards Manila, and onward to Mako in the Pescadores and Kure. Back in dry dock in Maizuru, &quot;Tone&quot; gained four additional triple-mount 25-mm AA guns aft, bringing its total to 62. The Type 21 radar was replaced with a Type 22. CruDiv 7 was disbanded 21 November and &quot;Tone&quot; reassigned to CruDiv 5 with &quot;Kumano&quot;. Once repairs were completed on 18 February 1945, &quot;Tone&quot; relocated to Etajima, where it was moored for use as a training ship. It was slightly damaged in an air raid on 19 March.

===Sinking during the bombing of Kure===

On 24 July 1945, Task Force 38 launched a large air raid against Kure aimed at the final destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Nine aircraft from the light carrier &quot;Monterey&quot; hit &quot;Tone&quot; with three bombs, causing her to settle to the bottom of the bay. The hulk was attacked again on 28 July by rockets and armor-piercing bombs dropped by planes from the carriers , and . &quot;Tone&quot; was removed from the Navy List on 20 November 1945 and scrapped after the war from 1947–1948.

<doc id="987231" wikidata="Q408285" url="?curid=987231" title="Commensurability (philosophy of science)">
<text>Commensurability is a concept in the philosophy of science whereby scientific theories are said to be &quot;commensurable&quot; if scientists can discuss the theories using a shared nomenclature that allows direct comparison of them to determine which one is more valid or useful. On the other hand, theories are incommensurable if they are embedded in starkly contrasting conceptual frameworks whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite empirical evidence favoring one theory over the other. Discussed by Ludwik Fleck in the 1930s, and popularized by Thomas Kuhn in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.

== Introduction of the term ==

In 1962, Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases, the concept came from mathematics; in its original sense, it is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two variables, such as the prediction of the diagonal of a square from the relationship of its sides.

The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific theories. Its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain theses proposed by followers of the received view of theories. These include the famous &quot;thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge&quot;, which states that the body of scientific knowledge has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a model that sees both revolutions and periods of normalcy in the history of science.

Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a neutral language of comparison which can be used to formulate the empirical consequences of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers—or the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is Popperian.

The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates. Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B – and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of rationality.

In both cases, the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.

== Perspectives ==

=== Feyerabend&#x27;s perspectives ===
Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of semantics which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T&#x27;.

Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of &quot;incommensurability,&quot; which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to Karl Popper&#x27;s London School of Economics seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians (Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, H. L. A. Hart and Georg Henrik von Wright) in Anscombe&#x27;s Oxford flat. Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus scientific paradigms, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend&#x27;s notion of incommensurability is as follows:
# The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory.
# Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge.
# Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates.

According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in formal logic, because it is a phenomenon outside of logic&#x27;s domain.

==== Theories ====
In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism whereby &quot;investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation.&quot; (Feyerabend, 1989; pp. 96). Scientific methodology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T&#x27; which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T&#x27; answers both questions then T is discarded.

That is, a new theory T&#x27;, in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths, and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T—the failures in the old theory—which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F).

Given this model it is possible to construct relational statements between certain terms from T and from T&#x27;, which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T&#x27; in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other.

However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T&#x27; will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of observation will be commensurable. In the same way, if a realist perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given.

It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to affirm the relational character of longitude, this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to quantum mechanics (QM) as opposed to classical mechanics (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other.

In this same way Feyerabend comments that:

==== Realist objections ====

In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an argument elaborated by Carnap and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as &quot;...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection.&quot; (Feyerabend, pp. 373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.

Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and panrationalism in science. 
This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared.

Feyerabend&#x27;s answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn&#x27;t explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial conditions than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. 
In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks &quot;why should it be necessary to have a terminology that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of Aristotle and Newton.&quot;

==== Theory selection ====

The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position:

Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper&#x27;s arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality &quot;a posteriori&quot; to the selection. While, Feyerabend&#x27;s position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper&#x27;s first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration:

Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper&#x27;s rationality a &quot;mere verbal ornament.&quot; This does not imply that Feyerabend is an irrationalist but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability.

=== Kuhn&#x27;s perspectives ===
The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is Thomas Kuhn, who introduced it in his 1962 book, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive paradigms. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn&#x27;s work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a taxonomic sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world.

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that &quot;the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them&quot;. According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other&#x27;s point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability:
# Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy.
# The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network.
# The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research.

In a postscript (1969) to &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of similarity sets in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one&#x27;s mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language.

Kuhn&#x27;s thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of Michael Polanyi who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, &quot;think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world.&quot;

==== Phases ====

Given his changing definition of incommensurability Pérez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn&#x27;s work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract:

The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies symmetry and transitivity so that if theory T is translatable with theory T&#x27;, then T&#x27; can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T&quot; and this can be translated to T&#x27;, then theories T and T&#x27; cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another.

Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage:

This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn&#x27;s sense of rationality is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation.

In the third stage of Kuhn&#x27;s work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in taxonomic terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes – its intention – but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a holistic manner meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.

==== Taxonomic characterization ====

Taxonomic characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap principle, since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable – they are isomorphic. 
This characterization was already present in Kuhn&#x27;s writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.

==== Reluctance ====

An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn&#x27;s writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of philosophy. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn&#x27;s rejection of his critics, such as Popper and Davidson.

However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn&#x27;s solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn&#x27;s work suggests four aspects to this question:

* Firstly, in order to carry out such an assimilation it is necessary that the complementary vocabulary is easily understood.
* Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential.
* Thirdly, class concepts cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets.
* Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter.

=== Conclusion ===

It can be concluded that Kuhn&#x27;s idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into irrationalism nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as &quot;Problems of Empiricism&quot; and &quot;Against Method&quot; that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions.

==Meta-incommensurability==
A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways.

Eric Oberheim and Paul Hoyningen-Huene argue that realist and anti-realist philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable.

Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of meaning. He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend&#x27;s concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

<doc id="987233" wikidata="Q5948094" url="?curid=987233" title="Hurricane Marilyn">
<text>Hurricane Marilyn was the most powerful hurricane to strike the Virgin Islands since Hurricane Hugo of 1989, and the third such tropical cyclone in roughly a two-week time span to strike or impact the Leeward Islands, the others being Hurricane Iris and the much more powerful and destructive Hurricane Luis. The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane and third major hurricane of the extremely active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Marilyn formed on September 12 as a tropical depression from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 7. After formation, the storm quickly became a tropical storm, and steadily intensified into a hurricane by the time it struck the Lesser Antilles on September 14 at Category 1 strength. Entering the northeastern Caribbean Sea, rapid intensification ensued and it peaked on September 16 north of Puerto Rico as a Category 3 hurricane shortly after it had impacted the U.S. Virgin Islands. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones. After heading north past Bermuda, Marilyn weakened and became extratropical on September 22. The remnant circulation wandered the Atlantic Ocean from September 23 – October 1, just south of Nova Scotia.

Marilyn is responsible for a total of thirteen deaths, most due to drowning on boats or offshore.
Eleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of St. Thomas, and estimated damages were set at $2 billion (1995 USD) in the USVI. The same area would be struck by Hurricane Bertha the next year, while still repairing from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn, then successively hit by Hortense, Erika, Georges, Jose, Lenny and Debby.

==Meteorological history==

Marilyn&#x27;s origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the African coast on September 7. Large, low-level winds were included in the wave&#x27;s circulation, but little convection existed. The system continued west for a few days at about next to an anticyclonic aloft. On September 12, satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it Tropical Depression Fifteen, after convection had increased. Tropical Depression Fifteen strengthened rapidly, becoming Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later. One day after being named, Marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status, while turning on a more northwesterly track.

For the next few days, Marilyn&#x27;s track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Marilyn was a Category 1 hurricane; it passed north of Barbados and Martinique. Marilyn passed over Dominica, and just Îles des Saintes and southwest of Guadeloupe on September 14, bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it. Marilyn continued on its northwesterly track, making landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15, packing winds of , a strong Category 2 strength hurricane. The eyewall, east-southeast of the center of Marilyn, passed over Saint Thomas later that day. After passing over Puerto Rico, Marilyn entered back into the Atlantic Ocean on September 16.

A low had formed near Marilyn, which may have enhanced outflow from the system. An eye formed in the center of Marilyn, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of , a lower-end Category 3 hurricane. At this time, Marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of . Reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima. Marilyn started weakening rapidly, falling from peak-level winds of down to . The central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only 10 hours. This rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system, a decaying eyewall, and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm, Hurricane Luis. As Marilyn weakened to Category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest, it passed about west of Bermuda on September 19. As Marilyn encountered more westerly shear, it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on September 20, centered in the northeastern Atlantic. The remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central Atlantic Ocean for another 10 days before being absorbed by a frontal low on September 30.

A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones.

==Preparations==
Seventeen watches and/or warnings were issued in association with Marilyn. The first two were a tropical storm watch and a tropical storm warning issued on Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenadines, St. Lucia and Grenada on September 12 at 2200 UTC. Five hours later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Trinidad and Tobago. A tropical storm warning was issued for St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenadines, Grenada and Tobago at 900 UTC September 13. At 2100 UTC, a Hurricane Warning was issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenadines, St. Lucia and a hurricane watch for Dominica. A hurricane watch as released for Martinique on September 14. The 2100 UTC September 13 was extended for the Grenadines through St. Martin, except Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy and French portion of St. Martin. At 1500 UTC, Puerto Rico was put under a Hurricane Watch. At 1700 UTC, Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy, and French portion of St. Martin were put under a hurricane watch. Four hours later, Puerto Rico, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe were put under a hurricane warning.

Throughout the night, several watches and warnings were discontinued. At 1500 UTC September 15, Dominican Republic from Cabrera to Cabo Engano were put under a hurricane watch as Marilyn approached. During the night of September 16, all currently active watches and warnings were discontinued. At around the same time, a new Hurricane watch was released for Turks and Caicos and Mayaguana, Acklins, and the Crooked Islands of the southeastern Bahamas. This warning was discontinued within 48 hours. At 1500 UTC September 18, Bermuda came under a Tropical Storm Watch, which was upgraded to a warning in six hours. The warning was discontinued on September 19.

The 250,000 residents of Barbados spent the night of September 13 in shelters.

==Impact==
Marilyn caused about $2.3 billion and 13 deaths throughout the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The exact figure for damages in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is not available, although the American Insurance Services Group set the combined damage at $875 million. Aside from high winds and seas, one possible explanation for the storm&#x27;s heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations. Marilyn struck a mere 10days after Luis, a more powerful Category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to St. Thomas. This prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre-storm preparations; however, Luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage. Virgin Islanders questioned the accuracy of the National Hurricane Center wind advisories, as Hurricane Marilyn caused significant damage for a mere &quot;category 2&quot; storm. Damage on St. Thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on St. Croix in 1989, when Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, caused catastrophic damage. Because St. Thomas is a very hilly island, it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills (some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level) were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory. Residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods.

===Martinique===
Rainfalls in Martinique peaked at in Morne Rouge, in Ajoupa Bouillon, in Saint Pierre, ranging as low as in Ducos. The highest wind gust reported was in Trinite, the location of the only recorded sustained winds in Martinique, which was .

===Guadeloupe===

Hurricane Marilyn moved directly across Îles des Saintes and the southern part of Basse-Terre Island in the night of September 14–15, 1995, bringing the highest known rainfall totals to the island from a tropical cyclone.
Rainfalls over 12-hours in Guadeloupe were up to in Saint-Claude, in Guillard-Basse-Terre and in Gaba. The highest wind gust reported in Guadeloupe was in Marie-Galante. The next ones were near in Raizet with maximal wind gust at in Desirade. 
Minimal pressure recorded at in Basse-Terre.

Damage was moderate in the south, due to the massive amount of rainfall. Marilyn was one of the three hurricanes that affected the region in 1995, after Iris and Luis; the total estimated damage was near 500 million francs.

===U.S. Virgin Islands===
The highest wind speed left by Marilyn after passing over the island of St. Croix was . The highest rainfalls reported were in Annually, in Red Hook Bay and in Granard. The highest storm surge reported was in St. Thomas and in St. Croix. According to NOAA, The storm surge in the U.S. Virgin Islands reached 6 to , with an isolated storm tide of reported on St. Croix. In St. Croix and St. Thomas, rainfall totals reached about 10 in.

The highest reported gusts were in a Noncommissioned Automated Surface Observing System and gusts in Sailboat Puffin at Green Cay. The highest sustained winds were in a Noncommissioned Automated Surface Observing System.
Marilyn was directly responsible for seven deaths, most due to drowning on boats or offshore. Ten thousand people were left homeless on St. Thomas, and most buildings sustained some damage.

The island of St. Thomas was the hardest hit by the storm, where about 80% of the homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital and the water desalination plant; five people were killed. Storm surge in the Charlotte Amalie harbor beached the USCGC &quot;Point Ledge&quot; and damaged many smaller boats. Elsewhere in the territory, there was moderate to severe damage on St. Croix and St. John. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated $1 billion in losses, while an economic research group in the U.S. Virgin Islands set the damage toll at $3 billion. Additionally, losses on St. Thomas were about $1.5 billion and for a total of $2 billion in the three U.S. Virgin Islands.
===Puerto Rico===
The highest rainfalls reported in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Marilyn were in Naguabo, in Luquillo Pico Del Este (Luquillo Pico Of the East), at Luis Muñoz International Airport, and at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The highest gusts reported were in Culebra, at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and at a non-commissioned Automated Surface Observing System. The highest recorded sustained winds was at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. Marilyn passed over the islands of Vieques and Culebra, where it caused much damage.

There were reports of extensive flash flooding across northern and eastern Puerto Rico, and 12,000 people were forced to ride out the storm in shelters. One person was killed in Culebra. President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico a federal disaster area, making it available to federal aid.

100 homes on Culebra Island, east of Puerto Rico, were destroyed by Marilyn. Another two hundred homes on the island were damaged.

===Antigua===
The highest reported gust in Antigua was . The Antigua Meteorological Service reported that the island had extensive flooding and damage to banana trees. The other damage reported was from the wind.

===Other areas===
Bermuda reported sustained winds of 45 mph and a highest gust of . Antigua reported sustained winds of just , tropical depression-strength. In St. Maarten, sustained winds were and the peak gust was . Rainfalls in St. Maarten peaked at in an unknown location. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the British Virgin Islands had little to no damage from Marilyn. The highest gust in Saint-Barthelemy was and the highest sustained winds of was reported.

==Aftermath==

===Puerto Rico===
Relief supplies in the wake of Hurricane Marilyn were sent to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Officials of FEMA set up camps on the islands to give out food, water and shelter supplies.

===U.S. Virgin Islands===

President of the United States Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a federal disaster area, making it available to federal aid. However, the National Guard did not appear on St. Thomas until two days following the hurricane, and FEMA did not appear until three days following. In the meantime, significant looting, particularly of grocery stores, prevented an orderly distribution of food and water.
 Five supply distribution sites were being operated by the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA). More than 2,100 federal agency personnel had been deployed to help out with the cleanup from Hurricane Marilyn. Four contracts were quickly accepted for immediate building repairs. Diving teams were sent to check for harbor damage and United States Navy Seabees started working on repairing public buildings. Military and security forces included about 500 Army, Air Force, and Navy personnel, 500 National Guardsmen, and 500 federal law enforcement personnel. The airport in St. Thomas was open for flight using a mobile control tower. The St. Thomas hospital was open, but was running on generators.

The first FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers opened on September 23 on St. Thomas. A reported indicated that by October 11, 1500 loans were granted for home repair, mostly for under $2500. More than 19,000 disaster housing applications were filed, with over 2800 being accepted. About 5000 of 15,000 assigned inspections were completed. Over 7800 applications for Individual and Family Grants had been received and, of the 4,000 SBA loan applications filed, 43 had been approved for a total of $744,100 – an average loan of $17,300.

===Retirement===

Due to the destruction caused by the hurricane, the name &quot;Marilyn&quot; was retired in the spring of 1996 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical storm. The name was replaced &quot;Michelle&quot; for the 2001 season.

<text>Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) is a private Nazarene university in Nampa, Idaho.

==History==

Eugene Emerson organized a combination grade school and Bible school in 1913 as Idaho Holiness School. It was renamed twice in 1916, first to Northwest Holiness College and then to Northwest Nazarene College, and then became a liberal arts college in 1917 with degree-granting authority from the Idaho state Board of Education. While the college&#x27;s first president, elected in 1916, was H. Orton Wiley of Pasadena University, Fred J. Shields filled in as acting president before leaving for the Eastern Nazarene College in 1919, while Wiley finished his graduate work.

Under Russell V. DeLong, Northwest Nazarene College (NNC) received educational accreditation as a two-year school in 1931 and as a four-year school in 1937, making it the first accredited college affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene. Master&#x27;s degree programs were added in the 1960s and 1970s. It was renamed Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) in 1999.

Northwest Nazarene University was granted an exception to Title IX in 2014 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

==Affiliations==
As one of eight U.S. liberal arts colleges affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene, the college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches on its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school. Each college is also bound by a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement not to actively recruit outside its respective educational region.

NNU is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU). NNU has been accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) since 1930.

==Academics==
Northwest Nazarene University has two colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Adult and Graduate Studies. NNU offers over 60 baccalaureate degree programs, 11 master&#x27;s degree programs, a Ph.D. degree program, and a Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) in clinical psychology. In addition to its campus in Nampa, the university offers extensive online degree programs and has branch campuses in Boise, Twin Falls, and Idaho Falls.

==Student life==
NNU is a co-educational college according to InsideHigherEd and the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities

===LGBTQ students===
In 2019, NNU was ranked among the &quot;Absolute Worst Campuses for LGBTQ Youth&quot; in the US by Campus Pride. The Church of the Nazarene Manual 2017–2021 states that &quot;we believe the practice of same-sex sexual intimacy is contrary to God’s will for human sexuality&quot;. The university&#x27;s Notice of Non-discrimination states that &quot;The University maintains the right, with regard to its lifestyle covenant, employment, and other matters, to uphold and apply its religious beliefs related to, among other issues, marriage, sex (gender), gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual activity.&quot;

==Athletics==
The Northwest Nazarene (NNU) athletic teams are called the Nighthawks (Crusaders until 2017). The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) since the 2001–02 academic year. The Nighthawks previously competed in the D-II Pacific West Conference (PacWest) during the 2000–01 school year; and in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1993–94 to 1999–2000.

NNU competes in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball.

==Notable people==
Notable graduates include Lori Otter, First Lady of the State of Idaho. Kent R. Hill, the former administrator for USAID&#x27;s Bureau for Global Health and former president of the Eastern Nazarene College (1992-2001), Richard Hieb, NASA astronaut, author Donna Fletcher Crow, and theologian Thomas Jay Oord. A notable non-graduate alumna is Mildred Bangs Wynkoop, also a theologian. Notable former faculty members include Fred J. Shields, H. Orton Wiley, Ben Fischer and Olive Winchester.

<doc id="987266" wikidata="Q3328602" url="?curid=987266" title="Music of Myanmar">
<text>The music of [[Myanmar]] (or Burma) () shares many similarities with other musical styles in the region. Traditional music is melodic, having its own unique form of harmony, often composed with a (&quot;na-yi-se&quot;), a (&quot;wa-let-se&quot;) or a () time signature. In Burmese, music segments are combined into patterns, and then into verses, making it a multi-level hierarchical system. Various levels are manipulated to create a song. Harmony in &quot;Mahagita&quot; (the Burmese body of music) is known as &quot;twe-lone,&quot; which is similar to a chord in western music. For example, C is combined with F or G.

Musical instruments include the brass &quot;se&quot; (which is like a triangle), &quot;hne&quot; (a kind of oboe), the bamboo &quot;wa&quot;, as well as the well-known &quot;saung&quot;, a boat-shaped harp. Traditionally, the instruments are classified into five groups called (). These instruments are played on a musical scale consisting of seven tones, each associated with an animal that is said to be the producer of the tone. Each tone can be raised, lowered, or played naturally (corresponding to sharp, flat or natural), resulting in twenty-one possible combinations. The pat waing drum circle, for example, consists of twenty-one drums, one tuned to each tone in each possible combination. Similarly, the &quot;Kyi Waing,&quot; a twenty-one gong instrument is struck with a knobbed stick placed alongside the pat waing. Western music gained popularity in Burma during the 1930s, despite the government&#x27;s intervention. During the socialist era, musicians and artists were subject to censorship by the Press Scrutiny Board and Central Registration Board, as well as laws like the State Protection Law. Classical music was also introduced during the British occupation. Pop music emerged in the 1970s and was banned by state-run radio stations. However, many artists circumvented this censorship by producing albums in private studios and releasing them in music production shops. Rock music, called stereo in Burmese, has been a popular form of music since the 1980s. When the country&#x27;s regulations on censorship were loosened in 2000, many pop groups emerged throughout Myanmar such as Electronic Machine, Playboy, ELF Myanmar, and the King. In August 2012, state censorship on music was officially abolished.

== Traditional music ==

=== Classical traditions ===
The orthodox Theravada Buddhism rejects music as being decadent, but despite this cultural backdrop, the Burmese monarchy along with the infusion of different regional music styles, created several classical traditions of Burmese music. The oldest of such influences may perhaps come from China, which shares a similar pentatonic musical scale as classical Burmese music. Other influences include Mon music (called or &quot;sounds of the Talaing [Mon]&quot;), particularly in the &quot;Mahāgīta&quot; (), the complete body of classical Burmese music.

A prevailing one is called (), which is essentially a class of Burmese adaptations to songs accompanied with the saung gauk and come from the Ayutthaya kingdom (modern-day Thailand) during the reigns of Bayinnaung (1551–1581) and Hsinbyushin (1753–1776), which brought back a variety of cultural traditions including the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The primary indigenous form is called ().

Burmese classical music ensembles can be divided into outdoor and indoor ensembles. The outdoor musical ensemble is the (); also called (), which was an outdoor ensemble in royal courts used to mark important ceremonial functions like the royal ploughing ceremony. It consists of a (), a large double reed pipe and (), a pair of ceremonial drums, as well as the &quot;si&quot; () and &quot;wa&quot; (), a bell and clapper and the , a double-headed drum. Today, music is played at festivals. Other instruments used in classical music include the (a harp) and (a xylophone). The indoor form is the chamber music ensemble, which basically comprises a female singer accompanied by a traditional ensemble consisting of the (), (), (, a zither), (, a flute) and in the past also included the (, a fiddle) and (a small mouth organ).

=== Mahagita ===
Translated as &quot;great music&quot; in Pali, the Mahāgīta is an extensive collection of Burmese classical songs called . The collection is divided into several different types of songs including the following: &quot;kyo&quot;, &quot;bwe&quot;, , the oldest repertoires; , royal court music; , songs of longing; ; , music that makes horses dance; &quot;nat chin&quot;, songs used to worship the , Burmese spirits; , music introduced from Ayutthaya, , music adapted from the Mon people and , songs of sorrow.

=== Folk traditions ===
Burmese music includes a variety of folk traditions. A distinct form of which is called the (), often played at religious festivals and sung to the beat of a long and thin drum, with occasional interruptions by the beating of a larger drum.

The traditional folk ensemble, typically used in &quot;nat pwe&quot; (Burmese theatre, art and festivals) is called the hsaing waing (). It is mainly made up of different gongs and drums, as well as other instruments, depending on the nature of performance. The ensemble bears many similarities to other Southeast Asian ensembles, although it incorporates a drum circle not found in similar ensembles. The ensemble is made up of a series of drums and gongs, including the center pieces, which are the &quot;hne&quot; (double reed pipe) and , set of 21 tuned drums in a circle.

Other instruments in this ensemble include the (, small bronze gongs in a circular frame) and (, larger bronze gongs in a rectangular frame), as well as the &quot;si&quot; and &quot;wa&quot; (bell and clapper) and the recent addition of the (a group of six drums which have gained currency since the early 20th century). Hsaing waing music, however, is atypical in Southeast Asian music, characterised by sudden shifts in rhythm and melody as well as change in texture and timbre.

== Popular music ==
=== Early beginnings ===
Western music has gained popularity in Burma since the 1930s. Despite the government&#x27;s intervention at times, especially during the socialist era, popular Burmese music has seen considerable influence from Western music, which consists of popular Western songs rendered in Burmese and pop music similar to other Asian pop tunes. Classical music was also introduced during the British occupation. Cult folk musician Nick Drake was born in Burma during British rule.

Rock music, called &quot;stereo&quot; in Burmese, has been a popular form of music since the 1980s, having been introduced in the 1960s. Pop music emerged in the 1970s and was banned by state-run radio stations. However, many artists circumvented this censorship by producing albums in private studios and releasing them in music production shops. During the socialist era, musicians and artists were subject to censorship by the Press Scrutiny Board and Central Registration Board, as well as laws like the State Protection Law. During this period, the arrival of various bands including the influential Thabawa Yinthwenge (The Wild Ones), which included lead singer Sai Htee Saing, an ethnic Shan, in 1973 paved the way for ethnic minority musicians to gain visibility in the Burmese music industry. Sai Kham Leik is a well known composer associated with &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;. Other contemporary singers were Khin Maung Toe, Kaiser, Hlwan Moe, Htoo Ein Thin, Soe Lwin Lwin, Saung Oo Hlaing, Lay Phyu, May Sweet, Maykhala, and Connie.

=== 1980s-1990s ===
During the 8888 Uprising, restrictions loosened and many artists began writing music with themes of freedom and democracy. However, after the State Law and Order Restoration Council usurped power in 1988, the Press Scrutiny Board was reformed to censor specific political and social issues, including poverty, the sex trade, democracy, and human rights. The Myanmar Music Asiayon (MMA) was established by the SLORC to further censor Burmese-produced music. Popular musicians including Zaw Win Htut and Sai Htee Saing have produced propaganda albums written by military officers such as Mya Than San.

Hip hop and rap emerged in the late 1990s and is now the prevailing genre of music among Burmese youth today.
Bands like Iron Cross, Emperor and BigBag are popular among older Burmese and certain groups of youth. There are hip-hop enthusiasts all over Burma with Burmese hip-hop artists such as Ye Lay, Sai Sai Kham Hlaing, and J-me. There are also many underground rock and metal bands such as All Else I Fail, Last Day of Beethoven, Temper Level VIII, Tha Ta Lin Chate, Idiots, Offkeys, We Are the Waste, The Last Secret, etc. but mostly producing nu-metal and metalcore. As for heavy metal, the scene is growing steadily but remains less popular compared to mainstream music. Despite very few metal bands in Burma, the metal band aficionado society is united and supportive of raw black metal, thrash metal, and death metal. Burmese cover songs (particularly from Asia) represented early pop music in the country as artists recorded and performed &quot;copy tunes,&quot; which were reproductions of international pop songs performed in Burmese. Singers such as Min Min Latt paved the way for other artists such as Myanmar&#x27;s version of Lady Gaga, Phyu Phyu Kyaw Thein, R Zarni and Sai Sai Kham Leng.

=== 2000s-present ===
When the country&#x27;s regulations on censorship were loosened in 2000, new pop groups emerged across Myanmar who were able to compose, record and perform original Burmese music. Many pop groups emerged throughout Myanmar such as Electronic Machine, Playboy, ELF Myanmar and the King. In August 2012, state censorship on music was officially abolished. The only government censorship that remains on music is video censorship. Everyone can, in essence, release whatever they want. This has led many on the newly re-grouped Myanmar Music Association to grapple with the idea of forming a rating system to deal with some &#x27;rude words&#x27; in music that may not be appropriate for all ages.

After decades underground, a small but enduring punk rock and heavy metal music scene has been increasingly visible in Burma. Modelling many 1970s and &#x27;80s classic Western punk bands and Modern Metal. Burmese punk band metal band shows a musical defiance that has not been seen before in Burma. In the German made 2012 documentary film &quot;Yangon Calling&quot; over a period of six weeks film-makers Alexander Dluzak and Carsten Piefke secretly filmed, as they documented the Burmese punks life, documenting everything from meeting friends and family, visiting rehearsals and filming secret concerts.

Websites that have started up in recent years such as Myanmar Xbands have given attention to the Burmese punk scene along with other alternative Burmese music. The site has developed into a hub for artists to display their music to a Burmese and international audience for free download. Most of the Talented Bands Like Last Day of Beethoven, Darkest Tears from My Heart, Fever 109, We Are the Waste are well known by others because of this website. While other Burmese punk bands like pop punk band Side Effect, turned to raising funds on IndieGoGo, to release their first album. The band just managed to raise enough funds to release their album in May 2012, shortly before their efforts fell short to international sanctions. However, other popular Burmese punk bands such as No Uturn or Rebel Riot has turned to self-release, releasing their demos on popular download sites such as MySpace and Reverb Nation.

==Musical instruments==
Burmese music has a wide variety of musical instruments, including the brass se (which is like a triangle), &quot;hne&quot; (a kind of oboe) and bamboo wa, as well as the well-known &quot;saung&quot;, a boat-shaped harp. Beginning just before World War II, the piano was adapted to the performance of Burmese traditional music, modelling its technique after that of the &quot;pattala&quot; and &quot;saung&quot;. The best known performer of Burmese piano was Gita Lulin Maung Ko Ko, known as U Ko Ko (1928–2007).

The Burmese harp is of special significance. It dates back to the 9th century, though it has changed quite a bit since then, expanding, for example, from three strings to sixteen. During the Konbaung period (1752–1885), courtly musicians included Queen Ma Mya Galay, Princess Hlaing Hteikhaung Tin, Minister Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa, and King Nat Shin Naung of Taungoo.

Burmese musical instruments are traditionally classified into five classes, called &quot;pyissin turiya&quot; ():
# &quot;Kyei&quot; () - brass instruments
# &quot;Thayei&quot; () - leather-covered drums
# &quot;Kyo&quot; () - string instruments
# &quot;Lei&quot; () - wind instruments
# &quot;Letkhok&quot; () - percussion instruments

=== Tuning ===
These instruments are played in a musical scale consisting of seven tones, each associated with an animal that is said to be the producer of the tone. Each tone can be played raised, lowered or natural (corresponding to sharp, flat or natural), resulting a possible twenty-one combinations. The &quot;pat waing&quot; drum circle, for example, consists of twenty-one drums, one tuned to each tone in each possible combination, and the &quot;saing saya&quot; (maestro) sits in the middle using various parts of his hands to strike the drums to produce a melody. The &quot;kyi waing&quot; is the gong circle strung up in the same fashion and the gongs are struck with a knobbed stick and in accompaniment to the &quot;pat waing&quot;.

<doc id="987267" wikidata="Q5071864" url="?curid=987267" title="Change of Heart (band)">
<text>Change of Heart was a Canadian alternative rock band, active from 1982 to 1997. They had one Top 40 hit, &quot;There You Go&quot; in 1992, as well as several hits on Canada&#x27;s modern rock charts, including &quot;Trigger&quot; and &quot;Little Kingdoms&quot;.

The band had a diverse, genre-defying sound, with the songs on their albums crossing from pop to hard rock to something almost akin to punk.

==History==
The band was formed in 1982 in Toronto, Ontario by vocalist and guitarist Ian Blurton and bassist Rob Taylor, initially inspired by contemporary punk rock bands such as The Clash, Gang of Four and L&#x27;Étranger.

Over the next number of years, Blurton also participated in a number of side projects, working with Jolly Tambourine Man, Cowboy Junkies, Slightly Damaged and A Neon Rome. Original percussionist Mike Armstrong left the band during the recording of their 1987 album &quot;Slowdance&quot;, and would later join King Cobb Steelie.

The band&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Soapbox&quot; featured the song &quot;Pat&#x27;s Decline&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single to garner widespread national exposure on MuchMusic and &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;.

Drummer Ron Duffy left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Glenn Milchem for the recording of their 1992 album &quot;Smile&quot;. Following the recording, Milchem left to join Blue Rodeo, and was replaced by John Richardson. Bernard Maiezza, formerly of A Neon Rome, also joined the band during this era.

&quot;Smile&quot; was produced by Michael-Philip Wojewoda, at the same time as he was juggling two other significant projects, Barenaked Ladies&#x27; &quot;Gordon&quot; and Rheostatics&#x27; &quot;Whale Music&quot;. The album, which was recorded in just four days on a budget of just $5,000, spawned the band&#x27;s only Top 40 charting single, &quot;There You Go&quot;, which took off after a radio program director in Saskatchewan placed the song in rotation on his station. The album, a sprawling 21-song release which the band acknowledged would have been a double album if it had been released prior to the compact disc era, was compared by critics to Sonic Youth&#x27;s influential &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;. Fellow musicians also frequently praised the album; Milchem wore a Change of Heart T-shirt in Blue Rodeo&#x27;s music video for &quot;Rain Down on Me&quot;, Steven Page wore one in Barenaked Ladies&#x27; video for &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;, and Andrew Scott wore one in Sloan&#x27;s original video for &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;.

Following a cross-Canada tour with Crash Vegas, Taylor chose to leave the band. He was replaced by John Borra, Maiezza&#x27;s former bandmate in A Neon Rome who had also previously toured as a solo artist opening for Change of Heart. The band then embarked on tours as an opening act for The Tragically Hip and Blue Rodeo. They also won $100,000 from that year&#x27;s CFNY-FM &quot;Discovery to Disc&quot; competition, over Treble Charger and Killjoys.

Following the tour to support their 1994 album &quot;Tummysuckle&quot;, Borra left the band and was replaced by Rob Higgins for the band&#x27;s final album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Steelteeth&quot;. Videos for the singles &quot;Little Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Grifter&#x27;s Plow&quot; received substantial airplay on MuchMusic&#x27;s alternative showcase program &quot;The Wedge&quot;.

The band toured in 1997 to support &quot;Steelteeth&quot;, including the Another Roadside Attraction festival tour, but broke up soon afterward.

Blurton, the band&#x27;s singer and main songwriter, went on to form the bands Blurtonia and C&#x27;mon, as well as becoming a record producer. Maiezza went on to form Cookie Duster with Brendan Canning of hHead; that band released its debut album, produced by Blurton, in 2001.

==Reunion==
The band&#x27;s &quot;Steelteeth&quot; lineup, consisting of Blurton, Richardson, Higgins and Maiezza, reformed for a one-off show at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto on June 20, 2009.

A new 25 song, two-LP compilation entitled &quot;There You Go &#x27;82 - &#x27;97&quot; has been assembled by Ian Blurton and was released on September 18, 2012 by Sonic Unyon Records. To celebrate, the band reunited for a series of reunion shows starting with the 2012 edition of the Supercrawl festival in Hamilton, Ontario on September 15. On October 5, 2012 there was a special Change of Heart show at the Horseshoe Tavern, which featured the participation of every former band member.

The lineup of Blurton, Maiezza, Milchem and Taylor reunited again in 2017 for the 25th anniversary vinyl reissue of the &quot;Smile&quot; album, playing shows in Ontario and Alberta.

<doc id="987269" wikidata="Q5628920" url="?curid=987269" title="HAL Computer Systems">
<text>HAL Computer Systems, Inc was a Campbell, California-based computer manufacturer founded in 1990 by Andrew Heller, a principal designer of the original IBM POWER architecture. His idea was to build computers based on a RISC architecture for the commercial market. The inspiration of the name comes from the Arthur C. Clarke novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

The company&#x27;s intent to develop a high-performance microprocessor implementing the SPARC architecture prompted Fujitsu to fund the company in 1991. $40.2 million was invested in return for a 44% stake. As part of the deal:
# Fujitsu agreed to not increase their ownership of HAL.
# Fujitsu would fabricate HAL&#x27;s microprocessor designs.
# Fujitsu would make its patents available to HAL.
# Fujitsu would manufacture some of the HAL machines, and market them in Asia. 
In return, HAL gave Fujitsu access to the technology it was developing. By this time, HAL had 140 employees. 

In mid-1993, Heller resigned from his position as chairman and chief executive officer to become a consultant to Fujitsu Ltd. HAL said Heller had been developing roadmaps for Fujitsu and its subsidiaries ICL plc and Amdahl Corporation for the six months prior to his resignation, and had been less involved with HAL&#x27;s daily operation. There were suggestions that Fujitsu was dissatisfied with HAL&#x27;s progress and their failure to introduce systems with their 64-bit processor, but the company had no comment on the suggestions. The position of president was taken by Scott Metcalf, who was also the chief operating officer.

In November 1993, Fujitsu paid more than $50 million for the remaining 56% of HAL it did not own. HAL became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu.

HAL was very secretive about their product plans during their operation as an independent company. Initial systems were intended for a 1994 launch.

The company produced multiple generations of computers based on microprocessors they had designed to the 64-bit SPARC V9 specification. Their processor design, known as SPARC64, combined out-of-order execution with mainframe-style reliability, availability and serviceability features. SPARC64 beat out Sun Microsystems&#x27; UltraSPARC I by a few months to be the first SPARC V9 microprocessor produced.

Most of the sales of the company went to the Japanese market. Fujitsu closed the subsidiary in mid-2001.

HAL later designed the SPARC64 II (previously known as the SPARC64+), SPARC64 III microprocessors. They also designed a microprocessor that was canceled when the division was closed by Fujitsu, known as the SPARC64 V. Fujitsu would later develop a microprocessor with the same name.

== HAL Software Systems ==
HAL Software Systems was HAL&#x27;s software division. Their first product was a Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) management tool. Later products, introduced in March 1994, included the Olias Browser, Olias Build Tools, Olias Remote Information Broker, and Olias Filter Development Kit. These products were for browsing and managing Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and World Wide Web documents and relational databases. In mid-1996, Fujitsu had HAL Computer Systems spin off HAL Software Systems as Chisholm Technologies, Inc., a company financed by Fujitsu that developed Intranet administration tools.

<text>Kumar Ram Narain Karthikeyan (; born 14 January 1977) is an Indian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and .

== Early life and family background ==
Karthikeyan was born on 14 January 1977 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu to Sheela and Kakarla Karthikeyan Naidu. He has an elder sister, Deepika and younger brother, Rajeev. He did his schooling at Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Coimbatore. His interest in motorsport began at an early age, as his father Karthikeyan, was a former Indian national rally champion winning South India Rally seven times.

He went on the Elf Winfield Racing School in France, and became a semifinalist in the Pilote Elf Competition for Formula Renault cars in 1992.

== Early career ==
Narain finished on the podium in his first race at Sriperumbudur in a Formula Maruti National racing championship. Then, he went to France and attended the Elf Winfield Racing School. He returned to India to race in Formula Maruti for the 1993 season at the age of 15 years, and in the same year, he also competed in the Formula Vauxhall Junior championship in Great Britain.

He previously competed in A1GP, and the Le Mans Series. He has won multiple races in A1GP, British F3, World series by Nissan, AutoGP, Formula Asia, British Formula Ford and Opel series in his single-seater career. He won the British Formula Ford Winter Series in 1994 and Formula Asia Championship in 1996.

In 1994, he returned to the UK, racing in the Formula Ford Zetec series as the number two works Vector driver for the Foundation Racing team. The highlight of the season was a podium finish in a support race for the Portuguese Grand Prix held at Estoril. He also took part in the British Formula Ford Winter Series, and became the first Indian driver to win any championship in Europe.

In 1995, Karthikeyan graduated to the Formula Asia Championship for just four races. However, he showed pace immediately and was able to finish second in the race at Shah Alam, Malaysia. In 1996, he had a full season in the series and became the first Indian and the first Asian to win the Formula Asia International series. He moved back to Britain in 1997 to compete in the British Formula Opel Championship with the Nemesis Motorsport team, taking a pole position and win at Donington Park and finishing sixth in the overall points standings.

In 1998, Karthikeyan made his debut in the British Formula 3 Championship with the Carlin Motorsport team. Competing in only 10 rounds, he managed two third-place finishes in the final two races of the season, at Spa-Francorchamps and Silverstone, to finish 12th overall. He continued in the championship for 1999, finishing on the podium five times, including two wins at Brands Hatch. His season also included two pole positions, three fastest laps and two lap records, helping him to sixth in the championship. He also competed in the Macau Grand Prix, qualifying in sixth position and finishing sixth in the second race. He was the first racing driver to record a win for Carlin in British F3 ever since then Carlin have been invincible in terms of race wins in the British F3 Championship. Continuing his drive in the British F3 Championship in 2000, he finished fourth overall in the standings, and also took pole position and fastest laps in the Macau Grand Prix. He also won both the International F3 race at Spa-Francorchamps and the Korea Super Prix.

Karthikeyan started 2001 in the Formula Nippon F3000 Championship, finishing the year amongst the top ten. In the same year, he became the first Indian to ever drive a Formula One car, testing for the Jaguar Racing team at Silverstone on 14 June. Impressed with his performance, he was then offered a test drive in the Jordan-Honda EJ11 at Silverstone in September. Karthikeyan again tested for Jordan, at Mugello in Italy on 5 October, finishing just half a second off the pace off Jordan&#x27;s lead driver Jean Alesi.

In 2002, he moved into the Telefónica World Series with Team Tata RC Motorsport, taking a pole position and setting the fastest non-Formula One lap time at the Interlagos Circuit in Brazil. Continuing in the renamed Superfund World Series in 2003, Karthikeyan got four podium finishes on his way to fourth overall in the championship. These results earned him another Formula One test drive, this time with the Minardi team. He was offered a race drive for the 2004 season, but was unable to raise the necessary sponsorship funds to seal the deal.

He continued in the Nissan World Series in 2004, taking wins in Valencia, Spain and Magny-Cours, France, and finished 6th in the standings, and also made a single appearance in the FIA GT Championship for Scuderia Veregra, partnering Anthony Beltoise and Maktoum Hasher Al Maktoum at the Dubai 500km, finishing 11th in class and 19th overall.

==Formula One career==

===Jordan (2005)===
On 1 February 2005, Karthikeyan announced that he had signed a preliminary deal with the Jordan Formula One team and said that he would be their main driver for the 2005 Formula One season, making him India&#x27;s first Formula One racing driver. His partner was Portuguese driver Tiago Monteiro. Karthikeyan completed the necessary testing distance of 300 km in an F1 car in order to gain his superlicence at the Silverstone Circuit on 10 February.

In his first race, the Australian Grand Prix, Karthikeyan qualified in 12th position. After a poor start which saw him drop to 18th place by the end of the first lap, he finished in 15th, two laps behind winner Giancarlo Fisichella. He achieved his only points in the 2005 United States Grand Prix where all but three teams pulled out due to an argument over tyre safety. He finished fourth, finishing ahead of the two Minardi drivers but behind teammate Monteiro. Apart from the USGP, his highest finish was 11th place. In the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix free practice, he was fastest for a long period and eventually qualified 11th. At the 2005 Chinese Grand Prix he qualified in 15th place. In an unlucky end to his 2005 season, Karthikeyan crashed his Jordan into a wall at the Chinese race, but was unhurt and able to provide an interview afterwards.

Because the Jordan team was taken over and renamed Midland for the 2006 season, the management change prompted some doubt over Karthikeyan&#x27;s future at the team. Near the end of 2005, he announced he would not be driving for Midland the following year allegedly due to their demand that he pay as much as $11.7 million to secure his seat on the team.

On 8 December 2005, Karthikeyan tested for Williams at Spain and finished fifth, outpacing the confirmed Williams second driver, Nico Rosberg, who finished ninth. On 27 January 2006, Williams confirmed Karthikeyan as their fourth driver. He was to perform testing duties for the team alongside Alexander Wurz who had been confirmed earlier as the team&#x27;s third driver. He was retained as a reserve test driver for Williams alongside Kazuki Nakajima in 2007. Karthikeyan said he was &quot;blown away&quot; by the difference between Formula One&#x27;s stragglers and a top-flight team.

He was a Williams F1 test driver in and . 

Like several other former F1 drivers, Karthikeyan moved to stock car racing and drove the No. 60 Safe Auto Insurance Company Toyota Tundra for Wyler Racing in the 2010 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.

===HRT (2011–2012)===
Later in 2007, he was linked with the Spyker (previously Jordan) Formula One team after their driver Christijan Albers was fired, although Sakon Yamamoto got the drive. Due to the withdrawal of support of Williams F1 by Tata (Karthikeyan&#x27;s main sponsor), Nakajima was given the lion&#x27;s share of testing duties and Karthikeyan was sidelined.

When the Spyker F1 team was bought out by Vijay Mallya towards the end of 2007, Karthikeyan had been linked with a drive with the new Force India Formula One team in 2008. However, he did not even get to test for the team. He was also linked to a drive with the Super Aguri team in January 2008, as one of the terms of an Indian consortium investing in the team. The deal was not agreed and he continued to drive for A1 Team India. He was India&#x27;s only Formula One driver until the 2010 season, when Karun Chandhok signed to drive for the Hispania Racing F1 Team.

==== 2011 ====

On 6 January 2011, Karthikeyan announced that he would drive for the Hispania team in the season, following five years away from active involvement in the championship. He confirmed the deal via his Twitter page, saying it would be a &quot;dream come true to race in front of the home crowd in the Indian GP in October,&quot; and adding that the support of financial backers Tata Group had been &quot;instrumental&quot;.

Driving for a small team, along with the increasing reliability of modern Formula 1 cars, meant that Karthikeyan twice set the record for the lowest placed finisher in a Formula 1 event. The first occurrence was during the Chinese Grand Prix where the single retirement of Jaime Alguersuari meant Karthikeyan finished in 23rd place, after he was overtaken by teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi on the final lap. However, in the European Grand Prix there were no retirements meaning that Karthikeyan once again broke the record by being the 24th car to cross the finish line.

On 30 June 2011, Karthikeyan was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo for the remaining races of the season except the Indian Grand Prix but participated in Friday first practice in Germany, Singapore, Japan and Korea.

On 23 October 2011, it was confirmed that Karthikeyan would replace Liuzzi for the Indian Grand Prix. Karthikeyan was outqualifed by 0.022 secs to qualify 22nd, however he started 24th and last due to blocking Michael Schumacher in qualifying. Despite picking up damage in the first lap of the race, Karthikeyan managed to beat Ricciardo by 31.8 seconds in the race to finish 17th. Liuzzi returned to replace Karthikeyan ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

==== 2012 ====

On 3 February 2012, it was confirmed that Karthikeyan had again signed for the HRT team for the 2012 season partnering Pedro de la Rosa.
In the Australian Grand Prix, he and teammate Pedro de la Rosa were unable to qualify. In Malaysia, both the HRTs managed to qualify, with Karthikeyan starting 23rd due to a 5-place gear box penalty for Heikki Kovalainen, the start was wet and the HRTs gambled to start the race on full wet tyres, whilst the other cars started on intermediate tyres. As the rain increased that gamble paid off as other cars had to pit for full wets which promoted Karthikeyan to a points-paying tenth place before the safety car then red flag came out for heavy rain. At the restart, after a few more laps behind the safety car, the track was dry enough for intermediate tyres and a few drivers pitted as the safety car came back in, however Karthikeyan stayed out and was as high as 5th place at one point, before McLaren&#x27;s Jenson Button crashed into him whilst they were racing for position. Karthikeyan suffered damage however, but he pitted for intermediate tyres which dropped him to the back of the field, bar teammate de la Rosa who had a served a drive-through penalty. On lap 47, Red Bull&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel received a puncture after hitting Karthikeyan&#x27;s front wing, whilst lapping him and Vettel was forced to pit and replaced the punctured tyre which put Vettel down from 4th place, finishing 11th; Karthikeyan finished the race in 21st, however he was given a 20-second post-race penalty for his part in the collision, which meant he dropped to 22nd and last, behind de la Rosa.

Post-race, Vettel and Red Bull boss Christian Horner criticised Karthikeyan&#x27;s driving, with Vettel calling Karthikeyan an &quot;idiot&quot;. Karthikeyan hit back at Vettel, calling him a &quot;cry-baby&quot;. Later, Kartikeyan decided to call a truce with Vettel, stating his respect for Vettel&#x27;s abilities and saying &quot;I think we have to deal with it in a mature way and forget about it.&quot;

Kartikeyan qualified last for the following five races (bar in Spain where Lewis Hamilton was excluded from qualifying and in Monaco where Sergio Pérez crashed without setting a time) however he started 24th and last twice (in Bahrain and Canada) due to other drivers picking up grid penalties. In China he finished 22nd, ahead of Caterham&#x27;s Heikki Kovalainen. In Bahrain, he finished 21st and was classified ahead of the Williams of Bruno Senna who retired due to brake issues. In Spain he retired after a wheel nut failure on lap 22 due to a botched pit stop. In Monaco he started 22nd, ahead of Perez and the penalised Pastor Maldonado and finished the race in 15th, classified ahead of McLaren&#x27;s Jenson Button who retired after collision damage with Kovalainen. In Canada he retired for the second time in the season after suffering a brake failure on lap 22 which made him spin in turn 1 and stop later on in the lap. His teammate Pedro de la Rosa retired with a similar issue two laps later.

At the European Grand Prix Karthikeyan for the first time in the season qualified 22nd, ahead of the Marussia of Charles Pic, with Timo Glock missing qualifying and the race due to illness. He finished the race in 18th, behind Pic and de la Rosa but classified ahead of Lewis Hamilton who retired after crashing out with two laps remaining. He finished the next 3 races as the final classified finisher before retiring in Hungary due to broken suspension. He qualified last in Belgium, before running as high as 13th during the race, with good pace, before crashing out on lap 30 in broken suspension. He out-qualified his teammate de la Rosa for the first time this year at Monza, but ended up finishing behind him in 19th. He out-qualified him again at Singapore, this time by over a second, but crashed out at turn 16 on lap 30.

Karthikeyan qualified in 24th at Suzuka, having crashed in practice and therefore having to use an old-spec chassis floor. He was running ahead of Pic and de la Rosa for quite some time until retiring with vibrations on lap 32. He did a one-stop strategy in Korea and finished last in 20th, almost a lap behind Pic in 19th. In India he once again finished last, running with minor wing damage from a collision at the first corner. He retired in spectacular fashion on lap 9 in Abu Dhabi after his steering broke and he was rear-ended by Nico Rosberg. He qualified 24th in Austin amid fears that both he and his teammate would be outside the 107% time after struggling to heat the tyres in practice on the brand-new circuit, and then finished last in 22nd, also being accused by Vettel of holding him up when being lapped and allowing Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He qualified 23rd in Brazil and peaked as high as 11th during the incident-packed opening stint of the race. He eventually dropped back and finished last in 18th. He finished the season in 24th, with zero points.

From 2014–2018, Karthikeyan raced in Japanese Super Formula series. In 2019, he ended his single-seater career by joining Super GT series in Japan.

==Other events and races==

===IRL test===
In 2005, Karthikeyan tested an Indy Racing League (IRL) car for the Red Bull Cheever Racing team for the Indianapolis 500 race and was offered $500,000 as an initial fee, but the deal was not completed.

===A1 GP===
In 2007 season Karthikeyan also drove for A1 Team India. He made his A1 GP debut in New Zealand and he finished 10th in the sprint race and 7th in the Feature Race.
Karthikeyan won the A1GP of Zhuhai (China) for Team India on 16 December 2007.
This was India&#x27;s first A1GP win.
Karthikeyan is also the first to take pole position for India in the A1GP. He got pole in the feature race in Brands Hatch in 2008.
Karthikeyan won two feature races in the 2007–2008 season, including the season finale at Brands Hatch starting from pole position. This helped India finish in the top ten, ahead of such as Australia, Brazil, China and Italy.

The 4th season for Team India was disastrous as the team lost its title sponsor, which resulted in severe financial constraints. On 3 May 2009 A1 Team India finished the season with a podium finish in the Sprint Race at Brands Hatch. Karthikeyan qualified the A1 Team India car in 7th place on the starting grid for the race. The Feature Race ended abruptly for Karthikeyan, as he was taken out by the spinning car of A1 Team China in front of him on the first corner of the first lap.

The team finished 12th overall in the 2008–09 season.

===24 Hours of Le Mans===
In the second week of March 2009, Karthikeyan tested for the Kolles Le Mans Team. It was later confirmed that for the 2009 season, he would be partnered by Charles Zwolsman, Jr. and Andrew Meyrick. Team Kolles – headed by ex-Jordan, Midland and Force India Team Principal Colin Kolles – took part in the championship with two Audi R10 turbo diesel machines. The car boasted a successful racing history with three Le Mans 24h victories and 22 individual race wins to its name. Team Kolles joined the championship for the first time in 2009.

On 11 May 2009, Karthikeyan finished sixth in his first ever Le Mans series race while driving for the Kolles Audi team in the second round of the 2009 championship held at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium.
On 14 June 2009 Karthikeyan dislocated his shoulder in a fall just before the start of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He had come up with strong performances in the practice and the qualifying, and was scheduled to do the opening double stint. At 1:00 am the ACO organisation declared him unsuitable to drive, even though the Audi doctor approved it.

===NASCAR===
Karthikeyan made his NASCAR debut at Martinsville Speedway on 27 March 2010 driving in the Kroger 250 Camping World Truck Series for Wyler Racing in the #60 Safe Auto Insurance Company Chevrolet Silverado. Qualifying was rained out and the field set by 2009 owner points, putting the first Indian-born driver to compete in NASCAR in the 11th starting spot. After a slow start and coming to grips with driving a race truck and racing on an American oval short track for the first time, Karthikeyan did manage to put in a very respectable effort and finished on the lead lap in 13th place. Karthikeyan went on to win the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Most Popular Driver Award for the 2010 season which was voted by the fans, becoming the first foreign-born driver to win the award.

===Superleague Formula===
Karthikeyan drove for the PSV Eindhoven team in SLF in 2010. He won the 2nd race at Brands Hatch, Great Britain and finished 16th in the Championship on 288 points, taking part in six of the twelve race weekends.
===Auto GP===
Karthikeyan drove for Zele Racing and Super Nova Racing in the Auto GP series in 2013. After switching from Zele Racing to Super Nova Racing, in the latter part of the series, he won 5 races and secure 4 pole positions and in the process finished 4th in the championship &amp; became the highest points scorer in the second half of the season.

===Super Formula===
In 2014, Karthikeyan returned to the Japanese Top Formula series Super Formula for the first time since 2001 with the same Team IMPUL. In the 2015 season, Karthikeyan moved to Honda-powered Docomo Team Dandelion. Karthikeyan moved to Sunoco Team LeMans for the 2016 season after DoCoMo Dandelion Racing chose McLaren Honda F1 Reserve Stoffel Vandoorne.

===Super GT===
In 2019, Karthikeyan raced with Nakajima Racing for one race, winning the Fuji Super GT x DTM Dream Race in Fuji, gaining the fastest lap during the race. He then raced with Modulo Epson NSX-GT Team for 8 races, gaining one podium.

== Awards ==
The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 2010.

<doc id="987274" wikidata="Q433615" url="?curid=987274" title="Indalecio Prieto">
<text>Indalecio Prieto Tuero (30 April 1883 – 11 February 1962) was a Spanish politician, a minister and one of the leading figures of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) in the years before and during the Second Spanish Republic. Less radical than Francisco Largo Caballero, Prieto served as minister under his government during the Spanish Civil War. Exiled in Mexico after the republican defeat, he led the Socialist Party from 1948 to 1951.

==Early life==
Born in Oviedo in 1883, he was six years old when his father died. His mother moved him to Bilbao in 1891. From a young age, he survived by selling magazines in the street. He eventually obtained work as a stenographer at the daily newspaper &quot;La Voz de Vizcaya&quot;, which led to a position as a copy editor and later a journalist at the rival daily &quot;El Liberal.&quot; He eventually became the director and owner of the newspaper.

In 1899, at the age of 16, he had joined the PSOE. As a journalist in the first decade of the 20th century, Prieto became a leading figure of socialism in the Basque Country.

==Entering politics==
Spain&#x27;s neutrality in World War I greatly benefited Spanish industry and commerce, but those benefits were not reflected in the workers&#x27; salaries. The period was one of great social unrest, culminating on August 13, 1917, in a revolutionary general strike. The government&#x27;s fear of unrest like that of the February Revolution that year in Russia (the October Revolution there was still to come) caused it to use the military to put down the general strike. Members of the strike committee were arrested in Madrid. Having been involved in organizing the strike, Prieto fled to France before he could be arrested.

He did not return until April 1918, when he had been elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies. Very critical of the actions of the government and army during the Rif War, or &quot;War of Melilla&quot; (1919–1926), Prieto spoke out strongly in the Congress after the Battle of Annual (1921). He also addressed the likely responsibility of the king in the imprudent military actions of General Manuel Fernández Silvestre in the Melilla command zone.

Prieto was opposed to Francisco Largo Caballero&#x27;s line of partial collaboration with the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. He had bitter confrontations with both men.

In August 1930, despite the opposition of party leader Julián Besteiro Fernández, Prieto participated in the Pact of San Sebastián. The broad coalition of republican parties proposed doing away with the Spanish monarchy. In that matter, Prieto was supported by Largo Caballero&#x27;s wing of the party, as the latter believed that the fall of the monarchy was necessary so that socialism could rise to power.

==Second Spanish Republic==
When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed on April 14, 1931, Prieto was named finance minister in the provisional government, presided by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora.

As Minister of Public Works in the 1931–1933 government of Manuel Azaña, he continued and expanded the policy of hydroelectric projects that had been begun during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, as well as the ambitious plan of infrastructural improvements in Madrid, such as the new Chamartín railway station and the tunnel under Madrid linking it to Atocha railway station. Most of those works that would not be completed until after the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War.

Unlike Largo Caballero, he opposed the general strike and the failed armed rising in October 1934, but he again fled to France to escape possible prosecution. Before the republic, Prieto had arguably maintained a more radical line than Largo Caballero, but he would now be identified as a relative moderate and opposed Largo Caballero&#x27;s more revolutionary tendency.

Prieto gave a thrilling campaign speech in Cuenca on 1 May 1936, prior to the 3 May repetition of the February 1936 election in the district in which the Popular Front would face among the right-wing rival José Antonio Primo de Rivera and, after the resignation of General Francisco Franco as candidate, Manuel Casanova. He brought Regenerationist memories and proposed Keynesian measures to develop the domestic market of the country. In words directed towards the firebrand faction of Largo Cabrello, Prieto asked for moderation, discipline and the disregarding of revolutionary excesses that would put the democratic government in peril. The speech in which Prieto also displayed a deep sense of patriotism (he claimed to &quot;carry Spain within his heart&quot; and &quot;in the marrow of his bones&quot;) was celebrated by the republican press, and it was received well even by José Antonio, then in prison. However, it was met with hostility among the radicals, deepening the rupture within the party.

==Assassination attempt==
On 31 May 1936, Prieto was shot at a socialist rally in Ecija.

==Spanish Civil War==
After the beginning of the Civil War, when news of the ruthless and systematic executions of Loyalists by the Nationalists, as part of General Mola&#x27;s policy of instilling terror in their ranks, began to filter to the areas held by the government, Prieto made a fervent plea to Spanish republicans on 8 August in a radiocast:

However, a couple of weeks after those words, the Modelo Massacre took place in Madrid, much to the dismay of many Popular Front leaders. Saddened, Prieto is recorded as expressing his pessimism with these words: &quot;with this brutality we have lost the war&quot;. However, historian Julius Ruiz argues that Prieto was not necessarily a steadfast moderate, as he held that Republican victory would require stripping the Church, capitalists and army of their power as they were deemed collectively responsible for the rebellion. In August 1936, Prieto also stated that Republican terror was unnecessary because their internal opponents were already cowed and that Nationalist terror was because of their relative weakness.

In September 1936, after the fall of Talavera de la Reina, in Toledo Province, to the rebels, Largo Caballero became the head of the government, and Prieto became Minister of Marine and Air.

After the May 3–8, 1937 events in Barcelona in which the communists and the government forces tried to establish control over the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), the government of Largo Caballero was replaced by that of Juan Negrín, with Prieto being Minister of Defense. Lacking support from the democratic powers, such as France, the United Kingdom and the United States, the Spanish Republic was subject to severe international isolation during Prieto&#x27;s last ministry in Spain. Maritime access for Soviet material aid was effectively cut off by the attacks of Italian submarines, and the French border remained closed.

After the defeat of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces on the northern front in October 1937, he offered his resignation, which was rejected. Prieto finally left the government after the March 1938 defeat on the Aragon front after an escalating dispute with the communists.

==Exile==

He refrained from active political life for the remainder of the war, exiling himself to Mexico. In 1945, toward the end of World War II, he was one of those who attempted to form a republican government-in-exile and hoped to reach an accord with the monarchist opposition to Francisco Franco, the ruler of Spain since the end of the Civil War, with a view to restoring Spanish democracy. The failure of that initiative led to his definitive retirement from active politics. He died in Mexico City in 1962.

In Mexico, he wrote several books, such as &quot;Palabras al viento&quot; (&quot;Words in the Wind&quot;, 1942), &quot;Discursos en América&quot; (&quot;Discourses in America&quot;, 1944) and at the end of his life, &quot;Cartas a un escultor: pequeños detalles de grandes sucesos&quot; (&quot;Letters to a Sculptor: Small Details of Great events&quot;, 1962).

== Positions ==
Supporting of the notion of further devolution to the Basque Provinces and Navarra, Prieto was greatly opposed to separatism as well as towards the plans of the Basque nationalists in the draft of the Estella Statute, fearing the prospect of the territory becoming a &quot;reactionary Gibraltar and a clerical stronghold&quot;.

<doc id="987314" wikidata="Q6942275" url="?curid=987314" title="Music of Singapore">
<text>Singapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from rock and pop to folk and classical. Its various communities have their own distinct musical traditions: the Chinese form the largest ethnic group in Singapore, with Malays, Indians as well as a lesser number of other peoples of different ethnicities including Eurasians. The different people with their traditional forms of music, the various modern musical styles, and the fusion of different forms account for the musical diversity in the country.

It has an urban musical scene, and is a center for pop, rock, punk and other genres in the region. The country has produced in the 1960s bands like The Crescendos and The Quests, right up to the new millennium with pop singers such as Stefanie Sun and JJ Lin. Folk music of Singapore includes the ethnic music traditions of the Chinese, Malay and Tamil communities. Singapore also has a lively Western classical music scene.

==Popular music==
Singapore has been a regional centre of music industry for a long time. Recordings of Chinese and Malay popular music were done at the EMI studio in Singapore in the colonial period, but until the 1960s, recordings were sent to be pressed in India and the records then sent back for sale. It was a centre of Malay popular culture where Malay stars such as P. Ramlee were based, but after Singapore independence in 1965, the Malay music industry began to shift to Kuala Lumpur.

===Malay popular music===
In the 1960s, local bands in Singapore were inspired by Western groups such as Blue Diamonds, Cliff Richard &amp; the Shadows, and The Beatles. Popular groups of the period included The Crescendos who performed in English with hit songs like &quot;Mr Twister&quot;, The Quests who had hits like &quot;Shanty&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song&quot;, &quot;Jesamine&quot; and &quot;Mr Rainbow&quot;, as well as other pop-rock bands including The Thunderbirds, The Trailers, The Crescendos, The Western Union Band, October Cherries and The Silver Strings. A Malay genre influenced by British rock and pop called Pop Yeh-Yeh emerged in the 1960s. The bands performed in the Malay language, although some may also performed in English or were instrumental.

Malay pop bands of the 1960s included Naomi &amp; the Boys who produced a household hit song &quot;Happy Happy Birthday Baby&quot;, D&#x27;4 Ever, Antarctics, Mike Ibrahim &amp; the Nite Walkers, Swallows, Ismail Haron &amp; the Guys, and Les Kafila&#x27;s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the rise of rock bands such as Sweet Charity fronted by the vocalist Ramli Sarip. The band had such an influence in the Singapore and Malaysia music scene that it later led to a rock explosion in the mid 1980s.

===Chinese popular music===
Singapore also emerged as a centre of local Chinese recording industry in the 1960s, producing Chinese pop music in Mandarin with local singers. From the 60s to the 80s, local stars such as Chang Siao Ying (張小英), Sakura Teng (樱花), Rita Chao (凌雲), and Lena Lim (林竹君) were popular in Singapore and Malaysia. A few, such as Lena Lim, also had some success outside the region.

The pop music industry thrived by the 1980s, with several recording companies producing Chinese records by local as well as Taiwanese singers. Starting in the mid 1980s, a genre of Mandarin ballads called &quot;xinyao&quot; began to emerge with singers and/or songwriters such as Liang Wern Fook, Lee Shih Shiong, and Billy Koh. Local music labels such as Ocean Butterflies International and Hype Records were established. From the 1990s onwards, many Singaporean singers such as Kit Chan, Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Tanya Chua, Corrinne May, Fann Wong, and Mavis Hee had achieved wider success outside of Singapore.

===English popular music===
There are also a number artists from Singapore who work primarily in the English language, some such as singer-songwriter Sophie Koh are active outside of Singapore. In the 2010s, Singapore has seen a rise in home-grown acts like Charlie Lim, The Sam Willows, Gentle Bones, The Steve McQueens, Pleasantry, MYRNE, HubbaBubbas, Sam Rui, Leon Markcus, Scarlet Avenue and Nathan Hartono.

==Ethnic traditions==

===Chinese===

There are speakers of various dialects amongst the Chinese population, such as Hokkien, Hakka, Cantonese, and Teochew, and different dialect speakers may have their own clan associations which support their respective forms of opera. Opera troupes were first formed by amateur music clubs; the earliest amateur music club in Singapore is the Er Woo Amateur Music &amp; Dramatic Association (馀娱儒乐社) set up in 1912 by Teochew businessmen, initially to promote music of the Hakkas (&quot;Hanju&quot; opera and &quot;Handiao&quot; music), later also Teochew opera. A number of recordings of &quot;Hanju&quot; opera performed by Er Woo were made in the 1920s and 1930s. Many professional and amateur opera troupes that performed in various dialects were later established. These opera troupes typically perform during festivals and national events, and may also hold regular small-scale performances, or large-scale ones annually or biannually. The professional troupes may also perform in opera theatres. During Chinese festivities there was also a minstrel tradition called &quot;zouchang&quot; (walk-sing), which involves walking performance by members of the operatic troupes. In the past, makeshift stages often appeared during festivities along the streets where operas may be performed. However, operas have declined as popular entertainment in the latter half of the 20th century; opera theatres closed, and street opera have mostly been replaced by &quot;getai&quot; where modern songs and comedy routines are performed, although street opera is still performed by professional and amateur opera troupes.
Many music organisations and ensembles devoted to Chinese music or Huayue were established in the 1950s, and there are now many full-sized Chinese orchestras in Singapore. The first Chinese orchestra was formed in 1959 by the Thau Yong Amateur Musical Association (陶融儒乐社), which was established in 1931 by former members of Er Woo. The Singapore Chinese Orchestra is the only professional Chinese orchestra in Singapore, however amateur Chinese orchestras formed by clan associations, community centres and schools are common, with over 150 amateur Chinese orchestras formed. There are also chamber ensembles such as those of the Nanguan tradition from Siong Leng Musical Association. Drumming performances which accompany the traditional Lion Dance are also popular.

===Malay===
Music genres popular in neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, such as &quot;Dondang Sayang&quot; and &quot;Keroncong&quot;, were also popular among Malays in Singapore. Vocal performances accompanied by &quot;kompang&quot; and &quot;hadrah&quot; drums are among the most popular types of Malay music in Singapore, and may be performed during weddings and official functions. Other vocal genres such as &quot;dikir barat&quot; and &quot;ghazal&quot; are also popular. An old tradition of Malay opera called &quot;Bangsawan&quot; existed since the 19th century but had declined, although there are modern attempts at reviving the genre.

===Indian===
Hindustani and Karnatic music are two forms of Indian classical music that may be found in Singapore. Other forms of music that are popular are &quot;Bhajan&quot; and &quot;Bhangra&quot; music, and professional Bhangra troupes may perform at festivities and special events.

===Peranakan===
The Peranakans are descendants of early Chinese immigrants who had intermarried with the local Malay population, and had adopted, partly or fully, Malay customs. Their folk music is noted for its fusion of English in Malay-inspired tunes, largely because the Peranakans themselves are often conversant in both languages. Contemporary tunes continue to be composed based on the Peranakan culture, such as &quot;Bunga Sayang&quot; composed in 1994, a theme song from Dick Lee&#x27;s musical &quot;Kampung Amber&quot;. The song became an often-sung staple of the National Day Parade, and gained international exposure when it was performed for the opening ceremony of the 117th IOC Session at the Esplanade.

==Western classical music==

Western classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, and at its center is the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) which was instituted in 1979. The main performance venue for the orchestra is the Esplanade Concert Hall, but it also performs in Victoria Concert Hall and gives the occasional free performances in parks. Other notable orchestras in Singapore include Singapore National Youth Orchestra which is funded by the Ministry of Education, the community-based Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra, The Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra of the Music Makers, and National University of Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Many orchestras and ensembles are also found in secondary schools and junior colleges.

There are a few opera companies that present Western operas in Singapore: Singapore Lyric Opera which was founded in 1991, and New Opera Singapore established in 2011. There is also a lively local chamber music scene, which took off in 2007. A number of significant changes in the early 2000s boosted the development of the classical music scene in Singapore, in particular the building of the performing arts venue Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, and the establishment of the first conservatory of Singapore, Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music.

Well-known classical musicians from Singapore include Lynnette Seah, Lim Soon Lee, Siow Lee Chin, Abigail Sin and Mikkel Myer Lee. Some, such as conductor Darrell Ang and Vanessa-Mae, are expat working overseas, there are however an increasing number of local musicians who are actively involved in the classical music scene of Singapore. Some of these classical musicians have ventured into other genres and taken their music to public places, such as the Lorong Boys, who sometimes perform in MRT trains.

==Rock music==

Alternative and indie rock music influenced bands in the 1990s such as Concave Scream, Humpback Oak, The Padres, Oddfellows, Astreal, and Livionia. In the Pop/Rock genres were &quot;KICK!&quot;, Lizard&#x27;s Convention &amp; Radio Active. According to a 1992 Straits Times report, in that year, 15 other albums were released on independent labels and around 200 local bands were writing their own music. The following year, songs by The Padres, CU1359, ESP and The Oddfellows were featured on Multitrack 3, a British Broadcasting Corporation radio programme.

Recently, alternative, metal, grindcore, punk rock and rock acts from Singapore who gained some profile outside Singapore include Analog Girl, Amateur Takes Control, Cockpit, John Klass, Firebrands, Stompin&#x27; Ground, Ling Kai, Inch Chua, Ronin, PsychoSonique, Anna Judge April, Electrico, Force Vomit, The Observatory, 4-Sides, Vermillion, West Grand Boulevard, Plainsunset, Etc., sub:shaman, Caracal, Popland, The Great Spy Experiment, Sky In Euphoria, Rancour, Saw Loser (formerly known as Pug Jelly), Gorbachev, Helga, Malex, A Vacant Affair, For Better Endings, Death Metal and Rudra, who are significant for creating the genre &quot;Vedic Metal&quot;.

===Metal===

Metal has a small but not insignificant presence in Singapore&#x27;s music scene. Many metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Exodus, Morbid Angel, Slayer, Dream Theater and Helloween made Singapore a stop in their tour, at venues such as Fort Canning Park and Singapore Indoor Stadium. Small to medium scale gigs are held almost weekly at locations such as BlackHole212 or The Substation. Most recently, on 15 February 2011, Iron Maiden played to a crowd of 12,000 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

There have also been many notable local metal bands from many varying subgenres in the growing underground scene. Special mention includes:

* Black metal stalwarts Impiety,
* Extreme Metal veterans Rudra who created a new metal genre called Vedic Metal and a cult following worldwide. The band has also attracted the attention of Musicologists. Several papers have been published about Vedic Metal and the band.
*Bastardized: Pioneer Doom Melodic Death metal band existing since 1993. &quot;With Love, With Hate, With Grief, With Pain.&quot; EP released under Valentine Sound Productions 1994. Poetry styled album &quot;The Over Burdened&quot; expected release in 2016.
*Funeral Hearse signed by prominent American Metal Label Redefining Darkness Records, owned by Thomas Haywood of Aborted and Abigail Williams fame.
* Wormrot have been signed to the UK record label Earache Records since 2010.
*Local Death Metal &quot;Assault&quot; band new album &quot;The Fallen Reich&quot; features current Taiwan member of Parliament &amp; &quot;ChthoniC&quot; Frontman Freddy Lim and Maldive metal band &quot;Nothnegal&quot; Guitarist Fufu.

There is however little support for metal in Singapore&#x27;s mainstream media. The heavy metal scene in Singapore therefore has established its own ways of disseminating information by utilizing popular internet based social mediums such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs.

Some Metal music of this generation may be featured occasionally on Brader Bo&#x27;s show, Vicious Volume of RIA 89.7fm.

===Experimental/Improvised===

Two Singapore rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, Heritage and Zircon Lounge, showed tendencies to create music beyond conventional rock idioms. In the late 1980s, Corporate Toil baited audiences with noisy electronic performances influenced by industrial/new wave bands like Suicide or Einstürzende Neubauten. In the 1990s, Kelvin Tan produced literally dozens of albums of avant folk and improvised guitar, as well as assembling the short-lived Stigmata featuring bassist Ian Woo and saxophonist Kelvin Guoh. Zai Kuning, largely known as a visual artist and dancer, lived for a period in Japan and collaborated musically with Tetsu Saitoh, a famed Japanese cellist. Zai also created his own form of Malay folk and gypsy blues music, singing incantations in his deep tenor while playing a loose form of open tuning guitar.

By the late 1990s and into the 2000s, a group of experimental laptop artists appeared: George Chua, Yuen Chee Wai, Evan Tan, Ang Song Ming, and Chong Li-Chuan, the last having received the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in music at Goldsmiths College, University of London. Straddling the world of digital effects and acoustic instruments was the duo aspidistrafly, who eventually gained an enormous following in Japan, producing their own music and running their Kitchen. Label. The Observatory, a supergroup formed from the ashes of Leslie Low&#x27;s folk rock Humpback Oak trio, have been widely regarded as one of the best bands in Singapore, with Yeow Kai Chai of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; writing, &quot;No other Singapore band, past or present, has captured the imagination quite like The Observatory.&quot; 

Musical outsiders Engineered Beautiful Blood (Shark Fung and Wei Nan) blazed a hot trail of no wave improvised rock, then stopped playing in 2009. However, their members eventually formed a larger improvised rock ensemble, I\D, which itself would splinter off into smaller groups and configurations. Shark Fung himself has been a key figure in the musical margins, with his idiosyncratic solo drums-and-electronics noise outfit Awk Wah, and forming the collective structured improv group BALBALAB with Wu Jun Han, Dennis Tan and Zai Tang in late 2014. Around the middle of the 2000s, another grouping calling themselves Under the Velvet Sky wowed audiences with their performances that evoked prog rock, free jazz, traditional Malay and Chinese music, and more. Again, the loose nature of the collective enabled them to create other projects such as Gulayu Arkestra, Five Leaves Left and Cactus - not to mention the solo efforts of members Jordan Johari Rais and Imran Abdul Rashid.

The independent record label Ujikaji has been credited for helping to promote experimental music. It has also promoted experimental music events at local venues, with some held in collaboration with The Observatory.

==Music venues==
The historic Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall was first constructed as a town hall in 1862. In 1905, the Victoria Memorial Hall was built as an expansion to the building; the two separate buildings would be linked by a clock tower, with the project formally completed in 1909. The venue would go on to host performing arts events such as music and theatre, as well as civic and political events. A multi-year refurbishment and reconstruction was completed in 2014.

Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay opened in 2002, succeeding the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall as the main performing arts centre of Singapore. The complex includes a 1,600-seat concert hall, which became the new home venue of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra in 2003.

The Singapore Conference Hall is used as a base for the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. There are also many clubs and music bars that offer live music in the city, particularly in the Clarke Quay area.

==Music education==
In Singapore, music as a subject in education was first introduced in 1935, and today General Music Programme is offered to all students in primary and secondary schools. The Enhanced Music Programme, started in 2011, is offered as an upper secondary programme in selected schools. Tertiary music education is also available in Singapore – the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, which received its first student intake in 2003, is the first to offer a four-year full-time Bachelor of Music degree programme. The conservatory is part of the National University of Singapore founded in partnership with the Peabody Conservatory, and it serves as a centre of training for young musicians in the Asia Pacific region with full scholarship provided.

Music education is also offered at other institutions such as Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, LASALLE College of the Arts, Raffles Music College and the School of the Arts.

==National Day songs==

Of particular note to the Singaporean music scene is what are often collectively known as &quot;National Day songs&quot;—a category of patriotic music written as signature for Singapore&#x27;s National Day parade. During the lead-up to National Day, the songs are taught at schools, and are played on state-owned radio and television to promote the parade. 

The tradition began in the 1980s, stemming from &quot;Operation Singalong&quot;—a project conducted by the National Folk Songs Committee to help bolster the solidarity of Singapore&#x27;s citizens by encouraging communal singing. The first examples of National Day songs were composed by Hugh Harrison, including &quot;Stand Up for Singapore&quot; (composed to mark the 25th anniversary of Singapore&#x27;s independence), &quot;Count On Me, Singapore&quot; (1986), and &quot;We Are Singapore&quot; (1987), which glorified the development of the country&#x27;s economy and national identity. Beginning in 1998, the songs began to have a more popular sound, being performed by local musicians. That year&#x27;s song, &quot;Home&quot; by Kit Chan, carried a theme of encouraging overseas Singaporeans to return to their homeland, and has been considered one of the most popular National Day songs. There has generally been a new song each year, with exceptions (such as 2014, when older songs were reprised amid the poor reception of other recent National Day songs). 

A survey conducted by the Lee Kuan Yew Centre For Innovative Cities in 2021 found that the most popular National Day songs usually had themes of nation-building, aspirations, and national identity.

An ad-hoc offshoot of these National Day songs are the songs specially composed for major events. A prominent example was the song &quot;Moments of Magic&quot;, written by Hype Records CEO Ken Lim specially for Singapore&#x27;s millennium celebrations towards the end of 1999. It was performed by three notable singers - Fann Wong, Tanya Chua and Elsa Lin. The music video was directed by Singapore filmmaker Eric Khoo.

<text>Jean-Claude Izzo (20 June 1945 – 26 January 2000) was a French poet, playwright, screenwriter, and novelist who achieved sudden fame in the mid-1990s with the publication of his three neo-noir crime novels &quot;Total Chaos&quot;, &quot;Chourmo&quot;, and &quot;Solea&quot; (widely known as the Marseilles Trilogy), featuring as protagonist ex-cop Fabio Montale, and set in the author&#x27;s native city of Marseille. All have been translated into English by Howard Curtis.

Jean-Claude Izzo was born on 20 June 1945 in Marseille, France. His father was an Italian immigrant from Castel San Giorgio (Province of Salerno) and his maternal grandfather was a Spanish immigrant. He excelled in school and spent much of his time at his desk writing stories and poems. But because of his &quot;immigrant&quot; status, he was forced into a technical school where he was taught how to operate a lathe.

In 1963, he began work in a bookstore. He also actively campaigned on behalf of Pax Christi, a Catholic peace movement. In 1964, he was called up for military duty in Toulon and Djibouti. He worked for the military newspaper as a photographer and journalist.

<text>Neurotechnology encompasses any method or electronic device which interfaces with the nervous system to monitor or modulate neural activity.

Common design goals for neurotechnologies include using neural activity readings to control external devices such as neuroprosthetics, altering neural activity via neuromodulation to repair or normalize function affected by neurological disorders, or augmenting cognitive abilities. In addition to their therapeutic or commercial uses, neurotechnologies also constitute powerful research tools to advance fundamental neuroscience knowledge.

Some examples of neurotechnologies include deep brain stimulation, photostimulation based on optogenetics and photopharmacology, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electric stimulation and brain–computer interfaces, such as cochlear implants and retinal implants.
The field of neurotechnology has been around for nearly half a century but has only reached maturity in the last twenty years. Decoding basic procedures and interactions within the brain&#x27;s neuronal activity is essential to integrate machines with the nervous system. This is one of the central steps of the technological revolution based on a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. Integrating an electronic device with the nervous system enables monitoring and modulating neural activity as well as managing implemented machines by mental activity. Further work in this direction would have profound implications for improving existing and developing new treatments for neurological disorders and advanced &quot;implantable neurotechnologies&quot; as integrated artificial implants for various pieces of the nervous system. Advances in these efforts are associated with developing models based on knowledge about natural processes in bio-systems that monitor and/or modulate neural activity. One promising direction evolves through studying the mother-fetus neurocognitive model. According to this model, the innate natural mechanism ensures the embryonic nervous system&#x27;s correct (balanced) development. Because the mother-fetus interaction enables the child&#x27;s nervous system to evolve with adequate biological sentience, similar environmental conditions can treat the injured nervous system. This means that the physiological processes of this natural neurostimulation during gestation underlie any noninvasive artificial neuromodulation technique. This knowledge paves the way for designing and precise tuning noninvasive brain stimulation devices in treating different nervous system diseases within the scope of modulating neural activity.

More specialized sectors of the neurotechnology development for monitoring and modulating neural activity are aimed at creating powerful concepts as &quot;neuron-like electrodes&quot;, &quot;hybrid biotic–abiotic electrodes&quot;, &quot;planar complementary metal-oxide semiconductor systems&quot;, &quot;injectable bioconjugate nanomaterials&quot;, &quot;implantable optoelectronic microchips&quot;.

The advent of brain imaging revolutionized the field, allowing researchers to directly monitor the brain&#x27;s activities during experiments. Practice in neurotechnology can be found in fields such as pharmaceutical practices, be it from drugs for depression, sleep, ADHD, or anti-neurotics to cancer scanning, stroke rehabilitation, etc.

Many in the field aim to control and harness more of what the brain does and how it influences lifestyles and personalities. Commonplace technologies already attempt to do this; games like BrainAge, and programs like Fast ForWord that aim to improve brain function, are neurotechnologies.

Currently, modern science can image nearly all aspects of the brain as well as control a degree of the function of the brain. It can help control depression, over-activation, sleep deprivation, and many other conditions. Therapeutically it can help improve stroke patients&#x27; motor coordination, improve brain function, reduce epileptic episodes (see epilepsy), improve patients with degenerative motor diseases (Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease, ALS), and can even help alleviate phantom pain perception. Advances in the field promise many new enhancements and rehabilitation methods for patients with neurological problems. The neurotechnology revolution has given rise to the Decade of the Mind initiative, which was started in 2007. It also offers the possibility of revealing the mechanisms by which mind and consciousness emerge from the brain.

==Types==

===Deep brain stimulation===

Deep brain stimulation is currently used in patients with movement disorders to improve the quality of life in patients.

===Transcranial ultrasound stimulation===
Transcrancial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a technique using ultrasound to modulate neural activity in the brain. It is an emerging technique that has shown therapeutic promise in a variety of neurological diseases. 

===Transcranial magnetic stimulation===
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique for applying magnetic fields to the brain to manipulate electrical activity at specific loci in the brain. This field of study is currently receiving a large amount of attention due to the potential benefits that could come out of better understanding this technology. Transcranial magnetic movement of particles in the brain shows promise for drug targeting and delivery as studies have demonstrated this to be noninvasive on brain physiology.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new method of studying how the brain functions and is used in many research labs focused on behavioral disorders, epilepsy, PTSD, migraine, hallucinations, and other disorders. Currently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is being researched to see if positive behavioral effects of TMS can be made more permanent. Some techniques combine TMS and another scanning method such as EEG to get additional information about brain activity such as cortical response.

===Transcranial direct current stimulation===
Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) is a form of neurostimulation which uses constant, low current delivered via electrodes placed on the scalp. The mechanisms underlying TDCS effects are still incompletely understood, but recent advances in neurotechnology allowing for &quot;in vivo&quot; assessment of brain electric activity during TDCS promise to advance understanding of these mechanisms. Research into using TDCS on healthy adults have demonstrated that TDCS can increase cognitive performance on a variety of tasks, depending on the area of the brain being stimulated. TDCS has been used to enhance language and mathematical ability (though one form of TDCS was also found to inhibit math learning), attention span, problem solving, memory, coordination and relieve depression and chronic fatigue.

===Electrophysiology===
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of measuring brainwave activity non-invasively. A number of electrodes are placed around the head and scalp and electrical signals are measured. Clinically, EEGs are used to study epilepsy as well as stroke and tumor presence in the brain. Electrocorticography (ECoG) relies on similar principles but requires invasive implantation of electrodes on the brain&#x27;s surface to measure local field potentials or action potentials more sensitively.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is another method of measuring activity in the brain by measuring the magnetic fields that arise from electrical currents in the brain. The benefit to using MEG instead of EEG is that these fields are highly localized and give rise to better understanding of how specific loci react to stimulation or if these regions over-activate (as in epileptic seizures).

There are potential uses for EEG and MEG such as charting rehabilitation and improvement after trauma as well as testing neural conductivity in specific regions of epileptics or patients with personality disorders. EEG has been fundamental in understanding the resting brain during sleep. Real-time EEG has been considered for use in lie detection.
Similarly, real-time fMRI is being researched as a method for pain therapy by altering how people perceive pain if they are made aware of how their brain is functioning while in pain. By providing direct and understandable feedback, researchers can help patients with chronic pain decrease their symptoms.

===Implants===

Neurotechnological implants can be used to record and utilize brain activity to control other devices which provide feedback to the user or replace missing biological functions. The most common neurodevices available for clinical use are deep brain stimulators implanted in the subthalamic nucleus for patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Pharmaceuticals===

Pharmaceuticals play a vital role in maintaining stable brain chemistry, and are the most commonly used neurotechnology by the general public and medicine. Drugs like sertraline, methylphenidate, and zolpidem act as chemical modulators in the brain, and they allow for normal activity in many people whose brains cannot act normally under physiological conditions. While pharmaceuticals are usually not mentioned and have their own field, the role of pharmaceuticals is perhaps the most far-reaching and commonplace in modern society. Movement of magnetic particles to targeted brain regions for drug delivery is an emerging field of study and causes no detectable circuit damage.

==Ethical considerations==

Like other disruptive innovations, neurotechnologies have the potential for profound social and legal repercussions, and as such their development and introduction to society raise a series of ethical questions.

Key concerns include the preservation of identity, agency, cognitive liberty and privacy as . While experts agree that these core features of the human experience stand to benefit from the ethical use of neurotechnology, they also make a point of emphasizing the importance of preventively establishing specific regulatory frameworks and other mechanisms that protect against inappropriate or unauthorized uses.

=== Identity ===
Identity in this context refers to personal continuity, described as bodily and mental integrity and their persistence over time. In other words, it is the individual&#x27;s self-narrative and concept of self.

While disruption of identity is not a common goal for neurotechnologies, some techniques can create unwanted shifts that range in severity. For instance, deep brain stimulation is commonly used as treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease but can have side effects that touch on the concept of identity, such as loss of voice modulation, increased impulsivity or feelings of self-estrangement. In the case of neural prostheses and brain-computer interfaces, the shift may take the form of an extension of one&#x27;s sense of self, potentially incorporating the device as an integral part of oneself or expanding the range of sensory and cognitive channels available to the user beyond the traditional senses.

Part of the difficulty in determining which changes constitute a threat to identity is rooted in its dynamic nature: since one&#x27;s personality and concept of self is expected to change with time as a result of emotional development and lived experience, it is not easy to identify clear criteria and draw a line between acceptable shifts and problematic changes. This becomes even harder when dealing with neurotechnologies aimed at influencing psychological processes—such as those designed to recude the symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by modulating emotional states or saliency of memories to ease a patient&#x27;s pain. Even helping a patient remember, which would seemingly help preserve identity, can be a delicate question: &quot;Forgetting is also important to how a person navigates the world, since it allows the opportunity for both losing track of embarrassing or difficult memories, and focusing on future-oriented activity. Efforts to enhance identity through memory preservation thus run the risk of inadvertently damaging a valuable, if less consciously-driven cognitive process.&quot;

=== Agency ===
Although the nuances of its definition are debated in philosophy and sociology, agency is commonly understood as the individual&#x27;s ability to consciously make and communicate a decision or choice. While identity and agency are distinct, an impairment in agency can in turn undermine personal identity: the subject may no longer be able to substantially modify their own self-narrative, and may therefore lose their ability to contribute to the dynamic process of identity formation.

The interplay between agency and neurotechnology can have implications for moral responsibility and legal liability. As with identity, devices aimed at treating some psychiatric conditions like depression or anorexia may work by modulating neural function linked with desire or motivation, potentially compromising the user&#x27;s agency. This can also be the case, paradoxically, for those neurotechnologies designed to restore agency to patients, such as neural prostheses and BCI-mediated assistive technology like wheelchairs or computer accessibility tools. Because these devices often operate by interpreting sensory inputs or the user&#x27;s neural data in order to estimate the individual&#x27;s intention and respond according to it, estimation margins can lead to inaccurate or undesired responses that may threaten agency: &quot;If the agent&#x27;s intent and the device&#x27;s output can come apart (think of how the auto-correct function in texting sometimes misinterprets the user&#x27;s intent and sends problematic text messages), the user&#x27;s sense of agency may be undermined.&quot;

===Privacy===
Finally, when these technologies are being developed society must understand that these neurotechnologies could reveal the one thing that people can always keep secret: what they are thinking. While there are large amounts of benefits associated with these technologies, it is necessary for scientists, citizens and policy makers alike to consider implications for privacy. This term is important in many ethical circles concerned with the state and goals of progress in the field of neurotechnology (see neuroethics). Current improvements such as &quot;brain fingerprinting&quot; or lie detection using EEG or fMRI could give rise to a set fixture of loci/emotional relationships in the brain, although these technologies are still years away from full application. It is important to consider how all these neurotechnologies might affect the future of society, and it is suggested that political, scientific, and civil debates are heard about the implementation of these newer technologies that potentially offer a new wealth of once-private information. Some ethicists are also concerned with the use of TMS and fear that the technique could be used to alter patients in ways that are undesired by the patient.

===Cognitive liberty===
Cognitive liberty refers to a suggested right to self-determination of individuals to control their own mental processes, cognition, and consciousness including by the use of various neurotechnologies and psychoactive substances. This perceived right is relevant for reformation and development of associated laws.

<text>Brunei is a southeast Asian country located on Borneo between the states of Sabah and Sarawak which are part of Malaysia. There is a wide array of native folk music, and dance. Brunei shares some Cultural perspectives and links with the countries of Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The strong Islamic influence means that dance performances and music are somewhat restricted.

==Folk music==
Adai-adai is a group work song sung by fisherpeople while they fished. Another folk dance is the Benari, or Joget Baju Putih, performed during numerous festivals. It is usually performed by three men and three women.
===Kedayan music===
Aduk-Aduk is a ceremonial dance performing by the Kedayan children before birthdays, especially at the end of the harvest season. Dancers wear traditional warrior&#x27;s attire, in tengkolok, red belt and black clothing, and dance to the beat of silat, a Malay martial art. This dance is accompanied by percussion instruments, including drums and coconut shells.

The Malay population are known for the Jipin or Zapin dance, performed by six men and women, accompanied by instruments that include the gambus dan biola, dombak and rebana. Gongs like the Kulintangan (a set of small gongs), duck gongs and other styles are played. Malay folk music is played by accomplished musicians at special feasts and celebrations. Responsive singing is sometimes performed at weddings, with the guests joining in. The song &quot;Alus Jua Dindang&quot; is also an important part of Bruneian wedding music; in it, the groom (who, in a traditional wedding does not know the bride beforehand), flatters and declares his devotion to his new wife.

==Music institutions==
The Brunei Music Society has been organising concerts of mainly Western classical music since its founding in 1972. These concerts are usually held at the Orchid Garden Hotel in BSB.

<text>Western Oregon University (WOU) is a public university in Monmouth, Oregon. It was originally established in 1856 by Disciples of Christ pioneers as Monmouth University. Subsequent names included Oregon State Normal School, Oregon College of Education, and Western Oregon State College. Western Oregon University incorporates both the College of Education and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Enrollment is approximately 3,750 students.

== History ==

===Establishment===

Western Oregon University was founded in 1856 as Monmouth University. In 1865, it merged with another private institution, Bethel College, in Bethel and became Christian College. In 1882, the Oregon State Legislature approved the college&#x27;s bid to become a state-supported teacher training (or &quot;normal&quot;) school, Oregon State Normal School.

In November 1910, an initiative petition (Measure 10) to establish a normal school at Monmouth, passed by 55.6%. The name was changed, for the fourth time, to Oregon Normal School. On the same ballot were two other measures to additionally establish normal schools in Ashland and Weston: both failed.

===Growth===

A period of growth was experienced in the 1920s during which the school&#x27;s enrollment more than tripled from 316 in 1920 to peak at the 990 mark in 1927. With the coming of the Great Depression attendance tailed off slightly, with an average attendance in 1930 of 705 students, hitting a nadir in the 1933–34 academic year. Attendance rebounded later in the decade, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time during the 1938–39 academic year, with a total enrollment including summer session of 1,017.

In 1939, the Oregon Legislature changed the name for the fifth time, to Oregon College of Education. The school entered an extended period of growth, except for a period during World War II when college enrollments dropped nationwide. New programs were added in the areas of liberal arts and sciences.

===Name changes===

In 1981, the institution was renamed Western Oregon State College to reflect the school&#x27;s growing academic programs in the liberal arts fields. In 1997 the name was updated to Western Oregon University, reflecting the university&#x27;s broader academic mission and profile.

== Academics ==
Western Oregon University offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees (BA, BS, BM, BFA), and AB through its two colleges: the College of Education and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Master&#x27;s degrees are available in Education (MAT and MSEd), Rehabilitation Counseling (MS), Criminal Justice (MA), Music (MM), and Management and Information Systems (MS). In 2015, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Western as the 77th best amongst the regional universities in the west.

In January 2024, the university announced it would eliminate its D- and F grades and instead replace these with a grade of &quot;no credit&quot;. This was done in attempt to improve retention and graduation rates and focus on student learning outcomes.

=== College of Education ===
WOU&#x27;s College of Education is divided into: Division of Education and Leadership, Division of Deaf Studies and Professional Studies, and Division of Health and Exercise Science.

===College of Liberal Arts and Sciences===
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences offers 30 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in seven academic divisions: Behavioral Science, Business and Economics, Computer Science, Creative Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Social Science.

==Athletics==
The Western Oregon athletic teams are called the Wolves. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) since the 2001–02 academic year. Western Oregon has competed in the Lone Star Conference (LSC) for football as an affiliate member since the 2022 season. The Wolves previously competed in the D-II Pacific West Conference (PacWest) from 1998–99 to 2000–01; and in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1993–94 to 1997–98 (although they remained in the CCC as an affiliate member for some sports from 1998–99 to 1999–2000).

Western Oregon competes in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball.

<text>New York Stories is a 1989 American anthology film consisting of three segments with the central theme being New York City.

The first is &quot;Life Lessons&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Richard Price and starring Nick Nolte. The second is &quot;Life Without Zoë&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and written by Coppola with his daughter, Sofia Coppola. The last is &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot;, directed, written by and starring Woody Allen. In foreign theatrical releases, the order of the three films was altered, Coppola&#x27;s being first, followed by Allen&#x27;s, and finishing with Scorsese&#x27;s. This movie also marks the film debuts of Adrien Brody and Kirsten Dunst.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
===&quot;Life Lessons&quot;===
Lionel Dobie is an acclaimed abstract artist who finds himself unable to paint during the days before a scheduled gallery exhibition of his new work. Paulette is Lionel&#x27;s assistant and former lover. Lionel is still infatuated with her, but Paulette wants only his tutelage, which makes things difficult since they live in the same studio-loft. Paulette dates other people, including a performance artist and a painter.

These deliberate provocations on Paulette&#x27;s part make Lionel insanely jealous—and fuel his creativity. Lionel and Paulette, it becomes clear, have been using each other: Lionel using her sexually, Paulette using him as a means of entry into the higher spheres of the New York social and art scene. Paulette wants to give up and go home to her parents but Lionel persuades her to stay because New York is where a painter needs to be.

Lionel pours his anxiety and repressed passion into his work. Paintings around the studio show visual metaphors from relations past: stormy skies, burning bridges, and tormented clowns. Lionel realizes that he needs the emotional turmoil of his destructive relationships in order to fuel his art. At the art exhibit, Lionel meets another attractive young woman, a struggling painter. He persuades her to become his assistant and potentially his lover, beginning the cycle anew.

===&quot;Life Without Zoë&quot;===
Zoë is a 12-year-old schoolgirl who lives in a luxury hotel. She helps return to an Arab princess a valuable piece of jewelry that the princess had given to Zoë&#x27;s father and had been subsequently stolen and recovered. Zoë tries to reconcile her divorced mother, a photographer, and father, a flautist.

===&quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot;===
New York lawyer Sheldon Mills has problems with his overly critical mother Sadie Millstein. Sheldon complains constantly to his therapist about her, wishing aloud that she would just disappear. Sheldon takes his &quot;shiksa&quot; fiancée, Lisa, to meet his mother, who immediately embarrasses him. The three, as well as Lisa&#x27;s children from a previous marriage, go to a magic show. His mother is invited on stage to be a part of the magician&#x27;s act. She is put inside a box that has swords stuck through it and she disappears, just as she is supposed to, but then she never reappears.

Although he is furious at first, this development turns out to be great for Sheldon because, with her out of his life, he can finally relax. But soon, to his horror, his mother reappears in the sky over New York City. She begins to annoy Sheldon and Lisa (with the whole city now watching) by constantly talking to strangers about his most embarrassing moments. This puts a strain on his relationship with Lisa, who leaves him. Sheldon is persuaded by his psychiatrist to see a psychic, Treva, to try to get his mother back to reality. Treva&#x27;s experiments fail, but Sheldon falls for her. When he introduces Treva to his mother, she approves and comes back to Earth.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;New York Stories&quot; opened on March 10, 1989, earning $432,337 in 12 theaters during its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $10,763,469 domestically playing in 514 theaters.

===Critical response===
&quot;New York Stories&quot; holds a 76% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 25 reviews.

Hal Hinson, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, felt that Coppola&#x27;s segment was &quot;by far the director&#x27;s worst work yet&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, &quot;&quot;New York Stories&quot; consists of three films, one good, one bad, one disappointing.&quot; He further explained, &quot;Of the three films, the only really successful one is &quot;Life Lessons&quot;, the Scorsese story of a middle-age painter and his young, discontented girlfriend. The Coppola, an updated version of the story of Eloise, the little girl who lived in the Plaza Hotel, is surprisingly thin and unfocused. And the Allen, about a 50-year-old man still dominated by his mother, starts well but then takes a wrong turn about halfway through.&quot; Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;The first segment is the best; then comes a sagging second part, during which hope is a thing with fluttering feathers; then hope is rewarded—the third part picks up smartly, if not to the level of the first.&quot;

<doc id="987389" wikidata="Q1132929" url="?curid=987389" title="Music of Botswana">
<text>Botswana is an African country made up of different ethnic groups, although Batswana are the majority of the population. Music is a large part of Botswana culture, and includes popular and folk forms. Botswana church choirs are common nationwide.

Beginning in the 19th century, Immigrants from the United Kingdom began arriving in large numbers and they called the colony Bechuanaland.

== History ==
The oldest known instrument from present-day Botswana is a &quot;seburuburu&quot; bullroarer crafted from a bone, dating to the Matlapaneng dig site and dating to approximately 1,000 years ago. A bone flute or whistle dating back approximately 900 years ago was discovered in the Bosutswe site, with one opening that is covered by the user to produce different notes. Bone instruments are the only ones of this age durable enough to survive to the present day.

Instruments were historically considered important items that owners preserved over the course of their life, and some were considered the heritage of the community and could not be sold without the chief&#x27;s permission. There was a religious significance to instruments, both in the materials used to make them and in blessings placed on them. They were then used in rituals to communicate with ancestors and request good fortune and health.

Of the charms carried by Tswana men in the 19th century to ward off evil, one was a whistle used as an alert to danger.

Traditional music of the Batswana and other peoples in the region was often performed daily prior to colonisation. This included both songs and religious chants. The norms introduced by the colonial government and the European missionaries largely ended such practices.

As Botswana&#x27;s education system grew in the 1950s, choir was widely taught. It grew to be a popular type of music as competitive choir singing became common. The Brown Kalanga Wizards were the first recording group in present-day Botswana, forming in the 1950s and producing two albums.

Traditional folk music saw a resurgence as part of Botswana&#x27;s independence movement and formation of a national identity. National radio broadcasts began in the 1960s, with choir and folk singing appearing as the most common genres. The folk singer and &quot;segaba&quot; player Ratsie Setlhako was one of the most popular post-independence musicians, performing at most national events from 1966 until his death in 1976.

Botswana was one of the first African countries to develop a hip hop following as the genre developed in the early 1980s. South African music grew and spread to Botswana following the end of Apartheid in 1994, including the &quot;kwaito&quot; and &quot;motswako&quot; genres.

The Botswana Telecommunications Authority started issuing radio broadcasting licenses in 1998. Yarona FM and Gabz FM began broadcasting in 1999. South African jazz, &quot;kwaito&quot;, and hip hop emerged as major genres at this time, and hip hop became the country&#x27;s most popular music genre by 2003.

== Traditional and folk music ==
Traditional folk songs are the most well known form of music to originate from Botswana, particularly those of the Tswana people. Songs are performed by several vocalists and instrumentalists, who may harmonise with one another or stagger their notes to create momentum with interlocking sounds. The reed dance is an example of harmonised choir that existed before the introduction of hymns in the colonial period.

Historically, music of the peoples in present-day Botswana was closely associated with religion and spiritual healing. Upon their arrival, European missionaries challenged the traditional African music as it was closely associated with native religion and spiritual beliefs. Christian denominations that developed natively, like the Zion Christian Church, incorporate native healing songs in its practices.

Traditional Tswana songs are pentatonic and have a short melody with a range of less than one octave. They use a call and response form in which the lead singer begins and is followed by the other singers. The response may be a repetition of the lead singer or a balancing melody, and the exchange is repeated numerous times, sometimes for several minutes. Diatonic folk songs became more common as Setswana music was influenced by foreign styles.

As Setswana and related languages are tone languages, these tonal changes can be used in musical performances, often alongside flutes.

Music may be used to imitate animal sounds, such as bird calls. The San people use bowstrings to imitate the sound of hoofbeats.

Dance is closely integrated with traditional music and an essential element of its performance. Many of the instruments used in traditional songs require deliberate, complex movement of the body, particularly through the use of rattles.

Play songs feature staccato sounds, made by clapping or by wearing rattles.

Rite of passage songs carry messages for adolescents about innocence and chastity. Such songs for girls often use a &quot;moropa&quot; drum.

War songs often incorporate a &quot;motlhatswa&quot; whistle or a &quot;lepatata&quot; horn.

== Traditional instruments ==

Vocalisation and string instruments make up the largest portion of Setswana folk music. Musical bows are common string instruments, including &quot;lengope&quot;, the &quot;nkokwane&quot;, the &quot;segwane&quot;, and the &quot;mafata-iswaneng&quot;, which are resonated through the mouth, through a gourd, through a tin can, and through the ground, respectively. The &quot;katara&quot; is a two-string or three-string guitar. The &quot;segankuru&quot; is held on the shoulder using a wire and played with a bow in a circular motion. This is the most common instrument in modern Setswana folk music. The San people traditionally play the &quot;quashi&quot;, a type of bow-like lute.

The &quot;sekinkane&quot; is a thumb piano sometimes used in Setswana folk music.

Some Batswana women are able to ululate, a trilling sound used as a form of cheering.

=== Percussion ===
&quot;Matlhowa&quot; are rattles that are worn on the leg or the ankle. They are traditionally made of cocoons filled with pebbles or seeds. Each rattle is crafted from over one hundred cocoons, which are soaked, filled, dried, and then tied by each end to a string. Other rattles were created using the ears of springboks.

Clapping is common in traditional songs of the Tswana and San peoples, among other groups in the region. Wooden clappers may be used for this purpose, or &quot;marapo&quot; hand clappers crafted from bone. Among the Tswana people, clapping is often done at a beat of 4/4 or 2/4. It is historically the role of women to clap during songs.

Drums are less common in Setswana folk music relative to that of other African peoples, both in how often they are used overall and how prominently they appear in songs where they are present. This comes from the difficulty of finding trees of sufficient size to make drums in the Kalahari Desert. The only type of drum found in traditional Setswana music is the &quot;moropa&quot;, which can be formed from several materials, such as a tree trunk, a milk jug, or a can. Modern drums in Botswana are often two-sided, made of a short metal cylinder wrapped in cowhide.

The Kalanga people use drums more frequently than other peoples of Botswana. The Mbukushu people use friction drums, which is played by rubbing a reed tied to the drumhead. The Herero people use a two-sided &quot;ongoma&quot;, which is beat with sticks. The Kgatla people began using drums for women&#x27;s &quot;bojale&quot; initiation ceremonies in 1871. The peoples of northern and northeastern Botswana fashioned tree trunk drums using animal hides as a cover, applying them fresh so they would shrink around the shape of the drum while drying. These drums were held between the legs at an angle while played.

=== Wind ===
Traditional wind instruments are often made of bone, reed, or animal horn. The &quot;lengwane&quot; and the &quot;motlhatswa&quot;, made of goat bone and a hollowed tree branch, respectively, are played by blowing across its top. The &quot;lenaka la phala&quot;, the &quot;lepatata&quot;, and the &quot;lenaka la tholo&quot; are made of an impala horn, a sable antelope horn, and a kudu horn, respectively. They are played by blowing into the instrument&#x27;s narrow end. Wind instruments traditionally had practical uses, such as communication between herders, calling to cattle, and summoning spirits. Medics wore plugged whistles around their necks, which they used to carry medicine.

Flutes and whistles feature prominently in traditional music of the Batswana and the San. Reed flutes were made by driving a stick through the reed to hollow it. This produced either the short, high-pitched &quot;mpenyane&quot; flute or the low-pitched &quot;meporo&quot; created by joining reeds together. &quot;Meporo&quot; flutes could be nearly six feet long, and the plug at the end was manipulated with a stick to change its tune. These reed flutes were replaced by metal flutes in the 20th century.

== Hip hop ==

Hip hop spread to Botswana from the United States. Because of this, English-language rapping in Botswana typically uses American English. The earliest hip hop of Botswana in the 1980s incorporated sampling, drum machines, beatboxing, turntablism, and instrumentation. Hip hop music videoes are associated with detailed storytelling.

The Wizards were formed as an early hip hop group in Botswana, also incorporating reggae and rhythm and blues. Jeff Matheatau is a prominent Motswana rapper. The record label Phat Boy signs with Batswana hip hop artists.

The radio and television show &quot;Strictly Hip-Hop&quot;, hosted by Dave Balsher (Draztik) and Salim Mosidinyane (Slim), helped popularise hip hop in Botswana. Both had brought American hip hop with them after moving to Botswana from the United States, and both were members of the hip hop groups Cashless Society and Organik Interfaze. Other radio hosts, such as Ndala Baitsile (DJ Sid) and David Molosiwa (D-Ski) also contributed to its spread.

&quot;Motswako&quot; is a subgenre of hip hop. It was popularised in Botswana by the Francistown-born South African artist Tebogo Mapine (Nomadic). He was a member of the Gaborone hip hop group P-Side Crew, one of the earliest hip hop groups in Botswana, from 1994. &quot;Motswako&quot; is usually rapped in Setswana, though it sometimes includes American English terms. Thato Matlhabaphiri (Scar) and Game Bantsi (Zeus) are &quot;motswako&quot; artists who rose to prominence in the 2010s.

==Popular music==
Botswana&#x27;s popular music is broadly referred to as &quot;jazz&quot;, which is common among African countries, though it is distinct from the jazz that originated in the Western world. Botswana has relatively few native popular music artists, and most of the country&#x27;s popular music is imported from Europe, South Africa, and the United States. American rock and gospel have a presence in Botswana.

&quot;Kwaito&quot; music is commonly performed in South African languages like Afrikaans and Zulu, as well as American English. The &quot;kwaito&quot; singer Frank Lesokwane was one of the most successful artists in the early 21st century. Thabo Mapetla Ntirelang is another prominent &quot;kwaito&quot; artist. &quot;Kwaito&quot; culture has similarities to hip hop culture. The &quot;kwasa-kwasa&quot; genre developed in Botswana, based on Congolese &quot;kwassa kwassa&quot; music. &quot;Kwaito kwasa&quot; is a fusion genre of &quot;kwasa-kwasa&quot; and &quot;kwaito&quot;. Vee Mampeezy is a prominent &quot;kwaito kwasa&quot; artist.

The development of rock music&#x27;s popularity in Botswana has been gradual. The music has begun to gain momentum, partly due to mainstream media such as MTV, Channel O and the internet. The native Batswana have demonstrated an appreciation for this genre, and since 2000 many new bands have been formed; most play locally, but a few have toured southern Africa. Rock culture has been recognized with bands uniting in a &quot;Rock Against AIDS&quot; tour. Crackdust was famous Metal band in Botswana. The National Music Eisteddfod is held annually in Selebi-Phikwe.

== Industry and economics ==
Radio stations in Botswana often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. Many radio stations in Botswana are locally owned media.

An independent music industry (&quot;indie music&quot;) does exist and artists remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen.

Vendors often sell CDs made specifically to be played at weddings, featuring both wedding music and pop music.

== Education ==
Music is taught in primary education and offered as an elective in secondary and tertiary education. Dance is generally included within music education.

High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band.

== Holidays and festivals ==
Public events and gatherings in Botswana are frequently accompanied by music, including holiday gatherings, fairs, dedications, and other celebrations. Each type of event or subject has its own associated songs.

It is common for individuals and groups to sing in public, sometimes spontaneously.

Music is an important part of several Botswana holidays, playing a major part in the celebration of Christmas.

Botswana is home to numerous music festivals, which showcase styles ranging from house to jazz to hip hop. Some music festivals are opened in local areas.

<text>Aerosmith is the debut studio album by the American rock band Aerosmith, released on January 5, 1973, by Columbia Records. &quot;Dream On&quot;, originally released as a single in 1973, became an American top ten hit when re-released on December 27, 1975. The album peaked at number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in 1976.

== Background ==
After entering a partnership with Frank Connelly, David Krebs and Steve Leber invited members of two record labelsAtlantic Records and Columbia Recordsto view an Aerosmith concert at Max&#x27;s Kansas City. Clive Davis, the president of Columbia, was impressed with the band and Aerosmith signed with Columbia in the summer of 1972.

Although lead singer Steven Tyler had been in several previous groups, most of the band members had never been in a studio before. The band was heavily influenced by many of the British blues/rock bands of the 1960s, including the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Yardbirds, and Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac.

== Composition ==
The album&#x27;s songs were largely written by Tyler, in contrast to later albums where other band members also contributed songs. The album&#x27;s songs represent an early success in songwriting, a skill he had recently developed. He explains in a 1998 interview: 

&quot;Make It&quot; leads off the album and also served as the band&#x27;s opening song during their first tours. Tyler wrote the song on the back of a Kleenex box in the back seat of the car as the group drove down from New Hampshire to Boston to move in together to start the band. Tyler was inspired both by the sudden view of the city through the windshield and the possibilities that starting the new band presented. He explains to biographer Stephen Davis, &quot;I wrote &#x27;Make It&#x27; in a car driving from New Hampshire to Boston. There&#x27;s that hill you come to and see the skyline of Boston, and I was sitting in the backseat thinking, What would be the greatest thing to sing for an audience if we were opening up for the... Stones? What would the lyrics say?&quot; Drummer Kramer elaborates on the song&#x27;s sentiment in a 1998 interview: &quot;You could search the ends of the earth, and I don&#x27;t think you could find five more different guys. The one thing that we all had in common was that we all wanted to make it. And making it back then had nothing to do with being rich and famous. It had to do with being recognized, by your peers and people, for being a great band and being able to play concerts where a lot of people would come.&quot;

&quot;Somebody&quot; dates from Tyler&#x27;s previous band, Chain Reaction. Tyler explains, &quot;&#x27;Somebody&#x27; grew out of a lick that our roadie Steve Emsback used to play on his guitar during the days of William Proud. I grabbed it and wrote the lyrics.&quot; The music was also influenced by the Rolling Stones&#x27; version of &quot;Route 66&quot;, which the band would use to rehearse to tighten up their playing. Tyler explains, &quot;Back when we were a nothing band, we&#x27;d get into rehearsals at Boston University in the basement, and we would do things like play &#x27;Route 66&#x27; and keep rehearsing it. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s grab that one piece in there&#x27; [hums the bridge]. We did and came up with &#x27;Somebody&#x27;.&quot; Tyler continues in his memoir: &quot;&#x27;Route 66&#x27; was our Stones mantra, a way of finding our groove. It was the riff I asked the band to play again and again in the basement of BU to show them what tight playing meant. We played it so many times it eventually morphed into the melody for &#x27;Somebody&#x27; on our first album.&quot;

Tyler wrote &quot;Dream On&quot; in stages over several years, finalizing the lyrics during the album&#x27;s sessions. He explains, &quot;The music for &#x27;Dream On&#x27; was originally written on a Steinway upright piano in the living room of Trow-Rico Lodge in Sunapee, maybe four years before Aerosmith even started. I was seventeen or eighteen... It was just this little thing I was playing, and I never dreamed it would end up as a real song or anything... It&#x27;s about dreaming until your dreams come true.&quot; The song is famous for its building climax to showcase Tyler&#x27;s trademark screams. It was written on piano but the recording contains a two-guitar arrangement, with guitarist Brad Whitford explaining to &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s Alan Di Perna in 1997, &quot;The idea was just to transcribe what Steven was doing with his left and right hands on the piano.&quot; Explains Tyler, &quot;Never in a million years did I think I&#x27;d take it to guitar. When I transposed it to guitar Joe played the right fingers and Brad played the left hand on guitar. Sitting there working it out on guitar and piano I got a little melodramatic. The song was so good it brought a tear to my eye.&quot; The song is composed in the key of F minor.

&quot;One Way Street&quot; was inspired by one of Tyler&#x27;s relationships at the time. He explains, &quot;&#x27;One Way Street&#x27; was written on piano at 1325 [the street number of the house where the band lived], with rhythm and the harp coming from &#x27;Midnight Rambler.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Mama Kin&quot; was written on the same guitar found in the trash that Tyler later used to write &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot;. He explains, &quot;One day I grabbed this old guitar Joey Kramer found in the garbage on Beacon Street, an acoustic with no strings. It had snow on it and was so warped you could shoot arrows with it. I wedged it between the door and let it dry for a week. I looked at it for about two days, put four strings on it, which was all it would take because it was so warped... I stole the opening lick from an old Blodwyn Pig song,&quot; &quot;See My Way.&quot; In a 2001 interview, Tyler explains the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;People always ask, &#x27;What&#x27;s &quot;mama kin&quot;?&#x27; It&#x27;s the mother of everything. It&#x27;s the desire to write music, the desire to get laid, to go through the relationship with a girl, or whatever it is. Keeping in touch with mama kin means keeping in touch with the old spirits that got you there to begin with.&quot;

Tyler explains that &quot;&#x27;Write Me&#x27; was originally &#x27;Bite Me,&#x27; something we&#x27;d been working on for five or six months starting in the Bruins&#x27; dressing room at the Boston Garden, but it just didn&#x27;t make it. Then one day I said, &#x27;Fuck this,&#x27; said something to Joey, who started playing like a can-can rhythm thing, and suddenly there it was.&quot; The intro was inspired by &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; by the Beatles.

Tyler considers &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; to be the &quot;first song of Aerosmith.&quot; He explains, &quot;&#x27;Movin&#x27; Out&#x27; was the first song I wrote with Joe, the first experience of coming up with something and saying, &#x27;See? I &quot;can&quot; do it.&#x27;&quot; In his memoir, Tyler remembers writing the song with Perry sitting on a waterbed at their apartment: &quot;One day at the very beginning of 1971 I wrote the basic track and lyrics for &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; on a water bed with Joe Perry in our living room at 1325 Com. Ave. Joe&#x27;s sitting on the water bed and I hear him strumming this thing and I go, &#x27;Hold on...whoa, what&#x27;s that?&#x27; and a minute later, Joe&#x27;s riffing and I&#x27;m scribbling. I leaped up and shouted, &#x27;Guys! Do you realize what we just did?&#x27; Their enthusiasm was curbed. &#x27;Yeah, what is it, man?&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s our firstborn!&#x27; I proclaimed. &#x27;The first Aerosmithed song! How great is that?&#x27;&quot;

The album concludes with a cover of Rufus Thomas&#x27; &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Dog&quot;, a concert staple of the band which they learned from the Rolling Stones cover. It was used in place of an original psychedelic pop song, &quot;Major Barbara&quot;.

== Recording ==
The group recorded their debut album at Intermedia Studios in 331 Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts with record producer Adrian Barber. For the most part, the production is sparse and dry: two guitars, bass, drums, a singer, and occasionally piano. The most unusual feature of the album is how different Tyler sounds compared to the albums that followed. In his autobiography Tyler recalls, &quot;The band was very uptight. We were so nervous that when the red recording light came on we froze. We were scared shitless. I changed my voice into the Muppet, Kermit the Frog, to sound more like a blues singer.&quot; He continues in a 1998 interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the way I sang. I was very critical about sounding like a white boy in the choir.&quot; In 1997 the singer told Stephen Davis, &quot;I changed my voice when we did the final vocals. I didn&#x27;t like my voice, the way it sounded. I was insecure, but nobody told me not to.&quot; 

The band recalls the production of the album and their working relationship with producer Adrian Barber with mixed sentiment. Tyler suggests that producer Barber was &quot;good for his time&quot; but it was like &quot;being with a retarded child in there, and I&#x27;m not sure if it was because he was so high, or because we all were.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Rocks&quot;, Joe Perry is more critical of Barber: 

Bassist Tom Hamilton later confessed, &quot;The album was done so fast I barely remember anything but overdubbing some tracks and running to the bathroom for a hit of blow&quot;. Perry reflected, &quot;We were uptight, afraid to make mistakes... We were total novices with no idea what to go for.&quot; 

== Album cover ==
On the original cover, the song &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Dog&quot; was misprinted as &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Dig&quot;. When a second pressing of the album was released, this error was corrected. Sometime after June 1973, but before January 1975, a third cover was printed. This has a modified version of the original, made up entirely of the photo of the band members, adding the &#x27;Featuring &quot;Dream On&quot;&#x27; text and removing the biography information on the back. This third pressing is the more commonly available version of the LP. &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine lists an &quot;Aerosmith II&quot; (Columbia KC 32045) release in the February 1, 1975 issue. As this catalog number is consistent with a June 1973 date, it is possible Columbia used this number to identify the &#x27;Featuring &quot;Dream On&quot;&#x27; cover, but stayed with the original KC 32005 catalog number on the actual release. In January 1975 &quot;Aerosmith&quot; was re-issued with the &quot;PC&quot; prefix, so there may have been some confusion as to the correct number. When reissued on CD in 1993 as a remastered version, the original artwork was used.

Recalling the album art, Perry commented in 2014, &quot;Unfortunately the packaging was lame. We didn&#x27;t even see the cover until the first printing. It was something that Columbia just threw together... The whole thing was sloppy. It marked the start of our education in dealing with labels.&quot;

==Promotion==
&quot;Dream On&quot; was released as a single and became Aerosmith&#x27;s first major hit and a classic rock radio staple. The single peaked at number 59 nationally but hit big in the band&#x27;s native Boston, where it was the number 1 single of the year on the less commercial top 40 station, WVBZ-FM, number 5 for the year on highly rated Top 40 WRKO-AM, and number 16 on heritage Top 40 WMEX-AM. 

The album version of &quot;Dream On&quot; (4:28, as opposed to the 3:25 1973 45rpm edit) was re-issued late in 1975, debuting at number 81 on January 10, 1976, breaking into the Top 40 on February 14 and peaking at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 national chart on April 10. Columbia chose to service Top 40 radio stations with a re-issue of the 3:25 edited version, thus, many 1976 Pop Radio listeners were exposed to the group&#x27;s first Top 10 effort through the 45 edit.

In 1973, Aerosmith toured extensively behind the album, playing clubs in New England as well as larger venues throughout the eastern United States, opening for other groups including Mott the Hoople, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and The Kinks. The jazz fusion, almost classical style of Mahavishnu Orchestra proved to be an idiosyncratic fit. Joe Perry explains, &quot;After us, John McLaughlin would ask for a moment of silence. I guess he figured they needed it.&quot; The band&#x27;s managers would book the band to open for groups that were waning in popularity, so that Aerosmith would have a chance to steal their audience. Manager David Krebs explains, &quot;We learned to play our market so that Aerosmith opened for acts that were slightly on the downslide – bands whose audience we could cop. Even if we didn&#x27;t blow them off the stage every time, we could at least count on some to buy an Aerosmith album.&quot; Tom Hamilton explains, &quot;I think what we wanted to do, without ever really saying it, was to be the American equivalent of all the great British bands like Cream, the Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. They were all so classy and powerful sounding. We couldn&#x27;t think of an American band like that. We wanted to be the first one.&quot; Steven Tyler continues, &quot;We were the guys you could actually see. It wasn&#x27;t like Zeppelin was out there on the road in America all the time, the Stones weren&#x27;t always coming to your town. We were America&#x27;s band — the garage band that made it real big, the ultimate party band.&quot;

During the year, the group played sets featuring the new album for two different radio broadcasts and made their first television appearance. Both radio performances were professionally recorded. In March, WBCN Boston DJ Maxanne Sartori, who would promote the group through frequent playing of &quot;Dream On&quot;, invited the group to broadcast their set from Paul&#x27;s Mall in Boston. Two tracks from the performance would later be released on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot;. In September, the group would perform a set at Counterpart Studios in the Cheviot neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio for WKRQ. Two tracks from this performance would see release in 1991 on &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;. In December, the group appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to perform &quot;Dream On&quot;.

== Reception ==

The album was not a success when it was released on January 5, 1973. To the band&#x27;s disappointment, it was not reviewed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Moreover, Columbia released &quot;Aerosmith&quot; at the same time as Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;, for which they made a greater promotional effort. Critics compared the band unfavorably to the Rolling Stones and the New York Dolls. In a 1998 interview, Bassist Tom Hamilton recalls a lukewarm reception from radio stations at first: 

In a modern review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Aerosmith as &quot;truly an American band, sounding as though they were the best bar band in your local town, cranking out nasty hard-edged rock&quot;; he considered &quot;Dream On&quot; &quot;the blueprint for all power ballads&quot; and the album a worthy debut where the band&#x27;s &quot;sleazoid blues-rock&quot; sound is fully present but not yet perfected as in the next album. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described the album as &quot;raw, dirty and steeped with squalid integrity&quot;, but observed that &quot;every successive release sounds light years ahead in terms of production, songcraft, maturity, everything&quot;.

In an interview to &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin recalled: &quot;Growing up in Indiana, I &quot;loved&quot; fucking Aerosmith, man... Smoke a joint, listen to the first record.&quot; Aerosmith was considered a big influence on Guns N&#x27; Roses and helped shape their sound.

<doc id="987406" wikidata="Q6941999" url="?curid=987406" title="Music of Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>The music of Antigua and Barbuda is largely African in character, and has only felt a limited influence from European styles due to the population of Antigua and Barbuda descending mostly from West Africans who were made slaves by Europeans.

Antigua and Barbuda is a Caribbean nation in the Lesser Antilles island chain. The country is a second home for many of the pan-Caribbean genres of popular music, and has produced stars in calypso, soca, steeldrum, zouk and reggae. Of these, steeldrum and calypso are the most integral parts of modern Antiguan popular music; both styles are imported from the music of Trinidad and Tobago.

Little to no musical research has been undertaken on Antigua and Barbuda other than this. As a result, much knowledge on the topic derives from novels, essays and other secondary sources.

== History ==
Documented music in Antigua and Barbuda began only with the discovery of Antigua, then populated by Arawak and Caribs, by Christopher Columbus in 1493. The islands&#x27; early music, however, remains little studied. In the 1780s, documentation exists for African workers participating in outdoor dances accompanied by the &quot;banjar&quot; (later &quot;&quot;, perhaps related to the banjo) and &quot;toombah&quot; (later &quot;tum tum&quot;), a drum decorated with shell and tin jingles. By the 1840s, sophisticated subscription balls were common, held biweekly with European-derived quadrilles accompanied by fiddle, tambourine and triangle.

Colonial era churches and missionary activity displaced and otherwise influenced the music of the African slaves, who adopted elements of European-derived religious music. The brass bands of the Salvation Army are an important example. In the mid- to late 19th century, a number of Portuguese indentured workers came to Antigua, bringing with them their styles of music. When most of the Portuguese left in the 1880s, Lebanese music was brought to the island by immigrants from that country.

== Folk music ==

During the period of British and French colonial rule, African slaves were prohibited from celebrating in Carnival; they continued to do so, secretly, at home. There, an Afro-Caribbean style of percussion, dance and song called benna developed. Later, Antiguan and Barbudan folk music became more dominated by Trinidadian calypso and steelpan.

Most forms of modern Antiguan and Barbudan music are not indigenous to the islands, and were imported from France, the United Kingdom, United States, Jamaica and Trinidad. Colonial dance styles like the highland fling and the quadrille remain popular in Africanized form. The loss of Antiguan traditions can be ascribed to the lack of a French colonial past (French islands of the Lesser Antilles retain much African-derived music and dance), the influence of the powerful Codrington family, a relatively unified African ethnic identity, the lack of African immigration after the peak of slavery importation, the British military presence at Shirley Heights and a modern history of unstable economy and government.

=== Old Time Christmas Festival ===

The Old Time Christmas Festival was a culturally significant celebration, replaced in 1957 by a Trinidadian-inspired Carnival. The Antiguan Christmas Festival included several elements that have been adopted into the modern Carnival.

Christmas Festival traditions include both music and dance, especially related to masquerades and iron bands. The highland fling is a common Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of cowhide. Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns took part in the John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in lanterns, called &quot;carol trees&quot;, singing with accompaniment by the concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the &quot;Moko jumbie&quot;, &quot;Jumpa-Ben&quot; or &quot;Long Ghosts&quot;, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (&quot;cling-a-ching&quot;) and the boompipe, made from a plumbing joint one meter long.

=== Benna ===

Benna (or &quot;bennah&quot;) is an uptempo Antiguan folk song that was introduced following the prohibition of slavery. Songs usually focused on scandalous and bawdy rumors and gossip, and were in a call-and-response form with a leader and an audience. Benna&#x27;s popularity and similarity to calypso helped make the island receptive to that genre&#x27;s introduction. The modern performer King Short Shirt has attempted to revive the benna in modern years, with his 1977 album &quot;Harambee&quot; an influential work that began updating benna with social and political awareness.

By the beginning of the 20th century, it had become a method of folk communication, disseminating news and reports from across the island. In the 1940s and 50s, an improvisational benna singer named John &quot;Quarkoo&quot; Thomas sang up-to-date stories on legal scandals, and the sexual affairs of the upper-class. He was eventually imprisoned because of the lyrics to &quot;Cocoatea&quot;, which was about the daughter of a respected citizen, and her secret pregnancy while in a convent.

=== Popular music ===

In other popular genres of music Antigua is best known for oldest and most successful soca band the Burning Flames, who have claimed the road march title for many years, most recently 2005. Another well-known Antiguan musician was Patrick &quot;Johnny&quot; Gomes, who worked for, among many others, the calypso giant Mighty Swallow. The most famous indigenous musician in Antigua and Barbuda may be Oscar Mason, whose son O&#x27;Neill is also a noted trombonist. The Antigua Community Players have been active for more than 52 years, performing a variety of musical productions in many styles, including the Antiguan folk song, &quot;benna&quot;. 

Jazz guitarist Roland Prince was from Antigua.

Basil Hill, owner of King Midas Records in New York, built a large international nightclub called the Atmosphere in 1978, creating a direct outlet for Antigua and Barbudan singers and bands.

Elements of non-Antiguan and Barbudan music have continued to be imported to the islands in the latter 20th century, including the electronic gospel music of the American Baptist church, and the Afro-Jamaican drumming of Rastafarian music.

Platinum-selling Antiguan-German singer-songwriter Au/Ra was also raised in Antigua, who has excelled in dance and pop music.

=== Carnival ===
&quot;See full article: Antigua Carnival&quot;

The Antiguan Carnival is a celebration of music and dance held annually from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the &quot;j&#x27;ouvert&quot; (or &quot;juvé&quot;), in which brass and steel bands perform for much of the island&#x27;s population. Barbuda&#x27;s Carnival in June, and is known as Caribana. The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism in Antigua and Barbuda. Some elements of the Christmas Festival remain in the modern Carnival celebrations, which are otherwise largely based on the Trinidadian Carnival. The author Frank Manning has argued that this change, from indigenous traditions to tourist-oriented elements, has reduced Antiguans to &quot;positions as service personnel and &#x27;mimic men&#x27;, robbing the culture of its natural integrity and cultural history&quot;.

=== Music festival ===

The Antigua and Barbuda international music festival, Romantic Rhythms, is a new addition to the summer line-up that peaks in August at the notorious Carnival celebrations. Geared to becoming a competing counterpart to the Carnival, the festival could eventually become the leading musical event in the entire Caribbean region. In its first year of establishment, the music festival already had some of the world&#x27;s top artists perform.

=== Steelpan ===

The steelpan comes in many different forms, and put together is called a &quot;steel orchestra&quot;. Steel bands traditionally are made up of old pieces of metal such as old irons, tire rims, or steel pipes. Antigua&#x27;s steel orchestras and iron bands can be found in churches and in many villages, and have been popular since their introduction. Every Carnival there is a competition to dub the best band of the island. Antigua&#x27;s largest and oldest steel orchestra that still competes is Hell&#x27;s Gate. It is said that the Brute Force Steel Band was the first steelpan band to record an album.

Steel orchestras have evolved to using highly technical instruments costing up to US$1500 for one instrument. These pans are meticulously honed out of the steel drum, sunken and burned over a hot fire, chromed and tuned. This process was perfected in Trinidad and Tobago and exported to Antigua and Barbuda through various collaborations between several of the bands in both island-nations.

=== Calypso ===
Calypso was sung throughout the English-speaking Caribbean, and was used by the poor as a platform for social and political commentary, using complex metaphors and folkloric references to obscure their meaning to outsiders. Later, beginning in the 1960s, a popularized kind of calypso was developed for use in tourist hotels. The first hotel calypsonians were Black Shirt, Skeetch and Dadian, who were accompanied by a string ensemble of two guitars and a bass guitar (created out of an oil drum). The Antigua Carnival, and the Antiguan Calypso King competition, began in 1957; the King that year was Styler. This era also saw a growth in patriotic calypsos, focused on an emerging sense of victorious nationalism in the wake of growing autonomy. By the middle of the 1960s, two rival calypsonians dominated the Antiguan scene, Zemaki and Lord Canary. Their conflict was perpetuated as the King Short Shirt and Swallow rivalry during the 1970s and 1980s. In the middle of the 1980s, the Burning Flames emerged, winning the road march with &quot;Styley Tight&quot; in 1985. They achieved pan-Caribbean acclaim.

It is clear that the genre of music now called calypso had strong roots in Trinidad and Tobago, but it would be inaccurate to suggest that this music started in any one island. Every island in the Caribbean has a form of music that resembles &quot;kaiso&quot;, more commonly referred to as calypso. It is inaccurate to attribute the origin of calypso to any island. In Belize, they call their variation &quot;punta&quot;. In Antigua they call theirs &quot;benna&quot;.

Particularly in the English-speaking islands and Belize, African cultural roots have greatly influenced the beats and form of the music. All these musical forms borrow beats from West African highlife music and have fused North American pop and R&amp;B with the Latin beats of central and South America and Cuba to form distinct musical genres which have significant variations in islands that were influenced by the French. Zouk and cadence are other popular variations.

==Soca==
The defining staccato bass was the creation of the late Lord Shorty from Barrackpore, Trinidad and Tobago, and rose to fame as Lord Shorty with his 1963 hit &quot;Clock and Dagger&quot;. He started out writing songs and performing in the calypso genre. In the 1970s, he began experimenting with calypso by blending it with the local chutney — the music of Trinidad&#x27;s East Indian population — using instruments such as the sitar and tabla. The style was dubbed &quot;soca&quot;.

<text>Montenegro is a municipality of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. As of 2020, it has 65,721 inhabitants.

The town was established in 1847 to be settled primarily by German immigrants from the Hunsrück region of southwest Germany. The local language was Riograndenser Hunsrückisch for most of its history, and it is still spoken there after 150 years of the initial settlement. Today, however, Portuguese prevails, mostly as a result of the campaign of the &quot;Nacionalização&quot; (&quot;Nationalization&quot;) forcefully imposed on all German and Italian settled areas of southern Brazil by president and dictator Getúlio Vargas in the 1940s.

==Railway connection==

In 1909 a new railway line connected Montenegro to São Leopoldo, which led to a quickening of economic development both in Montenegro itself and in other regional municipalities such as Maratá, Salvador do Sul and Barão. The railway was extended in 1932 and again in 1950, but at the end of the 1960s it was closed. It was subsequently decided to convert the former railway station into a &quot;Cultural Center&quot;.

==Distinguished sons and daughters==
Cardinal Cláudio Hummes, one of the candidates to the Catholic Church papacy in April 2005, was born in the area. On July 2, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI erected the new Roman Catholic Diocese of Montenegro, making it a Suffragan See in the province of the metropolitan archdiocese of Porto Alegre, from whose territory it was taken.

<text>Get Your Wings is the second studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on March 15, 1974. The album was their first to be produced by Jack Douglas, who also was responsible for the band&#x27;s next three albums. Three singles were released from the album, but none reached the singles charts.
The album has been released in stereo and quadraphonic, and certified triple platinum by the RIAA.

==Background==
In January 1973, Aerosmith released its debut album to little fanfare. As guitarist Joe Perry recalled in the 1997 band memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;There was no nothing at all: no press, no radio, no airplay, no reviews, no interviews, no party. Instead the album got ignored and there was a lot of anger and flipping out.&quot; In response to the album&#x27;s lack of success, the group toured extensively and built their fanbase, taking a break in December 1973 to record their follow up album. The group recorded the album at New York&#x27;s Record Plant, with Jack Douglas serving as the producer. Douglas would go on to record several albums with the group.

==Writing==
Like their first album, the group began the sessions with several of the songs already written. Their cover of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&quot; had long been part of their concert repertoire, and the group had been playing new songs &quot;S.O.S. (Too Bad)&quot; and &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; in concert since September 1973. &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; and &quot;Woman of the World&quot; also predated the sessions, while &quot;Spaced&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; were written during the sessions. In 1997, Perry explained to Aerosmith biographer Stephen Davis:

&quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; was the last song written for &quot;Get Your Wings.&quot; The band needed one additional song for the album, so they locked themselves in Studio C at the Record Plant in New York City and came up with this song, based on the unsavory characters near their hotel on Eighth Avenue. In his memoir, Tyler explains that the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;came from the seedy area where we recorded the album. &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; was about a pimp and the wildlife out on the street.&quot; Tyler plays the piano on the track, the opening beat of which is similar to the one Kramer would play a year later in &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. The title was a pun on the famous William Golding novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and &quot;the critics hated us for this. We weren&#x27;t supposed to be smart enough to use literary references.&quot; Douglas remembers the atmosphere that inspired the lyrics: 

The cover of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; was previously made popular by one of Aerosmith&#x27;s favorite bands, the Yardbirds. Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had performed the song prior to joining Aerosmith. Perry stated that &quot;Train&quot; was the one song &quot;we all had in common when we came together.&quot; Steven&#x27;s band had played &#x27;Train&#x27; and Tom and I played it in our band ... It&#x27;s a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back ... I always thought if I could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me&quot;. Perry&#x27;s band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of &quot;Stroll On&quot; in &quot;Blowup&quot;; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: &quot;I had seen the Yardbirds play somewhere the previous summer with both Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page in the band ... In Westport [at their supporting gig on October 22, 1966] we found out that Jeff had left the band and Jimmy was playing lead guitar by himself. I watched him from the edge of the stage and all I can say is that he knocked my tits off. They did &#x27;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&#x27; and it was just so heavy. They were just an un-fuckin&#x27;-believable band. The song was an early feature of Aerosmith&#x27;s concerts and a frequent show closer, including for their first gig in 1970. Notable for its start/stop groove, the song became a core part of the band&#x27;s live set for a time, and still occasionally ended concerts late in their career. In 1997, drummer Joey Kramer explained to Alan Di Perna of &quot;Guitar World&quot; that its unique rhythmic feel originated &quot;probably just from jamming on it at soundcheck and experimenting with putting a James Brown kind of beat behind it. I played with a lot of R&amp;B-type groups before joining Aerosmith.&quot;

Tyler recounts writing &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; in his memoir: &quot;When I wrote the music to &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; I grabbed the old acoustic guitar Joey found in the garbage on Beacon Street with no strings. I put four strings on it, which is all it would take because it was so warped, went to the basement, and tried to find the words to match the scat sounds in my head, like automatic writing. The place was a mess, and I moved all the shit aside, put a rug down, popped three Tuinals, snorted some blow, sat down on the floor, tuned the guitar to that tuning, that special tuning that I thought I came up with. He continues, &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; was about the winter landscape near this house I was living in with Joey near an old chicken farm. I used to lie in my bed at dawn, listening to the wind in the bare trees, how lonely and melancholy it sounded. One night I went down to the basement where we had a rug on the floor and a couple of boxes for furniture and took a few Tuinals and a few Seconals and I scooped up this guitar Joey gave me, this dumpster guitar, and I lit some incense and wrote &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot;.&quot; 

The closing &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was originally written by Kramer, who recalled in 1997: &quot;The summer before, we&#x27;d rented a farmhouse in East Thetford, Vermont, while we were rehearsing in New Hampshire, and that&#x27;s where I wrote the melody of &#x27;Pandora&#x27;s Box.&#x27; Steven wrote the lines about women&#x27;s liberation, a big new issue in those times.&quot; According to Douglas, the clarinet at the start of the track is a union engineer playing &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;Get Your Wings&quot; was recorded at the Record Plant in New York City between December 1973 and January 1974. Jack Douglas served as producer and Jay Messina engineered the sessions. Douglas, a Record Plant engineer, had previously worked with The Who, John Lennon and Patti Smith. Douglas was asked by Aerosmith&#x27;s managers Leber and Krebs to produce the sessions after success engineering the debut for one of their other artists, The New York Dolls. Douglas lived in Greenwich Village and hung out at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and had close relationships with the Dolls, Patti Smith, Lou Reed and other members of that artistic community. After successfully reigning in the rambuctious and drug-addled New York Dolls, Douglas remembers Aerosmith&#x27;s managers asking, &quot;&#x27;Maybe you&#x27;d like to take a look at our baby band?&#x27; which was Aerosmith. &#x27;We don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re going any good or not!...&#x27; I said &#x27;Sure, send me off to Boston hear them!&#x27; Because of my love for the Yardbirds, after the show, we sat down, we started to talk about [Jimmy] Page and Eric [Clapton] and the guitar sound, the influence of the band. It turned out that we had so much in common, the band and myself, that we just hit it off. And so we started a very long relationship.&quot; According to Perry, Columbia had wanted the band to work with Bob Ezrin, who was also a producer with Alice Cooper. It was Ezrin who introduced the band to Douglas, and for &quot;all practical purposes, Jack became our producer. Ezrin might have shown up three or four times, but only to make suggestions, like bringing in additional musicians to augment our sound.&quot; Perry continues, 

Prior to the sessions, the band moved into an apartment in Brookline and began intensive rehearsals in a dungeon-like basement of a store called Drummer&#x27;s Image on Newbury Street. Douglas later recalled, &quot;To the best of my memory, the preproduction work for &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; started in the back of a restaurant that was like a Mob hangout in the North End. I commuted there from the Copley Plaza Hotel and they started to play me the songs they had for their new album. My attitude was: &#x27;What can I do to make them sound like themselves?&#x27;&quot; The rehearsals gave the group time to write additional material and finalize the songs for the album prior to going into the studio. Douglas explains, 

Douglas invited outside guitarists and a saxophone player to play on some of the tracks. &quot;On &#x27;Same Old Song And Dance&#x27;, I told them that we should bring in some horns to bring out their rhythm and blues side,&quot; said producer Jack Douglas. &quot;They definitely had that kind of style and sound already. We got the Brecker Brothers to play on that. The sax solo is Michael Brecker.&quot; Session guitarist and member of Alice Cooper, Dick Wagner, plays the guitar solo on &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot;, and also contributes guitars along with Steve Hunter to &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;. Wagner remembers playing on &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; and a couple other tracks: &quot;Joe hadn&#x27;t yet developed into the player he is today. He&#x27;s up in the big leagues now but back in those days the stuff was more simplistic. Obviously for some reason he wasn&#x27;t there to do it and I never really questioned it. At the time I was living at The Plaza Hotel in NYC just waiting for the phone to ring. It was either Ezrin or Jack Douglas who would call me up and ask me to come over. For that session Jack called me up at like ten o&#x27;clock in the evening and I went in and did it and that was it.&quot; In an interview, Brad Whitford confirms the use of outside guitarists on &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; as well as &quot;S.O.S. (Too Bad)&quot; and acknowledges that &quot;I don&#x27;t think I made it onto &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot;, either. It was Jack who had the difficult task of breaking the news to Joe and me, and of course, that went down like a lead balloon. At first you fight, and you&#x27;re a little bit angry, and then you get sad to where you&#x27;re like really bummed out that you can&#x27;t do it. And the thing was that we&#x27;d done some good stuff and could play good stuff, but the tracks required some real finesse, you know?&quot; Douglas explains the decision to bring in outside guitarists: 

For &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, the group desired to capture a live version of the song, but producer Jack Douglas persuaded them to record a studio version instead. The song was recorded in two parts, with the second half featuring a faux-live sound. According to Hunter, &quot;We wanted to keep the solos equal so we&#x27;d sit down and go through the material so it was totally even. We didn&#x27;t want it to look like there was a rhythm guitar player and a lead guitar player, because that&#x27;s what we both did&quot;. Hunter later elaborated: &quot;Aerosmith was in Studio C of The Record Plant and I was doing work with Bob Ezrin in Studio A. I had a long wait between dubs and was waiting in the lobby. Jack Douglas popped his head out of Studio C and asked &#x27;Hey, do you feel like playing?&#x27; I said sure, so I grabbed my guitar and went in. I had two run-throughs, then Jack said &#x27;great that&#x27;s it!&#x27; That turned out to be the opening solos on &#x27;Train Kept A Rollin&#x27;&quot;. According to Douglas, the crowd noise at the end of the track was taken from a &quot;wild track&quot; from &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, which he had worked on. The single version omits the echo and crowd noise. 

In a change from their debut album, Douglas insisted that Tyler use his natural singing voice on the record. Douglas explains, &quot;I insisted that Steven sing with his real voice. On that first album he had this voice that wasn&#x27;t even him. It was like a made up voice that he thought sounded English or something. I said, &#x27;You gotta be kidding me. With the pipes that you have, there&#x27;s no way you are going to sing, &quot;Dream On&quot;, that way. Let&#x27;s get back to your real voice.&#x27; When that album came out I got a lot of hate mail from fans saying what did you do to Steven&#x27;s voice, but it paid off, as did the ghost guitar players who taught Brad and Joe how to play those solos that were on the record. Note for note, here is how you do it. The band went out on the road for a year and came back to me to do &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;. When they came back they were totally different. They were great players.&quot;

In 2014, Perry reflected on the sessions, &quot;We all put in endless hours, fueled by whatever substances were available... I knew the album, in spite of a few bright spots, still didn&#x27;t capture the power of the band. We were better than the record we were making. And yet I didn&#x27;t know how to get there. I didn&#x27;t know how to get from good to great.&quot; &quot;On the second album,&quot; Tyler noted, &quot;the songs found my voice. I realized that it&#x27;s not about having a beautiful voice and hitting all the notes; it&#x27;s about attitude.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Contemporary reviews were mostly positive. In his article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Charley Walters praised the LP, writing that &quot;the snarling chords of guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford tautly propel each number, jibing neatly with the rawness of singer Steven Tyler, whose discipline is evident no matter how he shrieks, growls, or spits out the lyrics.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer called the music &quot;derivative&quot;, but added that the band&#x27;s &quot;tough and nasty rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll vision&quot; could be successful with the help of the right producers. Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the band were &quot;inheritors of the Grand Funk principle: if a band is going to be dumb, it might as well be American dumb. Here they&#x27;re loud and cunning enough to provide a real treat for the hearing-impaired, at least on side one.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine declared that &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; was when Aerosmith &quot;shed much of their influences and developed their own trademark sound, it&#x27;s where they turned into songwriters, it&#x27;s where Steven Tyler unveiled his signature obsessions with sex and sleaze... they&#x27;re doing their bloozy bluster better and bolder, which is what turns this sophomore effort into their first classic.&quot; Ben Mitchell of &quot;Blender&quot; had the same impression and wrote that Aerosmith locked into their &quot;trademark dirty funk&quot; and &quot;firmly established their simple lyrical blueprint: smut and high times&quot; on this album. Canadian critic Martin Popoff praised the album and called it a &quot;rich, inspired and consistently entertaining rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller, a record much more intelligent than much metal to this point in time&quot;.

<text>Sevanavank (; meaning &quot;Sevan Monastery&quot;) is a monastic complex located on a peninsula at the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan in the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia, not far from the town of Sevan. Initially the monastery was built at the southern shore of a small island. After the artificial draining of Lake Sevan, which started in the era of Joseph Stalin, the water level fell about 20 metres, and the island transformed into a peninsula. At the southern shore of this newly created peninsula, a guesthouse of the Armenian Writers&#x27; Union was built. The eastern shore is occupied by the Armenian president&#x27;s summer residence, while the monastery&#x27;s still active seminary moved to newly constructed buildings at the northern shore of the peninsula.

Due to easier accessibility (once it became a peninsula), good highway and railway connections with the Armenian capital Yerevan, a well-developed tourist industry in the nearby town of Sevan, and its picturesque location (although less picturesque than it was before the lake level drop), Sevanavank is one of the most visited tourism sights in Armenia.

==History==
According to an inscription in one of the churches, the monastery of Sevanavank was founded in 874 by Princess Mariam, the daughter of Ashot I (who became a king a decade later). At the time, Armenia was still struggling to free itself from Arab rule.

The monastery was strict as it was mainly intended for those monks from Etchmiadzin who had sinned. Jean-Marie Chopin, a French explorer of the Caucasus, visited there in 1830 and wrote of a regimen restraining from meat, wine, youth or women. Another explorer visited the monastery in 1850 and wrote of how manuscripts were still being copied manually.

==Architecture==
The two churches of the complex, Surp Arakelots meaning the &quot;Holy Apostles&quot; and Surp Astvatsatsin meaning the &quot;Holy Mother of God&quot;, are both cruciform plan structures with octagonal tambours. The two are quite similar to each other in appearance. Adjacent are the ruins of a gavit whose roof was originally supported by six wooden columns. Some of the remains of the gavit and its columns can be seen in the Yerevan Museum of History.

Reconstruction and restoration efforts took place from 1956 to 1957.

<doc id="987423" wikidata="Q421982" url="?curid=987423" title="Reducing sugar">
<text>A reducing sugar is any sugar that is capable of acting as a reducing agent. In an alkaline solution, a reducing sugar forms some aldehyde or ketone, which allows it to act as a reducing agent, for example in Benedict&#x27;s reagent. In such a reaction, the sugar becomes a carboxylic acid.

All monosaccharides are reducing sugars, along with some disaccharides, some oligosaccharides, and some polysaccharides. The monosaccharides can be divided into two groups: the aldoses, which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Ketoses must first tautomerize to aldoses before they can act as reducing sugars. The common dietary monosaccharides galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars.

Disaccharides are formed from two monosaccharides and can be classified as either reducing or nonreducing. Nonreducing disaccharides like sucrose and trehalose have glycosidic bonds between their anomeric carbons and thus cannot convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group; they are stuck in the cyclic form. Reducing disaccharides like lactose and maltose have only one of their two anomeric carbons involved in the glycosidic bond, while the other is free and can convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group.

The aldehyde functional group allows the sugar to act as a reducing agent, for example, in the Tollens&#x27; test or Benedict&#x27;s test. The cyclic hemiacetal forms of aldoses can open to reveal an aldehyde, and certain ketoses can undergo tautomerization to become aldoses. However, acetals, including those found in polysaccharide linkages, cannot easily become free aldehydes.

Reducing sugars react with amino acids in the Maillard reaction, a series of reactions that occurs while cooking food at high temperatures and that is important in determining the flavor of food. Also, the levels of reducing sugars in wine, juice, and sugarcane are indicative of the quality of these food products.

==Terminology==

===Oxidation-reduction===
A &quot;reducing sugar&quot; is one that &quot;reduces&quot; another compound and is itself &quot;oxidized&quot;; that is, the carbonyl carbon of the sugar is oxidized to a carboxyl group.

A sugar is classified as a reducing sugar only if it has an open-chain form with an aldehyde group or a free hemiacetal group.

===Aldoses and ketoses===
Monosaccharides which contain an aldehyde group are known as aldoses, and those with a ketone group are known as ketoses. The aldehyde can be oxidized via a redox reaction in which another compound is reduced. Thus, aldoses are reducing sugars. Sugars with ketone groups in their open chain form are capable of isomerizing via a series of tautomeric shifts to produce an aldehyde group in solution. Therefore, ketones like fructose are considered reducing sugars but it is the isomer containing an aldehyde group which is reducing since ketones cannot be oxidized without decomposition of the sugar. This type of isomerization is catalyzed by the base present in solutions which test for the presence of reducing sugars.

===Reducing end===
Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharides and may be either reducing or nonreducing. Even a reducing disaccharide will only have one reducing end, as disaccharides are held together by glycosidic bonds, which consist of at least one anomeric carbon. With one anomeric carbon unable to convert to the open-chain form, only the free anomeric carbon is available to reduce another compound, and it is called the &quot;reducing end&quot; of the disaccharide. 
A nonreducing disaccharide is that which has both anomeric carbons tied up in the glycosidic bond.

Similarly, most polysaccharides have only one reducing end.

==Examples==

All monosaccharides are reducing sugars because they either have an aldehyde group (if they are aldoses) or can tautomerize in solution to form an aldehyde group (if they are ketoses). This includes common monosaccharides like galactose, glucose, glyceraldehyde, fructose, ribose, and xylose.

Many disaccharides, like cellobiose, lactose, and maltose, also have a reducing form, as one of the two units may have an open-chain form with an aldehyde group. However, sucrose and trehalose, in which the anomeric carbon atoms of the two units are linked together, are nonreducing disaccharides since neither of the rings is capable of opening.

In glucose polymers such as starch and starch-derivatives like glucose syrup, maltodextrin and dextrin the macromolecule begins with a reducing sugar, a free aldehyde. When starch has been partially hydrolyzed the chains have been split and hence it contains more reducing sugars per gram. The percentage of reducing sugars present in these starch derivatives is called dextrose equivalent (DE).

Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose that serves as the main form of carbohydrate storage in animals. It is a reducing sugar with only one reducing end, no matter how large the glycogen molecule is or how many branches it has (note, however, that the unique reducing end is usually covalently linked to glycogenin and will therefore not be reducing). Each branch ends in a nonreducing sugar residue. When glycogen is broken down to be used as an energy source, glucose units are removed one at a time from the nonreducing ends by enzymes.

==Characterization==
Several qualitative tests are used to detect the presence of reducing sugars. Two of them use solutions of copper(II) ions: Benedict&#x27;s reagent (Cu2+ in aqueous sodium citrate) and Fehling&#x27;s solution (Cu2+ in aqueous sodium tartrate). The reducing sugar reduces the copper(II) ions in these test solutions to copper(I), which then forms a brick red copper(I) oxide precipitate. Reducing sugars can also be detected with the addition of Tollen&#x27;s reagent, which consist of silver ions (Ag+) in aqueous ammonia. When Tollen&#x27;s reagent is added to an aldehyde, it precipitates silver metal, often forming a silver mirror on clean glassware.

3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is another test reagent, one that allows quantitative detection. It reacts with a reducing sugar to form 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid, which can be measured by spectrophotometry to determine the amount of reducing sugar that was present.

Some sugars, such as sucrose, do not react with any of the reducing-sugar test solutions. However, a non-reducing sugar can be hydrolyzed using dilute hydrochloric acid. After hydrolysis and neutralization of the acid, the product may be a reducing sugar that gives normal reactions with the test solutions.

All carbohydrates are converted to aldehydes and respond positively in Molisch&#x27;s test. But the test has a faster rate when it comes to monosaccharides.

==Importance in medicine==
Fehling&#x27;s solution was used for many years as a diagnostic test for diabetes, a disease in which blood glucose levels are dangerously elevated by a failure to produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or by an inability to respond to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Measuring the amount of oxidizing agent (in this case, Fehling&#x27;s solution) reduced by glucose makes it possible to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood or urine. This then enables the right amount of insulin to be injected to bring blood glucose levels back into the normal range.

==Importance in food chemistry==

===Maillard reaction===
The carbonyl groups of reducing sugars react with the amino groups of amino acids in the Maillard reaction, a complex series of reactions that occurs when cooking food. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are diverse; some are beneficial to human health, while others are toxic. However, the overall effect of the Maillard reaction is to decrease the nutritional value of food. One example of a toxic product of the Maillard reaction is acrylamide, a neurotoxin and possible carcinogen that is formed from free asparagine and reducing sugars when cooking starchy foods at high temperatures (above 120 °C). However, evidence from epidemiological studies suggest that dietary acrylamide is unlikely to raise the risk of people developing cancer.

===Food quality===

The level of reducing sugars in wine, juice, and sugarcane are indicative of the quality of these food products, and monitoring the levels of reducing sugars during food production has improved market quality. The conventional method for doing so is the Lane-Eynon method, which involves titrating the reducing sugar with copper(II) in Fehling&#x27;s solution in the presence of methylene blue, a common redox indicator. However, it is inaccurate, expensive, and sensitive to impurities.

<doc id="987426" wikidata="Q4306583" url="?curid=987426" title="Music of Chad">
<text>Chad is an ethnically diverse Central African country. Each of its regions has its own unique varieties of music and dance. The Fulani people, for example, use single-reeded flutes, while the ancient griot tradition uses five-string kinde and various kinds of horns, and the Tibesti region uses lutes and fiddles. Musical ensembles playing horns and trumpets such as the long royal trumpets known as &quot;waza&quot; or &quot;kakaki&quot; are used in coronations and other upper-class ceremonies throughout both Chad and Sudan.

The national anthem of Chad is &quot;La Tchadienne,&quot; written in 1960 by Paul Villard and Louis Gidrol with help from Gidrol&#x27;s student group.

==Popular music==

Following independence, Chad, like most other African countries, quickly began producing some popular music, primarily in a style similar to the soukous music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Styles of Chadian popular music include sai, which used rhythms from the southern part of Chad—this style was popularized by a group called Tibesti. Other bands include the Sahel&#x27;s International Challal and African Melody, while musicians include the Sudanese-music-influenced guitarist Ahmed Pecos and Chadian-French musician Clément Masdongar.

==Folk music==
===Teda music===
The Teda live in the area around the Tibesti Mountains. Their folk music revolves around men&#x27;s string instruments and women&#x27;s vocal music. String instruments like the keleli are used to &quot;speak for&quot; male performers, since it is considered inappropriate for a man to sing in front of an adult woman.

===Instruments===

Traditional Chadian instruments include the hu hu (string instrument with calabash loudspeakers), kakaki (a tin horn), maracas, lute, kinde (a bow harp) and various kinds of horns. Other instruments include the flute and drums music of the Kanembu and the balaphone, whistle, harp and kodjo drums of the Sara people, while the Baguirmians are known for drum and zither music, as well as a folk dance in which a mock battle is conducted between dancers wielding large pestles.

<text>Craters of the Moon Thermal Area (or &quot;Karapiti&quot; in Māori language) is a region with geothermal activity north of Taupō, New Zealand. It is a part of Wairakei, the largest geothermal field in New Zealand, with a surface area of about 25 km2, which lies in the Taupō Volcanic Zone.
The name springs from the many hydrothermal eruption craters, which are in part barren and which have bright colours. Combined with the numerous steam vents, constantly shifting, collapsing and reforming giving the whole area desolate appearance, and the sulphur smell, the whole area has an “unearthly” atmosphere. 
The craters are a relatively recent feature of the area and appeared as a result of human activity in the region.

The site is Crown Land, administered by the Department of Conservation, with help from the &quot;Craters of the Moon Trust&quot;, a volunteer organisation that provides information for visitors and passive vehicle security.

==History==
In 1859 Ferdinand von Hochstetter, an Austrian geologist who traveled through the area, reported a colossal column of steam from the Karapiti Blowhole (fumarole), observable from about 20 km away. It was difficult to approach because steam vents and springs covered the valley floor and the ground was warm, soft, iron-stained clay for great distances around. By the beginning of the 20th century the Blowhole was a tourist attraction, albeit not of the level of the nearby Wairakei Geyser Valley. It is worthwhile reading the “Impression of a Trip” in 1927, in which the Karapiti Blowhole is named “the safety valve of the North Island”:
:”After dinner (which was served at 6 p.m.) we took our seats in the car which went to Karapeeti (the safety valve of the North Island) and the “Huka” falls, a little higher up the Waikato.
:Karapeeti blow hole is an escaping volume of superheated steam with a pressure of 180 lbs. to the square inch coming through an aperture two feet by one foot. The guide lit a sack sprinkled with kerosene so that the visitors could see the escaping steam in the darkness and after the sack had partly burnt away he picked it up on a stick and shook the burning pieces down into the blow hole. These were immediately carried up in the jet of steam and presented a very weird fireworks effect, the sparks remaining alight, proving that it was super-heated or dry steam. This blow hole, according to Maori tradition, has been constant for the last 200 years and the Maoris of the early days of New Zealand used this column of steam as a beacon to guide them with their canoes across Lake Taupo which is six miles distant.”
An information leaflet of New Zealand Railways of 1940 speaks about the “Inferno of Karapiti”. The phenomenon was usually viewed at night. A piece of smouldering sacking was applied to the blowhole. Then the “jet, filled with smoke and burning shreds becomes a whirling inverted cone flashing with thousands of yellow sparks in a brilliant pyrotechnic display”.

In 1950 the area was described as being mostly warm clay with small patches of hot ground and mudpools. “The Karapiti Blowhole was still impressive, though apparently much less intense than when Hochstetter saw it”.

A most important change in the region has been the building of the Wairakei Power Station (150 MW) in the 1950s, about 2 km. north of the field. This reduced the pressure in the hot water systems below the earth surface. 
Since then much of the geothermal activity in the region has dramatically changed, as did the geothermal activity at Craters of the Moon. The geysers at Wairakei Geyser Valley totally disappeared, but the heat output at Craters of the Moon increased. A lot of hydrothermal eruptions occurred, which formed the craters.

In 1950, the total heat output at Craters of the Moon was about 40 MW (megawatts). By 1958, it had increased to about 90 MW. In 1964 it was 420 MW. After 1964 the output declined to about 220 MW in 1979. The most recent estimate being about 200 MW in 2000.

Heat output from the Karapiti Blowhole followed a similar pattern. In the 1950 it was 12 MW. It increased to a maximum of about 38 MW during the mid 1960s. Then it dropped to about 7 MW in 1978. The blowhole finally ceased altogether in 1987.

==Features of Craters of the Moon==
Craters of the Moon is a steam field with a total of about of heated ground. It has an average altitude of 435 m. It has – of course – craters, but it also has fumaroles (“blowholes”) and a mudpool. Vegetation around the area of the Craters of the Moon is quite uncommon.

===Craters===
All the craters at The Craters of the Moon are the result of hydrothermal eruptions. The pressure of the steam beneath the surface exceeds the pressure exerted by the weight of the overlying ground. This results in an explosion. A mixture of hot water, steam, hot mud and pumice is ejected into the air. Material may be blown up to 100 m, leaving behind holes or craters as deep as 20 m. Hydrothermal eruptions occur about once a year.

===Fumaroles===
The openings in the earth surface, where geothermal steam and gases are emitted, are called fumaroles. These vary in size from one centimetre to half a meter in diameter.

The most powerful fumarole observed at Craters of the Moon occurred December 1967. It had a heat output of 116 MW.

===Mudpool===
Currently, only one of the craters has a mudpool. Here the gases (mainly H2S) react with water to form sulphuric acid. This reacts with the rocks, turning it to clay. When there is water present, this forms the grey coloured mudpools “that bubble and burp as steam and gas escape through them”.

==Vegetation==
Much of the ground at Craters of the Moon is warm or hot. This of course affects the vegetation. Only few species can survive. One is the &quot;prostrate kanuka&quot;, a variety of kanuka (&quot;Kunzea ericoides&quot; var. &quot;microflora&quot;). Other species include ferns and mosses that usually grow only in the tropics or warmer frost-free climates.

==Visitor access to Craters of the Moon==
Craters of the Moon is open to visitors all year round. The area is easily reached by car from Taupō, being on the end of Karapiti Road, that branches off State Highway 1/5, 4 km north of Taupō. There is a carpark, and an information kiosk at the entrance. An entrance fee applies.

Visitors can walk a main track circuit, suited for people of all ages and fitness levels, which is also wheelchair accessible. This loop takes 45 minutes to walk. A steeper loop, taking an additional 20 minutes, climbs to a viewing point. Due to the somewhat poisonous fumes and the fact that ground temperatures around steam vents can reach dangerous levels, the paths and board walkways that allow access to the field are relaid at irregular intervals to bypass them.

==Craters of the Moon Trust==
In 1991 the constant break-ins in cars at the rather isolated car park caused local solicitor Jeremy Nash to seek volunteers to maintain passive security. In that same year a first kiosk was built near the entrance. In 2000 a bigger kiosk was opened. 
In 2000 the Trust opened a similar kiosk and passive vehicle security at the famous Huka Falls.

<text>Mount Charleston, including Charleston Peak (Nuvagantu, literally &quot;where snow sits&quot;, in Southern Paiute or Nüpakatütün in Shoshoni) at , is the highest mountain in both the Spring Mountains and Clark County, in Nevada, United States. It is the eighth-highest mountain in the state. Well separated from higher peaks by large, low basins, Charleston Peak is the most topographically prominent peak in Nevada, and the eighth-most-prominent peak in the contiguous United States. It is one of eight ultra-prominent peaks in Nevada. It is located about northwest of Las Vegas within the Mount Charleston Wilderness, which is within the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area of the Humboldt–Toiyabe National Forest.

==Overview==
Mount Charleston is a year-round getaway for Las Vegas&#x27;s residents and visitors, with a number of hiking trails, a modest ski area, a hotel and a small restaurant. The mountain, which is snow-capped more than half the year, can be seen from parts of the Las Vegas Strip when looking toward the west. Mount Charleston has nearly 200 camp sites and over 150 picnic areas, some of which are RV-accessible.

The village of Mount Charleston, Nevada, lies at its base to the east.

The state of Nevada issues license plates with the caption &quot;Mt. Charleston&quot; and an image of the peak in the background. Sales of the plate supports the natural environment of the Mount Charleston area through grants administered by the Nevada Division of State Lands.

According to the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, Mount Charleston was named for Charleston, South Carolina by Southerners.

==Climate==
==Plane crash==
Near its summit are the remnants of the 1955 crash of a CIA C-54 Military Air Transport Service plane. The plane was on route on November 17, 1955, from Burbank (location of Lockheed&#x27;s Skunkworks), to Groom Lake (Area 51) (then known as Watertown Strip) to work on the secret U-2 plane development. Fourteen men (a mix of military staffers and civilian subcontractors, engineers, and technicians) were on board when it crashed during a blizzard, all of whom died. There are still remains from the plane that can be hiked to just off the main southern loop trail to the peak.

The Silent Heroes of the Cold War Memorial was installed at the Spring Mountains Visitor Gateway in 2015. It features a propeller from the downed aircraft (which was recovered decades later from the crash site) and a granite monument.

== Hiking ==

Charleston Peak is a popular destination for hikers. The summit offers panoramic views from the Sierra Nevada, Death Valley, and Las Vegas. There are two well-marked and well-maintained trails to the summit: South Loop Trail and North Loop Trail. The trails can be done on their own as an out-and-back hike, or combined as a loop. Both approaches involve a strenuous 16-mile+ round trip with over 4000 feet of climbing. The hike often takes all day. The hike is most accessible in the snow-free months of summer and fall.

<text>The Republic of the Congo is an African nation with close musical ties to its neighbor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s homegrown pop music, soukous, is popular across the border, and musicians from both countries have fluidly travelled throughout the region playing similarly styled music, including Nino Malapet and Jean Serge Essous. Brazzaville had a major music scene until unrest in the late 1990s, and produced popular bands like Extra Musica and Bantous de la Capitale that played an integral role in the development of soukous and other styles of Congolese popular music . The Hip-Hop group &quot;Bisso na Bisso&quot; also hails from Congo-Brazzaville.

==National music==
The national anthem of the Republic of the Congo is &#x27;. It was adopted upon independence in 1959, replaced in 1969 by &#x27; but reinstated in 1991. The words were written by Jacques Tondra and Georges Kibanghi, the music was composed by Jean Royer and Joseph Spadilière.

==Traditional music==
Folk instruments in the Republic of the Congo include the xylophone and &quot;mvet&quot;. The mvet is a kind of zither-harp, similar to styles found elsewhere in both Africa and Asia. The mvet is made of a long tube with one or two gourds acting as resonators .

==Soukous==
Though soukous has become much more closely associated with the popular music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, early in the style&#x27;s evolution both the local scenes of Kinshasa and Brazzaville played a very important role. In these cities, American style orchestras (called &quot;soukous&quot;, or &quot;kirikiri&quot; or &quot;kasongo&quot;) played rumba (a kind of Cuban music) influenced by traditional music and jazz. Soukous arose from this fusion of styles, popularized as dance music by a number of different orchestras in the 1950s and 60s.

<doc id="987451" wikidata="Q3278410" url="?curid=987451" title="Short Bus (album)">
<text>Short Bus is the debut studio album by American rock band Filter, released on April 25, 1995, via Reprise Records. Lead singer Richard Patrick said in an interview that Trent Reznor had told him he should make his own record while he went off to work on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 1994 album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Patrick, while still retaining industrial elements in the music, chose to focus on the guitars, which he felt was something missing when he played with Nine Inch Nails; he also chose not to go with the standard industrial rock sound, which he felt would set them apart.

&quot;Short Bus&quot; has sold over one million copies in the United States, and is best known for the hit single &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot;.

==Background and recording==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Richard Patrick was a touring guitarist for Nine Inch Nails. Patrick and musician Brian Liesegang initially conceived the idea of forming their own band after hiking at the Grand Canyon; Filter was subsequently formed in 1993. The line-up also briefly featured guitarist Stuart Zechman, who departed Filter to join Stabbing Westward. Stabbing Westward reportedly used the chorus guitar riff of &quot;Hey Man, Nice Shot&quot; on the title track of their 1994 album, &quot;Ungod&quot;; Patrick alleges that Zechman was in his presence while writing the riff and subsequently copied it.

Before obtaining a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, Patrick had demoed some of the &quot;Short Bus&quot; tracks such as &quot;Under&quot; and &quot;Dose&quot; on his 8-track reel-to-reel recorder. A demo of &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot; was recorded at Reznor&#x27;s studio; the recordings from this session were later remixed by Ben Grosse. Three of the early recordings, including &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot,&quot; were featured on 1994 promo EP, &quot;Erkenntnistheorie&quot;.

During the recording sessions, two musicians shared various roles: Patrick acted as the primary songwriter, bassist, and vocalist, while Liesegang mostly worked on the production and programmed the drum machine. The two shared guitar duties. A large portion of the album was recorded at a rented three-story house in Rocky River, Cleveland; the master bedroom was designated as the main studio while the basement and living room were reserved for the drum kit and guitar amps, respectively. The sessions lasted around eight months; a Macintosh Quadra and Studio Vision Pro were used to record some of the tracks. Half of the album&#x27;s tracks, including “Gerbil” and “White Like That,” were recorded on an 8-track recorder. While Ben Grosse was employed to mix the record to &quot;give girth&quot; to its sound, the band chose to master the record themselves: the mixes were tested on &quot;consumer-level gear&quot; such as car stereo and boombox for reference. According to Patrick, the house was demolished after the band&#x27;s departure and the property was incorporated into the adjacent nursing home.

==Composition and lyrics==
Described as an industrial rock, post-grunge, hard rock, and nu metal record, &quot;Short Bus&quot; blends the industrial sound with grunge music. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; writer Essi Berelian described the record as &quot;a broad and imaginative slab of industrial noise, distinguished by Patrick&#x27;s ability with a strong hook and melodic chorus.&quot; Richard Patrick has gone on to name bands such as Pantera, Butthole Surfers and Skinny Puppy as influences on the album&#x27;s sound; Deftones, Helmet and Soundgarden were also other early influences on Filter. The album&#x27;s guitar-heavy sound features the use of a drum machine for percussion; the band&#x27;s adoption of the digital instrument was influenced by the works of Big Black and Ministry&#x27;s 1988 record, &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;. Music software was also used to process guitars and other sounds; the verses of &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot; featured a looped feedback of a pick stratch. The band also incorporated the sounds of a broken toilet on the track &quot;Stuck in Here.&quot; The track &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; features a guitar drop that was recorded on a low-quality mini-cassette recorder; Liesegang has described the resulting recording as &quot;Robert Johnson spooky kind of sound.&quot; Other incorporated sounds on the record include answering machine vocals on &quot;Spent&quot; and television recordings on &quot;White Like That.&quot;

Lyrical themes include religion and suicide, with the album&#x27;s opening track and lead single &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot; being written as a response to Budd Dwyer&#x27;s televised suicide. The track was, at one point, rumored to be about the death of musician Kurt Cobain; however, the band has denied said rumor in the past. Similarly, &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; was written about a mutual friend of the band who died by suicide, and was one of the first few songs written by the group. The album is named after the slang &quot;short bus,&quot; which refers to the smaller school busses used by students with disabilities. Liesegang stated that the band chose the title for solidarity and reclamation.

==Packaging==
The album was released with artwork similar to that of a package, with the tracklist and barcode being part of the front cover. Some pressings included a photo on the back tray, while others simply featured a tracklist against a bare background. The minimalist design was done in homage to Public Image LTD&#x27;s 1986 recording &quot;Album&quot;.

An expanded edition was released by Concord Music on November 2, 2018. This version replaces the Reprise Records logo with that of Craft Recordings, which is Concord&#x27;s reissue label. This version adds six new mixes: two of &quot;Dose&quot;, three of &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot;, and one of &quot;White Like That&quot;.

==Promotion and touring==
The album spawned three singles (&quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot;, &quot;Dose&quot;, and &quot;Under&quot;) with the first two receiving music videos that featured an expanded line-up. The line-up included guitarist Geno Lenardo, bassist Frank Cavanagh, and drummer Matt Walker, who were all hired to back up Patrick and Liesegang for live shows. To promote &quot;Short Bus&quot;, the band would tour the United States, with footage taken during this time period later being released used for the 1996 Filter documentary &quot;Phenomenology&quot;.

Although originally intended to be touring members, Lenardo and Cavanagh would eventually join the band as full-time members to work on their 1999 follow-up album &quot;Title of Record&quot;.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung praised the record, stating: &quot;Filter never sounded quite like this again and &quot;Short Bus&quot; wound up being a singular snapshot cemented in time, a sleeper hit that became an enduring genre touchstone.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Greg Kot stated that the record &quot;finds a middle ground between grunge&#x27;s world-weary sense of melody and industrial rock&#x27;s icy steel-pulse rhythms;&quot; Kot further stated that the record &quot;otherwise fails to take its Nails-Nirvana hybrid beyond the formula.&quot;

The album was featured on &quot;Loudwire&quot;″s list of &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1995&quot;.

<doc id="987454" wikidata="Q3509641" url="?curid=987454" title="Roy Slater">
<text>Roy Slater (born 15 May 1948) is a recurring character in the British sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. He was played by Jim Broadbent, and in the prequel &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; by Calum MacNab.

==&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;==
===Background===
Despite only making three on-screen appearances, Slater&#x27;s background is revealed in detail during the course of the show&#x27;s history.

As a child, Slater attempted to be part of Del Boy&#x27;s gang at school as they used to sit next to each other in class; but he was always a loner, hated amongst his peers and infamous for his deceitful nature. Eventually, out of bitterness for the others&#x27; ostracising him, Slater joined the police force at the age of 18 and frequently engaged in unethical activity to try to frame and prosecute not just his old school friends but anyone possible – including his own family, as revealed in &quot;May the Force Be with You&quot;.

His own ego would eventually turn him to crime: leading him into diamond smuggling, which is the main focus of the episode &quot;To Hull and Back&quot; and a strong part feature of the plot to &quot;The Class of &#x27;62&quot;. His initial prosecution for diamond smuggling landed him a five-year prison sentence.

Del&#x27;s domestic partner Raquel Turner is revealed to be Slater&#x27;s ex-wife in &quot;The Class of &#x27;62&quot;; he was married to her for four years before separating. Throughout the show&#x27;s history Raquel would frequently comment how nasty he could be as a husband.

===&quot;May the Force Be with You&quot;===
Slater is introduced in &quot;May the Force Be with You&quot;, the fifth episode of series three, having recently been promoted to the position of Detective Inspector. He has returned to Peckham and is investigating the theft of a microwave oven which turns out to be connected to Del.

The personality of his character and specific details of his past are revealed in this episode, including his feud with his peers, his dishonest practices and his generally villainous behaviour. As well as the main characters making clear their thoughts and attitudes towards him, his own colleague PC Terry Hoskins reveals that even his peers in the police service reject him, and Slater admits during the episode to having arrested his own father in the past (for riding a bicycle with a defective rear light), alienating him from his family.

===&quot;To Hull and Back&quot;===
Slater is the main antagonist in &quot;To Hull and Back&quot;, his involvement in crime is the main focus of the storyline, with the Trotters becoming involved in a diamond smuggling operation part-headed – unbeknownst to them – by Slater.

His position of authority within the police has been exploited a number of times to successfully smuggle diamonds into England, and over the course of the episode he almost succeeds again, only to be thwarted by Hoskins who drives him into a sting and lands Slater with a five-year prison sentence.

===&quot;The Class of &#x27;62&quot;===
Slater&#x27;s final appearance in character was in &quot;The Class of &#x27;62&quot;, in which he has been paroled from prison after three and a half years of his five-year sentence and returns to Peckham, setting up a school reunion to which Del, Boycie, Trigger, and Denzil are invited, with Rodney joining them.

Over the course of the episode, it is learnt that Del&#x27;s girlfriend Raquel is Slater&#x27;s ex-wife, and the school reunion was merely a set-up to gain contact with her regarding his divorce proceedings, as he knew from the start that she was living with Del. It is also revealed that Slater has returned to the illegal diamond trade, which Del and Rodney use to blackmail Slater into giving Raquel a fair divorce, no longer pestering her and leaving Peckham for good, under the threat of them informing the police about Slater&#x27;s return to crime. This prompts Slater&#x27;s departure from the series.

Slater appears once more in the series but not in a character appearance, in the final episode &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot; when Del and Rodney are given an old photograph of the very first Jolly Boys&#x27; outing from 1960, in which Slater is pictured. The first Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing forms part of the storyline of the prequel series &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, which features a young Slater.

The character of Slater was based on another corrupt police officer in Sullivan&#x27;s previous series Citizen Smith, PC Tofkin played by John Tordoff.

== &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; ==
A young Slater is shown in the prequel series Rock &amp; Chips, played by Calum MacNab. Slater is initially shown as a prefect at school, trying to intimidate Del and his gang but ultimately being insulted by both the gang and his superiors from whom he attempts to gain friendship.

He is part of the first Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing as noted at the end of Sleepless in Peckham, in which he is tricked into taking drugs and passes out before they reach their destination. Over the course of the series, he joins the police cadets and attempts to arrest Del and Jumbo Mills in the market for selling illegally imported records. He takes them to the station, only to be denied a bona fide arrest and ignored by his superior Sgt Foster, who also lets Del and Jumbo off with a warning and seizes their records.

<text>British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was the rolling stock manufacturing and maintenance subsidiary of British Rail.

It was established on 1 January 1970 by the British Railways Board to operate its 14 rolling stock maintenance centres and to provide construction, maintenance, and repair services to Britain’s railways. A key activity of BREL was the manufacturing of new rolling stock, such as the InterCity 125 trainset, the Mark 3 carriage, and the British Rail Class 58 freight locomotive. Both domestic and international sales were pursued; rolling stock produced by BREL was exported to various nations, including Ireland, Kenya, Gabon, Taiwan, Sweden, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Thailand, and Bangladesh. Numerous projects were undertaken on a collaborative basis with private sector manufacturers, including Brush Traction, Metro-Cammell, and Metropolitan-Vickers. BREL also built numerous prototype rail vehicles, such as the Class 140 and Class 210 DEMUs and the experimental high-speed Advanced Passenger Train (APT) tilting train.

Throughout the 1980s, BREL was subjected to repeated restructuring and job cuts; various works, such as Ashford, Shildon, and Swindon were closed permanently. The organisation was effectively cut in two when the maintenance arm was split off as British Rail Maintenance Limited in 1987. The British government sought to make BREL more internationally competitive. The design and building of trains was privatised in 1989, purchased by the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri (40%), Trafalgar House (40%), and a management-employee buy-out (20%). After ABB became the sole shareholder in September 1992, it was subsumed into ABB Transportation.

==History==

BREL was established by the British Railways Board on 1 January 1970 to take over the management of its 14 rolling stock maintenance centres, including Ashford, Crewe, Derby Litchurch Lane, Derby Locomotive, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Glasgow, Horwich, Shildon, Swindon, Wolverton, and York. The principal object of BREL was the provision of a construction, maintenance, and repair services to Britain’s railways.

A key activity of BREL was the manufacturing of new rolling stock for use by British Rail. Amongst those rail vehicles is the InterCity 125 trainset; produced between 1975 and 1982 and commonly referred to as the &quot;High Speed Train&quot;, was a diesel-powered high speed passenger train that travelled faster than any previous production British train. In addition to production types, BREL built numerous prototypes, such as the Class 210 DEMU and the experimental high-speed Advanced Passenger Train (APT) tilting train.

BREL did not have a monopoly on the manufacture of new rail vehicles; various private companies, such as Brush Traction, Metro-Cammell, and Metropolitan-Vickers amongst others, also manufactured rolling stock for British Rail, although in general, it was built to specifications produced by BREL. Furthermore, BREL often acted as a subcontractor to a main contractor, such as GEC, which supplied traction equipment. These contracts typically required BREL to build the frames, body shells, and bogies and install the traction and ancillary equipment of the primary contractor. The majority of the electric locomotive construction programmes of the 1980s, such as Classes 89, 90, and 91, was carried out in this manner. The Sprinter and Pacer families of diesel multiple-units (DMUs) were also manufactured with an emphasis on collaboration and competitive forces.

In addition to the domestic market, BREL pursued international sales. The Mark 2 carriage proved to be attractive abroad, and derivatives were exported to Ireland, Kenya, and Taiwan. BREL&#x27;s entry to the Chinese market in the late 1980s was hoped to lead to expansive orders for as many as 1,500 carriages. Freight wagons of various sorts were produced for overseas customers in Sweden, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, and Bangladesh. BREL was also a major supplier of components and general engineering equipment to numerous businesses that were not primarily involved in railways, such as the British Steel Corporation. During the 1980s, BREL produced the British Rail Class 58 freight locomotive, which it had developed with the intention of attracting international orders.

Throughout the 1980s, various sites operated by BREL were permanently closed, including Ashford Works in 1981, Shildon in 1984, and Swindon in 1986. During 1987, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Glasgow, and Wolverton were transferred to the newly created &quot;BR Maintenance&quot;. The maintenance requirements of British Rail&#x27;s rolling stock was reduced as newer vehicles, such as the Mark 3 carriages, were introduced that were designed to minimise operating costs; British Rail also progressively increased its use of electric traction which required less maintenance than diesel-powered trains, further reducing demand for BREL&#x27;s services and leading to cuts in personnel employed by the organisation. The loss of such jobs and the closure of certain sites became a politically charged matter during the late 1980s, which included threats of industrial action and allegations of insufficient investment.

As early as 1986, the British government were examining operations to privatise BREL and make it more competitive on the international market. The Secretary of State for Transport announced on 24 November 1987 that BREL would be sold, with a plan to invite offers by the spring of 1988. Accordingly, amid the wider privatisation of British Rail during the 1990s, BREL was sold via a management buyout, with management and employees owning 20% and Asea Brown Boveri and Trafalgar House 40% each. At the time of the management buyout, BREL&#x27;s locations comprised Crewe, York, and two separate works in Derby; Derby Locomotive Works was closed in 1991. In March 1992, ABB bought out the other shareholders, making BREL a wholly-owned subsidiary. It was subsumed into ABB Transportation in September 1992.

==Products==
The vast majority of BREL&#x27;s output was rolling stock for British Rail, including Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages, the latter for locomotive haulage and InterCity 125 diesel High-Speed Trains. BREL built the NIR 80 Class diesel-electric multiple units for Northern Ireland Railways. Other Mark 3 derived vehicles included Class 150 diesel multiple units in the 1980s and numerous electric multiple units such as Classes 313 and 317.

BREL had success in the export market, notably with Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages for Iarnród Éireann and the Taiwan Railway EMU100 series. Rolling stock was also manufactured for Ghana, Kenya, Malaysia, and Tanzania.

<text>Their System Doesn&#x27;t Work for You is a compilation album by punk band Anti-Flag, released in 1998. It was the first album released by the band&#x27;s label A-F Records.

== Background ==
It is a reprint of the nine Anti-Flag songs available on their split album North America Sucks, plus 10 unreleased tracks. The first 10 songs were recorded during the Die for the Government sessions in the spring of 1996. Only 1000 copies of the split were released originally, and the band was unable to press anymore. As a result, they decided to rerelease the songs themselves due to the overwhelming requests from fans. As an added bonus for the fans, they decided to include rare songs from the band&#x27;s first shows at WRUW in Cleveland, OH in 1994 and 1995. These are the last songs to feature Andy Flag on vocals and bass, as he left after the release of the split. By the time the album was released, the band had grown to include Chris Head on guitar and Jamie &quot;Cock&quot; Towns on bass.

== Song Info ==
I Can&#x27;t Stand Being with You attacks the narrator&#x27;s former friend who has betrayed their ideals and values to become &quot;a pop culture whore&quot;. The song was influenced by a quote from Jello Biofra, &quot;You became the one you set out to destroy&quot;. The title track is a politically charged track in vein with the band&#x27;s other works, attacking the people who blindly follow the government and media&#x27;s rules and advice without being their own person. We&#x27;ve Got His Gun is an anti-gun track written by Andy about a friend who accidentally killed himself with his father&#x27;s gun. Born to Die describes young kids struggling in bad circumstances. It was apparently seen by some right-wing fans as endorsing suicide, which led Justin to include a note in the album booklet disputing that view and explaining &quot;This song is a statement about the pressures of society...which push many youth to the point of hopelessness.&quot;

The Truth attacks the media for their role in the Persian Gulf War, while You&#x27;ll Scream Tonight additionally attacks the sexism and propaganda on television. The song is one of the more unique songs in Anti-Flag&#x27;s catalog, being much slower and darker than their other songs during this time. Indie Sux is a joke track that mocks the stereotypes in the Indie, Hardline, and Emo communities. Justin wrote a note explaining that the song &quot;was written in good fun&quot;. He went on to explain that the lines about hardline punks were the only serious part of the song, as he did not support the &quot;jock-like&quot; attitudes they had towards people who didn&#x27;t support them.

Anti-Violent is about artists who mutilate themselves, use steroids, and hit on young girls. The song 20 Years of Hell was an unreleased track recorded during the same sessions as the other songs. Justin described the song as being about his friends going through rough times and struggling. I&#x27;m Having a Good Day is another joke track.

Many of the remaining songs were included in two of the band&#x27;s demos released in 1994 and 1995. I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Like You is a live version of the same song featured on the band&#x27;s first split, Rockin With Father Mike. Betty Sue Is Dead was also featured on their first demo, and describes a woman who was killed in 1953 because she was bisexual. A studio version of I&#x27;m Feeling Slightly Violent was released on the compilation album, Iron City Punk.

== Release ==
Instead of releasing the album on another label, the band decided to form their own record label to release it, A-F Records. The band would go on to use the label as an opportunity to showcase different Pittsburgh punk bands. The band would also use it to release their next album, A New Kind of Army and various subsequent releases.

<doc id="987467" wikidata="Q6824798" url="?curid=987467" title="Cumberland Highway">
<text>Cumberland Highway is a long urban highway located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The highway links Pacific Highway and Pacific Motorway (M1) at Pearces Corner, Wahroonga in the northeast with Hume Highway at Liverpool in the southwest. 

This name covers a few consecutive roads and is widely known to most drivers, but the entire allocation is also known – and signposted – by the names of its constituent parts: [[Pennant Hills Road]], [[James Ruse Drive]], Briens Road, [[Old Windsor Road]], Hart Drive, Freame Street, Emert Street, Jersey Road, Betts Road, Warren Road, Smithfield Road, Palmerston Road, (New) Cambridge Street, Joseph Street and Orange Grove Road. The entire length of Cumberland Highway is designated part of route A28.

The name of the highway is derived from the Cumberland Plain and Cumberland County. The name &quot;Cumberland&quot; was conferred on the county by Governor Arthur Phillip in honour of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.

==Route==

Cumberland Highway commences at Pearces Corner – the intersection of Pacific Highway and Pennant Hills Road at Wahroonga – as Pennant Hills Road and heads in a southwesterly direction as a dual-carriageway, six-lane road, through Pennant Hills, narrowing to a single-carriageway, four-lane road through Carlingford, before reaching the interchange with James Ruse Drive. 

Cumberland Highway then follows James Ruse Drive westwards as a dual-carriageway, six-lane road to the interchange with Windsor Road in Northmead, where it changes name to Briens Road and continues west until it intersects with and changes name to Old Windsor Road, shortly afterwards reaching the intersection with Hart Drive at Constitution Hill. 

Cumberland Highway then follows Hart Drive in a southwesterly direction, changing name to Freame Street once it crosses under the North Shore and Western railway line in Wentworthville, and then intersects with and changes name to Emert Street shortly afterwards, before reaching the intersection with Great Western Highway. Cumberland Highway continues south as Jersey Road, then as Betts Road south of the intersection with Merrylands Road in Greystanes, then intersects with and changes name to Warren Road in Smithfield, heading in a southwesterly direction. 

After crossing Prospect Creek it changes name again to Smithfield Road, before heading south along Palmerston Road and narrowing to a four-lane road in Fairfield West, changing name again to New Cambridge Street south of the intersection with Hamilton Road, then intersects with and changes name to Cambridge Street through Canley Heights, before it intersects with and changes name to Joseph Street in Cabramatta, before finally changing name to Orange Grove Road south of the intersection with Cabramatta Road West. The highway eventually terminates at the intersection with Hume Highway in the northern fringes of Liverpool.

==History==

Cumberland Highway was created from a series of pre-existing roads through western and north-western suburban Sydney, not all contiguous at the time, with Pennant Hills Road in particular already declared as a major arterial route 60 years before it was eventually incorporated into the modern-day highway. The construction of a ring road around Parramatta and increasing traffic levels in western Sydney in the late 1970s became the precursor to today&#x27;s highway.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later the Department of Main Roads, and eventually Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 13 was declared on 8 August 1928, from the intersection with Great Northern Highway (today Pacific Highway) at Pearce&#x27;s Corner in Wahroonga, via Pennant Hills Road to Parramatta (and continuing south via Church Street and Woodville Road to the intersection with Great Southern Highway (today Hume Highway) at Lansdowne); with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 13 on 8 April 1929.

State Highway 13 eventually assumed the role of a western bypass of Sydney, made official when it was declared as part of Ring Road 5 in 1964. Ring Road 5 was superseded by State Route 55 in 1974, but by this stage, the growth of Sydney&#x27;s west had turned the bypass road into a primary arterial road with a huge increase in freight traffic.

In December 1981, Old Windsor Road was realigned at its southern end, to feed directly into Briens Road and the final section of the Parramatta Ring Road. This new road section would eventually form part of the Cumberland Highway a few years later.

In 1984, the state government announced a new highway that would supersede the Church Street/Woodville Road route as the major connection between the Pacific and Hume Highways. The existing roads of Hart Drive, Freame Street, Emert Street, Jersey Road, Betts Road, Warren Road, Smithfield Road, Palmerston Road, Cambridge Street, Joseph Street and Orange Grove Road were widened and connected to each other to form a continuous road. The first of these to be completed was between Harris Road and Freame Street railway underpass at Wentworthville.

With the completion of the section between Great Western Highway and Jersey Road, State Highway 13 was altered to use the new route and also named Cumberland Highway on 26 August 1988, from the intersection with Pacific Highway in Wahroonga via Parramatta to the intersection with Hume Highway at Liverpool. State Route 77 was allocated to the entire length of the highway, subsuming State Route 55 between Parramatta and Wahroonga; the northern end of State Route 55 was truncated to meet State Route 77 at Pennant Hills Road. Metroad 7 replaced State Route 77 in June 1993 and the highway was designated by the Federal Government as an interim National Highway in 1994 until the completion of Westlink M7; Metroad 7 originally continued south through Liverpool and along Heathcote Road to the intersection with Princes Highway (then Metroad 1, now route A1) at , but was truncated back to Liverpool in 1999.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Cumberland Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 13, from the intersection with Pacific Highway in Wahroonga via Parramatta to the intersection with Hume Highway at Liverpool.

Since 1994, various parts of Cumberland Highway have been upgraded, including the widening of Pennant Hills Road.

===Post-Westlink M7 and NorthConnex===
With the opening of the Westlink M7 motorway in December 2005, the Metroad 7 route south of M2 Hills Motorway was decommissioned and rerouted onto the Westlink M7, leaving only the section north of M2 Hills Motorway along Pennant Hills Road designated as Metroad 7; Metroad 6 was extended northwards from Carlingford along Pennant Hills Road to meet M2 Hills Motorway at the same time, leaving the rest of Cumberland Highway west of Carlingford without a route number. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, Cumberland Highway was re-designated part of route A28, replacing the last remnant of Metroads 6 and 7 along Pennant Hills Road.

NorthConnex, opened in October 2020, links the M2 Hills Motorway at with the Pacific Highway and Pacific Motorway at Wahroonga via a motorway tunnel that aims to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow along the Pennant Hills Road section of Cumberland Highway. Since its opening, all trucks and buses over 12.5 metres long or over 2.8 metres clearance height (except vehicles transporting dangerous goods, oversize vehicles, or that have a genuine destination only accessible via Pennant Hills Road) travelling between the M1 and M2 are forbidden to use Pennant Hills Road and must use the NorthConnex tunnels instead. Trucks and buses will be monitored by two gantries located along Pennant Hills Road, one at Normanhurst and one at Beecroft / West Pennant Hills. A fine of A$194 with no demerit points will also be imposed on truck and bus drivers detected (with the use of cameras mounted on gantries) using Pennant Hills Road with the traffic flow.

<text>Cyberman is a 2001 documentary film about Steve Mann, inventor of the EyeTap. It was directed by Peter Lynch, but much of the material in the film was also shot by Mann himself, through his EyeTap. Thus Cyberman may well have been the first film in which the subject incidentally or existentially (i.e. just by being himself) shot much of the material used in the film.

The book &quot;Cyborg...&quot; was released the same year, and much of the material in the film is based on material in an early draft of the book&#x27;s manuscript.

Novelist William Gibson appears in the film, in conjunction with Mann&#x27;s presentation at the TED (Technology Entertainment and Design) conference. Mann and Gibson were both presenters at TED, and the interview takes place immediately following their presentations at the conference.

<doc id="987471" wikidata="Q6942076" url="?curid=987471" title="Music of Fiji">
<text>Fiji is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. Though geographically Melanesian, the music of Fiji is more Polynesian in character. Nevertheless, Fijian folk styles are distinct in their fusion of Polynesian and Melanesian traditions. Folk music is dominated by vocal church music, as well as dances characterized by rich and dull harmony and complex percussion made from slit drums or natural materials, such as drums.
==Folk music==
Like their Polynesian neighbours, modern Fijians play guitar, ukulele and mandolin along with a variety of indigenous instruments, most commonly lali drums, which are now used to call the people of an area together. Lali drums were an important part of traditional Fijian culture, used as a form of communication to announce births, deaths and wars. A smaller form of the lali drum (&quot;lali ni meke&quot;) is used as a form in instrumentation. &quot;Meke&quot; is a kind of spiritual folk dance, in which dancers bodies are said to be possessed by spirits. Other percussion instruments include the derua, which are tubes made of bamboo which are stamped on mats or on the ground. Other dances included the women&#x27;s &quot;dele&quot; or wate, which humiliated enemy prisoners sex, and the men&#x27;s &quot;cibi&quot;, which uses spears and clubs .

==Indo-Fijian music==
Indian music draws heavily from rural North Indian and some of the Southern states in India. Most popular are Bhajans — a devotional music based accompanied by harmonium and dholak (drums). Many Indians now also export bhajan CDs for large Fiji Indian diaspora in Canada, United States, Australia and New Zealand. Jazz too, has become increasingly popular as cultural horizons have broadened.

===Qawaali===
According to Qawaali/Ghazal singer Ustad Sheikh Mohyudean (August 1, 1920 – January 1, 2015) and Indian Classical musician Cassius Khan, the Qawaali has undergone a major transformation in Fiji. Because of the lack of classically trained tabla players who came to Fiji in the late 1900s, after their demise, some qawaali musicians started playing with dholak players who only knew how to accompany the Bhajan, and therefore incorporated a new style of music, somewhat akin to early jazz. When the trend caught on, some Bhajan singers also tried their voices in qawaali, and brought Bihari elements into the music known as &quot;Phagua gayaki&quot; an ancient bhajan singing style in Bihar, India. The classical qawaali style slowly took a back seat to this new style of singing, but has been snubbed by purists because of its non connection to qawaali. The word Qawaali means &quot;utterance in the name of Allah.&quot; Qawaali in Fiji is rhythmically more challenging with a firm emphasis on percussion rather than the more traditional aspect which focuses on lyrics.

===Ghazal and Thumri===
Mushtari Begum (Dec 25th 1934–March 14, 2004) was the first Indian Ghazal/Thumri exponent from Lucknow, India who resided in Fiji. She was a disciple of her father Ustad Amjad Ali, a Thumri exponent. She later learned in India from greats such as Ustad Faiyaz Khan and Shamla Bhave of Bangalore, India. Her extraordinary vocal capabilities in her voice ranged close to 4 octaves and in her prime, quickly ruled the charts of Fiji&#x27;s music industry. In her career she won 36 trophies and numerous recognitions and awards between 1947 and 1973. She was awarded the title &quot;Malika-e-Ghazal&quot; or Queen of Ghazal by the Indian High Consulate in 1973.

Internationally renowned star tabla player and ghazal wizard Cassius Khan, born in Lautoka, Fiji has collaborated with some great world musicians and is the only known musician in the world who plays tabla and sings ghazals simultaneously. The senior disciple of the late Mushtari Begum, he is currently based in Vancouver, is recognized as one of the treasures of Canada as he has received the &quot;Salute to Excellence&quot; Award, and has many albums to his credit. Khan also made history as the first ever Indian Classical Ghazal/Tabla player who performed at the SXSW Festival in Austin Texas in 2008, and again at the Canada Music Week Festival in Toronto, Canada in 2009. One of his collaborations received a Juno Award in 2007. Khan also runs the Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance in his hometown New Westminster, BC, Canada, which debuted in 2012.

===Dholak music===
Notable Dholak player Sashi Roy is one of the leading exponents of Dholak playing who was born in Nadi, Fiji. He has incorporated a new technique of playing the &quot;dholak tarang&quot; style- playing multiple dholaks tuned in different notes in unison and is one of the most recognized soloists in this art form. He is currently residing in Edmonton, Canada.In contemporary times, Shailendra Prakash Sharma is particularly acclaimed in this artform. He has performed with a range of artists (local and from Bollywood) during concerts, and also played in a number of locally produced albums especially in fiji bhajan and fiji kirtan.

==Popular music==
In the 1980s, Fijian performers like Laisa Vulakoro and Lagani Rabukawaqa became pan-Pacific stars. Vulakoro is especially well known for her part in creating &quot;vude&quot;, a popular style that combines disco, country and island music (especially the &quot;meke&quot; rhythm), rock and roll and jazz (for which the islands are rightly famous).

Other modern performers include the bands Nuku Katudrau, Karuna Gopalan, Rosiloa (Black Rose), Danny Costello, Michelle Rounds, Seru Serevi The Freelancers.

Reggae is also a popular music genre in Fiji, as is jazz.

<doc id="987480" wikidata="Q697429" url="?curid=987480" title="China Times">
<text>The China Times (, abbr. ) is a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Taiwan and one of the most widely circulated newspapers in Taiwan. Founded in 1950, the China Times Group was acquired by food and media conglomerate Want Want, which also owns TV stations CTV and CTiTV.

The paper is generally perceived by the Taiwanese general public to be supportive of the pan-Blue coalition, which consists of the Kuomintang and allied political groups—while also facing allegations that it supports the political priorities of the Chinese Communist Party.

==History==
The &quot;China Times&quot; was founded in February 1950 under the name &quot;Credit News&quot; (), and focused mainly on price indices. The name changed on January 1, 1960, to &quot;Credit Newspaper&quot; (), a daily with comprehensive news coverage. Color printing was introduced on March 29, 1968, the first newspaper in Asia to make the move. On September 1, 1968, the name changed once again to &quot;China Times&quot;, presently based in the Wanhua District, Taipei.

By the 1970s, the &quot;China Times&quot; became one of the two largest traditional news groups in Taiwan, alongside &quot;United Daily News&quot;.

&quot;China Times&quot; once managed a Taiwan-based baseball team, the China Times Eagles, but a betting scandal dissolved the team seven years into its operation.

The founder, , died in 2002, leaving the presidency of the paper to his second son, . Yu Chi-chung&#x27;s eldest daughter, Yu Fan-ing, is the vice president. The bureau chief is Lin Shengfen (), the general manager Huang Chao-sung (), and the chief editor Huang Ch&#x27;ing-lung ().

In 2008, the China Times Group was sold to the Want Want Holdings Limited, the largest rice cake manufacturer in Taiwan.

In 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; published a report alleging that the &quot;China Times&quot; as well as Chung T&#x27;ien Television, also owned by Want Want, took daily orders from the Taiwan Affairs Office. The Want Want China Times Media Group subsequently filed defamation claims against the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and announced the intent to file defamation claims against any news organization that cited the &quot;Financial Times&quot; report. Reporters Without Borders called the lawsuit a &quot;an abusive libel suit&quot; and accused Want Want of harassing an experienced journalist. The lawsuit was dropped by Want Want on March 11, 2021.

== Editorial stance ==
The &quot;China Times&quot; was historically aligned with the liberal wing (自由派) of the Kuomintang.

Since &quot;China Times&quot; was bought by the pro-China Taiwanese businessman tycoon Tsai Eng-Meng, head of Want Want Holdings Limited, in 2008, the &quot;Times&quot; has veered into an editorial stance more sympathetic to the positions of the Chinese Communist Party. It has since been criticized of being &quot;very biased&quot; in favor of positive news about the Chinese government. In a 2020 interview with &quot;Stand News&quot;, an anonymous &quot;Times&quot; journalist described the editorial stance of the paper as having changed completely after Tsai&#x27;s acquisition. The interviewed journalist said the newspaper mandated the use of vocabulary that supports the PRC&#x27;s positions on Taiwan, and prevented its reporters from covering topics that may be seen as against the Chinese government, such as issues involving the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Tsai himself has openly admitted to airing commercials from PRC authorities.

<text>Sheets of sound was a term coined in 1958 by &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine jazz critic Ira Gitler to describe the new, unique improvisational style of John Coltrane. Gitler first used the term on the liner notes for &quot;Soultrane&quot; (1958).

==Style==
Coltrane, a saxophonist, employed extremely dense improvisational yet patterned lines consisting of high speed arpeggios and scale patterns played in rapid succession: hundreds of notes running from the lowest to highest registers. The lines are often faster than sixteenth notes, consisting of quintuplets, septuplets, etc., and can sound like glissandos. Coltrane invented this style while playing with Thelonious Monk and developed it further when he returned to Miles Davis&#x27; group.

==Vertical approach==
Coltrane used the &quot;sheets of sound&quot; lines to liquidise and loosen the strict chords, modes, and harmonies of hard bop, whilst still adhering to them (at this stage in his musical development). Playing with the Miles Davis groups, in particular, gave Coltrane the free musical space in which to apply harmonic ideas to stacked chords and substitutions. Further, this open approach allowed Coltrane to arpeggiate three chords simultaneously, a style Monk initially taught Coltrane. The &quot;three-on-one chord approach&quot; gave the music a fluid, sweeping sound that was harmonically vertical. Concepts of vertical (chordal) versus horizontal (melody) are key ideas in the work of George Russell, whom Coltrane had recorded with in September 1958. This approach reflected Coltrane&#x27;s fascination with third relations. Sometimes he used diminished chords, other times he used augmented chords. At times, Coltrane might use scales or licks in the passing keys instead of arpeggios. Coltrane employed these harmonic ideas during his &quot;sheets of sound&quot; stage in 1958. At other times, he would simply play rapid patterns of diminished-scales.

==Usage==
The &quot;sheets of sound&quot; approach can be heard as early as the 1957 collaboration with Monk in solos like the one on &quot;Trinkle, Tinkle&quot; from the album &quot;Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane&quot;. Coltrane&#x27;s live performance of &quot;If I Were a Bell&quot; with the Miles Davis sextet on September 9, 1958, well exemplifies his use of the &quot;sheets of sound&quot; during this stage of his career. In &quot;Trane on the Track&quot;, an article published on October 16, 1958 in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, Coltrane spoke to Ira Gitler about the sheets of sound, telling him, &quot;Now it is not a thing of beauty, and the only way it would be justified is if it becomes that. If I can&#x27;t work it through, I will drop it.&quot; Coltrane began using the style intermittently in 1959, preferring to incorporate it into his solos in a less abrupt manner.

<doc id="987490" wikidata="Q5182390" url="?curid=987490" title="Crash bar">
<text>A crash bar (also known as a panic exit device, panic bar, or bump bar) is a type of door opening mechanism which allows users to open a door by pushing a bar. While originally conceived as a way to prevent crowd crushing in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings.

The device consists of a spring-loaded metal bar which is fixed horizontally to a door that swings in the direction of an exit. Depressing the bar unlatches the door, allowing occupants to quickly leave the building.

Modern fire standards often mandate that doors be fitted with crash bars in commercial and other occupancies where mass evacuation may be slowed by other types of door openers.

They are sometimes intended solely for emergency use and may be fitted with alarms. However, in many buildings the crash bar is the primary mechanism for opening a door in normal circumstances as well. They may even be used when not required by code, because they are quicker and easier to use compared with a knob or lever handle.

==Background==

=== History ===
Following the events of the Victoria Hall disaster in Sunderland, England, in 1883 in which 183 children died because a door had been bolted at the bottom of a stairwell, the British government began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum number of outward opening doors as well as locks which could be opened from the inside. Motivated by the Sunderland disaster, Robert Alexander Briggs (1868–1963) invented the panic bolt which was granted a UK patent on 13 August 1892.

However, these moves were not globally copied. For example, in the United States, at least 602 people died in the Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago in December 1903 because of door latch designs that were difficult for fleeing patrons to open. Five years later, 174 people in Ohio died in the Collinwood school fire, which led to a national outcry in the United States for greater fire safety in buildings.

On 31 December 1929, some 37 years after the panic bolt was patented, 71 children died during the Glen Cinema disaster at a Hogmanay film screening in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, when a smoking cellulose nitrate film canister sparked panic. Children rushing to escape the cinema became crushed against the padlocked exit doors. Even after a police officer broke a padlock, the inward-opening doors were held shut by the mass of bodies behind them.

=== Justification for use ===

By the end of the 20th century, most countries had building codes (or regulations) which require all public buildings have a minimum number of fire and emergency exits. Crash bars are fitted to these types of doors because they are proven to save lives in the event of human crushes. Panic can often occur during mass building evacuations caused by fires or explosions.

In the event emergency exits are required, the crash bar works efficiently to allow people to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar&#x27;s fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a logjam at the exits. Such a human crush, which has many historical precedents, can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd are impeded by a door.

Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of occupants. Common locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many occupants, or doors serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the International Building Code or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants expected to exit quickly through a given door.

== Latching ==

Crash bars offer several configurations for latching to the door frame. 

Vertical rods can be affixed to crash bars allowing both doors to be opened with no center clearance obstruction. When the bar is depressed, a chord within the vertical rod gets pulled, which lowers a latch at the top and/or bottom and allows the door to open. The &quot;Pullman latch&quot;, which attaches to a Pullman keeper, is the locking mechanism usually used at the ends of the vertical rods. More expensive products may feature vertical rods and latches concealed within the door. 
Some jurisdictions permit doors to latch to each other. For security, additional latching points may be added. For example, upper and lower vertical rods added to one door and connected to the leaf with no rods via a mortice latch. A &quot;double door coordinator&quot; is used to ensure the active leaf does not close before the inactive leaf. This configuration is not recommended for high traffic locations.

Center posts are an alternative to vertical rods at double door exits. This offers less clearance because the post remains in the middle when both doors are open. That said, the post can often be removed with a key for occasions when items larger than a single door need to pass through. Center posts may be preferred over vertical rods because they have fewer moving parts, thus they have fewer components that can wear out or break. 

Push bars themselves are some of the most reliable door opening mechanisms. To pass CE certification, bars must function between 100,000 and 500,000 opening cycles depending on the rating the manufacturer is seeking.

=== Unlocking and latch hold ===
In some applications, such as storefront entrances, panic bars may be &quot;dogged&quot; during business hours. Dogging is a common feature on panic bars in which the bar is retracted with a key, thus freeing the door to operate without latching. This allows customers to apply force to any portion of the door, not just the bar, in order to open it. 

Dogging is distinct from simple unlocking, which permits the user to open the door from both sides but still requires performing an action to release the latches. However, in applications where the exterior side contains an immovable &quot;dummy handle&quot;, as opposed to a knob or lever handle, it is usually impossible to unlock the crash bar without also dogging it.

Dogging can extend the life of the panic bar mechanism. Some bars can be unlocked/dogged electronically, while others take a cylinder lock, hex key, or contain no key functionality at all. Dogging should be avoided in high wind areas where the door is susceptible to blowing open.

=== Electric strike ===

Unlike a traditional crash bar, this type contains a horizontal touch sensor and no moving parts. When the sensor is pressed, it releases an electromagnetic lock. It may be used in tandem with a motion sensor which unlocks for anyone who stands in front of the door. This type of release must still unlock in the event of a power failure, and in some jurisdictions, the door must automatically unlock for a fire alarm activation. Because these will not function in a long term power outage, they are most commonly used on secondary doors between a vestibule and the secure part of a building.

=== On automatic doors ===
In some jurisdictions, when automatic doors are used on the primary exit route, these doors are equipped with crash bars. In the event the automatic door does not function, it becomes an outward swinging rather than sliding door. Crash bars are one of many emergency release mechanisms that can be used with automatic doors. Depending on available space, a common alternative is to install an emergency exit door beside the automatic doors. Installation of a secondary crash bar equipped exit is often required in large buildings with revolving doors, since these are too slow for a crowd to move through.
==Around the world==
=== European Union ===
In the European Union, panic bars are governed by the standard &quot;EN 1125&quot;, &quot;Panic exit devices operated by a horizontal bar&quot;. As with other EN family standards, the English language version is produced by the British Standards Institution and utilises the call sign BS EN 1125. Panic bars are required to conform to this standard in order to carry CE marking and thus be sold in the European Economic Area.

In 2008, the standard was updated to include an alpha-numeric labelling scheme. In this system, products are tested to various benchmarks and assigned a letter or number accordingly. Products must achieve minimum quality scores in order to receive general CE approval. The nine rating categories are:

# Category of Use
# Number of Test Cycles
# Test Door Mass
# Fire Resistance
# Safety
# Corrosion Resistance
# Security
# Projection of device
# Type of device

EN 1125 is one of two standards which govern exit devices in the EU. The other standard, EN 179, governs door handles, push pads, and other exit devices with emergency release functionality.

However, EN 179 devices shall only be used at locations where people &quot;are familiar with the emergency exit and its hardware and therefore a panic situation is unlikely to appear&quot;. Examples of places where EN 179 hardware may be used in place of EN 1125 panic bars include small apartment buildings and offices.

===United States===
The first panic bar, made by Von Duprin, was available by 1908 in many models and configurations.

In the US, building exit requirements are generally controlled by model codes such as the International Building Code and the NFPA Life Safety Code. Adoption of regulations varies by location and may occur at the city, county, or state level.

Model codes are usually supplemented with amendments adopted locally. Additional requirements may be imposed on a site from an Authority Having Jurisdiction such as a local fire marshal. Factors considered when mandating exit devices include the number of occupants who would need to leave in an emergency, the availability of other nearby exits, and proximity to any hazards equipment or chemicals.

=== Differences between Europe and North America and emerging trends ===
In Europe, most panic bars are of the cross bar type, which are called Type A in the EN 1125 standard. This contrasts strongly with North American architectural design, which years ago switched to using predominantly touch bars (EN 1125 Type B) in new construction.

In Europe, the use of panic bars is generally confined to code required applications. In US and Canadian commercial buildings, they are frequently used even where not required by code, because bars are seen as being easier to use than knobs or lever handles. For example, when used on the rear service door of a business, a worker whose hands are being used to carry bulky items can lean against a bar to release the lock. 

While the public generally prefers automatic doors, they can be costly to install and maintain. 

Some manufacturers offer crash bars designed to resist microbial growth. This can include coating the bar with silver ions in order to create a chemical environment hostile to unwanted microbes. Antimicrobial surfaces have shown to be effective at inhibiting bacterial, mold, and mildew growth; but may not be effective at stopping viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

<doc id="987492" wikidata="Q2760809" url="?curid=987492" title="Food browning">
<text>Browning is the process of food turning brown due to the chemical reactions that take place within. The process of browning is one of the chemical reactions that take place in food chemistry and represents an interesting research topic regarding health, nutrition, and food technology. Though there are many different ways food chemically changes over time, browning in particular falls into two main categories: enzymatic versus non-enzymatic browning processes.

Browning has many important implications on the food industry relating to nutrition, technology, and economic cost. Researchers are especially interested in studying the control (inhibition) of browning and the different methods that can be employed to maximize this inhibition and ultimately prolong the shelf life of food.

== Enzymatic browning ==

Enzymatic browning is one of the most important reactions that takes place in most fruits and vegetables as well as in seafood. These processes affect the taste, color, and value of such foods. Generally, it is a chemical reaction involving polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catechol oxidase, and other enzymes that create melanins and benzoquinone from natural phenols. Enzymatic browning (also called oxidation of foods) requires exposure to oxygen. It begins with the oxidation of phenols by polyphenol oxidase into quinones, whose strong electrophilic state causes high susceptibility to a nucleophilic attack from other proteins. These quinones are then polymerized in a series of reactions, eventually resulting in the formation of brown pigments (melanosis) on the surface of the food. The rate of enzymatic browning is reflected by the amount of active polyphenol oxidases present in the food. Hence, most research into methods of preventing enzymatic browning has been directed towards inhibiting polyphenol oxidase activity. However, not all browning of food produces negative effects.

Examples of beneficial enzymatic browning: 
* Developing color and flavor in coffee, cocoa beans, and tea.
* Developing color and flavor in dried fruit such as figs and raisins.

Examples of non-beneficial enzymatic browning:
* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including apples, potatoes, bananas and avocados.
* Oxidation of polyphenols is the major cause of melanosis in crustaceans such as shrimp.

== Control of enzymatic browning ==
The control of enzymatic browning has always been a challenge for the food industry. A variety of approaches are used to prevent or slow down enzymatic browning of foods, each method aimed at targeting specific steps of the chemical reaction. The different types of enzymatic browning control can be classified into two large groups: physical and chemical. Usually, multiple methods are used. The use of sulfites (powerful anti-browning chemicals) have been reconsidered due to the potential hazards that it causes along with its activity. Much research has been conducted regarding the exact types of control mechanisms that take place when confronted with the enzymatic process. Besides prevention, control over browning also includes measures intended to recover the food color after its browning. For instance, ion exchange filtration or ultrafiltration can be used in winemaking to remove the brown color sediments in the solution.

===Physical methods===
*Heat treatment − Treating food with heat, such as blanching or roasting, de-naturates enzymes and destroys the reactants responsible for browning. Blanching is used, for example, in winemaking, tea processing, storing nuts and bacon, and preparing vegetables for freezing preservation. Meat is often partially browned under high heat before being incorporated into a larger preparation to be cooked at a lower temperature which produces less browning. 

*Cold treatment − Refrigeration and freezing are the most common ways of storing food, preventing decay. The activity of browning enzymes, i.e., rate of reaction, drops in low temperatures. Thus, refrigeration helps to keep the initial look, color, and flavour of fresh vegetables and fruits. Refrigeration is also used during distribution and retailing of fruits and vegetables.

*Oxygen elimination − Presence of oxygen is crucial for enzymatic browning, therefore eliminating oxygen from the environment helps to slow down the browning reaction. Withdrawing air or replacing it with other gases (e.g., N2 or CO2) during preservation, such as in vacuum-packaging or modified atmosphere packaging, wine or juice bottling, using impermeable films or edible coatings, dipping into salt or sugar solutions, keeps the food away from direct contact with oxygen. Impermeable films made of plastic or other materials prevent food being exposed to oxygen in the air and avoid moisture loss. There is an increasing activity in developing packaging materials impregnated with antioxidants, antimicrobial, and antifungal substances, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tocopherols, hinokitiol, lysozyme, nisin, natamycin, chitosan, and ε-polylysine. Edible coatings can be made of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, vegetable skins, plants or other natural products.

*Irradiation − Food irradiation using UV-C, gamma rays, x-rays, and electron beams is another method to extend the food shelf life. Ionizing radiation inhibits the vitality of microorganisms responsible for food spoilage and delays the maturation and sprouting of preserving vegetables and fruits.

===Chemical methods===
*Acidification − Browning enzymes, as other enzymes, are active at a specific range of pH. For example, PPO shows optimal activity at pH 5-7 and is inhibited below pH 3. Acidifying agents and acidity regulators are widely used as food additives to maintain a desired pH in food products. Acidulants, such as citric acid, ascorbic acid, and glutathione, are used as anti-browning agents. Many of these agents also show other anti-browning effects, such as chelating and antioxidant activities.

*Antioxidants − Many antioxidants are used in food industry as food additives. These compounds react with oxygen and suppress the initiation of the browning process. Also, they interfere with intermediate products of the following reactions and inhibit melanin formation. Ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, L-cysteine, 4-hexylresorcinol, erythorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, glutathione are examples of antioxidants that have been studied for their anti-browning properties.

*Chelating agents − Polyphenol oxidase requires copper as a cofactor for its functionality, thus copper-chelating agents inhibit the activity of this enzyme. Many agents possessing chelating activity have been studied and used in different fields of food industry, such as citric acid, sorbic acid, polyphosphates, hinokitiol, kojic acid, EDTA, porphyrins, polycarboxylic acids, different proteins. Some of these compounds also have other anti-browning effects, such as acidifying or antioxidant. Hinokitiol is used in coating materials for food packaging.

===Other methods===
*Natural agents − Different natural products and their extracts, such as onion, pineapple, lemon, and white wine, are known to inhibit or slow the browning of some products. Onion and its extract exhibit potent anti-browning properties by inhibiting the PPO activity. Pineapple juice have shown to possess anti-browning effect on apples and bananas. Lemon juice is used in making doughs to make the pastry products look brighter. This effect is possibly explained by the anti-browning properties of citric and ascorbic acids in the lemon juice.

*Genetic modification − Arctic apples have been genetically modified to silence the expression of PPO, thereby delaying the browning effect, and improving apple eating quality.

== Non-enzymatic browning ==

The second type of browning, non-enzymatic browning, is a process that also produces the brown pigmentation in foods but without the activity of enzymes. The two main forms of non-enzymatic browning are caramelization and the Maillard reaction. Both vary in the reaction rate as a function of water activity (in food chemistry, the standard state of water activity is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature).

Caramelization is a process involving the pyrolysis of sugar. It is used extensively in cooking for the desired nutty flavor and brown color. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.

The other non-enzymatic reaction is the Maillard reaction. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.

Melanoidins are brown, high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine through the Maillard reaction at high temperatures and low water activity. Melanoidins are commonly present in foods that have undergone some form of non-enzymatic browning, such as barley malts (Vienna and Munich), bread crust, bakery products and coffee. They are also present in the wastewater of sugar refineries, necessitating treatment in order to avoid contamination around the outflow of these refineries.

== Browning of grapes during winemaking ==
Like most fruit, grapes vary in the number of phenolic compounds they have. This characteristic is used as a parameter in judging the quality of the wine. The general process of winemaking is initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by polyphenol oxidases. Contact between the phenolic compounds in the vacuole of the grape cell and the polyphenol oxidase enzyme (located in the cytoplasm) triggers the oxidation of the grape. Thus, the initial browning of grapes occurs as a result of &quot;compartmentalization modification&quot; in the cells of the grape.

== Implications in food industry and technology ==
Enzymatic browning affects the color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, causing huge economic loss when not sold to consumers on time. It is estimated that more than 50% of produce is lost as a result of enzymatic browning. The increase in human population and consequential depletion in natural resources has prompted many biochemists and food engineers alike to find new or improved techniques to preserve food and for longer by using methods to inhibit the browning reaction. This effectively increases the shelf life of foods, solving this part of the waste problem. A better understanding of the enzymatic browning mechanisms, specifically, understanding the properties of the enzymes and substrates that are involved in the reaction may help food technologists to control certain stages in the mechanism and ultimately apply that knowledge to inhibit browning.

Apples are fruits commonly studied by researchers due to their high phenolic content, which make them highly susceptible to enzymatic browning. In accordance with other findings regarding apples and browning activity, a correlation has been found between higher phenolic quantities and increased enzymatic activity in apples. This provides a potential target and thus hope for food industries wishing to genetically modify foods to decrease polyphenol oxidase activity and thus decrease browning. An example of such accomplishments in food engineering is in the production of Arctic apples. These apples, engineered by &quot;Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc,&quot; are a result of applying gene splicing, a laboratory technique that has allowed for the reduction in polyphenol oxidase.

Another type of issue that is closely studied is the browning of seafood. Seafood, in particular shrimp, is a staple consumed by people all over the world. The browning of shrimp, which is actually referred to as melanosis, creates a great concern for food handlers and consumers. Melanosis mainly occurs during postmortem handling and refrigerated storage. Recent studies have found a plant extract that acts as an anti-melatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor serves the same function as sulfites but without the health risks.

<doc id="987495" wikidata="Q61753" url="?curid=987495" title="Friedrich Hirzebruch">
<text>Friedrich Ernst Peter Hirzebruch ForMemRS (17 October 1927 – 27 May 2012) was a German mathematician, working in the fields of topology, complex manifolds and algebraic geometry, and a leading figure in his generation. He has been described as &quot;the most important mathematician in Germany of the postwar period.&quot;

==Education==
Hirzebruch was born in Hamm, Westphalia in 1927. His father, of the same name, was a maths teacher. Hirzebruch studied at the University of Münster from 1945 to 1950, with one year at ETH Zürich.

==Career==
Hirzebruch then held a position at Erlangen, followed by the years 1952–54 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. After one year at Princeton University 1955–56, he was made a professor at the University of Bonn, where he remained, becoming director of the &quot;Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik&quot; in 1981.
More than 300 people gathered in celebration of his 80th birthday in Bonn in 2007.

The Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem (1954) for complex manifolds was a major advance and quickly became part of the mainstream developments around the classical Riemann–Roch theorem; 
it was also a precursor of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem and Grothendieck&#x27;s powerful generalisation. Hirzebruch&#x27;s book &quot;Neue topologische Methoden in der algebraischen Geometrie&quot; (1956) was a basic text for the &#x27;new methods&#x27; of sheaf theory, in complex algebraic geometry. He went on to write the foundational papers on topological K-theory with Michael Atiyah, and collaborated with Armand Borel on the theory of characteristic classes. In his later work, he provided a detailed theory of Hilbert modular surfaces, with Don Zagier. He even found connections between the Dedekind sum in number theory and differential topology, one of the many discoveries found between these different fields. His work influenced a generation of prominent mathematicians like Kunihiko Kodaira, John Milnor, Borel, Atiyah, Raoul Bott and Jean-Pierre Serre.

In March 1945, Hirzebruch became a soldier, and in April, in the last weeks of Hitler&#x27;s rule, he was taken prisoner by the British forces then invading Germany from the west. When a British soldier found that he was studying mathematics, he drove him home, released him, and told him to continue studying.

Hirzebruch is famous for organizing the Mathematische Arbeitstagung (&quot;working meetings&quot; in German) in Bonn University, beginning in 1957, and the first speakers include Atiyah, Jacques Tits, Alexander Grothendieck, Hans Grauert, Nicolaas Kuiper, and Hirzebruch himself. It allowed international cooperation in the mathematical world for the last 60 years and was a major source of developments in topology, geometry, group theory, number theory as well as mathematical physics in a few decades&#x27; time. He also established the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics at Bonn in 1980. The institute became the place for the Arbeitstagung and Hirzebruch was its director until 1995. The second Arbeitstagung began in 1993 and continues to this day.

From 1970 to 1971 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin.

According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Hirzebruch has supervised the doctoral studies of 52 mathematicians. Some of them include Egbert Brieskorn, Matthias Kreck, Don Zagier, Detlef Gromoll, Klaus Jänich, Lothar Göttsche, Dietmar Arlt, Winfried Scharlau, Walter Neumann, Wolfgang Meyer, Kang Zuo, Hans Scheerer, Erich Ossa, Klaus Lamotke, Eduardo Mendoza, Dimitrios Dais and Friedhelm Waldhausen.

Hirzebruch died at the age of 84 on 27 May 2012.

==Honours and awards==
Amongst many other honours, Hirzebruch was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1988 and a Lobachevsky Medal in 1989.

The government of Japan awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1996 and the Seki-Takakazu prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan (MSJ) in 1997.

Hirzebruch won an Einstein Medal of the Albert Einstein Society in Bern in 1999, and received the Cantor medal in 2004.

Hirzebruch was a foreign member of numerous academies and societies, including the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences. In 1980–81 he delivered the first Sackler Distinguished Lecture in Israel. He was also a member of academies of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Israel, Finland, Hungary, Netherlands, Göttingen, Austria, and Ireland as well as the Academia Europaea and the European Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Hirzebruch was the president of the German Mathematical Society in 1962 and 1990, first after the foundation of a separate Eastern German mathematical due to the German division, and then again after the collapse of the wall which led to the unification of the East and West German Mathematical societies. He was also the first President of the European Mathematical Society from 1990 to 1994. In this way, he rebuilt the mathematical life in both Germany and Europe after the war.

<text>Lisa Concetta Dal Bello (born 22 May 1959), also known as Dalbello, is a Canadian musician. She released three albums in the pop and pop/rock genre in her late teens, from 1977 through 1981 under her full name. In 1984, she re-emerged as Dalbello, with an edgier brand of alternative rock.

==Early life==
Born to Italian and British parents, Dalbello grew up in Weston, Toronto, Ontario, and then with her family moved to Vaughan, Ontario. At age 11, she began playing guitar and writing her own songs, performing at the Mariposa Folk Festival and the Fiddlers&#x27; Green club in Toronto. The first song she wrote was reportedly a protest song called &quot;Oh, Why?&quot;

Lying about her age, at 13 she joined a government-sponsored educational music program, Summer Sounds &#x27;71, which auditioned students at various southern Ontario middle and high schools, with the objective of selecting 30 singers, songwriters, musicians and performers who would receive the opportunity to spend the first month north of the city of Toronto at a summer camp. The students would collaborate creatively, forming small music groups and bands for which they rehearsed and built a full show that toured and performed at various events throughout Ontario for the second month.

==Recording career==
In her early teens Dalbello was featured on a record by St. Margaret Mary Church Singers, where she performed two covers of traditional church songs: &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

At the age of 14, Dalbello made her 1974 recording debut with a 4-song EP that was recorded for CBC Radio, Canada&#x27;s national broadcaster. The record was produced by Jack Budgell. The EP featured four songs written and composed by Dalbello: &quot;Mourning In The Morning&quot;, &quot;The Old Man&quot;, &quot;Come Sun Days&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;.

In 1975 Dalbello was featured on a Christmas compilation by CBC Radio, in which she performs the traditional Christmas carols &quot;Deck The Halls&quot; and &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot; and a medley together with Dianne Brooks and Roy Kenner. These records were not commercially available, and airplay was legally restricted to the CBC only.

Signing with MCA Records out of L.A. when she was 17, Dalbello&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1977 was produced by David Foster and featured the then-unknown Toto members Mike Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, Steve Lukather, David Paich and David Hungate. She also collaborated with Jay Graydon, who is featured on guitar. The album won a 1978 Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year. Despite her win, however, MCA dropped her from the label because the album&#x27;s production had been too expensive. During these sessions Dal Bello recorded a song for Jay Graydon called &quot;You&#x27;re My Day&quot;. Written by Graydon and Harry Garfield, the song is not featured on the album. The song was later released on a 2006 compilation album by Graydon, titled &quot;Past To Present - The 70s&quot;. Mike Porcaro played bass on her next album &quot;Pretty Girls&quot; released independently via Talisman Records. Pretty Girls received her second Juno nomination in 1979 in the category of Female Vocalist of the Year. The album was later reissued by Capitol Records. Later in 1979, Melissa Manchester covered the song &quot;Pretty Girls&quot;; released as a single, the track hit the US top 40. This marked Dal Bello&#x27;s first international success as a songwriter.

Dalbello, signed to Capitol Records, released her third album &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; in 1981. Dalbello collaborated with Bryan Adams and Tim Thorney on the album.

After &quot;Drastic Measures,&quot; she took a break from recording to re-evaluate her creative and personal priorities and to work on her poetry. Dalbello received a Juno nomination in 1980 for Female Vocalist of The Year and in 1983 was again nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year.

She told &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;I felt there was no point in making records if I hadn&#x27;t found a sense of how I fitted in musically, and how to express myself. I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how to convey my musical ideas to the people I was working with.&quot; During this time, David Bowie&#x27;s former &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; guitarist Mick Ronson saw her in a CBC Television documentary on Canadian music while working at Phase One recording studio in Toronto and convinced her to record another album.

That album, &quot;whomanfoursays&quot; (a homophone for &quot;human forces&quot;), was co-produced by Dalbello and Ronson. It was also her first album recorded as Dalbello, and marked her transformation into an edgy rock artist. The transformation worked – the album was even more successful on the Canadian pop charts than her earlier albums had been. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;Gonna Get Close to You&quot;, later covered by Queensrÿche, and &quot;Animal&quot;, which was covered by Heavens Gate. &quot;whomanfoursays&quot; garnered four Juno nominations: two for Dalbello herself as Producer of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year, one for Lenny De Rose for Recording Engineer of the Year and one for art director Heather Brown and photographer Deborah Samuels for Best Album Graphic.

In 1985, Dalbello was nominated for a seventh Juno in the category of Female Vocalist of the Year.

In 1986, Dalbello wrote and recorded the songs &quot;Black on Black&quot; and &quot;I Do What I Do&quot; for the &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; soundtrack. Although included in the film, Dalbello&#x27;s recording of &quot;I Do What I Do&quot; was not on the soundtrack album, which instead featured a recording by John Taylor of Duran Duran; her recording of &quot;Black on Black&quot; did, however, appear in both the film and the soundtrack album. Dalbello also worked with other artists including Duran Duran&#x27;s John Taylor, Heart, the band Nena, Glass Tiger and their producer Jim Vallance.

Ronson and Dalbello planned to record a second album, however, Ronson was passed over by both her record label and her manager at that time, Roger Davies, over Dalbello&#x27;s strong objections. Dalbello then submitted four self-produced song demos to her U.S. label and manager, only to have them rejected because they wanted a real producer. Accordingly, in 1986, it was reported that Rupert Hine had finished producing a new album for Dalbello. However, regardless of the status of the Hine-produced album, partly out of frustration and partly as a practical joke, Dalbello re-submitted her self-produced song demos—crediting the producer as &quot;Bill Da Salleo&quot;, which was nothing more than a simple anagram of her name. To her surprise, her label and manager excitedly called her up saying that they loved the new demos and believed &quot;Bill&quot; was the perfect producer for the project.

The Hine-produced album was subsequently scrapped, and remains unissued. However, Dalbello would contribute guest vocals to Hine&#x27;s &quot;virtual band&quot; project Thinkman, appearing on the title track of their 1986 debut album, &quot;The Formula&quot;. Dalbello continued to produce her new album under the &quot;Da Salleo&quot; pseudonym, managing to keep both her label and manager from visiting the sessions by booking the studio time late at night. She broke the &quot;news&quot; of &quot;Bill&#x27;s premature death&quot; to her Canadian A&amp;R person Deane Cameron just prior to delivering the album to the label, and shortly after Cameron called her out of concern that the label had no signed production agreement between Bill Da Salleo and themselves. When the ruse was revealed, Cameron, a maverick in Canadian music circles who was the first record label A&amp;R person to have signing autonomy from his U.S. label counterpart out of L.A., reportedly laughed out loud, proclaiming that Dalbello had &quot;truly kicked the L.A. A&amp;R offices&#x27; asses.&quot; However, with the knowledge that Bill Da Salleo was actually Dalbello, her manager began to question the strength of the album&#x27;s production and commercial viability. It was suggested that half the album be scrapped and new songs be recorded with a new producer and other songwriters. The album was delayed 18 months as a result.

EMI released the album &quot;she&quot; in 1987. The album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Tango&quot; and &quot;Black on Black&quot;, were Dalbello&#x27;s biggest hits. The success of &quot;she&quot; allowed her to tour extensively, particularly through Europe. After the album&#x27;s release, Dalbello ended her contract with Capitol Records and decided to relocate to Los Angeles in 1990.

During her time in L.A., Dalbello spent four years expanding her musical contacts and writing songs for other artists such as Branford Marsalis and Julian Lennon, and co-writing with successful songwriters Carole Bayer Sager, Franne Golde, Bruce Roberts, Holly Knight and Gerald O&#x27;Brien. In 1991 Ronson and Dalbello discussed collaborating again. However, everything was put on hold because of a downturn in Ronson&#x27;s health. Ronson died of liver failure in 1993.

In 1994 Dalbello&#x27;s former manager, Roger Davies, asked her if she wanted to record another album. Through Davies&#x27; efforts, a recording deal with EMI Electrola, which is based in Germany, was forthcoming. Dalbello moved back to Toronto to complete work on her new album. She released &quot;whore&quot; in 1996, which received favorable reviews from critics upon its release. After the album&#x27;s release she returned to Europe to tour for the rest of that year.

==Recording guest appearances==
In addition to having appeared on Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Victor&quot;, contributing the lead vocal to the song &quot;Start Today&quot;, and having recorded duets with Duran Duran&#x27;s John Taylor and Boz Scaggs (&quot;Miss Sun&quot; from his 1980 album &quot;Hits&quot;), her vocals have appeared on records for Cher, Richard Marx, Heart, Alice Cooper, Patti LaBelle, Toto, Nena (for whom she wrote an entire translation album &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot;) and Canadian artists Rough Trade, Kim Mitchell and Glass Tiger.

==Cover versions of her music==
Melissa Manchester successfully took &quot;Pretty Girls&quot; into the US and Canadian Top 40 in 1979. Heart covered &quot;Wait for an Answer&quot; and did a version of &quot;Black on Black&quot; called &quot;Black on Black II&quot;. Queensrÿche covered &quot;Gonna Get Close to You&quot;. Both Hauteville and Meliesa McDonell covered &quot;Immaculate Eyes&quot;. Julie Masse covered &quot;Devious Nature&quot;. Heavens Gate covered &quot;Animal&quot;. Her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Mad Get Even&quot; was recorded in 1983 by the Canadian heavy metal band Helix for their third album &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;, and by The Lydia Taylor Band for their EP &quot;Bitch&quot;.

== Influence ==
Because of her powerful voice and aggressive persona, as well as her career path of starting out as a conventional mainstream dance-pop singer before reinventing herself as an idiosyncratic alternative rock artist, comparisons have been drawn between Dalbello and Alanis Morissette. However, she refused to take credit for paving the way for other female rockers like Morissette. As she explained to Jane Stevenson of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, &quot;someone like Alanis has a sense of angst, a sense of unrest within herself and that&#x27;s coming from her personal experiences which are different from mine.&quot; Dalbello credited women rockers such as Chrissie Hynde (of the Pretenders), Annie Lennox (of Eurythmics) and Patti Smith as paving the way for her and others.

==Songwriter and producer for other artists==
Dalbello has not released another album since 1996 and has primarily focused on producing and writing for other artists such as Heart, Julian Lennon, Nena, and Patti LaBelle, whom she also produced. Some of the artists and writers she has co-written with are her friends Bryan Adams, Julian Lennon and Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, as well as David Foster, Carole Bayer-Sager, Holly Knight, Chaka Khan, Branford Marsalis, Damhnait Doyle and Dan Hill.

==Television commercials and documentary voice work==
Throughout her recording career, Dalbello has been a session vocalist and voiceover artist on TV and radio commercials in North America, for which she now also writes and arranges music. In 1982 she sang the theme to the ABC TV movie &quot;The Sins of Dorian Gray&quot;. Her voice work also expanded into areas of documentary work, as well as character voices for the TV anime series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, her most known roles where those of the Negamonsters and Droids used by the villains of the series. She performed the song &quot;Always&quot; for the Cheer detergent commercial &quot;Coming Home&quot; that aired in 2003, which was so popular and garnered so many inquiries, that Cheer commissioned her to do a full length version which they made available for download from their website. Also in 2003, she performed the corporate &quot;Built for Life in Canada&quot; song for Ford of Canada; the song was a downloadable MP3 from the Canadian Ford website and was available to download until early 2004. Her song &quot;Faith in You (With All Your Heart)&quot; was used to promote the launch of the Ford Focus automobile in North America; commercials featuring it played in movie theatres and on television.

From 2002 to 2008, she was the brand announcer voice for the Canadian cable news network CBC Newsworld, and her voice was heard introducing CBC News anchor Peter Mansbridge on the network&#x27;s flagship nightly news and current affairs program, &quot;The National&quot;. She also was featured on &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation Theme&quot;, the theme song for the first three seasons of the television series &quot;&quot;.

In late 2011 Dalbello recorded three 30-second songs, &quot;Every Moment&quot;, &quot;Lift You Up&quot;, and &quot;Something Good&quot;, for The Keg chain of steakhouse restaurants in Canada and the United States.

In late 2012, the Juno Awards&#x27; online series, Juno TV, interviewed Dalbello, who shared her thoughts on her early career. The interview aired in June 2013, and was also one of her first recorded appearances in over 15 years.

==Personal life==
Dalbello currently resides in Toronto, Ontario.

<text>Fire safety is the set of practices intended to reduce destruction caused by fire. Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent of an uncontrolled fire and those that are used to limit the spread and impact of a fire.

Fire safety measures include those that are planned during the construction of a building or implemented in structures that are already standing and those that are taught or provided to occupants of the building.

Threats to fire safety are commonly referred to as fire hazards. A fire hazard may include a situation that increases the likelihood of a fire or may impede escape in the event a fire occurs.

Fire safety is often a component of building safety. Those who inspect buildings for violations of the Fire Code and go into schools to educate children on fire safety topics are Fire Department members known as &quot;Fire Prevention Officers&quot;. The Chief Fire Prevention Officer or Chief of Fire Prevention will normally train newcomers to the Fire Prevention Division and may also conduct inspections or make presentations.

==Elements of a fire safety policy==

Fire safety policies apply at the construction of a building and throughout its operating life. Building codes are enacted by local, sub-national, or national governments to ensure such features as adequate fire exits, signage, and construction details such as fire stops and fire rated doors, windows, and walls. Fire safety is also an objective of electrical codes to prevent overheating of wiring or equipment, and to protect from ignition by electrical faults.

Fire codes regulate such requirements as the maximum occupancy for buildings such as theatres or restaurants, for example. Fire codes may require portable fire extinguishers within a building, or may require permanently installed fire detection and suppression equipment such as a fire sprinkler system and a fire alarm system.

Local authorities charged with fire safety may conduct regular inspections for such items as usable fire exit and proper exit signage, functional fire extinguishers of the correct type in accessible places, and proper storage and handling of flammable materials. Depending on local regulations, a fire inspection may result in a notice of required action, or closing of a building until it can be put into compliance with fire code requirements.

Owners and managers of a building may implement additional fire policies. For example, an industrial site may designate and train particular employees as a fire fighting force. Managers must ensure buildings comply with fire evacuation regulations, and that building features such as spray fireproofing remains undamaged. Fire policies may be in place to dictate training and awareness of occupants and users of the building to avoid obvious mistakes, such as the propping open of fire doors. Buildings, especially institutions such as schools, may conduct fire drills at regular intervals throughout the year.

Beyond individual buildings, other elements of fire safety policies may include technologies such as wood coatings, education and prevention, preparedness measures, wildfire detection and suppression, and ensuring geographic coverage of local and sufficient fire extinguishing capacities.

==Common fire hazards==

Some common fire hazards are:
*Kitchen fires from unattended cooking, grease fires/chip pan fires 
*Electrical systems that are overloaded, poorly maintained or defective
*Combustible storage areas with insufficient protection
*Combustibles near equipment that generates heat, flame, or sparks
*Candles and other open flames
*Smoking (Cigarettes, cigars, pipes, lighters, etc.)
*Equipment that generates heat and utilizes combustible materials
*Flammable liquids and aerosols
*Flammable solvents (and rags soaked with solvent) placed in enclosed trash cans
*Fireplace chimneys not properly or regularly cleaned
*Cooking appliances - stoves, ovens
*Heating appliances - fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, furnaces, boilers, portable heaters, solid fuels
*Household appliances - clothes dryers, curling irons, hair dryers, refrigerators, freezers, boilers
*Chimneys that concentrate creosote
*Electrical wiring in poor condition
*Leaking/defective batteries
*Personal ignition sources - matches, lighters
*Electronic and electrical equipment
*Exterior cooking equipment - barbecue

==Fire code==
In the United States, the fire code (also fire prevention code or fire safety code) is a model code adopted by the state or local jurisdiction and enforced by fire prevention officers within municipal fire departments. It is a set of rules prescribing minimum requirements to prevent fire and explosion hazards arising from storage, handling, or use of dangerous materials, or from other specific hazardous conditions. It complements the building code. The fire code is aimed primarily at preventing fires, ensuring that necessary training and equipment will be on hand, and that the original design basis of the building, including the basic plan set out by the architect, is not compromised. The fire code also addresses inspection and maintenance requirements of various fire protection equipment in order to maintain optimal active fire protection and passive fire protection measures.

A typical fire safety code includes administrative sections about the rule-making and enforcement process, and substantive sections dealing with fire suppression equipment, particular hazards such as containers and transportation for combustible materials, and specific rules for hazardous occupancies, industrial processes, and exhibitions.

Sections may establish the requirements for obtaining permits and specific precautions required to remain in compliance with a permit. For example, a fireworks exhibition may require an application to be filed by a licensed pyrotechnician, providing the information necessary for the issuing authority to determine whether safety requirements can be met. Once a permit is issued, the same authority (or another delegated authority) may inspect the site and monitor safety during the exhibition, with the power to halt operations, when unapproved practices are seen or when unforeseen hazards arise.

===List of some typical fire and explosion issues in a fire code===
*Fireworks, explosives, mortars and cannons, model rockets (licenses for manufacture, storage, transportation, sale, use)
*Certification for servicing, placement, and inspecting fire extinguishing equipment
*General storage and handling of flammable liquids, solids, gases (tanks, personnel training, markings, equipment)
*Limitations on locations and quantities of flammables (e.g., 10 liters of gasoline inside a residential dwelling)
*Specific uses and specific flammables (e.g., dry cleaning, gasoline distribution, explosive dusts, pesticides, space heaters, plastics manufacturing)
*Permits and limitations in various building occupancies (assembly hall, hospital, school, theater, elderly care, child care centers) that require a smoke detector, sprinkler system, fire extinguisher, or other specific equipment or procedures
*Removal of interior and exterior obstructions to emergency exits or firefighters and removal of hazardous materials
*Permits and limitations in special outdoor applications (tents, asphalt kettles, bonfires, etc.)
*Other hazards (flammable decorations, welding, smoking, bulk matches, tire yards)
*Electrical safety codes such as the National Electrical Code (by the National Fire Protection Association) for the U.S. and some other places in the Americas
*Fuel gas code
* Car fire

==Public fire safety education==
Most U.S. fire departments have fire safety education programs.

Fire prevention programs may include distribution of smoke detectors, visiting schools to review key topics with the students and implementing nationally recognized programs such as NFPAS &quot;Risk Watch&quot; and &quot;Learn not to burn&quot;.

Other programs or props can be purchased by fire departments or community organizations. These are usually entertaining and designed to capture children&#x27;s attention and relay important messages. Props include those that are mostly auditory, such as puppets and robots. The prop is visually stimulating but the safety message is only transmitted orally. Other props are more elaborate, access more senses and increase the learning factor. They mix audio messages and visual cues with hands-on interaction. Examples of these include mobile trailer safety houses and tabletop hazard house simulators. Some fire prevention software is also being developed to identify hazards in a home.

All programs tend to mix messages of general injury prevention, safety, fire prevention, and escape in case of fire. In most cases the fire department representative is regarded as the expert and is expected to present information in a manner that is appropriate for each age group.

===Fire educator qualifications===
The US industry standard that outlines the recommended qualifications for fire safety educators is NFPA 1035: Standard for Professional Qualifications for Public Fire and Life Safety Educator, which includes the requirements for Fire and Life Safety Educator Levels I, II, and III; Public Information Officer; and Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Specialist Levels I and II.

===Target audiences===
According to the United States Fire Administration, the very young and the elderly are considered to be &quot;at risk&quot; populations. These groups represent approximately 33% of the population.

==Global perspectives==
Fire safety has been highlighted in relation to global supply chain management. Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, a collaborative platform for sharing ethical supply chain data, and Verité, Inc., a Massachusetts-based supply chain investigatory NGO, issued a briefing in August 2013 which highlighted the significance of this issue. The briefing referred to several major factory fires, including the 2012 Dhaka garment factory fire in the Tazreen Fashion factory and other examples of fires in Bangladesh, Pakistan and elsewhere, compared the incidence of fire safety issues in a manufacturing context, and highlighted the need for buyers, suppliers and local fire safety enforcement agencies all to take action to improve fire safety within the supply chains for ready-made garments and other products. The briefing recommended that buyers seek greater visibility of fire safety and other risks across the supply chain and identify opportunities to improve standards: &quot;buyers can encourage change through more responsible and consistent practices&quot;.

==Fire safety plan==

A fire safety plan is required by all North American national, state and provincial fire codes based on building use or occupancy types. Generally, the owner of the building is responsible for the preparation of a fire safety plan. Buildings with elaborate emergency systems may require the assistance of a fire protection consultant. After the plan has been prepared, it must be submitted to the Chief Fire Official or authority having jurisdiction for approval. Once approved, the owner is responsible for implementing the fire safety plan and training all staff in their duties. It is also the owner&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that all visitors and staff are informed of what to do in case of fire. During a fire emergency, a copy of the approved fire safety plan must be available for the responding fire department&#x27;s use.

In the United Kingdom, a fire safety plan is called a fire risk assessment.

===Fire safety plan structure===
* Key contact information
* Utility services (Including shut-off valves for water, gas and electric)
* Access issues
* Dangerous stored materials
* Location of people with special needs
* Connections to sprinkler system
* Layout, drawing, and site plan of building
* Maintenance schedules for life safety systems
* Personnel training and fire drill procedure
* Create assemble point/safe zone

===Use of fire safety plans===
Fire safety plans are a useful tool for fire fighters to have because they allow them to know critical information about a building that they may have to go into. Using this, fire fighters can locate and avoid potential dangers such as hazardous material (hazmat) storage areas and flammable chemicals. In addition to this, fire safety plans can also provide specialized information that, in the case of a hospital fire, can provide information about the location of things like the nuclear medicine ward. In addition to this, fire safety plans also greatly improve the safety of fire fighters. According to FEMA, 16 percent of all fire fighter deaths in 2002 occurred due to a structural collapse or because the fire fighter got lost. Fire safety plans can outline any possible structural hazards, as well as give the fire fighter knowledge of where he is in the building.

===Fire safety plans in the fire code===
In North America alone, there are around 8 million buildings that legally require a fire safety plan, be it due to provincial or state law. Not having a fire safety plan for buildings which fit the fire code occupancy type can result in a fine, and they are required for all buildings, such as commercial, industrial, assembly, etc.

===Advances in fire safety planning===
As previously stated, a copy of the approved fire safety plan shall be available for the responding fire department. This, however, is not always the case. Up until now, all fire plans were stored in paper form in the fire department. The problem with this is that sorting and storing these plans is a challenge, and it is difficult for people to update their fire plans. As a result, only half of the required buildings have fire plans, and of those, only around 10 percent are up-to-date. This problem has been solved through the introduction of digital fire plans. These fire plans are stored in a database and can be accessed wirelessly on site by firefighters and are much simpler for building owners to update.

==Insurance companies==
Fire is one of the biggest threats to property with losses adding up to billions of dollars in damages every year. In 2019 alone, the total amount of property damage resulting from fire was $14.8 billion in the United States. Insurance companies in the United States are not only responsible for financially covering fire loss but are also responsible for managing risk associated with it. Most commercial insurance companies hire a risk control specialist whose primary job is to survey property to ensure compliance with NFPA standards, assess the current risk level of the property, and make recommendations to reduce the probability of fire loss. Careers in property risk management continue to grow and have been projected to grow 4 to 8% from 2018 to 2028 in the United States.

<text>Maurice Herbert Dobb (24 July 1900 – 17 August 1976) was an English economist at Cambridge University and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He is remembered as one of the pre-eminent Marxist economists of the 20th century. Dobb was highly influential outside of economics, having helped to establish the Communist Party Historians Group which developed social history and attracted future members of the Cambridge Five to Marxism in the 1930s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dobb was born on 24 July 1900 in London, the son of Walter Herbert Dobb and the former Elsie Annie Moir. He and his family lived in the London suburb of Willesden. He was educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, an elite British public school.

Dobb began writing after the death of his mother in his early teens. His introversion hindered him from building a network of friends. His earliest novels were fictional fantasies. Much like his father, Dobb initiated practice in Christian Science after his mother&#x27;s death; the family had previously belonged to the Presbyterian Church.

Saved from military conscription by the Armistice of November 1918, Dobb was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1919 as an exhibitioner to read economics. He gained firsts in both parts of the economics tripos in 1921 and 1922 and was admitted to the London School of Economics for graduate studies under Edwin Cannan and Hugh Dalton. 

In 1920, after Dobb&#x27;s first year at Pembroke College, John Maynard Keynes invited him to join the Political Economy Club, and after graduation Keynes helped him secure his Cambridge position. Dobb was open with students about his communist beliefs. One of them, Victor Kiernan, later reported, &quot;We had no time then to assimilate Marxist theory more than very roughly; it was only beginning to take root in England, although it had one remarkable expounder at Cambridge in Maurice Dobb.&quot; Dobb&#x27;s house, &quot;St Andrews&quot; in Chesterton Lane, was a frequent meeting place for Cambridge communists, known locally as &quot;The Red House&quot;.

===Communism===

Dobb joined the Communist Party of Great Britain while in London in 1922. In the 1930s he was central to the development of the Communist Party at the university. One recruit was Kim Philby, who later became a high-placed mole within British intelligence. It has been suggested that Dobb was a &quot;talent-spotter&quot; for Comintern. Dobb was a highly placed communist revolutionary in Britain at the time. He was politically very active and spent much time organizing rallies and presenting lectures on a consistent basis. As an economist commonly focused on vulnerability to economic crisis and pointed to the United States as a case of capitalist money assisting military agendas instead of public works.

===Academic career===
After gaining a PhD in 1924, Dobb returned to Cambridge as university lecturer. Dobb&#x27;s position at Trinity connected him to it for more than 50 years. He was elected a fellow in 1948, at which time he began joint work with Piero Sraffa assembling the selected works and letters of David Ricardo. The results were eventually published in eleven volumes. He did not receive a university readership until 1959.

Over his career he published twelve academic books, more than 24 pamphlets and numerous articles for general audiences. He often wrote on political economy, drawing a connection between the social context and problems in society and how that influences market exchange. &quot;Economic relations of men determine social associations of men,&quot; he said in his Marxian economics class. Dobb believed the capitalist system created classes and with class came class warfare. After a 1925 trip to Russia with Keynes, Dobb refrained slightly from his interests in political conflict.

Other positions held by Dobb around 1928 include teaching in a summer school, acting as Chairman of the Faculty of Economics of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and helping to launch the party&#x27;s own film company. He encountered differing opinions within the party, pushing that intellect and political activity are not mutually exclusive.

In 1931, Dobb married Barbara Marian Nixon as a second wife for the rest of his life. She never claimed to be a communist, but was active in the Labour Party and held a seat on London County Council while pursuing a career in acting. Dobb&#x27;s personal life was of particular interest to his colleagues, and due to the controversy Pembroke College dropped Dobb as a Director of Studies and withdrew his dining rights. In the same year he gave a lecture on his recent trip to Russia, which prompted some to call him a &quot;paid official of the Russian government&quot;, again causing a small scandal at Cambridge. Dobb responded with an article in &quot;The Times&quot; claiming no connection with the Soviet Union.

In the 1930s he befriended the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who stayed with Dobb and his wife for a period.

===The Hogarth Press===
The Hogarth Press, founded by Virginia and Leonard Woolf, was a printing press intent on publishing items that encouraged free exchange of ideas. Leonard Woolf himself was an anti-imperialist. He also believed intellectual exchange was the same as economical exchange in material form; Dobb&#x27;s publications were both intellectual exchange through introduction and defense of Marxism and pieces of work that could be sold. Publications possibly reflected the opinions of Leonard and Virginia Woolf. Leonard Woolf later commissioned &quot;The Political and Social Doctrine of Communism&quot;, having originally asked Maurice Dobb and another author, who both refused. Between &quot;1924 and the late 1930s, the Hogarth Press published eight pamphlets on Russia, communism, and Marxism… the motives, supported by Leonard Woolf, were political and educational.&quot;

Dobb published two pamphlets with Hogarth Press. The first, &quot;Russia To-day and Tomorrow&quot; (1930), was written after his return from Russia with Keynes. He commented on the Soviet economy, politics, industry, and culture in what became a strong seller in the 1930s. His second pamphlet, &quot;On Marxism To-Day&quot; (1932) was intended as a rudimentary introduction to communism directed to the general public.

===Death and legacy===
Maurice Dobb died on 17 August 1976. By then he had started to question his earlier devotion to Russia&#x27;s economics.

His socialist ideals, however, did not die with him. He had two notable students, Amartya Sen and Eric Hobsbawm. Sen won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 and Bharat Ratna in 1999 for his work in welfare economics, and the inaugural Charleston-EFG John Maynard Keynes Prize for his work on welfare economics; he later became Master of Trinity (1998–2004), Dobb&#x27;s own college. Hobsbawm, meanwhile, was a Marxist historian specializing in the nineteenth century but writing on other periods as well, who produced numerous works and was active in the Communist Party Historians Group and the Communist Party of Great Britain.

==Economic thought==
Dobb was an economist primarily involved in interpreting neoclassical economic theory from a Marxist point of view. His involvement in the original economic calculation problem debate consisted of critiques of capitalist, centrally planned socialist or market socialist models based on the neoclassical framework of static equilibrium.

He was also critical of the marginalist thought within neoclassical economics. Since Marx&#x27;s death, this had become popular within the field, with Dobb arguing on behalf of Marx. Marginal utility, the main foundation of marginalism, posits a way to quantify levels of satisfaction as a person consumes each additional unit of a good. The level of satisfaction also depends on the person&#x27;s behaviour. These ideas showed that the prices set for goods are more, if not completely, influenced by individual willingness to spend. The perceived value an individual gives to a good is the opposite of Marx&#x27;s labour theory of value described in &quot;Value, Price, Profit&quot;, which states that the price for a good is set by the amount of socially acceptable labour that goes into production.

In Dobb&#x27;s &quot;Theories of Value and Distribution Since Adam Smith: Ideology and Economic Theory&quot;, he argued that marginal utility and individual satisfaction cannot determine prices, as marginalism suggests. He saw a person&#x27;s preferences and level of satisfaction as heavily dependent on individual wealth, so that marginal utility is determined by spending power. This, according to Dobb, was the distribution of wealth that could alone change prices, as price depended on how much someone would spend. So he argued that individual behaviour cannot influence prices, as there are many other factors such as labour and spending power to affect them. Dobb dismissed the market-socialist model of Oskar Lange and contributions of &quot;neo-classical&quot; socialists as illegitimate &quot;narrowing of the focus of study to problems of exchange-relations.&quot;

Many of Dobb&#x27;s works have appeared in other languages. His short &quot;Introduction to Economics&quot; was translated into Spanish by the Mexican intellectual Antonio Castro Leal for the leading Mexican publisher Fondo de Cultura Economica, and has gone through more than ten editions since 1938.

For Dobb, the central economic challenges for socialism relate to production and investment in their dynamic aspects. He identified three major advantages of planned economies: antecedent co-ordination, external effects and variables in planning.

===Antecedent co-ordination===
Planned economies employ antecedent co-ordination of the economy, whereas a market economy atomises its agents by definition and the expectations that form the basis of their decisions are always based on uncertainty. There is a poverty of information that often leads to disequilibrium and can only be corrected in a market &quot;ex post&quot; (after the event), so that resources are wasted.

An advantage of antecedent planning is removal of marked degrees of uncertainty in a context of coordinated and unified information-gathering and decision-making &quot;prior to the commitment of resources&quot;.

===External effects===
Dobb was an early theorist to recognise the relevance of external effects to market exchanges. In a market economy, each economic agent in an exchange makes decisions based on a narrow range of information in ignorance of wider social effects of production and consumption.

When external effects are significant, this invalidates the information transmitting qualities of market prices, so that prices do not reflect true social-opportunity costs. Dobbs claimed that contrary to the convenient assumptions of mainstream economists, significant external effects are in fact pervasive in modern market economies. Planning that coordinates interrelated decisions before their implementation can take into account a wider range of social effects. This has important applications for efficient industrial planning, including decisions about the external effects of uneven development between sectors, and in terms of the external effects of public works, and for development of infant industries; this is in addition to widely publicised negative external effects on the environment.

===Variables in planning===
By taking the complex of factors into consideration, only coordinated antecedent planning allows for fluid allocation where things that appear as &quot;data&quot; in static frameworks can be used as variables in a planning process. By way of example one can enumerate the following categories of &quot;data&quot; that under coordinated antecedent plan will assume the form of variables that can be adjusted in the plan according to circumstances: rate of investment, distribution of investment between capital and consumption, choices of production techniques, geographical distribution of investment and relative rates of growth of transport, fuel and power, and of agriculture in relation to industry, the rate of introduction of new products, and their character, and the degree of standardisation or variety in production that the economy at its stage of development feels it can afford.

<text>Adolph Baller (July 30, 1909 – January 23, 1994) was an Austrian-American pianist who played classical and romantic music. He performed with Yehudi Menuhin for several years, toured internationally for decades with the Alma Trio, and was a renowned piano teacher at Stanford and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.

==Early years==
Baller was born July 30, 1909, in Brody, which at the time was in the Austro-Hungarian empire and is now in western Ukraine. At age 8, he went to Vienna to study piano with a former student of Franz Liszt. When he was 13 he gave his first solo performance, with the Vienna Philharmonic, following it with performances in all major European capitals.

In March 1938, Nazi soldiers learned that he was a pianist and a Jew. They arrested him, beat him and crushed his hands. Baller&#x27;s fiancée, Edith Strauss-Neustadt, interceded on his behalf with the Polish Consul in Vienna and helped to restore his hands through a long treatment so that he could resume his career. The couple escaped to Budapest, where they were married before coming to the United States in 1938.

==Career==
While Baller worked as a pianist for the WQXR radio station in New York City, he met violinist Yehudi Menuhin and cellist Gabor Rejto. Beginning in 1941, the Ballers lived with their daughter, Nina, at Menuhin&#x27;s Alma Estate in Los Gatos, California.

For several years Baller accompanied Menuhin in performances throughout the world and performed in chamber concerts, being particularly active during World War II with performances for troops deployed overseas.

Under Yehudi Menuhin&#x27;s patronage, Baller, Gabor Rejto and Roman Totenberg formed the Alma Trio in 1942–1943 at Menuhin&#x27;s Alma estate in Los Gatos, California. Violinist Maurice Wilk joined the Alma Trio after Totenberg retired. Following Wilk&#x27;s sudden death in 1963, violinist Andor Toth joined the Alma Trio and remained their violinist for the next 15 years, before the trio wound down their touring in the mid-1980s.

== Later years ==
Baller served as a faculty member at Stanford University for over 30 years. Among his most notable students were pianists Jerome Rose, William Corbett Jones, Xenia Boodberg Lee and Nohema Fernández.

In 1984, the Music Guild at Stanford created an endowment fund in his honor, providing scholarship assistance to piano students at Stanford.

He died at his home in Palo Alto on January 23, 1994, aged 84.

<text>Philip Ross Lightfoot (11 August 1936 – 11 January 2024) was an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Australian Senate from 1997 to 2008, representing the state of Western Australia.

==Early life==
Lightfoot was born in Port Lincoln, South Australia and was educated at first the Adelaide, and then Kalgoorlie School of Mines. In the 1950s, he spent time as a weekend soldier, as a result of national service. Lightfoot joined the Liberal Party of Australia soon afterwards. He worked as a mounted policeman between 1959 and 1962. In 1972, Lightfoot became a pastoralist and grazier, a line of employment he subsequently occupied for twenty years.

==Politics==
===Western Australian parliament===
His political career began in 1986, when Lightfoot won the seat of Murchison-Eyre in Western Australia&#x27;s Legislative Assembly. It was here that he first caused controversy, when he wrote to United States Secretary of State George Shultz, urging the US Government to dump subsidised wheat in Australia&#x27;s international wheat markets in Russia and China. He later retracted the statement.

Lightfoot retired from the Legislative Assembly in 1989, but made a comeback in 1993, representing the North Metropolitan Region in the Legislative Council. While in state parliament, he also advocated for the secession of Western Australia from the rest of the country.

===Federal parliament===
In 1997, Western Australian Senator John Panizza died, and Lightfoot, having been selected to fill the vacancy, moved to federal politics. He soon became a controversial figure within the party, and was rebuked by Prime Minister John Howard for telling the Senate that Aborigines in their native state were the lowest colour on the civilisation spectrum.

Lightfoot was one of a small group of Liberal MPs willing to make a preference deal with controversial MP Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party. However, this was to assist him in gaining re-election in 2001. His comments led to numerous moves to oust him from membership of his own party, but he hung on, as he was seen to represent a movement of rural conservatives in Western Australia.

Lightfoot was an active campaigner for the rights of white Zimbabwean farmers displaced by the regime of Robert Mugabe. In 2002, he made the suggestion that some could be given residency in Australia, but denied that this should apply to black farm workers as well. This was due to Robert Mugabe&#x27;s &quot;Africa for Africans&quot; policies and not allowing for the travelling rights of many oppressed peoples at that time.

In 2003, Lightfoot was involved in an altercation on the floor of the House of Representatives during a visit by President of the United States George W. Bush. Australian Greens senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle were attempting to hand Bush a letter from the wife of Mamdouh Habib, an Australian citizen who at the time was being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following his apprehension by United States forces in either (this is disputed) Afghanistan or Pakistan. Lightfoot physically blocked the path of the senators, elbowing Brown and reportedly telling Nettle to &quot;Fuck off and die&quot;.

On 17 March 2005, News Limited newspapers reported that Lightfoot, while on a parliamentary tour to Iraq, smuggled US$20,000 into the country on behalf of Woodside Petroleum as a donation for the Kurdish government, having been issued with a pistol for personal security. The newspapers published photographs of Lightfoot appearing with Kurdish militants wielding an AK-47. Lightfoot strenuously denied the allegations and threatened legal action against the newspapers carrying the story. Lightfoot denied handling the money personally, saying he merely witnessed the money changing hands. After speaking to Howard, Lightfoot issued a statement in which he said he felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; having the gun with him and did not carry it personally. The newspapers in turn refused to retract the reports and accused Lightfoot of contradicting himself.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot; reports Lightfoot as being a life fellow of the International Biographical Association, a vanity press publication.

In April 2007, facing near-certain defeat in a preselection challenge by Liberal Party vice-president Mathias Cormann, he announced he would retire at the end of his term in the Senate. Cormann was subsequently preselected to replace Lightfoot, but then selected unanimously by the WA Liberal Party State Council to replace Ian Campbell in the Senate, after Campbell announced his surprise resignation in May 2007. Michaelia Cash instead became Lightfoot&#x27;s preselected replacement. Lightfoot retired from politics in 2008.

Lightfoot stated that he considered Cormann (although he stopped short of naming him) an &quot;inappropriate person&quot; to replace him. Lightfoot&#x27;s main complaint was that there were &quot;more appropriate people&quot; to succeed him &quot;who have served the party longer&quot; and &quot;who have been in the country longer&quot;.

==Death==
Lightfoot died on 11 January 2024, at the age of 87.

<text>Men&#x27;s coxless pair competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

This rowing event was a sweep event, meaning that each rower has one oar and rows on only one side. Two rowers crewed each boat, with no coxswain. The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals.

Germany held a small lead followed by Canada, South Africa and Serbia and Montenegro. Canada suddenly veered off course, interfering with South Africa and allowing Serbia to pass it. South Africa protested, and Canada was excluded from the results. Canada requested that they would be allowed into the final as the seventh boat. The decision not to allow this came after the B Final had raced.

<text>The men&#x27;s eight competition was one of six events for male competitors in Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. It was held from 15 to 22 August. There were 9 boats (81 competitors) from 9 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the United States, the nation&#x27;s first victory in the men&#x27;s eight since 1964 and 12th overall. The Netherlands took silver. Australia, the reigning silver medalist, finished with bronze this time.

==Background==

This was the 24th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men&#x27;s eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.

The field was competitive. Canada was favoured, with wins at the 2002 and 2003 World Championships as well as Grand Challenge Cup victories in those years. But there were numerous strong contenders, including the United States (2003 Pan American champions, 2003 World runners-up), Romania (2001 World champions), Great Britain (defending Olympic champions), and the Netherlands (2004 Grand Challenge Cup winners).

No nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 21st appearance, most among nations to that point.

==Competition format==

The &quot;eight&quot; event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.

The competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals) as well as a repechage. 

* Semifinals: Two heats of four or five boats each. The top boat in each heat (2 boats total) advanced directly to the &quot;A&quot; final, while all other boats (7 total) went to the repechage.
* Repechage: Two heats of three or four boats each. The top two boats in each heat (4 boats total) rejoined the semifinal winners in the &quot;A&quot; final, with the 3rd and 4th place boats in each heat (3 boats total) eliminated from medal contention and competing in the &quot;B&quot; final.
* Finals: The &quot;A&quot; final consisted of the top six boats, awarding medals and 4th through 6th place. The &quot;B&quot; final featured the next three boats, ranking them 7th through 9th.

==Results==

===Semifinals===

====Semifinal 1====

====Semifinal 2====
The second heat of the men&#x27;s eight was a particularly intense match as the United States pulled ahead of Canada (undefeated since 2001) in the last 500 metres. The Canadian eight was a favourite for the gold, whereas the American eight had never before been tried internationally. Both boats beat the world&#x27;s best time for the men&#x27;s eight, and the United States advanced directly to the finals while Canada went to the repechage.

===Repechage===

====Final A====

The United States established an early lead. By the 1000 meter mark (halfway), they had a three-second advantage (one length) over Australia, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands who were all battling for second place. In the final 1000 meters, the Netherlands made a run at the United States, finishing 1.3 seconds short. Australia maintained its position three seconds behind the United States while Germany and Canada fell off the pace and France trailed in sixth place. The fifth-place finish was a major disappointment for Canada, the two-time defending World Champions.
