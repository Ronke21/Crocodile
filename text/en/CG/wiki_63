<text>Dantian is a concept in traditional Chinese medicine loosely translated as &quot;elixir field&quot;, &quot;sea of &quot;qi&quot;&quot;, or simply &quot;energy center&quot;. Dantian are the &quot;&quot;qi&quot; focus flow centers&quot;, important focal points for meditative and exercise techniques such as qigong, martial arts such as tai chi, and in traditional Chinese medicine. Dantian is also now commonly understood to refer to the diaphragm in various Qigong practices and breath control techniques, such as diaphragmatic breathing for singing and speaking.

==Overview==
Historically the first detailed description of the lower Dantian is in the &quot;Laozi zhongjing&quot; from the 3rd century CE, which refers to the elixir-of-life field where &quot;essence&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; are stored; it is related to regeneration and sexual energy, menstruation and semen. Traditionally, a dantian is considered to be a center of qi or life force energy. The dantian are important points of reference in neidan, qigong, neigong, daoyin, Taoist sexual practices, reiki and other self-cultivation practices of exercise, breathing, and meditation, as well as in martial arts and in Traditional Chinese medicine. The lower dantian is particularly important as the focal point of breathing technique as well as the centre of balance and gravity. Dantian are focal points for transmutation of the three treasures &quot;jing&quot;, &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;shen&quot;. &quot;Qi&quot; can be seen as a substance when it is stored in the form of &quot;jing&quot;, this can be refined by heating in these cauldrons into more rarefied states such as &quot;qi&quot; which is insubstantial and further still into &quot;shen&quot; which is more like the Western concept of mind although it is more often translated as &quot;spirit&quot;.

Taoist and Buddhist teachers often instruct their students to centre the mind in the navel or lower dantian. This is believed to aid control of thoughts and emotions. Acting from the dantian is considered to be related to higher states of awareness including sanmei (三昧) or ding (定).

==Three dantians==
Different schools of thought categorize dantian in various manners. Three main dantian are typically emphasized:
* Lower dantian (, Xià Dāntián): at the crossing of the horizontal line behind the Ren-6 acupoint and vertical line above the perineum, which is also called &quot;the golden stove&quot; (金炉 pinyin: Jīn lú) or the namesake &quot;elixir-of-life field&quot; proper, where the process of developing the elixir by refining and purifying essence (jing) into vitality (qi) begins.
* Middle dantian (, Zhōng Dāntián): at the level of the heart, which is also called &quot;the crimson palace&quot;, associated with storing spirit (shen) and with respiration and health of the internal organs, in particular the thymus gland. This cauldron is where vitality or qi is refined into shen or spirit.
* Upper dantian (, Shàng Dāntián): at the forehead between the eyebrows or third eye, which is also called &quot;the muddy pellet&quot;, associated with the pineal gland. This cauldron is where shen or spirit is transmuted into wu wei or emptiness.

==Importance of the lower dantian==
The term dantian used by itself usually refers to the lower dantian, which is considered to be the foundation of rooted standing, grounding, breathing, and body awareness in Chinese and other martial arts including qigong. The lower dantian has been described to be &quot;like the root of the tree of life.&quot;

In speaking of the lower of the three energy centers, the term dantian is often used interchangeably with the Japanese word &quot;hara&quot; (; Chinese: &quot;fù&quot;) which means simply &quot;belly.&quot; In Chinese, Korean, and Japanese traditions, it is considered the physical center of gravity of the human body and is the seat of one&#x27;s internal energy (qi). A master of Japanese acupuncture, calligraphy, swordsmanship, tea ceremony, martial arts, among other arts, is held in the Japanese tradition to be &quot;acting from the hara.&quot;

The lower dantian in traditional Chinese Medicine is where the primordial essence, Jing (精), is stored. Jing is the basis for our physical existence and can be seen as DNA. At the same time, the lower Dan Tian is the place for Yuan qi (元氣) the Qi that has not yet been divided into Yin Qi or Yang Qi. This Qi is much less physical and could be seen as the elemental existence of atoms and electrons before there are molecules. In the Ancient Texts of the Book of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi Neijing ), the lower Dan Tian is referred to as both the seat of Jing (精) and the source of Yuan qi (元氣). Both can also be used side by side as an apparent contradiction.

In this way, the lower dantian becomes the basis of all life, of your body (Jing 精) of your mind (shen,神) of the energy of life (qi, 氣 ) of your self-preservation, of your self-healing capacity, of your emotions with the basic fear / fear of life as a foundation .

In qigong practice, the lower dantian, as the source of qi, is also used for storing qi, for transforming qi, for emitting qi, for returning qi, for releasing blockages of qi in the periphery.

The area is associated to the tantric swadhisthana chakra In yoga philosophy, it is thought to be the seat of prana (compare with yuan qi) that radiates outwards to the entire body. This Chakra can be blocked by the fear of death, the bases for all emotions. Also this has the same similarity with the lower dantian

<text>Bernardino Caballero de Añazco Melgarejo y Genes (20 May 1839, Ybycuí, Paraguay – 26 February 1912, Asunción) was a Paraguayan military officer and politician, serving as a General during the Paraguayan War and later as President of Paraguay between September 1880 and November 1886. He was the founder of the Colorado Party in September 1887, the largest political party in Paraguay currently, along with the Liberal Party in second position.

==Early life==
Born in Ybycuí, Caballero was a descendant of Spanish nobility, the son of Jose Ramón Caballero de Anazco (a descendant from Túpac Huallpa through Inca Garcilaso de la Vega) and his wife Melchora Inés Melgarejo y Genés. Married twice, to María de la Concepción Díaz de Bedoya and to Julia Álvarez. From the first marriage he had two children, Ramon Caballero de Bedoya, married to Martha Cahen, and had issue, and Melchora Caballero de Bedoya, married to her distant cousin Carlos Francisco Saguier Pereira. Outside of his marriages he had a further 90 children, all formally recognized by him, and thus today he has myriad descendants.

===Military service===
Caballero joined the Paraguayan Army in 1864 and fought in the Paraguayan War. He participated in the Mato Grosso Campaign. Later he became the assistant of President Francisco Solano López in Humaitá and remaining loyal, rose through the ranks. He became an increasingly important leader of rearguard actions, eventually becoming a cavalry general. Caballero was the greatest living war hero, who was captured by Brazilians on 8 April 1870 near the Apa River after the Battle of Cerro Corá and released in May 1871. During his arrest he became friendly with Brazilians and their political and military support was instrumental later, during his political career.

==Post-war politics==
Caballero returned to Asunción and became involved in politics, joining the López loyalist faction led by Cándido Bareiro. He was one of the leaders of March and June 1873 revolts and January 1874 revolt against the politically powerful Benigno Ferreira who was forced to go into exile in February 1874. Because of his growing influence, Caballero was made Interior minister in the government of Salvador Jovellanos. In November 1874 Caballero was appointed Minister of Justice, Worship and Education under the new President Juan Bautista Gill. Together with Vice President Higinio Uriarte he was sent to London in 1874–75 to clarify the situation with financial loans.

After the death of Juan Bautista Gill in 1877, he helped to ensure that his political ally Cándido Bareiro was elected to the Presidency.

==The coup of 1880==
On 4 September 1880, after the death of Cándido Bareiro his Vice President Adolfo Saguier was arrested by the Minister of War and Navy Pedro Duarte. Adolfo Saguier was then asked to sign his resignation. On the same day Senate of Paraguay met and elected Caballero to the Presidency. Thus, after the short presidencies of politically stronger Gill and Bareiro, the leader of 1873–74 rebellions had come to power.

===Presidency===
During his rule Civil Register was established, the city of Villa Florida was founded and the General Department of Immigration created. In June 1881 Banco Nacional and private Bance del Paraguay were established. During his presidency much of the land previously owned by the state and the ruling López family was sold off in order to raise money.


==Later political life==
Caballero rigged the 1886 Presidential election to ensure the victory of his close ally Patricio Escobar. In response, his political opponents founded the Liberal Party and two months later Caballero founded the ruling Colorado Party. From 1887 to 1904 as a former president he was also member of the Senate of Paraguay, and its president in 1894 and 1902.

Caballero maintained a large degree of control as he remained commander of the army and Colorado Party. His favored candidates controlled the country until 1894, when Juan Bautista Eguzquiza overthrew Juan Gualberto González. Caballero helped to organize another coup in 1902, putting Juan Antonio Escurra in power, but after Escurra&#x27;s overthrow in the 1904 Revolution, the Liberals took power.

Caballero is buried in the National Pantheon of the Heroes, due to his wartime efforts and political significance. The Paraguayan town of General Bernardino Caballero is named after him.

<doc id="993837" wikidata="Q2257319" url="?curid=993837" title="Weapon-class destroyer">
<text>The Weapon class was a class of destroyers built for the British Royal Navy towards the end of World War II. They were the smaller counterpart to the (which followed them) and were the first new destroyer designs for the Royal Navy since the Second World War &quot;Emergency Programme&quot;. 20 ships were planned, of which only 13 were laid down and 7 were launched, but the cessation of hostilities resulted in only 4 being completed for service. Two of the ships had been previously ordered (as &quot;Celt&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot;) as part of the planned , or 15th Emergency flotilla, of 1944, but the orders were changed to the new design.

==Design==
The Weapon class were an intermediate size built to take advantage of slipways that were too small to be used to build Battle-class destroyers.

The hull length was not much increased over the &quot;War Emergency Programme&quot; design, but beam and draught were increased to allow for a displacement increase, as the latter design was grossly overweight with the addition of wartime technology to a relatively small hull. Two full sets of torpedo tubes were carried, a somewhat retrospective feature in a late-war design.

A criticism of the older designs was the use of adjacent boiler rooms. This had been adopted to allow for a single funnel, to lower the silhouette and increase the deck space of the relatively small hull. However, this made the ship vulnerable to being disabled by a single hit amidships. To remedy this, the Weapon class adopted the &quot;unit&quot; system, of side-by-side boiler and engine rooms with alternate port/starboard arrangement. This was standard practice in United States Navy ships, but these were generally far larger than their Royal Navy counterparts. The unit arrangement meant that 2 funnels were needed. The forward funnel was trunked up through the foremast and there was a small stump funnel between the torpedo tubes. This led to an unusual and rather unbalanced appearance, similar to that of the , and the Weapons were not the most attractive of ships.

The main improvement over earlier ships was to remedy the woefully inadequate arrangements for anti-aircraft defence. To this end, three twin 4-inch Mark XIV mountings were carried, remotely controlled by a Type 275 Radar equipped Mark VI(M) director, allowing full blind-fire against aircraft targets. The light battery consisted of 2 of the new STAAG (Stabilised Tachymetric Anti-Aircraft Gun) mounts for twin Bofors 40 mm guns and two single weapons on Mk. II mounts in the bridge wings. The STAAGs were carried on either side aft, and each had its own Type 262 Radar and predictive fire control computer, allowing for automatic blind-fire engagement of targets. The STAAGs were excellent weapons on paper and the firing range, but when exposed to the vibration of a naval gun mounting and the rigour of the elements they were less than reliable. Coupled with a mounting weight of 17 tons, they were something of a disappointment and their post-war service was limited. Type 293 Radar was carried on the lattice foremast for target indication.

To increase the anti-submarine capability of the class, it was decided to reduce the number of 4-inch mounts to 2, and to instead carry 2 &quot;Squid&quot; anti-submarine mortars. In &quot;Battleaxe&quot; and &quot;Broadsword&quot;, these replaced &#x27;B&#x27; gun, in the others it was &#x27;X&#x27; that was lost. The latter arrangement was in fact preferable for the location of the &quot;squid&quot;, but less so for gunnery, as it meant that the main weapons were unable to fire aft, which was a criticism also levelled at the Battle class.

All four ships were plagued by their machinery, as the steam turbines had numerous design flaws. The problems were remedied by removing the steam feed to the lower half of the reversing turbine, but this halved reversing power, and as a consequence these ships were slow to decelerate and handled rather sluggishly. This problem proved fatal for &quot;Battleaxe&quot;, when she was unable to manoeuvre quickly enough to prevent herself being rammed by the frigate in the Clyde in 1962. The damage was so catastrophic that it was beyond economical repair and she was written off as a total loss and scrapped.

The Weapons were never an entirely satisfactory design, and were criticised for their light gun armament and overly heavy torpedo outfit. Perhaps best thought of as fast fleet frigates, they undoubtedly possessed a quantum increase in fighting efficiency over the wartime emergency ships, and were more than capable of facing the increased threat of the enemy submarine and aircraft. It is possible that the mysterious G or &quot;Gael&quot; class design, which possessed 2 twin semi-automatic Mark. VI guns was an attempt to remedy some of the deficiencies of the Weapons.

==Orders and construction==

The two ships authorised under the 1942 Programme as the &quot;Centaur&quot; and &quot;Celt&quot; of the &quot;CE&quot; class were ordered from Whites of Cowes on 3 February 1942; they were renamed &quot;Tomahawk&quot; and &quot;Sword&quot; when the order was altered to the new &quot;Intermediate&quot; design.

The 1943 Programme authorised 17 ships to this design. The first six were ordered on 2 April 1943 - &quot;Battleaxe&quot; and &quot;Broadsword&quot; (from Yarrow); &quot;Carronade&quot; and &quot;Claymore&quot; (from Scotts); and &quot;Crossbow&quot; and &quot;Culverin&quot; (from Thornycroft). The next seven were ordered on 24 April - &quot;Cutlass&quot; and &quot;Dagger&quot; (from Yarrow); &quot;Dirk&quot;, &quot;Grenade&quot; and &quot;Halberd&quot; (from Scotts); &quot;Howitzer&quot; (from Thornycroft); and &quot;Musket&quot; (from White). A final four were ordered on 27 May - &quot;Longbow&quot; (from Thornycroft); &quot;Poniard&quot; (from Scotts); and &quot;Rifle&quot; and &quot;Spear&quot; (from Denny).

Three ships were cancelled on 22 November 1944 - &quot;Grenade&quot;, &quot;Halberd&quot; and &quot;Poniard&quot;. Eight more were cancelled on 15 October 1945 - &quot;Sword&quot;, &quot;Claymore&quot;, &quot;Dagger&quot;, &quot;Dirk&quot;, &quot;Howitzer&quot;, &quot;Longbow&quot;, &quot;Musket&quot; and &quot;Spear&quot;. Another four were cancelled on 23 December 1945 - &quot;Carronade&quot;, &quot;Culverin&quot;, &quot;Cutlass&quot; and &quot;Rifle&quot;.

==Modification==
The class were something of an oddity in the post-war Royal Navy, and did not figure in any of the plans for the fleet of the future. They were laid up by 1956, but there emerged a need for fast fleet Aircraft Direction (A/D) ships to accompany the carrier strike force and act as radar pickets, directing fighter cover. The Battle class were being modified for this role, but as a stop-gap, the Weapons were given a more limited conversion. This involved adding a large mainmast amidships for the Radar Type 965 with an AKE-1 &quot;single bedstead&quot; antenna array, with the torpedo tubes replaced by radar offices. The director was replaced with a lighter MRS-8 pattern, possibly to lower topweight associated with the new radar, and all ships had the squids mounted aft and the guns mounted forward. They lacked specialised height finding and aircraft direction radar sets that the Battles possessed, and so were rapidly superseded and returned to reserve.

==Ships==

* Admiral of the Fleet Viscount Cunningham remarked about his sadness at the loss of a ship named &quot;Scorpion&quot;—his first command had been —following the transfer of S-class destroyer to the Royal Netherlands Navy. A medieval form of ballista bore this name, making it suitable for the Weapon class, so the Admiralty ship names committee renamed HMS &quot;Tomahawk&quot; as &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

<text>New Belgrade (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. It was a planned city and now is the central business district of Serbia and South East Europe. Construction began in 1948 in a previously uninhabited area on the left bank of the Sava river, opposite old Belgrade. In recent years, it has become the central business district of Belgrade and its fastest developing area, with many businesses moving to the new part of the city, due to more modern infrastructure and larger available space. With 209,763 inhabitants, it is the second most populous municipality of Serbia after Novi Sad.

==Geography==

New Belgrade is located on the left bank of the Sava River, in the easternmost part of the Srem region. Administratively, its northeastern section touches the right bank of the Danube, right before its confluence with the Sava. New Belgrade is located generally west of &#x27;Old&#x27; Belgrade, to which it is connected by six bridges (Ada Bridge, New Railway Bridge, Old Railway Bridge, Gazela, Old Sava Bridge and Branko&#x27;s Bridge). European route E75, with five grade separations, including a new double-looped one at the Belgrade Arena, goes right through the middle of the settlement.

The municipality of New Belgrade covers an area of . Its terrain is flat, which poses a high contrast to the old Belgrade, built on 32 hills total. Except for its western section, Bežanija, New Belgrade is built on what was essentially a swamp when construction of the new city began in 1948. For years, kilometers-long conveyor belts transported sand to the new settlement from the Danube island of Malo Ratno Ostrvo, almost completely destroying the island in the process, leaving only a small, narrow strip of wooded land. Thus, it is romantically said that New Belgrade is actually built on an island.

Other geographic features of New Belgrade are the peninsula of Mala Ciganlija and the island of Ada Međica, both on the Sava, and the bay of &quot;Zimovnik&quot; (&quot;winter shelter&quot;), engulfed by Mala Ciganlija, with the facilities of the &quot;Beograd&quot; shipyard. The loess slope of Bežanijska Kosa is located in the western part of the municipality, while in the southern, the &quot;Galovica&quot; river canal flows into the Sava.

Though it originally had no forests in the real sense, Novi Beograd now has more green areas than all the other municipalities of Belgrade, with a total of , or 8.5% of the territory. In time, several areas of the municipality developed into fully fledged forests, and three were officially classified as such: the forest along the motorway (), the forest along the Sava Quay () and the forest on Ada Međica (). Most of the municipality&#x27;s green areas, however, are within the large Ušće park. The latest addition to the Belgrade park system (in 2008), Park Republika Srpska, is also located in the municipality.

There are no separate settlements within the municipality, as the entire area administratively belongs to Belgrade City proper and is statistically classified as part of Belgrade (&quot;Beograd-deo&quot;). The area located around the municipal assembly building and the nearby roundabout is considered to be New Belgrade&#x27;s center.

As it was planned and constructed, New Belgrade was divided into blocks. Currently, there are 72 blocks (with several sub-blocks, like 70-a, etc.). The old core of the village of Bežanija, Ada Međica, Mala Ciganlija, as well as the area along the highway west of Bežanijska Kosa, are not divided into blocks. Due to changes in administrative borders, some of the blocks (9, 9-a, 9-b, 11, 11-c and 50) belong to the municipality of Zemun, extending north of New Belgrade as one continuous built-up area.

In September 2018, Belgrade&#x27;s mayor Zoran Radojičić announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, would start soon. The dam is designed to protect the city during high water levels. Such a project had not been mentioned before, nor was it clear how or where it would be constructed, or if it were feasible at all. Radojičić clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile flood wall. The wall will be high and long, stretching from Branko&#x27;s Bridge across the Sava and the neighborhood of Ušće, to the &quot;Radecki&quot; restaurant on the Danube bank in Zemun&#x27;s Gardoš neighborhood. In case of emergency, panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.

==History==
===Early history===


Bežanija is the oldest part of today&#x27;s New Belgrade. A settlement existed here from the neolithic to the Roman period.

In the book &quot;Kruševski pomenik&quot; from 1713, which is kept in the Dobrun monastery near Višegrad, the settlement of Bežanija was mentioned for the first time under its present name in 1512, as a small village with 32 houses, populated by Serbs. In this time, the village was under the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and was part of Syrmia County. The inhabitants of the village crossed the Sava river and settled in Syrmia after fleeing the fall of the medieval Serbian Despotate at the hands of the Ottoman Empire (hence the name &quot;bežanija&quot;, &quot;refugee camp&quot; in archaic Serbian).

In 1521, the village became part of the Ottoman Empire. From 1527 to 1530, Bežanija was part of Radoslav Čelnik&#x27;s Duchy of Syrmia, an Ottoman vassal, until its subsequent organization into the Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia. The Habsburg monarchy conquered it temporarily during the Great Turkish War (1689–1691), but it remained under Ottoman administration until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the Habsburg monarchy and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Petrovaradin regiment of Slavonian Krajina). During the 17th and 18th century, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly repopulated by refugees from central Serbia.

During the 1717–1739 Austrian occupation of northern Serbia, when both banks of the Sava were Austrian, a massive process of construction works in Belgrade began. The goal was to transform Belgrade into a Baroque city, rather than an oriental one. The task of designing the new city was given to Nicolas Doxat de Démoret. In his plans, Doxat envisioned the proper, star-shaped fortification on the location of modern New Belgrade, across the Belgrade Fortress. Despite the maps printed with the existing fortification, the ramparts in the swamp were never built, though some work was done on the construction.

In 1810, a population census counted 115, mostly Serbian, households in Bežanija. By the 1850s, a large number of Germans had colonized Bežanija. In 1848–1849 it was part of the Serbian Vojvodina, an ethnic Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire, but in 1849 it was again placed under the administration of the Military Frontier.

As the Frontier was abolished in 1881–1882, it became part of the Syrmia County within the autonomous Habsburg kingdom Croatia-Slavonia, which was located within the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In 1910, the largest ethnic group in the village were Serbs, while other sizable ethnic groups were Germans, Hungarians and Croats. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, in autumn of 1918, Bežanija became part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 24 November 1918, as part of Syrmia region, the village became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and on December 1, it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (future Yugoslavia).

From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County, and from 1922 to 1929 it was part of the Syrmia Oblast. Bežanija became part of the wider Belgrade area for the first time in 1929 after the coup d&#x27;état conducted by the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who redrew Yugoslavia&#x27;s administrative divisions, creating a new administrative unit &quot;Uprava grada Beograda&quot; or &quot;Administration of the City of Belgrade&quot; which comprised Belgrade, Zemun (with Bežanija) and Pančevo.

===Inter-war period===
Between the two world wars of the 20th century, communities sprung up closer to the Sava river, in Staro Sajmište and Novo Naselje. The idea of building a new settlement across the Sava was officially presented in 1922 and the first urbanization plans for Belgrade&#x27;s expansion to the Sava&#x27;s left bank were drawn up in 1923, but a lack of either funds or the manpower needed to drain out the swampy terrain put them on hold indefinitely. Additionally, the Ministry of Construction rejected the city&#x27;s plan of expansion. The project was conceived by Đorđe Kovljanski and it included an idea of creating an island from the Savamala neighborhood (he coined the term &quot;Sava amphitheatre&quot;) in old Belgrade. He even envisioned the bridge across the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, across the Sava, which was finally built in 2012. In 1924 Petar Kokotović opened a kafana on Tošin Bunar with the prophetic name &quot;Novi Beograd&quot;. After 1945, Kokotović was president of the local community of Novo Naselje–Bežanija, which later grew into the municipality of Novi Beograd. In 1924 an airport was built in Bežanija, and in 1928 the &quot;Rogožerski&quot; factory was constructed. In 1934 plans were expanded to include the creation of a new urbanized area connecting Belgrade and Zemun, as Zemun was administratively annexed to the city of Belgrade in 1929, losing its separate city status in 1934. King Alexander Bridge was also built over the Sava River and a tram line connecting Belgrade and Zemun was established. Also, a Zemun airport was built.

A sandy beach with cabins, kafanas and barracks used as sheds by fishermen occupied the area of the modern Ušće quay, north of Branko&#x27;s Bridge. It was one of the favorite vacation spots of Belgraders during the Interbellum period. People traveled there from the city by small boats; the starting point was the small kafana &quot;Malo pristanište&quot; in Savamala. Occupying the left bank of the Sava, it was in the location of the future access ramp for the King Alexander Bridge, so it had to be removed. Several properties were demolished, including numerous kafanas, including &quot;Ostend&quot;, &quot;Zdravlje&quot;, &quot;Abadžija&quot;, &quot;Jadran&quot;, &quot;Krf&quot;, &quot;Dubrovnik&quot;, and &quot;Adrija.&quot; The only one that wasn&#x27;t demolished was &quot;Nica&quot;, predecessor of the modern Ušće restaurant. In total, 20 buildings and 2,000 cabins, barracks, or sheds were demolished, jointly by the municipalities of Zemun and Bežanija, which owned half of the land each, and the property owners. The plan was to build an embankment instead. However, the beach itself survived the construction of the bridge in 1934 as it only made access easier. The beach was finally closed in 1938 when the construction of the embankment began. The beach itself was called Nica (Serbian for Nice, in France) after one of the kafanas.

A group of Danish investors offered to the city government their project of constructing a new settlement between Belgrade and Zemun, on the left bank of the Sava. In February 1937 they sent a very elaborate proposal with maps to the then mayor of Belgrade, Vlada Ilić. The Danes offered to do it for 94 million 1937 dinars and the city administration replied that the project got their fullest attention, but that citizens of Belgrade and Zemun should have a say, too, about this new settlement. In August the Danish investors held a meeting with mayor Ilić. This time, they offered to build the entire modern neighborhood for free, but to retain the right to sell the lots to private buyers who were interested in building houses in the neighborhood, in the total amount of over 80 million dinars, while the city would remain the owner of the land. A contract was signed on 24 February 1938. Danish representatives announced that their ships will reach Belgrade by 12 to 15 May 1938. Among them, there was one special ship. It was to dredge the bottom of the Danube in the vicinity of Great War Island and to eject the dredged earth through pipes in the swamp, filling it. The plan was to fill the area on the right side of the Zemun road, which extended across the King Alexander Bridge across the Sava. It was expected that the work, estimated at 30 million dinars, would be finished by 1940 when the area was to become a nice, dried and elevated filled terrain suitable for the start of the construction of the &quot;newest Belgrade&quot;. The project was described as the &quot;displacement of the Sava confluence into the Danube&quot;.

On 20 May 1938, president of the Yugoslav government Milan Stojadinović, pulled a lever on a Danish excavator, ceremonially starting the works to drain the land at the confluence. The large &quot;Sydhavnen&quot; excavator was transported by ship via the English Channel, the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus, the Black Sea and finally the Danube. It was reported at the time that this was the first time that an ocean ship had anchored in the port of Belgrade. The draining proved to be much more expensive than expected. The &quot;Sydhavnen&quot; excavator sank to the bottom of the Sava river after World War II broke out in 1941, but was lifted out after the war and repaired. It continued to work under the name &quot;Kolubara&quot;.

In 1930s members of Belgrade&#x27;s affluent elite began to buy land from the villagers of Bežanija, which at that time administratively spread all the way to the King Alexander Bridge, which was a dividing point between Bežanija and Zemun. An &quot;Association for the embellishing of the left bank of Sava - New Belgrade&quot; was founded in 1932. From 1933 a settlement, consisting mostly of individual villas, began to develop. Also, a group of White Russian emigrants built several small buildings, mostly rented by the carters who carried goods across the river. As the settlement, which became known as New Belgrade, was built without building permits, authorities threatened to demolish it, but in 1940 government officially &quot;legalized the informal settlement of New Belgrade&quot;. Prior to that, the city already semi-officially recognized the new settlement, as it helped with building its streets and pathways. By 1939 it already had several thousand inhabitants, a representative in the city hall, and was unofficially called New Belgrade.

In 1938, for the purpose of hosting Belgrade Fair, a complex of buildings was erected next to the already existing community. Spread over 15 thousand square metres, it hosted fairs and exhibitions designed to show off the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s developing economy. Also this year, the municipality of Belgrade signed a contract with two Danish construction companies, Kampsax and Højgaard &amp; Schultz, to build the new neighbourhood. Engineer Branislav Nešić was entrusted with leading the project. He even continued his involvement on the project after 1941 when the Nazis conquered, occupied, and dissolved the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because of this, the new communist authorities who came to power after 1945 put Nešić on trial as a collaborator. As the complex never hosted any fairs again and the new Belgrade Fair was built across the river, the area became known as Staro Sajmište (&quot;Old Fairground&quot;).

Though future New Belgrade&#x27;s area was barely urbanized, it already contained the tallest structure, if not a proper building, in Belgrade. After Yugoslav government signed a deal with the Czechoslovakian Škoda Works for the purchase of 300 tanks in 1937, the Škoda decided to donate the towering construction as the parachuting attraction. The Škoda Tower, a &quot;parachutists tower&quot;, was opened on 2 June 1938. The tall latticed steel construction was the tallest structure in Belgrade. The tower was an imposing and domineering structure, which, due to its height and position in the flat and low terrain, was visible from all parts of Belgrade from across the river. It was claimed to be the tallest facility of its kind in both Europe and the world. It was used both for the professional training of the parachutists, but also for the amateur jumps by the fair visitors.

On 22 February 1941, mayor of Belgrade Jovan Tomić and architect Dragiša Brašovan held a press conference, announcing plans for the future. The plans were made for New Belgrade and the Sava&#x27;s bank in &quot;Old&quot; Belgrade. The new town was to be built on and have 500,000 inhabitants, even though the entire Belgrade at that time had a bit over 350,000 people. Tomić issued a ban for the private owners to purchase the land, so that all land designated for the future town will remain city owned. He also asked from the state government to banish all private land owners on the Sava&#x27;s right bank, located between the Belgrade Main railway station and the river and to confiscate the land. Further plans included the filling of the arm of the Danube and turning the Great War Island into the peninsula and erection of the monumental memorial on it. The project also included two new bridges across the Sava, which would connect the old and the new part of the city, one on the location of the modern Gazela bridge (which was built in 1970) and another in the continuation of the Nemanjina Street. Because of the latter bridge, Tomić planned to demolish the building of the Belgrade Main railway station and relocate the facility in the neighborhood of Prokop, thus clearing further of space for the commercial facilities. Construction of the new railway station in Prokop indeed began, but in 1977 and as of 2018 is still not finished, though in 2017 it took over the domestic transportation.

In general (excluding Bežanija), on the territory of modern New Belgrade, urbanization between two world wars began on three locations: along the Sava bank, stretching from Sajmište to Ušće; workers settlement around Old Airport; informal settlement at Tošin Bunar, where modern Studentski Grad is today. Majority of the construction was informal.

===World War II===
In 1941, German forces occupied much of Yugoslavia. The Nazi secret police, the Gestapo, took over the fairgrounds (&quot;Sajmište&quot;). They encircled it with several rings of barbed wire, turning it into a &quot;collection centre&quot;. It eventually became an extermination camp, the Sajmište concentration camp. Until May 1942 it was mostly used to kill off Jews from Belgrade and other parts of Serbia, and from April 1942 onwards, it also held political prisoners. Executions of captured prisoners lasted as long as the camp existed. November 1946 report released by the Yugoslav State Commission for Crimes of Occupiers and their Collaborators claims that close to 100,000 prisoners came through the Sajmište&#x27;s gates. It is estimated that around 48,000 people perished inside the camp.

The Škoda Tower managed to survive all the bombings during the war, so as fighting during the Belgrade offensive in October 1944. New Communist authorities decided to demolish it, and though the exact reason why is unknown, it is suspected this was because of the highly negative perception among the citizens due to the role the tower had during the war years when it was equipped with searchlights and several machine gun nests to monitor the area and the river, and to stop those trying to escape the lager, earning the moniker &quot;death tower&quot;. Located in the southeast corner of the Sajmište complex, it was demolished in November 1945. The next Belgrade structure that would surpass the tower&#x27;s height was the tall Beograđanka building in 1974, almost 30 years later. Nothing remained of the tower, and a football pitch of FK Brodarac was built on its location.

===Rapid development===

The first sketches of urban plans were developed by Nikola Dobrović in 1946 and preparations began in 1947. The first news on the project were published in daily &quot;Politika&quot; on 5 January 1947. The project was still referred to as &quot;new Belgrade&quot;, with a lowercase &quot;n&quot; pointing to the description rather than the new city&#x27;s proper name. Architect Mihajlo Mitrović called New Belgrade &quot;an obsessive vision of Dobrović&quot;. A monograph on the construction of New Belgrade by Slobodan Ristanović described what the area looked liked before the city was built: &quot;In the thick reeds and bulrush there were many snakes and frogs, fishes and leeches. Above this swamp, flocks of birds circled and the swarms of mosquitos and other insects were going up and down. Just a few houses and an occasional shack in the marsh around the Zemun airport, so as the derelict neighborhood of Staro Sajmište attested the human presence in that inhospitable ambience.&quot;

It was on 11 April 1948, three years after World War II ended, that the ground was broken on a huge construction project, which would give birth to what is known today as New Belgrade. During first three years of construction alone, over 200,000 workers and engineers from all over the freshly liberated country took part in the building process. The housing project was also constructed in order to minimize Roma negation of assimilating into society by mass free housing in New Belgrade as a way to incentivize them to culturally integrate. Work brigades, parts of the Youth work actions made up of villagers brought in from rural Serbia provided most of the manual labour. Even high school and university student volunteers took part. It was backbreaking labour that went on day and night. With no notable technological tools to speak of, mixing of concrete and spreading of sand were done by hand with horse carriages only used for extremely heavy lifting. The concept of Youth work actions continued up to 1990 and the objects built this way include the Studentski Grad, Block 7, Block 7a, Paviljoni, Gazela Bridge, Hospital Bežanijska Kosa, SIV, etc.

Before the actual construction started, the terrain was evenly covered with sand from the Sava and the Danube rivers in an effort to dry out the land and raise it above the reach of flooding and underground streams. From 1947 to 1950 over 200,000 voluntary workers were employed in the construction of the new city. The first building which was officially opened was the Workers University, which was opened on 29 November 1949. But the construction of New Belgrade was almost slowed down significantly after 1950 and the ongoing Tito–Stalin split. The full, rapid development continued after 1960. Many apartments were assigned for the officers of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. At one point, 80% of the officers opted to move to New Belgrade.

New Belgrade was the first polycentric urban design in Yugoslav architecture. Among the first to go up was the SIV 1 building, which housed the Federal Executive Council (SIV). The building has 75,000 square metres of usable space. Built during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was also used during the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before its dissolution. The building was renamed to Palace of Serbia, and now houses some departments of the Serbian government.

First buildings for classic residential purposes were built as pavilions close to the area known as Tošin Bunar (Toša&#x27;s Well). Studentski Grad (Student City) complex was also built around the same time to meet the residence needs of the growing University of Belgrade student body that came from other parts of Yugoslavia. Base for the first phase in city&#x27;s development was Belgrade&#x27;s general plan from 1950. Area was divided in blocks. First finished ones were blocks 1 and 2. Designed by Branko Petričić, and still considered &quot;experimental&quot; at the time, they were finished in 1958.

Buildings sprung up one after another and by 1952, New Belgrade was officially a municipality. In 1955 the municipality of Bežanija was annexed to New Belgrade. It was for years the biggest construction site in Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia and a huge source of pride for country&#x27;s communist authorities that oversaw the project.

One of the major successes during the construction was the arrangement and planting of the greenery. The main obstacle was the, now sandy, terrain. Still, the planting of the parks began after 1956. In 1961, the Park of Friendship was opened, to commemorate the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. Park itself is part of much larger Park Ušće. Also in the 1960s, the arrangement of the promenades along the Sava and the Danube began.

On 20 October 1971, a major commercial complex was opened in Block 11-C, along the Lenin Boulevard (modern Mihajlo Pupin Boulevard). It included the Mercator Shopping Mall (today known as Old Mercator), which at the time was the largest shopping mall in Yugoslavia with the total retail floor area of . Other parts of the complex include the roofed farmers&#x27; market, garage with several hundred parking spaces and the Mercator Department Store, the largest one in Belgrade at that point. Northern section of the complex was occupied by the 600-seats multipurpose cinema hall &quot;Jugoslavija&quot; (cinema now defunct) and hotel &quot;Putnik&quot;, designed by Mihajlo Mitrović, today part of the Tulip Inn hotel chain.

In general, development of New Belgrade is divided in four major phases, all of which have a landmark buildings constructed in that periods:

a) First phase (1948–1958)
* completion of the first residential blocks, 7 and 7a;
* founding of the first local community “Pionor” (now Paviljoni);
* completion of the Studentski Grad (1949–1955).

b) Second phase (1958–1968)
* Friendship Park and SIV (Palace of Serbia) completed in 1961;
* Building of the Municipality of New Belgrade finished (1961–64);
* Museum of Contemporary Art finished in 1965;
* Ušće Tower, completed in 1964
* Hotel Jugoslavija Opened 1968

c) Third phase (1968–2000)
* Residential blocks 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 45 and 70 (first half of the 1970s)
* Sava Centar with Hotel Intercontinental (now Crowne Plaza Belgrade) opened in 1977.
* Western City Gate finished in 1980

* Belville Complex, opened in 2009
* Sava City Opened in 2009
* Airport City Belgrade
* Ušće Shopping Mall, opened in 2009
* A Block, still in construction

=== 21st century ===

In 2010, the first international architectural design competition in almost 30 years was organized for one of the future symbols of Belgrade in Block 39. It was the project of the Center for Promotion of Science. Out of 232 submissions, the work of Wolfgang Tschapeller was selected. The design of an elevated, ethereal building, which was to appear from distance as hovering, was supported by the architects, but not much by the public. Main problem was the price. Initially estimated to cost €10 million and to be finished by 2014, the projected price skyrocketed to €65 million and the construction never began. Local architects now called the project a colossal waste of money and in 2015 government scrapped the project all together. In July 2020 it was announced that the massive new police building will be built on the location, which remained undeveloped.

Since the 2000s, and especially in the 2010s, the rapid development resumed in the southwest half of the municipality, bounded by the streets Tošin Bunar, Vojvođanska, Milutina Milankovića and Sava&#x27;s left bank. Prior to this. one of the central streets in the neighborhood, Omladinskih Brigada, was urbanized &quot;here and there&quot;, with buildings humble in both architectural merits or functionality and this section of New Belgrade was considered to be neglected in terms or architecture and urbanism. In one decade, new boulevards were constructed (Heroes of Košare Boulevard), while numerous large buildings and objects sprawled along the boulevards, including some entire neighborhoods and residential or business blocks: Airport City Belgrade, Delta City, West 65 (will be tall), Savada, A Block, Novi Minel, Roda shopping mall, Ekstra shopping mall, hotels, gas stations, many business highrise, etc.

By 2020, this urban development was considered mostly positive, as being functional and credited with lifting New Belgrade&#x27;s business and commercial quality to the highest level in all of Belgrade. Especially commended objects include Airport City, West 65, string of business building along the Omladinskih Brigada street, complex in Block 41-A, Holiday Inn hotel and a bit older headquarters of the municipal Tax Administration. Criticized projects are several buildings, representatives of the &quot;investors urbanism&quot;, where building was constructed by the wishes of the investors, no matter what (like the building at 11 Milutina Milankovića). Though the plans were made already in the 1970s, New Belgrade got its first fire station only on 23 March 2022, in Block 67-A.

Development of Block 26, between the Palace of Serbia (former SIV 1), and the Belgrade Arena, began in the early 2000s. Several modern six-floor buildings were constructed, so as the Serbian Orthodox Church dedicated to the Saint Simeon the Myrrh-streaming, and the clergy house. Half of the area remained filled with the auxiliary structures and temporary gravel and cement storage, left from the construction of the Arena. Architectural design competition for the entire block was won by Jovan Mitrović and Dejan Miljković in 2006. It includes construction of three buildings facing three streets - Mihajlo Pupin Boulevard ( tall, 17 floors), Antifašističke Borbe (), and Španskih Boraca (), and a row of four tall skyscrapers along the fourth side, the Zoran Đinđić Boulevard. This was confirmed in 2016, and revised in 2019 to allow more residential space in the buildings. Preparatory works on the construction of the building across the Palace of Serbia began in July 2022. Design includes kindergarten, ambulance, while the central part will partially fulfil the original plans for the blocks 24 to 26, as the center of New Belgrade: it will be turned into the wide promenade, with ponds and fountains.

By the 2020s, construction in New Belgrade was completely influenced by the investors&#x27; urbanism, which, caring only about the investors&#x27; interests and profits, was turning every available free or green area into buildings. Finished in the early 1970s, Block 45 contains 71% of either green areas or empty space with natural ground. Block 19a, finished in 1981, has 60%, while Block 70a, from the same decade, has 64%. Block 29, completed in 2006, has only 23% of such areas. In the cases of the A Block (in Block 67a, 2019), and West 65 (still under construction in 2023), in a period of the full-blown investors&#x27; urbanism, green areas are reduced to 14% and 8%, respectively. Even if there are remaining, free spaces, the investors arrange decorative lawns, which have no natural (soil, earth) foundations. This resulted in elevated temperatures in neighborhood&#x27;s microclimate and highly reduced absorption of torrential rains, so the streets of New Belgrade are almost regularly flooded with every heavy rain.

==Neighbourhoods==
Just like other municipalities of Serbia, New Belgrade is further divided into &quot;local communities&quot; (Serbian: &quot;mesna zajednica&quot;). Apart from Bežanija and Staro Sajmište, no other neighbourhoods have historical or traditional names, as Novi Beograd did not exist as such. However, in the five decades of its existence, some of its parts gradually became known as distinct neighborhoods of their own.

List of the neighborhoods of New Belgrade:
==Blocks==


New Belgrade is divided into 72 blocks, some of which are further divided into subblocks. The blocks are not numerated one after another: for example, there are Blocks 26 and 28, but there is no Block 27. The one-digit blocks are the oldest.

* Block 5 hosts the Ranko Žeravica Sports Hall, the oldest sports object in New Belgrade. The FK IMT Stadium, the home arena of FK IMT is also located there.
* Block 6 is small and distinctly green, setting it apart from the other blocks. It is known as New Belgrade&#x27;s Dedinje, after the wealthiest part of the city.
* Block 11A is home to the Embassy of Japan, as well as the Chinese Cultural Centre built in place of the Embassy of China which was damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The Historical Archive of Belgrade is located in Block 11B, while the Old Mercator (Serbian: Stari Merkator) shopping centre is situated in Block 11C.
* Block 13 is almost entirely taken up by the Palace of Serbia and the surrounding green area. Stretching to cover a floor area 65,000 m2, it is almost 13 times larger than the White House. The Palace is officially protected by the state as immovable cultural property.
* Block 16 is dominated by the Ušće Shopping Center, as well as the two Ušće Towers. Built in 1964 and 2020, these are the third- and sixth-tallest buildings in Belgrade, respectively.
* Block 21 is famous for its six residential highrises known as the &quot;Six Corporals&quot; (Serbian: Šest kaplara), as well as a long, winding &quot;B-7&quot; building, informally known as &quot;Meander&quot;, &quot;Snake&quot; (Serbian: Zmijica), or &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; (Serbian: Kineski zid). Being the longest building in the city, it is one kilometer long and houses more 3,500 people.
* Block 28 houses long, narrow residential buildings known as &quot;televizorke&quot; (from Serbian &quot;televizor&quot;, meaning &quot;TV&quot;, literally &quot;TV buildings&quot;. In addition to that, the &quot;Horseshoe&quot; (Serbian: Potkovica) building is also located there.
* Block 30 is primarily residential. Initially intended for foreign investors and diplomats, the block was later constructed with primarily social housing in mind. In addition to that, a hotel was supposed to be built, although the construction was never started. Today, the block also houses the building of the United Nations missions in Serbia, complete with a mural commemorating nature.
* Block 32 is home to the Church of the Holy Great Martyr Demetrius and the Embassy of Slovakia, as well as a newly-built residential condominium complex.
* Block 33 is known for the massive Western City Gate, one of the symbols of the capital.
* Block 34 hosts the settlement of Studentski Grad, as well as the student dormitory with the same name. The dormitory is the largest in Belgrade, with a capacity of almost 4,500 student beds.
* Block 42 is home to the newly-opened Belgrade Bus Station. The station is available via all four of tram lines passing through New Belgrade - 7, 9, 11 and 13 - as well as several bus lines.
* Block 44 hosts the Pyramid shopping centre (Serbian: Piramida), where the Faculty of Business Studies and Law of the private Union–Nikola Tesla University is located. Furthermore, a waterpark was supposed to be built by the Sava&#x27;s riverbank, but its construction was abandoned in 2006 after being started in 2005.
* Block 45, also known as the &quot;Sun Settlement&quot; (Serbian: Naselje sunca), is home to 45 residential highrises, as well as 23 lower-story buildings, where about 18,000 people live. Block 45 has long had a poor reputation as the &quot;fortress&quot; of football ultras such as Grobari (Serbian: Grobari, meaning &quot;gravediggers&quot;). Graffiti are a well-known feature of the block: some of the first street art in Serbia was made there.
* Block 64 used to house a major industrial zone of the IMT and FMO companies. Since their privatisation, plans have appeared to build massive residential complexes.
* Block 65 hosts the Airport City Belgrade (Serbian: Erport Siti) business park built where the hangars of Belgrade&#x27;s old airport once stood. The airport itself was destroyed in the WW2, and the new Nikola Tesla Airport was built in Surčin. A single hangar of the old airport remained intact, and it is now a protected cultural monument. The new West 65 residential complex is also located there, complete with a forty-story tower.
* Block 67 is home to the modern Belville residential complex and the Delta City shopping centre.

==Architecture==

The Old Elementary School in Bežanija, at 68 Vojvođanska Street, was built in 1891. A standard object of its kind, designed by the subdued postulates of the Academism, it was declared a cultural monument in January 2019. It is the oldest preserved building on the territory of the modern municipality of New Belgrade.

=== Ikarus building ===

As of 2018, one of the oldest surviving buildings in New Belgrade is the former administrative building of the &quot;Ikarus&quot; company, built in 1938. It is located in the modern Block 9-a, at 3-a &quot;Gramšijeva&quot; street. In June 2017 it was announced that the building will be demolished so that private investor can build a highrise instead. Locals organized in an effort to adapt the building into the museum instead. City government, which in 2015 stated that the building will not be demolished, issued a demolition permit in February 2018. Citizen protested, demolished the construction hoarding and physically preventing the investor to destroy the building, so police intervened. Investor then posted a board which showed that the original building will be preserved but vastly expanded and superstructured (total of floor area). Still, a heavy demolition machinery was brought so citizens protested again in March. Inheritors of the pre-World War II owners of the &quot;Ikarus&quot; company, which was nationalized after 1945, applied for the restitution.

The administrative building of the former airplane factory was a symbol of the industrial development of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the Interbellum. Apart from being one of the oldest preserved objects in New Belgrade, it was the only representative of the Art Deco in the municipality. Citizens proposed that the building might be adapted into the Museum of New Belgrade or a branch of the Museum of Aviation. The building was not protected by the law. Still, the building was demolished in July 2018.

=== After 1945 ===


Architects who are most deserving for New Belgrade&#x27;s development are Uroš Martinović, Milutin Glavički, Milosav Mitić, Dušan Milenković and Leonid Lenarčić. They drafted the city&#x27;s regulatory plan in 1962 which encompassed all the previous ideas, solutions and propositions.

New Belgrade developed on Le Corbusier&#x27;s principles of the &quot;sun city&quot;, which includes many green areas and infrastructure which can easily be upgraded. In general, city developed in the style of urban modern architecture and is considered to be a major representative of that style, along with Brasília in Brazil, Chandigarh in India and Velenje in Slovenia.

Characteristic for the buildings in New Belgrade is that many of them got nicknames. Best known ones include:
* &quot;Šest kaplara&quot; (Six corporals), Block 21, as most apartments were settled by the military personnel and their families;
* &quot;Televizorka&quot; (TV-screen building), Block 28, due to the look of its windows; on 21 March 2020, a fire broke out on the eight floor, ultimately killing seven people;
* &quot;Tri sestre&quot; (Three sisters), Fontana, three identical buildings;
* &quot;Potkovica&quot; (Horseshoe), Block 28, due to its shape; 
* &quot;Pendrek&quot;, &quot;Sirotica&quot; and &quot;Besna kobila&quot; (Police baton, Poor girl and Mad mare), near Studentski Grad, as the first was populated by the policemen&#x27;s families, second by the socially endangered and third by the well-to-do members of the Communist party;
* &quot;Mercedes&quot;, Block 38, three connected buildings in the shape of the car&#x27;s logo;
* &quot;Lamela&quot; or &quot;Meander&quot;, Block 21; next to &quot;Šest kaplara&quot;, with it is the longest residential building in former Yugoslavia. It was built from 1960 to 1966 and officially named &quot;B-7&quot;, but it is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Great Wall&quot; or &quot;Chinese Wall&quot;.

=== Protection ===

The central section of New Belgrade was declared a cultural monument in January 2021, as the protected spatial cultural-historical unit. It includes nine blocks, from No. 21 to No. 30, in three proper rows, three by three (block No. 27 ever existed). The three central ones, 24, 25 and 26, were originally left unbuilt, as they were planned as the three central squares, the main &quot;prospekt&quot; of the city, with each square given a specific role: ceremonial, central and traffic hub. This was later abandoned and the blocks were urbanized in time. In 2019, the depictions of block No. 23 became part of the permanent exhibition in the New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. Though this central area was envisioned by the original planners of the city, individual blocks were later designed by other architects. Residential complexes in blocks 22 and 23 were designed by Aleksandar Stjepanović, Božidar Janković and Branislav Karadžić.

Block 23 was built from 1969 to 1976 and was financed by the army. Though in the brutalism style, prevailing in New Belgrade at the time, the design avoided the stripped, rigid rules of the style. The loggias and windows are ornamented with concrete bars, the facades are vertically divided with vertical dividing lines protruding above the gables. The windows have additional horizontal frames. Critics labeled it the &quot;brutalist baroque&quot;. The block is conceived as having tall, military buildings on the edge, serving as &quot;sentinels&quot; of the inside, which is filled with rows of buildings in cubical or meandering shapes, including the elementary school &quot;Laza Kostić&quot; which occupies the central part. During the construction, the prefabricated panels of reinforced concrete were used, patented by . Interiors are designed in the manner of the &quot;Belgrade apartment&quot; - units with central core which both serves as the living room and connects all other rooms, enabling &quot;family communication&quot;.

==Demographics==
Ever since the construction began in 1948, New Belgrade experienced explosive population growth, but this trend stopped during the 1990s and became negative. As of 2022, the municipality of New Belgrade has a population of 209,763 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
The ethnic composition of the municipality (as of 2022)
==Economy==

As all of the socialist governments considered heavy industry to be the driving force of the entire economy, it for decades dominated New Belgrade&#x27;s economy too: Industry of Machinery and Tractors (IMT), Metallic cast iron factory (FOM), shipyard &quot;Beograd&quot; (formerly &quot;Tito&quot;), large heating plant in Savski Nasip, &quot;MINEL&quot; electro-construction company, etc. All of these complexes will be removed and develop in business and residential areas.

In the 1990s with the collapse of gigantic state-owned companies, New Belgrade&#x27;s local economy bounced back by switching to commercial facilities, with dozens of shopping malls and entire commercial sections such as Mercator Center Belgrade, Ušće Mall, Delta City Belgrade etc. These activities are further enhanced in the 2000s (decade). The &#x27;Open Shopping Mall&#x27; or the Belgrade&#x27;s flea market is also located in New Belgrade.

New Belgrade became the Central business district in Serbia and one of major in Southeast Europe. Many companies choose New Belgrade for regional centers such as IKEA, Energoprojekt holding, Delta Holding, MK Group, DHL, Air Serbia, OMV, Siemens, Société Générale, Telekom Srbija, Telenor Serbia, Unilever, Vip mobile, Yugoimport SDPR, Ericsson, Colliers International, CB Richard Ellis, SNC-Lavalin, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, Ernst &amp; Young and Arabtec. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is also located in New Belgrade. Other notable structures built not too long afterwards include convention and congress hall Sava Center, Hotel Jugoslavija, Genex condominium, Genex Tower sports and concert venues Hala Sportova and Belgrade Arena, and 4 and 5-star hotels Crowne Plaza Belgrade, Holiday Inn, Hyatt Regency, Tulip Inn etc., with around 1700 rooms... Many structures are currently under construction like Airport City Belgrade, Elektroprivreda Srbije HQ., West 65 business-residential complex, etc.

Many IT companies choose New Belgrade as regional center like NCR Corporation, Cisco Systems, SAP AG, Acer, ComTrade Group,
Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, Samsung. One of Microsoft&#x27;s development centers is also located in New Belgrade.

Currently finished projects in New Belgrade are Delta City, Sava City, Univerzitetsko Selo, Ada Bridge, Intesa HQ and Ušće Tower.

In 2019. average price of square meter of an apartment in New Belgrade was €1.650. Average net salary in New Belgrade in December 2019 was $960. It contains also the most expensive areas for buying an apartment in Belgrade as A Blok (2.920 €) and West 65 (5.000 €). 

The following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):
==Projects under construction in New Belgrade==

== Transportation ==

Several important thoroughfares run through New Belgrade, along with numerous wide boulevards that criss-cross most of its territory.

The A3 motorway (carrying E70 and E75) runs northwest to southeast, with five exits. It crosses the Sava River via Gazela Bridge. New Belgrade is served by two more road bridges – Branko&#x27;s Bridge and Ada Bridge, and by the road-tram Old Sava Bridge.

With services started in 1985, tram transportation plays an important role in New Belgrade transportation, despite it having just two tracks which mostly run along the several kilometers long Jurija Gagarina street. Four tram lines serve the municipality (7, 9, 11 and 13) and there is a tram depot in Đorđa Stanojevića street.

Since the 1970s, New Belgrade has been served by two railway lines connecting it to the city center and by one line to . Virtually the entire length of these lines is on an embankment, with an elevated segment on the approach to the New Railroad Bridge, and a tunnel toward Zemun. Two railway stations exist, the larger being the which is located above the Antifašističke borbe street and is served by BG Voz and other local and international lines. The other railway station is which is a 2-track stop located just outside Bežanija tunnel.

The international fairway on the Sava runs along the banks of New Belgrade. The only public river transportation is run by two seasonal boat lines from Blok 70 to Ada Ciganlija, and by another one connecting Blok 44 to Ada Međica.

Belgrade&#x27;s main shipyard is located on New Belgrade&#x27;s Sava bank. On the Danube, the base of the 2nd River Squadron of Serbian River Flotilla is located next to the confluence of the Sava, which restricts navigation around Little War Island.

From 1927 to 1964 the international Dojno polje Airport was located on the territory of today&#x27;s New Belgrade.

==Culture and education==
For a settlement of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists&#x27; ideas how a new and modern city should look like. If it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader&#x27;s feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.

Museum of Contemporary Art is located in Ušće which is also projected by the city government as the location of the future Belgrade Opera. The issue became highly controversial in the 2000s (decade) as the general feel of the population, ensemble of the opera and most prominent architects and artists is that it is a very bad location for the opera, while the city government stubbornly insists against the popular wishes.

For decades, the only church in the municipality was an old Church of Saint George in Bežanija. Construction of the new church in Bežanijska Kosa, the Church of Saint Basil of Ostrog, began in 1996, while the construction of the Church of Saint Demetrius of Salonica, which is considered the first church in New Belgrade, began in 1998. Both are still not completed.

===Schools===
Education fared much better than culture, as there are numerous elementary and high schools, as well as University of Belgrade&#x27;s residential campus – Studentski Grad.

List of schools in New Belgrade:

* Graphic Design Secondary School
* Megatrend University
* Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium
* Polytechnical Academy
* Polytechnic-High School for New Sciences
* Russian School
* Technical School
* Tenth Belgrade Gymnasium
* University of Arts&#x27; Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU)
==Night life==
New Belgrade offers rich night life along the banks of Sava and Danube, right up to the point where the two rivers meet. What started mostly as raft-like social clubs for river fishermen in the 1980s expanded into large floats offering food and drink with live turbo folk performances during the 1990s.

Today, it is unlikely that one would walk a stretch along the rivers without encountering a float. Some of them grew into entire entertainment complexes rivaling clubs in Belgrade&#x27;s downtown core. While most of the floats used to be synonymous with turbo folk in what was essentially a stereotypical &quot;kafana&quot; setting, a recent trend saw many turned into full-fledged clubs on water with elaborate events involving world-famous DJs spinning live music.

==Public image==


Not much attention was paid to detail and subtlety when New Belgrade was being built during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The objective was clearly to put up as many buildings as fast as possible, in order to accommodate a displaced and growing post-World War II population that was in the middle of a baby boom. This across-the-board brutalist architectural approach led to many apartment buildings and even entire residential blocks looking monumental in an awkward way. Although the problem has been alleviated to certain extent in recent decades by addition of some modern expansion (Hyatt and Intercontinental hotels, luxury Genex condos, Ušće Tower, Belgrade Arena, Delta City, etc.), many still complain about what they see as New Belgrade&#x27;s &quot;grayness&quot; and &quot;drabness&quot;. They often use the derisive term &quot;spavaonica&quot; (&quot;dormitory&quot;) to underscore their view of New Belgrade as a place that does not inspire creative living nor encourage healthy human interaction, and is only good for overnight sleep at the end of the hard day&#x27;s work. This opinion has found its way into Serbian pop culture as well.

In an early 1980s track called &#x27;Neću da živim u Bloku 65&#x27;, popular Serbian band Riblja čorba sings about a depressed individual who hates the world because he&#x27;s surrounded by the concrete of New Belgrade, while a more recent local cinematic trend sees New Belgrade presented somewhat clumsily as the Serbian version of New York ghettos like those found in Harlem, Brooklyn and The Bronx. The most obvious example of the latter would be 2002 movie &quot;1 na 1&quot;, which portrays a bunch of Serbian teenagers who rap, shoot guns, play street basketball and seem to blame many of their woes on living in New Belgrade. Other films like &quot;Apsolutnih 100&quot; and &quot;The Wounds&quot; also implicitly paint New Belgrade in the negative light but they have a more coherent point of view and place their stories within the context of the 1990s when war and international isolation truly did push some Serbs, including those inhabiting New Belgrade, to desperate acts.

<doc id="993845" wikidata="Q1054376" url="?curid=993845" title="United States nationality law">
<text>United States nationality law details the conditions in which a person holds United States nationality. In the United States, nationality is typically obtained through provisions in the U.S. Constitution, various laws, and international agreements. Citizenship is established as a right under the Constitution, not as a privilege, for those born in the United States under its jurisdiction and those who have been &quot;naturalized&quot;. While the words &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;national&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, &quot;national&quot; is a broader legal term, such that a person can be a &quot;national&quot; but not a &quot;citizen&quot;, while &quot;citizen&quot; is reserved to &quot;nationals&quot; who have the status of citizenship.

Individuals born in any of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia or almost any inhabited territory are United States citizens (and nationals) by birthright. The sole exception is American Samoa, where individuals are typically non-citizen U.S. nationals at birth. Additionally, individuals born from foreign diplomats working in the United States are neither citizens nor nationals. Foreign nationals living in any state or qualified territory may naturalize after going through the legal process of qualifying as permanent residents and meeting a residence requirement (normally five years).

==History==
===Constitutional foundation===
Nationality defines the legal relationship between a person and a state or nation, specifying who is a member or subject of a particular nation. The rights and obligations of citizenship are defined by this relationship, as well as the protections to which nationals are entitled. Though nationality and citizenship are distinct and the United States recognizes the distinction between those who are entitled or not entitled to rights, its statutes typically use the words &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;citizenship&quot; instead of &quot;national&quot; and &quot;nationality&quot;. The Constitution of the United States did not define either nationality or citizenship, but in Article 1, section 8, clause 4 gave Congress the authority to establish a naturalization law. Before the American Civil War and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, there was no other language in the Constitution dealing with nationality.

===Nationality laws 1790–1866===
The first statute to define nationality and naturalization in the United States was the Naturalization Act of 1790. It limited those who were eligible to be nationals as free, white persons. Following the practices of English common law, the legal system of the United States absorbed coverture, or the assumption that a woman&#x27;s loyalty and obligations to her spouse were more important than her loyalty and obligation to the nation. While the Nationality Act did not forbid a woman to have her own nationality, judicial rulings and custom on domestic matters established that infants, slaves, and women were unable to participate in public life, as a result of the belief that they lacked critical judgment and had no right to exercise free will or control property. Native Americans were considered to be subjects of foreign governments and per decisions like &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 1857) were only eligible to become naturalized if they assimilated white culture. From 1802, only fathers were able to pass on their nationality to their children. The Naturalization Act of 1804 confirmed that a woman&#x27;s nationality was dependent upon her marital status and the Naturalization Act of 1855 tied a wife&#x27;s nationality, and that of her children, to her husband&#x27;s. A wife who married a foreign husband in this period was assumed to have suspended her nationality in favor of his. She was able to repatriate upon termination of the marriage and resumption of residence in the United States. While the 1855 Act specified that foreign wives gained U.S. nationality, the law created confusion as to whether it required American women who married aliens to take the nationality of the spouse. For example, Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S. Grant, reacquired her U.S. nationality in 1898 by an Act of Congress, after a divorce from a British husband.

===Expansions and interpretations 1866 to 1900===
In the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and later that year passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to grant citizenship status to former slaves. The language of the Amendment was race-neutral and granted nationality to anyone born in the United States and subject to their jurisdiction. It did not extend nationality to Native Americans. In &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot; (112 U.S. 94, 1884) the Supreme Court confirmed that those Native Americans who were born subject to tribal jurisdiction did not have birthright nationality in United States territory.

===Restrictions and interpretations 1900 to 1965===
Under the Insular Cases of 1901, the Supreme Court ruled that unincorporated territories and insular possessions of the United States, which were not on a path toward statehood, had limited applicability of the U.S. Constitution. At the time, these included Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, acquired in 1898 at the end of the Spanish–American War. According to the decision, those born in insular possessions or unincorporated territories were not eligible for citizenship, though they were considered nationals and could hold a U.S. passport and gain diplomatic protection from the United States. Passage of the Expatriation Act of 1907 eliminated the uncertainty created in 1855, definitively stating that marriage solely determined all women&#x27;s nationality. The law immediately revoked the nationality of married women, regardless of whether they were born in the United States or naturalized, if they were married to a non-citizen. It was retroactive and did not require a wife&#x27;s consent, leaving many women unaware that they had lost their nationality.

The federal Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 were passed by Congress to address the concern that white authority was declining. The 1921 Act, known as the Emergency Quota Act, restricted immigration from various countries. The limits applied to foreign husbands and children of U.S.-born women, but provided an exemption for foreign wives and children of birthright male nationals. In 1922, the Cable Act was passed, declaring that an American woman could not be denied the right to naturalize because she was married. It established procedures for women, who had previously lost their citizenship because of marriage, to repatriate as naturalized (not birthright) citizens. A wife&#x27;s nationality depended on residence and her husband&#x27;s eligibility to naturalize; if she lived abroad, her nationality on re-entry to U.S. territory was therefore subject to the restrictions of the Quota Act. However, because the Cable Act was worded to specifically state that &quot;women citizens&quot; who married ineligible foreigners lost their nationality, it did not apply to American Samoan women, as they were non-citizen nationals.

Under the terms of the 1924 act, also known as the Asian Exclusion Act, Asians were not allowed to enter the country and were excluded from naturalization. It stated that an American-born woman whose nationality was lost because of marriage, regardless of whether that marriage had terminated, was ineligible for naturalization and was considered to have been &quot;born in the country of which [they were] a citizen or subject&quot;. The Supreme Court ruling of 1923, in &quot;United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind&quot;, retroactively removed the nationality of Asian men, automatically revoking their wives&#x27; nationality. If a U.S. woman married to a man of Asian descent left the country, she could not be readmitted to the United States. Husbands could petition for an exception allowing their foreign-born wives to lawfully immigrate, but wives were unable to petition for their husbands. Immediately after passage of the 1924 Act, the Department of Labor Secretary, James Davis, recommended extending its provisions to immigrants from Mexico and other countries in the Americas. Every year from 1926 to 1930, Congress considered bills evaluating imposing quotas for immigration from the other nations in the western hemisphere. In June 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act granted Native Americans, unilaterally, nationality in the United States.

In 1933, the United States delegation to the Pan-American Union&#x27;s Montevideo conference, Alexander W. Weddell and Joshua Butler Wright signed the Inter-American Convention on the Nationality of Women, which became effective in 1934, legally reserving limitations for domestic legislative review. The Equal Nationality Act of 1934 was the first statute that allowed derivative nationality for children born abroad to pass from their mother. Their nationality was dependent on whether the mother had resided in the United States before the child was born. As the law was not retroactive, children born before 1934 were typically prevented from deriving citizenship from their mother. The statute also provided preferential naturalization for any foreign spouse married to a U.S. national. It stated that eligible foreigners, who met all other requirements of naturalization, could naturalize under reduced requirements forgoing a declaration of intent and needing only three years of continuous residency within the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.

Amendments to the Cable Act and nationality laws continued until 1940, when married women were granted their own nationality without restriction. That year, Congress amended the Nationality Act, distinguishing for the first time different rules for derivative nationality for legitimate and illegitimate children. Under the provisions, children born out of wedlock passed from mother to child automatically, but required legitimization of paternity prior to a child reaching the age of majority for derivative nationality from the father. The 1940 Act also allowed all women who had previously lost their citizenship because of marriage to repatriate without regard to their marital status, by swearing the oath of allegiance, as opposed to the previous policy of repatriation by naturalization. Racial exclusions for derivative naturalization of husbands of U.S.-citizen wives remained in place until passage of the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952. Though it ended utilizing race as a criterion for admission to the country of nationalization, continued use of quotas to restrict immigration from Asian countries did not end racial exclusion. Until immigration laws were reformed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the restrictive quota system remained in place.

===Refinements and interpretations 1966 to 2001===
Until 1972, the Nationality Laws of the United States required that children born abroad to U.S. nationals complete a five-year residency by establishing a continuous domicile in the territory prior to their twenty-third birthday. Failure to establish a residence nullified U.S. nationality and citizenship. In 1982, Congress enacted provisions for children born between 1950 and 1982 to facilitate immigration for children of U.S. national fathers. Intended to assist children born in areas where the U.S. had been militarily active, it applied to children born in Kampuchea, Korea, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The special provisions did not give children nationality, but loosened the requirements for legitimization and financial support for children born abroad, removed scrutiny of the father&#x27;s marital status, requiring only that the Attorney General establish that a presumed father was a citizen and that a sponsor agreed to take legal custody and support a child under the age of eighteen. In 1987, the Amerasian Homecoming Act facilitated resettlement of immigrant Vietnamese mothers and their children born between 1962 and 1972 to U.S. military personnel.

In 1989, a ruling in the case of &quot;Elias v. United States Department of State&quot; (721 F. Supp. 243, N.C. Cal 1989) confirmed that a child born abroad prior to 1934 to a U.S.-born woman could obtain derivative nationality. As the case was not a class-action lawsuit, it did not impact others in similar situations; however, the 1993 ruling in &quot;Wauchope v. United States Department of State&quot; (985 F.2d 1407, 9th Cir. 1993) by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declared section 1993, which denied a woman&#x27;s ability to transmit nationality to her children born before 1934, unconstitutional. In the case &quot;Miller v. Albright&quot; (523 U.S. 420 1998), the court upheld discriminatory regulations set out in Title in the treatment of women and men passing their nationality to illegitimate children. Justice John Paul Stevens&#x27; opinion in the case was that men do not establish a legal tie to a child except by choice; whereas, a woman&#x27;s legal tie is established by biology. In essence, a woman&#x27;s tie with her child is legal when birth occurs and cannot be severed without legally terminating her parental rights, but a man can choose to walk away or establish a tie. The ruling meant that mothers were able to pass on their nationality at the birth of an illegitimate child born abroad, if the mother had lived for a continuous period of one year prior to the child&#x27;s birth in the United States or a U.S. territory. For an unmarried man to pass nationality to an illegitimate child born abroad, before the child&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, a blood relationship must be proved in court, the child must be recognized and legitimized, and the father&#x27;s nationality at the time of birth must be confirmed. On the basis of &quot;Clark v. Jeter&quot; (486 U.S. 456, 1988), no similar requirement applies for a married man. However, for both married men and unmarried men, the statute &quot;required the U.S.-born parent to have ten years&#x27; physical presence in the United States prior to the child&#x27;s birth, &#x27;at least five of which were after attaining&#x27; age 14&quot;. In 2001, the Supreme Court again upheld the unequal regulations in the case of &quot;Nguyen v. INS&quot; (533 U.S. 53 2001) confirming that in the case of nationality, the inequality is present, which serves governmental objectives, to establish both a biological tie and a customary relationship between the child and parent.

===U.S. outlying territorial history===

The Territorial Clause of the Constitution gave Congress authority to regulate on behalf of United States territories and possessions. Using that power, Congress made distinctions for those territories which were to be incorporated eventually as states, and those that were not on a path of statehood. Because of this authority, Congress has determined when inhabitants can become nationals and what their status is at any given time. Prior to 1898, all persons born in U.S. possessions were treated as having been born in the United States, and upon acquisition, provisions were made for collective naturalization. After that date, possessions have been selectively judged to foreign localities and not subject to the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because of that determination, all persons in the U.S. outlying possessions were considered U.S. nationals, non-citizens, until Congress chose to convey full rights of citizenship. This included inhabitants of American Samoa, Guam, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Non-citizen nationals do not have full protection of their rights, though they may reside in the United States and gain entry without a visa. Likewise, territorial citizens do not have the ability for full participation in national politics.

In a series of Acts, the United States conveyed nationality upon outlying territories not destined for statehood. Inhabitants became neither aliens, eligible for naturalization, nor citizens with full rights. In 1900, legislation defined inhabitants in Puerto Rico as both citizens of Puerto Rico and U.S. nationals. In 1902, similar legislation to that passed for Puerto Rico came in to force concerning the Philippines. The United States established special rules for people working in the Panama Canal Zone in 1903, under the terms of the Panamanian-U.S. Canal Convention. Under its provisions, the was modified to include language that persons born in the Canal Zone or in Panama itself, on or after February 26, 1904, to a parent who was, or formerly was, a United States national derived U.S. birthright citizenship. In 1906, Congress passed legislation to allow persons born in unincorporated territories to be naturalized, under special provisions.

The Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917, conferred nationality with citizenship rights upon all inhabitants of Puerto Rico, regardless of when their birth occurred in the territory. In 1927, U.S. nationals of the U.S. Virgin Islands were granted citizenship rights. American Samoa became a U.S. territory in 1929 and its inhabitants became non-citizen nationals. Since passage of the Nationality Act of 1940, non-citizen nationals may transmit their non-citizen U.S. nationality to children born abroad. The Philippine Independence Act became effective in 1946, and thereafter, Filipinos did not have U.S. nationality. The residents of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands came under U.S. jurisdiction in 1947, pursuant to an arrangement with the United Nations, but it was not included as a territory at that time. U.S. nationals of Guam, by the Organic Act of 1950, were conferred the rights of citizenship. In 1976, the Trust Territories became the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, were admitted as a territory, and inhabitants were conferred U.S. nationality with the rights of citizens. Co-administration of Panama and the Canal Zone commenced on October 1, 1979, and thereafter, U.S. nationality could not be acquired.

==Current scheme==
===Acquisition of nationality===

There are various ways a person can acquire United States nationality, either at birth by naturalization or through court decisions and treaties.

====Birth within the United States====

Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot; The language has been codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, section 301(a). Regardless of the status of the parent, unless they are in the employ of a foreign government, birth within the territory confers nationality. The Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled whether children born in the United States to unauthorized migrants present in the country are birthright nationals, but it is generally presumed they are. Birth certificates from U.S. jurisdictions are typically acceptable proof of nationality.

====Through birth abroad to United States citizens====

For children born abroad, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad may be requested to confirm entitlement as a national. Section 301(c) of the Nationality Act of 1952 extends automatic nationality at birth to children born abroad to two parents who are U.S. nationals, as long as one of the parents resided for any length of time in the United States or its possessions. Section 301(g) establishes that to attain automatic nationality for a child born abroad to a citizen and a foreign national, residency in the United States or its possessions is also required. Time served as active military service was considered equivalent to residence in the U.S. For children with one national parent, requirements vary, depending on when they were born, and whether the parents were married.

=====Legitimate children=====
Automatic nationality is extended based upon the law applicable at the time of the child&#x27;s birth:

*If a birth abroad occurred after May 24, 1934, but prior to December 23, 1952, the U.S. national parent must have resided in the United States or its possessions for ten years, with five of them after the age of fourteen.
*If a birth abroad occurred after December 24, 1952, but prior to November 13, 1986, the U.S. national parent must have been the legal and genetic or gestational parent, and have resided in the United States or its possessions for ten years, with five of them after the age of fourteen.
*If the birth occurred on or after November 14, 1986, the U.S. national must have resided in the United States for five years, two of them after the age of fourteen, previous to the birth of the child.

=====Illegitimate children=====
Automatic nationality is extended based upon the law applicable at the time of the child&#x27;s birth:

*Effective 90 days after October 14, 1940 (whether born before or after this date), if the birth occurred to a U.S. mother who had at any time resided in the United States or its possessions, or to a U.S. father who had legitimized the child during its minority and who had resided in the United States or its possessions for ten years, with five of them after the age of sixteen, as long as the child resided in the United States for five years prior to the age of majority.
*If the birth occurred between January 13, 1941, and December 23, 1952, to a U.S. mother who had at any time resided in the United States or its possessions, or to a U.S. father who had legitimized the child during its minority and who had resided in the United States or its possessions for ten years, with five of them after the age of sixteen.
*If the child was born between December 24, 1952, and November 13, 1986, to a U.S. mother who had resided in the United States or its possessions for one year, or to a U.S. father who had legitimized the child during its minority and who had resided in the United States or its possessions for ten years, with five of them after the age of fourteen.
*If the child was born between November 14, 1986, and June 11, 2017, to a U.S. mother who had resided in the United States or its possessions for one year, or to a U.S. father who had resided in the United States or its possessions five years before the child&#x27;s birth, with two of them after the age of fourteen. In 2017, in a unanimous decision in the case of &quot;Sessions v. Morales-Santana&quot; (137 S. Ct. 1678, 2017), the Supreme Court struck down the unequal gender-based residence requirement for unmarried fathers to pass on nationality to their children born abroad, ruling that the equal but longer term of five years residency should apply to both fathers and mothers until Congress amended the law. In cases where both the mother and father are U.S. citizens, either the pre- or post-Sessions v. Morales-Santana physical presence requirements may apply to U.S. mothers, as the Supreme Court case did not address this specific situation, which falls under a different section of the law. For any child born after November 14, 1986 to a non-US citizen mother and a US citizen the father, the father has to 1) agree to financially support the child, and before the child reaches 18 years of age 2.A) prove in court a biological relationship, or 2.B) formally legitimize the child, or 2.C) officially confirm in a signed and sworn statement the paternity of the child.&quot;.

====Adoptions====
Prior to 2000, adoptees had to be naturalized and could be subject to deportation in later life for various offenses. Adopted children born on or before February 26, 1983, are subject to the law in effect at the time they were adopted. With passage of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, effective for children under eighteen or born on or after February 27, 2001, foreign adoptees of U.S. nationals, brought to the United States by a legal custodial parent in their minority, automatically derive nationality upon legal entry to the country and finalization of the adoption process.

====Birth in outlying possessions====

For people born in U.S. territories or possessions, nationality hinges upon whether they were born prior to the area being covered by U.S. sovereignty, during a period of U.S. sovereignty, or after U.S. sovereignty was terminated. Separate sections of the Nationality Act of 1952 handle territories that the United States has acquired over time, such as Alaska and Hawaii , both incorporated, and unincorporated Puerto Rico , the U.S. Virgin Islands , and Guam . Each of these sections confer nationality on persons living in these territories as of a certain date, and usually confer native-born status on persons born in incorporated territories after that date. Specified effective dates in the territories include April 11, 1899, for Guam and Puerto Rico; January 17, 1917, for the U.S. Virgin Islands; and November 4, 1986, for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Since passage of the Nationality Act of 1952, people born in these territories acquire nationality at birth.

Congress has conferred birthright citizenship, through legislation, to persons born in all inhabited territories except American Samoa and Swains Island, who are granted the status of non-citizen-nationals. A December 12, 2019, ruling by U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down the special status of American Samoans as non-citizen nationals as unconstitutional, holding that &quot;any State Department policy that provides that the citizenship provisions of the Constitution do not apply to persons born in American Samoa violates the 14th Amendment.&quot; Government attorneys had argued that &quot;Such a novel holding would be contrary to the decisions of every court of appeals to have considered the question, inconsistent with over a century of historical practice by all three branches of the United States government, and conflict with the strong objection of the local government of American Samoa.&quot; Waddoups stayed his ruling on December 13 pending appellate review, so it did not take immediate effect. On June 15, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the ruling.

====Naturalization====

A person who was not born a United States national may acquire U.S. nationality through a process known as naturalization.

=====Eligibility for naturalization=====

To become naturalized in the United States, an applicant must be at least eighteen years of age at the time of filing, a legal permanent resident of the United States, and have had a status of a legal permanent resident in the United States for five years before applying. A minimum physical presence in the territory for two and a half years is required, and absences of over six months reset the time frame. Persons married to and living with a U.S. national are eligible for a reduced residency period of three years with half of it requiring physical presence. For the period immediately preceding application, persons must have three months residence established in the jurisdiction in which they are filing and must remain continuously in residence until completion of the granting of nationality. Non-citizen nationals of U.S. possessions are eligible for naturalization upon establishing residency in a state. The territory of the United States, for the purposes of determining a person&#x27;s period of residence, includes the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, specifically excluding residence in American Samoa, except for American Samoans seeking naturalization.

Some exemptions from permanent residency exist for certain qualifying naturalization applicants. For example, since 1940, an immigrant who honorably served in the U.S. military during a designated period of hostility may naturalize without having first been a permanent resident. During peace time, a foreigner&#x27;s honorable military service reduces the residency requirement to one year. A legal but not permanent immigrant who successfully completed the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest program may naturalize without first having been a permanent resident. Similarly, an immigrant who has made extraordinary contributions, such as scientists or Olympic athletes, can be exempted from residency as well as the physical presence requirement and prohibitions for support of totalitarianism and or communism.

The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provided that a minor child born abroad to a U.S.-national parent who had not satisfied the residency requirements for nationality at birth could qualify for special naturalization. In lieu of the parent, a child may also qualify under this process if the child&#x27;s grandparent has satisfied the five-year residency in the United States with two of those years occurring after the child reached the age of 14. Eligible children are not required to meet any other requirements for naturalization.

=====Process for naturalization=====

Applicants must apply for naturalization with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and pay requisite fees. They must demonstrate good moral character, evidenced by a lack of a criminal history, and must pass a test on United States history and civics. The questions are publicly available on the web and require the applicant to answer ten out of one hundred possible questions. Most applicants must also have a working knowledge of the English language, demonstrated by testing their basic ability in reading and writing, rather than fluency. Long-term permanent residents are exempt from the language test. For example, a person who is over age fifty with twenty years of residency or over fifty-five with fifteen years of residency can opt to take the civics test in their original language. Persons over age sixty-five with twenty years residency may be given a shorter list of questions and those with physical or mental disadvantages are exempt from either the language or civics examinations. Granting of nationality is contingent upon taking an Oath of Allegiance; however since 2000 an exception has been made for people with diminished physical or mental capacity.

===Loss of nationality===
The United States has a lengthy history of involuntary expatriation (loss of nationality). From 1907, naturalized persons who returned to their country of origin for two or more years could be expatriated, as could native-born nationals who moved abroad and took allegiance to another nation. Married women were automatically expatriated upon marriage to foreign men or men who were unable to qualify for naturalization. From 1940, reasons for involuntary termination of nationality included service to a foreign government or in foreign armed forces, voting in a foreign election, military desertion, treason, or evidence of dual nationality, except for possession of a passport. The Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of expatriation was made clear in &quot;Mackenzie v. Hare&quot; in 1915 with the ruling that Ethel Mackenzie&#x27;s conduct, choosing to marry a non-national, was a voluntary acceptance to be denationalized. In the case of &quot;Savorgnan v. United States&quot; in 1950, the Court ruled that not knowing the consequences of one&#x27;s actions was equally voluntary expatriation. The 1958 decision in &quot;Perez v. Brownell&quot;, which upheld denaturalization for foreign voting, marked a turning point, and the decision was reversed in 1967 in the ruling for &quot;Afroyim v. Rusk&quot;, 387 U.S. 253, which found that for a person&#x27;s voluntary action to initiate a loss of nationality, an inference of abandonment by the action must have been present. By 1978, the decision in &quot;Vance v. Terrazas&quot; made it clear that a specific intent to expatriate must exist to lose nationality.

In 1986, was amended based on these court decisions to affirm that the intention to relinquish nationality must exist when performing a voluntary act for loss of nationality to occur. The State Department issued a partial list of actions such as paying taxes or recording a will in the United States, which would indicate intent to retain a national identity, or using a foreign passport when entering the United States or registering with a foreign political party, which might indicate an intent to relinquish nationality, but advised each case was to be reviewed in context. Nationals were advised to write a statement advising that their actions were not an intent to give up their nationality and file it with an embassy or consulate official. In 1990, Section 1481 was revised again, to reflect a new policy of the State Department to presume that an individual did not intend to give up nationality, if the person performed a potentially expatriating act. Based on a consular memorandum, this meant that, for example, acquisition of nationality in another nation which included a routine declaration of allegiance, or accepting foreign employment in a non-policy position of another nation, should result in the assumption that the person had no intention of relinquishing their nationality through their actions. From that time, the United States effectively has allowed nationals to acquire new nationality while remaining a U.S. national, thereby holding multiple nationalities, and has ceased seeking records of newly nationalized persons abroad to evaluate their potential denationalization.

Removing these items from the potential means of forfeiting U.S. nationality, the Nationality Act retained as possible causes of denaturalization, treason, sedition, or conspiring against the United States; employment as an official with policy-making authority of a foreign government; and voluntary renunciation. Fraud, committed in conjunction with an application for naturalization can also make nationality voidable. Typically, prominent former Nazi officers who acquired U.S. nationality have had it revoked if the Office of Special Investigations has been able to prove that the naturalization was obtained by concealing their involvement in war crimes committed during World War II. They cannot be tried for crimes committed elsewhere, thus are denaturalized for immigration violations, and once they become aliens, ordered deported.

The process of denaturalization is a legal procedure which results in nullifying nationality. Based upon the 1943 Supreme Court decision of &quot;Schneiderman v. United States&quot;, clear and convincing evidence must be evaluated in processing a denaturalization action. United States Attorneys for the district in which a defendant resides bring suit in the jurisdiction&#x27;s Federal District Court. Juries are typically not present and the defendant may be compelled to testify. Failure to testify may result in a presumption of guilt, though defendants can plead against self-incrimination. The standard of proof is not reasonable doubt, but rather clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence. Decisions may be appealed in federal appellate courts and the Supreme Court. Once the legal process has concluded, the Department of State issues a Certificate of Loss of Nationality.

Renunciation of nationality, or legal expatriation, includes the voluntary relinquishment of a national identity and all rights and privileges associated with it. It is accomplished by making a formal declaration, which is sworn before a designated authority in the United States during a time of war, or abroad at any time to a consular officer. Evidence which clearly establishes the intent to expatriate must be approved and if there is doubt, such as in the case where a declarant would become stateless, the Department of State may be reluctant to accept the declaration. After an interview and counseling on the consequences of renunciation, if the applicant wishes to proceed, a fee is paid, the declaration is made, and a renunciation ceremony, in which the applicant signs a &quot;Statement of Understanding&quot; and takes the &quot;Oath of Renunciation&quot;, is held.

People giving up U.S. nationality may be subject to an expatriation tax. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people determined to be giving up their nationality for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation were subject to ten years of continued taxation on their U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-nationals from taking advantage of special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United States. Since 2008, these provisions no longer apply; instead, ex-citizens who meet certain asset or tax liability thresholds pay a capital gains tax on a deemed sale of their U.S. and non-U.S. assets, including retirement accounts, regardless of their reasons for giving up citizenship. The Reed Amendment, a 1996 law, bars former nationals as inadmissible to the United States if the Attorney General finds that they renounced citizenship for purposes of avoiding taxes; however, it has never been enforced. Proposals such as the Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act to rewrite the Reed Amendment and make it enforceable failed in committee in both 2012 and 2013.

===Dual nationality===
The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Kawakita v. United States&quot;, 343 U.S. 717 (1952) that dual nationality is a long-recognized status in the law and that &quot;a person may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and be subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact he asserts the rights of one nationality does not, without more, mean that he renounces the other&quot;. In &quot;Schneider v. Rusk&quot;, 377 U.S. 163 (1964), it found that persons who have been naturalized in the United States have the right to return to their native countries and to resume a former nationality while remaining a U.S. national. This applies even if they never return to the United States. Since 1990, the State Department has allowed multiple nationalities. Official policy is one of recognition that such a status exists, but the U.S. government does not endorse a policy of having multiple nationalities, though it is permitted. Dual nationality may run counter to expectations of government agencies in matters of security clearance or access to classified information.

<text>By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light is an HBO original movie, first aired in 1990. It is based on the 1983 novel &quot;Trinity&#x27;s Child&quot;, written by William Prochnau.
==Plot==
In 1991, dissident officials in the Soviet Union launch a nuclear missile at Donetsk from a site in NATO member Turkey. Soviet automated defense systems, believing that a NATO attack is in progress, execute a measured launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the United States. After Donetsk is destroyed, Strategic Air Command (SAC) scrambles its forces and SAC Commander General Renning urges the President to authorize a large-scale counterattack. The Soviet leader explains the dissidents&#x27; actions to the President. He asks the United States to stand down, citing the two nations&#x27; improving relations, but is willing to accept a US counterstrike comparable to the Soviet strike, costing each side six to nine million people. If the US launches an all-out attack, however, the Soviets will respond in kind.

As the President argues with General Renning, it is reported that the Soviets have launched a second attack. The president reluctantly authorizes a multi-part all-out attack, with US ICBMs launched immediately, then submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a few hours, coincident with the arrival of US Air Force bombers over the Soviet Union. General Renning issues the orders just before the first wave of Soviet missiles hits SAC headquarters and passes command of SAC to &quot;Alice,&quot; the codename of an Air Force general in command of Looking Glass, a flying command aircraft for the US Air Force. The president takes off in Marine One and learns the second Soviet attack was directed at China, since it had launched its own missiles against the Soviets. Realizing his mistake, the president tries to cancel the retaliation order, but before he can do this a nearby nuclear detonation forces down his helicopter.

A B-52 bomber, commanded by Major Cassidy and his co-pilot Captain Moreau, takes off with callsign &quot;Polar Bear 1&quot; moments before Fairchild Air Force Base is destroyed. The crewmen are shaken by the unfolding events; while fighting off Russian interceptors a nuclear flash partially blinds Moreau and the ensuing shock wave kills another crew member. The bomber proceeds into eastern Russia.

An American admiral, codenamed &quot;Harpoon,&quot; is in command of Nightwatch, a presidential flying command platform. With the president presumed dead, they swear in the Secretary of the Interior as president, codenamed &quot;Condor&quot;. Harpoon briefs Condor regarding the Soviet leader&#x27;s message, the mistake regarding China, and the damage already done by the initial retaliation. Colonel Fargo, a hawkish advisor on Nightwatch, advises Condor to continue American strikes. Condor agrees with Fargo&#x27;s plan for a submarine missile and bomber attack, overruling Harpoon&#x27;s plea to negotiate a ceasefire, and orders Alice to execute the remainder of the attack plan. Cassidy and Moreau react emotionally to these orders and convince their crew to abort the mission. Crewman Tyler, despondent over the loss of his family at Fairchild, kills himself by ejecting without a parachute, killing the entire crew except the two pilots.

The President is discovered badly injured at the crash site of Marine One and is taken to a FEMA emergency shelter where he learns of Condor&#x27;s orders. He contacts the Soviet president and they agree to a one-hour standoff. Aboard Looking Glass, Alice notices that Polar Bear 1 has abandoned its attack and a Soviet squadron has apparently also turned back in response. Alice begs Condor to recall the rest of the US bombers so a ceasefire can be arranged. Condor instead orders Alice to send bombers to shoot down Polar Bear 1. Alice hesitates and Fargo informs Condor that they can send the command from Nightwatch. Condor cuts off communication with Looking Glass.

The President contacts Alice, and Looking Glass agrees to recall the bombers but lacks the authority to call off the submarine attack. Two
US Navy carrier-based fighters intercept Polar Bear 1 over the Pacific Ocean to shoot it down, but when their aircraft carrier is sunk, they call off their attack and instead wish Polar Bear 1 good luck. The President finally connects with Condor. Fearing he is an impersonator, Condor orders the Nightwatch staff to contact the submarines and transmit launch orders. Alice and the Looking Glass staff decide to ram their plane into Nightwatch before Condor can send out launch orders, and the Nightwatch pilots sacrifice themselves by turning their aircraft into the path of Looking Glass. The President successfully issues a stand-down message to American forces as Cassidy and Moreau fly towards a sunrise, uncertain of whether their fuel will last long enough to reach land, but relieved that the world has a future now.

==Cast==
* Powers Boothe as Major Cassidy, USAF – pilot of the B-52 bomber &quot;Polar Bear 1&quot;
* Rebecca De Mornay as Captain Moreau, USAF – copilot of &quot;Polar Bear 1&quot; 
* James Earl Jones as USAF General Charlie in command of the EC-135 &quot;Looking Glass&quot; – callsign &quot;Alice&quot; 
* Martin Landau as President of the United States
* Darren McGavin as US Secretary of the Interior on the Boeing E-4 NEACP aircraft – callsign &quot;Condor&quot; 
* Rip Torn as Colonel Fargo, USA – Army military advisor in the E-4
* Jeffrey DeMunn as USN Admiral aboard the E-4 – callsign &quot;Harpoon&quot;
* Peter MacNicol as Lieutenant Commander Tom Sedgwick, USN – President&#x27;s Emergency War Orders officer
* Nicolas Coster as General Clay Renning, USAF, at SAC headquarters – callsign &quot;Icarus&quot;

* Richard Speight Jr. as a USAF guard

==Production==
Principal photography took place from August 7 to late September 1989. The use of military hardware such as the B-52 bomber and Boeing E-4 enabled a realistic account of the Strategic Air Command in action.

===Differences from the source material===
There are two major differences between the plot of the novel and the film, the first being that the crisis in the novel is started by a deliberate Soviet attack to counter the US military buildup with which they are unable to compete. The other major difference in the film is the romantic subplot between Moreau and Cassidy, which is absent in the book; the characters there actually ridicule the idea of such a relationship between them.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews of &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot; centered on the confrontation by nuclear powers and gave it accolades. &quot;There never has been a made-for-cable movie as sleek and efficient as &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;. Fast-moving, complex, and only occasionally a bit hokey, it&#x27;s by far the best original movie project HBO has overseen.&quot; &quot;Boasting high production values, okay special effects, and a surprisingly top-notch cast... a thrilling drama that is your better-than-average made-for-TV movie.&quot; More recent reviews were similar: &quot;Probably the end of the line for Cold War confrontation on this scale, but compelling drama nonetheless.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
In 1990, James Earl Jones was nominated for an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special&quot; and Matte World Digital won for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Special Visual Effects&quot;.

In addition, Martin Landau was nominated for the 1991 Cable Ace award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries, but lost to his co-star from this film, James Earl Jones who won for &quot;Heat Wave&quot;.

&quot;Note: There is no standard way to measure the total length of a bridge. Some bridges are measured from the beginning of the entrance ramp to the end of the exit ramp. Some are measured from shoreline to shoreline. Yet others use the length of the total construction involved in building the bridge. Since there is no standard, no ranking of a bridge should be assumed because of its position in the list. Additionally, numbers are merely estimates and measures in U.S. customary units (feet) may be imprecise due to conversion rounding.&quot;

<doc id="993875" wikidata="Q3794953" url="?curid=993875" title="Robin's Nest (TV series)">
<text>Robin&#x27;s Nest is a British sitcom produced by Thames Television that aired on the ITV network for six series from 11 January 1977 to 31 March 1981. Richard O&#x27;Sullivan reprised the role of Robin Tripp, a lead character from the sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot;, which had ended on 7 April 1976. The series costars Tessa Wyatt as Robin&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife Vicky, and Tony Britton as her father. O&#x27;Sullivan and Wyatt were a romantic couple in real life at the time and had a son together.

==Premise==
Robin Tripp and Vicky Nicholls are an unmarried couple who share a flat over an abandoned Chinese takeaway owned by Vicky&#x27;s father James. Vicky refuses to wed Robin despite his continuous proposals, as she is averse to marriage after witnessing her parents&#x27; contentious marriage and divorce. Robin opens a French bistro called Robin&#x27;s Nest in the abandoned space, with James as his business partner and landlord. James, who disapproves of Robin and his living arrangement with Vicky, frequently interferes with the operation of the restaurant. James also frequently clashes with his ex-wife Marion. Robin employs a clumsy one-armed dishwasher called Albert Riddle. Robin and Vicky eventually marry, and Vicky gives birth to a set of twins. At the end of the last episode, Vicky tells Robin that she is pregnant again.

== Cast ==

* Richard O&#x27;Sullivan as Robin Tripp
* Tessa Wyatt as Victoria (Vicky) Nicholls
* Tony Britton as James Nicholls
* David Kelly as Albert Riddle
* Peggy Aitchison as Gertrude
* Honor Blackman/Barbara Murray as Marion Nicholls

== Production ==
Creators and writers Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer gained special permission from the Independent Broadcasting Authority, the regulatory body for television in Britain, to portray an unmarried couple living together, especially because of scenes in which Robin and Vicky are undressed in bed together.

==Theme music==
The show&#x27;s star Richard O&#x27;Sullivan wrote the theme music, which was arranged and performed by Brian Bennett of the Shadows.

==Foreign adaptations==
The show was adapted in the United States as &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, which had been based on &quot;Man About the House&quot;, but it was unsuccessful, lasting for only one season.

In 2004, a Polish version was created under the title &quot;Dziupla Cezara&quot;.

<doc id="993879" wikidata="Q836057" url="?curid=993879" title="Order of the Holy Sepulchre">
<text>The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (, OESSH), also called the Order of the Holy Sepulchre or Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, is a Catholic order of knighthood under the protection of the Holy See. The Pope is the sovereign of the order. The order creates canons as well as knights, with the primary mission to &quot;support the Christian presence in the Holy Land&quot;. It is an internationally recognised order of chivalry. The order today is estimated to have some 30,000 knights and dames in 60 lieutenancies around the world. The Cardinal Grand Master has been Fernando Filoni since 2019, and the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem is &quot;ex officio&quot; the Order&#x27;s Grand Prior. Its headquarters are situated at the Palazzo Della Rovere and its official church in Sant&#x27;Onofrio al Gianicolo, both in Rome, close to Vatican City. In 1994, Pope John Paul II declared the Virgin Mary as the order&#x27;s patron saint under the title &quot;Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Palestine&quot;.

==Name==
The name of the knights and order varied over the centuries, including and &quot;The Sacred and Military Order of the Holy Sepulchre&quot;. The current name was determined on 27 July 1931 as the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (with &quot;of Jerusalem&quot; as honorary suffix) by decree of the Sacred Congregation of Ceremonies of the Holy See. The term &quot;equestrian&quot; in this context is consistent with its use for orders of knighthood of the Holy See, referring to the chivalric and knightly nature of order—by sovereign prerogative conferring knighthood on recipients—derived from the equestrians (), a social class in Ancient Rome.

==History==

The history of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem runs common and parallel to that of the religious Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre, the order continuing after the Canons Regular ceased to exist at the end of the 15th century (except for their female counterpart, the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre).

===Background===
Pilgrimages to the Holy Land were a common, if hazardous, practice from shortly after the crucifixion of Jesus to throughout the Middle Ages. Numerous detailed commentaries have survived as evidence of this early Christian devotion. While there were many places the pious visited during their travels, the one most cherished was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, first constructed by Constantine the Great in the 4th century AD.

During the era of the Islamic expansion, Emperor Charlemagne (–814) sent two embassies to the caliph of Baghdad, asking Frankish protectorate over the Holy Land. An epic recounts his legendary adventures in the Mediterranean and pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

By virtue of its defining characteristic of subinfeudation, in feudalism it was common practice for knights commanders to confer knighthoods upon their finest soldiers, who in turn had the right to confer knighthood on others upon attaining command. Tradition maintains, that long before the Crusades, a form of knighthood was bestowed upon worthy men at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In any case, during the 11th century, prior to the Crusades, the &quot;&quot; were established to protect Christians and Christian premises in the Occident.

Persecution of Christians in the Holy Land intensified and relations with Christian rulers were further strained when Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009.

===Crusades===

The crusades coincided with a renewed concern in Europe for the holy places, with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as one of the most important places. According to an undocumented tradition, Girolamo Gabrielli of the Italian Gabrielli family, who was the leader of 1000 knights from Gubbio, Umbria, during the First Crusade, was the first crusader to enter the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after Jerusalem was seized in 1099.

===Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1291)===

After the capture of Jerusalem at the end of the First Crusade in 1099, the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre were established to take care of the church. The men in charge of securing its defence and its community of canons were called . Together, the canons and the milites formed part of the structure of which evolved into the modern Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. Baldwin I, the first king of Jerusalem, laid the foundations of the kingdom and established its main institutions on the French pattern as a centralised feudal state. He also drew up the first constitution of the order in 1103, modelled on the chapter of canons that he founded in Antwerp prior to his departure, under which the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem (who had supplanted the Greek Orthodox patriarch) appointed knights in Jerusalem at the direct service of the crown, similar to the organisation of third orders. Adopting the rule of Saint Augustine, with recognition in 1113 by Papal Bull of Pope Paschal II, with the attached, it is considered among the oldest of the chivalric orders. Indications suggest that Hugues de Payens (c. 1070–1136) was among the Milites Sancti Sepulcri during his second time in Jerusalem in 1114–16, before being appointed &quot;Magister Militum Templi&quot;, establishing the Knights Templar.

Between –, Gerard (), the Prior of the Holy Sepulchre, along with Patriarch Warmund of Jerusalem, wrote a significant letter to Diego Gelmírez, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela citing crop failures and being threatened by their enemies; they requested food, money, and military aid in order to maintain the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Gerard consequently participated among others in the Council of Nablus, 16 January 1120. In it, Canons 20–21 deal with clerics. Canon 20 says a cleric should not be held guilty if he takes up arms in self-defense, but he cannot take up arms for any other reason nor can he act like a knight. This was an important concern for the crusader states; clerics were generally forbidden from participating in warfare in European law, but the crusaders needed all the manpower they could find and, only one year before, Antioch had been defended by the Latin patriarch of Antioch following the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, one of the calamities referred to in the introduction to the canons. Canon 21 says that a monk or canon regular who apostatizes should either return to his order or go into exile.

In 1121, Pope Callixtus II issued a bull formally erecting the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre with specific responsibilities to defend the Church Universal, protect the City of Jerusalem, guard the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre and pilgrims, and fight in the defence of Christianity.

In total, as a result of these military needs, five major chivalric communities were established in the Kingdom of Jerusalem between the late 11th century and the early 12th century: the Knights Hospitaller (Order of Saint John) (circa 1099), the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre (circa 1099), the Knights Templar (circa 1118), the Knights of Saint Lazarus (1123), and the Knights of the Hospital of Saint Mary of Jerusalem (Teutonic Knights) (1190).

Today,
* the Order of Knights Templar no longer exists (other than its successor in Portugal – the Order of Christ),
* the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus is recognised as the successor to the medieval Order of Saint Lazarus,
* the successor to the Teutonic Order is a purely religious order of the Catholic Church,
* but both the Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre continue as chivalric orders recognised by the Holy See.

The , establishing in 1123 an alliance of the Kingdom of Jerusalem with the Republic of Venice, was later signed by Patriarch Warmund and Prior Gerard of the Holy Sepulchre, along with Archbishop Ehremar of Caesarea, Bishop Bernard of Nazareth, Bishop Aschetinus of Bethlehem, Bishop Roger of Bishop of Lydda, Guildin the Abbot of St. Mary of Josaphat, Prior Aicard of the Templum Domini, Prior Arnold of Mount Zion, William Buris, and Chancellor Pagan. Aside from William and Pagan, no secular authorities witnessed the treaty, perhaps indicating that the allied Venetians considered Jerusalem a papal fief.

Meanwhile, beyond the Holy Land, in Spain, during the Reconquista, military orders built their own monasteries which also served as fortresses of defence, though otherwise the houses followed monastic premises. A typical example of this type of monastery is the Calatrava la Nueva, headquarters of the Order of Calatrava, founded by the Abbot of Fitero, Raymond, at the behest of King Sancho III of Castile, to protect the area restored to the Islamic rulers. Other orders such as the Order of Santiago, Knight Templars and the Holy Sepulchre devoted much of their efforts to protect and care for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago. Furthermore, at the Siege of Bayonne in October 1131, three years before his death, King Alfonso I of Aragon, having no children, bequeathed his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in the Holy Land and politically largely independent – the Knights Templars, the Knights Hospitallers and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre – whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso that effectively undid his life&#x27;s work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso&#x27;s attempt to neutralize the papacy&#x27;s interest in a disputed succession – Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 – and to fend off his stepson, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.

In 15 July 1149 in the Holy Land, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was consecrated after reconstruction.
Crusade vows meant that even if a person wasn&#x27;t able to make the journey to Holy Sepulchre himself, sometimes his cloak was taken there, as was the case with King Henry the Young of England (1155–1183). Robert the Bruce and James Douglas, Lord of Douglas even asked to have their hearts taken to the Holy Sepulchre after death.

Besides pilgrimages and the creation of knights, even coronations took place at the Holy Sepulchre. Shortly before his death in 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew, Baldwin V, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The official arrival of the Franciscan Friars Minor in Syria dates from the papal bull addressed by Pope Gregory IX to the clergy of the Holy Land in 1230, charging them to welcome the Friars Minor, and to allow them to preach to the faithful and hold oratories and cemeteries of their own. In the ten years&#x27; truce of 1229 concluded between King Frederick of Sicily and the Sultan Al-Kamil, the Franciscans were permitted to enter Jerusalem, but they were also the first victims of the violent invasion of the Khwarezmians in 1244.

===Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land (1291–1489)===

The ultimate fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to the Muslims in 1291 did not suspend pilgrimages to the tomb of Christ or the custom of receiving knighthood there, and when the Custody of the Holy Land was entrusted to the Franciscan Order they continued this pious custom and gave the order its first grand master after the death of the last king of Jerusalem.

The friars quickly resumed possession of their convent of Mount Zion at Jerusalem. The Turks tolerated the veneration paid to the tomb of Christ and derived revenue from the taxes levied upon pilgrims. In 1342, in his bull , Pope Clement VI officially committed the care of the Holy Land to the Franciscans; only the restoration of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem by Pius IX in 1847 superseded the Franciscans.

With the emergence of the code of conduct of chivalry during the Middle Ages, conferring of knighthoods was pursued also at the Holy Sepulchre. From the period 1291 to 1847, the Franciscan Custodian of Mount Sion was the only authority representing the Holy See in the Holy Land.

Documented from 1335, the Franciscan Custody enrolled applicants as Knights of the Holy Sepulchre in ceremonies frequently mentioned in the itineraries of pilgrims. Those pilgrims deemed worthy received the honour in a solemn ceremony of ancient chivalry. However, in the ceremonial of reception at the time, the role of the clergy was limited to the , the dubbing with the sword being reserved to a professional knight, since the carrying of the sword was incompatible with the sacerdotal character, and reserved to previous knights.
In 1346, King Valdemar IV of Denmark went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and was made a knight of the Holy Sepulchre. This increased the prestige of Valdemar, who had difficulty in effectively ruling over his kingdom. Saint Bridget of Sweden, one of the future patron saints of Europe, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1371–1373 along with her sons. The oldest, Karl, died prior in Naples, but Birger Ulfsson became a knight of the Holy Sepulchre, followed by Hugo von Montfort (1395) and more to come.

Duke Albert IV of Austria was made a knight in 1400, followed by his brother Ernest (1414) and by the Kalmar ruler Eric of Pomerania (1420&#x27;s) and later by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III (1436), accompanied by Georg von Ehingen and numerous other knighted nobles; later were Count Otto II of Mosbach-Neumarkt (1460), Landgrave William III of Thuringia (1461) and Heinrich Reuß von Plauen (1461) who was also grand master of the Teutonic Order.
The significance of the pilgrimages is indicated by various commemorations of the knights. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Görlitz in Saxony was built by Georg Emmerich, who was knighted in 1465. Of the medieval Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, notably, Emmerich, although a mayor and a wealthy merchant, was neither a monarch nor a nobleman. Eberhard I of Württemberg, knighted together with Christoph I of Baden in 1468, chose a palm as his personal symbol, including in the crest (heraldry) of his coat of arms. Others built church buildings in their hometowns, such as the chapel in Pratteln, Switzerland, by Hans Bernhard von Eptingen (knighted 1460), and Jeruzalemkerk in Bruges, Belgium, built by Anselm Adornes (knighted 1470). The latter still stands to this day, modelled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and today adorned with the heraldry of the order.

Some property of the Knights in Italy was transferred to the newly established Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1459, but the merger proved a failure. The Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem was suppressed almost as soon as it was founded and those orders whose goods the pope had transmitted to it were re-established.

The accolades continued: Counts Enno I and Edzard I of East Frisia (1489), followed by Elector Frederick III of Saxony (1493) who was also recipient of the papal honour of the Golden Rose, together with Christoph the Strong of Bavaria, then Frederick II of Legnica (1507), and others.

====Franciscan Grand Magistry====
From 1480 to 1495, John of Prussia, a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, acted as Steward for the Convent and regularly discharged the act of accolade. It was a frequent occurrence that a foreign Knight present among the crowds of pilgrims would assist at this ceremony. However, without other assistance, it was the Superior who had to act instead of a Knight, although such a course was deemed irregular. Around this time, the Superior of the Convent assumed the title of Grand Master of the Knights, a title acknowledged by various pontifical diplomas.

When the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre were suppressed in 1489, Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre into the Knights Hospitaller, but this was not successful. The Franciscan province of the Holy Land continued to exist, with Acre as its seat. In the territory of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, reinstituted in 1847, the Franciscans still have 24 convents, and 15 parishes.

===Papal Grand Magistry (1496–1847)===
In 1496, Pope Alexander VI restored the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre to independent status, organised as an Order. He decreed that the Knights would no longer be governed by the Custody of the Holy Land, but that the senior post of the Order would henceforth be raised to the rank of Grand Master, reserving this title for himself and his successors.

The prerogative of dubbing Knights of the Holy Sepulchre was repeatedly confirmed by the Holy See; by Pope Leo X on 4 May 1515, by Pope Clement VII in 1527 and by Pope Pius IV on 1 August 1561.

The privileges of the order, recorded by its guardian in 1553 and approved by successive popes, included powers to:
* Legitimise bastards
* Change a name given in baptism
* Pardon prisoners they might meet on the way to the scaffold
* Possess goods belonging to the Church even though they were laymen
* Be exempt from taxes
* Cut a man down from the gallows and to order him to be given a Christian burial
* Wear brocaded silk garments
* Enter a church on horseback
* Fight against the infidel

In France, King Henry IV of France purchased its French possessions and incorporated them into his newly established Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, formally established by Pope Paul V through the bull &quot;Romanus Pontificus&quot; on 16 February 1608 and expanded through &quot;Militantium ordinum&quot; dated 26 February 1608, along with possessions of other orders which apparently were all deemed extinct and abolished, indicating reduced regional activity.

Nonetheless, the dubbing and the privileges enjoyed continued confirmation, by Pope Alexander VII on 3 August 1665, by Pope Benedict XIII on 3 March 1727, and by Pope Benedict XIV (1675–1758) who approved all but the last of the privileges of the order, and also stated that it should enjoy precedence over all orders except the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Pontifical Orders.

Knights of the Holy Sepulchre dubbed during this era include Hieronymus von Dorne (circa 1634) and François-René de Chateaubriand (1806).

===Restoration of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem (1847)===

Pius IX re-established the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 1847, and re-organized the Order of the Holy Sepulchre as the , whereby the grand master of the order was to be the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, and the order ceased to be a pontifical order for a period. Initially, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta opposed the decision and claimed rights to its legacy, probably based on the papal decision of 1489. However, in 1868 it was named (Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem).

Pope Pius X assumed the title of grand master for the papacy again in 1907, but in 1928 this was again relinquished by Pope Pius XI in favour of the patriarch of Jerusalem, and for a time the order again ceased to be a papal order.

In 1932, Pius XI approved a new constitution and permitted investiture in the places of origin and not only in Jerusalem.

===Protection of the Holy See (from 1945)===

In 1945, Pope Pius XII placed the order again under the sovereignty, patronage and protection of the Holy See, and in 1949 he approved a new constitution for the order, which included that the grand master be a cardinal of the Roman Curia, and that the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem be the Grand Prior of the order. In 1962 the Constitution of the Order was again reformed and the order was recognized as a juridical person in canon law.

The current Constitution of the Order was approved by Pope Paul VI in 1977, and it maintains those arrangements. The order&#x27;s status was further enhanced by Pope John Paul II in 1996, when, in addition to its canonical legal personality, it was given civil legal personality in Vatican City State, where it is headquartered. An amendment to the Constitution of the Order was approved by Pope John Paul II simultaneously with the concession of Vatican legal personality for the order.

==Organisation==
The order today remains an order of chivalry and is an association of the faithful with a legal canonical and public personality, constituted by the Holy See under Canon Law 312, paragraph 1:1, represented by 60 lieutenancies in more than 40 countries around the world: 24 in Europe, 15 in the United States and Canada, 5 in Latin America and 6 in Australia and Asia. It is recognised internationally as a legitimate order of knighthood, headquartered in Vatican City State under papal sovereignty and having the protection of the Holy See.

===Purpose and activities===
Its principal mission is to reinforce the practice of Christian life by its members in absolute fidelity to the pope; to sustain and assist the religious, spiritual, charitable and social works and rights of the Catholic Church and the Christians in the Holy Land, particularly of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem which receives some 10 million dollars annually in donations from members of the order. Other activities around the world are connected to their original functions.

Regional activities include participation in local processions and religious ceremonies, such as during Holy Week.

In France, the French Revolution resulted in a ban on conserving relics and all other sacred symbols linked to the monarchy, though pieces judged to be of high artistic quality were exempt. These relics were handed over to the archbishop of Paris in 1804 and are still held in the cathedral treasury of Notre Dame de Paris, cared for by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and the cathedral chapter. On the first Friday of every month at 3:00pm, guarded by the Knights, the Relics of Sainte-Chapelle are exposed for veneration and adoration by the faithful before the cathedral&#x27;s high altar. Every Good Friday, this adoration lasts all day, punctuated by the liturgical offices. An exhibition entitled was mounted at the Louvre in 2001.

===Grand Masters and Grand Magisterium===

In 1496, Pope Alexander VI vested the office of Grand Master in the papacy where it remained until 1949. Since 1949, cardinals have held the office. The incumbent Cardinal Grand Master has been Fernando Filoni since 2019.

The Grand Magisterium also includes:
*Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and Cardinal-Priest of Sant&#x27;Onofrio al Gianicolo, Grand Prior of the Order
*Tommaso Caputo, Prelate of the Territorial Prelature of Pompei, Assessor of the Order
*Count Leonardo Visconti di Modrone, Governor General
*P. Thomas Pogge, Vice-Governor General for North America
*Jean-Pierre Glutz-Ruchti, Vice-Governor General for Europe
*John Secker, Vice-Governor General for Asia and the Pacific region
*Enric Mas, Vice-Governor General for Latin America
*Alfredo Bastianelli, Chancellor of the Order
*Adriano Paccanelli, Master of Ceremonies of the Order
*Severio Petrillo, Treasurer of the Order
*Antonio Franco, Assessor of Honour
*Giuseppe Lazzarotto, Assessor of Honour
The offices of the Grand Magisterium are in the headquarters in Rome.

===Headquarters===
Its headquarters are situated at the Palazzo Della Rovere in Rome, the 15th-century palace of Pope Julius II, immediately adjacent to the Vatican on the Via della Conciliazione. It was given to the order by Pope Pius XII. Its official church is the Sant&#x27;Onofrio al Gianicolo in Rome, also given to the order by Pius XII. In 1307, after the suppression of the Knights Templars, the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre, whose main priory was at San Luca, acquired the complex of San Manno. Francesco della Rovere, the future Pope Sixtus IV, was Arch-Prior there 1460–1471.

==Insignia==
===Heraldry===

By ancient tradition, the order uses the arms attributed to the Kingdom of Jerusalem – a gold Jerusalem Cross on a silver/white background – but enamelled with red, the colour of blood, to signify the five wounds of Christ. Prior use of the symbol is in the 1573 Constitution of the Order.
Conrad Grünenberg already shows a red Jerusalem cross (with the central cross as cross crosslet rather than cross potent) as the emblem of the order in his 1486 travelogue.

Above the shield of the armorial bearings is a sovereign&#x27;s gold helmet upon which are a crown of thorns and a terrestrial globe surmounted by a cross, flanked by two white standards bearing a red Jerusalem cross. The supporters are two angels wearing dalmatic tunics of red, the one on the dexter bearing a crusader flag, and the one on the sinister bearing a pilgrim&#x27;s staff and shell: representing the military/crusading and pilgrim natures of the order.

The motto is &quot;Deus lo Vult&quot; (&quot;God Wills It&quot;). The seal of the order is in the shape of an almond and portrays, within a frame of a crown of thorns, a representation of Christ rising from the Sepulchre.

The Order of the Holy Sepulchre and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta are the only two institutions whose insignia may be displayed in a clerical coat of arms.

===Vestments===

The order has a predominantly white-coloured levée dress court uniform, and a more modern, military-style uniform, both of which are now only occasionally used in some jurisdictions. Pope Pius X ordained that the usual modern choir (i.e. church) dress of knights be the order&#x27;s cape or mantle: a &quot;white cloak with the cross of Jerusalem in red&quot;, as worn by the original knights. Female members wear a black cape with a red Jerusalem cross bordered with gold.

The choir vestments of Canons of the Holy Sepulchre include a black cassock with magenta piping, magenta fascia, and a white mozetta with the red Jerusalem cross.

==Membership==
The order today is estimated to have some 30,000 knights and dames in 60 Lieutenancies around the world, including monarchs, crown princes and their consorts, and heads of state from countries such as Spain, Belgium, Monaco, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.

Membership of the order is by invitation only, to practicing Catholic men and women – laity and clergy – of good character, minimum 25 years of age, who have distinguished themselves by concern for the Christians of the Holy Land. Aspirant members must be recommended by their local bishop with the support of several members of the order, and are required to make a generous donation as a &quot;passage fee&quot;, echoing the ancient practice of crusaders paying their passage to the Holy Land, as well as an annual financial offering for works undertaken in the Holy Land, particularly in the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, throughout their life. There is a provision for the grand master to admit members by &quot;motu proprio&quot; in exceptional circumstances and also for the officers of the Grand Magistery to occasionally recommend candidates to the grand master.

The honour of knighthood and any subsequent promotions are conferred by the Holy See – through diploma sealed and signed by the assessor for general affairs of the Secretariat of State in Rome as well as the cardinal grand master – which approves each person, in the name of and by the authority of the pope. The candidate is then knighted or promoted in a solemn ceremony with a cardinal or major prelate presiding.

Knights and dames of the order may not join, or attend the events of, any other order that is not recognised by the Holy See or by a sovereign state, and must renounce any membership in such organisations before being appointed a knight or dame of the Holy Sepulchre. Knights and dames may be expelled from the order in circumstances where they breach its code of conduct.

===Ranks===
There are several grades of knighthood. These are open to both men and women. While laity may be promoted to any rank, the ranks of the clergy are as follows: cardinals are knights grand cross, bishops are commanders with star, and priests and transitional deacons start with the rank of knight but may be promoted to commander. Permanent deacons are treated the same as the lay knights. Female members may wear chest ribbons rather than neck crosses, and the military trophies in insignia and heraldic additaments are replaced by bows.

Below are shown the official titles of the ranks in English (&quot;Italian, French, German, Spanish&quot;):
* Knight / Dame of the Collar(, , , )
* Knight / Dame Grand Cross (KGCHS / DGCHS)(, , , )
* Knight Commander with Star / Dame Commander with Star (KC*HS / DC*HS) (, , , ) (, , , )
* Knight / Dame Commander (KCHS / DCHS)(, , , )(, , )
* Knight / Dame (KHS / DHS)(, , , )

In English, a female member of this order is sometimes called &quot;lady&quot; in reaction to the US slang use of the term &quot;dame&quot; to refer to any woman. However, in accordance with standard chivalric practice in English, female members are called &quot;dame&quot; (from the Latin title , Italian , etc.) and this is the usual practice in most lieutenancies.

===Canons===

In accordance with the origins of the order, and considered more consistent with ordained ministry than the military title of knight, invested clergy are &quot;ipso facto&quot; Titular Canons of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, though Grand Master John Patrick Foley argued that this would be better applied to clergy with the rank of commander. Additionally, deacons, priests and bishops may also be given the distinguished honorary title of canon of the Holy Sepulchre personally by the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem. Both titular canons of the Holy Sepulchre (EOHSJ) and Honorary Canons of the Holy Sepulchre of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem are entitled to identical insignia, i.e. white mozetta with red Jerusalem cross and choir dress including the black cassock with magenta piping and magenta fascia.

===Saints and beatified members===

*Saint Contardo of Este (1216 - 16 April 1249)
* Pope St Pius X (2 June 1835 – 20 August 1914)
* Blessed Giuseppe Benedetto Dusmet (15 August 1818 – 4 April 1894)
* Blessed Andrea Carlo Ferrari (13 August 1850 – 2 February 1921)
* Blessed Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster (18 January 1880 – 30 August 1954)
* Blessed Bartolo Longo (10 February 1841 – 5 October 1926)
* Blessed Aloysius Viktor Stepinac (8 May 1898 – 10 February 1960)

==Awards and distinctions==
Reserved to members, the Palm of Jerusalem is the decoration of distinction, in three classes. Additionally, knights and dames who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land receive the Pilgrim Shell, a reference to the shells used as a cup by the pilgrims in the Middle Ages. Both of these distinctions were created in 1949. They are generally awarded by the grand prior of the order, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem.

Since 1949, the Cross of Merit of the Order may also be conferred on meritorious non-members of the order, for example non-Catholics. The original five classes were reduced to three in 1977. Obtaining the Cross of Merit does not imply membership of the Order.

Although it shares the same symbol, the Jerusalem Pilgrim&#x27;s Cross is not a decoration of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Pope Leo XIII created the award in 1901 but the Franciscan custodian of the Holy Land presents it to certain pilgrims in the name of the pope.

<text>The Proletarian Party of America (PPA) was a small communist political party in the United States, originating in 1920 and terminated in 1971. Originally an offshoot of the Communist Party of America, the group maintained an independent existence for over five decades. It is best remembered for carrying forward Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., the oldest publisher of Marxist books in America.

== Organizational history ==

===Formation===

The Proletarian Party of America (PPA) emerged from the Socialist Party of Michigan, based in Detroit in 1920, but the organization&#x27;s story dates to a few years prior to this event. The Michigan party, the state affiliate of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), was won over to a unique Left Wing ideology during the years of American participation in World War I.

The key figure in the Michigan organization which later became the PPA was a Scottish born shoe store owner named John Keracher, in association with a tool and die maker named Dennis Batt and radical activists Al Renner and H. M. Wicks. At Keracher&#x27;s behest, the Socialist Party of Michigan eschewed all participation in electoral politics, instead favoring Marxist theoretical study to prepare the working class for the task of revolutionary leadership. Throughout the years of 1918 and 1919, the party established a network of Marxist study circles called &quot;Proletarian Universities,&quot; with the movement particularly strong in Detroit, Chicago, and Rochester, New York.

At the 1919 State Convention of the Socialist Party of Michigan, Keracher was elected head of the state organization and an amendment was adopted by the assembled delegates calling for the expulsion from the Socialist Party of Michigan of anyone who engaged in electoral politics. Keracher, Batt, and other Michiganders were prominent as well in the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, a formal faction deeply inspired by the Russian Revolution which was engaged in the attempt to &quot;win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing.&quot;

The Left Wing Section organized candidate slates for each of the electoral districts of the SPA and made use of bloc voting by sympathetic branches of the party&#x27;s language federations to achieve results. The outgoing National Executive Committee of the SPA cried election fraud, however, and refused to tally the results of the 1919 party election or to leave office on July 1, the appointed date. Instead, the outgoing NEC went on the offensive with a series of suspensions of language federations and the expulsion of the Michigan party, ostensibly for violation of the national constitution of the SPA for the anti-political provisions adopted at the 1919 state gathering.

Keracher and the Michigan socialists allied with the suspended language federations in calling for immediate formation of a Communist Party of America, as opposed to the tactics advocated by Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld of the NEC of continuing the fight to its conclusion at the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA, scheduled for August 30 in Chicago. Wagenknecht, Katterfeld, and their associates wound up bolting the Emergency National Convention to establish the Communist Labor Party of America, while Keracher, Batt, and the federations formed a rival Communist Party of America. Two years of bitter struggle followed between these competing Communist organizations.

The idiosyncratic Michiganders were a poor match for the disciplined and highly orthodox Communists of the federations led by Alexander Stoklitsky, Oscar Tyverovsky, and Nicholas Hourwich of the Russian Communist Federation and Joseph Stilson of the Lithuanian Communist Federation. Early in 1920, a split ensued, due in part to the decision of the Michigan group to continue the public operation of the Proletarian Universities and to publish their monthly journal, &quot;The Proletarian,&quot; outside of the control of the Central Executive Committee. The Communist Party&#x27;s Executive Secretary, C.E. Ruthenberg, recalled the necessary change of the Communist Party to an underground organization after the Palmer Raids of January 1920 as the root cause of the problem. The expelled Michigan &quot;Proletarian University&quot; would soon establish themselves as the Proletarian Party of America.

The new party attempted without success to gain affiliation with the Communist International for a few years before eventually abandoning the mission. In 1922, the unified CPUSA attempted to recruit the PPA into its legal arm, the Workers Party of America and the Trade Union Educational League on its own terms, to no avail.

===The Proletarian Party and Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co.===

Keracher&#x27;s work with Detroit&#x27;s Proletarian University had brought him into close contact with Charles H. Kerr, founder of Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., the largest Marxist publishing house in the United States. Keracher became a member of the Kerr Board of the Directors in 1924 and in 1928 Charles Kerr sold him the bulk of his controlling shares in the firm. Thereafter, the Proletarian Party controlled the operations of Kerr &amp; Co., publishing a number of Keracher&#x27;s works, including &quot;How the Gods Were Made&quot; (1929), &quot;Producers and Parasites&quot; (1935), &quot;The Head-Fixing Industry&quot; (1935), &quot;Crime: It&#x27;s Causes and Consequences&quot; (1937), and &quot;Frederick Engels&quot; (1946).

Owing to poor finances, few other new Kerr titles were ever published by the PPA, although the backlist of the company was no doubt invaluable in maintaining the organization&#x27;s solvency.

H. M. Wicks wound up returning to the Communist Party of America, where he was known as a bitter factionalist. Dennis Batt retired from radical politics after a time, to become a labor journalist and staunch supporter of the American Federation of Labor. The banner of the PPA and Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. was carried forward by Al Wysocki following Keracher&#x27;s retirement as National Secretary in 1954.

===Publications===

The official organ of the PPA was a monthly magazine called &quot;The Proletarian,&quot; which originally served a newsheet for the left wing inside the Socialist Party of Michigan. &quot;The Proletarian&quot; launched in May 1918 and continued to be issued each month until July 1931, when it was superseded by &quot;Proletarian News,&quot; which was launched in 1932 and terminated in May 1961 (Vol 30 No. 1 Whole 318). Both publications were monthlies. During its final years, &quot;Proletarian News&quot; was produced via mimeograph owing to the small size of the party membership.

In 1923 the party briefly experimented with a four page weekly &quot;Labor Digest: Devoted to the Working Class Struggle for Power&quot;. The newspaper last twelve issues from June 2, 1923 to September 22, 1923.

Throughout its history, the group also published an irregular mimeographed internal discussion newsletter called &quot;Proletarian Bulletin,&quot; as well as a short-lived publication for its youth section, &quot;Proletarian Youth.&quot;

===Electoral politics===

The Proletarian Party periodically ran its own candidates for electoral office, particularly in the state of Michigan, where it retained some organizational viability. In 1932 the party ran two candidates in that state, Al Renner for Governor and Anthony Bielekas for Secretary of State.

===Decline and demise===
The party suffered two known splits in the 1930s. During one in the early 1930s a faction of the party&#x27;s youth group split off to join with a group of German Left Communists to form the United Workers Party, which soon changed its name to the Council Communists. In 1937 a group disagreeing with its attitude toward the Soviet Union split and formed the Marxist Workers Party.

In 1953, Al Wysocki succeeded John Keracher as National Secretary of the PPA. The organization remained based in Chicago, but showed a steady decline in interest and participation, withering to the point that by 1964 only two locals remained — Chicago and Flint, Michigan.

The Proletarian Party was effectively terminated with the death of National Secretary Wysocki in 1971.

===Legacy===

The papers of the Proletarian Party of America are housed in the Special Collections department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Over 20 linear feet of material is included in the collection, including correspondence files, newspaper clippings, financial documents, publications, and printer&#x27;s slugs for original artwork.

<text>The precentral sulcus is a part of the human brain that lies parallel to, and in front of, the central sulcus. A &quot;sulcus&quot; is one of the prominent grooves on the surface of the human brain.

The precentral sulcus divides the inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri from the precentral gyrus. In most brains, the precentral sulcus is divided into two parts: the inferior precentral sulcus and the superior precentral sulcus. However, the precentral sulcus may sometimes be divided into three parts or form one continuous sulcus.

<text>The Synchrophasotron was a synchrotron-based particle accelerator for protons at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna that was operational from 1957 to 2003. It was designed and constructed under supervision of Vladimir Veksler, who had invented the synchrotron independently from Edwin McMillan.

Its final energy for protons, and later deuterium nuclei, was 10 GeV.

<text>Fredegond Cecily Shove ( ) (&quot;née&quot; Maitland; 1889–1949) was an English poet. Two collections of her poetry were published in her lifetime, and a small selection also appeared after her death.

==Early life and publications==
Fredegond Cecily Maitland was the daughter of a legal historian, Frederic William Maitland, and his wife Florence Henrietta Fisher. Her mother was a maternal first cousin to Virginia Woolf and sister of Adeline Maria Fisher, the wife of Ralph Vaughan Williams. Her mother&#x27;s second marriage to Francis Darwin in 1913 brought her in contact with his extended family. She attended Newnham College in 1910–1913 and during that period also spent time in London with the Vaughan Williams. In 1915 she married the economist Gerald Shove, who like her own family, had links with the Bloomsbury group. As a conscientious objector doing farming as his alternative service, he worked at Garsington Manor near Oxford for most of 1916–1917. The future Juliette Huxley, who was working there as a French tutor, later reminisced: &quot;In those days... I saw a good deal of Fredegond Shove, Gerald&#x27;s wife, who lived like a Spartan at the Bailiff&#x27;s Cottage.&quot; Their employer, Lady Ottoline Morrell, also remembered Fredegond then as &quot;an enchanting creature, very sensitive, delicate and highly strung, with a fantastic imagination&quot;.

In 1918, the Oxford publisher Benjamin Henry Blackwell brought out her first poetry collection, &quot;Dreams and Journeys&quot;, several poems from which were soon anthologised. One of them, &quot;The Farmer 1917&quot;, conjures an evocative rural scene amidst the anguish of war, which suited it for &quot;The Paths of Glory&quot; (1919), a post-war anthology covering the broader field of poetry written in the period. It was later anthologized in &quot;Modern British Poetry&quot; (New York 1925), &quot;Twentieth Century Verse&quot; (Toronto 1945), &quot;Men who March away&quot; (London 1965) and the &quot;Penguin Book of World War 1 Poetry&quot; (2006). Another obliquely anti-war poem, &quot;A man dreams that he is the creator&quot;, had appeared in Norman Angell&#x27;s pacifist monthly &quot;War and Peace&quot; before inclusion in &quot;Dreams and Journeys&quot;. The following year it appeared in the American anthology &quot;The Book of Modern British Verse&quot; (Boston, 1919) and translated by Rafael Cansinos-Asséns in the Hispano-American review &quot;Cervantes&quot;.
The poem in Shove&#x27;s collection referred to most often was &quot;The New Ghost&quot;, a mystical tale of a departing soul met by the Divine in a springtime setting. It has an almost conversational rhythm. It was among four chosen for &quot;Georgian Poetry 1918–19&quot;, and in 1925 it was set to music by Ralph Vaughan Williams as one of his &quot;Four Poems by Fredegond Shove&quot;. In typifying the poetic trends of the time, the introduction to &quot;An Anthology of Modern Verse&quot; (1921) noted &quot;that something like a return to religion is in process.&quot; Robert Strachan in his Edinburgh lectures on contemporary writing called it &quot;a very remarkable short poem... unique in modern poetry&quot;, Herbert Palmer too identified Fredegond as a religious poet on the strength of &quot;The New Ghost&quot; – &quot;one of the best half dozen poems in the book&quot;. It also appeared in &quot;The Golden Book of English Poetry 1870–1920&quot;, the Anglo-American &quot;Home Book of Modern Verse&quot; (New York 1925), the &quot;Oxford Book of Christian Verse&quot; (1940) and &quot;Twentieth Century Verse&quot; (Toronto 1945). In 1958 it returned in another Anglo-American anthology: &quot;Modern Verse in English 1900–1950&quot;.

Shove&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; as &quot;the first, arguably token, woman&quot; to appear in the series caused some ill will in the poetry politics of the time. She was preferred over candidates who were being urged on the editor as more experienced and progressive, such as Charlotte Mew, Rose Macaulay and Edith Sitwell. Later critics have been unkind about Vaughan Williams&#x27;s use of her work, speculating that he only set her poems because of their family relationship and describing her as &quot;a wholly unexceptional poet&quot;.

Even so, the 1920s for her were a time of popularity and prosperity. Besides the anthology appearances already mentioned, a different selection of five poems appeared in &quot;Cambridge Poets 1914–1920&quot;, two poems in W H Davies&#x27;s anthology &quot;Shorter Lyrics of the Twentieth Century 1900-1922&quot;, and one in &quot;Eighty Poems: an anthology&quot; (1924). However, the period had started with her mother&#x27;s death in 1920, after which she became preoccupied with religion and joined into the Catholic Church two years later.

==Later life==
In 1922 Fredegond Shove’s second collection, &quot;Daybreak&quot;, was published by the Woolfs from their Hogarth Press, but there is no evidence that its 23 poems had the same impact. Something is there of her earlier manner, which Harold Monro had called &quot;an uncanny sense of the reality beneath fact. Her subliminal is her actual existence.&quot; It was for this that Byron Adams, commenting in later times on the religious aspects of her work, described her as a &quot;minor symbolist&quot;. Her spiritualised vision is typically manifest in &quot;Revelation&quot;: 
&lt;poem&gt;:::::Near as my hand
::The transformation: (time to understand
:::::Is long but never far,
:::::As things desirèd are:)
::No iceberg floating at the pole; no mark
::Of glittering, perfect consciousness, nor dark
::And mystic root of riddles; death nor birth,
::Except of heart, when flesh is changed from earth
::To heaven involved in it: not at all strange,
::Not set beyond the common, human range;
::Possible in the steep, quotidian stream,
:::::Possible in a dream;
::Achieved when all the energies are still –
:::::Especially the will.&lt;/poem&gt;
The tentative pointing here to a reality underlying outward appearance has been cited by a later religious commentator as the kind of mystical epiphany found &quot;even in the most ordinary moments of life&quot;.

Fredegond Shove&#x27;s one other book in her lifetime was a study of Christina Rossetti (Cambridge 1931). However, she continued to write poetry throughout her life, publishing selections from time to time. In &quot;Atalanta&#x27;s Garland&quot; (1926) there are three poems. Lascelles Abercrombie, one of her associates from &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot;, asked for previously unpublished work to include in his anthology &quot;New English Poems&quot; in 1931, and the following year she was asked by Charles du Bos for poems to include in his Catholic review &quot;Vigile&quot;, for which he provided prose translations.

After her death in 1949, Shove was buried with her husband and other family members in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge. Her sister Ermengarde Maitland (1887–1968) acted as her literary executor and had the poet&#x27;s brief memoirs of her early years and married life privately published as &quot;Fredegond and Gerald Shove&quot; (1952). In the introduction to this, she described sorting through the house and finding poems &quot;everywhere: fairly copied in note-books, scribbled on bits of paper, stuffed into bookcases, cupboards and desks – one would not have been surprised to have found them in the oven – literally hundreds of poems.&quot;

A selection of 32 poems was published by Cambridge University Press in 1956. Included were some from her two earlier books, a few that had appeared in various places since, and more that were unpublished. In the prefatory note, Ermengarde summarised her sister&#x27;s account of the interior vision impelling her to write. &quot;She told of her earliest sense of &#x27;the Almighty&#x27;s sheltering roof tree&#x27;, of the fear that came to her as she viewed this &#x27;secondary world&#x27;. &#x27;I was shocked and sickened at the ways of one world, whilst I clung, ever more secretly, to the faint legacy which the other had left me.&#x27; She told also of that day at the age of fourteen &#x27;in the charity of the brown autumn sunlight, I felt myself to be one of those who must try to relate their experiences, and to whom experiences are scenes, colours and sounds always, rather than events or actions.&#x27;&quot; It is as faithful a characterisation of her work as any.

<doc id="993906" wikidata="Q978662" url="?curid=993906" title="Perry Saturn">
<text>Perry Arthur Satullo (born October 25, 1966) is an American retired professional wrestler known by his ring name, Perry Saturn. Since debuting in 1990, Saturn wrestled for promotions including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He is a former ECW World Tag Team Champion, WCW World Tag Team Champion, WCW World Television Champion, WWF European Champion and WWF Hardcore Champion.

==Early life==
Satullo enlisted in the United States Army for four years at the age of seventeen, before eventually embarking on a career in professional wrestling. Satullo finished a bachelor&#x27;s degree before he became a full-time wrestler. Satullo is also a certified graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School and has served in the United States Army Rangers.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1990–1995)===
Satullo began training as a professional wrestler at Killer Kowalski&#x27;s school in Malden, Massachusetts around 1988, taking the ring name Saturn from the Roman god of the same name before later tweaking it to Perry Saturn. He debuted on October 27, 1990, in Waltham, Massachusetts. Satullo also wrestled in Kowalski&#x27;s International Wrestling Federation as &quot;The Iron Horseman&quot;, a cowboy complete with black leather stetson and chaps. Satullo eventually won the IWF Light Heavyweight Championship. Satullo began wrestling for independent promotions throughout New England, as well as touring Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling in 1993. In June 1992 he worked as enhancement talent in WWF.

While working as the manager of a nightclub in Boston, Satullo met bouncer George Caiazzo, who expressed an interest in becoming a wrestler. Satullo sent Caiazzo to Kowalski&#x27;s school to train, and then offered to form a tag team with him. The Greek equivalent of the god Saturn was Cronus, so Satullo chose the ring name &quot;John Kronus&quot; for Caiazzo. As Saturn and Cronus were their cultures&#x27; respective gods of the harvest, Satullo proposed that they be known as &quot;The Harvesters of Sorrow&quot;. Promoter Jerry Lawler advised Satullo that the significance of the name would not be evident to many fans, so they became known as The Eliminators.

The Eliminators wrestled their first match together at a United States Wrestling Association (USWA) house show in 1993 in Tennessee. They were hired at a starting salary of $40 a week (they later successfully negotiated a 100% pay raise),and shared an apartment with four other wrestlers. The Eliminators won the World Tag Team Championship on May 2, 1994, from Satullo&#x27;s mentor, Eddie Gilbert, and Brian Christopher. They held the titles until June 13 when they were defeated by PG-13. Satullo later traveled to Japan with Caiazzo to wrestle for Wrestle Association &quot;R&quot;. On March 22, 1994, Saturn wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in Lowell, MA.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1997)===
The compactly-built and heavily tattooed Satullo and the high-flying Caiazzo caught the attention of Paul Heyman&#x27;s Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) when they were brought in to job to the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott), and the Eliminators were hired by ECW in 1995. Heyman quickly abandoned plans to give them a sadism and masochism gimmick and instead booked them as an unstoppable force in the ECW tag division, giving them a manager, Jason. The Eliminators captured the ECW Tag Team Titles three times between 1996 and 1997, and feuded with teams such as The Gangstas and The Pitbulls. After The Pitbulls&#x27; manager Francine cut Saturn&#x27;s hair, he shaved his head in a homage to Mickey Knox, the character depicted by Woody Harrelson in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (in reality, Satullo was beginning to go bald).

Satullo was a trainer in the ECW House of Hardcore, a professional wrestling school at which Taz and Mikey Whipwreck also taught. Saturn was respected for his focus and drive on fundamentals and technical wrestling.

On May 31, 1997, in Trenton, New Jersey, Satullo tore his ACL when he landed on a crutch while executing a kick on Big Dick Dudley. After intense reconstructive surgery, he was given a recovery time of up to a year. He began rehabilitating after two months and returned to action in August. Impatient with what he regarded as Caiazzo&#x27;s lack of motivation and dedication, he refused to reform the Eliminators. Paul Heyman offered to release him from his contract if he could find alternative employment, and Satullo entered into negotiations with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

=== World Championship Wrestling (1997–2000) ===

====Raven&#x27;s Flock (1997–1998)====
On August 28, 1997, Satullo was offered a job by WCW road agent Terry Taylor, who had been impressed by a bump that Satullo had taken in a scaffold match. He debuted in WCW on September 8, facing Billy Kidman, but was sidelined for a month afterward as his knee had not entirely healed. Later that year, he and Kidman joined The Flock, a heel stable of misfits and misanthropists led by the nihilistic Raven. Saturn&#x27;s childhood was referenced, with Raven bringing up the violence Saturn incurred at the hands of his stepfather. The enforcer of The Flock, Saturn won gold on November 3, 1997, when he defeated Disco Inferno to win the World Television Championship. He held the title for a month before losing it back to Inferno in a rematch.

Beginning in 1998, Saturn began feuding with Glacier after Saturn&#x27;s usage of the Super Kick offended Glacier, who deemed it a plagiarism of his Cryonic Kick finisher. Later in the year, Saturn was defeated by fellow Flock member Van Hammer in a &quot;Loser Leaves The Flock&quot; match. Raven threw Hammer out of the Flock instead. Problems arose between Raven and Saturn, and the latter eventually left The Flock, turning face by standing up to the domineering Raven. Raven held all the other Flock members in thrall, so Saturn challenged him to match for the September 13 Fall Brawl pay-per-view. If Saturn won, The Flock would be freed, but if Raven won, Saturn would become his slave.

In the meantime, on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Raven&#x27;s lackey Lodi challenged him to a match, with the stipulation that Lodi would leave The Flock if Saturn won, and Saturn would become Lodi&#x27;s servant until Fall Brawl if he lost. Saturn unexpectedly lost following copious interference from The Flock, and Lodi forced Saturn to carry his bags, made him hold up pro-Lodi signs at ringside, and ordered him to chant Lodi&#x27;s name while Lodi wrestled. Lodi also used Saturn to defeat the enemies of The Flock.

Raven began questioning whether Saturn could &quot;hurt those he wants to free so badly&quot; and forced him to face Riggs. Saturn won cleanly, but refused Raven&#x27;s order to break Riggs&#x27; fingers. When Saturn refused, Raven broke his fingers (Saturn would not break his agreement with Lodi because of a personal honor code, and Lodi ordered him to allow Raven to harm him). Raven repeatedly tried to goad Saturn into breaking his word, but was unable to do so. Finally, on September 13 at Fall Brawl, Saturn defeated Raven with help from Kidman, disbanding The Flock forever.

====The Revolution (1999–2000)====

Saturn went on to feud with Eddie Guerrero and Ernest Miller before beginning a rivalry with Chris Jericho. After Jericho cost Saturn a number of matches with the help of crooked referee Scott Dickinson, he mocked Saturn&#x27;s complaints and accused him of crying &quot;like a schoolgirl.&quot; This led to Jericho challenging Saturn to a &quot;loser wears a dress for ninety days&quot; match at Souled Out on January 17, 1999, which he won after some suspect officiating from Dickinson. Taking on a bizarre, goth transvestite gimmick, Saturn began wearing a variety of dresses to the ring and using a variation of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; as his entrance music. He appeared to begin enjoying wearing dresses and even wore cosmetics to complement them. Saturn finally stopped wearing them after defeating Jericho in a dog collar match at Uncensored on March 14, 1999.

Raven and Saturn reunited in March 1999, feuding with Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit, members of the Four Horsemen. At Slamboree the former Flock members defeated Benoit and Malenko and champions Rey Misterio, Jr. and Billy Kidman for the World Tag Team Championship. After Raven was injured, Saturn lost the titles to Bam Bam Bigelow and Diamond Dallas Page when Chris Kanyon, who substituted for Raven, betrayed him. He then teamed with Benoit in order to regain the titles. They were successful, but lost the titles several days later to Page and Kanyon. Benoit and Saturn continued to team together, and eventually formed a stable with Shane Douglas and Dean Malenko known as The Revolution. After Benoit left the Revolution to align himself with Bret Hart, the remainder of the stable began feuding with him. They then moved on to feuds with Jim Duggan and The Filthy Animals before disbanding.

Booker Kevin Sullivan opined that Saturn was incapable of getting over with fans, prompting the wrestler to negotiate with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In January 2000, Saturn, along with Benoit, Malenko and Eddie Guerrero, was granted a release from WCW and signed a three-year contract with the WWF.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2000–2002) ===

====The Radicalz (2000–2001)====

Benoit, Guerrero, Saturn, and Malenko, dubbed The Radicalz, debuted in the WWF during the Attitude Era on January 31, 2000. They appeared in the front row of a live episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and brawled with the New Age Outlaws after The Road Dogg literally fell into their laps. Cactus Jack urged them to help him fight the heel McMahon-Helmsley Faction, but they quickly turned on Jack in order to gain employment from Triple H, who was then controlling the WWF. Benoit left the group on amicable terms when he became sidetracked by his feud with Chris Jericho, and the three remaining Radicalz began feuding with Too Cool and Chyna. After Guerrero left to be with Chyna, Saturn and Malenko teamed together for a while before disbanding.

Saturn moved into the Hardcore division, pursuing then-champion Crash Holly. After Malenko tried to win the Hardcore Championship for himself, the former partners turned on one another. Guerrero was drawn into their feud, leading to a triple threat match at Judgment Day with Guerrero&#x27;s European Championship on the line. Guerrero was able to retain with the assistance of Chyna.

Saturn was later joined by Terri Runnels, who became his manager and onscreen girlfriend. After failing to proceed in the King of the Ring tournament, Saturn went after the European Championship once more, finally beating Guerrero at Fully Loaded on July 23. Terri&#x27;s rivalry with The Kat led to a feud between Saturn and Al Snow, and on the August 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Snow defeated Saturn for the European Championship.

The Radicalz reformed in late 2000, feuding with the revived D-Generation X (DX) and defeating them at Survivor Series. That same evening, the Radicalz attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin during his match with Triple H, briefly reforging their alliance with Triple H.

Dean Malenko began trying to win the affections of Lita, the valet of The Hardy Boyz. This led to a feud between the Radicalz and The Hardy Boyz, with the former defeating the latter at Armageddon. Saturn helped Guerrero defeat Test at WrestleMania X-Seven, but Guerrero later left the Radicalz once more, again reducing the faction to just Saturn and Malenko (Benoit had left in early 2001), with Terri still accompanying Saturn. The remaining Radicalz returned to the tag team division.

====&#x27;Moppy&#x27; and departure (2001–2002)====
After a match on the May 17, 2001 episode of &quot;Jakked&quot;, in which he legitimately attacked jobber Mike Bell, Saturn immediately underwent a significant gimmick change and, possibly as punishment for his actions, was involved in storylines about his becoming infatuated with a mop. After receiving head trauma in matches against The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) and Raven, Saturn began acting eccentrically and speaking nonsensically, allegedly as the result of a concussion. Saturn began uttering the phrase &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot; at inopportune intervals, and then fell in love with Moppy, an inanimate mop which he believed was alive, similar to Wilson the volleyball in the 2000 film &quot;Cast Away&quot;. This gimmick went over well with the fans, leading to a face turn. Terri Runnels told Saturn to choose between Moppy and her, and was infuriated when Saturn chose the mop. She left Saturn for Raven, who helped her enact vengeance on Saturn by stealing Moppy and feeding her into a woodchipper. Saturn in turn gained a measure of revenge when he defeated Raven at Unforgiven on September 23. After this, Saturn dropped the gimmick, but still remained a face, casually wrestling in tag matches at &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;.

In March 2002 the WWF initiated its brand extension in which Raw and SmackDown! had their own rosters of WWF wrestlers. During the draft, Saturn was SmackDown!&#x27;s 29th pick, the 58th pick overall and the final pick of the entire draft. Saturn&#x27;s last WWF match was a tag team match with Hugh Morrus defeating Mr. Perfect and Shawn Stasiak on March 28 at a house show. Then just a month later Saturn reinjured his ACL, sidelining him for seven months, before being released by the company in November 2002.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)===
Saturn debuted in the Nashville, Tennessee-based promotion NWA-TNA on March 26, 2003, teaming with The Sandman and The Disciples of the New Church (Brian Lee and Slash) to defeat the Harris Brothers and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper). Saturn and The Sandman formed a short-lived stable known as &quot;Team Extreme&quot; with fellow ECW alumni Justin Credible and New Jack. On April 16, 2003, Saturn faced the debuting Mike Awesome, losing by disqualification after his stablemates interfered on his behalf. One week later, Saturn, New Jack and The Sandman defeated Awesome and The New Church in a hardcore match. Saturn wrestled his final match with NWA-TNA on June 18, 2003, defeating Kenzo Suzuki by disqualification.

===International promotions (2002–2004)===
Immediately after leaving the WWF, Saturn toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in their European tour, mainly working against Sabu.
Saturn worked for New Japan Pro-Wrestling and on the American independent circuit before retiring from professional wrestling due to injuries in 2004. He would be homeless for years due to drug addiction.

===Return to Wrestling (2011–2013)===
Saturn returned to wrestling in 2011, wrestling his first match in over seven years on October 15, 2011, at the AWE Night of the Legends pay-per-view show from Fishersville, Virginia facing CW Anderson. Saturn won the match.
Saturn won his first championship in over a decade as he defeated Arik Cannon &amp; Sir Bradley Charles in a Triple Threat match for the 3XW Pure Wrestling championship on April 27 in Des Moines, Iowa. In March 2013, Saturn wrestled at Jerry Lynn&#x27;s retirement show for Heavy On Wrestling in Minneapolis, MN. He competed in the opening six-man tag match, where his team came out victorious. Saturn entered the Extreme Rising World Championship tournament which was eventually won by Stevie Richards, he was defeated in the first round by Luke Hawx.

===Other appearances===
In October 2021, Saturn appeared at Awesome Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s Night of the Legends in Fishersville, Virginia.

==Personal life==
Satullo claims to have been involved in an April 2004 altercation with two men when he came to the aid of a woman they were in the process of raping behind a strip club. He reportedly fought the men and was shot with a .25 caliber handgun in the back of the neck and in the right shoulder, to which he originally thought he had received a punch, (as stated in a YouShoot) as a result of the scuffle. After being shot, Satullo became addicted to methamphetamine and was homeless for two and a half years. Satullo disappeared from public view and was not seen for several years, with his family and friends unaware of his whereabouts. Satullo re-emerged in 2010, having resolved his addiction.

Satullo married Lisa Marie Kuhlemeier in June 2009. He has been married on three prior occasions. He has a teenage grandson that he looks after, in addition to an adult son and daughter.

During an interview with Bill Apter in September 2016, Satullo revealed that he was dealing with a &quot;traumatic brain injury&quot; that limited his abilities. In November 2016, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Satullo had joined a class action lawsuit against WWE, litigated by Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against them, alleging that &quot;he is suffering from multiple symptoms of repetitive traumatic brain injuries and is undergoing neurological care.&quot; US District judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in late 2018.

<doc id="993916" wikidata="Q1328330" url="?curid=993916" title="Hardboiled">
<text>Hardboiled (or hard-boiled) fiction is a literary genre that shares some of its characters and settings with crime fiction (especially detective fiction and noir fiction). The genre&#x27;s typical protagonist is a detective who battles the violence of organized crime that flourished during Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933) and its aftermath, while dealing with a legal system that has become as corrupt as the organized crime itself. Rendered cynical by this cycle of violence, the detectives of hardboiled fiction are often antiheroes. Notable hardboiled detectives include Dick Tracy, Philip Marlowe, Nick Charles, Mike Hammer, Sam Spade, Lew Archer, Slam Bradley, and The Continental Op.

==Genre pioneers==
The style was pioneered by Carroll John Daly in the mid-1920s, popularized by Dashiell Hammett over the course of the decade, and refined by James M. Cain and by Raymond Chandler beginning in the late 1930s. English writer Gerald Butler was referred to as the &quot;English James M. Cain&quot;, and his characters were noted as hardboiled. Its heyday was in 1930s–50s America.

==Pulp fiction==
From its earliest days, hardboiled fiction was published in and closely associated with so-called pulp magazines. Pulp historian Robert Sampson argues that Gordon Young&#x27;s &quot;Don Everhard&quot; stories (which appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; magazine from 1917 onwards), about an &quot;extremely tough, unsentimental, and lethal&quot; gun-toting urban gambler, anticipated the hardboiled detective stories. In its earliest uses in the late 1920s, &quot;hardboiled&quot; did not refer to a type of crime fiction; it meant the tough (cynical) attitude towards emotions triggered by violence.

The hardboiled crime story became a staple of several pulp magazines in the 1930s; most famously &quot;Black Mask&quot; under the editorship of Joseph T. Shaw, but also in other pulps such as &quot;Dime Detective&quot; and &quot;Detective Fiction Weekly&quot;. Consequently, &quot;pulp fiction&quot; is often used as a synonym for hardboiled crime fiction or gangster fiction; some would distinguish within it the private-eye story from the crime novel itself. In the United States, the original hardboiled style has been emulated by innumerable writers, including James Ellroy, Paul Cain, Sue Grafton, Chester Himes, Paul Levine, John D. MacDonald, Ross Macdonald, Walter Mosley, Sara Paretsky, Robert B. Parker, and Mickey Spillane. Later, many hardboiled novels were published by houses specializing in paperback originals, most notably Gold Medal, and in later decades republished by houses such as Black Lizard.

==Relation to noir fiction==
Hardboiled writing is also associated with &quot;noir fiction&quot;. Eddie Duggan discusses the similarities and differences between the two related forms in his 1999 article on pulp writer Cornell Woolrich. In his full-length study of David Goodis, Jay Gertzman notes: &quot;The best definition of hard boiled I know is that of critic Eddie Duggan. In noir, the primary focus is interior: psychic imbalance leading to self-hatred, aggression, sociopathy, or a compulsion to control those with whom one shares experiences. By contrast, hard boiled &#x27;paints a backdrop of institutionalized social corruption.

<text>Lauren Bush Lauren (born Lauren Pierce Bush, June 25, 1984) is an American businesswoman who is the CEO and co-founder of FEED Projects. She is also known for her previous career as a fashion model and designer. She is the daughter of Neil Bush and Sharon Bush (née Smith), granddaughter of former U.S. president George H. W. Bush, and niece of former U.S. president George W. Bush and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

==Early life and education==
Bush was born on June 25, 1984, in Colorado and raised in Houston, Texas. She attended high school at The Kinkaid School in Houston, as did her sister Ashley and brother Pierce. In her senior year at Kinkaid, she interned for the NBC television show &quot;Friends&quot;. She was a debutante, making her formal debut in a Dior haute couture gown at le Bal des débutantes in Paris in 2000.

Bush studied fashion design at BEBE and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and graduated from Princeton University in 2006 with a B.A. in anthropology and a certificate in photography. She was a member of The Ivy Club, one of Princeton&#x27;s eleven eating clubs.

==Career==
Bush was signed with Elite Model Management before launching FEED. She has been featured on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and has frequently modelled for Tommy Hilfiger, as well as for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and designers Gai Mattiolo and Isaac Mizrahi. Bush was an intern on the television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, making a cameo in one episode, and interned alongside Ashley Olsen with designer Zac Posen. In 2005, Bush traveled to Chad as a Student Ambassador for the World Food Program.

In 2007, Lauren launched FEED Projects, a social business to fight world hunger on behalf of the UN World Food Programme.

Bush relaunched her fashion label on September 11, 2008, under the name &quot;Lauren Pierce&quot;. About her decision to use her middle name, Pierce, as opposed to her last name for the title of her line, Bush stated in November 2008 that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t a conscious decision.&quot; Further pressed, Bush said, &quot;Obviously my last name is associated with politics. But Pierce is my grandmother&#x27;s maiden name and my younger brother&#x27;s name. It&#x27;s not about downplaying my last name as much as it is about loving Pierce. And my brother is very flattered.&quot; Former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush were in the front row at the Lauren Pierce Spring 2011 show during the inaugural Houston Fashion Week, in October 2010.

==Activism==
FEED Projects has donated over 100 million meals as of October 2017 through the sale of products and fundraising activations. In 2014, Lauren led FEED in launching FEED Supper, a 30-day fundraising activation, which asks people to host dinner parties where guests donate to hunger alleviation. In 2015, she signed an open letter for which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the heads of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa, respectively, which would start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 to establish new development goals for the generation.

==Honors==
In 2012, Lauren was announced as the first National Lady Godiva Honoree of the Lady Godiva Program. In 2013, she became the 2013 Advocacy Award recipient from the World of Children Awards, in celebration of the significant work she and her organization, FEED Projects, have done for hungry children worldwide.

For her work with FEED, she was named one of &quot;Fortune&quot;&#x27;s Most Powerful Women Entrepreneurs in 2009 and one of &quot;Inc.&quot;’s 30 Under 30 in 2010. She has also received the 2010 Accessories Council Humanitarian Award, the 2011 Stevie Award for Best Non-Profit Executive, the 2011 Fashion Group International Humanitarian Award and the 2013 Women in Communications Award (WiCi). In 2014, Lauren was named as one of &quot;Forbes&quot;’ 30 Under 30 Social Entrepreneurs and one of Crain&#x27;s 40 Under 40.

==Personal life==
Bush has been a vegetarian since she was four years old.

In 2004, Bush began dating David Lauren, son of fashion designer Ralph Lauren. On September 4, 2011, the pair married in Colorado. Their first son, James Richard Lauren, was born on November 21, 2015. Their second son, Max Walker Lauren, was born on April 19, 2018, two days after Barbara Bush died. Their third son, Robert Rocky Lauren, was born on April 10, 2021.

==Architecture==
Trump World Tower has 376 units. Designed by the architect Costas Kondylis, the building is high and has 72 constructed floors (but lists 90 stories on elevator panels) with curtain wall facades of dark, bronze-tinted glass. The tower is rectangular in plan, measuring with a slenderness ratio of 11:1. The resulting large windows allow for extensive views of the East River and Midtown Manhattan. The building is constructed with concrete to increase its wind resistance.

==History==
In 1961, the 18-story United Engineering Center was built on the site. The Center was demolished to make way for the Trump World Tower. In 1997, Donald Trump and his partners, including the Daewoo Corp., a South Korean &quot;chaebol&quot;, signed a deal to purchase the site from the United Engineering Trustees for $52 million. Trump also acquired unused air rights from at least seven adjacent low-rise properties, specifically two brownstones, the Church of the Holy Family and the Japan Society. Demolition began in October 1998.

Prior to construction, many neighbors, including veteran journalist Walter Cronkite, opposed the building due to its height and lack of distinguishing exterior features. Among the concerns was that this tower would dwarf the headquarters of the United Nations across the street, in particular the United Nations Secretariat Building. East Side neighbors who opposed the project raised $400,000 in a bid to defeat it, with investment manager and philanthropist Alberto Vilar contributing $100,000. Opponents argued that the project would block views, was aesthetically unappealing, violated zoning laws, and was out of character with the surrounding neighborhood. The Municipal Art Society also challenged the project on grounds of air pollution. Opponents lost their battle in state court.

Construction of the building began in 1999. The construction was financed by two German lenders, Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank.

Trump World Tower was briefly the tallest all-residential tower in the world, prior to the completion of the 21st Century Tower in Dubai (2003) and the Tower Palace 3 in Seoul (2004). The tallest of the handful of wholly residential towers completed to date by Donald Trump, it cost approximately US$300 million to construct. The penthouse on the top two floors of the structure which totaled 20,000 square feet (1,858 m²) was priced at $58 million; however, after failing to sell for years, it was split into four different units.

Around 2006, Donald Trump was involved in a struggle with the condominium board at the Trump World Tower. Trump requested the assistance of lawyer Michael Cohen, and Trump gained control of the board.

==Occupants==
The tower&#x27;s most expensive floors attracted wealthy buyers from the former Soviet Union. Approximately 65 units were sold to Russian buyers in the late 1990s. New York Yankees star Derek Jeter purchased a 5,425-square-foot condominium for $12.6 million in 2001, and sold it in 2012 for $15.5 million. In 2002, Bill Gates, Harrison Ford, and Sophia Loren were reported to have owned or rented apartments in the building. Trump sold the 45th floor in June 2001 for $4.5 million to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which made the apartments part of its Mission to the United Nations in 2008. George and Kellyanne Conway owned a condominium unit at Trump World Tower during the early 2000s.

Socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein owns a 5,160-square-foot, eight bedroom penthouse in the Tower. In 2015 she listed it for $17.5 million, but it did not sell. In February 2017 she relisted it for $13 million.

The World Bar, a two-story bar and cocktail lounge, is located in the building. It is a popular spot among UN diplomats who work nearby.

==In popular culture==
The building and some of its condominium units have previously been featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which featured Trump. It has also appeared on the NBC syndicated television show &quot;Extra&quot; Season 13 - Ep. 193. The building also featured heavily in the 2007 film &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot;.

The main character of Don Delillo&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; holds residence in the top three floors of a building that, while unnamed, is described as the tallest residential tower in New York and located at First Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.

<doc id="993932" wikidata="Q1973669" url="?curid=993932" title="Nissan Fairlady Z (S130)">
<text>The Nissan S130 is a sports coupé produced by Nissan in Japan from 1978 until 1983. It was sold as the Datsun 280ZX, Nissan Fairlady Z and Nissan Fairlady 280Z, depending on the market. In Japan, it was exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Store locations. It was the second generation Z-car, replacing the Nissan Fairlady Z (S30) in late 1978. The 280ZX was the first time the &quot;by Nissan&quot; subscript was badged alongside the Datsun logo, along with Nissan trucks. The 280ZX was &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; import car of the year for 1979. The 280ZX was replaced by the Nissan 300ZX in 1984.

==Design goals==
The 280ZX was a complete redesign, retaining only the L28 inline-six engine and other driveline components from the 280Z. Both two-seat and four-seat (2+2) designs were offered. Compared to the more overtly sporting earlier models, the 280ZX was a much softer, heavier car, with less focus on driving and more on driver comfort and refinement. Softer suspension, better sound insulation, more comfortable seats, and ample equipment including high-end audio systems defined the new ZX. In the spirit of the times, emissions controls and aerodynamics were markedly improved over the first generation Z-cars, while weight was down somewhat as long as the buyer did not pick much from the very long options list. The exterior design was evolutionary, less rounded and with better integrated safety bumpers. Many parts, including the rear-axle and the power steering came from the Datsun 810 luxury sedan. Most of the design effort went into the entirely different and much more modern interior. The car became a grand tourer rather than a sports car, particularly in the plush Grand Luxury versions.

==Engineering==
The 280ZX adopted a suspension similar to that of the concurrent Bluebird 910, with MacPherson struts in front and semi-trailing arm independent suspension in the rear. The wheelbase was up from its predecessor () to for the two-seater.

The 280ZX&#x27;s body was redesigned with aerodynamics in mind. By closing in the open grille of the first generation Z-car and through other improvements taken from wind-tunnel testing, the drag coefficient was reduced from 0.467 to 0.385, and the lift coefficient from 0.41 to 0.14. The new design had a lower center-of-gravity and nearly 50/50 weight distribution in both the two-seater and 2+2 designs. The rear of the car was stretched to accommodate a larger 80 L (21.133 US liquid gallons) fuel tank. Overall, the new body design gave better fuel economy and high-speed stability (one of the known issues from the first generation Z-car).

The 280ZX initially offered either unassisted rack-and-pinion steering or a Datsun 810-derived recirculating-ball with power assistance. Neither came in for much appreciation in period road tests. A new power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering replaced the recirculating-ball steering system for the 1981 turbo, becoming available on the naturally aspirated models the following year.

It is a common misconception that the 280ZX&#x27;s L28 engine is less powerful than the L24 engine of the 1970 240Z or the L26 engine of the 260Z; the difference is due to Nissan adopting the SAE net standard of power measurement, which resulted in lower power ratings than the earlier gross figures and added emissions. However, Nissan designers deliberately sacrificed raw acceleration for improved fuel economy in the 280ZX, so the early 1979 models rated at actually had slower acceleration than the 240Z, largely due to increases in weight and taller gearing, as well as power losses to emissions controls. This overall performance deficit was not addressed until the release of the 280ZX Turbo in 1981.

==Marketing and sales==

The 280ZX was branded in the North American and Australian markets as the &quot;Datsun 280ZX&quot;; and in the local Japanese market as the &quot;Fairlady Z&quot;. For the 1979 model year, in the American market, it was co-branded &quot;Datsun by Nissan&quot; through the 1983 model year. These were considered transitional years, as Nissan began to phase in their new global brand under the Nissan name.

The Japanese market got both 2.0 L and 2.8 L engines. The 2.0 L-engined Fairlady 200Z used the L20 engine common in Nissan family cars of the same era. The smaller engine was offered so that it would comply with Japanese government dimension regulations, while models with the larger engine were regarded as the top-level luxury model in Japan. Export markets all got the L28-powered version. In Japan the Fairlady was joined by a Nissan Skyline-derived sedan and coupé, called the Nissan Leopard TR-X, available at Nissan Japanese dealerships called &quot;Nissan Bluebird Stores&quot;.

Two trim levels were offered in North America, with a no-frills two-seater and a fully equipped 2+2 GL. The GL package was also available for the two-seater, carrying the full equipment list. Leather seats were optional, and an optional digital instrument cluster was introduced in 1982. The T-bar roof was available on both bodystyles, but only in combination with the GL package. A &quot;Blackout&quot; package, without most of the chrome brightwork, was available for the standard two-seater.

==Changes==

===1979–1980===
Early reviews of the 280ZX were mixed. Some lamented the transformation the Z-car had made to a grand tourer, while others appreciated the improvements in refinement, comfort, and overall market appeal. The sales figures soon proved the Nissan designers right, with the 280ZX becoming a sales success.

In 1979 Datsun homologated a high-downforce &quot;whale-tail&quot; type spoiler for the Datsun 280ZX by producing 1,001 280ZX-R cars; this allowed for use of this aerodynamic aid in IMSA and SCCA racing. These cars also had distinctive body decals and ZX-R logos. These cars were identical to the other cars of this year with the exception of the spoiler and decal package. Successful IMSA racer Don Devendorf was involved in the development of the spoiler.

From 1980 onwards, the 280ZX was available with a T-bar roof (on both the two-seater and 2+2 body styles). The T-bar roof panels could be removed and stored in bags in the rear of the car.

In 1980, a limited edition &quot;10th anniversary&quot; car was released. Available in either black and gold or black and red two-tone paint, these cars came with leather seating, and other special trim features. A total of 3,000 of these cars were built - - 2,500 in black and gold, and 500 in red and black.
===1981===
A turbocharged model, using the L28ET engine rated at at 5,600 rpm and 203 ft•lbs (275n•m) of torque at 2,800 rpm, was introduced to the US export market in 1981. At the same time the Japanese domestic market received L20ET (2 L turbo) in both manual and automatic transmissions. Nissan&#x27;s concerns about the reliability of their own five-speed transmission when combined with the additional torque of the 2.8 L turbo engine, meant that no manual transmission was offered with the L28ET engine for the 1981 model year. Other export markets (Europe and Australia) continued to receive only the normally aspirated 2.8 L engine with manual or automatic transmission. This engine was considered too powerful to receive type approval by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Transportation, who would only allow turbochargers to be installed in sub 2 litre-engined cars, and it was therefore never sold in its homeland.
The turbocharged 280ZX used a single Garrett AiResearch TB03 turbocharger with an internal wastegate, and no intercooler. Nissan&#x27;s design philosophy at the time led to boost being limited to 6.8 psi (0.47 bar), despite the lowered compression of the turbo engine (7.4:1 with dished, cast aluminum pistons). Additional changes over the naturally aspirated engine included a higher volume oil pump, an oil cooler on automatic models, and Nissan&#x27;s Electronic Concentrated Control System (ECCS).
At the time of its release into the US market, the 280ZX turbo was the fastest Japanese import on the American market. The turbocharged 280ZX with a three-speed automatic delivered times of 7.4 seconds and a very respectable quarter mile time of 16.6 seconds, at a top speed of .

One criticism of the early 280ZX was a reduction in spring rates, giving a softer ride and making the car rather difficult to drive hard through corners without transient oversteer, which was a feature of trailing-arm rear suspensions. The release of the turbocharged model in 1981 saw the introduction of a revised rear suspension, which Nissan continued to use in the 1982 and 1983 turbos, as well as the non-turbo from mid-1982 onward. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; had another complaint of the 280ZX turbo: in a 1981 comparison of several performance cars, they decided that while the acceleration was on par with other sports cars of the era, the braking system was prone to fading away completely before a lap could be completed on their test track.

===1982–1983===
Nissan gave the 280ZX a facelift in 1982, with revised NACA ducting in the hood, new alloy wheels (14-inch six-spoke alloys for non-turbo models, and 15-inch four-spoke alloys for turbo models), a revised B-pillar garnish, new pin-stripe style tail-lights, and rubber bumper over-riders replaced the earlier model&#x27;s chrome and rubber items. The bumpers were now also body coloured and wrapped around further. Interior changes were minor but included new seat trim styling. The 1982 model also was the first to offer the popular voice warning system, which warned the driver when the headlights were left on after the vehicle was turned off, if the parking brake was on while the vehicle was in motion, and many others.

This facelifted model has since come to be called the &quot;Series II&quot; 280ZX.

Power steering became standard equipment with a new rack-and-pinion system, rather than recirculating ball. Changes were made to the rear suspension layout, which also meant the exhaust pipe now exited from the left, rather than right-hand side. The rear brake calipers and rotors were also changed and the drive shafts (half shafts) were upgraded from universal joints to constant velocity joints on certain models.

As in 1981 both turbo and naturally aspirated engines were offered, but non-turbo cars now used the uprated L20E for the Japanese market or the L28E for the export market, which on the 2.8 L version, due to increased compression, were rated at rather than the earlier engine&#x27;s . The naturally aspirated 1982 Datsun 280ZX boasted a 0-60 mph time of 9.1 seconds, 1.2 seconds slower than the Corvette of the same year. The 280ZX Turbo manual had a 0-60 mph time of 7.4 seconds while the automatic managed to turn out 7.1 seconds. That compares to the Aston Martin Volante, which had a 0-60 mph time of 8.9 seconds at almost seven times the cost and the Ferrari 308GTSi which had a 0-60 mph time of 7.9 seconds. The only US-market car in 1982 to beat the Turbo ZX&#x27; acceleration figures was the Porsche 911SC, which was considered by most to be an exotic car. This information can be referenced in the &quot;R&amp;T Guide to Sports &amp; GT Cars&quot; (1982).

The (US market only) 280ZX Turbo was offered with a Borg-Warner T-5 5-speed manual transmission. This was one of the first Nissan and Japanese car in general which used a non-Japanese transmission; the T-5 was also used in the GM F-bodies and Ford Mustang in addition to numerous other American domestic vehicles. The T-5 was only available in 1982 and 1983 after which Nissan USA phased in the use of local automotive components - the 1981 Turbo had only been available with an automatic. Hitherto mainly sold in the US, in the second half of 1983 the 280ZXT Turbo also became available in Germany. It was the fastest, most expensive, and most powerful (with ) Japanese car offered to that point in Germany.

Spring rates and sway bars were revised, which largely addressed the handling nervousness of the early 280ZX Turbo, and reviews confirmed that the 1982 280ZX Turbo was the most sporting Z-car since the original 240Z of 1970.

==Racing==

The 280ZX proved successful in various classes of racing, particularly in the US. Significant results include:
* 1979 SCCA C Production Category (Bob Sharp Racing 280ZX)
* 1979 and 1980 IMSA GTU Championship (Electramotive Datsun 280ZX)
* 1982 and 1983 IMSA GTO Championship (Electramotive Datsun 280ZX Turbo)

The 1983 Electramotive 280ZX Turbo produced over , and reached a terminal speed of in the standing quarter mile.

The most notable driver to be associated with the car was actor Paul Newman, who raced with the Bob Sharp Racing team. He also helped to promote the car and starred in a series of commercials.

<text>Solofa Fatu Jr. (born October 11, 1965) is an American professional wrestler, best known under the ring names Rikishi and Fatu with the WWE and also competed under the variety of names in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

Born in San Francisco, Fatu debuted in the professional wrestling business in 1985 as Prince Alofa and later competed with the Samoan SWAT Team in Japan and multiple wrestling promotions across the United States. In 1992, Fatu made his debut for the World Wrestling Federation, he had employed multiple gimmicks during his early run. He returned to the WWF in 1998 where he was repackaged as a sumo wrestler character named Rikishi Phatu, in which he dropped his last name when he began teaming with the popular Too Cool tag team. During his tenure with the company, Fatu has held the Intercontinental Champion, two-time World Tag Team Champion, and one-time WWE Tag Team Champion. After leaving the WWE in 2004, he would appear in the independent circuit, along with a short stint in TNA as Junior Fatu in 2007. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015.

Fatu is the father of Jimmy Uso, Jey Uso, and Solo Sikoa. As a prominent member of the Anoaʻi family of Samoan wrestlers, he is the brother of Sam Fatu and Umaga, uncle of Jacob Fatu and the cousin of Rosey and Roman Reigns.

==Early life==
Solofa Fatu was born on October 11, 1965, in San Francisco to Solofa Fatu Sr. and Elevera Anoaʻi Fatu, and grew up in the Sunnydale Projects in the Visitacion Valley neighborhood, where his maternal grandparents were preachers. He attended Balboa High School, and competed on the wrestling team.

In 1982, when he was seventeen years old, Fatu was wounded in a drive-by shooting that left him with a scar on his abdomen; he claimed in a 2021 interview that he had died for three minutes in the emergency room before being revived. He spent two months in the hospital, after which his mother, fearing for his safety, sent him out of state to live with her brothers Afa and Sika Anoaʻi, with whom he trained to become a professional wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1985–1986)===
Fatu began his wrestling career in 1985, working for Gino Brito and Dino Bravo&#x27;s Lutte Internationale promotion in Montreal as Prince Alofa, a high-flying babyface. He often teamed with the territory&#x27;s top faces. Fatu also worked for International Championship Wrestling in New York City in that same year.

=== Samoan Swat Team (1986–1992) ===
He and his cousin Samula Anoaʻi became the Samoan Swat Team (Samu &amp; Fatu) in 1986 for New Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1987, they signed with the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and they used the &quot;Samoan savage&quot; gimmick their relatives The Wild Samoans successfully used by working barefoot, never publicly speaking English, and no-selling attacks to the head. They became the new WWC Caribbean Tag Team Champions (after a long vacancy) on November 7, 1987, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico after defeating Invader I and Invader III. They held the title for just over a month before dropping it to Mark and Chris Youngblood before leaving the promotion.

Samu and Fatu next appeared in Texas, working for Fritz Von Erich&#x27;s World Class Championship Wrestling. Storywise, Buddy Roberts brought them in to fight his fights against the Von Erich family and former Fabulous Freebirds partner Michael Hayes. The SST were given a big push right away; presented as an unstoppable force, they beat hometown heroes Kerry and Kevin Von Erich for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship on August 12, 1988. They remained undefeated in WCCW until they dropped the belts to Hayes and his new partner, Steve Cox, on September 12. They recaptured the title four days later. Hayes and Cox beat them for the title again on October 15, and, two days later, lost it back again.

On September 12, 1988, The Samoan Swat Team became double champions by beating &quot;Hollywood&quot; John Tatum and Jimmy Jack Funk for the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship. They made their pay-per-view debut at AWA SuperClash III, the AWA&#x27;s first and last PPV. They successfully defended their World Tag title against Michael Hayes and Steve Cox.

In early 1989, the SST left WCCW, vacating both championships. Swat Team signed with Jim Crockett Promotions, introduced as manager Paul E. Dangerously&#x27;s replacement for The Original Midnight Express (Randy Rose and Dennis Condrey), who had left the promotion. The SST took over the Express&#x27; feud with The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane), beating them at Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin&#x27; Cajun on April 2, 1989. The SST teamed with former rival Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy, and Jimmy Garvin at the 1989 Great American Bash, losing a WarGames match to The Road Warriors, The Midnight Express, and Steve Williams.

In the fall of 1989, Paul E. Dangerously was phased out and the SST took a new manager, &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; Oliver Humperdink. They were also joined by Fatu&#x27;s brother, The Samoan Savage. The SST lost more and more matches as 1989 drew to a close, but got a break when Sid Vicious was injured, leading his team, The Skyscrapers, to pull out of the &quot;Iron Team Tournament&quot; at Starrcade 1989. Fatu and The Samoan Savage, rebranded as The New Wild Samoans, replaced them. For the rest of their WCW career, Fatu and Savage teamed, while Samu only wrestled singles matches.

After leaving WCW in the summer of 1990, Fatu and Savage worked for several independent promotions in the US, Europe, Puerto Rico and Japan, often teaming with cousin Kokina Maximus. The three worked for the Universal Wrestling Association in 1991, where they won the UWA Trios Tag Team Championship and held it for just under two months. They headlined the UWA&#x27;s 16th anniversary show, losing the title to Dos Caras, El Canek, and Mil Máscaras.

===World Wrestling Federation (1992–1998)===

====The Headshrinkers (1992–1995)====
After Samu and Fatu joined the World Wrestling Federation, they were renamed The Headshrinkers, but their savage gimmick remained. Kokina Maximus also joined the WWF, but was repackaged as Japanese sumo wrestler Yokozuna, and his relation to The Headshrinkers was not acknowledged. The Headshrinker&#x27;s first notable angle came when they interfered to help Money Inc. beat The Natural Disasters for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Soon after, The Headshrinkers feuded with The Natural Disasters and the recently formed High Energy.

Between 1992 and early 1994, The Headshrinkers occasionally challenged for the tag title and made sporadic PPV appearances, feuding with The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission. Fatu would receive a WWF Championship match against Bret Hart on the March 1, 1993 episode of &quot;Monday Night RAW&quot;. Despite interference by Samu, Fatu was unsuccessful.

The Headshrinkers helped Yokozuna win a casket match against The Undertaker at the 1994 Royal Rumble. In April, they turned face, took Lou Albano as their manager and challenged tag champions The Quebecers. They won the gold on the May 2 episode of Monday Night RAW. At King of the Ring on June 19, they successfully defended the title against Yokozuna and Crush. Their title reign ended at a house show in Indianapolis on August 28, when they lost to Shawn Michaels and Diesel. This happened a day before they were scheduled to defend against Irwin R. Schyster and Bam Bam Bigelow at SummerSlam. The match went on without the title, and The Headshrinkers lost by disqualification.

Soon after, Samu left the WWF to recover from injuries and was replaced by Sione (formerly The Barbarian). They were called The New Headshrinkers. The storyline reason for Samu&#x27;s departure was that he was not coping well with manager Lou Albano&#x27;s attempts to civilize him, particularly about wearing boots. The New Headshrinkers made only two PPV appearances, at the 1994 Survivor Series, where they were eliminated from their ten-man tag match, but helped their team win and at the 1995 Royal Rumble; Sione lasted about seven minutes early on and Fatu over five nearer the end. They entered a tournament to crown new WWF tag team champions in late 1994/early 1995, and lost to Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka in the semi-finals. For the first half of 1995, they worked with Jacob &amp; Eli Blu, usually putting them over. Their final match was a loss to Men on a Mission at a June 22 house show in London, England, after which Sione left for WCW and Fatu was removed from WWF television.

====&quot;Make a Difference&quot; (1995–1996)====

After a brief hiatus, Fatu reappeared as a singles wrestler in July 1995 repackaged as a streetwise positive role model, for which he filmed several vignettes in his old San Francisco neighborhood touching on his real-life upbringing in the ghetto and preaching the messages of staying in school and saying no to drugs, all while he spoke fluent English. Each segment ended with the onscreen phrase &quot;Make a Difference&quot;, making it the unofficial name of the gimmick. Fatu made his in-ring return on July 29 by pinning Rad Radford on &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;, and then enjoyed a run of victories over enhancement talent for the remainder of the year. However, the character did not get over with fans, and in 1996 Fatu was regularly booked to lose to stars such as Steve Austin, Vader, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Two men known as &quot;The Samoan Gangster Party&quot; (Fatu&#x27;s cousins Samu and Matthew Anoaʻi) additionally began showing up in the audience during his matches, but no storylines were ever developed. The &quot;Make a Difference&quot; gimmick was dropped in April 1996.

====The Sultan (1996–1998)====
In August 1996, Fatu was repackaged as a heel known as The Sultan, a red masked wrestler with curved shoes who never spoke, ostensibly because his tongue was cut out. He was managed by The Iron Sheik and Bob Backlund. He unsuccessfully challenged Rocky Maivia for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 13. The Sultan vanished in January 1998, and Fatu left to train at Dory Funk&#x27;s Funking Conservatory wrestling school. He would work from 1998 to 1999 in the independent circuit. Originally ECW star Sabu was to play The Sultan but according to Sabu in a shoot interview, he turned down the offer because he didn&#x27;t want to be managed by The Iron Sheik and that he wanted his uncle The Original Sheik to be his manager but the WWF rejected the idea.

===Independent circuit (1998–1999)===
After WWF, Fatu continued his Sultan gimmick in the independent circuit losing to Jimmy Snuka. He reunited with Samu as the Headshrinkers working for his uncle&#x27;s promotion World Xtreme Wrestling in Pennsylvania. Later that year he feuded with Billy Two Eagles for Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling in British Columbia as Fatu which lasted a year. On April 28, 1999, Fatu teamed with his cousin Yokozuna to defeat Skull Murphy Jr., Danny Collins and Blondie Barratt in a handicap match in London, England.

In May 1999, Fatu made his debut in Memphis for Power Pro Wrestling as J.R. Smooth, a rap gimmick where he started dying his hair blonde and wore sunglasses. He defeated Michael Hayes for the PPW Heavyweight Championship. He would feud with Kurt Angle and dropped the title to Angle on July 24.

===Return to WWF/E (1999–2004)===
====Too Cool and Intercontinental Champion (1999–2000)====


After training at Funk&#x27;s and working in the independents, Fatu returned on October 5, 1999, for a dark match for Sunday Night Heat defeating Crash Holly. On the November 13, 1999 episode of &quot;WWF Metal&quot; as Rikishi Fatu, beating Julio Fantastico. &quot;Rikishi&quot; is the general Japanese term for a sumo wrestler, similar to his cousin&#x27;s ring name &quot;Yokozuna&quot;. &quot;Fatu&quot; soon became &quot;Phatu&quot;, until he dropped the last name entirely after he started teaming with Too Cool. No mention was made of his WWF past. He had gained some weight, bleached his hair blonde, and wore a &quot;mawashi&quot;. Per Vince McMahon&#x27;s request and Fatu&#x27;s own willingness to honor sumo tradition, nothing was worn underneath the &quot;mawashi&quot; and his buttcheeks were exposed; this was unlike Yokozuna, who wore tights underneath the loincloth, which both McMahon and Fatu felt were unnecessary for the Yokozuna character. His ring gear gained immediate attention; on his televised debut with the gimmick on &quot;WWF Metal&quot;, play-by-play announcer Kevin Kelly responded that he was &quot;a little concerned with, well, Rikishi Fatu&#x27;s well...garment, or lack thereof,&quot; with color commentator Tom Prichard responding that &quot;there isn&#x27;t much of a garment there!&quot;.

On November 22, 1999, on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Rikishi helped Too Cool from being attacked by the Mean Street Posse. It was the first time Rikishi&#x27;s character debuted on &quot;Raw&quot;, and the first time Too Cool and Rikishi were in the ring together. Rikishi briefly feuded with Viscera before forming a wildly popular alliance with the duo Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty). One night, during Too Cool&#x27;s traditional post-match dance routine, Rikishi joined them. As the dance routines became more frequent and longer, this popularity translated to a significant push. In the 2000 Royal Rumble match, he and Too Cool did the dance to their respective songs, much to the delight of the audience. He later eliminated seven opponents, and it took six wrestlers working together to eliminate him.

Rikishi also became known for his infamous signature maneuver – the Stink Face – as his buttocks were rubbed into the faces of opposing wrestlers. When his opponent was incapacitated in the corner of the ring, Rikishi would slap his buttocks to indicate the attack, and then he would turn around, hike his thong up, and smother his buttocks into his victim&#x27;s face. On an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on May 15, 2000, Stephanie McMahon described Rikishi&#x27;s buttocks as &quot;bulbous&quot;, &quot;smelly&quot; and &quot;sweaty&quot; when describing the Stink Face. Kurt Angle, who received a Stink Face from Rikishi, said, &quot;It was the worst smell I ever smelt in my life.&quot; The Stink Face also served as a finishing move at times, as wrestlers became physically ill from the maneuver, forcing them to leave the ring and thereby losing via count out. The Stink Face became known as the most repulsive move in the World Wrestling Federation, and this humiliating maneuver became very popular with the fans.

In May 2000, fan favorites Rikishi and Too Cool feuded with Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle, culminating in a victory at Judgment Day. After winning the Intercontinental Championship from Chris Benoit on the June 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rikishi qualified for the 2000 King of the Ring tournament. On June 25, at King of the Ring, he defeated Benoit in the quarterfinals and Val Venis in the semis. Both opponents hit him with a steel chair after losing, weakening his shoulder and helping Kurt Angle defeat him in the final. Stemming from Venis&#x27; attack, Rikishi faced him on July 6 and lost the title after Tazz hit him with a television camera. They rematched in a steel cage at Fully Loaded. In this match, Rikishi climbed the cage and, in an allusion to Jimmy Snuka, splashed Venis from the top. Rikishi soon lost the match after Tazz again hit him with a camera.

====Heel turn and main event status (2000–2001)====
On the October 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Commissioner Mick Foley accused Rikishi of being the person who had run over Stone Cold Steve Austin almost a year earlier at Survivor Series, which was the day before the Rikishi gimmick officially debuted in the WWF. This was due to Scotty 2 Hotty unknowingly revealing to Foley that Rikishi was at Survivor Series when he was explaining to Foley his whereabouts on the day Stone Cold was hit. When Foley confronted Rikishi about it, he admitted to running down Stone Cold. Rikishi then said he attacked Austin in order to allow his cousin The Rock an opportunity for stardom, insisting that Buddy Rogers, Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan and Austin – &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; – had always been pushed, at the expense of Samoan wrestlers like Peter Maivia, Jimmy Snuka, Samu, Yokozuna and The Rock. After accepting full responsibility for the hit-and-run, as well as clearing The Rock of any culpability in the process, Rikishi then said if he was being honest he would run Austin down again. Rikishi left the ring and then turned heel.

Austin immediately set out for revenge, facing Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match at No Mercy. The match went to a no contest when Austin dragged Rikishi to the parking lot and tried to run him over; a police car drove in front of Austin&#x27;s, saving Rikishi. Though arrested, Austin had brutally attacked Rikishi, cutting and bruising his face. Later that night, Rikishi interfered in The Rock&#x27;s WWF Championship defense against Kurt Angle, but &quot;accidentally&quot; kicked the champ, allowing Angle to Angle Slam them both and win the title. After several attacks on Austin by an unseen assailant, it became clear that Rikishi had an accomplice. During a handicap match pitting Rikishi and Angle against Austin, Triple H came to the ring, seemingly to aid Austin, but swerved the audience by attacking him with a sledgehammer. Triple H then revealed he had masterminded the Survivor Series assault and hired Rikishi to drive the car.

While Austin began feuding with Triple H, Rikishi&#x27;s tension with The Rock boiled over. Despite delivering a Stink Face to the Rock, Rikishi would lose to him in a match at Survivor Series. He then participated in a six-man Hell in a Cell WWF Championship match at Armageddon. Vince McMahon drove a flatbed truck ringside in an effort to dismantle the cage and stop the match. Before he could, commissioner Mick Foley had McMahon, Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco forcibly removed from the arena by security. The Undertaker then chokeslammed Rikishi from the top of the cell onto the wood chip-covered bed. Kurt Angle later retained the title.

In January 2001, Rikishi won a Fatal Four Way match on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for the #30 spot in the 2001 Royal Rumble match involving Rock, Undertaker and Kane, after he pinned the latter. There, he eliminated The Undertaker, and was soon eliminated by The Rock. Haku returned to the WWF in the Rumble, and he and Rikishi formed a tag team and feuded with The Brothers of Destruction, The Dudley Boyz then The Hardy Boyz. The team split while Rikishi was sidelined with an eardrum injury in March. He returned on the May 3 &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and fought The Undertaker to no-contest. On the next &quot;Raw&quot;, he turned face once again and gave the Stink Face to Stephanie McMahon after she distracted him and cost him a non-title match with Austin. On May 20, at Judgment Day, he injured his shoulder in the opening bout with William Regal, which caused him to miss much of the year and the entire Invasion angle.

====Various storylines, reunion with Scotty 2 Hotty and departure (2001–2004)====
Rikishi returned on the December 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, delivering a Stink Face to Vince McMahon and solidifying his face status. However Rikishi never regained the same amount of popularity he once had in the year 2000; he also never got another main event push. Upon the WWF Brand Extension in March 2002, Rikishi was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. At Judgment Day on May 19, he faced Billy and Chuck in a &quot;secret partner&quot; match. His partner turned out to be Rico, Billy and Chuck&#x27;s stylist. Despite Rico&#x27;s best efforts to unfairly help Billy and Chuck, Rikishi and Rico won the match and became the WWE Tag Team Champions. Rico would later cause Rikishi to lose the titles back to Billy and Chuck in a rematch on the June 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

In early 2002, Hulk Hogan was booked to face Rikishi in Hogan&#x27;s first match back since leaving the WWF to go to rival WCW in the 1990s. Hogan won the match, but Rikishi was able to deliver a Stink Face to Hogan after the conclusion of the match.

Rikishi was not featured much in late 2002 and early 2003. He feuded with John Cena, Bill DeMott, and The Full Blooded Italians on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The return of Roddy Piper led Rikishi to challenge him as Piper had hit Jimmy Snuka with a coconut years ago on Piper&#x27;s Pit. At Backlash on April 27, Piper&#x27;s protege Sean O&#x27;Haire defeated Rikishi after Piper got hit with a coconut by Rikishi giving O&#x27;Haire time to hit the Widowmaker on Rikishi. Rikishi eventually formed a tag team with Scotty 2 Hotty, and the duo defeated the Basham Brothers for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the February 5, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, holding them for two and a half months before losing them to Charlie Haas and Rico on the April 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Fatu, however, was released by WWE on July 16, for not following up with clearance from an injury that had him out of action since the April 22 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

===Independent circuit (2004–2019)===

After WWE, Fatu continued to wrestle on the independent circuit. In October 2005, he shortened his ring name to Kishi after being notified by WWE legal representatives that WWE owned a trademark on the name &quot;Rikishi&quot;. Fatu, as Kishi, would go on to work for Nu-Wrestling Evolution, a professional wrestling promotion based in Turin Italy.
On February 17, 2007, Fatu competed as SUMO RIKISHI in a tag team contest at an All Japan Pro Wrestling event, as he was brought in by Keiji Mutoh to feud with Akebono. On August 12, 2007, Fatu competed in an 8-man tag, as Rikishi, at AAA&#x27;s TripleMania event. On August 23, Fatu competed in a Triple Threat match against Samoa Joe and Sterling James Keenan at Ballpark Brawl VIII in Buffalo, New York. On November 17, wrestling as Rikishi once again, Fatu defeated Mike Rollins at a Heavy on Wrestling event in Duluth, Minnesota.

<doc id="993940" wikidata="Q1833112" url="?curid=993940" title="Crowthorne">
<text>Crowthorne is a village, and civil parish, in the Bracknell Forest district of southeastern Berkshire, England. It had a population of 7,806 at the 2021 census. 

Crowthorne is the location of Wellington College, a large co-educational boarding and day independent school, which opened in 1859, and of Broadmoor Hospital, one of England&#x27;s three maximum-security psychiatric hospitals, which lies on the eastern edge of the village.

==History==
Crowthorne was only a hamlet until Wellington College opened in 1859 and Broadmoor Hospital in 1863. Crowthorne was originally part of the parish of Sandhurst, and acquired its name as the postal authority wished to give it a name to facilitate deliveries from Wokingham, instead of post coming from York Town (which with Cambridge Town became known as Camberley). &quot;&quot;Albertonville&quot; was suggested in hour of the Prince Consort, but the suggestion of &quot;Crowthorne&quot;&quot;, after thorn trees at Brookers Corner at the top of the village, was adopted. There was a Crowthorne Farm prior to this, and it appeared as a separate holding in the Royal Forest of Windsor in the Domesday Book, although the present farm buildings do not date back to this time. 

Crowthorne railway station, originally Wellington College for Crowthorne Station, opened in 1860 and burgeoned quickly. In the 1960s, the Transport Research Laboratory established by the UK Government as the Road Research Laboratory (RRL) opened in Crowthorne. It was privatised in 1996.

==Geography==
Crowthorne is part of the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area. It lies 4 miles (6.5 km) NNE of Camberley and some 5 miles (8 km) SSW of Bracknell. The Crowthorne urban area spills over into the neighbouring parish of Wokingham Without. However, most of the housing is in Crowthorne parish, which is part of Bracknell Forest district. North of Crowthorne is Pinewood, which has a leisure centre, cafe and miniature railway.

==Natural environment==
The Crowthorne urban area adjoins several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and local nature reserves:
*Heath Lake along its northern edge, in Wokingham Without.
*Sandhurst to Owlsmoor Bogs and Heaths form an SSSI to the south-east, mostly in Sandhurst.

==Schools==
Crowthorne houses Wellington College, a large co-educational boarding and day independent school, opened in 1859 as a monument to the Duke of Wellington (1769–1852). It became fully coeducational in 2005. Edgbarrow is a secondary school there are 5 primary schools: Hatch Ride Primary, New Scotland Hill, Crowthorne Church of England School, Wildmoor Heath (formerly Broadmoor Primary) and Oaklands Junior. There are some pre-preparatory and preparatory schools, nurseries and childcare centres for children between 3 months and 11 years old.

==Aeronautics==
C. F. Taylor grew into a large international aeronautical fabrications business, later part of British Aerospace. It was born in a shed of the Buckler premises in Heath Hill Road shortly after World War II. Metal craftsman C. F. Taylor single-handedly produced aluminium racing fairings for motorcycles and bodies for early Buckler cars.

==Local societies and community groups==
Crowthorne holds a biennial carnival, usually in early July, organised by the Crowthorne Carnival Association, with some individual events put up by local schools, groups and businesses. Crowthorne Amateur Theatrical Society was founded in 1978. The Crowthorne Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Robert Roscoe, gives three concerts a year, usually at Wellington College. It also holds an open workshop for full orchestra in September and a string workshop in May. The orchestra marked its 20th anniversary in 2011. The Crowthorne Natural History Group, founded in 1977, held its final meeting in 2013, due to a diminishing, ageing membership.

==Sports==
Crowthorne &amp; Crown Wood Cricket Club was formed in January 2014 as a merger of two existing clubs. It plays its home games in the grounds of Wellington College and at Crown Wood&#x27;s established base at St Sebastian&#x27;s. It belongs to the Saturday League Cricket in the Berkshire League and Sunday Friendlies. In 2013, Crowthorne CC fielded two Saturday teams for the first time, along with a Sunday Team and a Midweek T20 team, while Crown Wood CC fielded two League teams and a youth set-up. The 1st XI gained promotion from Division 2 in 2013 after winning the League. Crown Wood&#x27;s existing youth set-up continues under the merged club.

AFC Crowthorne is one of the local football teams that play home games at Morgan Recreation ground.

Crowthorne RFC is a local rugby union club, which has played at New Nest, Lower Broadmoor Road, since its construction in 2019.

==Notable residents==
In order of birth:
*A. C. Benson (1862–1925), essayist and scholar, was born at Wellington College. His father, Edward White Benson, was its first headmaster.
*A. Duncan Carse (1875 or 1876–1938), Artist.
*Frank Sherwood Taylor (1897–1956), museum curator, died here.

<doc id="993943" wikidata="Q17109174" url="?curid=993943" title="1981 Manitoba general election">
<text>The 1981 Manitoba general election was held on November 17, 1981 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was won by the opposition New Democratic Party, which took 34 of 57 seats. The governing Progressive Conservative Party took the remaining 23, while the Manitoba Liberal Party was shut out from the legislature for the only time in its history. The newly formed Progressive Party failed to win any seats.

Sterling Lyon&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government ran on a promise to continue investing in the province&#x27;s &quot;mega-projects&quot; (including as a $500 million Alcan aluminum smelter, a $600 million potash mine and a &quot;Western power grid&quot;), and suggested that an NDP government would jeopardize these plans. The NDP campaign, which was largely co-ordinated by Wilson Parasiuk, questioned the Lyon government&#x27;s fiscal accountability in such matters, noting that it had sold 50% of Trout Lake Copper Mine stock, possibly at a major loss. Jacques Bougie, the Alcan administrator for Manitoba, was also described as holding undue influence over the government.

The NDP campaign generally focused on the economy, and drew attention to the issue of Manitobans emigrating from the province because of job losses. Progressive Party leader Sidney Green described Lyon&#x27;s initiatives as &quot;bega-projects&quot;, a reference to the government&#x27;s controversial fundraising with foreign corporations.

The election was considered too close to call until the final week, when the NDP campaign gained momentum.

==Results==
1 &quot;Before&quot; refers to standings in the Legislature at dissolution, and not to the results of the previous election. These numbers therefore reflect changes in party standings as a result of by-elections and members crossing the floor.

<text>Nathan Jones (born 21 August 1970) is an Australian actor and former professional wrestler. He was signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) between 2002 and 2003. 
He held the WWA World Heavyweight Championship once in World Wrestling All-Stars, and he is best known for aligning himself with The Undertaker in WWE on its SmackDown! brand.

Jones made his film debut in &quot;First Strike&quot; (1996), opposite Jackie Chan. He portrayed Rictus Erectus in &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015) and its 2024 prequel &quot;.&quot; He also appeared in films such as &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), &quot;Tom-Yum-Goong&quot; (2005), &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006), &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (2011), &quot;Hobbs &amp; Shaw&quot; (2019), and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), usually playing antagonists.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. 

Before his career as a wrestler, Jones was sentenced to 16 years in 1987 at the age of 17 to Boggo Road Gaol for eight armed robberies between 1985 and 1987, two of which occurred in Tasmania. During the robberies, he became one of Australia&#x27;s most wanted and ended up serving seven years in a maximum-security prison. In 1994, Jones was given one-year work release before being discharged at the age of 24. While in prison, he was introduced to the sport of powerlifting. He is also alleged to have begun taking steroids during this time. Within a short space of time, he became the National Powerlifting Champion of Australia.

==Strongman career==







Upon his release, Jones also began competing in strongman contests and during this time, he was dubbed &quot;Megaman&quot;. As the reigning Australia&#x27;s Strongest Man, he entered the World Strength Championship at Callander, Scotland, on 29–30 July 1995. He took first place, topping a field that included 1993 World&#x27;s Strongest Man Gary Taylor. The following weekend, he competed in the World Muscle Power Classic held at Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. That contest was won by Magnús Ver Magnússon, with Nathan finishing fifth in a field of twelve competitors.

Jones next took part in the 1995 World&#x27;s Strongest Man contest. After quickly defeating Phil Martin twice in the arm wrestling event in the qualifying heat, Jones was then matched against Magnus Samuelsson, who had been Europe&#x27;s arm wrestling champion for several years and who would become the World&#x27;s Strongest Man in 1998. Samuelsson won the first round. In the second round Jones refused to go down and pulled with his opposite arm, twisting his body. This resulted in breaking the arm he was using to wrestle (a spiral fracture of the humerus), and he subsequently was out of the competition. Jones returned to Strongman competition in 1996, winning the World Strongman Challenge, and placed third in a World&#x27;s Strongest Man qualifying heat behind Magnús Ver Magnússon and Jorma Ojanaho. During the heat, Jones opted to retire from the penultimate event, confidently assuming he would win the last event to get the necessary points to get through to the final, however he placed fourth in the last event and angrily left the playing area, refusing to speak to any competitors or media. 

==Mixed martial arts career==
He also participated in a worked mixed martial arts match at Pride Fighting Championships&#x27;s debut event Pride 1 in October 1997, facing Japanese professional wrestler and former grand sumo champion Koji Kitao. Jones was submitted after being caught in an armlock.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling All-Stars (2001–2002)===
After working as a bodyguard for multimillionaire Rene Rivkin, Jones began a career in wrestling during this time working for Ultimate Pro Wrestling. Jones first gained fame working in World Wrestling All-Stars, making a large impression at the first WWA pay-per-view &quot;Inception&quot;, where he was accompanied to the ring by Rove McManus. However, he was defeated after Rove was smashed with Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s guitar and Jones was hit with the Stroke.

During his time in the WWA, Nathan won the WWA World Heavyweight Championship on 7 April 2002 before losing the belt to Scott Steiner only 5 days later.

===Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max (2002)===
After the title loss, Jones began performing for Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max in June. On 20 October, Jones and Jon Heidenreich defeated Masato Tanaka and Shinjiro Otani to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. On 25 October, Jones and Heidenreich successfully retained the title against Jimmy Snuka Jr. For the 2nd time. and The Predator before losing the title the next day to Naoya Ogawa and Shinya Hashimoto.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2003)===
After Jones initially signed his contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), he was unable to work in the United States because of visa issues stemming from his criminal history. In late 2002 and early 2003, Jones began performing in dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment. He was originally promoted as a &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; type character. On 10 April 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jones made his televised WWE in-ring debut and defeated Bill DeMott.

Upon debuting, Jones&#x27; original character was nixed, and he was put into a storyline with The Undertaker as his protégé and helper during The Undertaker&#x27;s feud with A-Train and Big Show. At WrestleMania XIX, Jones and The Undertaker were scheduled to face Big Show and A-Train in a tag team match, but at the last minute, the match was made a handicap match instead. On screen, Jones was attacked pre-match and left injured. Near the closing moments of the match, Jones reappeared and attacked Big Show, enabling The Undertaker to pin A-Train for the victory. Jones was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) to improve his skills.

Jones was then absent from television for several months until returning in the fall of 2003 as a villain known by the nickname &quot;The Colossus of Boggo Road&quot;, a title referring to his time spent in Boggo Road Gaol. He was paired with Paul Heyman on-screen, with Heyman taking on the role of SmackDown! General Manager. He was also immediately placed into Brock Lesnar&#x27;s Survivor Series team, which also included A-Train, Big Show, and Matt Morgan in order to compete against Lesnar&#x27;s rival Kurt Angle and his team. At Survivor Series, Jones was eliminated by Angle after he submitted to the ankle lock. Team Lesnar was defeated by Team Angle and Jones was then relegated to interfere in Lesnar&#x27;s matches along with the other members of Team Lesnar. He was also placed in matches by either Lesnar or Heyman to aid them. On 6 December 2003, Jones quit the company due to the rigor of WWE&#x27;s heavy travel schedules while on tour in Perth, Australia.

===Post-WWE and retirement===
After leaving WWE, Jones was scheduled to make his pro wrestling return in 2004 at the Australian Wrestling Supershow III, booked against Mark Mercedes. Jones did not appear as advertised and a battle royal was held following an angry shoot promo on Jones by Mercedes and promoter Andy Raymond.

In 2005, he wrestled three matches for World Series Wrestling. On 5 October, he defeated Lee Star and on 7 and 8 October, he defeated Mark Hilton. After his last match with Hilton, Jones immediately retired from wrestling.

In 2008, Jones signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, but nerve damage caused by a cement truck hitting his left arm kept him sidelined for the first three months. He never wrestled for the promotion.

==Acting career==
Following a segment on &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; in which he lifted and pushed an Ute down a street, Jones was contacted by Jackie Chan to be in the film &quot;First Strike&quot;. Eight years later, Jones featured alongside Brad Pitt in the 2004 film &quot;Troy&quot;.

Although he had acted in movies as early as 1996, Jones pursued acting full time following his retirement from wrestling in 2005. In 2015, Jones had a featured role in the film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; as Rictus Erectus. He portrayed the character of Reiko in the 2021 film adaptation of the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. In 2024, Jones would reprise the role of Rictus Erectus in the prequel film &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Citigroup Center (formerly Citicorp Center and also known by its address, 601 Lexington Avenue) is an office skyscraper in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Built in 1977 for Citibank, it is tall and has of office space across 59 floors. The building was designed by architect Hugh Stubbins, associate architect Emery Roth &amp; Sons, and structural engineer William LeMessurier.

The Citigroup Center takes up much of a city block bounded clockwise from the west by Lexington Avenue, 54th Street, Third Avenue, and 53rd Street. Land acquisition took place from 1968 to 1973; St. Peter&#x27;s Church sold its plot on the condition that a new church building be constructed at the base of the tower. The design was announced in July 1973, and the structure was completed in October 1977. Less than a year after completion, the structure had to be strengthened when it was discovered that, due to a design flaw, the building was vulnerable to collapse in high winds. The building was acquired by Boston Properties in 2001, and Citicorp Center was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue in the 2000s. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Citigroup Center as a city landmark in 2016. The building&#x27;s public spaces underwent renovations in 1995 and 2017.

The tower&#x27;s base includes four giant stilts, which are placed mid-wall rather than at the building&#x27;s corners. Its roof is sloped at a 45-degree angle. East of the tower is a six-story office annex. The northwest corner of the tower overhangs St. Peter&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street, a granite structure designed by Stubbins. Also at the base is a sunken plaza, a shopping concourse, and entrances to the church and the New York City Subway&#x27;s Lexington Avenue/51st Street station. The upper stories are supported by stacked load-bearing braces in the form of inverted chevrons. Upon the Citigroup Center&#x27;s completion, it received mixed reviews, as well as architectural awards.

== Site ==
The Citigroup Center is at 601 Lexington Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It takes up the majority of a city block bounded by Lexington Avenue to the west, 54th Street to the north, Third Avenue to the east, and 53rd Street to the south. The land lot covers with a frontage of on Lexington Avenue and a west–east length of . The building shares the block with 880 Third Avenue, an 18-story structure at 53rd Street and Third Avenue. Other nearby buildings include 599 Lexington Avenue to the south, 100 East 53rd Street and the Seagram Building to the southwest, 399 Park Avenue to the west, the Central Synagogue to the northwest, and the Lipstick Building to the east. The New York City Subway&#x27;s Lexington Avenue/51st Street station is directly underneath the building.

Thirty-one parcels were acquired and cleared to make way for the development. The 54th Street frontage was largely occupied by brownstone houses. Some of the other lots contained commercial spaces, ranging from small shops to the upscale Cafe Chauveron. The site also included the Medical Chambers on 54th Street, which was owned by a cooperative of doctors. St. Peter&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church occupied the corner of Lexington Avenue and 54th Street; its sanctuary was rebuilt when the Citigroup Center was developed.

=== Street furniture ===
Custom street furniture—including newsstands, flagpoles, and streetlight pylons—was designed for the sidewalks around the Citigroup Center. New Jersey–based company Designetics designed pylons with a cruciform cross-section and street lamps at the top. Seven lighting pylons are placed along the streets that surround the block. Three custom pylons—at the northwest, northeast, and southwest corners of the block—include pedestrian and vehicular traffic lights. The pylons were initially designed with a &quot;glossy black finish&quot; that contrasted with the tower&#x27;s aluminum facade; by 2016, they had been painted gray. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the pylons in 2017 as &quot;sculptural towers worthy of Brancusi&quot;.

== History ==
First National City Bank (later Citibank) was founded in 1812 and, for over a century, had its headquarters in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The company was headquartered at 52 Wall Street until 1908, when it moved to 55 Wall Street. After National City Bank and the Farmers&#x27; Loan and Trust Company merged in 1929, the new company, City Bank Farmers Trust, moved into a new structure at 20 Exchange Place, which was completed in 1931, and opened a Midtown office at 399 Park Avenue, one block west of the present Citigroup Center, in 1961.

On the northwestern corner of the future Citigroup Center site was St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church, which had been founded in 1862 as a German-speaking congregation. The St. Peter&#x27;s congregation occupied a building at Lexington Avenue and 46th Street from 1871 to 1902, when it was demolished for the construction of Grand Central Terminal. This prompted the congregation to move to a Gothic building designed by John G. Michel and P. Brandner, which was completed in 1905. The congregation, which at its peak had a membership of over one thousand, had decreased to below 300 by the 1960s, prompting the congregation to consider relocating to near the United Nations headquarters.

=== Planning ===

==== Site acquisition ====
Lots on the St. Peter&#x27;s block were acquired secretively starting in 1968 and continued for five and a half years. The acquisition was headed by brokers Donald Schnabel and Charles McArthur of Julien J. Studley Inc. The brokers believed that a large, contiguous land lot would be worth more than the sum of each lot&#x27;s individual worth, though the firm had not yet secured a client for which it was purchasing the lots. St. Peter&#x27;s Church&#x27;s membership was increasing again by then, and members of the congregation were loath to part with their property. A Studley broker formed a company called Lexman, which then approached what had become First National City Bank to determine their interest in acquiring the St. Peter&#x27;s block, one block east of their headquarters at the time. Lexman gradually acquired the other lots on the block.

The brokerage firm again negotiated with St. Peter&#x27;s congregation in late 1969 after some lots had been acquired. John White, president of consulting firm James D. Landauer Associates, proposed that the new structure on the site be a condominium development; i.e. the church would have a partial ownership stake in the new development. In February 1970, the congregation signed a letter of intent to sell its building, as well as the air rights above the church, to First National City Bank. In exchange, the congregation received $9 million and was named as a condominium partner in the tower&#x27;s development. The congregation saw a $4 million net profit, as its new building cost $5 million. Members of the congregation formally approved the sale of their building in May 1971.

Hugh Stubbins &amp; Associates was hired to develop plans for a large building on the city block, and St. Peter&#x27;s Church hired Edward Larrabee Barnes as a design consultant by the beginning of 1971. The Stubbins firm, at the time, had relatively little experience designing high-rise buildings. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the site as an &quot;annex&quot; to First National City Bank&#x27;s main building at 399 Park Avenue. The congregation of St. Peter&#x27;s Church voted in May 1971 to approve the sale of its old building and construct a new structure on the same site, and they relocated in early 1973 to a temporary location at the Central Presbyterian Church. By July 1973, land acquisition was almost entirely complete, although the last parcel was not acquired until November 1975, when the lot at 884 Third Avenue was purchased. The parcels cost $40 million, making it the most expensive city block on earth at the time. The only lot on the block that First National City Bank had not acquired was 880 Third Avenue, which had been completed in 1965, and which the brokers considered too new to be demolished.

==== Design process and city approvals ====
In addition to what became the final design, Stubbins and his associates studied at least six alternate proposals for the tower, with varying rooftop designs. Early plans also called for installing stilts underneath each corner. These plans were scrapped because the northwestern stilt would extend into St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church, and the church wanted its sanctuary to be structurally separate from the tower. Before the official plans for the building were announced, the architects had designed a roof sloped at a 45-degree corner, which was to contain west-facing terraces for about 100 apartments, but the New York City Department of City Planning would not approve a zoning change to permit that use. The architects then rotated the roof southward to accommodate flat-plate solar collectors.

Plans for the project, then known as Citicorp Center, were publicly disclosed on July 24, 1973. The plans called for a tower with stilts under the center of each side, rising above street level. The project would also include an eight-story office annex, three stories of retail, a landscaped public plaza, and a new church building. St. Peter&#x27;s old church building had been demolished by mid-1973, and First National City Bank had become known as Citibank, a subsidiary of Citicorp. St. Peter&#x27;s pastor Ralph E. Peterson described the project as &quot;a very bold venture in an urban environment&quot;. In part because of Peterson&#x27;s insistence, the plans included a publicly accessible plaza with shopping available. Early plans for the church also called for it to have a cube design; the church&#x27;s final design, with a diagonal skylight, was announced in April 1974. The city government approved plans for Citicorp Center the same year.

=== Construction ===
Groundbreaking ceremonies for the tower were hosted in April 1974, but work began only twelve months later. The tower&#x27;s construction was supervised by Vivian Longo, who, at the building&#x27;s completion in 1977, was twenty-five years old. Citicorp Center was one of the few large structures in Manhattan that were being erected in the mid-1970s. At the peak of construction, three thousand people were employed, and 565 workers were on site simultaneously. The steel framework had been completed to the eighteenth floor by the end of 1975. When the frame topped out on October 7, 1976, officials predicted Citicorp Center would be the only major structure in New York City to be completed in 1977.

The cornerstone for the new St. Peter&#x27;s Church was laid on November 1, 1976. Citibank acquired two buildings at 148 and 152 East 53rd Street, immediately south of the new tower, the next month. The company did not intend to develop the sites of these buildings, but they contained topless bars, which Citibank officials perceived would decrease the value of the tower. The bank&#x27;s vice president for real estate management, Arthur E. Driscoll, had studied vacancy rates at fourteen nearby &quot;prime office buildings&quot; while Citicorp Center was being developed. The first tenants moved to the office building in April 1977. By that August, Citicorp Center was 96 percent rented, even though average rents were higher than in other buildings nearby.

=== Early years ===

==== Opening ====
The office tower was dedicated on October 12, 1977. Stubbins gave an opening speech in which he described the building as a &quot;skyscraper for the people&quot;. Almost all the space within the retail complex at the building&#x27;s base, known as the Market, had been rented, and over 300 retailers had applied to operate storefronts in the Market. The majority of the Market&#x27;s space was rented by household furnishings retailer Conran&#x27;s, which occupied , but some of the other retailers included restaurants serving cuisine of various countries. Citibank planned to occupy , or 26 stories, moving its offices to the building from five other addresses in Midtown. The remaining stories were occupied by a variety of firms, including those in law and accounting, as well as the Consulate-General of Japan and technology company IBM.

At the time of Citicorp Center&#x27;s dedication, the final design features of St. Peter&#x27;s Church were being installed. St. Peter&#x27;s Church was dedicated on December 4, 1977, and the Nevelson Chapel was separately dedicated the same month. Initially, the tower&#x27;s slanted roof created an ice problem during winter, as snow and ice would slide down the roof onto the sidewalk. Furthermore, the shopping concourse was initially only lightly used and largely unknown to the public. The plaza on Lexington Avenue opened by July 1978. In the complex&#x27;s early years, St. Peter&#x27;s Church encountered fiscal deficits because of high utility costs, as well as inflation and lack of investment experience, even though the church earned money from renting out some of the other space it owned at Citicorp Center. By 1980, Citicorp counted 25,000 daily visitors to the shopping concourse, but some of the stores had already closed down because of a lack of patronage.

==== 1978 engineering crisis ====
Due to material changes during construction, the building as completed was vulnerable to collapse in high winds. LeMessurier&#x27;s original design for the chevron load braces had used welded joints. To save money, Bethlehem Steel changed the plans in 1974 to use bolted joints, which was accepted by LeMessurier&#x27;s office but not known to the engineer himself. Furthermore, LeMessurier originally only needed to calculate wind loads from perpendicular winds, as required under the building code; in typical buildings, loads from quartering winds at the corners would be less. In June 1978, after an inquiry from engineering student Diane Hartley, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building with quartering winds. LeMessurier found that quartering winds would significantly increase the load at the bolted joints. After conducting tests on the building&#x27;s structural safety, he found that a wind capable of toppling Citicorp Center would have a 1-in-55 chance of occurring in an average year, or a 1-in-16 chance of happening if the tuned mass damper (TMD) on the roof was powered off.

LeMessurier proposed welding steel plates over the bolted joints, and Karl Koch Erecting was hired for the welding process. Starting in August 1978, construction crews installed the welded panels at night. The fixes were completed that October, after which LeMessurier claimed that a wind strong enough to topple the building would have a 1-in-700 chance of occurring in any given year. The work was not publicized at the time, as it took place during the 1978 New York City newspaper strike and very few people were notified of the issue. Since no structural failure occurred, the extent of the engineering crisis was only publicly revealed in a lengthy article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1995. A National Institute of Standards and Technology reassessment of the engineering crisis in 2019, using modern technology, indicated that the quartering wind loads were not as severe as LeMessurier and Hartley had thought.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
As completed, Citicorp Center was divided into three separate condominium-style ownership stakes. One condominium was owned by the church, while the other two were 61.55 and 32.85 percent ownership stakes in the office stories. In October 1987, Citicorp sold the 61.55 percent ownership stake (consisting of the 23rd through 59th floors), along with a one-third stake in its former 399 Park Avenue headquarters, to Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company for $670 million. Citicorp used the profits from the sale to reduce its losses, which in the first half of 1987 totaled $2.32 billion; it continued to own the remaining stories at Citicorp Center. At the time, Citicorp was developing One Court Square across the East River in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. The new building in Queens was one subway stop away from Citicorp Center and 399 Park Avenue, allowing Citicorp to split its offices between the buildings.

The Market shopping atrium fell into disrepair in the two decades following Citicorp Center&#x27;s completion. In May 1995, Citicorp commenced a $15 million, eighteen-month renovation of the shopping concourse, which was designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects. The brick pavers were replaced with terrazzo, new signs were installed outside each storefront, and circulation features, such as the placement of escalators, were rearranged. The shopping concourse was renamed the Shops at Citicorp Center and bookstore Barnes &amp; Noble was named as the anchor tenant, taking .

=== 21st century ===
By late 2000, Dai-Ichi&#x27;s broker Jones Lang LaSalle had placed the entirety of the office building, which had become known as the Citigroup Center, for sale. Dai-Ichi and Citigroup—the latter of which had been formed in 1998 through a merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Companies—arranged to jointly sell both condominium shares. Richard and Eric D. Hadar, a father-and-son venture, bid $725 million for Dai-Ichi&#x27;s ownership stake in January 2001. For the purchase, Eric Hadar had arranged a $525 million first mortgage from Deutsche Bank and a $150 million mezzanine loan from the government of Singapore. The sale was delayed after Boston Properties offered to buy Dai-Ichi&#x27;s stake. Eric Hadar&#x27;s company, Allied Partners, along with Boston Properties, ultimately finalized their purchase of both condominium shares that April. The price was $755 million, including closing costs and taxes, and Citigroup relocated to 399 Park Avenue. One of the stilts was structurally reinforced following the September 11 attacks, and protective bollards were installed on the sidewalk.

Boston Properties bought Allied Partners&#x27; stake in the Citigroup Center in 2006 for $100 million. The same year, Boston Properties began rebranding the building as 601 Lexington Avenue. A new Lexington Avenue lobby was constructed and the tower stories&#x27; entrance was relocated from 53rd Street to Lexington Avenue. In addition, a ramp was installed on 53rd Street and a reception area was added to the northern entrance of St. Peter&#x27;s Church. The name change took effect in 2010. Boston Properties was also considering selling naming rights to the building. By 2013, Citigroup only occupied three stories at the Citigroup Center. The next year, Boston Properties sold a 45 percent ownership stake in the Citigroup Center, along with proportional stakes in the Atlantic Wharf Office Building and 100 Federal Street in Boston, to companies associated with Norges Bank Investment Management. These firms paid a combined $1.5 billion.

In mid-2016, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) proposed protecting twelve buildings in East Midtown, including the Citigroup Center, in advance of proposed changes to the area&#x27;s zoning. At the time, Boston Properties was contemplating renovations to the building; the company filed alteration plans for the plaza that July, and it was vacating the space in the office annex. On December 6, 2016, the LPC designated the Citigroup Center as a city landmark. The designation made the Citigroup Center the city&#x27;s youngest landmark at that time. The same month, Boston Properties announced plans to renovate the office annex, which would be rebranded 159 East 53rd Street. Shortly afterward, in March 2017, Gensler revealed its design for a refurbished entry plaza and a new atrium space. That June, work on the plaza commenced; the original fountain, which had been part of the landmark designation, was demolished. All of the space in the 159 East 53rd Street annex was leased to NYU Langone Health in 2018. Following the completion of the renovation, in late 2019, Anna Castellani signed a lease for a food hall at the base of the Citigroup Center. In October 2019, London-based company etc.venues agreed to operate a conference center on the 14th floor.

In 2021, Boston Properties converted the shopping concourse into a food hall named the Hugh. Boston Properties and Norges Bank Investment Management refinanced the Citigroup Center that December with a $1 billion mortgage from four banks. At the time, the building&#x27;s office space was 96.3 percent occupied, and the tenants largely included financial firms and law offices. With about of space, the Blackstone Group was one of the building&#x27;s largest tenants in 2022. Other large tenants by then included Citibank, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

== Architecture ==
The Citigroup Center consists of the office tower and its annex; there is also a structure for St. Peter&#x27;s Church at the base of the office tower. The tower was designed by architect Hugh Stubbins, along with associate architects Emery Roth &amp; Sons, for the First National City Bank (later Citibank). Of the other principals at Hugh A. Stubbins &amp; Associates, architect Peter Woytuk was most involved in the design, while project manager W. Easley Hammer oversaw the construction. In addition, Edward Larrabee Barnes was the consulting architect, and LeMessurier Associates and James Ruderman were the structural engineers. The general contractor was the HRH Construction Corporation (which was acquired by the Starrett Housing Corporation during the building&#x27;s construction), and the steel contractor was Bethlehem Steel. Numerous contractors supplied other material for the building.

=== Form and facade ===
The Citigroup Center is 59 stories high, with its roof about above ground level. Excluding unused floor numbers accounting for the raised base, it contains 46 office stories. At the time of completion, Citicorp Center was the seventh-tallest building in the world. In addition to the primary 59-story tower, there is an annex at 159 East 53rd Street with six or seven stories. It extends east to Third Avenue and includes part of the building&#x27;s shopping concourse.

The tower and its annex have similarly-designed facades. The facade is made of anodized aluminum and reflective glass panels. Each facade segment measures and consists of both glass panes and aluminum plates. To conserve energy, each window is double-glazed; the inner pane is coated with chrome plating. The windows on each floor are separated by flush aluminum spandrels. The spandrels were manufactured by Flour City Architectural Metals, a firm based in Glen Cove, New York. The aluminum is silver-colored, like that on the Pepsi-Cola Building and One Chase Manhattan Plaza, because Stubbins thought a dark color would not allow observers to &quot;see the shade and shadow&quot;. The facade is fitted with of insulation, double the amount of insulation considered normal at the time of construction. The aluminum was polished to reflect heat from sunlight.

==== Roof ====
The triangular roof of the Citigroup Center rises above the top story and faces south, sloping at a 45-degree angle. The roof was originally intended to face west and contain several terraces, but the architects rotated the roof southward to accommodate flat-plate solar collectors, which they believed would produce hot water that could dehumidify air and reduce the need for other energy for cooling. Starting in February 1975, engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a twelve-month feasibility study for the installation of such a system. Afterward, the system was scrapped, either because of the smaller-than-expected savings, the cost of the required refined mechanical systems, supplier issues, or the insufficient energy produced by the system.

Even after the solar-collector plans were scrapped, the design was kept; Stubbins wrote that the roof &quot;relieves the uniformity of flat-topped towers proliferating in the center of the city&quot;. This made Citicorp Center the first postmodern skyscraper in New York City with an entirely decorative roof. The roof was also fitted with solar panels in 1983, when Consolidated Edison and Citibank sponsored a four-year solar panel test.

=== Plaza ===
A large plaza, beneath street level, was designed by landscape architect Sasaki Associates and built along with Citicorp Center. The plaza&#x27;s presence was encouraged by the 1961 Zoning Resolution, which gave additional floor area to New York City developers as a zoning &quot;bonus&quot; for including open space outside their buildings. While many developers took advantage of the &quot;bonus&quot;, the New York City Planning Commission found in 1975 that many of these plazas ranged from &quot;bleak, forlorn places&quot; to those that were &quot;forbidding and downright hostile&quot;. In response, the City Planning Commission&#x27;s Urban Design Group was formed in 1967 to determine how to improve plaza designs, influencing a design handbook that the City Planning Commission published in 1975. The design of the Citigroup Center&#x27;s plaza was finalized in 1973, and it included many of the same features described in the handbook, such as an outdoor plaza, a covered pedestrian area, and an arcade running for a city block.

The plaza has an area of . Under the zoning laws, its presence allowed the tower to be designed with a maximum floor area ratio of 18:1, higher than the 15:1 ratio specified for the area. The plaza is accessed by a diagonally-oriented stairway extending northeast from the corner of Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street. On the south side of the plaza is an entrance to the Lexington Avenue/51st Street subway station. The Citigroup Center&#x27;s entrance replaces two previous subway entrances on the sidewalk. The north side of the plaza contains the entrance to St. Peter&#x27;s Church. During the plaza&#x27;s construction, the developers collaborated with the numerous public agencies that had a stake in the project, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operated the subway station.

The plaza, interior shopping concourse, and sidewalks all initially contained brown brick floor pavers. There was, originally, also a fountain at the center of the plaza, which was designed to conceal noise from the environs, similar to the fountain at nearby Paley Park. That fountain was demolished in 2017.

==== St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church ====

At the northwest corner of Citigroup Center is St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church at 619 Lexington Avenue. The exterior was designed by Stubbins and Hammer, while the interior was furnished by Vignelli Associates. The church&#x27;s congregation permitted Citicorp to erect the office tower only if an edifice, structurally unconnected to the tower, were built at the same location as the congregation&#x27;s old building. Andrew Alpern and Seymour Durst characterized the agreement as &quot;ecumenically joining God and mammon to the benefit of both&quot;. In addition, at least 63 percent of the church was to have &quot;nothing built above it&quot;. According to Stubbins, the lack of structural connections would give the church a &quot;breathing space&quot; of its own. The church was described by the architectural writer David W. Dunlap in 2004 as the city&#x27;s &quot;most architecturally successful postwar sanctuary&quot;.

The structure rises about above ground and above the Citigroup Center&#x27;s plaza. It has a facade of brown Caledonia granite interspersed with ashlar. The roof is clad in copper that is coated with lead. The materials were meant to establish a distinct identity for the church while also associating it with the office tower. At the top of the church building, a skylight bisects it from southwest to northeast, allowing passersby to look inside. A window at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 54th Street also overlooks the pipe organ inside. Stubbins had intended the structure&#x27;s shape to resemble a pair of hands &quot;held up in prayer with light coming between them&quot;. Arnaldo Pomodoro designed a bronze cross for the exterior, which was installed in 1982 and measures tall by wide.

The church&#x27;s main sanctuary is adjacent to the lower plaza and is about beneath the plaza. The sanctuary has movable pews that can seat up to 850 people. There was also a black-box theater, a library, kitchen, daycare center, clergy offices, dressing rooms, choir rooms, and lecture and community rooms. Upon the church&#x27;s completion, there was a two-manual, two-pedal organ with 2,175 pipes. Inside the church is the 24-seat Chapel of the Good Shepherd (also known as the Nevelson Chapel), which was donated by parishioner Erol Beker and designed by sculptor Louise Nevelson. The basement theater was used by the York Theatre. St. Peter&#x27;s Church also hosts a jazz ministry created by the Rev. John Garcia Gensel, who in 1965 became the Minister to the Jazz Community. The jazz ministry has sponsored several programs over the years, such as free jazz performances at the base of the office tower. The church has hosted memorials and funerals for jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. In 2021, the church was seriously damaged after a broken water main flooded its space.

=== Structural features ===
The tower stories are of trussed-tube construction. Each of the tower stories measures , or in total. Within the office stories, the elevator shafts and emergency stairs are embedded in a service core at the center of each story. The core is about , while the floor space around the core is just less than wide. Overall, the Citigroup Center is made of of steel, two-fifths of the amount used in the Empire State Building.

==== Stilts ====
The tower is supported by four stilts measuring approximately high with a cross section of . The stilts are underneath the centers of each elevation of the facade, and the building&#x27;s corners are cantilevered outward from the core. According to Stanley Goldstein of LeMessurier&#x27;s New York City office, stilts at the centers of each elevation would be able to withstand forces from &quot;quartering winds&quot; from the corners, compared to stilts at the corners. Additionally, the stilts allowed the building to have a smaller foundation than in a conventional building of similar size.

Each of the individual stilts is composed of four vertical beams; the outer pairs of beams are much heavier than the inner pairs. This design prevents the stilt from buckling. Inside the stilts are emergency stairs and mechanical ducts. In 2002, following the September 11 attacks the previous year, one of the stilts was reinforced with blast-resistant shields of steel and copper as well as steel bracing. There is also an octagonal elevator core in the middle of the building, which measures and carries half of the building&#x27;s gravity-related structural loads. Beneath the lowest office story, the core contains only elevators, and the emergency staircases are within the stilts.

==== Chevrons ====
Above the stilts, within the walls, are stacked load-bearing braces in the form of inverted chevrons. Each elevation of the facade has six chevrons, which are eight stories tall. The wind loads from each eight-story tier are transferred into the center of the frame, where &quot;mast column transports&quot; extend the tower&#x27;s entire height. The mast columns are deep at their bases, tapering to above the 40th floor. The diagonal beams in each chevron are deep and connect to spandrel panels at the top of each eight-story tier, which are deep. The tops of each eight-story tier (where the diagonal beams meet the building&#x27;s corners) do not have vertical columns, thus preventing wind loads from accumulating at the tower&#x27;s corners.

The ninth story, the lowest level above the stilts, contains a trussed frame similar to those use in cantilever bridges, where the wind loads are transferred downward into the stilts. This story is used as mechanical space.

The chevrons are not visible from the exterior but can be seen from the offices inside; this contrasted with structures such as Chicago&#x27;s John Hancock Center in which the diagonal beams could be seen from the outside. After Citicorp Center&#x27;s completion, W. Easley Hammer said he thought it was a mistake to conceal the chevrons, while LeMessurier said that Stubbins had rejected his idea for exposed chevrons. The chevrons were originally bolted to each other with over two hundred joints. Following the Citicorp Center engineering crisis of 1978, workers installed steel plates over each joint.

=== Interior ===
The tower contains approximately of rentable space. The office annex to the east contains about of space. According to the Department of City Planning, the building has a gross floor area of , while, according to The Skyscraper Center, the building has .

==== Base ====
The Citigroup Center&#x27;s main entrance lobby is at the middle of the Lexington Avenue frontage, across a footbridge that also provides entrance to St. Peter&#x27;s Church. The main entrance consists of a double-height glass box, with steel ribs, that is long. The lobby was constructed as part of a 2010 renovation.

There is a three-story shopping concourse at the base of the stilts, originally called the Market. The lowest level, corresponding to the lower lobby, includes a plant-filled atrium measuring high, with a skylight measuring . The corner of Third Avenue and 54th Street contained an entrance to the lowest level of the shopping concourse, while on 54th Street was an entrance to the second level. The storefronts were designed to blend in with the plaza and street, with similar floor surfaces and transparent exterior walls. Overall, the stores were intended as a commitment to the city, a corporate symbol, and a tourist attraction, according to one of Citicorp&#x27;s vice presidents, Arthur E. Driscoll. From 1987 to 2008, the bank presented a model train exhibition in the space each December. The shopping concourse was renamed The Shops at Citicorp Center in 1995, and it was known as the Atrium by 2016.

==== Mechanical features ====
In the office stories, the elevators and stairs are clustered in a central core. The building contains 20 double-deck elevators, which Otis Worldwide constructed for $7 million. Although each of the upper or lower decks serves only odd or even floors, visitors can travel between odd and even floors using escalators. Each of the elevators consists of two standard elevator cabs that operate simultaneously in one shaft. The elevators cost 25 percent more than standard elevators but allowed for a 24 percent reduction in the floor area taken up by elevators, as twenty-six single-deck elevator shafts would have been required otherwise. The Citigroup Center&#x27;s double-deck elevators were likely the first to be installed in New York City since 1932, when the Cities Service Building was completed. In total, the Citigroup Center has 38 elevators.

At Citicorp Center&#x27;s completion, a &quot;supermail&quot; system delivered each tenant&#x27;s mail. Incoming mail was sorted in the basement and transferred via lifts to each floor, where the mail was transported manually to fixed bins. The building also contained 2,500 sensors to monitor the mechanical systems, such as HVAC, lighting, electrical, sprinkler, life-safety, security, and elevator systems. The sloped roof houses mechanical equipment.

The building was intended to be energy-efficient compared to its contemporaries. Its water supply consisted entirely of cold water; heat from the building&#x27;s mechanical systems was recirculated to warm the water and the office spaces. The office spaces were cooled with outside air wherever it was practical. The fluorescent light bars in the ceiling, manufactured by Joseph Loring &amp; Associates, were fitted with glass shields to spread artificial light across a wider area. Even though the rooftop solar collectors were not installed, the other features were intended to reduce energy use by up to 42 percent, compared with a regular office building of the same size. During the summer, the building used a conventional air-conditioning system, offsetting any energy saved by the heat-deflecting facade.

Citicorp Center was the city&#x27;s first skyscraper to feature a tuned mass damper. Located within the rooftop mechanical space, the TMD is designed to counteract swaying motions due to wind and reduces wind-related movement by up to fifty percent. The equipment weighs and includes a concrete block measuring . The block sits on an oil-coated steel plate and has two spring mechanisms, one each to counteract north–south and east–west movement. The equipment cost around $1.5 million to install. By comparison, it would have cost $5 million to reduce the tower&#x27;s movement by adding of additional steel.

=== Reception ===
As one of three office buildings approved in Manhattan during 1974, Citicorp Center received much media attention during its construction. After the design was announced, the architectural writer Ada Louise Huxtable criticized the design in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying that the tower &quot;has neither romanticism nor structural rationalism but, instead, appears to have been painstakingly invented with a tortured logic through a series of pragmatic and esthetic compromises&quot;. As the building was being completed, Huxtable took a less harsh tone, saying that it contained a &quot;clear desire for design quality&quot; despite the drawbacks of the form and roof. A writer for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described the building as being a typical New York City office structure that would only attract notice if it were built elsewhere. A &quot;New York&quot; magazine writer, Suzanne Stephens, stated that the building was simply a modified version of a 1950s skyscraper, considering the rooftop and base to be wasteful with space.

After the building&#x27;s completion, it had mixed reception. The architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the roof was unusual and that the building had a reflective facade and a varied form, but that the overall design was not particularly innovative. Another architectural critic, Jack Egan, similarly wrote for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the building had distinctive design features but did not appeal to either nostalgia or novel innovation. Huxtable regarded the plaza as an architectural success but observed in January 1978 that very few people used it. August Heckscher II, a former New York City parks commissioner, described the interior as &quot;an amenity in which we can all rejoice&quot;. Nevertheless, Heckscher believed the atrium&#x27;s silver cladding and light fixtures to be unwelcoming and suggestive of the indoors, and Stephens said that the benefits of the atrium did not transcend class boundaries.

Other critics described Citicorp Center in a largely positive light. The historian and writer John Tauranac described the tower as the &quot;most dramatic new skyscraper&quot; in New York City since the completion of 30 Rockefeller Plaza several decades prior. The architect and writer Robert A. M. Stern said Citicorp Center was the summation of the &quot;unique architectural and urbanistic character that made Fifty-third Street at once an enclave within midtown and a microcosm of midtown itself&quot;. The urbanist and sociologist William H. Whyte spoke positively of the structure for its juxtaposition of design elements, such as the exterior plaza and sidewalk. The building was also praised by publications outside the New York City area. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described the building as being simultaneously sophisticated and simple-looking, while &quot;The Observer&quot; of London wrote that the building was a &quot;unique contribution&quot; to the skyline of Manhattan&#x27;s East Side.

=== Awards and use as icon ===
Upon Citicorp Center&#x27;s completion, it received several architectural awards. In 1978, the City Club of New York gave the building a Bard Award, which recognized &quot;excellence in architecture and urban design&quot;. The same year, the American Institute of Steel Construction gave its Architectural Award of Excellence to Citicorp for the building&#x27;s design. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) gave Citicorp an Honor Award in 1979, and Hugh Stubbins and Associates received the AIA&#x27;s R.S. Reynolds Memorial Award in 1981 for using aluminum in Citicorp Center&#x27;s design. The AIA&#x27;s 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Citigroup Center among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

The sloped roof of the building has been used for branding purposes. For instance, it is included on the label of Chock full o&#x27;Nuts coffee. In addition, the top left corner of the first &quot;M&quot; in Manhattan Mini Storage&#x27;s logo was sloped to resemble the Citigroup Center&#x27;s roof.

<text>The is a type of traditionally made Japanese sword (&quot;nihontō&quot;) with an extra long handle, used by the samurai class of feudal Japan.

==History==
It is possible that nagamaki were first produced during the Heian period (794 to 1185) but there are no known examples dating from before the mid Kamakura period (1192–1333). The nagamaki is believed to have been developed from the . The , with its long blade, was sometimes too long to be used with a standard length hilt. Therefore, a strong cord would sometimes be wrapped around the sword from the center of the blade to the , and the user would hold the sword by that part of the cord. The sword used in this way was called . It is believed that this usage evolved into the nagamaki, in which the hilt was lengthened during the manufacturing process.

In the Sengoku period, as the battlefield changed to a tactic where foot soldiers called fought on a large scale in dense formations with and , , which were difficult to use in dense formations, were replaced by nagamaki, and heavy and long were often replaced by .
During the Sengoku period the nagamaki reached its peak of usage. It was generally used as a weapon for low-ranking soldiers who fought on foot. The historical book mentions that nagamaki were lent to low-ranking soldiers who could not handle the well. The famed warlord Uesugi Kenshin, of Echigo Province, is said to have had a special guard of retainers armed with nagamaki.

In the Edo period (1603–1867), the hilts of nagamaki were often cut off and made into or . This practice of cutting off the hilt of a or or or nagamaki and remaking it into a shorter or due to changes in tactics is called and was common in Japan at the time.

In Japan there is a saying about swords: &quot;No sword made by modifying a nagamaki or a is dull in cutting&quot; (長巻（薙刀）直しに鈍刀なし). The meaning of this saying is that nagamaki and are equipment for actual combat, not works of art or offerings to the , and that the sharpness and durability of swords made from their modifications have been proven on the battlefield.

==Description==
The nagamaki was a long sword with a blade that could be or more and a handle of about equal length to the blade.
The blade was single-edged, resembling a naginata blade, but the handle (&quot;tsuka&quot;) of the nagamaki was not a smooth-surfaced wooden shaft as in the naginata; it was made more like a katana hilt. Even the name &quot;nagamaki&quot; (&quot;long wrapping&quot;) is given by the tradition of handle wrapping. The nagamaki&#x27;s handle was wrapped with leather or silk cords in criss-crossed manner, very similar to that of a katana&#x27;s. The nagamaki is considered to be evolved from the extremely long &quot;ōdachi&quot; or &quot;nodachi&quot; swords that are described in fourteenth century literature and pictorial sources.

The length of blade varies on a nagamaki. However, the &quot;nagasa&quot; (blade length) most commonly fits the profile of a &quot;tachi&quot; or katana blade, which would be a blade of more than 2 &quot;shaku&quot; (2 Shaku = ) in length. While nagamaki means &quot;long wrap&quot;, there have been specimens found with no wrapping cord at all, which is very much like a long &quot;tachi&quot; handle. The &quot;tsukamaki&quot; (hilt wrap) is of even more importance when applied to the hilt. The cord helps to improve grip on the hilt and also lends structural integrity to the wooden handle. Nagamaki found without hilt wraps usually had at least metal collars around the hilt where the tang is.

There are no solid rules governing the aspects of the make of the nagamaki. Unlike the wakizashi, tantō, and katana, which have had history of strict measurements regarding the blade length and even the hilt in some cases; the nagamaki varied in blade length, tang length, &quot;kissaki&quot; style, etc. Nagamaki presumably could have &quot;koshirae&quot; in a &quot;tachi&quot; or &quot;katana&quot; style as well as a nagamaki style, however there are examples of nagamaki with rather long tangs, which could be fitted with a longer haft and effectively function as a naginata. Araki-ryū nagamaki is a heavy naginata over in weight and in length.

All traditional Japanese swords are fitted very snugly to their hilts and held in place with a &quot;mekugi&quot;, a bamboo peg which is fit through a hole in the tang called a &quot;mekugi-ana&quot;. This is actually quite a strong mount when done correctly, and allowed for easy dismount of the bare blade for maintenance or inspection. Katana most commonly had one single pin, and nagamaki commonly have been found with two or more to account for the added leverage of a longer handle.

==Use==
Wielding is very specific; it is held with two hands in a fixed position in the same way a katana is held. Unlike the &quot;naginata&quot;, the hands do not change when handling the weapon and the right hand was always the closest to the blade. While handling nagamaki fewer sliding actions on the handle are performed than are with the &quot;naginata&quot;, where the entire length of the shaft is used. The nagamaki is designed for large sweeping and slicing strokes. Traditionally the nagamaki was used as an infantry weapon, frequently used against cavalry.

==In fiction==
*Tatsugiri, signature nagamaki wields by Kuryuu Ango in 2000s &quot;Gamaran&quot; manga. 
*Sir Alonne, a boss encountered in the &quot;Dark Souls II&quot; DLC campaign &quot;Crown of the Old Iron King&quot;, is a samurai-esque character who wields a nagamaki. He will commit seppuku with the nagamaki should the player defeat him under 5 minutes without taking damage.
*Lyon, a supporting character in the fifth &quot;Suikoden&quot; game, wields a nagamaki to protect her charge, the Prince of Falena, who is the protagonist.
*In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the Elves are shown using a curved, single-edged sword very similar to the nagamaki, except for a subtle S-shape.
* In the anime called &quot;Tensei Shitara Suraimu Datta Ken&quot;, the red-haired warrior Hiiro wields a nagamaki sword.
*Corrupted Monk, a boss encountered in the game &quot;  Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice &quot; wields a huge nagamaki and performs elaborate swipe and swing attacks on the player.
*In &quot;  Samurai Shodown  &quot; (2019), newcomer Yashamaru Kurama wields a nagamaki; currently the only character in the series to wield one.

<text>A parallel study is a type of clinical study where two groups of treatments, A and B, are given so that one group receives only A while another group receives only B. Other names for this type of study include &quot;between patient&quot; and &quot;non-crossover&quot;. This is unlike a crossover study where at first one group receives treatment A and later followed by treatment B while the other group receives treatment B followed by treatment A. There are, however, certain characteristics that allow for differentiation between these two types of trials. For example, a parallel study would be more appropriate if any concerns about carryover effects were present. This type of study might also be more beneficial if the disease or disorder being studied has a likely chance of progression during the time in which the study takes place. One significant issue with parallel studies, though, is the concept of intra subject variability, which is defined as variability in response occurring within the same patient.

The two treatment groups in a parallel study can either consist of two completely separate treatments (i.e. different drugs), or simply different doses of a common drug. One major aspect of a parallel study is randomization – this ensures that the results are accurate and have a lower risk of being biased. Control groups utilizing a placebo, or active control, are often used in this type of study.

<doc id="993976" wikidata="Q17070759" url="?curid=993976" title="National Income and Product Accounts">
<text>The national income and product accounts (NIPA) are part of the national accounts of the United States. They are produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce. They are one of the main sources of data on general economic activity in the United States.

They use double-entry accounting to report the monetary value and sources of output produced in the country and the distribution of incomes that production generates. Data are available at the national and industry levels.

Seven summary accounts are published, as well as a much larger number of more specific accounts. The first summary account shows the gross domestic product (GDP) and its major components.
The table summarizes national income on the left (debit, revenue) side and national product on the right (credit, expense) side of a two-column accounting report. Thus the left side gives GDP by the income method, and the right side gives GDP by the expenditure method.
The GDP is given on the bottom line of both sides of the report. GDP must have the same value on both sides of the account. This is because income and expenditure are defined in a way that forces them to be equal (see accounting identity). We show the 2003 table later in this article; we present the left side first for a convenient screen display.

The U.S. report (updated quarterly) is available in several forms, including interactive, from links on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) NIPA () page. Other countries report based on their own adopted system of National accounts which are frequently based on the U.S. NIPAs, the widely adopted United Nations System of National Accounts, or their own custom approach. The level of detail (granularity) accounted for internally, and reported publicly, varies widely across countries. Likewise, a nation&#x27;s system of accounts, (analogous to a firm&#x27;s Chart of accounts) are typically gradually revised and updated on their own individual schedule. The U.S. NIPAs are prepared by the staff of the Directorate for National Economic Accounts within the BEA. The source data largely originates from public sources, such as government surveys and administrative data, and they are supplemented by data from private sources, such as data from trade associations (BEA 2008: 1–6).

==Income accounting==
The income side of the national income and product account report begins with the kinds of income people might have. Employee compensation includes the wages and salaries paid to anyone whose income is subject to income tax withholding. Since wages and salaries affect more individuals and families directly than the other sources of income, it has by far the largest value.

Proprietors&#x27; income is the payments to those who own non-corporate businesses, including sole proprietors and partners. inventory value adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCA) are corrections for changes in the value of the proprietor&#x27;s inventory (goods that may be sold within one year) and capital (goods like machines and buildings that are not expected to be sold within one year) under rules set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Rental income of persons excludes rent paid to corporate real estate companies. Real estate is capital rather than an inventory by definition, so there is no IVA.

Corporate profits with IVA and CCA are like the entries for proprietors&#x27; income and rental income except that the organization is a corporation. Corporate profit is shown before taxes, which are part of taxes on production and imports, two lines down.

Business current transfer payments are not explained here.

Net interest and miscellaneous payments are interest paid minus interest received plus payments to individuals and corporations that are not elsewhere classified (NEC). Taxes on production and imports does not include corporate income tax payments to the states and to the federal government. Taxes on production and imports were previously classified as &quot;indirect business taxes&quot; and included excise taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and other taxes relating to business production. While the report includes the net value of interest payments and receipts, both the taxes paid and subsidies from the government are shown.

National income (NI) is the sum of employees, proprietors, rental, corporate, interest, and government income less the subsidies government pays to any of those groups.

Net national product (NNP) is National Income plus or minus the statistical discrepancy that accumulates when aggregating data from millions of individual reports. In this case, the statistical discrepancy is US$25.6 billion, or about 0.23% of the gross domestic product. A discrepancy that small (less than three-tenths of one percent) is immaterial under accounting standards.

Gross national product is net national product plus an allowance for the consumption of fixed capital, mostly buildings and machines, usually called depreciation. Capital is used up in production but it does not vanish.

Finally, GDP is gross national product plus payments from the rest of the world that are income to residents of the U.S. minus payments from the US to the rest of the world that count as income where they are received.

==Production accounting==
Macroeconomics defines GDP, from the production perspective, as the sum of personal consumption, investment, net exports, and government expenditures; .

The production side report also begins with individuals and families, in this case, their personal consumption expenditures on goods and services, C in the definition. Durable goods are expected to last more than a year (furniture, appliances, cars, etc.) and to have little or no secondary resale market. Nondurable goods are used up within a year (food, clothing, medicine ...). Services include everything else, everything we buy that has little or no physical presence, like banking, health care, insurance, movie tickets, and so on.

Gross private domestic investment includes expenditures on goods that are expected to be used for an extended period of time, I in the definition. Residential investment includes owner-occupied and rental housing. Nonresidential investment includes buildings, machinery, and equipment used for commercial or industrial purposes (small business, agriculture, manufacturing, service, etc.). The last element of Investment accounts for any change in the value of previous investments that are still in use, called inventory.

Net Exports reports the balance between goods produced domestically but consumed abroad (X) and goods produced abroad but consumed domestically (M). There is no distinction between consumption and investment or between the private and public sectors; a consumer&#x27;s imported television, a corporation&#x27;s imported lab equipment, and the government&#x27;s use of imported food on military bases count equally. When net exports are positive, the country has a trade surplus. When Net Exports are negative, there is a trade deficit.

Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment includes all government expenditures on domestically produced goods and services. Like an individual or family, the government consumes food, clothing, furniture, and other goods and services in its administrative, military, correctional, and other programs. Governments also invest in buildings for program use and in improvements to harbors, rivers, roads, and airports. Transfer payments, like subsidies to the unemployed or the retired, are &quot;not&quot; included in this item since they are simply a movement of money from the government to citizens, rather than a purchase of goods or services.

The sum of the four production categories is a gross domestic product, the value of all domestic expenditures on goods and services. GDP (income) must equal GDP (production) except for any rounding error that accumulates when the data used to prepare a table includes rounding at prior stages of analysis, as appears to have happened in this case.

<text>Brian David Kendrick (born May 29, 1979) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure in WWE. He is also known for his time in Ring of Honor (ROH), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), and Pro Wrestling Zero1 (Zero1).

Kendrick began his career in 1999. During the early years of his career, Kendrick wrestled as Leonardo Spanky or simply Spanky for several small American promotions like ROH and TNA and for Japanese promotions like Zero1, where he won the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship and Zero-One United States Openweight Championship. In the early 2000s, he also had two stints with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later World Wrestling Entertainment), one as a developmental wrestler and a second stint where he appeared as part of the main roster before departing. He would make his return to WWE in 2005, where he was paired with Paul London. During his time as a tag team, they would win the World Tag Team Championship and the WWE Tag Team Championship, with the latter becoming the longest reign of the title until 2016. After the team was dissolved, he began a singles career as The Brian Kendrick, with Ezekiel Jackson as his enforcer. He would leave WWE in 2009. The next year, Kendrick would make his return to TNA, where he stayed for two years, winning the TNA X Division Championship. He also worked until 2016 on the independent circuit and toured occasionally with NJPW.

In 2014, Kendrick began to work with WWE as a trainer. He would make his return to the ring during the 2016 Cruiserweight Classic, a tournament held by WWE for cruiserweight wrestlers. Despite not winning the tournament, Kendrick was assigned to 205 Live, a newly created cruiserweight brand, where he would capture the WWE Cruiserweight Championship once. During the following years, Kendrick worked on both the &quot;205 Live&quot; and &quot;NXT UK&quot; programs, until he began to work as a backstage producer for the NXT brand.

Kendrick is also a promoter. He currently owns and operates his own promotion, called Brian Kendrick&#x27;s Wrestling Pro Wrestling, as well as a professional wrestling trainer at Pro Wrestling Unpluggeds Kayfabe college

==Early life==
Kendrick was born in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, and is the son of Barbara Kendrick and the oldest of three children—a brother named Neal and a sister named Shannon. He later moved to Olympia, Washington where he attended North Thurston High School in Lacey, Washington. During his senior year, he worked as a dishwasher at Dirty Dave&#x27;s Pizza Parlor while saving money to attend wrestling school.

While growing up, Kendrick&#x27;s favorite wrestlers included Ultimate Warrior, Blue Blazer and Koko B. Ware. He was also a fan of Shawn Michaels, who trained him, and Chris Jericho. He was already very good friends with his former tag team partner Paul London, with Lance Cade and Bryan Danielson, both of whom he trained with.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1999–2002)===
In 1999, he moved to Texas to begin training at the NWA Southwest wrestling school and later attended the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy. It was there that Kendrick adopted the ring name Spanky, a nickname he was given due to his method of staying awake during long drives on the indy circuit. He made his professional wrestling debut on October 8, 1999, in a match with American Dragon that ended in a 10-minute time limit draw.
In October 2001, Kendrick wrestled American Dragon in the first round of The King of the Indies tournament, but lost. The crowd, however, gave both men a standing ovation after the match.

===Memphis Championship Wrestling (2000–2001)===
In February 2000, Kendrick signed a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), spending a year in the company&#x27;s &quot;farm territory&quot;, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), before the promotion closed and Kendrick was released from his contract. Kendrick won his first Championship in MCW when he defeated American Dragon for the MCW Southern Light Heavyweight Championship on September 22. He later teamed with American Dragon to win the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship, on December 1, becoming a double champion. The tag team disbanded after they lost the Championships to The Dupps. On December 30, however, the Southern Light Heavyweight title was declared vacant after a match that Kendrick had with Derrick King. In a match for the vacant championship, Kendrick regained the title after beating King, on January 6, 2001. He later dropped it to Tyler Gates, before regaining it on May 11. On June 1, however, Spanky was stripped of the title and it was abandoned, making Spanky the last ever MCW Southern Light Heavyweight Champion. He also holds the record for most reigns, with three.

===Ring of Honor, Japan and various promotions (2002)===
On February 23, 2002, Kendrick wrestled on the premiere show of Ring of Honor (ROH), winning the match to gain an ROH contract. While in ROH, Kendrick competed in several other promotions such as Heartland Wrestling Association and All Pro Wrestling, before leaving for Japan in June to compete in Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero-One). There, he wrestled under the ring name Leonardo Spanky, a gimmick proposed by Shinya Hashimoto due to Kendrick&#x27;s resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio. On June 29, he became the first International Junior Heavyweight Champion in company history. He dropped the title to Low Ki a few months later.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2004) ===
In late 2002, Kendrick signed a contract with WWE, but was unable to compete until he completed his time in the independent circuit. He made his WWE debut on the edition of January 11, 2003, of &quot;Velocity&quot; under the gimmick of a mascot representing the local sports team of the town in which he was competing. He continued wearing masks for several weeks, each time competing under a different identity. After acting as a telegram deliverer for Big Show to Undertaker, and getting a Last Ride for his troubles, he showed up the following week and began a series of events trying to impress the then General Manager of Smackdown! Stephanie McMahon in order to earn a contract for the WWE, including trying to last five minutes in a match with Kurt Angle. He eventually earned himself a contract on the March 20, 2003, episode of Smackdown! by defeating Shannon Moore. His first major storyline within WWE came on the May 1, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He reverted to his former &quot;Spanky&quot; ring name after he interrupted a promo by John Cena. The two feuded over their similar hip hop gimmicks, until May 22. On October 30, Spanky began teaming with Paul London until January 13, 2004, when Kendrick left WWE to return to Zero1.

===Independent circuit (2004–2005)===
After leaving WWE, Kendrick wrestled in different independent promotions. He returned to Pro Wrestling Zero1 as &quot;Spanky&quot; and was quickly pushed to capture the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship. This occurred with partner Low Ki on February 19, 2004, when they defeated Dick Togo and Ikuto Hidaka. They lost the championship to Tatsuhito Takaiwa and Tomohiro Ishii a few months later. Kendrick gained a new tag team partner in Kaz Hayashi, on September 19, 2004, and won back the championships. They held onto the titles until March 2005, when they dropped them to Hidaka and Minoru Fujita. Although he lost the tag titles in March, Kendrick, as Spanky, received a singles push, and won the Zero-One United States Openweight Championship that same month. but he lost the title in September 2005.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004)===
Kendrick had a brief stint in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in November 2004 under the ring name &quot;Spanky&quot; on the November 4 episode of &quot;Impact&quot; where he defeated Kaz, Matt Sydal and Amazing Red, in a four-way match. At TNA&#x27;s first monthly three-hour PPV event Victory Road, Spanky competed in a 20-man X-Division Gauntlet match for the X Division Cup the match was won by Héctor Garza.

===Return to ROH (2004–2005)===
He then returned to ROH, as well as debuting on its sister promotion Full Impact Pro (FIP) on December 17, 2004, winning the first ever Florida Rumble. On February 25, Kendrick wrestled a match against fellow WWE alumnus, James Gibson. Throughout the match, the crowd chanted &quot;Welcome Back!&quot; and &quot;SmackDown! Sucks!&quot;, and both men received a standing ovation after the match. During his time in ROH, Kendrick was booked as a mid-carder, consistently having matches late on the card. Kendrick also competed in the Trios Tournament, but lost in the first round with his team members, Gibson and Nigel McGuinness. He unsuccessfully competed for several titles such as the ROH Pure Championship, ROH World Championship and ROH World Tag Team Championship. In July 2005, Kendrick announced that he had re-signed with World Wrestling Entertainment, and would be returning there after he had fulfilled his obligations on the Independent circuit. In FIP, Kendrick won the FIP Tag Team Championship with Sal Rinauro on August 6, 2005, but lost it to The Heartbreak Express less than a month later, shortly before he returned to WWE.

===Return to WWE (2005–2009)===
====Teaming with Paul London (2005–2008)====

In July 2005, Kendrick announced that after he had fulfilled his obligations on the independent circuit, he would return to WWE. He made his return during a live event on August 22, 2005, losing in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. He then reformed a tag team with his former partner Paul London on the edition of September 30 of &quot;Velocity&quot;. On December 16, the pair remade their image, wearing theatrical masks to the ring with matching vests and shorts. They were quickly elevated into the WWE Tag Team Championship picture, receiving a non-title match against WWE Tag Team Champions MNM on the edition of February 10, 2006, of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which London and Kendrick lost. On April 7, they faced MNM again, picking up a win in a non-title match. Their storyline feud continued, as London and Kendrick continued their winning streak over the champions, including singles victories for both Kendrick and London on MNM members Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, respectively. London and Kendrick won the WWE Tag Team Championship at Judgment Day, thus defeating MNM six times in a row in singles and tag team matches altogether.
Their first main competition for the titles came when K. C. James and Idol Stevens defeated the champions in a non-title match, in early August, igniting a storyline feud between the two teams. During the rivalry, WWE Diva Ashley Massaro began accompanying London and Kendrick to the ring, acting as a valet to the team while combating the actions of James and Stevens&#x27; manager Michelle McCool.

On October 14, London and Kendrick became the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions until 2016, surpassing MNM&#x27;s previous record of 145 days. Despite this, they were still booked as the underdogs in their feuds, and this was shown when they began a losing streak to the team of William Regal and Dave Taylor. Regal defeated both in singles matches and on the December 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kendrick and London lost a non-title tag team match to the duo. London and Kendrick had a scheduled title defense at Armageddon, against Regal and Taylor. Before the pay-per-view, the match changed into a Fatal Four Way tag team ladder match with London and Kendrick defending their titles against Regal and Taylor, MNM, and The Hardys. London and Kendrick won the match and retained the titles.
On February 2, 2007, London and Kendrick suffered a non-title loss to the rookie team Deuce &#x27;n Domino. In a title match at No Way Out, London and Kendrick retained the championship. London and Kendrick, however, dropped the championship to them on the edition of April 20 of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, ending their reign at 331 days (&quot;SmackDown!&quot; was recorded on April 17). In the storyline, London missed a moonsault from the ring apron to the floor during the title match, injuring his ribs, leaving Kendrick to battle Deuce &#x27;n Domino alone. London and Kendrick unsuccessfully competed for the title on June 1 in a triple threat tag team match, which also involved Regal and Taylor, and lost a rematch on June 15 in a standard tag team match.

Kendrick, along with London, was drafted to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007, during the Supplemental Draft. They won their debut match on &quot;Raw&quot; against The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team on June 18. They were soon established as a threat to the tag titles, and on the edition of September 3 of &quot;Raw&quot;, they won a number one contender&#x27;s match for Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch&#x27;s World Tag Team Championship. Kendrick and London then worked a feud with Cade and Murdoch, and at a house show on September 5, they defeated Cade and Murdoch to win the titles, only to lose it back to Cade and Murdoch three days later. London and Kendrick continued to feud with Cade and Murdoch and lost to the Tag Team champions at Unforgiven. For the rest of 2007, London and Kendrick mainly competed on &quot;Heat&quot; or in tag title bouts, until London got injured in late 2007. As a result, Kendrick was mainly used as a jobber on &quot;Raw&quot;, until London returned at the start of February 2008, although Kendrick still won sometimes on &quot;Heat&quot;.

In his next storyline, Kendrick abandoned London during a handicap match with Umaga. This abandonment resulted in Umaga performing the Samoan Spike on London, allowing Umaga to pick up the win over the duo. London and Kendrick still teamed together with no apparent dissension rising between the former tag team champions. After defeating Charlie Haas and Robbie McAllister on &quot;Heat&quot;, London and Kendrick said they were ready to win the World Tag Team Championship. London and Kendrick beat the champions Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes next week on &quot;Heat&quot; in a non-title match. However, they failed to win the World Tag Team Titles on &quot;Raw&quot; after Holly pinned London.

====Championship pursuits (2008–2009)====

As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Kendrick was drafted back to the SmackDown brand while London stayed on Raw, thus ending the team. He made his return to the brand on the July 18, 2008, airing of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, as a heel, with new ring attire, changing his name to The Brian Kendrick and accopained by Ezekiel Jackson. At Unforgiven, he participated in a Scramble match for the WWE Championship, but he didn&#x27;t win the title. He later teamed with Jackson on many occasions, becoming number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship held by Carlito and Primo, but they never managed to win the championship.

On April 15, 2009, Kendrick was separated from Jackson as he was drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft while Jackson was drafted to the ECW brand. He wrestled his return match on &quot;Raw&quot; on the April 27 episode, against Kofi Kingston. He won a match on &quot;Raw&quot; after defeating Carlito on the May 11 episode before declaring his intention to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship; in the following weeks, Kendrick tried several unsuccessful pairings. In his final match, he was defeated by Kofi Kingston while cutting a promo on Jerry Lawler. The match ended with Kendrick turning around into Trouble In Paradise. On July 30, 2009, WWE announced that Kendrick was released from his contract.

===Return to the independent circuit (2009–2016)===

Kendrick signed with Dragon Gate USA on August 6, 2009. His first match for the company, a losing effort against Cima at Untouchable, aired on pay-per-view edited down to only the highlights of the match. On August 28 he made his return to Pro Wrestling Guerrilla at &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; where he, wrestling as a heel, defeated Bryan Danielson after a low blow. Afterwards he formed an alliance with PWG World Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks and started a feud with El Generico, Colt Cabana and the PWG World Champion Kenny Omega. On December 19 Ring of Honor announced that Kendrick would be making his return to the company on February 13, 2010, at the &quot;8th Anniversary Show&quot;. At the event Kendrick was defeated by Roderick Strong.

On January 30, 2010, at PWG&#x27;s WrestleReunion 4 the Young Bucks decided that Kendrick did not fit in with them and turned on him, only for him to be saved by his old tag team partner Paul London. Later in the night, Kendrick and London defeated the Young Bucks, now renamed Generation Me, in a non-title match. On March 27, 2010, at the tapings of Dragon Gate USA&#x27;s &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; pay-per-view, Kendrick was defeated by Jimmy Jacobs in a Loser Leaves Company tag team match, where he teamed with Paul London against Jacobs and Jack Evans and as a result was forced to leave the company for good.

On March 30, 2014, Kendrick made his ICW debut in a match against Joe Coffey at ICW - Still Smokin&#x27; in the O2 ABC in Glasgow, Scotland, where he was narrowly defeated. On September 8, 2014, it was announced that Kendrick would once again team up with Paul London to take on The New Age Kliq in Newcastle, England, on October 5 for the Insane Championship Wrestling Tag-Team Championship. Both men won the titles and lost them on November 2, 2014.

===Return to TNA (2010–2012)===

On January 17, 2010, at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)&#x27;s pay-per-view Genesis, Kendrick made his return to the promotion using his real name and losing to Amazing Red in a match for the TNA X Division Championship, under a similar heel gimmick to his The Brian Kendrick gimmick used in WWE. On April 7, 2010, Dixie Carter announced on her Twitter account that Kendrick had signed a new multi-year deal with the company. On the May 3, 2010, edition of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Kendrick turned face by having a confrontation with his partner Douglas Williams after their match against Ink Inc. (Shannon Moore and Jesse Neal), but then Samoa Joe came out and attacked both of them. The following week, Kendrick picked up his first singles victory since returning to TNA by defeating Williams after a distraction from Kazarian. As a result of his victory, Kendrick was given a shot at Williams&#x27; X Division Championship at Slammiversary VIII, but was unable to win the title.

Kendrick received a rematch the following month at Victory Road, but was defeated again by Williams, this time in an Ultimate X submission match. On the September 2 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kendrick joined EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. At Bound for Glory Kendrick interfered in a Lethal Lockdown match between EV 2.0 and Fortune and helped his team win the match between the two factions. At Turning Point EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. Kendrick was taken out of the match immediately, after being attacked by Douglas Williams. In the end, EV 2.0 lost the match and Sabu was released from TNA.

After the dissolution of EV 2.0, Kendrick spent months wrestling mainly house show matches, before returning to PPV on April 17, 2011, at Lockdown, where he wrestled in an eight-man X Division number one contender&#x27;s Xscape match, where he outlasted six other men, before losing to Max Buck. On the edition of May 5 of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kendrick came together with Amazing Red and Generation Me to battle for X Division&#x27;s future, after the legitimate firing of Jay Lethal. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Kendrick failed in his attempt to win the X Division Championship from Abyss in a three-way match with Kazarian.

The following week Kendrick successfully defended the title against Abyss in an Ultimate X match to end the feud.

On August 7, 2011, at Hardcore Justice, Kendrick successfully defended the title against Alex Shelley and Austin Aries in a three-way match. On September 11 at No Surrender, Kendrick lost the X Division Championship. On the September 29 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kendrick won a five-man ladder match to earn a rematch with Aries. On the October 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kendrick was attacked by Kid Kash for disrespect on Kash. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Kendrick failed in his attempt to regain the X Division Championship from Austin Aries, this was Kendrick&#x27;s last TNA pay-per-view appearance. On the November 17 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kendrick teamed up with Jesse Sorensen to help defeat Austin Aries and Kid Kash in a tag team match, this was Kendrick&#x27;s last appearance in TNA. After three months of inactivity, TNA announced that Kendrick was released from his TNA contract on February 27, 2012.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2011–2013)===
On June 18, 2011, at Dominion 6.18, Kendrick made a surprise debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling in Osaka, teaming with Gedo and Jado in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Jushin Thunder Liger, Kushida and Tiger Mask, when Kendrick pinned Kushida with the &quot;Sliced Bread #2&quot;. Three days later Kendrick, Gedo and Jado were eliminated from the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament in the first round by the team of IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kushida and Máscara Dorada. The two matches built to a singles match between Kendrick and Kushida on June 23, where Kushida managed to pick up the win. During his time in New Japan, Kendrick became an associate member of Chaos and competes for Chaos whenever he has toured New Japan.

On May 11, 2012, New Japan announced that Kendrick would return to the promotion to take part in the 2012 Best of the Super Juniors tournament as Davey Richards&#x27; replacement. In the round-robin stage of the tournament, which ran from May 27 to June 9, Kendrick won five out of his eight matches, but a loss to Ryusuke Taguchi in his final round-robin match caused him to narrowly miss advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. Kendrick returned to New Japan on October 21, when he and Low Ki entered the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament as &quot;Chaos World Wrestling Warriors&quot;. However, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi).

====205 Live (2017–2020)====
In 2017, he developed a gimmick by offering to teaching lessons to the new Akira Tozawa, who declined. This eventually led to a street fight on the May 23, 2017, episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, in which Tozawa defeated Kendrick. Kendrick then began a feud with Jack Gallagher, with Kendrick impersonating and mocking Gallagher after the latter&#x27;s matches. The feud ended on the edition August 29 edition of &quot;205 Live&quot;, when Kendrick defeated Gallagher by referee stoppage in a no disqualification match, which led to Gallagher turning heel and the two regularly competing as a tag team on &quot;205 Live&quot;, having notable matches against Kalisto and Gran Metalik.

On the December 25, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kendrick suffered an injury during a match against Hideo Itami, after Itami performed a &quot;GTS&quot; on Kendrick. After going to a local medical facility, it was revealed that Kendrick suffered a fracture to his orbital bone and nasal bridge and would be out of action for two months. Kendrick returned on the April 17, 2018, edition of &quot;205 Live&quot;, teaming with Gallagher to defeat two local competitors. On the October 3 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick was attacked by his allies Gallagher and Gulak during one of Gulak&#x27;s PowerPoint presentations, with Gulak calling Kendrick the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the group, turning Kendrick face again. On October 17 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick saved his former rival Akira Tozawa from a post-match attack by Gulak and Gallagher. On the October 30 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick defeated Gallagher after Tozawa prevented the interference of Gulak. They two sides went on to trade victories over the next few weeks. On the December 19, 2018, episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick returned to his old clean shaven look and blonde hair as he and Tozawa defeated Gulak and Gallagher in a Street Fight match to end the feud. On the February 26 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick was defeated by Drew Gulak in the first round of the tournament to decide the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship at WrestleMania 35.

Following this, Kendrick would team with Akira Tozawa regularly while also managing him during his chase for the Cruiserweight Championship. In August, Kendrick and Tozawa began a feud with Jack Gallagher after Kendrick accidentally knocked Gallagher&#x27;s foot off the rope during a match with Tozawa, costing him the match. On the September 10 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick and Tozawa faced Gallagher and his mystery partner Kushida in a losing effort. The following week, Kendrick would face Gallagher, where he lost by disqualification after assaulting Gallagher with a kendo stick. After Tozawa confronted him, Kendrick would proceed to assault him with the kendo stick, thus turning heel again. On November 15, Kendrick announced on Twitter that he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from &quot;205 Live&quot;. He returned on the January 3 episode of 205 Live where he cost Danny Burch his match against Ariya Daivari and proceeded to attack him afterwards. On the January 21 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, Kendrick defeated Danny Burch with the help of Daivari.

During January and February 2020, Kendrick wrestled two televised matches for NXT UK, losing to Travis Banks in his first and then losing to A-Kid in his second. After a brief hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kendrick made his return on the August 28 episode of 205 Live where he defeated Tehuti Miles. After the match, he shook hands with Miles thus turning face in the process. Kendrick would continue wrestling on 205 Live in the coming months losing to the likes of Ashante &quot;Thee&quot; Adonis (Tahuti Miles), Isaiah &quot;Swerve&quot; Scott and Mansoor. On the October 30 episode of 205 Live, Kendrick would team with Mansoor to defeat Ever-Rise.

==== Backstage producer (2020–2022, 2022–2023) ====
On March 31, 2021, in a video released on the WWE Performance Center&#x27;s YouTube channel entitled &quot;Brian Kendrick: Life After Wrestling&quot;, Kendrick announced that his match on October 30, 2020, would be his semi-retirement match as he would be transitioning to a backstage producer role and that he would only wrestle part-time. On the December 14 episode of NXT 2.0, Kendrick was involved in an angle where he was thrown down a flight of stairs by Harland after trying to escort him out of the arena. On the December 21 episode of NXT 2.0, Kendrick announced that he had resigned as a coach and would make his in-ring return against Harland. However, the match never took place as scheduled and on January 25, 2022, it was reported that Kendrick had asked for his release from the company, which was granted six days later on February 1. 

In November 2022, he briefly returned to produce Ronda Rousey&#x27;s match at Survivor Series WarGames with Ronda having specifically requested he produce her match. He made another brief return on May 6, 2023, in which he co-produced Bad Bunny&#x27;s match at Backlash. He was requested to do so as he was the one who had produced Bunny&#x27;s match at Wrestlemania 37 and as such Bunny was used to working with him.

===Cancelled All Elite Wrestling appearance (2022)===
On the same day he was granted his WWE release on February 1, 2022, it was announced that Kendrick would make his All Elite Wrestling debut on the February 2 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, where he would face Jon Moxley. The match was pulled from the card, however, when Tony Khan was made aware of controversial comments made by Kendrick in the past. Kendrick would be released from AEW in May 2022, never having made his debut.

==Conspiracy theory controversy==
In 2011, Kendrick told the conspiracy theory website Truth is Scary that he believed the September 11 attacks were faked with holograms and that the killing of Osama bin Laden never happened. In 2013, a Highspots Wrestling Network video interview titled &quot;Brian Kendrick Presents: The Kendrick Theory&quot; featured him discussing his belief that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was faked and that Holocaust gas chambers were used for delousing rather than murder, as well as repeating a false claim that the Red Cross had once admitted that &quot;only 250,000 Jews were killed&quot; during the Holocaust and that the number was exaggerated in order to justify the creation of Israel.

Kendrick&#x27;s comments, along with additional statements regarding his belief in other conspiracy theories, went largely unnoticed until they resurfaced in February 2022 and resulted in mass outrage on social media; his scheduled &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; debut, which had been announced the previous day, was cancelled. He tweeted in response, &quot;I apologize for all the hurt and embarassment I have caused with my words. These are not my beliefs and never were beliefs of mine, and I crossed the line. I spread the most vile comments without thinking of the damage it would cause. I will live with this regret for the rest of my life. I am truly sorry for the pain I have caused.&quot; He was released from AEW in May 2022 without ever appearing for the company. That same month, he claimed that his statements were part of an attempt to establish himself as a &quot;villain&quot; in order to generate bookings as a professional wrestler; he also revealed that he had begun working with The Survivor Mitzvah Project, a charity that supports elderly Holocaust survivors.

==Personal life==
Kendrick married fellow professional wrestler Taylor Matheny in August 2008.

<text>Much Wenlock is a market town and parish in Shropshire, England; it is situated on the A458 road between Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. Nearby, to the north-east, is the Ironbridge Gorge and Telford. The civil parish includes the villages of Homer ( north of the town), Wyke ( north-east), Atterley ( south-east), Stretton Westwood ( south-west) and Bourton ( south-west). The population of the civil parish, according to the 2001 Census, was 2,605, increasing to 2,877 by 2011.

Notable historic attractions in the town are Wenlock Priory, Wenlock Edge, Holy Trinity Church and the Guildhall. The Wenlock Olympian Games, established by William Penny Brookes in 1850, are centred in the town. Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games and one of the London 2012 Summer Olympics mascots was named &quot;Wenlock&quot;, after the town.

==Toponym==
Much Wenlock is historically the chief town of the ancient borough of Wenlock. &quot;Much&quot; was added to distinguish it from the nearby Little Wenlock and to show it is the larger of the two settlements. The name Wenlock probably comes from the Celtic name &quot;Wininicas&quot;, meaning &quot;white area&quot; (in reference to the limestone of Wenlock Edge), plus the Old English &quot;loca&quot;, meaning &quot;enclosed place&quot;. The town was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wenloch&quot;.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Richard Fletcher mentions Much Wenlock as one of the possible locations where a Sub-Roman British Christian community may have survived the Anglo-Saxon occupation and eventually integrated with the conquerors and influenced their culture.

The town of Wenlock is known to have grown up around an abbey or monastery founded around 680 by Merewalh, a son of King Penda of Mercia, with the small town within its parish boundaries. King Penda installed his daughter Milburga as abbess in 687. Milburga of Wenlock was credited with many miraculous works. The abbey flourished until around 874 when it is thought that a Danish Viking attack occurred.

The Domesday Book records the manor as &#x27;Wenloch&#x27; and forming part of the hundred of Patton. It was already at this time a fairly large settlement, with 73 households. The abbey is also recorded in the book, separately. In the 11th century another religious house was built on the same site by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Countess Godiva his wife. In the 12th century this was replaced by a Cluniac priory, established by Roger de Montgomery after the Norman Conquest, the ruins of which can still be seen and which is now in the care of English Heritage.

Early in the 12th century the hundred of Patton was merged with Culvestan to form the hundred of Munslow, but in 1198 Much Wenlock, together with the other manors held by Wenlock Priory, was transferred to the hundredal jurisdiction of the Liberty of Wenlock (also known as Wenlock Franchise).

The Manor of Much Wenlock belonged to the Cluniac Priory until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 when it passed to the Lawley family, and then by marriage of Ursula Lawley to the Bertie family.

=== Borough of Wenlock ===
In 1468 Edward IV granted the men of Much Wenlock a charter forming the Borough of Wenlock, at the request of Sir John Wenlock, and &quot;in consideration of the laudable services which the men of the town performed in assisting the king to gain possession of the crown.&quot; The charter was confirmed in 1547 by Henry VIII after Wenlock Priory was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. The charter was again confirmed in 1631 by Charles I.

Over the years the borough asserted jurisdiction over the liberty of Wenlock. The lands of the liberty included rural areas and a number of detached parts well outside the town, and this resulted in an unusual, geographically dispersed borough. At its height, it was – by area – the largest borough in England outside London and encompassed several of the towns that now constitute Telford. The borough had unusual boundaries, covering Much Wenlock itself, but also Little Wenlock, Broseley and Ironbridge, a total area of . In 1836 the borough was reformed as a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and lost some of its rural areas and detached parts. The borough was further reduced in size in 1889, and was finally abolished in 1966.

=== Later history ===
11-year-old Alice Glaston from Little Wenlock was hanged together with two men in Much Wenlock on 13 April 1546, for an unknown crime. She is the youngest known girl legally executed in Great Britain, though 8- or 9-year-old John Dean was hanged for arson in 1629.

Sir Thomas Wolryche, 1st Baronet (1598–1668) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons for Wenlock between 1621 and 1625. He fought in the Royalist army in the English Civil War, serving as military governor of Bridgnorth.

In 1714, the Manor of Much Wenlock was held by Viscount Gage, who sold it to the Williams-Wynn family.

In the 19th century the town and much of the surrounding land came into the possession of James Milnes Gaskell, from his wife&#x27;s family the Williams-Wynns. James was MP for Wenlock for many years. His son Charles Milnes Gaskell restored the Priory lodging as a home with his wife Lady Catherine, daughter of the Earl of Portsmouth. There they entertained many famous people of the day, writers, politicians, artists and explorers, among them Thomas Hardy, Henry Adams, Henry James, Thomas Woolner, Henry Morton Stanley, Isabella Bird and Philip Webb.

Much Wenlock has become known as the birthplace of Wenlock Olympian Games set up by William Penny Brookes and his Wenlock Olympian Society (WOS) in 1850. In 1861 he was also instrumental in setting up the Shropshire Olympian Games and later in 1866, the National Olympian Games. Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the Modern Olympic Games. In 1890 it was the turn of the Raven Hotel to be the venue for the annual post Wenlock Olympian Games&#x27; dinner, and Baron Pierre de Coubertin was the guest of honour. Copies of some of the WOS&#x27;s archive images are on display in the hotel, including letters from Coubertin to Brookes. The Wenlock Olympian Games, a nine-day event staged on eight sites across Shropshire, are still held annually during July, and are still organised by WOS. Much Wenlock&#x27;s secondary school is named William Brookes School after Dr Brookes.

The London 2012 Summer Olympics mascot was named Wenlock to honour Brookes, WOS and Much Wenlock. On 30 May 2012, the Olympic flame of the 2012 Summer Olympics, was carried through Much Wenlock to acknowledge the founding footsteps of Brookes.

=== Recent times ===
When the Borough was abolished in 1966 the core Wenlock parts became part of the Bridgnorth Rural District, with other parts also going to Dawley Urban District and to Wellington Rural District. In 1974 Much Wenlock joined Bridgnorth District until it was abolished in 2009. It is now represented in the unitary Shropshire Council.

In 1983, actress Gabrielle Drake and her husband purchased Much Wenlock Manor and restored the Priory lodging.

Much Wenlock was the location for the third broadcast episode (the first filmed) of the first series of the archaeology television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; in 1994.

In 2019, Much Wenlock was featured by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as one of the best places to live in the UK.

In May 2023 a site near the town was the location for the discovery, by metal detectorist Richard Brock from Somerset, of &quot;Hiro&#x27;s Nugget&quot;, the largest gold nugget ever found in England. It is estimated to be worth over £30,000.

==Churches==

Holy Trinity Church, in Wilmore Street, is the Anglican parish church. The first church on this site was built in Anglo-Saxon times. The present church dates from 1150 and was built by the Cluniac monks from Wenlock Priory. Features of interest include the plain Norman tower which had a spire until early in the 20th century, and a memorial inside the church to W. P. Brookes as well as the refurbished family gravestones in the churchyard. The churchyard is a large, open, green space with some tall trees. The Shit Brook ran along the road towards the church before it was culverted. There is also a Methodist church in King Street.

== Other buildings ==

Other architectural attractions include the 16th-century Much Wenlock Guildhall, and the mid-19th century Much Wenlock Corn Exchange.

<text>Golem is an inductive logic programming algorithm developed by Stephen Muggleton and Cao Feng in 1990. It uses the technique of relative least general generalisation proposed by Gordon Plotkin, leading to a bottom-up search through the subsumption lattice. In 1992, shortly after its introduction, Golem was considered the only inductive logic programming system capable of scaling to tens of thousands of examples. 

== Description ==
Golem takes as input a definite program as background knowledge together with sets of positive and negative examples, denoted formula_1 and formula_2 respectively. The overall idea is to construct the least general generalisation of formula_1 with respect to the background knowledge. However, if is not merely a finite set of ground atoms, then this relative least general generalisation may not exist.
Therefore, rather than using directly, Golem uses the set formula_4 of all ground atoms that can be resolved from in at most resolution steps. An additional difficulty is that if formula_2 is non-empty, the least general generalisation of formula_1 may entail a negative example. In this case, Golem generalises different subsets of formula_1 separately to obtain a program of several clauses. 
Golem also employs some restrictions on the hypothesis space, ensuring that relative least general generalisations are polynomial in the number of training examples. Golem demands that all variables in the head of a clause also appears in a literal of the clause body; that the number of substitutions needed to instantiate existentially quantified variables introduced in a literal is bounded; and that the depth of the chain of substitutions needed to instantiate such a variable is also bounded. 

==Example==

The following example about learning definitions of family relations uses the abbreviations 
:, , , , , , , , and . 
It starts from the background knowledge (cf. picture)
:formula_8,
the positive examples
:formula_9,
and the trivial proposition

to denote the absence of negative examples.

The relative least general generalisation is now computed as follows to obtain a definition of the &quot;daughter&quot; relation.

* Relativise each positive example literal with the complete background knowledge:
*:formula_10,
* Convert into clause normal form:
*:formula_11,
* Anti-unify each compatible pair of literals:
**formula_12 from formula_13 and formula_14,
**formula_15 from formula_16 and formula_17,
**formula_18 from formula_19 and formula_20,
**formula_21 from formula_21 and formula_21, similar for all other background-knowledge literals 
**formula_24 from formula_21 and formula_17, and many more negated literals 
* Delete all negated literals containing variables that don&#x27;t occur in a positive literal:
**after deleting all negated literals containing other variables than formula_27, only formula_28 remains, together with all ground literals from the background knowledge
* Convert clauses back to Horn form:
** formula_29
The resulting Horn clause is the hypothesis obtained by Golem. Informally, the clause reads &quot;formula_30 is called a daughter of formula_31 if formula_31 is the parent of formula_30 and formula_30 is female&quot;, which is a commonly accepted definition.

<doc id="993985" wikidata="Q445046" url="?curid=993985" title="Melissa Bean">
<text>Melissa Bean (née Luburich; born January 22, 1962) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2011. Bean is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Bean attended Maine East High School before graduating from Oakton Community College with an associate degree in 1982 and from Roosevelt University in 2002 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Prior to her election to Congress, she was president of a home-based business, Sales Resources Inc.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2002
In 2002, Bean ran against 73-year-old 8th District Republican incumbent Phil Crane, a 33-year incumbent. Bean attacked Crane for taking numerous lobbyist-funded trips. She lost, but gained 43% of the vote. This was unexpected since she had received very little funding from the national party. The 8th had historically been the most Republican district in the Chicago area, and by some accounts was the most Republican district in all of Illinois. Bean&#x27;s performance was even more notable since the 8th had reportedly been redrawn to protect Crane.

;2004
Bean sought a rematch against Crane in 2004. During the campaign, Bean raised almost as much money as Crane, mostly from individual donors, whereas Crane&#x27;s money came mostly from political action committees. Her strong showing in 2002 led the national party to pump a large amount of money into her campaign. Bean was endorsed by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;—the three major newspapers in her district.

Faced with having to campaign for what was previously thought to be a safe seat, the Republicans tried their best to keep Crane in office. However, on November 2, 2004, Bean defeated Crane with 52% of the vote. Although George W. Bush during the 2004 presidential election won the district with 56% of the vote, Bean was helped by US Senate candidate Barack Obama, who carried the district. She is the first Democrat to represent the district since its formation in 1935. (The district was numbered the 10th District from 1935 to 1949, the 13th from 1949 to 1973, the 12th from 1973 to 1993 and has been the 8th since 1993.)

;2006

In 2006, Bean&#x27;s seat was seen by Republicans as winnable due to her freshman status, the 8th district&#x27;s historical Republican tilt, and George W. Bush&#x27; 2004 presidential vote margin. Most of the district&#x27;s state representatives and state senators were Republicans. In much of the district, Bean was the only elected Democrat above the county level. Bean&#x27;s reelection became a top priority of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).

Bean faced the winner of a competitive six-candidate Republican primary, David McSweeney, in the general election. As in 2004, Bean was endorsed by all three of the major newspapers in her district. She defeated McSweeney, 51% to 44%.

;2008

Bean decisively defeated her 2008 opponent, businessman Steve Greenberg. Although she was one of forty-four Democrats in the House who voted to condemn the MoveOn.org group for their controversial &quot;General Betray-us&quot; ad in 2007, he criticized her for accepting over $80,000 in campaign donations from them three years earlier. Bean defeated Greenberg, 60% to 40%.

;2010

Bean was challenged by Republican nominee Joe Walsh and Green Party nominee Bill Scheurer. Although Bean was heavily favored, she lost to Walsh by only 291 votes. Bill Scheurer received 6,400 votes, which far exceeded Walsh&#x27;s margin of victory.

Bean was endorsed by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Herald&quot;, and the &quot;Lake County News-Sun&quot;.

===Tenure===
Bean was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition.

Bean was a member of the Small Business and Financial Services committees for her entire House tenure. Normally, House Democrats who serve on the Financial Services Committee cannot serve on any other committee. However, Bean was granted a waiver by the Democratic leadership.

Bean&#x27;s business and financial record includes opposing a bill that would have allowed for drilling for oil in Lake Michigan which is a large source of drinking water for her district. She has departed from the Democrats in voting in May 2006 to extend about $70 billion in tax cuts (she was one of just 15 Democrats to back the legislation), voting to permanently reduce the estate tax, and voting in favor of a presidential line-item veto. Similarly, she is one of only 15 Democrats to vote in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). In 2009, she voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the American Clean Energy and Security Act. She was a co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act.

On other issues, Bean opposed President Bush&#x27;s troop &quot;surge&quot; in Iraq. In a February 2006 speech given before the surge had been fully implemented, Bean said, &quot;regrettably, this surge does not constitute a new course.&quot; On social issues, Bean is pro-choice and voted in support of Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, health care reform. Bean was one of four Democrats to vote against the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, joining 155 of 159 Republicans, blocking the vote (which needed a 2/3 majority to pass, as it was brought to vote under a motion to suspend rules).

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
*Committee on Small Business
**Subcommittee on Finance and Tax
**Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology
**Subcommittee on Regulations, Healthcare and Trade

==Electoral history==
==After Congress==
In 2011, Bean became President and CEO of the Executives Club of Chicago. After serving as chair of Midwest operations for JPMorgan Chase, she became CEO of Mesirow Wealth Advisors, part of Mesirow Financial, in 2019.

==Personal life==
Bean lives in unincorporated Palatine Township with her husband and two children. Their residence was in the 8th District when they moved there, but became part of the 10th District because of redistricting. They lived in an adjoining district for her entire time in Congress. Bean is Serbian Orthodox.

<doc id="993986" wikidata="Q6137605" url="?curid=993986" title="List of Nissan engines">
<text>This is a list of piston engines developed by Nissan Motors.

==Engine naming convention==
Nissan uses a straightforward method of naming their automobile engines. 

The first few letters identify the engine family. The following digits are the displacement in deciliters. Finally, the trailing letters encode the main engine features, and are ordered based on the type of feature. Below is a list of encoded letters, and the engine features they represent. Make note, the first few letters in the engine name that identify the engine family have nothing to do with these encoded letters for the engine features, and should not be confused as such.

The encoded letters that represent engine features follow a specific order and not all features are necessarily listed all of the time. The basic, common features follow this general order:

[Engine family] [two-digit engine displacement in deciliters] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]

:1 = Camshaft
:2 = Fuel delivery
:3 = Power delivery
:4 = Power adder
:5 = 2nd power adder
:6 = Special

A good example to start with is the Nissan VG30DETT engine. It belongs to the VG engine family, displaces 30 deciliters (3.0 liters), and the feature letters describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts, electronic port fuel injection and two turbochargers.

The next example is the Nissan VQ35DE engine. It belongs to the VQ engine family and displaces 35 deciliters (3.5 liters). The feature letters describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts and electronic port fuel injection, but leaves off any power adder descriptors because it is a naturally aspirated engine. The (single) turbocharged version of the VQ displaces 30 deciliters (3.0 liters) and is logically called the VQ30DET.

Not all features are necessarily described in the name. For example, the SR20VE engine has dual overhead camshafts, but the variable valve lift design of the camshafts takes precedence in the naming scheme even though the &quot;V&quot; feature designation doesn&#x27;t necessarily describe a DOHC arrangement. Many standard DOHC Nissan engines featured Variable Valve Timing, such as the VG30DETT, and as such do not use the &quot;V&quot; designation. The &quot;V&quot; designation is applied only if the engine has variable valve lift.

A good example of an engine where not all of the feature designation spots are used is the L28ET engine. The two features listed are electronic port fuel injection designated with the &quot;E&quot; and the presence of a turbocharger designed with the letter &quot;T&quot;. The engine has a single overhead camshaft so there is no &quot;D&quot; listed in the name; the camshaft type designation place being left out completely. Nissan does not have a letter designation for the SOHC configuration so the camshaft configuration type is assumed as SOHC if no letter is present.

Another example is the MR16DDT engine, which has feature designations that describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts, direct cylinder fuel injection and a single turbocharger.

Lastly, there are engines built specifically as power generators for electric motors, designated with the lowercase &quot;e&quot;. The HR14DDe engine is a good example of this, as this engine was purposely built for use with the EM57 electric motor as a power generator. The feature letters describe it as an engine with dual overhead camshafts, direct cylinder fuel injection with variable valve timing (bear in mind that the &quot;V&quot; designation is not used here, as that is used for variable valve lift) and is used as a power generator for electric motors.

<doc id="993987" wikidata="Q897028" url="?curid=993987" title="Absent-minded professor">
<text>The absent-minded professor is a stock character of popular fiction, usually portrayed as a talented academic whose academic brilliance is accompanied by below-par functioning in other areas, leading to forgetfulness and mistakes. One explanation of this is that highly talented individuals often have unevenly distributed capabilities, being brilliant in their field of choice but below average on other measures of ability. Alternatively, they are considered to be so engrossed in their field of study that they forget their surroundings. The phrase is also commonly used in English to describe people who are so engrossed in their own world that they fail to keep track of their surroundings. It is a common stereotype that professors get so obsessed with their research that they pay little attention to anything else.

The archetype is sometimes mixed with that of the mad scientist, often for comic effect, as in the Jerry Lewis film &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; or the Profesor Bacterio in the &quot;Mortadelo y Filemón&quot; comics and movies. However, a distinction is usually made that absent-minded professors are forgetful and careless rather than maliciously causing harm.

==Examples of real scholars==
The archetype is very old: the ancient Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtius wrote that the philosopher Thales walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a well. Thomas Aquinas, Isaac Newton, Adam Smith, André-Marie Ampère, Jacques Hadamard, Sewall Wright, Nikola Tesla, Norbert Wiener, Archimedes, Pierre Curie and Albert Einstein were all scholars considered to be absent-minded – their attention absorbed by their academic studies. William Archibald Spooner, who gave his name to the spoonerism, was known for his absent-mindedness and eccentricity.

==Fictitious examples==

The fictional absent-minded professor is often a college professor of science or engineering; in the fantasy genre, a similar character may appear as a wizard. Examples of this include the characterisation of Merlin in &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (particularly in the Disney adaptation) and Albus Dumbledore in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. &quot;Doc&quot; Emmett Brown from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is an example of an absent-minded scientist-inventor character. He is depicted as strange, eccentric, or insane. Another example is the title character in the film &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; and its less successful film remakes, all based on the short story &quot;A Situation of Gravity&quot; by Samuel W. Taylor. Examples in television include Professor Farnsworth in &quot;Futurama&quot;, Professor Frink in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Walter Bishop in the Fox television series &quot;Fringe&quot;, and Professor Von Schlemmer in &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Multo, one of the characters in the children&#x27;s series &quot;The Zula Patrol&quot;, is another example of an absent-minded professor.

Professor Kokintz in &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; by Leonard Wibberley is an example from literature. Professor Branestawm, created in the 1930s by Norman Hunter, is an earlier example of the archetype, and Jacques Paganel from the Jules Verne&#x27;s 1867 novel &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; is probably the codifier of the archetype in the modern literature. Professor Caractacus Potts in the story of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; qualifies as an absent-minded inventor. Comic strip examples include Professor Calculus in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;; Eli Eon in &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;; the Professor in British comic &quot;Rupert Bear&quot;; and Professor Edgewise, a minor recurring character in Marvel Family stories. Isaac Kleiner from the &quot;Half-Life&quot; saga, Professor E. Gadd from the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series and Professor Harold MacDougal from &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; are examples in video games.

<text>Ryan Keiji Sakoda (December 31, 1972 – September 2, 2021) was a Japanese American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances in WWE and later Ultimate Pro Wrestling as a part-time trainer for the wrestlers, as well as working in the independents under his real name.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1998–2003)===
Before coming to WWE, Sakoda had a successful stint in the NWA Zero-One promotion in Japan, stemming from his appearances for Ultimate Pro Wrestling. During this time Sakoda often filled in as an instructor at UPW&#x27;s Ultimate University, while wrestling as part of the faction Team Emblem with Japanese superstars Masato Tanaka and Shinjiro Otani.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2004)===
On January 6, 2003, Sakoda made his first onscreen appearance for WWE on Raw as a judge for World Heavyweight Champion Triple H and Scott Steiner&#x27;s pose down under the name Charlie Chan.

In September 2003, Sakoda was signed to a developmental contract, and it wouldn&#x27;t be long before Sakoda was brought up to SmackDown!&#x27;s main roster. He, along with Akio, made their WWE debuts on October 19, 2003, at No Mercy. Sakoda aligned himself with Akio, forming the heel tag team Kyo Dai, the yakuza-style henchmen of Tajiri.

In August 2004, Sakoda was released from his WWE contract.

===Return to independent circuit (2005–2007)===
After WWE, Sakoda returned to UPW in March 2005 as a part-time trainer and part-time auto sales executive at Worthington Ford. He made his return to full-time in-ring competition in 2007 with MTV&#x27;s Wrestling Society X. Wrestling as an independent in the local mall circuit until his death, Sakoda had been working as a server for Disney at one of their Grand California Hotel restaurants.

==Personal life==
Sakoda filed a class action lawsuit against WWE, alleging that wrestlers sustained traumatic brain injuries while wrestling for them and that the company tried to conceal that information. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In March 2016, the suit was dismissed as frivolous by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.

==Death==
Sakoda died on September 2, 2021, at the age of 48. His death was not announced until September 27.

<doc id="993993" wikidata="Q1029503" url="?curid=993993" title="Marine Corps Air Station Miramar">
<text>Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (MCAS Miramar) is a United States Marine Corps installation that is home to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, which is the aviation element of the I Marine Expeditionary Force. It is located in Miramar, a community of San Diego, California, about north of downtown San Diego.

The airfield has been named Mitscher Field since 1955, after Admiral M.A. Mitscher, who was the commander of Task Force 58 during World War II. The air station is the former location of Pacific Fleet fighter and Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft (F-4 Phantom II, F-14 Tomcat, E-2 Hawkeye) and is best known as the former location of the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS), its TOPGUN training program and the movie of the same name. In 1996, NFWS was relocated to Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada, 60 miles east of Reno, and merged into the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC). During the heyday of TOPGUN at NAS Miramar, the station was nicknamed &quot;Fightertown USA&quot;.

==Geography==

The base contains . It is bisected by Kearny Villa Road and Interstate 15. The area east of Kearny Villa Road, called &quot;East Miramar&quot;, is undeveloped and is used for military training. Miramar is recognized as the world&#x27;s largest Master Jet Air Station.

==History==

Kumeyaay Native Americans were the first inhabitants in the vicinity of the base. Spain claimed the San Diego area in 1542 and colonized it beginning in 1769. In 1846, the crown issued a land grant that included the area of the current base to Don Santiago Argüello. After the American Civil War, the land was divided and sold to people such as Edward Scripps, a newspaper publisher from the eastern United States, who developed a ranch on the site. It was Scripps who named the area Miramar, meaning &quot;view of the sea&quot;. The land was predominantly used for grazing and farming into the early 20th century.

===1918–1941===
During World War I, the U.S. Army acquired of land in the Miramar Ranch area, on a mesa north of San Diego. Camp Kearny was opened on 18 January 1917 and was named after Stephen W. Kearny, who was commander of the Army of the West during the Mexican–American War. The base was primarily used to train infantrymen on their way to the battlefields of Europe. During World War I, an airstrip was never built on the property, although Army and U.S. Navy aircraft from Naval Air Station North Island did land on the parade deck. Following the Armistice, the base was used to demobilize servicemen and was closed on 20 October 1920. More than 1,200 buildings were demolished when the camp closed.

Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; airplane was built in nearby San Diego. Lindbergh used the abandoned Camp Kearny parade field to practice landings and take-offs before making his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.

During the 1930s, the Navy briefly used the air base for helium dirigibles. In 1932, a mooring mast and hangar were built at the camp for the dirigibles, but when the program was abandoned, the base was quiet again.

===World War II===
By the time World War II began, Miramar was already undergoing a &quot;precautionary&quot; renovation. Camp Holcomb (later renamed Camp Elliott) was built on part of old Camp Kearny, to be used for U.S Marine Corps artillery and machine gun training. Camp Elliott became home to Fleet Marine Force Training Center, West Coast, and the 2nd Marine Division, charged with defending the California coast. Runways were constructed in 1940, and the 1st Marine Air Wing arrived on 21 December of that year. The Navy commissioned Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Camp Kearny in February 1943, specifically to train crews for the Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, which was built less than away in San Diego. A month later, the Marines established Marine Corps Air Depot Camp Kearny, later renamed Marine Corps Air Depot Miramar, to avoid confusion with the Navy facility.

The big Privateers proved too heavy for the asphalt concrete runway the Army had installed in 1936 and the longer runways built in 1940, so the Navy added two concrete runways in 1943.

During the 1940s, both the Navy and the Marine Corps occupied Miramar. East Miramar (Camp Elliott) was used to train Marine artillery and armored personnel, while Navy and Marine Corps pilots trained on the western side. The bases were combined and designated Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in 1946.

===Naval Air Station===
In 1947, the Marines moved to MCAS El Toro in Orange County, California, and Miramar was redesignated as NAAS Miramar (Naval Auxiliary Air Station Miramar). It became NAS Miramar (Naval Air Station Miramar) on 1 March 1952. In 1954, the Navy offered NAS Miramar to San Diego for $1 and the city considered using the base to relocate its airport. But it was deemed at the time to be too far away from most residents and the offer was declined.

Only the western half of Miramar&#x27;s facilities were put to use; the old east station began to deteriorate, with many buildings sold as scrap. Miramar found new life as a Navy Master Jet Station in the 1950s. The eastern half, former Camp Elliot, was used by the United States Air Force for Project Orion (having been transferred temporarily), and later by NASA; it was the site of several launches. The base really came into its own during the Vietnam War. The Navy needed a school to train pilots in dog-fighting and in fleet air defense. In 1969, the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School was established organizationally as part of VF-121, which was then the F-4 Phantom Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Personnel (FRAMP), which trained the maintainers who joined the fleet as qualified &quot;Phantom Phixeres&quot;.

In October 1972, Miramar welcomed the F-14 Tomcat and fighter squadron VF-124, a former Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) tasked with the mission to train new Tomcat crews. Formerly, VF-124 had been training pilots in the F-8 Crusader. That task was handed over to Light Photographic Squadron 63 (VFP-63) that then became &quot;Crusader College&quot; The first two operational Tomcat squadrons, VF-1 known as the &quot;Wolfpack&quot; and VF-2 known as the &quot;Bounty Hunters,&quot; trained here before deploying aboard in 1974.

NAS Miramar was also the west coast E-2 squadrons home. VAW-110 the west coast fleet replacement squadron and fleet squadrons VAW-112, VAW-113, VAW-114 (disestablished 1995), VAW-116 and VAW-117. With the change to MCAS Miramar, the training squadron was disestablished and moved to NAS Norfolk, Virginia. The fleet squadrons were moved to NAS Point Mugu, California.

===1990s–Present: Marine Corps Air Station===

In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission recommended that MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin be closed down and that NAS Miramar be transferred to the Marine Corps. BRAC also recommended that all Navy Pacific Fleet F-14 aircraft and squadrons (with the exception of those assigned to Carrier Air Wing 5 in Japan) and Pacific Fleet F-14 training be consolidated with the Atlantic Fleet and be relocated to NAS Oceana, Virginia. BRAC recommended that Pacific Fleet E-2C training be consolidated with Atlantic Fleet E-2C training at NAS Norfolk, that all Pacific Fleet E-2C aircraft and squadrons (with the exception of those assigned to Carrier Air Wing 5 in Japan) be relocated to NAS Point Mugu, and that the Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) and Navy Reserve adversary squadron VFC-13 be relocated to NAS Fallon, Nevada.

In 1999, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin were closed and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing returned to Miramar when it officially became Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. On 1 October 1997, Colonel Thomas A. Caughlan became the first Marine commanding officer of MCAS Miramar since World War II. Caughlan was also the last commanding officer of MCAS Tustin.

In 2005, the BRAC Commission directed instructor pilots and support personnel from Miramar to Eglin AFB in Florida, sufficient to stand up the Marine Corps&#x27; portion of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program (JSF) Training Site. This will lead to an eventual phasing out of fighter pilot training at Miramar by 2015 as the F/A-18 Hornets are retired.

In 2006, the San Diego County Proposition A proposed obtaining 3000 acres (12 km2) at MCAS Miramar to develop a commercial airport. The proposition was defeated 62 percent opposed to 38 percent in favor.

===Noise===
Numerous noise complaints have been lodged against MCAS Miramar (and its predecessor, NAS Miramar) going back for decades funded partly by real estate developers (Pardee Construction Co). MCAS Miramar is located near the center of the City of San Diego. It is surrounded on three sides by residential areas including Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, University City, Clairemont, and Tierrasanta. MCAS Miramar has a web site and phone number that people can call to register complaints about noise. To lessen the noise impact to the community, MCAS Miramar has made adjustments to their operations over the years, including the use of hush-houses, limitations on engine run-ups, and modification to flight plans. In spite of efforts, noise complaints remain an issue in 2019.

==Crashes==
There have been a number of aviation accidents:
* On 4 December 1959, an F3H Demon with Navy pilot ENS Albert Joe Hickman crashed into the adjoining community of Clairemont Mesa. The pilot stayed with the aircraft to avoid hitting a school. The city named an elementary school in Mira Mesa after him.
* On 12 August 1968, a U.S. Navy Vought F-8 Crusader (F-8C) fighter jet of VF-124 crashed while returning to (then) NAS Miramar, from nighttime Sidewinder missile training with three other F-8 Crusader fighters. The pilot, LT (JG) Roman S. Ohnemus, 25, did not eject, and died in the crash. The incident occurred in the dark, early morning hours in remote, brush-covered terrain off what is now Canyon Hills Park and Spitfire Way in Mira Mesa(somewhat level except for narrow valleys), north of (then) NAS Miramar, and Miramar Road, west of U.S. Highway 395 (now Interstate 15), and south of Black Mountain. A small brush fire was started by the crash. Live missiles presented a dangerous crash site to the first-arriving state forestry firefighters, who were woken by the crash. They were from the nearby fire station located at Carroll Canyon and then Highway 395 (between 1 and 2 miles) Miramar California Division of Forestry (now CalFire) fire station.
* On 22 December 1969, an F-8J Crusader of VF-194 crashed into a hangar at NAS Miramar, after the pilot ejected. 14 died and 30 were injured. Pilot Lt. C. M. Riddell ejected safely. Five other fighters, including two F-4 Phantoms, were damaged in the repair facility fire that ensued. Helicopters and military and civilian ambulances were used to transport the injured to Balboa Naval Hospital, San Diego.
* On 27 March 1978, an F-14 Tomcat from VF-1 crashed into I-15 just short of the runway and was stopped on the northbound lanes by a concrete divider. One aviator in the Tomcat was killed.
* On 7 November 1978, an A-4 Skyhawk used by the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, crashed and the pilot was killed.
* On 11 March 1985, an F-8 Crusader crashed into a parking lot of a nearby industrial park. The pilot ejected safely.
*On 3 December 1985, U.S. Navy Capt Henry M. Kleeman was killed when his F/A-18 Hornet skidded 5000 feet and flipped on a wet runway.
*On 21 March 1987 an F-14 Tomcat crashed just south of Poway Road, into the canyons of what is now the Mercy Road area, approximately 4 miles from the base. Both crewmembers ejected safely.
* On 26 June 1987, an A-3 Skywarrior from VQ-1 was practicing night Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) - The aircraft impacted the ground after turning downwind subsequent to take off. Three crewmembers were killed.
* On 11 March 2004, a UC-35 crashed on east Miramar at the approach end of the runway. Four Marines were killed.
* In November 2006, an F/A-18D Hornet from VMFAT-101 crashed on the eastern perimeter of the base, with the pilot ejecting safely.
* On 8 December 2008, four people were killed, two homes were destroyed and three homes were damaged when an F/A-18D Hornet crashed about from the base. The plane was returning from training exercises with the USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, which was off the coast of San Diego. The pilot was attempting to steer the aircraft to an unpopulated area when he lost all engine, electrical and hydraulic power. He ejected safely.
* On 24 August 2023, an F/A-18 Hornet crashed east of the base close to the I-15. The sole pilot aboard died after ejecting from the aircraft.

<text>Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA-232) is a United States Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet squadron. Nicknamed the &quot;Red Devils&quot;, the squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The Red Devils are the oldest and most decorated fighter squadron in the Marine Corps.

==History==

===The early years===

VMFA-232 can trace its lineage back to VF-3M, which was commissioned on 1 September 1925, at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. Originally equipped with Vought VE-7s, the squadron received three of the new Boeing FB-1s in the first part of 1926, allowing them to operate one division of modern aircraft while retaining the older VE-7s for training purposes. With the civil war in China threatening American interests, it was decided to deploy U.S. forces and in November and December 1926, seven additional FB-1s were transferred to VF-3M from VF-1M and VF-2M on the east coast, bringing the squadron&#x27;s complement to 10 FB-1s. As diplomacy and planning was taking place on the international level, the squadron concentrated on familiarizing itself with their new aircraft and training the influx of new pilots.

On 7 April 1927, VF-3M departed San Diego bound for China on the transport , but upon arrival, no airfield was available for operations. After waiting in the Philippines for almost two months, the squadron returned to China and eventually operated from airfields at Tientsin and Hsin-Ho, where they supported the 3rd Brigade. Shortly after setting up camp and starting flight operations, the squadron was redesignated VF-10M on 1 July 1927, the first of many changes in designation caused by the reorganization of naval aviation assets. The mission to China demonstrated that Marine Aviation was vital to the expeditionary role Marine forces were called on to perform and the squadron performed photography, mapping and reconnaissance missions while deployed. Another change in designation occurred while the squadron was still in China, when on 1 July 1928, the squadron was redesignated VF-6M. With its mission in China completed, the squadron withdrew on 3 October 1928, arriving back at San Diego on 31 October 1928, after stops at Guam and Hawaii.

With its return to San Diego, most of the squadron&#x27;s personnel were transferred to other units and the next year was spent re-organizing and training new personnel as they arrived. In addition to new pilots, several Boeing FB-5s were assigned to the squadron in 1929, the last of the in-line aircraft to be used by Marine squadrons. On 1 July 1930 the squadron was again re-designated, this time reverting to VF-10M, but the most noticeable change was the replacement of the FB-5s with Curtiss F6C-4s, the first radial engine fighters the squadron would be assigned. The squadron would operate the F6C-4s for over two years and be awarded the Herbert H. Schiff Cup for aviation safety before they were replaced by factory-fresh Boeing F4B-4s in late 1932, the most advanced biplane fighter in service at that time.

In 1932, it was determined that Marine Aviation should be provided with two light bombing squadrons, and on 1 July 1933, VF-10M became VB-4M, and was re-equipped with Boeing F4B-3s, a move considered a step back by members of the squadron. Participation in the Los Angeles National Air Races and annual Fleet Exercises were part of the routine that marked the squadron&#x27;s activity in the early 1930s. In 1935, the squadron received 16 Great Lakes BG-1s, large two-place dive bombers that would equip the squadron for over five years.

On 1 July 1937, Marine aviation was completely reorganized to conform to Navy requirements, and VB-4M became VMB-2. Still flying the BG-1, the squadron continued to take part in the annual Fleet Exercises, and in December 1940, the squadron began receiving the new Douglas SBD-1, the first mono-plane in Marine Corps service. Arrival of the SBD also marked the first time that the Red Devil insignia was not carried on the squadron&#x27;s aircraft, even though it was authorized to do so.

===World War II===
With the tension in the Pacific increasing, VMB-2 was deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Oahu, Hawaii. Early 1941 also saw the transition from the colorful pre-war scheme to the tactical, and less colorful, light gray scheme, but still the Red Devil insignia was absent. On 1 July 1941, in anticipation of the large expansion marine aviation was about to undergo, VMB-2 became VMSB-232, the designation it carried during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during which one member of the squadron was killed and nine of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were destroyed, with ten more requiring major overhaul. On Wake Island, a Red Devil detachment suffered twenty five enlisted Marines killed or captured while assisting in the defense of the doomed island.

On 20 August 1942, the squadron became part of the Cactus Air Force. and flew SBD Dauntlesses from Guadalcanal&#x27;s 3,000-foot dirt runway Henderson Field. The Red Devils became the first Marine dive bomber squadron to fly against the Japanese. On the evening of 11-12 September, cruisers and destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy sailed into Ironbottom Sound and began shelling Henderson Field. Two pilots from VMSB-232 were killed and another two Marines were wounded. The squadron departed Guadalcanal on 12 October 1942, heading for Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, where it was redesignated again, this time as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232 (VMTB-232), flying newly acquired Grumman TBF Avengers. The squadron returned to the Pacific in July 1943 where it was first based in Espiritu Santo. From there it moved to Munda in order to support allied forces during the Bougainville landings in November 1943.

For the next few months, the squadron participated in strikes against the isolated Japanese garrison at Rabaul. On 14 February 1944, Avengers from VMTB-232 and VMTB-233 took part in a mission to sow mines in Simpson Harbour at Rabaul. The Grumman TBM Avengers were to fly up in three groups of eight each at the speed of 160 knots to drop their parachute-mines, weighing 1,600 pounds apiece. The first group lost one plane. The commanding officer tried to radio the other TBFs to warn them to turn back but he couldn&#x27;t make radio contact. The second group lost two planes. The third group was immediately found by searchlight and anti-aircraft guns while flying at 800 feet over the water and had five aircraft shot down. Six planes and eighteen men were lost during the attack.
Four of the eighteen men survived the loss of the six TBFs that evening. Of the four, none survived captivity. One was murdered at Tunnel Hill, two died of starvation, disease or medical neglect, and a fourth was murdered by the Japanese Navy some time in April.

The next few months would see them move continuously, operating from Piva, Green Island, Emirau and Ulithi. VMTB-232 landed at Kadena on 22 April 1945, and began flying close air support missions three days later and for the rest of the Battle of Okinawa. In July 1945 they began to fly strikes against the Japanese mainland until the surrender of Japan. During its participation in operations throughout World War II, VMTB-232 lost forty-nine Marines and seventeen aircraft. On 16 November 1945, the squadron, one of the few to earn two presidential citations during the war, arrived at San Diego, and was temporarily decommissioned.

===1950s===

On 3 June 1948 the Red Devils were reactivated as a reserve fighter squadron at NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field, New York, with the name it currently holds; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232. With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the squadron was placed on alert and ordered to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. Here, the squadron received its first delivery of the F4U Corsair. Although the unit itself did not deploy to Korea, by April 1951 nearly all the original aviators and forty percent of the enlisted Marines in the squadron had been detached and sent overseas for combat duty.

In March 1953, the Red Devils transitioned to the jet age with the receipt of the Grumman F9F Panther. In 1954, homebase for 232 was changed from MCAS El Toro, to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, where they flew the FJ Fury, the &quot;Navalized&quot; version of the F-86 Sabre. In March 1956, the Red Devils, VMF 232 set a &quot;till that time&quot; record of 2558 flight hours and 1571 sorties in one month. The Red Devils moved to the final version of the Fury, the FJ-4 from &#x27;56-&#x27;59. VMF 232 was deployed to Westpac on the USS &quot;Bennington&quot; during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in the fall of 1958 and later was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi. That year the squadron flew over 10,000 hours and was named by the Commandant, the Marine Fighter Squadron of the Year. After arriving back in Japan, the squadron received its complement of new F-8 Crusaders beginning in March 1959.

===Vietnam War===

As a result of intensified operations in Southeast Asia, VMF(AW)-232 departed MCAS Kaneohe Bay, and were flying combat sorties out of Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam by December 1966. Staying online for the next 290 consecutive days, the squadron flew 5,785 sorties encompassing 7,273 flight hours and delivering 6,221 tons of ordnance. The squadron&#x27;s aircraft were equipped with TPQ-10 bombing radar receivers thus making them ideal close air support platforms. They were also the only Marine aircraft capable of carrying 2,000-pound bombs until the arrival of Marine A-6 Intruders.

In September 1967, the squadron returned to MCAS El Toro and painted the Red Devil insignia on their new McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms. Redesignated as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232, the squadron returned to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. In March 1969, the squadron deployed to MAG 13 at Chu Lai Air Base, Vietnam, supporting ground operations in I Corps. They returned to Iwakuni in late 1969.

In April 1972, the entire squadron redeployed from Japan to Vietnam with minimum notice to counter the spring offensive of that year. After a three-month stay at Da Nang Air Base, VMFA-232 moved its operations to Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role on Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. During their time operating out of Thailand, the squadron lost three F-4J Phantoms and two crewman. One of these aircraft was shot down by a MiG-21 over North Vietnam. The only &quot;last&quot; in VMFA-232&#x27;s history occurred in September 1973 as the Red Devils became the last Marine squadron to leave the Vietnam War.

The squadron remained at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan as a force in readiness while participating in numerous training deployments and exercises. In 1974, the Red Devils received the coveted Robert M. Hanson &quot;Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year&quot; award.

In October 1977, the Red Devils of VMFA-232 returned to MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, after an eleven-year absence. This event, in turn, marked the beginning of Red Devils participation in the demanding Westpac Unit Deployment Program. In October 1986, the Red Devils completed their sixth, and last six-month tour of the Western Pacific in the venerable F-4 Phantom. In December 1988, VMFA-232 turned in their last F-4 Phantom II to the National Air and Space Museum.

===1980s and 1990s===
VMFA-232 deployed from MCAS Kaneohe Bay to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in September 1982 as part of the Unit Deployment Program. During this deployment the squadron also conducted operations from Kadena Air Base and Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines while also flying combat air patrols with aircraft from the and . The squadron returned to Hawaii in March 1982.

In early 1989, the Red Devils began their transition to the F/A-18 Hornet. Aircrew trained at VMFAT-101 at MCAS El Toro and the maintenance department at FRAMP at NAS Lemoore, California. In June 1989, with return of aircrew and maintenance personnel to Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and receipt of their twelfth Hornet, the Red Devils had completed the transition.

In December 1990, with intensification of Operation Desert Shield, the squadron deployed to Shaikh Isa, Bahrain. On 17 January 1991, the Red Devils were among the first to cross the Iraqi border during Operation Desert Storm. After 41 days of intense combat operations, Kuwait was liberated as the Red Devils completed 740 combat missions and 1,390 hours. For their outstanding performance in Southwest Asia, VMFA-232 received the Navy Unit Commendation. Returning to Hawaii in April 1991, the squadron spent four short months at home before they were again deployed to Westpac.

Upon completion of their Westpac deployment in July 1993, the squadron stopped briefly at MCAS Kaneohe Bay en route to their new home at MCAS El Toro, California, ending a sixteen-year absence. In October 1993, a significant milestone was reached when members of the Hornet Industry Team presented the squadron with a plaque honoring the Red Devils for achieving 50,000 accident free flight hours. This achievement spans almost 13 years of flying in the F-4 and F/A-18.

The squadron returned to Iwakuni in February 1996 and began what was to be a most memorable WestPac. While deployed to WestPac, the squadron achieved two impressive milestones. The squadron was honored as it received both the 1995 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award as they surpassed 66,000 hours and 17 years of mishap free flying, and the 1996 Marine Corps Aviation Association&#x27;s, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year Award. VMFA-232 returned to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in August 1996.

===Global War on Terror===
The squadron deployed to Kuwait in February 2003 and took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the three and a half weeks of the war the squadron flew 1,150 hours during 540 sorties dropping 620,000 pounds of ordnance. The squadron returned to MCAS Miramar in May 2003. In 2005, VMFA-232 became part of the United States Navy&#x27;s Carrier Air Wing 11. In May 2005 they deployed with the rest of CVW-11 aboard the to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf, participating in combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and multinational exercises with Japan, Egypt, and India until November 2005.
Early in the &quot;Nimitz&quot; deployment, several of the squadron members were interviewed for the PBS documentary &quot;Carrier&quot;. In 2007 the squadron deployed on the Nimitz again for a six-month cruise to the Persian Gulf. Four months later they did another WestPac deployment on the Nimitz. In January 2010 VMFA-232 accepted two F/A-18D Hornet aircraft and left in May 2010 for a deployment to Kandahar, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While in Afghanistan the Red Devils flew 4,090 Flight hours encompassing 1190 sorties and dropped 240,000 lbs of ordnance and expended 30,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition. They returned to MCAS Miramar in November 2010.

===2015 Crash===
On 21 October 2015, an F/A-18C of VMFA-232 crashed in East Anglia, United Kingdom near the airbases at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. The aircraft was reportedly one of six transitting through RAF Lakenheath following a deployment in the Middle East. It was reported the pilot, identified as Major Taj Sareen, ejected but did not survive the event.

<text>Sally Clare Kellerman (June 2, 1937 – February 24, 2022) was an American actress whose acting career spanned 60 years. Her role as Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan in Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970) earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. After &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, she appeared in a number of the director&#x27;s projects, namely the films &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970), &quot;Welcome to L.A.&quot; (1976) (produced by Altman, directed by his protégé, Alan Rudolph), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), and &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), and the short-lived anthology TV series &quot;Gun&quot; (1997). In addition to her work with Altman, Kellerman appeared in films such as &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (1972), &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), plus many television series such as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (1963), &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (1963 &amp; 1965), &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1966, 1970), &quot;The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman&quot; (2006), &quot;90210&quot; (2008), &quot;Chemistry&quot; (2011), and &quot;Maron&quot; (2013). She also voiced Miss Finch in &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot; (1985), which went on to become one of her most significant voice roles.

At age 18, Kellerman signed a recording contract with Verve Records, but her first album (&quot;Roll with the Feelin″&quot; on the Decca label) was not recorded until 1972. A second album &quot;Sally&quot; was released in 2009. Kellerman also contributed songs to the soundtracks for &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970), &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973), &quot;Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins&quot; (1975), and &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot; (1992).

Kellerman did commercial voiceover work for Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, Mercedes-Benz, and Revlon. Kellerman&#x27;s animation work included &quot;The Mouse and His Child&quot; (1977), &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1990), &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (1992), &quot;Unsupervised&quot; (2012), and &quot;The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange&quot; (2013). In 2013, she released her memoir &quot;Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood Life&quot;, describing her trials and tribulations in the entertainment business.

==Early life==
Kellerman was born in Long Beach, California, on June 2, 1937 to Edith Baine (née Vaughn), a piano teacher from Portland, Arkansas, and John Helm &quot;Jack&quot; Kellerman, a Shell Oil executive from St. Louis, Missouri. She had an older sister, Diana Dean Kellerman. Her younger sister, Victoria Vaughn Kellerman, died in infancy. Edith was a Christian Scientist and raised her daughters in this faith.

When Kellerman was in fifth grade, the family moved from Long Beach to the San Fernando Valley. She spent her early life in then-rural Granada Hills in a largely unpopulated area surrounded by orange and eucalyptus groves. During her sophomore year of high school, the Kellermans moved from San Fernando to Park La Brea, Los Angeles, where she attended Hollywood High School. She grew to stand 5&#x27;10 1/2&quot; (179.07 cms). Due to her shyness, she made few friends and received poor grades (except in choir and physical education) but appeared in a school production of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

With the help of a high-school friend, Kellerman submitted a recording demo to Verve Records founder and head Norman Granz. After signing a contract with Verve, however, she was daunted by the task of becoming a recording artist and walked away.

Kellerman attended Los Angeles City College, and also enrolled in Jeff Corey&#x27;s acting class. Within a year, she appeared in a production of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; staged by Corey and featuring classmates Shirley Knight, Jack Nicholson, Dean Stockwell, and Robert Blake. Towards the end of the 1950s, Kellerman joined the newly opened Actors Studio West and debuted before the camera in the film, &quot;Reform School Girl&quot; (1957). To pay her tuition, Kellerman worked as a waitress at Chez Paulette.

==Career==
===1960s===
Kellerman made a number of television-series appearances. She was in an episode of the western &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, as well as a role as a waitress in the John Forsythe sitcom &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;. Struggling for parts in television and films, Kellerman acted on stage. She debuted in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, followed by parts in a Pasadena Playhouse production of Leslie Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; and Michael Shurtleff&#x27;s &quot;Call Me by My Rightful Name&quot; (1962).
Kellerman appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, first in 1963 in the episode &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, and then in 1964 in the episode &quot;The Bellero Shield&quot; in which she played Judith Bellero, the manipulative and ruthless wife of Richard Bellero (played by Martin Landau). In between her two &quot;Outer Limits&quot; appearances, she was a guest in an episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. A role as Holly Mitchell, perverted mistress of George Peppard&#x27;s character in &quot;The Third Day&quot; (1965), followed. She played leading lady to David Niven in his television series &quot;The Rogues&quot; in 1965 for an episode titled &quot;God Bless You, G. Carter Huntington&quot; which revolved around her striking beauty to a large degree, and appeared in a 1965 &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; episode titled &quot;Thou Still Unravished Bride&quot;.

A year later, she played psychiatrist Elizabeth Dehner (who studied the long-term effects of space on a crew) in &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the second pilot for &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Three months after that, Kellerman played Mag Wildwood in the original Broadway production of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, directed by Joseph Anthony and produced by David Merrick, which closed after four preview performances. Before the closing the musical numbers were recorded live, and she recorded three songs which appeared on the original cast recording.

Near the end of the decade, Kellerman guest-starred in &quot;The Invaders&quot; in the episode &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1968). She also had turns as the severely beaten (and only surviving) victim of Albert DeSalvo in , and Phyllis Brubaker (Jack Lemmon&#x27;s materialistic wife) in the romantic comedy &quot;The April Fools&quot; (1969). She turned down a role in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969). She played Eleanor in the &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episode &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; (1969).

In a 1971 &quot;Life&quot; magazine interview, Kellerman remembered her television years: &quot;It took me eight years to get into TV — and six years to get out. Frigid women, alcoholics they gave me. I got beat up, raped, and never played comedy.&quot;

===1970s===
Kellerman received her breakthrough role (Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;) in 1970. Her performance received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, winning the Kansas City Film Critics Circle (KCFCC) Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Laurel for Best Comedy Performance (Female), and a second-place National Society of Film Critics (NSFC) Award for Best Supporting Actress. Kellerman was featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. She again collaborated with Altman in &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; as Louise, guardian angel to Bud Cort, and recorded &quot;Rock-a-Bye Baby&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Her next role was as a hostile, chain-smoking, sex-addicted woman who was trying to have an afternoon affair with Alan Arkin&#x27;s character in Gene Saks&#x27; film adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s comedy &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (1972). In Manhattan after the film, Kellerman declined an offer for a ten-page spread in &quot;Vogue&quot; from the then editor-in-chief Grace Mirabella. When she refused the part of Linda Rogo in &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), Stella Stevens got the role. Shortly afterwards she recorded her first demo with Lou Adler, and &quot;Roll with the Feelin&quot; for Decca Records with producer-arranger Gene Paige. After filming &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;, Kellerman passed up a role in another Altman film:

Kellerman&#x27;s next roles included as a woman involved in a deadly plot in the slasher film &quot;A Reflection of Fear&quot; (1972); an eccentric woman in the road movie &quot;Slither&quot; opposite James Caan (1973), and a tormented journalist in Charles Jarrott&#x27;s musical remake of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (also contributing to the latter&#x27;s soundtrack). Two years later, she played Mackinley Beachwood in Dick Richards&#x27; &quot;Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins&quot; (1975), one of two women who kidnap driving instructor—and former United States Marine Corps gunnery sergeant—Rafferty (Alan Arkin), also singing &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot;.

In October 1975, Kellerman sang at Reno Sweeney, and performed two shows nightly at the Rainbow Grill from November 25 to December 14. Her next appearance was as Sybil Crane (a woman in the midst of a divorce) in &quot;The Big Bus&quot;, a parody of disaster films, followed by a role as a lonely real estate agent in the Alan Rudolph-directed and Altman-produced &quot;Welcome to L.A.&quot; (both 1976). The next year, Kellerman appeared in a week-long run of cabaret concerts beginning at the Grand Finale club on May 2. Songs that evening included versions of Leon Russell and Betty Everett hits.

At the end of the decade, Kellerman&#x27;s roles included Maureen, a veteran vaudevillian, in &quot;&quot; (1978); Veronica Sterling, a party-addicted socialite, in the made-for-television film &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Sweet&quot; (1978); and Lise Bockweiss—one of several wives of Pasquinel (Robert Conrad) and daughter of Herman Bockweiss (Raymond Burr)—in the 12-episode miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978–1979). Kellerman played Kay King, the pretentious and kooky mother of a lovelorn daughter (Diane Lane), in George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;A Little Romance&quot; (1979).

===1980s===

Kellerman began the decade as Mary, a divorced middle-aged suburban mother struggling to raise her rebellious daughter (Jodie Foster) in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s &quot;Foxes&quot; (1980); Martha, a six-times-married eccentric, in Bill Persky&#x27;s &quot;Serial&quot;, and the silly-but-sophisticated Mrs. Liggett in Jack Smight&#x27;s &quot;Loving Couples&quot;. Her later roles included Mary, a child psychiatrist in a sadomasochistic relationship with a psychology professor (Stephen Lackman) after they meet by accident (literally) in Michael Grant&#x27;s &quot;Head On&quot;, and a 1920s socialite in Kirk Browning&#x27;s made-for-television film adaptation of Dorothy Parker&#x27;s 1929 short story &quot;Big Blonde&quot; (both 1980). From October 3 to November 15, 1980, Kellerman starred as Julia Seton in an Ahmanson Theatre production of Philip Barry&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot; (directed by Robert Allan Ackerman) with Kevin Kline, Maurice Evans, and Marisa Berenson.

On February 7, 1981, Kellerman hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing in four sketches (&quot;Monologue&quot;, &quot;The Audition&quot;, &quot;Was I Ever Red&quot;, and &quot;Lean Acres&quot;) and closing the show with Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Starting Over Again&quot;. Kellerman&#x27;s next performances were in made-for-television films. She played the title character&#x27;s first wife, Maxine Cates, in &quot;Dempsey&quot; and a honky-tonk dance-hall proprietress in &quot;September Gun&quot;. That year she also appeared in a stage production, Tom Eyen&#x27;s R-rated spoof of 1940s women&#x27;s prison films &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;. Kellerman played Gloria, a tough inmate who controls the other prisoners.

Her next roles were a KGB-training-school warden in the made-for-television film, &quot;Secret Weapons&quot; (1985); the sadomasochistic Judge Nedra Henderson in &quot;Moving Violations&quot; (1985); Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s love interest in Alan Metter&#x27;s comedy &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986); Julie Andrews&#x27; and Jack Lemmon&#x27;s eccentric neighbor in Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; (1986); a porn star trying to get into heaven in &quot;Meatballs III: Summer Job&quot; (1986); Kerri Green&#x27;s mother in &quot;Three for the Road&quot; (1987), and an actress in Henry Jaglom&#x27;s &quot;Someone to Love&quot;. Late in the decade, Kellerman planned to release her second album, which would have included &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be Bad, It&#x27;s Bad to Be Good&quot; from 1992&#x27;s &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot; (which she produced and starred in as Natasha Fatale); however, the album never was released.

===1990s===
In 1992, there was a fourth collaboration between Kellerman and Altman in &quot;The Player&quot;, in which she appeared as herself. Supporting roles followed in Percy Adlon&#x27;s &quot;Younger and Younger&quot; (1993), &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; (1993) and &quot;Mirror, Mirror II: Raven Dance&quot; (1994), the sequel of the Yvonne De Carlo and Karen Black horror film &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. The actress appeared in another Altman film, &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), as Sissy Wanamaker, editor-in-chief of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, with Tracey Ullman and Linda Hunt. During filming, Altman flew Kellerman and co-star Lauren Bacall from Paris for his tribute at Lincoln Center. From April 18 to May 21, 1995, Kellerman played the title role in the Maltz Jupiter Theatre production of &quot;Mame&quot;. Around this time, Kellerman appeared in back-to-back plays in Boston and Edmonton. In Boston, she played Martha in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, and starred as Mary Jane Dankworth in a two-month, two-character production of &quot;Lay of the Land&quot; with Michael Hogan in Edmonton. That year Kellerman planned to release her second album, &quot;Something Kool&quot;, featuring songs from the 1950s.

In 1996, Kellerman played a calculating sister in an episode of &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, &quot;Sister in Sex Triangle with Gazillionaire!&quot; A year later, she collaborated with Altman for the last time in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Women&quot;, an episode of the director&#x27;s TV series &quot;Gun&quot;. The actress then co-produced and reprised her Canadian stage role in a film version of &quot;The Lay of the Land&quot;.

In 1997, Kellerman was scheduled to play the title role in &quot;Mrs. Scrooge: A Slightly Different Christmas Carol&quot;, a made-for-TV film version of Charles Dickens&#x27; novella. In the film, Mrs. Scrooge is a homophobic widow whose late partner (Jacob Marley) and three other spirits awaken her to the reality of AIDS. Although it was never released, the actress told a reporter for &quot;The Advocate&quot; why the project was more personal than professional: &quot;My sister’s gay—and was gay before it was popular... My sister is a very loving person. So is her girlfriend. And my daughter is an amazing woman. They’re all heroic in my book.&quot;

Kellerman appeared in the 1998 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. On June 10, 1999, Kellerman joined actresses Kathleen Turner and Beverly Peele in a Planned Parenthood press conference supporting a proposed law introduced to the U.S. Congress.

===2000s===
At the beginning of the century, Kellerman appeared in Canon Theatre&#x27;s production of Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; with Teri Hatcher and Regina Taylor.
This was followed by a cabaret show at Feinstein&#x27;s at the Regency, which opened with Helen Reddy&#x27;s &quot;I Am Woman&quot;. Other songs ranged from Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;The Way We Were&quot; to &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. In March 2002, Kellerman performed in Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;What a Pair&quot;, a benefit for breast cancer research, joining singer-songwriter Julia Fordham for &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I&quot;. That year, the actress also played protagonist Judge Marcia Blackwell in the made-for-television film &quot;Verdict in Blood&quot;. This was followed by another cabaret show, produced by Hal David, at the Palmdale Playhouse. Songs included Etta James&#x27; &quot;Sunday Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;Long Way From St. Louis&quot;. An album (&quot;Body Parts&quot;) was planned, but never released.

In the summer of 2004, Kellerman played host Madame ZinZanni in &quot;Teatro ZinZanni&quot;. That year she also received the Susan B. Anthony &quot;Failure is Impossible&quot; Award, honoring women in the film industry who have overcome adversity, at the High Falls Film Festival. Kellerman returned to the stage for a second &quot;What a Pair&quot; concert, joining actress Lauren Frost for &quot;I&#x27;m Past My Prime&quot;. The next year, she played Dolores Montoya in Blank Theatre Company&#x27;s Los Angeles revival of &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, followed by the sexually-provocative Sandy in Susan Seidelman&#x27;s &quot;Boynton Beach Club&quot;. Kellerman sang Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; with actress, singer and songwriter Kathleen &quot;Bird&quot; York at her third (and final) &quot;What a Pair&quot; concert. In 2006 the actress appeared as herself in the first episode of the IFC&#x27;s &quot;The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman&quot;, &quot;A Cult Classic&quot;.
In September 2008, Kellerman recorded a duet with Ray Brown Jr. (son of Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Brown), &quot;I Thought About You&quot;, for Brown&#x27;s duet CD &quot;Friends and Family&quot;. In 2009, Kellerman released a jazz and blues album, &quot;Sally&quot;, her first since &quot;Roll with the Feelin″&quot;. &quot;Sally&quot; featured interpretations of songs by Linda Ronstadt, Kim Carnes, Aerosmith, Nina Simone, the Motels, Neil Diamond, Jackson Browne, Marvin Gaye, Dolly Parton, Jennifer Warnes, and James Taylor. That year she also played Donette, owner of a small-town diner, in the made-for-television film &quot;The Wishing Well&quot;.

===2010s===
Kellerman starred with Ernest Borgnine and Mickey Rooney in &quot;Night Club&quot; (2011). Her performance as a woman with Alzheimer&#x27;s living in a retirement home won an Accolade Competition Award for Best Supporting Actress. That year she played a recurring role as Lola (an eccentric artist) in Cinemax&#x27;s sexually explicit comedy-drama series &quot;Chemistry&quot;, followed by guest appearances on the CW teen drama series &quot;90210&quot; as Marla, an aging Hollywood actress with dementia who considers assisted suicide. On July 7, 2012, Kellerman appeared with Tito Ortiz, Cary Elwes, and Drake Bell in an episode of the Biography Channel&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot;.

On April 30, 2013, the actress released her memoir, &quot;Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood Life&quot;, published by Weinstein Books. In the book, she remembered a close-knit, family-oriented past Hollywood and her triumphs and tribulations as an actress during the 1960s. Kellerman made promotional book-signing appearances in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Manhattan, and Jersey City. Shortly afterward, she appeared as Marc Maron&#x27;s bohemian mother in the &quot;Dead Possum&quot; episode of his comedy series.

Kellerman later received a Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival (FLIFF) Lifetime Achievement Award at Cinema Paradiso in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The ceremony, which included a montage of her work and an audience question-and-answer session, was moderated by film historian Foster Hirsch. In September 2013 filmmaker Ellen Houlihan released a short film &quot;Joan&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, in which Kellerman played a grandmother who escapes from her assisted-living facility to bail her teenage granddaughter out of prison. The actress joined the &quot;Love Can Initiative&quot;, a nonprofit organization dedicated to enriching the lives of low income families and their children, in February 2014. Kellerman made a return appearance in the second season of &quot;Maron&quot; in the episode &quot;Mom Situation&quot;, and as part of an Epix Network documentary celebrating the life of Robert Altman on August 6, 2014.

In October 2014, TVLine announced that Kellerman had been cast in the mysterious role of Constance Bingham on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy as Best Actress in a Guest Role. In 2016, she continued her recurring role on &quot;Maron&quot; and played in five episodes of the new series &quot;Decker&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1961, Kellerman underwent a botched home abortion, and went to a hospital for the first time (due to her Christian Science upbringing). The relationship that had caused her terminated pregnancy was with bit actor William Duffy.

In the late 1960s, she was briefly involved with actor-screenwriter Lawrence Hauben. Hauben shot a documentary, &quot;Venus&quot;, about their relationship, which received a very limited theatrical release in 1971. 

After the release of &quot;MASH&quot;, on December 17, 1970, Kellerman married &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; producer Rick Edelstein.
Anjanette Comer, Joanne Linville, and Luana Anders were among her bridesmaids. On March 6, 1972, Kellerman divorced Edelstein, citing irreconcilable differences. &quot;We&#x27;ve fought every day since we&#x27;ve met,&quot; she said at the time.

In 1967, Kellerman&#x27;s sister, Diana, came out as a lesbian and separated from her husband, Ian Charles Cargill Graham, who took full custody of the couple&#x27;s daughter, Claire. After Diana moved to France with her partner, she did not communicate with her daughter for eight years. Sally adopted Claire on January 30, 1976, and on April 10, Ian Graham died in Edinburgh, Scotland.

For a time in the mid-1970s, Kellerman was involved with Mark Farner of the rock group Grand Funk Railroad. He wrote the song &quot;Sally&quot;, from the 1976 album &quot;Born to Die&quot;, as an ode to their relationship. She also dated screenwriters David Rayfiel and Charles Shyer, as well as journalist Warren Hoge, producer Jon Peters, and actor Edd Byrnes. In her autobiography, Kellerman made a point to note that her romance with Byrnes was never consummated.

On May 11, 1980, Kellerman married producer Jonathan D. Krane in a private ceremony at Jennifer Jones&#x27;s Malibu home. In 1989, the couple adopted newborn twins, Jack Donald and Hanna Vaughan, who were born on June 24 of that year. The family relocated to Jupiter, Florida in 1991. After encountering financial difficulties, they sold their condo there in 2008 and moved back to Hollywood.

Jonathan Krane died of a heart attack on August 1, 2016, aged 64. Their adopted daughter, Hanna Krane, died on October 22, 2016, at age 27 from heroin and methamphetamine use.

Kellerman and Krane separated twice during their 36-year marriage, first for a few months in 1994, then again during 1997–98 over Krane&#x27;s public affair with Nastassja Kinski. As Kellerman had dated married men in the past, she forgave her husband for the affair.

Kellerman died from heart failure at a care facility in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, on February 24, 2022, at the age of 84. At the time of her death, she had dementia.

<doc id="994023" wikidata="Q5321784" url="?curid=994023" title="E. C. Row Expressway">
<text>The E. C. Row Expressway is a municipal expressway in the city of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It divides the city in half as it crosses it between the Ojibway Parkway in the west and Banwell Road in the east, a distance of . It was built between 1971 and 1983, reaching completion across the city on June 9, 1983. It was part of Highway 2 and Highway 18 until the province transferred ownership and responsibility for the route to the City of Windsor on April 1, 1997. In 2015, the westernmost was significantly upgraded as part of the Highway 401 extension (Herb Gray Parkway) project. The freeway is named after Edgar Charles Row, the president of Chrysler Canada between 1951 and 1956.

While allowing for easy travel across the city, the E.C. Row Expressway was isolated for much of its existence as it did not connect directly to the United States nor Highway 401; drivers had to access the Ambassador Bridge via Huron Church Road, or the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel via Dougall Parkway, both surface streets were also needed to reach Highway 401. This situation is being rectified from 2011 onward, as the expressway&#x27;s western terminus is located at the port of entry for the Gordie Howe International Bridge scheduled for completion , with slip ramps to access the bridge-bound portion of Highway 401.

== Route description ==
The E.C. Row Expressway is a route with a speed limit of . It begins at a signalized intersection with the Ojibway Parkway, curving gently from northeastward to eastward. It travels east-northeast as a four lane fully controlled-access freeway with a grass median and grade-separated interchanges.

After crossing Matchette Road, where ramps provide access to and from the eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Slip ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the eastbound carriageway of the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.

The highway quickly meets another interchange at Howard Avenue, where it also crosses Turkey Creek and the former alignment of Grand Marais Road. Southeast of this interchange is Devonshire Mall while to the north are low-density commercial units. East of the interchange, the E. C. Row once again travels between residential subdivisions. To the north lies Remington Park while to the south is Devonshire Heights. Crossing into Walkerville at a diamond interchange with Walker Road, the highway becomes surrounded by a business park; the Walker Road interchange also connects with the Central Avenue interchange. This also marks the end of the illuminated section of the expressway.

Now north of Windsor Airport, the route crosses over the Canadian Pacific Windsor Subdivision just west of a partial interchange with Jefferson Boulevard, which provides westbound access to and eastbound access from the expressway. The route passes south of the Ford Essex Engine Plant before meeting the Lauzon Parkway at an interchange. It crosses Little River before entering an area with a subdivision to the north and a commercial park to the south. The commercial zoning eventually transitions to agricultural fields, and the E. C. Row Expressway curves northeast and intersects Banwell Road at-grade. East of Banwell Road, the road continues as the Pike Creek Bypass, former Highway 2.

== History ==
The history of the E.C. Row Expressway dates back to January 1963, when the City of Windsor and the Department of Highways released a report called The Windsor Area Transportation Study (WATS). One of the primary issues identified by the study was &quot;a limited and inadequate street network in the east-west direction generally resulting from several railway barriers&quot;.
Properties were purchased along E.C. Row Avenue (named in 1956 after the retiring president of Chrysler Canada 
(1951-1956), Ohio-born E. C. Row) and the Third Concession within Sandwich Township beginning in 1958 for what was then intended as a two-lane road linking Highway 18 with Highway 39 (which became Highway 2 in 1970). However, with the release of WATS and the subsequent amalgamation in 1966 in which Windsor annexed portions of the surrounding townships, plans for an expressway along the corridor were first conceived.
The original plans for the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to travel from current County Road 22, heading west along the southern edge of Belle River and Tecumseh, meeting up with the current two-lane freeway alignment (Pike Creek Bypass) just east of Puce, as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg.

The first stage of construction began in 1970 to bridge the two sections of E.C. Row Avenue over the CN railway line between Dougall Avenue (then Highway 3B) and Howard Avenue (a former alignment of Highway 2);
this work was completed in 1973.
In 1976, contracts were awarded to extend the new divided expressway east to Walker Avenue.
At the request of Ford Motor Company of Canada, construction on the expressway was soon accelerated. By early 1980, the existing construction contracts were completed, and work began to connect the expressway between Huron Church Road and Dougall Avenue.
Construction of a two-laned extension west to connect with the Ojibway Parkway (Highway 18) began by the end of that year.
The expressway was opened between Central Avenue and Lauzon Parkway on December19, 1980.
The final section, connecting with Highway 2 as a two lane expressway at Banwell Road, opened the week of May4, 1981. The unsignalised intersection with Shawnee Road was quickly recognised as a hazard. As a result, Westlake Drive was built and Shawnee closed at the expressway in late 1983.
By April 1982, the four-laned expressway was complete between Huron Church Road and east of Lauzon Parkway,
and with Ojibway Parkway via a two-lane expressway west of Huron Church Road. Following this, Highway 2 was rerouted west of Banwell Road off Tecumseth Road to instead travel along the expressway, while Highway 18 was rerouted off Sandwich Street to followed the expressway; both then followed Highway 3 along Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge.

Construction stalled for several years as funding was diverted from the project during a recession in the early 1980s. It would take until 1987 for work to resume to replace the at-grade intersections at Matchette Road, Malden Road, Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard. The City of Windsor nevertheless earmarked funding from their budget to build the last two of those interchanges in late 1986.
The province later stepped in to provide a share of the funding in March 1987,
and work began with contracts being awarded for construction on August 26 and September 16 of that year for interchanges at Dominion Boulevard and Huron Church Road, respectively.
The City of Windsor also negotiated with the province for funding of an interchange at Matchette Road in late April of that year,
which was approved by September 1.
On September 29, 1988, the Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard interchanges were opened to traffic.

Work began in October 1989 to twin the existing two-laned route between the Ojibway Parkway and Huron Church Road by building a second parallel roadway to serve as the eastbound lanes. Construction of a partial interchange at Matchette Road as well as an overpass of Malden Road was included in this project,
which was completed in September 1990. The project to complete the expressway in the east — by twinning the route between Lauzon Parkway and the Windsor boundary east of Banwell Road — began immediately after; it was completed in late 1991.
The overall cost of the expressway between Ojibway Parkway and Banwell Road, originally estimated (in 1967) at $55 million, was $115 million, out of which the province contributed $94 million.

Planning subsequently began to extend the expressway east to Manning Road along the existing two-lane Pike Creek Bypass.
However, budget constraints brought on by a recession in the early 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the &quot;Who Does What?&quot; committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred under premier Bob Rae.
It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer served long-distance traffic movement and should, therefore, be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network.
As the E. C. Row Expressway was designed to serve commuter traffic in Windsor, and not province-wide movement, the route was transferred to the City of Windsor on April 1, 1997.
No work has progressed on the extension since.

Beginning in 2011, the E.C. Row Expressway west of Huron Church Road underwent a complete reconstruction as part of the $1.4 billion Herb Gray Parkway project which included a major realignment of of the eastbound carriageway between Matchette Road and Huron Church Road to allow for an extension of Highway 401 to travel within their median, while the westbound lanes of the E.C. Row remained largely unchanged except for the addition of streetlights. The project was completed on November 21, 2015 and allows E.C. Row traffic to connect with the bridge-bound portion of Highway 401 via slip ramps located east of Machete Road. The E.C. Row still lacks direct access to the London-bound portion of Highway 401, however, the completion of phase one of the Highway 401 extension (Herb Gray Parkway) means that the indirect connection using Huron Church Road has been reduced to a short distance (with one traffic light) between the Parclo A4 interchange with the E.C. Row and the slip ramps with Highway 401.

In 2015, construction began on the widening and expansion of E.C. Row&#x27;s eastern extension, County Road 22. The highway was widened to four lanes from Banwell Road to E Puce Road (County Road 25) in Puce. As of 2018, this project has been completed and includes a roundabout at the intersection of County Road 22 and Old Tecumseh Road

<doc id="994024" wikidata="Q716958" url="?curid=994024" title="Waltheof of Melrose">
<text>Waltheof (–1159) was a 12th-century English abbot and saint. He was the son of Simon I of St Liz, 1st Earl of Northampton and Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, thus stepson to David I of Scotland, and the grandson of Waltheof, Earl of Northampton.

Whether as a result of being a younger son in the world of Norman succession laws, or being personally unsuited to court life, Waltheof chose a career in the church. Between 1128 and 1131 he entered Nostell Priory to become an Augustinian canon. His noble connections enabled him to rise quickly, and by 1139 he was Prior of Kirkham, North Yorkshire. Upon the death of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, in 1140, Waltheof was nominated to be his successor. His candidacy was supported by William of Aumale, the Earl of York. Stephen, probably sensing his links to David and hence to the Empress Matilda were too strong, rejected the nomination. William of Aumale withdrew his support after Waltheof refused to promise to give the earl the ecclesiastical manor of Sherburn-in-Elmet in the West Riding of Yorkshire. William fitz Herbert was instead chosen by Stephen. Waltheof featured prominently among those opposing William&#x27;s provision, but by 1143 he had given up and become a Cistercian monk, first at Wardon Abbey and then at Rievaulx Abbey. In 1148 he was elected to the abbacy of Melrose, a daughter house of Rievaulx. Waltheof remained in this position for the remainder of his life, even though he was offered the bishopric of St Andrews in early 1159, which he declined. He died at Melrose Abbey on 3 August 1159.

Following the death of Waltheof, his successor as Abbot of Melrose, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours that were spreading regarding Waltheof&#x27;s saintliness. Abbot William attempted to silence these rumours, and prevent the intrusiveness of would-be pilgrims. However, William was unable to get the better of Waltheof&#x27;s emerging cult, and his actions alienated him from his brethren. As a result, in April 1170, William resigned the abbacy. In William&#x27;s place, Jocelin, the prior of Melrose, became abbot. Jocelin had no such scruples and embraced the cult without hesitation. In the entry for the year of Jocelin&#x27;s accession, the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; reads:
The tomb of our pious father, sir Waltheof, the second abbot of Melrose, was opened by Enguerrand, of good memory, the bishop of Glasgow, and by four abbots called in for this purpose; and his body was found entire, and his vestments intact, in the twelfth year from his death, on the eleventh day before the Kalends of June [22 May]. And after the holy celebration of mass, the same bishop, and the abbots whose number we have mentioned above, placed over the remains of his most holy body a new stone of polished marble. And there was great gladness; those who were present exclaiming together, and saying that truly this was a man of God.

Later, as bishop of Glasgow, Jocelin continued the promotion of sainthood and commissioned a hagiography of Saint Kentigern, the saint most venerated by the Celts of the diocese of Glasgow. It is no coincidence that Jocelin of Furness, who wrote the &quot;Life of St. Waltheof&quot;, was the same man later commissioned to write the &quot;Life of St. Kentigern&quot;. Jocelin&#x27;s actions ensured Waltheof&#x27;s posthumous &quot;de facto&quot; sainthood; and the need of Melrose Abbey to have its own saint&#x27;s cult ensured the cult&#x27;s longevity.

<text>A mobile (, ) is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take advantage of the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a number of rods, from which weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs from only one string, which gives it the freedom to rotate about the string. An ensemble of these balanced parts hang freely in space, by design without coming into contact with each other.

Mobiles are popular in the nursery, where they hang over cribs to give infants entertainment and visual stimulation. Mobiles have inspired many composers, including Morton Feldman and Earle Brown who were inspired by Alexander Calder&#x27;s mobiles to create mobile-like indeterminate pieces. John Cage wrote the music for the short film Works of Calder that focused on Calder&#x27;s mobiles. Frank Zappa stated that his compositions employ a principle of balance similar to Calder mobiles.

== Origin ==

The meaning of the term &quot;mobile&quot; as applied to sculpture has evolved since it was first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized creations of Alexander Calder. At this point, &quot;mobile&quot; was synonymous with the term &quot;kinetic art&quot;, describing sculptural works in which motion is a defining property. While motor or crank-driven moving sculptures may have initially prompted it, the word &quot;mobile&quot; later came to refer more specifically to Calder&#x27;s free-moving creations. Calder in many respects invented an art form where objects (typically brightly coloured, abstract shapes fashioned from sheet metal) are connected by wire much like a balance scale. By the sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of many balanced parts joined by lengths of wire whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Thus, &quot;mobile&quot; has become a more well-defined term with its origin in the many such hanging constructs Calder produced in a prolific manner between the 1930s and his death in 1976.

== Similar works ==


Calder&#x27;s work is the only one defined by the term &quot;mobile&quot;; however, three other notable artists worked on a similar concept. Man Ray experimented with this idea around 1920, Armando Reverón who during the 30s made a series of movable skeletons and
Bruno Munari created his &quot;Useless Machines&quot; in 1933, made in cardboard and playful colors. Also Julio Le Parc, Grand Prize winner at the Venice Biennale in 1966.

<text>MAT Macedonian Airlines (, tr: &quot;Makedonski Aviotransport (MAT)&quot;) was the national flag carrier airline of the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia). It operated scheduled services between Skopje and Ohrid and several destinations in Europe. It was based in Skopje with its main base at Skopje International Airport.

== History ==
Macedonian Air Transport was established on 16 January 1994 and started operations on 23 June 1994 flying from Skopje to Zürich using a Boeing 737-200.

In 2000, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia signed an agreement with MAT that gave MAT the status of national flag carrier for the following 10 years.
MAT Macedonian Air Transport is a share holding private Company, owned by two major stockholders.

In 2007, MAT introduced electronic tickets available for purchase over the internet.

===Final years (2008-2009)===

On 31 October 2008, MAT received its first Boeing 737-500. The aircraft had 126 seats divided in two cabin classes (business and economy) and 4 tons capacity for baggage and cargo. The registration of the aircraft was Z3-AAH and it carried MAT traditional colors.

In December 2008, the airline was forced to give up its services from Skopje to Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Rome after Eurocontrol banned the carrier from entering German and Italian airspace because of unpaid air traffic control fees from the period 1999 to 2005.

MAT Airlines was also banned from Greek airspace, because of the Macedonia naming dispute. In 2009, the Greek and Macedonian states agreed on their aircraft entering each other&#x27;s airspace, but Macedonian registered aircraft could not land in any Greek airports.

In 2009, MAT dismissed 70 of 180 employees and changed its airplanes to reduce costs.

On 20 March 2009, Jat Airways, the national flag carrier airline of Serbia, announced its intentions of taking over a majority of shares in MAT Macedonian Airlines.

On 14 May 2009, a Boeing 737-500 was grounded by Macedonian CAA and stored at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport until 4 July 2009.

On 1 September 2009, MAT Macedonian Airlines lost its Air Operators Certificate (AOC).

==Planned takeover by Jat==
MAT Macedonian Airlines and Jat Airways signed the Intention agreement on finding the best business solution for the future cooperation between the two national carriers of Macedonia and Serbia. Both companies stated that the interest is shown for establishing various forms of cooperation, from technical to commercial.

In the year 2008 Alexander The Great Airport provided service to more than 660.000 passengers while MAT served 37 per cent on the flights to Zurich, Vienna, Düsseldorf, Rome, Istanbul, Hamburg, Berlin and Amsterdam and Jat served 10 per cent. By improving the companies’ partnership, services for the Macedonian passengers will gain additional possibilities.

The agreement was signed in Belgrade by Jat Acting Director General Sasa Vlaisavljevic and the president of MAT&#x27;s Board of Directors, Zlatko Petrovski.

Despite MAT recently being grounded by aviation authorities in Macedonia, Jat&#x27;s CEO has confirmed that the Serbian carrier will take over shares and revive the national Macedonian carrier. Jat&#x27;s team of legal experts are currently in Skopje where they are checking MAT&#x27;s legal and financial documentation. These checks should be complete within a week. The findings will be presented to Jat&#x27;s management board, after which, the Serbian carrier will send MAT a proposal whether it will take over a majority of shares (over 50%) or less than 50% of shares. The documentation checks have taken longer than expected because MAT did not immediately provide all the necessary paperwork. Also, Jat&#x27;s legal team requested more information regarding MAT&#x27;s financial reports. Jat&#x27;s CEO confirmed that MAT has extreme debt but declined to comment further. He stated that Jat is primarily interested in the Macedonian aviation market which is covered 35% by MAT, while Jat has a share of 10% in the market. “We are also interested in commencing flights from Belgrade and Skopje to Priština through MAT”, Saša Vlaisavljević, the airline&#x27;s CEO says. Jat is currently banned from flying to Priština due to the unresolved status of Kosovo in which Priština is located.

In October 2009, Jat Airways does not have any intentions with MAT Macedonian Airlines, instead they have planned an airline for Republic of Macedonia called Aeromak.

She married Ali Akbar Daryush, a Persian government official whom she had met when he was studying at the University of Oxford, and thereafter spent some time in Persia; most of her life was spent at the Bridges&#x27; family home, Stockwell, in Boars Hill, outside Oxford.

The garden of their Boars Hill home was left by Ali as a memorial garden, named after Elizabeth, and managed by the Oxford Preservation Trust.

===Poetry===
Daryush, daughter of English poet laureate Robert Bridges (some of her early work was published as Elizabeth Bridges), followed her father&#x27;s lead not only in choosing poetry as her life&#x27;s work but also in the traditional style of poetry she chose to write. The themes of her work are often critical of the upper classes and the social injustice their privilege levied upon others. This characteristic was not present in her early work, including her first two books of poems, published under the name Elizabeth Bridges, which appeared while she was still in her twenties. According to John Finlay, writing in the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;, Daryush&#x27;s &quot;early poetry is preoccupied with rather conventional subject matter and owes a great deal to the Edwardians.&quot;

===Syllabic style===
Daryush took her father&#x27;s experiment in syllabic verse a step farther by making it less experimental; whereas Bridges&#x27; syllable count excluded elidable syllables, producing some variation in the total number of pronounced syllables per line, Daryush&#x27;s was strictly aural, counting all syllables actually sounded when the poem was read aloud. It is for her successful experiments with syllabic meter that Daryush is best known to contemporary readers, as exampled in her poem &quot;Accentedal&quot; in the quaternion form. Yvor Winters, the poet and critic, considered Daryush more successful in writing syllabics than was her father, noting that her poem &quot;Still-Life&quot; was her finest syllabic experiment, and also a companion-piece to &quot;Children of Wealth&quot;. Winters considered the social context of &quot;Still Life&quot;, which is nowhere mentioned, yet from which the poem draws its power.

===Characteristics===
Beyond its social content, Daryush&#x27;s work is also recognized for a consistent and well-defined personal vision. As Finlay noted, &quot;For her. . .poetry always dealt with the &#x27;stubborn fact&#x27; of life as it is, and the only consolations it offered were those of understanding and a kind of half-Christian, half-stoical acceptance of the inevitable.&quot; However, he also argued that Daryush&#x27;s best poems transcend such fatalism, &quot;dealing with the moral resources found in one&#x27;s own being. . .and a recognition of the beauties in the immediate, ordinary world around us.&quot; In many of her terse short poems, there is formal and intellectual mastery; her last, longest and most ambitious poem, &#x27;Air and Variations,&#x27; was a formal tribute to Gerard Manley Hopkins Daryush has been described as a pioneer technical innovator, a poet of the highest dedication and seriousness whose poetry grapples with life&#x27;s intensest issues.

<text>The Royal Green Jackets (RGJ) was an infantry regiment of the British Army, one of two &quot;large regiments&quot; within the Light Division (the other being The Light Infantry).

==History==
The Royal Green Jackets was formed on 1 January 1966 by the amalgamation of the three separate regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade: 
*1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)
*2nd Green Jackets, the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps
*3rd Green Jackets, the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own).

There were also two Territorial Army battalions made up as follows:
* 4th (V) Battalion, Royal Green Jackets – formed from the remnants of the Rangers (KRRC), London Rifle Brigade, Tower Hamlets Rifles, Queen&#x27;s Westminsters, Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles, Queen&#x27;s Royal Rifles and Civil Service Rifles.
* 5th (V) Battalion, Royal Green Jackets – formed from the 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (TA) and the Buckinghamshire Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry.

During the 1970s, 1980s and onwards up until the end of “The Troubles”, the battalions were deployed to various parts of Northern Ireland (Operation Banner). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions were also based in West Germany, Osnabrück (1 RGJ), Minden (2 RGJ) and Celle (3 RGJ).

The regiment&#x27;s greatest loss of life at one time came on 20 July 1982, when seven RGJ bandsmen were killed by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb while giving a public concert in Regent&#x27;s Park. The bomb exploded underneath the bandstand as the bandsmen played music from &quot;Oliver!&quot; to 120 spectators.

In 1992, 1 RGJ was disbanded and 2 RGJ and 3 RGJ renumbered 1 RGJ and 2 RGJ respectively.

After the 1992 reorganisation, the unit was mostly based overseas in Dhekelia (Cyprus) and Paderborn (Germany), as well as in Northern Ireland. It also saw action in Bosnia and Kosovo during the Yugoslav Wars. Both battalions returned to the United Kingdom by 2002 and in 2003 the 1st Battalion served on Operation Telic 2 in Iraq.

On 24 November 2005, the Ministry of Defence announced that the regiment would be amalgamated with The Light Infantry, the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry to form a single large regiment to be called The Rifles. The reorganisation into The Rifles took effect on 1 February 2007 with the 1st Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles and the 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming 4th Battalion, The Rifles. The 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets&#x27; final operational tour was in Basra, in Iraq, on Operation Telic in 2006-07.

==Regimental museum==
The Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum is based at Peninsula Barracks in Winchester.

==Traditions==
Their motto was &quot;Celer et Audax&quot; (Latin: &quot;Swift and Bold&quot;). As they were used as shock troops and marksmen, they had to get to the front line of battle as fast as was possible; as a result the RGJ marched at 140 paces per minute (at a 30&quot; pace) whereas other regiments march at just 120.

The regiment was classed as a &#x27;rifle&#x27; regiment, having its lineage in the regiments of foot that were equipped with the first Baker rifles. Traditionally, rifle regiments wore rifle green tunics, an early form of camouflage, instead of the red jackets worn by line infantry, hence the regimental name.

The cap badge was a Maltese Cross, which was drawn from the badges of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and The Rifle Brigade, with a combination of some of their battle honours on its arms.
