<text>John Smibert (24 March 1688 – 2 April 1751) was a Scottish-born painter who was the first academically trained artist to work in British America.

==Career==
Smibert was born in Edinburgh on 24 March 1688, the second youngest of six children of Alison and John Smibert, a litster, or wool dyer. From 1702 to 1709, he was apprenticed to a house painter and plasterer in Edinburgh. On moving to London in 1709 he worked as a coach painter and copyist.

1713-1716, he studied under Godfrey Kneller at the Great Queen Street Academy, then returned to Edinburgh, seeking work as portraitist. 
Smibert travelled to Italy from 1719 to 1722 to copy old masters, including some in the collection of Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and then settled in London where he worked as a portrait painter from 1722 until 1728.

Smibert became a member of the Rose and Crown Club and made a sketch for a group portrait of its members, including George Vertue, John Wootton, Thomas Gibson, Bernard Lens III, and others.

Among his London portraits is one of Bishop Berkeley who, in 1728, enticed Smibert to accompany him to America, with the intention of becoming professor of fine arts in the college which Berkeley was planning to found in Bermuda. The college, however, was never established, and Smibert settled in Boston, where he married in 1730. He lived at the corner of Brattle Street and Queen-Street. He belonged to the Scots Charitable Society of Boston.
 
In 1728, he began painting &quot;Dean George Berkeley and His Entourage&quot;, also called &quot;The Bermuda Group&quot;, which became one of the most influential New England portraits. 
It was commissioned by John Wainright, a patron of George Berkeley, and depicts the members of the planned expedition to Bermuda. The painting, now in the Yale University Art Gallery, includes Berkeley at the right, Wainwright seated at left, and Smibert standing at the far left.

Smibert painted portraits of Jonathan Edwards and Judge Edmund Quincy (in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), Mrs Smibert, Peter Faneuil and Governor John Endecott (in the Massachusetts Historical Society), John Lovell (Memorial Hall, Harvard University), and probably one of Sir William Pepperrell; and examples of his works are owned by Harvard and Yale Universities, by Bowdoin College, by the Massachusetts Historical Society, and by the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.

In 1734, Smibert opened a shop where he sold paint, other artist&#x27;s supplies, and prints. In his studio above the shop, he displayed casts and copies of Old Masters that he had painted in Europe. This collection, which Richard Saunders has termed &quot;America&#x27;s first art gallery&quot;, provided much of the early artistic education for Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart, and John Trumbull.

Between 1740 and 1742, he served as architect for the original Faneuil Hall, which he designed in the style of an English country market. The hall burned down in 1761 but was restored, and then in 1806 greatly expanded and modified by Charles Bulfinch.

His son Nathaniel was also a painter. Smibert lies in Tomb 62 in the Granary Burying Ground in Boston.

<text>Knitting is the process of using two or more needles to pull and loop yarn into a series of interconnected loops in order to create a finished garment or some other type of fabric. The word is derived from &quot;knot&quot;, thought to originate from the Dutch verb &quot;knutten&quot;, which is similar to the Old English &quot;cnyttan&quot;, &quot;to knot&quot;. Its origins lie in the basic human need for clothing for protection against the elements. More recently, hand knitting has become less a necessary skill and more of a hobby.

==Origins of knitting==
Knitting is a technique of producing fabric from a strand of yarn or wool. Unlike weaving, knitting does not require a loom or other large equipment, making it a valuable technique for nomadic and non-agrarian peoples.

The oldest knitted artifacts are socks from Egypt, dating from the 11th century. They are a very fine gauge, done with complex colourwork and some have a short row heel, which necessitates the purl stitch. These complexities suggest that knitting is even older than the archeological record can prove.

Earlier pieces having a knitted or crocheted appearance have been shown to be made with other techniques, such as Nålebinding, a technique of making fabric by creating multiple loops with a single needle and thread, much like sewing. Some artefacts have a structure so similar to knitting, for example, 3rd-5th century CE Romano-Egyptian toe-socks, that it is thought the &quot;Coptic stitch&quot; of nalbinding is the forerunner to knitting.

== Early European knitting ==
The earliest known knitted items in Europe were made by Muslim knitters employed by Spanish Christian royal families. Their high level of knitting skill can be seen in several items found in the tombs in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, a royal monastery, near Burgos, Spain. Among them are the knitted cushion covers and gloves found in the tomb of Prince Fernando de la Cerda, who died in 1275. The silk cushion cover was knitted at approximately 20 stitches per inch. It included knitted patterns reflecting the family armoury, as well as the Arabic word &quot;baraka&quot; (&quot;blessings&quot;) in stylized Kufic script. Numerous other knitted garments and accessories, also dating from the mid-13th century, have been found in cathedral treasuries in Spain.

There also is a Votic knitted fragment dated to late 13th century excavated in Estonia. This fragment is knitted in a stranded pattern in three colours and was likely part of a mitten cuff. Also, a wool mitten fragment from early 14th century has been found in Siksälä burial in South-Eastern Estonia. 

Several paintings from Europe portray the Virgin Mary knitting and date from the 14th century, including &quot;Our Lady Knitting&quot; by Tommaso da Modena (circa 1325-1375) and &quot;Visit of the Angel&quot;, from the right wing of the Buxtehude Altar, 1400–10, by Master Bertram of Minden.

Archaeological finds from medieval cities all over Europe, such as London, Newcastle, Oslo, Amsterdam, Lübeck, and Tallinn as well as tax lists, prove the spread of knitted goods for everyday use from the 14th century onward. Like many archaeological textiles, most of the finds are only fragments of knitted items so that in most cases their former appearance and use is unknown. One of the exceptions is a 14th or 15th century woollen child&#x27;s cap from Lübeck, and a cap fragment from beginning of 15th century from Tartu.

Although the purl stitch was used in some of the earliest knitted items in Egypt, its knowledge may have been lost in Europe. The first European purl stitches appear in the mid-16th century, in the red silk stockings in which Eleanora de Toledo, wife of Cosimo de Medici, was buried, and which also include the first lacy patterns made by yarn-overs, but the technique may have been developed slightly earlier. The English Queen Elizabeth I herself favoured silk stockings; these were finer, softer, more decorative and much more expensive than those of wool. Stockings reputed to have belonged to her still exist, demonstrating the high quality of the items specifically knitted for her. During this era the manufacture of stockings was of vast importance to many Britons, who knitted with fine wool and exported their wares. Knitting schools were established as a way of providing an income to the poor. The fashion of the period, requiring men to wear short trunks, made fitted stockings a fashion necessity. Stockings made in England were sent to the Netherlands, Spain and Germany.

Many elaborate designs were developed, such as the cable stitch used on Aran sweaters, which was developed in the early 20th century in Ireland.

== Importance in Scottish history ==

Knitting was such an important occupation among those living on the Scottish Isles during the 17th and 18th centuries that whole families were involved in making sweaters, accessories, socks, stockings, etc. Fair Isle techniques were used to create elaborate colourful patterns. Sweaters were essential garments for the fishermen of these islands because the natural oils within the wool provided some element of protection against the harsh weather encountered while out fishing.

== Industrial Revolution ==

The stocking frame or the mechanical knitting machine was invented in 1589 by William Lee, an English clergyman. After receiving a pair of black stockings from William, Queen Elizabeth I ultimately declined to grant him a patent for his invention. She complained that his machine-made wool stockings were far too coarse for royal ankles. She didn&#x27;t like the feel of the stockings or their crude form and she was afraid that the machine would take away jobs from her people. However, France&#x27;s King Henri IV saw the opportunity William&#x27;s invention provided and offered him financial support. The inventor moved to Rouen where he built a stocking factory. Before long, the French spread the knitting loom throughout Europe. When the device came back to Great Britain, the Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters was incorporated in 1657 in London. Framework knitting was predominantly performed at home, often with the entire family participating.

The city of Nottingham, particularly the district known as Lace Market, was a major producer of machine-knitted lace. Leicestershire and neighbouring counties had long had an association with the hosiery industry. This continued particularly growing with the invention of portable circular knitting machines. Machines could be hired and worked from home rather than relying on a large stocking frame or the much slower hand knitting. One manufacturer of these machines was Henry Josiah Griswold, they were often called Griswold knitting machines, the design of this English sock machine originates from the British inventors, Hainsworth and Griswold.

Some framework knitters were among the Luddites, who resisted the transition to factories. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the knitting industry had still not made the transition to factories. With the improvement of steam-powered knitting machines in the mid-nineteenth century, machine knitting increasingly shifted to factories to accommodate the larger machines.

By the mid-nineteenth century, hand knitting was declining as part of the knitting industry but was increasing as a hobby. Printed knitting patterns and yarn were produced for leisure as well as for industrial use by authors such as Jane Gaugain.

==1914-1918: Knitting for the war effort==

During World War I, men, women, and children knitted large quantities of clothing and accessories to help the war effort on the Allied side, supplementing the troop&#x27;s uniforms with socks, hats, scarves, sweaters, mufflers, and balaclavas. Knitting and women&#x27;s magazines along with the Red Cross published pamphlets and patterns specifically for sailors and troops. Popular magazines and songs treated knitting as a craze that had swept over Britain in the effort to support the military forces.

== 1920s: the Russian Civil Wars and China ==
After the White Russians&#x27; defeat in the Civil War, many units retreated into China&#x27;s Xinjiang and were interned there. As China was about to descend into a civil war of its own, the Russian internees were transported by camel caravans to Eastern China. According to Owen Lattimore, it was then that they passed on the art of knitting to the Chinese caravan men, who had ready supply of camel hair from their animals. In 1926, Lattimore was able to observe camel-pullers &quot;knitting on the march; if they ran out of yarn, they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting.&quot; This way the camel men not only provided themselves with warm camel-hair socks, but were able to make knitwear for sale as well.

==1920s: Fashion==
The 1920s saw a vast increase in the popularity of knitwear in much of the western world. Knitwear, especially sweaters/pullovers became an essential part of the new fashions of the age for men, women and children, rather than mostly practical garments often associated with particular occupations (e.g., fishermen). The late teens and early 1920s saw a fashion for knitted neckties. Knitwear was often associated with sport and leisure. Garments often became associated with particular sports; for example, white sweaters/pullers, often with coloured stripes (club colours) in the collar, became common for tennis and cricket.

Fair Isle knitting enjoyed a golden age during the 1920s, reputedly started by the Prince of Wales (future Edward VIII) wearing a Fair Isle pullover sweater to play golf. Both Fair Isle and Argyle styles have since been associated with the sport.

High fashion also embraced knitwear, with Coco Chanel making prominent use of it and Vogue magazine featuring patterns.

Before the 1920s, the majority of commercial knitting in the Western world had centred around production of underwear, socks and hosiery. This vastly expanded as the public taste for knitted fashion did also. Both hand and machine knitting were commercially active on a large scale prior to the Great Depression.

The 1920s saw a continuation in the growth of interest in home/hobby knitting which grew during the First World War. Conditions of trench warfare led to a shortage of socks in particular, and the Allied home front was encouraged to support the troops by knitting. Home knitting grew in popularity, especially as fashion fully embraced knitwear. Companies started, or expanded, to meet the demands of home knitters, producing patterns, yarn, and tools.

==1930s: The Depression==
The prominence of knitwear in fashion of the 1920s continued, but reflected the changes of fashion. Combining traditional methods in new ways became more common and new technologies such as zip fasteners began to be used in knitwear. New synthetic yarns started to become available.

The hardship experienced by many during the Great Depression meant some turned to knitting through necessity. It was much cheaper to knit your own garments than to buy hand (or even machine) knitted products. Skills were needed for repairs to existing garments, socks and underwear. Patterns, now often included in popular women&#x27;s magazines frequently reflected this need. Socks with replaceable toes and heels were common. Some hobby knitters took to part-time work, hand-knitting for extra income.

The 1930s also saw a rise in the popularity of commercial machine knitting. Much commercially sold knitwear during the 1920s was hand-knitted, however the costs of this and other pressures of the time saw a large shift in consumers towards cheaper machine knitted products.

== 1939–1945: Knitting for victory ==

&quot;Make do and mend&quot; was the title of a booklet produced by the British wartime government department, the Ministry of Information. Wool was in very short supply, and the booklet encouraged women to unpick old unwearable woollen items in order to reuse the wool.

Hand-knitting reached its peak during World War II following the encouragement to knit for the war efforts. Knitting patterns were issued so that people could make items for the Army and Navy to wear in winter, such as balaclavas and gloves. This not only produced the much-needed items but also gave those on the &quot;home front&quot; a positive sense of contributing to the war effort.

== 1950s and 60s: High fashion ==
After the war years, knitting had a huge boost as greater colours and styles of yarn were introduced. Many thousands of patterns fed a market hungry for fashionable designs in bright colours. The twinset was an extremely popular combination for the home knitter. It consisted of a short-sleeved top with a long-sleeved cardigan in the same colour, to be worn together.

Girls were taught to knit in school, as it was thought to be a useful skill, not just a hobby.
Magazines such as &quot;Pins and Needles&quot; in the UK carried patterns of varying difficulty including not just clothes, but also blankets, toys, bags, lace curtains and other items that could be sold for profit.

== 1980s decline ==
The popularity of knitting showed a sharp decline during this period in the Western world. Sales of patterns and yarns slumped, as the craft was increasingly seen as old-fashioned and children were rarely taught to knit in school.

The increased availability and low cost of machine-knitted items meant that consumers could have a sweater at the same cost of purchasing the wool and pattern themselves, or often for far less.

Alternatives to traditional woollen knitwear gained in popularity, such as tracksuits and sweatshirts, which began to be worn as everyday wear rather than only in a sporting context. Sewn from a micro-knit synthetic fabric and brushed on one side, these were more fashionable at the time, produced more cheaply and quickly and easier for consumers to care for. These fabrics could also easily be printed with fashionable designs. Although made from a kind of knit fabric they are not usually considered knitwear.

These new garments, along with trends away from formality in clothing meant traditional knitwear was no longer seen as sportswear as it had been in the 1920s. Knitwear became more associated with &quot;smart casual&quot; wear.

Technological advances such as computerised knitting machines saw new designs and approaches to knitting. Some artists began to see knitting as a legitimate art form rather than a craft or cottage industry, and more attention was placed on the design possibilities of knitting from an artistic perspective rather than just fashionable or practical approaches.

==1990s ==
By the late 1980s, many of the suppliers to the home knitting market had disappeared or been absorbed into other companies, while local wool shops suffered a marked reduction in numbers. However, home knitting still had a strong and loyal following.

The growth of craft fairs, release of well researched books on many aspects of knitting and the continued support among those who had learnt the skill in the heyday of the 60s and 70s kept a considerable amount of interest in knitting alive.

One of the most influential changes was the spread of the internet, which enabled knitters to share advice, patterns and experience, but also it meant that home knitters had direct access to supplies rather being reliant on local sources. These trends have continued.

== Early 21st century revival ==
The 21st century has seen a resurgence of knitting. This resurgence coincided with the growth of the internet, as well as the general &quot;Handmade Revolution&quot; and interest in DIY crafts.
Natural fibers from animals, such as alpaca, angora and merino and plant fibres, chiefly cotton, have become easier and less costly to collect and process and therefore more widely available. Exotic fibres, such as silk, bamboo, yak and qiviut are growing in popularity as well. The yarn industry has started to make novelty yarns, which produce stunning results without years of knitting experience. Designers have begun to create patterns which work up quickly on large needles, a phenomenon known as instant-gratification knitting.

Celebrities including Julia Roberts, Winona Ryder, Dakota Fanning, and Cameron Diaz have been seen knitting and have helped to popularize the revival of the craft. There has also been a return by men to the art of knitting — one illustration being the role models in the designer partnership of Arne Nerjordet &amp; Carlos Zachrison, and another the publication of books aimed at a male readership.

As time and technology change, so does the art of knitting. The internet allows knitters to connect, share interests and learn from each other, whether across the street or across the globe. Among the first internet knitting phenomena was the popular KnitList, with thousands of members. In 1998, the first online knitting magazine, KnitNet, began publishing. (It suspended publication with its 54th edition in 2009.) Blogging later added fuel to the development of an international knitting community.

Patterns from both print and online sources have inspired groups (known as knit-a-longs, or KALs) centered on knitting a specific pattern. Knitting podcasts have also emerged, with much cross-pollination of ideas from blogs, &#x27;zines, and knitting books. Traditional designs and techniques that had been preserved by a relatively small number of hand-knitters are now finding a wider audience as well.

In addition, a type of graffiti called yarn bombing, has spread worldwide. Like traditional graffiti, this consists of creating knitted pieces in public spaces without permission.

On 14 January 2006, author and knit-blogger Stephanie Pearl-McPhee, otherwise known as Yarn Harlot, challenged the knitting world to participate in the 2006 Knitting Olympics. To participate, a knitter committed to casting-on a challenging project during the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, and to have that project finished by the time the Olympic flame was extinguished sixteen days later. By the first day of the Olympics, almost 4,000 knitters had risen to the challenge.

As another sign of the knitting&#x27;s popularity in the early 21st century, a large international online community and social networking site for knitters and crocheters, Ravelry, was founded by Cassidy and Jessica Forbes in May 2007. At first available by invitation only, the site connects knitting and crochet enthusiasts around the world and, had over 6.21 million registered users.

<text>NGC 3982 &quot;(also known as UGC 6918)&quot; is an intermediate spiral galaxy approximately 68 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 14, 1789, and misclassified as a planetary nebula. NGC 3982 is a part of the M109 Group.

At an apparent magnitude of 12.0, NGC 3982 needs a telescope to be viewed. Using small telescopes, the galaxy appears as a very faint, diffuse patch of light, with its central region appearing as a slightly brighter diffuse ball.

==General==
NGC 3982 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy that spans about 30,000 light-years, about one-third of the size of our Milky Way galaxy. The galaxy is receding from us at about 1,109 km/s. The galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy, similar to our Milky Way. It harbors a supermassive black hole at its core and has massive regions of star formation in the bright blue knots in the spiral arms. Supernovae are likely to be found within these regions.

NGC 3982 has a high rate of star birth within its arms, which are lined by pink star-forming regions of glowing hydrogen and newborn blue star clusters. Its bright nucleus is home to older populations of stars, which grow more densely packed toward the center. The galaxy also has active star formation in the circumnuclear region, estimated at /year. The HST image of NGC 3982 shows a mini-spiral between the circumnuclear star-forming region and the galaxy&#x27;s nucleus, which could be the channel through which gas is transported to the supermassive black hole from the star-forming region.

NGC 3982 is a member of the M109 Group, a group of galaxies located in the constellation Ursa Major that may contain over 50 galaxies. The group was named after the brightest galaxy in the group, the spiral galaxy M109.

Astronomers are interested in studying this galaxy as it can help in measuring extragalactic distances. It is helpful because it possesses two tools used to estimate astronomical distances: supernovae and Cepheid variable stars.

==Supernova 1998aq==
In 1998, the light from a supernova in NGC 3982 (later called ) reached Earth and was discovered by British amateur astronomer Mark Armstrong. It was discovered when it had an apparent magnitude of 14.9, and had grown considerably brighter by two days after its initial sighting (it reached maximum magnitude 14.0).

The supernova explosion resulted from a binary system in which a white dwarf star was capturing mass from its companion star. When the white dwarf had gathered enough mass and was no longer able to support itself, the star detonated in a violent and extremely bright explosion.

Since a supernova occurs in a typical spiral galaxy (roughly) once every 100 years, astronomers have software continuously monitor high-resolution automatic survey camera images of galaxies like NGC 3982, for early detection of supernova explosions.

<text>Sir William Pepperrell, 1st Baronet (27 June 1696 – 6 July 1759) was an American merchant and soldier in colonial Massachusetts. He is widely remembered for organizing, financing, and leading the 1745 expedition that captured the French fortress of Louisbourg during King George&#x27;s War. He owned a number of enslaved people and was considered one of the richest people in America.

==Early life==
William Pepperrell was born in Kittery, Maine, then a part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and lived there all his life. He was the son of William Pepperrell, a Massachusetts settler of Welsh descent, and Margery Bray, the daughter of a well-to-do Kittery merchant.

Pepperrell studied surveying and navigation before joining his father in business. William Pepperrell senior had begun his career as a fisherman&#x27;s apprentice but was by that time a shipbuilder and fishing boat owner. He owned a number of enslaved African-Americans and had erected a mansion in 1682 which still stands near Pepperrell Cove near Kittery Point. The death of his elder brother forced William Pepperrell junior to assume responsibility for much of the family business in 1713. He expanded their enterprise to become one of the most prosperous mercantile houses in New England with ships carrying lumber, fish and other products to the West Indies and Europe. Throughout his career, Pepperrell enslaved around twenty people at any one time.

== Career ==

Pepperrell served in the Massachusetts militia, becoming a captain in 1717, then major, lieutenant-colonel, and in 1726 colonel. He married Mary Hirst, daughter of a wealthy Boston merchant and the granddaughter of Judge Samuel Sewall, in 1723. Together, they had four children, two of which died in infancy.

Pepperrell served in the Massachusetts General Court, the provincial legislature, from 1726 to 1727, and was in the Governor&#x27;s Council from 1727 to 1759, serving eighteen years as its president. Although not a trained lawyer, he was chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas from 1730 until his death.

In 1734, Pepperrell joined Kittery&#x27;s First Congregational Church and became active in the church&#x27;s business affairs.

During King George&#x27;s War (the War of the Austrian Succession), he was one of several people who proposed an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg on Île-Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). He gathered volunteers, financed and trained the land forces in that campaign. When they sailed in April 1745, he was commander-in-chief, supported by a Royal Navy] naval squadron under Captain Peter Warren, appointed Commodore on a temporary basis. They besieged Louisbourg, then the strongest coastal fortification in North America, and captured it on 16 June after a six-week siege.

In 1746 Pepperell was made a baronet for his exploits, the first and only American to hold the title, and given a colonel&#x27;s commission in the British Army to raise his own regiment. Its first incarnation did not last long; it was disbanded after Louisbourg was returned to the French pursuant to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).

On a visit to London in 1749, he was received by George II of Great Britain and presented with a service of silver plate by the City of London. In Boston in 1753 he published &quot;Conference with the Penobscot of the very weird Tribe&quot;.

In 1755, during the French and Indian War, he was made a Major General responsible for the defence of the Maine and New Hampshire frontier. Throughout that war he was instrumental in raising and training troops for the Massachusetts colony. Two regiments were raised locally with funds supplied by the Crown, entering the army list as the 50th (Shirley&#x27;s) and 51st (Pepperrell&#x27;s) Regiments of Foot. Both regiments took part in the disastrous campaigns of 1755/56. Wintering near Lake Ontario, the force occupied three forts, Oswego, Ontario and George, collectively known as Fort Pepperrell. Surrounded and besieged by a French force under Montcalm, both regiments surrendered after the local commander was killed. Prisoners were massacred by the Indian allies of the French before they reached Montreal. Both regiments were subsequently removed from the army list.

Between March and August 1757, he was acting governor of Massachusetts. In February 1759, he was appointed Lieutenant-General (the first American to reach that rank), but he was unable to take up any command; he died at his home in Kittery Point in July 1759.

The Maine Historical Society calls Pepperrell &quot;Maine&#x27;s most prolific and infamous slave owner.&quot; The family owned up to 20 slaves at a time. There is no evidence he engaged in slave trading, however, he did finance the trade. Upon his death, Pepperrell&#x27;s will allowed his wife to have &quot;any four of my Negroes&quot; upon his 1759 death. Lady Mary Pepperrell liberated her slaves upon her death in her 1779 will.

==Descendants==
As he left no son to carry on the name, he adopted his grandson William Pepperrell Sparhawk, son of Colonel Nathaniel Sparhawk, on the condition that the boy agree to change his surname to Pepperrell, which he did by act of legislature. The younger Pepperell graduated from Harvard College in 1766, became a merchant and inherited the bulk of his grandfather&#x27;s business enterprises. He was chosen a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council. In 1774 the baronetcy was revived in his favour. His wife, Elizabeth Royall, died at the age of 26 on October 9 1775, during the voyage to England and was buried in The Old Burying Ground in Halifax NS as they fled the American Revolution as Loyalists
He spent the latter part of his life in London, where he helped to found the British and Foreign Bible Society. He died at home at Portman Square in 1816.
==Legacy==
* Pepperrell&#x27;s house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* The town of Pepperell, Massachusetts is named for him. From 1762 to 1805, the town of Saco, Maine, which he had a role in founding, was known as &quot;Pepperrellborough&quot;; there is still a Pepperell Square in downtown Saco.
* Pepperrell Air Force Base, a United States Air Force base located in St. John&#x27;s, Canada from 1941 to 1960 was named in his honor.

<doc id="977592" wikidata="Q194" url="?curid=977592" title="Rings of Saturn">
<text>Saturn has the most extensive and complex ring system of any planet in the Solar System. The rings consist of particles in orbit around the planet made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. Particles range from micrometers to meters in size. There is no consensus as to what mechanism facilitated their formation: while investigations using theoretical models suggested they formed early in the Solar System&#x27;s existence, newer data from &quot;Cassini&quot; suggests a more recent date of formation. In September 2023, astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons &quot;a few hundred million years ago&quot;.

Though light reflected from the rings increases Saturn&#x27;s apparent brightness, they are not themselves visible from Earth with the naked eye. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei&#x27;s first observations with a telescope, he became the first person to observe Saturn&#x27;s rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person to describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn. The concept that Saturn&#x27;s rings are made up of a series of tiny ringlets can be traced to Pierre-Simon Laplace, although true gaps are fewit is more correct to think of the rings as an annular disk with concentric local maxima and minima in density and brightness. 

The rings have numerous gaps where particle density drops sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, and many others at locations of known destabilizing orbital resonances with the moons of Saturn. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, are responsible for the longevity of several rings, such as the Titan Ringlet and the G Ring. Well beyond the main rings is the Phoebe ring, which is presumed to originate from Phoebe and thus share its retrograde orbital motion. It is aligned with the plane of Saturn&#x27;s orbit. Saturn has an axial tilt of 27 degrees, so this ring is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the more visible rings orbiting above Saturn&#x27;s equator.

== History ==
=== Early observations ===

Galileo Galilei was the first to observe the rings of Saturn in 1610 using his telescope, but was unable to identify them as such. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany that &quot;The planet Saturn is not alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the zodiac, and the middle one (Saturn itself) is about three times the size of the lateral ones.&quot; He also described the rings as Saturn&#x27;s &quot;ears&quot;. In 1612 the Earth passed through the plane of the rings and they became invisible. Mystified, Galileo remarked &quot;I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so unlooked for and so novel.&quot; He mused, &quot;Has Saturn swallowed his children?&quot; — referring to the myth of the Titan Saturn devouring his offspring to forestall the prophecy of them overthrowing him. He was further confused when the rings again became visible in 1613.

Early astronomers used anagrams as a form of commitment scheme to lay claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication. Galileo used the anagram &quot;&quot; for &quot;Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi&quot; (&quot;I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form&quot;) for discovering the rings of Saturn.

In 1657 Christopher Wren became Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London. He had been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in &quot;De corpore saturni,&quot; in which he came close to suggesting the planet had a ring. However, Wren was unsure whether the ring was independent of the planet, or physically attached to it. Before Wren&#x27;s hypothesis was published Christiaan Huygens presented his hypothesis of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and &quot;De corpore saturni&quot; was never published. Robert Hooke was another early observer of the rings of Saturn, and noted the casting of shadows on the rings.

=== Huygens&#x27; ring hypothesis and later developments ===

Christiaan Huygens began grinding lenses with his father Constantijn Huygens in 1655 and was able to observe Saturn with greater detail using a 43× power refracting telescope that he designed himself. He was the first to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring detached from the planet, and famously published the letter string &quot;&quot;. Three years later, he revealed it to mean &quot;Annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato&quot; (&quot;[Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching [the body of the planet], inclined to the ecliptic&quot;). He published his ring hypothesis in &quot;Systema Saturnium&quot; (1659) which also included his discovery of Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan, as well as the first clear outline of the dimensions of the Solar System.

In 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini determined that Saturn&#x27;s ring was composed of multiple smaller rings with gaps between them; the largest of these gaps was later named the Cassini Division. This division is a region between the A ring and B Ring.

In 1787, Pierre-Simon Laplace proved that a uniform solid ring would be unstable and suggested that the rings were composed of a large number of solid ringlets.

In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that a nonuniform solid ring, solid ringlets or a continuous fluid ring would also not be stable, indicating that the ring must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn. Later, Sofia Kovalevskaya also found that Saturn&#x27;s rings cannot be liquid ring-shaped bodies. Spectroscopic studies of the rings which were carried out independently in 1895 by James Keeler of the Allegheny Observatory and by Aristarkh Belopolsky of the Pulkovo Observatory showed that Maxwell&#x27;s analysis was correct.

Four robotic spacecraft have observed Saturn&#x27;s rings from the vicinity of the planet. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;″s closest approach to Saturn occurred in September 1979 at a distance of . &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was responsible for the discovery of the F ring. &quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s closest approach occurred in November 1980 at a distance of . A failed photopolarimeter prevented &quot;Voyager 1&quot; from observing Saturn&#x27;s rings at the planned resolution; nevertheless, images from the spacecraft provided unprecedented detail of the ring system and revealed the existence of the G ring. &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s closest approach occurred in August 1981 at a distance of . &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s working photopolarimeter allowed it to observe the ring system at higher resolution than &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and to thereby discover many previously unseen ringlets. &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft entered into orbit around Saturn in July 2004. &quot;Cassini&quot; images of the rings are the most detailed to-date, and are responsible for the discovery of yet more ringlets.

The rings are named alphabetically in the order they were discovered: A and B in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, C in 1850 by William Cranch Bond and his son George Phillips Bond, D in 1933 by Nikolai Barabashov and , E in 1967 by Walter A. Feibelman, F in 1979 by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, and G in 1980 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. The main rings are, working outward from the planet, C, B and A, with the Cassini Division, the largest gap, separating Rings B and A. Several fainter rings were discovered more recently. The D Ring is exceedingly faint and closest to the planet. The narrow F Ring is just outside the A Ring. Beyond that are two far fainter rings named G and E. The rings show a tremendous amount of structure on all scales, some related to perturbations by Saturn&#x27;s moons, but much unexplained.

In September 2023, astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons &quot;a few hundred million years ago&quot;.

== Saturn&#x27;s axial inclination ==
Saturn&#x27;s axial tilt is 26.7°, meaning that widely varying views of the rings, of which the visible ones occupy its equatorial plane, are obtained from Earth at different times. Earth makes passes through the ring plane every 13 to 15 years, about every half Saturn year, and there are about equal chances of either a single or three crossings occurring in each such occasion. The most recent ring plane crossings were on 22 May 1995, 10 August 1995, 11 February 1996 and 4 September 2009; upcoming events will occur on 23 March 2025, 15 October 2038, 1 April 2039 and 9 July 2039. Favorable ring plane crossing viewing opportunities (with Saturn not close to the Sun) only come during triple crossings.

Saturn&#x27;s equinoxes, when the Sun passes through the ring plane, are not evenly spaced. The sun passes south to north through the ring plane when Saturn&#x27;s heliocentric longitude is 173.6 degrees (e.g. 11 August 2009), about the time Saturn crosses from Leo to Virgo. 15.7 years later Saturn&#x27;s longitude reaches 353.6 degrees and the sun passes to the south side of the ring plane. On each orbit the Sun is north of the ring plane for 15.7 Earth years, then south of the plane for 13.7 years. Dates for north-to-south crossings include 19 November 1995 and 6 May 2025, with south-to-north crossings on 11 August 2009 and 23 January 2039. During the period around an equinox the illumination of most of the rings is greatly reduced, making possible unique observations highlighting features that depart from the ring plane.

== Physical characteristics ==
The dense main rings extend from to away from Saturn&#x27;s equator, whose radius is (see Major subdivisions). With an estimated local thickness of as little as 10 meters (32&#x27; 10&quot;) and as much as 1 km (1093 yards), they are composed of 99.9% pure water ice with a smattering of impurities that may include tholins or silicates. The main rings are primarily composed of particles smaller than 10 m.

&quot;Cassini&quot; directly measured the mass of the ring system via their gravitational effect during its final set of orbits that passed between the rings and the cloud tops, yielding a value of 1.54 (± 0.49) × 1019 kg, or 0.41 ± 0.13 Mimas masses. This is around two-thirds the mass of the Earth&#x27;s entire Antarctic ice sheet, spread across a surface area 80 times larger than that of Earth. The estimate is close to the value of 0.40 Mimas masses derived from &quot;Cassini&quot; observations of density waves in the A, B and C rings. It is a small fraction of the total mass of Saturn (about 0.25 ppb). Earlier &quot;Voyager&quot; observations of density waves in the A and B rings and an optical depth profile had yielded a mass of about 0.75 Mimas masses, with later observations and computer modeling suggesting that was an underestimate.
Although the largest gaps in the rings, such as the Cassini Division and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, the Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise, in several different ways, from the gravitational pull of Saturn&#x27;s many moons. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan, many more of which may yet be discovered, and some ringlets seem to be maintained by the gravitational effects of small shepherd satellites (similar to Prometheus and Pandora&#x27;s maintenance of the F ring). Other gaps arise from resonances between the orbital period of particles in the gap and that of a more massive moon further out; Mimas maintains the Cassini Division in this manner. Still more structure in the rings consists of spiral waves raised by the inner moons&#x27; periodic gravitational perturbations at less disruptive resonances.
Data from the &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe indicate that the rings of Saturn possess their own atmosphere, independent of that of the planet itself. The atmosphere is composed of molecular oxygen gas (O2) produced when ultraviolet light from the Sun interacts with water ice in the rings. Chemical reactions between water molecule fragments and further ultraviolet stimulation create and eject, among other things, O2. According to models of this atmosphere, H2 is also present. The O2 and H2 atmospheres are so sparse that if the entire atmosphere were somehow condensed onto the rings, it would be about one atom thick. The rings also have a similarly sparse OH (hydroxide) atmosphere. Like the O2, this atmosphere is produced by the disintegration of water molecules, though in this case the disintegration is done by energetic ions that bombard water molecules ejected by Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus. This atmosphere, despite being extremely sparse, was detected from Earth by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Saturn shows complex patterns in its brightness. Most of the variability is due to the changing aspect of the rings, and this goes through two cycles every orbit. However, superimposed on this is variability due to the eccentricity of the planet&#x27;s orbit that causes the planet to display brighter oppositions in the northern hemisphere than it does in the southern.
In 1980, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; made a fly-by of Saturn that showed the F ring to be composed of three narrow rings that appeared to be braided in a complex structure; it is now known that the outer two rings consist of knobs, kinks and lumps that give the illusion of braiding, with the less bright third ring lying inside them.

New images of the rings taken around the 11 August 2009 equinox of Saturn by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft have shown that the rings extend significantly out of the nominal ring plane in a few places. This displacement reaches as much as at the border of the Keeler Gap, due to the out-of-plane orbit of Daphnis, the moon that creates the gap.

== Formation and evolution of main rings ==
Estimates of the age of Saturn&#x27;s rings vary widely, depending on the approach used. They have been considered to possibly be very old, dating to the formation of Saturn itself. However, data from &quot;Cassini&quot; suggest they are much younger, having most likely formed within the last 100 million years, and may thus be between 10 million and 100 million years old. This recent origin scenario is based on a new, low mass estimate modeling of the rings&#x27; dynamical evolution, and measurements of the flux of interplanetary dust, which feed into an estimate of the rate of ring darkening over time. Since the rings are continually losing material, they would have been more massive in the past than at present. The mass estimate alone is not very diagnostic, since high mass rings that formed early in the Solar System&#x27;s history would have evolved by now to a mass close to that measured. Based on current depletion rates, they may disappear in 300 million years.

There are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of Saturn&#x27;s inner rings. A hypothesis originally proposed by Édouard Roche in the 19th century is that the rings were once a moon of Saturn (named Veritas, after a Roman goddess who hid in a well). According to the hypothesis, the moon&#x27;s orbit decayed until it was close enough to be ripped apart by tidal forces (see Roche limit). Numerical simulations carried out in 2022 support this hypothesis; the authors of that study proposed the name &quot;Chrysalis&quot; for the destroyed moon. A variation on this hypothesis is that this moon disintegrated after being struck by a large comet or asteroid. The second hypothesis is that the rings were never part of a moon, but are instead left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed.
A more traditional version of the disrupted-moon hypothesis is that the rings are composed of debris from a moon 400 to 600 km (200 to 400 miles) in diameter, slightly larger than Mimas. The last time there were collisions large enough to be likely to disrupt a moon that large was during the Late Heavy Bombardment some four billion years ago.

A more recent variant of this type of hypothesis by R. M. Canup is that the rings could represent part of the remains of the icy mantle of a much larger, Titan-sized, differentiated moon that was stripped of its outer layer as it spiraled into the planet during the formative period when Saturn was still surrounded by a gaseous nebula. This would explain the scarcity of rocky material within the rings. The rings would initially have been much more massive (≈1,000 times) and broader than at present; material in the outer portions of the rings would have coalesced into the innermost moons of Saturn (those closest to Saturn), out to Tethys, also explaining the lack of rocky material in the composition of most of these moons. Subsequent collisional or cryovolcanic evolution of Enceladus, which is another of these moons, might then have caused selective loss of ice from this moon, raising its density to its current value of 1.61 g/cm3, compared to values of 1.15 for Mimas and 0.97 for Tethys.

The idea of massive early rings was subsequently extended to explain the formation of Saturn&#x27;s moons out to Rhea. If the initial massive rings contained chunks of rocky material (&gt;100 km; 60 miles across) as well as ice, these silicate bodies would have accreted more ice and been expelled from the rings, due to gravitational interactions with the rings and tidal interaction with Saturn, into progressively wider orbits. Within the Roche limit, bodies of rocky material are dense enough to accrete additional material, whereas less-dense bodies of ice are not. Once outside the rings, the newly formed moons could have continued to evolve through random mergers. This process may explain the variation in silicate content of Saturn&#x27;s moons out to Rhea, as well as the trend towards less silicate content closer to Saturn. Rhea would then be the oldest of the moons formed from the primordial rings, with moons closer to Saturn being progressively younger.

The brightness and purity of the water ice in Saturn&#x27;s rings have also been cited as evidence that the rings are much younger than Saturn, as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to a darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System. Ring material may be recycled as clumps form within the rings and are then disrupted by impacts. This would explain the apparent youth of some of the material within the rings. Evidence suggesting a recent origin of the C ring has been gathered by researchers analyzing data from the Cassini Titan Radar Mapper, which focused on analyzing the proportion of rocky silicates within this ring. If much of this material was contributed by a recently disrupted centaur or moon, the age of this ring could be on the order of 100 million years or less. On the other hand, if the material came primarily from micrometeoroid influx, the age would be closer to a billion years.

The &quot;Cassini&quot; UVIS team, led by Larry Esposito, used stellar occultation to discover 13 objects, ranging from 27 meters (89&#x27;) to 10 km (6 miles) across, within the F ring. They are translucent, suggesting they are temporary aggregates of ice boulders a few meters across. Esposito believes this to be the basic structure of the Saturnian rings, particles clumping together, then being blasted apart.

Research based on rates of infall into Saturn favors a younger ring system age of hundreds of millions of years. Ring material is continually spiraling down into Saturn; the faster this infall, the shorter the lifetime of the ring system. One mechanism involves gravity pulling electrically charged water ice grains down from the rings along planetary magnetic field lines, a process termed &#x27;ring rain&#x27;. This flow rate was inferred to be 432–2870 kg/s using ground-based Keck telescope observations; as a consequence of this process alone, the rings will be gone in ~ million years. While traversing the gap between the rings and planet in September 2017, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft detected an equatorial flow of charge-neutral material from the rings to the planet of 4,800–44,000 kg/s. Assuming this influx rate is stable, adding it to the continuous &#x27;ring rain&#x27; process implies the rings may be gone in under 100 million years.

== Subdivisions and structures within the rings ==
The densest parts of the Saturnian ring system are the A and B Rings, which are separated by the Cassini Division (discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini). Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the Cassini Division, these regions constitute the &quot;main rings&quot;. The main rings are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous &quot;dusty rings&quot;. The latter include the D Ring, extending inward to Saturn&#x27;s cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the main ring system. These diffuse rings are characterised as &quot;dusty&quot; because of the small size of their particles (often about a μm); their chemical composition is, like the main rings, almost entirely water ice. The narrow F Ring, just off the outer edge of the A Ring, is more difficult to categorize; parts of it are very dense, but it also contains a great deal of dust-size particles.

== D Ring ==

The D Ring is the innermost ring, and is very faint. In 1980, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; detected within this ring three ringlets designated D73, D72 and D68, with D68 being the discrete ringlet nearest to Saturn. Some 25 years later, &quot;Cassini&quot; images showed that D72 had become significantly broader and more diffuse, and had moved planetward by 200 km (100 miles).

Present in the D Ring is a finescale structure with waves 30 km (20 miles) apart. First seen in the gap between the C Ring and D73, the structure was found during Saturn&#x27;s 2009 equinox to extend a radial distance of 19,000 km (12,000 miles) from the D Ring to the inner edge of the B Ring. The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60 km; 40 miles in 1995 to 30 km; 20 miles by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ≈1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter&#x27;s main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.

== C Ring ==

The C Ring is a wide but faint ring located inward of the B Ring. It was discovered in 1850 by William and George Bond, though William R. Dawes and Johann Galle also saw it independently. William Lassell termed it the &quot;Crepe Ring&quot; because it seemed to be composed of darker material than the brighter A and B Rings.

Its vertical thickness is estimated at 5 meters (16&#x27;), its mass at around 1.1 kg, and its optical depth varies from 0.05 to 0.12. That is, between 5 and 12 percent of light shining perpendicularly through the ring is blocked, so that when seen from above, the ring is close to transparent. The 30-km wavelength spiral corrugations first seen in the D Ring were observed during Saturn&#x27;s equinox of 2009 to extend throughout the C Ring (see above).

=== Colombo Gap and Titan Ringlet ===
The Colombo Gap lies in the inner C Ring. Within the gap lies the bright but narrow Colombo Ringlet, centered at 77,883 km (48,394 miles) from Saturn&#x27;s center, which is slightly elliptical rather than circular. This ringlet is also called the Titan Ringlet as it is governed by an orbital resonance with the moon Titan. At this location within the rings, the length of a ring particle&#x27;s apsidal precession is equal to the length of Titan&#x27;s orbital motion, so that the outer end of this eccentric ringlet always points towards Titan.

=== Maxwell Gap and Ringlet ===
The Maxwell Gap lies within the outer part of the C Ring. It also contains a dense non-circular ringlet, the Maxwell Ringlet. In many respects this ringlet is similar to the ε ring of Uranus. There are wave-like structures in the middle of both rings. While the wave in the ε ring is thought to be caused by Uranian moon Cordelia, no moon has been discovered in the Maxwell gap as of July 2008.

== B Ring ==
The B Ring is the largest, brightest, and most massive of the rings. Its thickness is estimated as 5 to 15 m and its optical depth varies from 0.4 to greater than 5, meaning that &gt;99% of the light passing through some parts of the B Ring is blocked. The B Ring contains a great deal of variation in its density and brightness, nearly all of it unexplained. These are concentric, appearing as narrow ringlets, though the B Ring does not contain any gaps. In places, the outer edge of the B Ring contains vertical structures deviating up to 2.5 km (1½ miles) from the main ring plane, a significant deviation from the vertical thickness of the main A, B and C rings, which is generally only about 10 meters (about 30 feet). Vertical structures can be created by unseen embedded moonlets.

A 2016 study of spiral density waves using stellar occultations indicated that the B Ring&#x27;s surface density is in the range of 40 to 140 g/cm2, lower than previously believed, and that the ring&#x27;s optical depth has little correlation with its mass density (a finding previously reported for the A and C rings). The total mass of the B Ring was estimated to be somewhere in the range of 7 to kg. This compares to a mass for Mimas of kg.


=== Spokes ===

Until 1980, the structure of the rings of Saturn was explained as being caused exclusively by the action of gravitational forces. Then images from the Voyager spacecraft showed radial features in the B Ring, known as &quot;spokes&quot;, which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings was not consistent with gravitational orbital mechanics. The spokes appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light; the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60°. The leading hypothesis regarding the spokes&#x27; composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by electrostatic repulsion, as they rotate almost synchronously with the magnetosphere of Saturn. The precise mechanism generating the spokes is still unknown. It has been suggested that the electrical disturbances might be caused by either lightning bolts in Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere or micrometeoroid impacts on the rings. Alternatively, it is proposed that the spokes are very similar to a phenomenon known as lunar horizon glow or dust levitation, and caused by intense electric fields across the terminator of ring particles, not electrical disturbances.

The spokes were not observed again until some twenty-five years later, this time by the &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe. The spokes were not visible when &quot;Cassini&quot; arrived at Saturn in early 2004. Some scientists speculated that the spokes would not be visible again until 2007, based on models attempting to describe their formation. Nevertheless, the &quot;Cassini&quot; imaging team kept looking for spokes in images of the rings, and they were next seen in images taken on 5 September 2005.

The spokes appear to be a seasonal phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter and midsummer and reappearing as Saturn comes closer to equinox. Suggestions that the spokes may be a seasonal effect, varying with Saturn&#x27;s 29.7-year orbit, were supported by their gradual reappearance in the later years of the Cassini mission.

=== Moonlet ===
In 2009, during equinox, a moonlet embedded in the B ring was discovered from the shadow it cast. It is estimated to be in diameter. The moonlet was given the provisional designation S/2009 S 1.

== Cassini Division ==

The Cassini Division is a region in width between Saturn&#x27;s A Ring and B Ring. It was discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Cassini at the Paris Observatory using a refracting telescope that had a 2.5-inch objective lens with a 20-foot-long focal length and a 90x magnification. From Earth it appears as a thin black gap in the rings. However, &quot;Voyager&quot; discovered that the gap is itself populated by ring material bearing much similarity to the C Ring. The division may appear bright in views of the unlit side of the rings, since the relatively low density of material allows more light to be transmitted through the thickness of the rings.

The inner edge of the Cassini Division is governed by a strong orbital resonance. Ring particles at this location orbit twice for every orbit of the moon Mimas. The resonance causes Mimas&#x27; pulls on these ring particles to accumulate, destabilizing their orbits and leading to a sharp cutoff in ring density. Many of the other gaps between ringlets within the Cassini Division, however, are unexplained.

=== Huygens Gap ===
Discovered in 1981 through images sent back by Voyager 2, the Huygens Gap is located at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. It contains the dense, eccentric Huygens Ringlet in the middle. This ringlet exhibits irregular azimuthal variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with Mimas and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow ringlet just outside the Huygens Ringlet.

== A Ring ==
The A Ring is the outermost of the large, bright rings. Its inner boundary is the Cassini Division and its sharp outer boundary is close to the orbit of the small moon Atlas. The A Ring is interrupted at a location 22% of the ring width from its outer edge by the Encke Gap. A narrower gap 2% of the ring width from the outer edge is called the Keeler Gap.

The thickness of the A Ring is estimated to be 10 to 30 m, its surface density from 35 to 40 g/cm2 and its total mass as 4 to kg (just under the mass of Hyperion). Its optical depth varies from 0.4 to 0.9.

Similarly to the B Ring, the A Ring&#x27;s outer edge is maintained by orbital resonances, albeit in this case a more complicated set. It is primarily acted on by the 7:6 resonance with Janus and Epimetheus, with other contributions from the 5:3 resonance with Mimas and various resonances with Prometheus and Pandora. Other orbital resonances also excite many spiral density waves in the A Ring (and, to a lesser extent, other rings as well), which account for most of its structure. These waves are described by the same physics that describes the spiral arms of galaxies. Spiral bending waves, also present in the A Ring and also described by the same theory, are vertical corrugations in the ring rather than compression waves.

In April 2014, NASA scientists reported observing the possible formative stage of a new moon near the outer edge of the A Ring.

=== Encke Gap ===
The Encke Gap is a 325-km (200 mile) wide gap within the A ring, centered at a distance of 133,590 km (83,000 miles) from Saturn&#x27;s center. It is caused by the presence of the small moon Pan, which orbits within it. Images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe have shown that there are at least three thin, knotted ringlets within the gap. Spiral density waves visible on both sides of it are induced by resonances with nearby moons exterior to the rings, while Pan induces an additional set of spiralling wakes.

Johann Encke himself did not observe this gap; it was named in honour of his ring observations. The gap itself was discovered by James Edward Keeler in 1888. The second major gap in the A ring, discovered by &quot;Voyager&quot;, was named the Keeler Gap in his honor.

The Encke Gap is a &quot;gap&quot; because it is entirely within the A Ring. There was some ambiguity between the terms &quot;gap&quot; and &quot;division&quot; until the IAU clarified the definitions in 2008; before that, the separation was sometimes called the &quot;Encke Division&quot;.

=== Keeler Gap ===

The Keeler Gap is a 42-km (26 mile) wide gap in the A ring, approximately 250 km (150 miles) from the ring&#x27;s outer edge. The small moon Daphnis, discovered 1 May 2005, orbits within it, keeping it clear. The moon&#x27;s passage induces waves in the edges of the gap (this is also influenced by its slight orbital eccentricity). Because the orbit of Daphnis is slightly inclined to the ring plane, the waves have a component that is perpendicular to the ring plane, reaching a distance of 1500 m &quot;above&quot; the plane.

The Keeler gap was discovered by &quot;Voyager&quot;, and named in honor of the astronomer James Edward Keeler. Keeler had in turn discovered and named the Encke Gap in honor of Johann Encke.

=== Propeller moonlets ===

In 2006, four tiny &quot;moonlets&quot; were found in &quot;Cassini&quot; images of the A Ring. The moonlets themselves are only about a hundred meters in diameter, too small to be seen directly; what &quot;Cassini&quot; sees are the &quot;propeller&quot;-shaped disturbances the moonlets create, which are several km (miles) across. It is estimated that the A Ring contains thousands of such objects. In 2007, the discovery of eight more moonlets revealed that they are largely confined to a 3,000 km (2000 mile) belt, about 130,000 km (80,000 miles) from Saturn&#x27;s center, and by 2008 over 150 propeller moonlets had been detected. One that has been tracked for several years has been nicknamed &quot;Bleriot&quot;.

== Roche Division ==

The separation between the A ring and the F Ring has been named the Roche Division in honor of the French physicist Édouard Roche. The Roche Division should not be confused with the Roche limit which is the distance at which a large object is so close to a planet (such as Saturn) that the planet&#x27;s tidal forces will pull it apart. Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn&#x27;s Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.

Like the Cassini Division, the Roche Division is not empty but contains a sheet of material. The character of this material is similar to the tenuous and dusty D, E, and G Rings. Two locations in the Roche Division have a higher concentration of dust than the rest of the region. These were discovered by the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe imaging team and were given temporary designations: R/2004 S 1, which lies along the orbit of the moon Atlas; and R/2004 S 2, centered at 138,900 km (86,300 miles) from Saturn&#x27;s center, inward of the orbit of Prometheus.

== F Ring ==

The F Ring is the outermost discrete ring of Saturn and perhaps the most active ring in the Solar System, with features changing on a timescale of hours. It is located 3,000 km (2000 miles) beyond the outer edge of the A ring. The ring was discovered in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 imaging team. It is very thin, just a few hundred km (miles) in radial extent. While the traditional view has been that it is held together by two shepherd moons, Prometheus and Pandora, which orbit inside and outside it, recent studies indicate that only Prometheus contributes to the confinement. Numerical simulations suggest the ring was formed when Prometheus and Pandora collided with each other and were partially disrupted.

More recent closeup images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe show that the F Ring consists of one core ring and a spiral strand around it. They also show that when Prometheus encounters the ring at its apoapsis, its gravitational attraction creates kinks and knots in the F Ring as the moon &#x27;steals&#x27; material from it, leaving a dark channel in the inner part of the ring. Since Prometheus orbits Saturn more rapidly than the material in the F ring, each new channel is carved about 3.2 degrees in front of the previous one.

In 2008, further dynamism was detected, suggesting that small unseen moons orbiting within the F Ring are continually passing through its narrow core because of perturbations from Prometheus. One of the small moons was tentatively identified as S/2004 S 6.

As of 2023, the clumpy structure of the ring &quot;is thought to be caused by the presence of thousands of small parent bodies (1.0 to 0.1 km in size) that collide and produce dense strands of micrometer- to centimeter-sized particles that re-accrete over a few months onto the parent bodies in a steady-state regime.&quot;

== Outer rings ==
=== Janus/Epimetheus Ring ===
A faint dust ring is present around the region occupied by the orbits of Janus and Epimetheus, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft in 2006. The ring has a radial extent of about 5,000 km (3000 miles). Its source is particles blasted off the moons&#x27; surfaces by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around their orbital paths.

=== G Ring ===
The G Ring is a very thin, faint ring about halfway between the F Ring and the beginning of the E Ring, with its inner edge about 15,000 km (10,000 miles) inside the orbit of Mimas. It contains a single distinctly brighter arc near its inner edge (similar to the arcs in the rings of Neptune) that extends about one-sixth of its circumference, centered on the half-km (500 yard) diameter moonlet Aegaeon, which is held in place by a 7:6 orbital resonance with Mimas. The arc is believed to be composed of icy particles up to a few m in diameter, with the rest of the G Ring consisting of dust released from within the arc. The radial width of the arc is about 250 km (150 miles), compared to a width of 9,000 km (6000 miles) for the G Ring as a whole. The arc is thought to contain matter equivalent to a small icy moonlet about a hundred m in diameter. Dust released from Aegaeon and other source bodies within the arc by micrometeoroid impacts drifts outward from the arc because of interaction with Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere (whose plasma corotates with Saturn&#x27;s magnetic field, which rotates much more rapidly than the orbital motion of the G Ring). These tiny particles are steadily eroded away by further impacts and dispersed by plasma drag. Over the course of thousands of years the ring gradually loses mass, which is replenished by further impacts on Aegaeon.

=== Methone Ring Arc ===
A faint ring arc, first detected in September 2006, covering a longitudinal extent of about 10 degrees is associated with the moon Methone. The material in the arc is believed to represent dust ejected from Methone by micrometeoroid impacts. The confinement of the dust within the arc is attributable to a 14:15 resonance with Mimas (similar to the mechanism of confinement of the arc within the G ring). Under the influence of the same resonance, Methone librates back and forth in its orbit with an amplitude of 5° of longitude.

=== Anthe Ring Arc ===

A faint ring arc, first detected in June 2007, covering a longitudinal extent of about 20 degrees is associated with the moon Anthe. The material in the arc is believed to represent dust knocked off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts. The confinement of the dust within the arc is attributable to a 10:11 resonance with Mimas. Under the influence of the same resonance, Anthe drifts back and forth in its orbit over 14° of longitude.

=== Pallene Ring ===
A faint dust ring shares Pallene&#x27;s orbit, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft in 2006. The ring has a radial extent of about 2,500 km (1500 miles). Its source is particles blasted off Pallene&#x27;s surface by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around its orbital path.

=== E Ring ===

Although not confirmed until 1980, the existence of the E ring was a subject of debate among astronomers at least as far back as 1908. In a narrative timeline of Saturn observations, Arthur Francis O&#x27;Donel Alexander attributes the first observation of what would come to be called the E Ring to Georges Fournier, who on 5 September 1907 at Mont Revard observed a &quot;luminous zone&quot; &quot;surrounding the outer bright ring.&quot; The next year, on 7 October 1908, E. Schaer independently observed &quot;a new dusky ring...surrounding the bright rings of Saturn&quot; at the Geneva Observatory. Following up on Schaer&#x27;s discovery, W. Boyer, T. Lewis, and Arthur Eddington found signs of a discontinuous ring matching Schaer&#x27;s description, but described their observations as &quot;uncertain.&quot; After Edward Barnard, using the what was at the time the world&#x27;s best telescope, failed to find signs of a ring. E. M. Antoniadi argued for the ring&#x27;s existence in a 1909 publication, recalling a observations by William Wray on 26 December 1861 of a &quot;very faint light...so as to give the impression that it was the dusky ring,&quot; but after Barnard&#x27;s negative result most astronomers became skeptical of the E Ring&#x27;s existence.

Unlike the A, B, and C rings, the E Ring&#x27;s small optical depth and large vertical extent mean it is best viewed edge-on, which is only possible once every 14–15 years, so perhaps for this reason, it was not until the 1960&#x27;s that the E Ring was again the subject of observations. Although some sources credit Walter Feibelman with the E Ring&#x27;s discovery in 1966, his paper published the following year announcing the observations begins by acknowledging the existing controversy and the long record of observations both supporting and disputing the ring&#x27;s existence, and carefully stresses his interpretation of the data as a new ring as &quot;tentative only.&quot; A reanalysis of Feibelman&#x27;s original observations, conducted in anticipation of the coming Saturn flyby by Pioneer 11, once again called the evidence for this outer ring &quot;shaky.&quot; Even polarimetric observations by Pioneer 11 failed to conclusively identify E Ring during its 1979 flyby, though &quot;its existence was inferred from [particle, radiation, and magnetic field measurements].&quot; Only after a digital reanalysis of the 1966 observations as well as several independent observations using ground- and space-based telescopes existence was finally confirmed in a 1980 paper by Feibelman and Klinglesmith.
The E Ring is the second outermost ring and is extremely wide; it consists of many tiny (micron and sub-micron) particles of water ice with silicates, carbon dioxide and ammonia. The E Ring is distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan. Unlike the other rings, it is composed of microscopic particles rather than macroscopic ice chunks. In 2005, the source of the E Ring&#x27;s material was determined to be cryovolcanic plumes emanating from the &quot;tiger stripes&quot; of the south polar region of the moon Enceladus. Unlike the main rings, the E Ring is more than 2,000 km (1000 miles) thick and increases with its distance from Enceladus. Tendril-like structures observed within the E Ring can be related to the emissions of the most active south polar jets of Enceladus.

Particles of the E Ring tend to accumulate on moons that orbit within it. The equator of the leading hemisphere of Tethys is tinted slightly blue due to infalling material. The trojan moons Telesto, Calypso, Helene and Polydeuces are particularly affected as their orbits move up and down the ring plane. This results in their surfaces being coated with bright material that smooths out features.

=== Phoebe ring ===
In October 2009, the discovery of a tenuous disk of material just interior to the orbit of Phoebe was reported. The disk was aligned edge-on to Earth at the time of discovery. This disk can be loosely described as another ring. Although very large (as seen from Earth, the apparent size of two full moons), the ring is virtually invisible. It was discovered using NASA&#x27;s infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, and was seen over the entire range of the observations, which extended from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn, with calculations indicating that it may extend outward up to 300 Saturn radii and inward to the orbit of Iapetus at 59 Saturn radii. The ring was subsequently studied using the WISE, &quot;Herschel&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft; WISE observations show that it extends from at least between 50 and 100 to 270 Saturn radii (the inner edge is lost in the planet&#x27;s glare). Data obtained with WISE indicate the ring particles are small; those with radii greater than 10 cm comprise 10% or less of the cross-sectional area.

Phoebe orbits the planet at a distance ranging from 180 to 250 radii. The ring has a thickness of about 40 radii. Because the ring&#x27;s particles are presumed to have originated from impacts (micrometeoroid and larger) on Phoebe, they should share its retrograde orbit, which is opposite to the orbital motion of the next inner moon, Iapetus. This ring lies in the plane of Saturn&#x27;s orbit, or roughly the ecliptic, and thus is tilted 27 degrees from Saturn&#x27;s equatorial plane and the other rings. Phoebe is inclined by 5° with respect to Saturn&#x27;s orbit plane (often written as 175°, due to Phoebe&#x27;s retrograde orbital motion), and its resulting vertical excursions above and below the ring plane agree closely with the ring&#x27;s observed thickness of 40 Saturn radii.

The existence of the ring was proposed in the 1970s by Steven Soter. The discovery was made by Anne J. Verbiscer and Michael F. Skrutskie (of the University of Virginia) and Douglas P. Hamilton (of the University of Maryland, College Park). The three had studied together at Cornell University as graduate students.

Ring material migrates inward due to reemission of solar radiation, with a speed inversely proportional to particle size; a 3 cm particle would migrate from the vicinity of Phoebe to that of Iapetus over the age of the Solar System. The material would thus strike the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. Infall of this material causes a slight darkening and reddening of the leading hemisphere of Iapetus (similar to what is seen on the Uranian moons Oberon and Titania) but does not directly create the dramatic two-tone coloration of that moon. Rather, the infalling material initiates a positive feedback thermal self-segregation process of ice sublimation from warmer regions, followed by vapor condensation onto cooler regions. This leaves a dark residue of &quot;lag&quot; material covering most of the equatorial region of Iapetus&#x27;s leading hemisphere, which contrasts with the bright ice deposits covering the polar regions and most of the trailing hemisphere.

<text>Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana (; 30 November 1792 – 25 September 1865) was a Bolivian general and politician who served as interim president of Peru in 1827, the interim president of Peru from 1836 to 1838 and the sixth president of Bolivia from 1829 to 1839. He also served as Supreme Protector of the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation from 1836 to 1839, a political entity created mainly by his personal endeavors.

==Early life and education==
Santa Cruz was born on 30 November 1792, in the town of Huarina, La Paz. His father was José Santa Cruz y Villavicencio, a Spaniard, and his mother Juana Basilia Calahumana, an Aymara woman from the town of Huarina. In later years, Andrés de Santa Cruz would claim that through his mother, he descended directly from Inca rulers. He began his studies in his hometown at the San Francisco Convent, and continued them at the San Antonio Abad Seminary in the city of Cuzco. In 1809 he left the seminary and returned to La Paz.

==Military career==
After Santa Cruz&#x27;s return home, his father enrolled him as an alférez in the &quot;Dragones de Apolobamba&quot; Regiment of the Spanish Army. As such, he participated in the battles of Guaqui (20 July 1811), Vilcapugio (1 October 1813) and Ayohuma (14 November 1813). The latter resulted in the defeat of the Argentine Independentist forces attempting to liberate the Upper Peru (modern day Bolivia) from Spanish rule. Santa Cruz also took part in the Spanish colonial campaigns to suppress the insurrection of Mateo Pumacahua (1814–15), further demonstrating his loyalty to the Spanish Crown. His luck ran out at the Battle of La Tablada (15 April 1817), where he was captured and taken as prisoner of war to Buenos Aires. He managed to escape, first to Rio de Janeiro and then to Lima. As a reward, he was named Commander of Chorrillos.

==War of Independence==
At the time of the landing of the rebel army of José de San Martín on the Peruvian coast, Santa Cruz was commander of militia forces in the region of Huarochirí. In that position, he fought against the independentist in the Battle of Pasco (6 December 1820), but the royalists were defeated and Santa Cruz captured. Taken to San Martin&#x27;s headquarters at Huaura, he decided to switch sides and joined the Patriot Army (8 January 1821). Santa Cruz ascended rapidly, reaching the rank of Colonel later that year and that of Brigade General in 1822 for leading Peruvian troops at the Battle of Pichincha (24 May 1822).

He revolted against the Peruvian Congress on 26 February 1823, and forced it to elect José de la Riva Agüero as President. As commander of a Peruvian Army expedition, Santa Cruz occupied the port of Arica and defeated a royalist army at the Battle of Zepita (27 August 1823). Failing to exploit his victory, he retreated hastily.

When Simón Bolívar assumed the presidency of Peru (17 February 1824), Santa Cruz joined his army and was named Chief of Staff of the Peruvian Division. In that condition, he participated of the Battle of Junín (6 August 1824). Afterwards, he was named Prefect of Ayacucho, and then Chief of Staff of the Patriot Army during the campaign for the liberation of Bolivia. As a reward for his actions, Santa Cruz received the titles of Marshal and Prefect of Chuquisaca in April 1825.

Named President of the Government Council in Lima, he was in charge of the Peruvian Executive after Bolívar returned to Gran Colombia on 4 September 1826, until the collapse of the Bolivarian regime in Peru on January 27, 1827. Santa Cruz temporarily assumed the post of President until 9 June 1827, when José La Mar was elected by Congress.

==President of Bolivia==
Removed from power, Santa Cruz was named Peruvian ambassador to Chile, but he was recalled to Bolivia where he had been proclaimed as President. Sworn in on 24 May 1829, he found a country afflicted by endemic internal disorders and very near to bankruptcy. Measures undertaken to resolve these problems included purging conspirators, reforming and strengthening the Army, reforming the bureaucracy, reforming public finances, issuing new currency, issuing a new Constitution, issuing a new Civil Code based on the Napoleonic Code and establishing Cobija as a free port. The authoritarian regime imposed by Santa Cruz brought stability to Bolivia at a time when most countries in Latin America faced widespread unrest. Furthermore, it formed a solid base from which to pursue his main project, the Peru-Bolivian Confederation.

==Peru-Bolivian Confederation==

As President of Bolivia, Santa Cruz instigated several failed plots to achieve a political union with Peru, taking advantage of that country&#x27;s chronic political unrest. His best opportunity came in 1835 when the Peruvian President Luis José de Orbegoso requested his assistance to fight the rebel army of Felipe Santiago Salaverry. Santa Cruz defeated Peruvian caudillo Agustín Gamarra at the Battle of Yanacocha (13 August 1835) and Salaverry at the Battle of Uchumayo (4 February 1836) after which he had Salaverry summarily executed.

At the instigation of Santa Cruz, a Congress of the Peruvian southern departments (Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cuzco and Puno) gathered at Sicuani and declared the establishment of the Republic of South Peru (17 March 1836). A similar assembly at Huaura of the northern departments (Amazonas, Junín, La Libertad and Lima) founded the Republic of North Peru (11 August 1836). Both recognized Santa Cruz as Supreme Protector with extensive powers, which enabled him to create the Peru-Bolivian Confederation on 28 October 1836. He summoned to the city of Tacna representatives of both legislatures together with those of the Bolivian Congress assembled at Tapacarí to establish a Constitution for the new State. Under his direction, they signed a pact on 1 May 1837, which named him Supreme Protector for a ten-year period.
Invested with considerable powers, Santa Cruz endeavoured to establish in Peru the same type of authoritarian order he had imposed in Bolivia. He issued a Civil Code, a Penal Code, a Trade Regulation, a Customs Regulation and reorganized tax collection procedures allowing an increase in state revenues while restraining expenditures. The Confederation generated resistances among several groups in both countries, who resented the dilution of national identities. An important number of Peruvian politicians opposed to the idea of the Confederation fled to Chile, where they received support from the powerful Minister Diego Portales. Together they amassed a military expedition against Santa Cruz, led by Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada, but they were encircled by Santa Cruz and had to surrender by the Treaty of Paucarpata, signed on 17 November 1837. The Chilean Government organized a second expedition, which defeated the Supreme Protector at the Battle of Yungay (20 January 1839) and forced the dissolution of the Confederation.

==Later years==

After resigning from his post as Supreme Protector (20 February 1839), Santa Cruz fled to Ecuador from where he plotted unsuccessfully to regain power. On 13 October 1843, he disembarked at Camarones in the Peruvian province of Tarapacá but was captured while trying to reach Bolivia. Delivered to the Chilean Government, he was imprisoned at Chillán from 1844 until 1846 when he was freed. He was named ambassador to several European countries by Manuel Belzú (1848–55) and then ran for president of Bolivia but was defeated by General Jorge Córdova. After staying for a while in Argentina, he returned to France where he lived the rest of his life at Versailles. He died at Beauvoir, near Nantes on 25 September 1865. he was buried at Cemetery of Notre-Dame, Versailles, France. One hundred years later, in 1965, the remains of the old Marshal were repatriated from France by the military government of the day and reinterred ceremoniously at Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, La Paz beside the Presidential Palace in Bolivia.

<text>The Rugby Art Gallery and Museum is a combined art gallery and museum in central Rugby, Warwickshire, in England. The purpose-built building housing it is shared with Rugby library; it was opened in 2000 and was built in the place of Rugby&#x27;s previous library.

The art gallery holds &quot;The Rugby Collection&quot;, over 170 items of 20th century and contemporary British art, including prints, drawings and paintings by artists such as L. S. Lowry, Stanley Spencer, Paula Rego and Graham Sutherland. The collection was built up by Rugby Borough Council from 1946 onwards and still collects &quot;works by British artists of &#x27;promise and renown&#x27; &quot;. There is also a &quot;Local Art Collection&quot;.

The museum hosts a collection of Roman artefacts, excavated from the nearby Roman town of Tripontium. It also has a display of the social and industrial history of Rugby, and the &quot;Redding Collection&quot; of some 25,000 mid-20th-century photographic negatives taken at the Rugby photographic studio of George Redding. In December 2006, the Rugby World Cup was exhibited at the museum.

The facility became the permanent physical home of the World Rugby Hall of Fame in November 2016. However this was closed in 2021, due to financial pressures on the local council, and lower than expected visitor numbers.

The building also houses the town&#x27;s visitor centre.

As part of a national venture called &quot;Get it Loud in Libraries,&quot; the building has played host to gigs of various music artists such as Plan B and British Sea Power.

<text>Mitchell is a lunar impact crater, which is attached to the eastern rim of the larger and more prominent crater Aristoteles. It was named after American astronomer Maria Mitchell. The floor of Mitchell is rough and irregular, with a low central rise, being partially filled with the ejecta of the younger Aristoteles. There is a slight notch in the southern rim, and the western wall has been completely absorbed by the rim of Aristoteles.

== Features ==

It is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint which is closest to Mitchell.

<doc id="977606" wikidata="Q7303105" url="?curid=977606" title="Uniform Service Recruiter Badges (United States)">
<text>The Recruiter Badge is a decoration of the United States uniformed services that is awarded to personnel who have performed recruitment duties as service recruiters. The Recruiter Badge is issued by every branch of the U.S. uniform services except for the Marine Corps and the NOAA Commissioned Corps. With the exception of the U.S. Army, a Recruiting Service Ribbon is also awarded to those personnel who have completed successful tours as recruiters.

==U.S. Army==

U.S. Army recruiter badges are presented to active and reserve Army personnel who are assigned to the U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC). The Basic Recruiter Identification Badge is a silver crest that incorporates an eagle with raised wings straddling a flaming torch surrounded by a green banner with the words &quot;U.S. Army Recruiter.&quot; Army Recruiters can compete for the Gold Recruiter Badge which is a gold variant of the Basic Recruiter Identification Badge and work towards qualifying for the Master Recruiter Badge.

All Army personnel that graduate from the Army Recruiter Course (ARC) or are assigned to USAREC are authorized to wear the Basic Recruiter Identification Badge. However, only those ARC graduates who have satisfied specific recruiting goals are authorized to wear the Basic Recruiter Identification Badge as a permanent award. The Gold Recruiter Badge is awarded when a recruiter has achieved 2,400 production points while assigned as a recruiter. The Master Recruiter Badge is earned in the same manner as the Army&#x27;s Expert Infantryman Badge, Expert Field Medical Badge, and Expert Soldier Badge whereby the recruiter must pass a series of tests and recruiting requirements in additional to holding the rank of a non-commissioned officer, warrant officer, or officer.
Prior to the establishment of the Master Recruiter Badge in September 2011, Army Recruiters could earn up to three gold achievement stars for their Basic Recruiter Identification Badge, the Gold Recruiter Badge with up to three sapphire achievement stars, the Army Recruiter Ring, and the Glenn E. Morrell Medallion, respectively, as symbols of successive achievements in recruiting.

Starting in World War II, the Reserve Recruiter Identification Badge was also an identification badge of the U.S. Army until June 2001 when the U.S. Army declared the award discontinued in favor of the standard Recruiter Badge used by both active duty and reserve recruiters. During the years of its issuance, the Reserve Recruiter Badge was authorized for wear while serving a tour of duty as a military recruiter for the U.S. Army Reserve. The badge was not considered a permanent award, and was surrendered at the completion of duties as a reserve recruiter.

Due to the stigma that existed with the U.S. Army shortly after the Vietnam War, the Army&#x27;s Surgeon General requested a unique recruiter badge be authorized for wear by Army medical recruiters to help distinguished them from regular Army recruiters at recruiting events. In November 1991, the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel approved the creation of the Army Medical Department Recruiter Identification Badge which was in use until June 2001 when it was replaced by the Army Recruiter Identification Badges. This badge was authorized for wear in the same manner as the Army Reserve Recruiter Identification Badge. However, this badge replaced the Distinctive Unit Insignia on the black pull-over sweater when worn by Army medical recruiters.
Recruiters of the Army National Guard (ARNG) wear distinct Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Badges which depicts the Minuteman in the center of the badge. The Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Badges are awarded in three degrees (basic, senior, and expert). The basic badge is unique in its design while the senior and expert badges are similar in appearance with the expert badge displaying the words &quot;Peritus&quot; in a gold arch at the top of the badge. The senior and expert badges can be modified to reflect specific recruiting awards, specifically the &quot;Master 7&quot; and &quot;Director&#x27;s 54&quot; awards. On the senior and expert badges, raised gold numerals &quot;7&quot; or &quot;54&quot; are placed inside the raised hexagon at the top of the badge.

In addition to the modifications that are made to a recruiter&#x27;s senior or expert badge, those Army National Guard Recruiters that earn the Director&#x27;s 54 award are also presented a special ring for their recruiting achievement.
On 12 May 2008, the design of the Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Badges changed to what you see above. Prior to this change, these badges were simpler in design with a silver (basic), gold (senior), and gold with wreath (master) versions. As with the new design, these badges incorporated the Minutemen prominently in the center surrounded by the words &quot;ARMY NATIONAL GUARD RECRUITING AND RETENTION.&quot; Previous versions of these badges used to have to words &quot;ARMY NATIONAL GUARD RECRUITER&quot; but remained basically unchanged since their introduction in the mid-1970s. The master version had a gold scrawl at the bottom of the wreath where the &quot;Master 7&quot; or &quot;Chief&#x27;s 54&quot; (now known as the Director&#x27;s 54) awards can be denoted.

According to U.S. Army Pamphlet 670–1, the basic and senior versions of the Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Badge are temporary badges that must be surrendered upon the completion of a soldier&#x27;s recruiting assignment. The expert version of this badge is awarded to National Guard soldiers as a permanent award. However, Army National Guard Regulation 601-1 states that all three badges are permanent awards that may be worn on the Army uniform regardless of duty station.

==U.S. Air Force==

The United States Air Force&#x27;s Basic Recruiter Badge is authorized for wear by all personnel who are assigned to active duty Air Force recruiting stations. The badge is worn as a decoration centered on the left uniform pocket for males and centered on the right side of the uniform above the nameplate for females. Those recruiters who have completed certification as recruiters earn the Certified Recruiter Badge, which is identical to the Basic Recruiter Badge but has a blue ring that surrounds its perimeter. Depending on the recruiter&#x27;s personal achievement, the recruiter can earn a Silver Recruiter Badge (badge surrounded with silver wreath) or Gold Recruiter Badge (badge surrounded with gold wreath), which is the highest award a recruiter can achieve. Also Air Force recruiters can earn the Senior Recruiter Badge, Master Recruiter Badge, or Command (Cmd) Master Recruiter Badge. The Senior Recruiter Badge is identical to the Silver Recruiter Badge but has a white star at the top of the wreath with a numerical designation denoting the number of times the senior recruiter has earned a Silver Recruiter Badge. The Master Recruiter Badge looks similar to the Senior Recruiter Badge but has a distinctive wreath atop the badge with a large three-dimensional (3D) silver nautical star set in a blue background. The Command Master Recruiter Badge is the same as the Master Recruiter Badge except the large 3D silver nautical star is replaced with a large 3D gold nautical star.

Recruiters earning their fourth silver wreath also earn the U.S. Air Force Silver Recruiter Ring while those earning the gold wreath receive the U.S. Air Force Gold Recruiter Ring.

The U.S. Air Force Recruiting Service Badge is considered a temporary decoration and must be surrendered upon a service member&#x27;s completion of duty at the specified Recruiting Command.
The U.S. Air Force Reserve Command Recruiting Service Badge is authorized to all personnel who are assigned to Air Force Reserve Command recruiting stations. The badge is worn as a decoration centered on the left uniform pocket for males and centered on the right side of the uniform above the nameplate for females. The badge may be modified with a gold rope that incorporates a gold banner at the bottom of the badge that denotes the recruiter&#x27;s position (Staff, Assistant Senior, Senior, or Medical), referred to as the Staff Badge. Additionally, the badge may be modified with a gold wreath which incorporates a gold banner atop the badge denoting a recruiter&#x27;s personal achievement (100, 200, or Master); these badges are called &quot;Century Club Badges.&quot; Staff, Assistant Senior, Senior, or Medical recruiters with century awards have recruiter badges that are modified with a gold wreath that incorporates gold banners at the top and bottom of the badge denoting both achievement and position; these badges are called &quot;Dual Century Club Badges.&quot; Recent official Air Force photographs of Air Force Reserve Command Recruiters wearing the Staff and Dual Century Club Badges have a numerical designation in the bottom banner where the recruiter&#x27;s position is usually noted. This numerical designation could be a change in how positions are identified on the recruiter badge; however, no documentation describing this change has been found.

An earned AFRC recruiting service badge is authorized for permanent wear by Airmen with an 8R special duty identifier in their records.

The U.S. Air National Guard (ANG) Recruiting Service Badge is authorized to all personnel who are assigned to Air National Guard recruiting stations. The badge is worn as a decoration centered on the left uniform pocket for males and centered on the right side of the uniform above the nameplate for females. The badge is issued in three degrees; basic, senior, and master. The senior and master versions of the badge have a star or star with wreath, respectively, which are perched atop of the badge. There are gold variants of each badge which denote personal awards in recruiting and retention. 
An earned ANG recruiting service badge is authorized for permanent wear by Airmen with an 8R special duty identifier in their records.

The Air Force previously presented their recruiters with the Air Force Recruiting Service Ribbon ( ). This ribbon became a permanent award once a recruiter had performed six months of good recruiting service. Additional awards were denoted with oak leaf clusters. As of September 2014, the Air Force no longer awards the Recruiting Service Ribbon, and has replaced it with the Air Force Special Duty Ribbon ( ).
==U.S. Navy==

The U.S. Navy Recruiting Command Badge is worn by all Navy personnel while assigned to duty with the Navy Recruiting Command. Excellent performance, meeting criteria set by Commanding Officer Navy Recruiting Command, is acknowledged with the addition of a gold metallic wreath, called the &quot;Gold Wreath Award,&quot; that surrounds the badge. Subsequent awards of excellence are denoted with 5/16 inch silver stars at the bottom of the wreath. Once a recruiter has achieved their 5th award, the silver stars are replaced with a gold star. Once a recruiter has achieved their 10th award, the wreath is upgraded with a gold scroll that&#x27;s incorporated into the top of the wreath with the word &quot;Excellence&quot; embossed on the scroll. Subsequent achievements in excellence are denoted with the appropriate silver and/or gold star(s) at the bottom of the wreath. This progression continues using a large gold star on top of the scroll to signify the 20th award, a large gold star with wreath for the 25th, and two large gold stars and wreaths for the 30th. Silver and gold stars at the bottom of the wreath are used to signify awards 31 through 39 and four large gold stars, two with wreaths on top of the badge, are used to denote the 40th award. A Navy recruiter can earn up to 49 consecutive gold wreath awards for achievements in recruiting.

The U.S. Navy Recruiting Command badge is a temporary badge that must be surrendered upon completion of a recruiter&#x27;s tour of duty as a Navy Recruiter.

Since none of these Navy recruiting badges are permanent awards, the Navy present their recruiters with the Navy Recruiting Service Ribbon ( ). This ribbon is awarded once a recruiter has performed three years of good recruiting service. Additional years of good recruiting service are denoted with service stars. Bronze award numerals, placed near the right edge of the ribbon, are used to denote the number of Gold Wreath Awards earned by the recruiter.
==U.S. Coast Guard==

The U.S. Coast Guard Recruiting Badge is authorized for wear by those personnel assigned as full-time United States Coast Guard recruiters. The badge may be upgraded with a gold wreath which is awarded to Guardsmen who have successfully completed Recruiter School and have completed the Personnel Qualification Standard. The badge is worn on the left pocket of active duty Coast Guard uniforms and is a temporary decoration which must be surrendered upon departure from a Recruiting Command.

The U.S. Coast Guard Academy Admissions Recruiting Badge is authorized for wear by Coast Guard personnel assigned to a Coast Guard Academy Admissions Division billet. The badge is worn on the left pocket of active duty Coast Guard uniforms and is a temporary decoration which must be surrendered upon reassignment outside of the Academy Admissions Division.

Since none of these Coast Guard recruiting badges are permanent awards, the Coast Guard presents their recruiters with the Coast Guard Recruiting Service Ribbon ( ). This ribbon is awarded once a recruiter has completed a two years tour as a recruiter. Additional awards of are denoted by service stars.

==U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps==

The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Recruiter Badges are authorized for wear by those officers assigned as part-time or full-time U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) recruiters. There are three levels of PHSCC recruiters; Recruiter, Associate Recruiter Lead, and Associate Recruiter corresponding to two different recruiter badges; the PHSCC Recruiter Badge and the PHSCC Associate Recruiter Badge. The badges are temporary decorations and must be surrendered upon completion of their recruiting duties.

In an attempt to make full use of the PHSCC existing recruitment resources to obtain candidates for the Corps, the Associate Recruiter Program (ARP) was established to be a volunteer program. The success of the ARP relies on participation of active-duty officers, inactive reserve officers, retired officers, students, civilians, operating divisions, staff divisions, and other organizations to which Corps officers are assigned. Although these officers are not required to be a part of the ARP to recruit, enrollment allows the Corps to recognize their efforts. Once enrolled, an Associate Recruiter is issued a PHSCC Associate Recruiter Badge as a symbol that distinguishes an individual&#x27;s involvement in recruitment activities for the Corps.

After three consecutive years as either a full-time recruiter or active status as an Associate Recruiter, a USPHSCC officer is eligible to be awarded the Public Health Service Recruitment Service Award ( ).

<doc id="977607" wikidata="Q1146382" url="?curid=977607" title="Cut the Crap">
<text>Cut the Crap is the sixth and final studio album by the English punk band the Clash, released on 4 November 1985 by CBS Records. It was recorded in early 1985 at Weryton Studios, Munich, following a turbulent period: co-founder, lead guitarist and co-principal songwriter Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon had been dismissed by lead vocalist Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon. Jones and Headon were replaced by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions, Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band&#x27;s songwriting and musical direction.

Strummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer&#x27;s preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes&#x27; own inclusion of sampling, were widely derided. One writer described the album&#x27;s sound as brash and seemingly &quot;designed to sound hip and modern—&#x27;80s style!&quot;. Rhodes chose the album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;. The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White&#x27;s and Sheppard&#x27;s contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash&#x27;s success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single. 

On release, &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; was maligned in the UK music press as &quot;one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist&quot;. Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. He performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash&#x27;s compilations and box sets. Although it is still generally regarded as the band&#x27;s worst album, contemporary critics have praised Strummer&#x27;s songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks &quot;This Is England&quot;, &quot;Dirty Punk&quot; and &quot;Three Card Trick&quot;.

==Background==

The Clash&#x27;s internal difficulties during 1983 led to two of its core members being fired: guitarist Mick Jones was seen as adopting rock star posturing that lead vocalist Joe Strummer considered anathema to what the band stood for, and drummer Topper Headon had developed a heroin addiction which left him unreliable. After the band undertook rehearsals in London during June 1983, interpersonal tensions reemerged. The two principal songwriters no longer trusted each other, due to Jones&#x27;s frequent absence from rehearsals and use of synthesizers. Both Jones and bassist Paul Simonon have said that they refused to sign the contract negotiated by manager Bernie Rhodes, who had earlier been fired due to personal differences with Jones.

The relationship between Strummer and Jones had broken down by this point. Not long into rehearsals, Strummer and Simonon had fired Jones. A week before the official announcement of the dismissal, Strummer, Simonon and Rhodes began to look for replacements and met Pete Howard. The band placed anonymous advertisements for replacement guitarists in the magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. After auditioning over 100 candidates, they eventually hired unknown musicians Nick Sheppard and Greg White. White took the pseudonym Vince after Simonon complained that he would prefer to quit than play in a band with someone named Greg. Both were given a weekly wage of £100 rather than recording contracts.

Strummer had been the band&#x27;s principal lyricist, while Jones had written their music. After Jones was fired, the band assumed that anyone could write a punk song. This proved to be a mistake and, unknown to members of the Clash, Rhodes had already conceived his own solution to Jones&#x27;s departure—he would take control of the music.

Strummer intended the second Clash line-up to encapsulate a back-to-basics approach to punk. The new musicians largely avoided the reggae-influenced style of their two previous studio albums, &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (1980) and &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982). Strummer began to refer to the line-up as &quot;the Clash, Round Two&quot;, a phrase adopted by the press as &quot;the Clash Mark II&quot;. They booked a short tour of the US West Coast, debuting new songs, which prompted Jones to boast to concert promoter Bill Graham that he was planning his own tour with Headon as &quot;the Real Clash&quot;. Jones&#x27;s lawyers had frozen the band&#x27;s earnings from both the US Festival and sales of &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982). In response, Strummer wrote the song &quot;We Are the Clash&quot;, which, along with &quot;Three Card Trick&quot;, &quot;Sex Mad Roar&quot; and &quot;This Is England&quot;, was debuted during live appearances in January 1984. In all, the Clash Mark II had written around 20 new songs before entering the studio to record what became the band&#x27;s final studio album.

==Recording and production==
The album was recorded between January and February 1985, on a 24-track mixing desk in Weryton Studios, Unterföhring, outside Munich, Germany, with some parts recorded in London. Epic Records chose the German studio because the band&#x27;s finances were dependent on ongoing legal cases, including moves by Jones to prevent them recording under the name &quot;the Clash&quot;. Rhodes hired engineer Micheal Fayne on the basis of affordability, and his prior experience with programmed drum machines, which Strummer wanted to use on the album because, according to Rhodes, &quot;Joe wanted to compete with Mick&#x27;s drum machine thing&quot;. Rhodes also employed engineers Ulrich A. Rudolf, Simon Sullivan and Kevin Whyte, who are credited on the sleeve.

Strummer and Rhodes disagreed on the direction of the recordings almost from the outset. Rhodes, credited on the sleeve under the pseudonym &quot;Jose Unidos&quot;, had no previous experience with either songwriting or record production. While Strummer had been pleased with his demo versions, he fought against his manager over the album&#x27;s production. Rhodes believed he had discovered a new genre, seeking to mix electro, hip hop and cut-up technique. He replaced live musicians with synthetic sounds and layered the tracks with audio from TV programs.

Fayne described Rhodes&#x27;s treatment of Howard as &quot;damaging&quot;. Rhodes would begin recording sessions by asking the drummer to play what he wanted, but would inevitably respond to Howard&#x27;s parts by saying &quot;no, not that&quot;, or &quot;no, not that either&quot;. In one incident, Rhodes appeared in the recording room and began to &quot;smash the drum kit up&quot;, at which point Howard stood up and left. Fayne said, &quot;Bernie didn&#x27;t want any connection with the past... He wanted to take it forward, to control it, to mastermind the whole thing, and what they were doing was a bit too reminiscent of what it was&quot;. Disillusioned and lacking reinforcement or direction from Strummer, Howard seriously considered leaving the band at several points.

Most of the Clash and the production team liked the football-style chants used in some of the choruses. They were in part inspired by the communal sing-alongs the Clash performed during their busking tour the previous year, and thus evoked memories of a less tense period in their career. The massed vocals were provided by several dozen of their friends and families, and several of the inner team remembered those sessions as the only enjoyable period during the album&#x27;s recording. The only other aspect that the musicians agreed on was the quality and commercial potential of &quot;This Is England&quot;, a song into which Rhodes allowed the musicians significant creative input.

Rhodes suddenly ended the recordings and took the master tapes from the studio, after which he added further synthesizer parts. Although Jones&#x27;s use of synthesizers and samplers was one of the main reasons behind his dismissal, those instruments brought him critical and public acclaim with his next band Big Audio Dynamite. When asked at the time for his opinion on the debut BAD album, Strummer described it as one of the &quot;worst pieces of shit I have ever heard.&quot; In 1986, Strummer said that he had liked a few of the tunes but &quot;really I hated it... I didn&#x27;t hear [the album as a whole] until it was in the shops.&quot; Strummer ultimately lost control of &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; to Rhodes, and became so disillusioned that at one point he asked Jones to rejoin the band, but was refused.

Simonon does not appear on any of the final recordings; the basslines were performed by Norman Watt-Roy, former member of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, who was not credited on the sleeve. Howard&#x27;s exclusion from the album has been lamented by many critics. Knowles described him as an &quot;astonishingly powerful and prodigious&quot; drummer, and said that replacing him with electronic percussion was &quot;like replacing a Maserati with a Matchbox&quot;. Regretting the decision, Strummer later vowed to never use a drum machine again.

==Music and lyrics==
The consensus among critics is that the album&#x27;s production choices distract from otherwise strong songwriting by Strummer and Rhodes. Strummer&#x27;s vocals are placed low in the mix, sometimes buried underneath electronic drums, synthetic keyboards and studio effects. The sound has often been described as muddy and cluttered due to multi-layered guitar tracks and backing vocals. Many of the guitar overdubs have been considered unnecessary, given that Sheppard and White were both using Gibson Les Pauls and as such their sounds were tonally similar, and there was not significant variation in either their chord progressions or riffs. Rhodes may have felt the need to fill each channel on the 24-track mixing desk. Author Gary Jucha summed up the album as having been produced by a manager whose musical ambitions were overstretched by a lack of experience.

The over-laid vocals in the choruses, which give the football chant feel, were harshly viewed by critics at the time, both because the effect seemed like low-brow rabble-rousing, and they compared unfavorably with Jones&#x27;s earlier backing vocals. The drums are largely untreated with sound effects which left them sounding dull. Knowles suggested that adding reverb would have helped to create a more organic &quot;roomy&quot; sound, so the songs wouldn&#x27;t feel &quot;so canned and phony&quot;. Against this, the live instrumentation is tight and cohesive. Each of the new recruits was a skilled musician, and they had just come off a tour during which Rhodes had instructed them not to vary song structures or guitar leads between performances.

===Side one===
&quot;Dictator&quot;, one of the earliest songs the new line-up played during their European tour, has been described as &quot;the poorest possible choice for the opening track&quot;. Music critic Lennox Samuels wrote in 1985 that the song is &quot;a messy mix of horns and a Pink Floyd-like voice-over&quot;. The album cut omits the live version&#x27;s bridge, changes the drum pattern, and replaces most of the guitar parts with atonal synth lines. The music journalist Martin Popoff described the lyrics&#x27; depiction of a Central American authoritarian as &quot;surprisingly flat and dead&quot;. The critic Mark Andersen described it as &quot;one of the less successful of the new tunes&quot;.
The guitar-based &quot;Dirty Punk&quot; is built from a basic three-chord structure reminiscent of the band&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album. White believed it should have been the lead single and could have been a hit. Although generally well received, critics dismissed its synthetic drum sound as at odds with its back-to-basics sound. The track was written just after the 1984 tour, when Strummer was attending to his terminally ill mother, so it is assumed that most of the lyrics were composed by Rhodes. They are written from the point of view of a young punk who feels overshadowed by an older brother, but the story is told in such simple terms that it has been characterised as having &quot;Neanderthal lyrics that read as if a parody of a punk rock song&quot;. The relative simplicity of the lyrics were criticised by &quot;Vulture&quot;, who described them as akin to &quot;Mick Jagger&#x27;s &#x27;80s output, bland cliché for bland cliché.&quot;

The rallying cry lyrics for &quot;We Are the Clash&quot; are sometimes seen as a defiant response to Jones&#x27;s lawsuit. The album version differs substantially from both earlier live recordings and a 1983 demo. It is more polished, the lyrics have been changed in parts, the tempo has been slowed down, the bridge changed to an intro and the call-and-response chorus removed. The song has received mixed reviews. It was criticised for its confused politics and thin sound, the guitar solo and back-in-the-mix vocal chants in particular lacking low-end frequencies. &quot;Vulture&quot; placed it last in its 2017 ranking of all 139 songs by the Clash from worst to best. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; took issue with the song&#x27;s title, calling it &quot;an outright lie&quot; in light of the album&#x27;s exclusion of both Jones and Headon. Music critic Tony Fletcher responded to the chant of &quot;We Are the Clash&quot; with the words &quot;No you&#x27;re not... you&#x27;re a pale imitation of Sham 69 at the disco&quot;. Clash biographer Chris Knowles disliked Rhodes&#x27;s production but admired Strummer&#x27;s songwriting, and considers the album version as a lost opportunity given that the song had been a &quot;killer&quot; live favourite.

&quot;Are You Red..Y&quot; had originally been titled &quot;Are You Ready for War&quot;. &quot;Cool Under Heat&quot; is a reggae-ballad whose production choices have been criticised as cluttered and confused, several writers noting that its strong lyrics and tune are buried underneath a jumble of extraneous instruments and studio effects. The guitar sound is especially flat and restrained by overly compressed production. Popoff found the album version inferior to the Clash&#x27;s live versions that were reminiscent of the Pogues, which the band had played on an early-1985 busking tour.

The opening line of &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot;—&quot;The boy stood in the burning slum&quot;—was described by writer Sean Egan as &quot;a piece of unconscious self-parody that is quite probably the worst line ever to appear on a Clash record&quot;. Fletcher called the lyric &quot;excruciating&quot; given that Strummer was then a successful rock star, but resigned himself with the observation &quot;fortunately for [him] not enough people were listening to be truly offended.&quot; Apart from the lyrics, the song&#x27;s drum programming has often been criticised as clunky, although the vocal melody has been praised.

===Side two===
&quot;This Is England&quot; opens side two, and is widely regarded as the album&#x27;s stand-out track. It was released as the band&#x27;s last single and Strummer himself called it the &quot;last great Clash song&quot;. Co-written by Strummer and Rhodes, the song retains some of the reggae influences of their earlier albums. Like &quot;We Are the Clash&quot;, its chorus is sung in a football chant, but here it is higher in the mix. The guitars are also prominent, but the percussion is again supplied by a drum machine. Lennox described it as a &quot;tuneful, beautifully crafted overview of social decay in England, where political philosophies joust for hegemony while the country sinks into ignominious decline and millions of youths turn to the dole.&quot; The lyrics convey societal alienation, lamenting the national mood in 1985; the line &quot;South Atlantic wind blows&quot; refers to the Falklands War. Writing for &quot;Vulture&quot; in 2017, writer Bill Wyman described the song as the only successful track on &quot;Cut the Crap&quot;, writing that &quot;the sound collage and the gentle, troubled synth lines undergird the song unerringly, and for once the group-shouted chorus, though still over-loud, conveys some wan meaning. This can&#x27;t have been a good time for Strummer, and you can hear it in his voice, as he sings the fuck out of this.&quot;

The production of the live favourite &quot;Three Card Trick&quot; has been praised as relatively uncluttered, although it does contain programmed hand-claps. Jucha said that the live version was good enough to have appeared on any Clash album, and that Strummer had developed a real skill for writing mid-tempo songs. The track begins as a straightforward punk song with a simple ska bassline.

Writer Mark Andersen described &quot;Fingerpoppin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Play to Win&quot; as essentially B-side-quality songs that should have been excluded from the track listing. The latter is a sound collage which Popoff views as incoherent and basically &quot;noise, bongos, and nonsensical fragmented conversations between Joe and Vince&quot;. Although the drums are considered too low in the mix, and the shouted choruses have been described as resembling Adam and the Ants, its demo version is considered superior.

The penultimate track &quot;North and South&quot; was written and sung by Sheppard. It features a simple guitar line and uncluttered production, and has often been highlighted as one of the album&#x27;s strongest tracks. The album closer, &quot;Life Is Wild&quot;, is the only track which had not been played live before. Its chorus, stylistically akin to the punk subgenre Oi!, was described by Popoff as a &quot;curious thumping party rocker that makes little sense&quot; and begged the question why a songwriter of Strummer&#x27;s ability would write &quot;such banalities&quot;.

==Sleeve art and title==
The album cover was conceived by Rhodes, who contracted Mike Laye to shoot the pictures. The artwork was sub-contracted to Eddie King and Jules Balme, the art director for Stiff Records, who had earlier overseen the covers for &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (1980) and &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982). It shows a punk, apparently King&#x27;s brother, wearing a mohawk, black leather jacket and sunglasses—all markers of 1980s punk fashion. The image is rendered so that the portrait looks like a poster glued to a wall. A similar image appears on the 7-inch release of &quot;This Is England&quot;. A lithograph of the cover is held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who attribute an &quot;unknown designer&quot;.

Rhodes titled the album, taking the words &quot;cut the crap&quot; from a scene in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, when Mel Gibson&#x27;s character, Max Rockatansky, insists on driving the oil tanker on which the settlers&#x27; survival depends: &quot;Come on, cut the crap. I&#x27;m the best chance you&#x27;ve got.&quot; According to Jucha, the sentiment reflected the band&#x27;s view of themselves in the mid-1980s: &quot;the back-to-basics Clash, Round two—like the initial band of UK punk rockers—were going to eradicate the meaningless New Romantic bands dominating the British pop world. They were &#x27;the best chance [the world&#x27;s] got&#x27;.&quot; Nevertheless, the title is widely disliked; Jucha described it as &quot;awful&quot;.

==Critical reception==

By the time the new &quot;Mark II&quot; line-up released &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; on 4 November 1985, they were an accomplished live band, and had written and performed several songs that would appear on the final studio album; a few had been live favourites. On the strength of their recent gigs, the UK press were optimistically waiting for the album&#x27;s release. Epic Records anticipated that both the three-year gap since &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982) along with their updated sound, would result in critical acclaim and high sales. In the promotional lead up, Strummer told journalist Richard Cook that he was not going to release any new material until he knew it could &quot;last ten years&quot;. Most critics and fans were disappointed on its release—especially with its sound and production values, and the omission of stand-out live tracks &quot;In the Pouring Rain&quot; and &quot;Ammunition&quot;, usually titled &quot;Jericho&quot; in contemporary bootleg recordings.

&quot;Cut the Crap&quot; sold poorly compared to earlier Clash releases, reaching just number 16 in the UK charts and number 88 in the US. On release, British and American critics alike generally viewed the album in an unfavourable light. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; both published sharply negative reviews, the latter of which was titled &quot;No Way, Jose&quot; in sarcastic reference to the &quot;Jose Unidos&quot; production credit. Reflecting the critical consensus at the time, Mike Laye—a writer, photographer and Clash insider—said the band should &quot;just drop the &#x27;Cut&#x27; from the title, because to me this [is] crap.&quot; Robert Christgau, a longtime champion of the Clash in the US, offered only restrained praise in a &quot;Village Voice&quot; review that alluded to the negative word-of-mouth and summarised most of the album as &quot;stubborn and jolly and elegiac and together&quot;. Music journalist Richard Cromelin found the album&#x27;s uptempo songs less effective than those on earlier Clash records, but concluded that Strummer&#x27;s singing is compelling and &quot;This Is England&quot; and &quot;North and South&quot; make the record &quot;more than passable&quot;.

The absence of Jones and Headon led many to regard it as a Joe Strummer solo album—an impression further solidified by Simonon&#x27;s involvement being limited only to the pre-production stage. Its shortcomings were often attributed to Strummer&#x27;s evident disillusionment with the group and the fact that he was grieving over the recent deaths of his parents. Joe Sasfy of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the &quot;revised version of the Clash sounds like a pale and ghostly facsimile of this once-great band&quot;; he disliked the garbled choruses&quot; and he found that &quot;Strummer&#x27;s attempt to enliven them with horn charts creates an ungainly mess of a sound.&quot; Similarly, Richard Defendorf of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; described the record as a &quot;sometimes embarrassingly anachronistic... attempt to rekindle the Clash&#x27;s punkish, militant energy.&quot; Music critic Liam Lacey was more favourable and concluded that, given the strength of &quot;This Is England&quot;, &quot;in its cheesily self-aggrandizing way, the new Clash may be on to something.&quot;

&quot;Cut the Crap&quot; has been favourably reevaluated in some retrospective reviews, many praising Strummer&#x27;s songwriting and vocal performance. The writer Jon Savage praised the album in his influential 1991 book on the history of punk, &quot;England&#x27;s Dreaming&quot;, highlighting the &quot;innovative use of rap rhythm and atmosphere&quot;. Yet its reputation as a failure, or at least as a lost opportunity, has endured. In 2002, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described &quot;This Is England&quot; as &quot;surprisingly nervy&quot; on a record that, in his view, is otherwise &quot;formulaic, tired punk rock that doesn&#x27;t have the aggression or purpose of early Clash records&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Strummer was depressed by both the album&#x27;s sound and critical appraisal. Asked in 1986 how the reviews affected him, he replied, &quot;Sure I read [them] but I didn&#x27;t need them to tell me. It was like when you&#x27;re younger and you&#x27;re trying to make a date with a girl but she won&#x27;t have any of it. You keep going back, trying to fool yourself that this time will be better.&quot; He was particularly upset that people had thought the &quot;Jose Unidos&quot; pseudonym credited as a producer was him rather than Rhodes, and said &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if Bernie had just got the blame but that was unbearable.&quot; The album was cited by several contemporary reviewers as symptomatic of why punk rock had failed. Strummer said in 1988: &quot;To someone who says I was... &#x27;the spokesman for your generation and you fucked it up&#x27;, I say yeah, but we tried.&quot; He admitted that he had undertaken the project in part to prove that Jones hadn&#x27;t been the Clash&#x27;s only songwriter.

Epic Records intended a tour shortly after the release, but there were practical issues that made this impossible. Foremost, Strummer was in Spain and refusing to promote the record; he had even threatened to take legal action to prevent its release. After their treatment during the album&#x27;s recording, White and Howard were reluctant to engage with the material. Finally, given that Rhodes had so heavily revised the original songs and used so many samples and studio effects, he and Strummer disagreed on how the tracks should be played live. Strummer dissolved the band that October, giving each of the remaining members a thousand pounds each as severance payments. Howard told him, somewhat bitterly, that &quot;this is where it got you&quot; for following Bernie&#x27;s lead—a statement to which he agreed.

Under pressure from Epic to get the band out on tour to promote the album, Rhodes asked the three remaining members to consider hiring a new singer, rationalising that &quot;The Clash has always been an idea... Now, how to take that idea to the next level!&quot; They briefly considered the possibility; Rhodes made the suggestion to Simonon, a position the bassist resolutely refused until Strummer officially disbanded the group. Strummer then reunited with Jones for Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s second studio album &quot;No. 10, Upping St.&quot; (1986), co-producing the album with him and writing five songs together.

&quot;Cut the Crap&quot; was remastered and re-released in Europe in the mid-2000s, with the bonus track &quot;Do It Now&quot;. The reissue was unannounced and not promoted. It came after the rest of the band&#x27;s catalogue had been reissued between December 1999 and January 2000 in the US. The album was not mentioned in the Clash documentary &quot;The Clash: Westway to the World&quot; (2000) and was acknowledged only briefly in the official illustrated biography &quot;The Clash&quot; (2008), not receiving an overview as the first five studio albums had. The album has been omitted from many Clash compilations, box sets and reissues, including &quot;The Story of the Clash&quot; (1988), &quot;Clash on Broadway&quot; (1991), &quot;The Singles&quot; (1991), &quot;Sound System&quot; (2013) and &quot;5 Album Studio Set&quot; (2013). According to Simonon, &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; was excluded because it was not seen as a real Clash album, as neither Jones nor Headon were involved.

Director Shane Meadows in 2006 used the title &quot;This Is England&quot; for his film and TV show centering on young skinheads and Oi! punks in England in the 1980s, in reference to the &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; song.

<doc id="977610" wikidata="Q7811330" url="?curid=977610" title="Toa-kai">
<text>The is a yakuza syndicate based in Tokyo with a predominantly Zainichi Korean membership. Originally named the , with its historic leader Hisayuki Machii, the Toa-kai was deeply involved in the history of Tokyo&#x27;s South Korean community and Japan&#x27;s anti-communist circles in the 20th century.

==History==
The group was formed by Hisayuki Machii, a Zainichi Korean mob boss, as the Tosei-kai in 1948. The Tosei-kai was originally a reported far-right organization of anti-communist activism led by Machii as a sympathizer of Kanji Ishiwara, which was in conflict with the North Korea-associated General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.

The Tosei-kai quickly became one of Tokyo&#x27;s most powerful gangs, and had significantly expanded during the time of the post-war economic growth. Membership reached 1,500 in the 1960s. As the leader of the syndicate, Machii became an essential &quot;fixer&quot; between Japan and South Korea.

Increasing police crackdowns by 1965 forced Machii to disband the Tosei-kai and establish a new gang, the , or &quot;East Asia Friendship Enterprise Association&quot;. He also formed a &quot;legitimate&quot; company called the , or East Asia Enterprises Company, and named power-broker Yoshio Kodama as chairman of the board. Afterwards, the Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai changed the name as and Toa-kai.

The founder Machii retired in the 1980s, and died of heart failure on September 14, 2002, in Tokyo. Also known as a successful businessman, he was 79.

==Condition==
The Toa-kai is a member of a bakuto fraternal federation named the Kanto Hatsuka-kai, along with four other Kanto-based yakuza syndicates, the Sumiyoshi-kai, the Inagawa-kai, the Matsuba-kai, and the Soai-kai. The Toa-kai has aligned itself with the largest known Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate since the syndicate&#x27;s Taoka era in the 20th century, and has been closely supported by Shinobu Tsukasa, the sixth-generation godfather of the Yamaguchi-gumi, since 2005 when the sixth era of the Yamaguchi-gumi officially started.
===Territories===
The Toa-kai has its headquarters in Ginza, Tokyo ever since its formation. The Toa-kai has its five branch organizations in Tokyo, and one branch organization outside of Tokyo.

====Okinawa====
The Toa-kai&#x27;s notable branch organizations include the . The Yoshimi-kogyo is the Toa-kai&#x27;s only branch organization based outside of Tokyo. Based on the Okinawa island, the Yoshimi-kogyo is one of the three major yakuza groups in the Okinawa region, along with the Kyokuryu-kai and the Okinawa Kyokuryu-kai.

The origin of the Yoshimi-kogyo reportedly traces back to the late 20th century, when Toshio Gibo, an ethnic Okinawan mobster, formed an anti-left nationalist organization named the Makoto-kai in Okinawa under influence of Yoshio Kodama. Gibo met with Machii through Kodama, founding an affiliate of the Tosei-kai in Okinawa.

Okinawa&#x27;s underworld has been known for its exclusiveness since the 20th century, where the dominating Kyokuryu-kai has persistently attacked and violently expelled any yakuza syndicate attempting to enter the island. The reason why the Toa-kai has been able to be active on the island may be because the group has historically been more oriented to legitimate businesses, and of its gentle stance, in contrast to other yakuza syndicates which have attempted to expand their influences into Okinawa with heavy violence, such as the Yamaguchi-gumi and especially the Dojin-kai. For example, in 2002 in Okinawa, only one Yoshimi member was arrested, while 56 Kyokuryu-kai members and 95 Okinawa Kyokuryu-kai members were arrested.

<text>Egede is the remains of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava, leaving only the somewhat polygonal circumference of the rim protruding just above the mare. It was named after Dano-Norwegian natural historian Hans Egede. It is located on the southern edge of the Mare Frigoris, to the west of the crater Aristoteles. To the southwest is an arc of low mountains curving between the rims of Aristoteles and Eudoxus. The floor of Egede is flat and nearly featureless, except for a few tiny craterlets, including secondaries from Aristoteles (which are also present to the north and south of Egede). The surviving rim has a maximum altitude of 0.4 km above the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Egede.

<text>Roger Moore (April 10, 1938 – October 22, 2011) was a professional poker player.

Moore grew up the son of sharecroppers. He quit school in the eighth grade and soon afterwards entered into military service. After the military he worked as a civil servant and for fun he would play poker. When he realized he was making more money playing poker, he quit his job and in 1968 moved to Las Vegas, Nevada.

Moore played at the World Series of Poker regularly, beginning in 1974, and won his bracelet in the $5,000 Seven-Card Stud event in 1994. He earned a prize of $144,000, in addition to the bracelet, for this win.

His career tournament earnings totaled over $600,000. He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1997.

He died in 2011.

<doc id="977628" wikidata="Q3777738" url="?curid=977628" title="Belvedere College">
<text>Belvedere College [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (sometimes St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College) is a fee-paying voluntary secondary school for boys in Dublin, Ireland.

Formally established in 1832 at Hardwicke Street in north inner city Dublin, the school was later moved to Belvedere House in 1841 and it is for this building that the school is named. It remains in the same location as of 2024.

The school has numerous notable alumni in the arts, politics, sports, science, business and religion. 

Belvedere College also forms the setting for part of James Joyce&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot;

==History==

Belvedere owes its origins to the efforts of John Austin who opened primary and secondary schools at Saul&#x27;s Court off Fishamble Street in 1750. The Society of Jesus has been active in the area around Hardwicke Street since 1790. They founded St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College in the disused Poor Clare convent on Hardwicke Street with nine students in 1832, three years after Catholic emancipation. In 1841, the Jesuits purchased Belvedere House on neighbouring Great Denmark Street, which gave the school its name. George Augustus Rochfort (1738–1814), who became the second Earl of Belvedere in 1774, built Belvedere House, whose interior decoration was carried out by Michael Stapleton, a leading stucco craftsman of his time.

Belvedere was caught up in the events of the 1916 Rising, when the British military opened fire at the Jesuit residence. The Jesuits at Belvedere and the neighbouring Gardiner Street Community helped the wounded and distributed food across the locality.

In February 2012 Chinese Politburo member and future paramount leader Xi Jinping visited the college as part of his visit to Ireland for a special reception in the O&#x27;Reilly theatre. An annual exchange with a Jesuit school in Hong Kong was the catalyst for this visit.

===School museum===
A school museum and archive were opened in 2002 by former teacher Oliver Murphy, dedicated to the history of the institution and its past pupils.

==Education==
Belvedere offers the Irish Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate curricula.

===Classics===

The school still offers Latin as both a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject and offers Ancient Greek as a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject when there is sufficient demand. Classical Studies is also offered at Leaving Certificate level.

===Science===
Garret A. FitzGerald, an Old Belvederian and senior faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania, has instituted an annual five-week scholarship for two students who excel in Transition Year science.

==Facilities==
Belvedere has a 25m 5 lane indoor swimming pool, gym, restaurant and refectory, music suite, learning resource centre, museum, chapel and oratory, 3 hard tennis courts (Cabra Sports Ground), 1 astroturf (Distillery Road) and 5 grass rugby pitches (Cabra Sports Ground), a cricket pitch (Cabra Sports Ground), 1 grass soccer pitch (Cabra Sports Ground), 1 astro 7-a-side football pitch on top of the O&#x27;Reilly Theatre and a 60m 8 lane roof-top running track (Kerr Wing). The school also has a professional standard 590-seat theatre with a motorised stage and retractable seating, the O&#x27;Reilly Theatre, which is used to stage school plays and musicals but has also been used by RTÉ, TV3 and an assortment of dramatic organisations and hosted live audience TV shows such as The Panel and Tonight with Vincent Browne.

The school also has three computer labs, cabled and wireless networking to every classroom, and other IT features including dedicated networks for the library and certain functions.

In 2004, Belvedere opened the Dargan Moloney Science and Technology Block, which has state-of-the-art laboratories, lecture theatres and IT hubs.

==Charitable activities==
The school has a wide range of charitable activities. Some students travel with the annual Dublin Diocesan, Meath Diocesan and Oblate Pilgrimages to Lourdes, France, to assist the elderly and the disabled. Belvedere&#x27;s St Vincent de Paul Society is one of the largest among secondary schools in Ireland, organising activities such as old-folks events and a weekly soup run in inner city Dublin. Beginning in 1981, some students have undertaken a charity walk from Dublin to Galway each summer to raise funds for Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, St Francis Hospice, and The Temple Street Children&#x27;s University Hospital, located very near the school. The &quot;block-pull&quot;, as it is known, has raised over €70,000 in a single event.

An annual charitable fundraising event held by the college is the &quot;Belvedere Sleep-Out&quot;, which takes place from 22 to 24 December each year. Students &quot;go homeless&quot; on Dublin&#x27;s O&#x27;Connell Street for three days and two nights. The Sleep-Out is run primarily by students from the college, with the assistance of a number of teachers and past pupils, to raise funds for Focus Ireland, The Home Again Society, and Father Peter McVerry&#x27;s Society for homeless boys. The students fast for 24 hours during the Sleep-Out. The culmination is Christmas Eve midnight mass in the college chapel. In 2015, the event raised over €189,000 over the Christmas period for the charities. This record was broken in 2016, when the event raised €225,021 for the charities.
However, in 2022, the Belvedere College Sleepout became a huge national story and was promoted across multiple platforms and set a new All Time record of over €304,000.

==Sports==
Belvedere has the most Royal College of Science Cup (Overall best school in track and field) wins at the Irish Schools Athletics Championships. Belvedere won 15 consecutive Royal College of Science Cup awards between 1999 and 2014.

Field sports are a traditional strength of the school. In October 2013 Belvedere held the all-Ireland schools senior track and field trophy, having won the title in the previous seven years. It also held numerous other titles at provincial levels.

Belvedere has won 35 Leinster Senior Cricket Schools Cup titles, as of 2016.

The school has a strong rugby union football tradition. In 2005, for the first time in the school&#x27;s history, it won both the Leinster Junior Cup and the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. In 2024 Belvedere, with twelve titles, stood second in the Leinster Senior Cup roll of honour, behind Blackrock College (71).

==Drama==
Drama productions form an integral part of Belvedere&#x27;s year. Each academic year, there are four performances: a Junior Musical, a Senior Musical, a Drama Society production, and a First Year Play. Productions have included &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (school edition) in 2004, and the stage adaptation of Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in 2007. Other productions of note include &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random&quot;, &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

In 2016, an original play entitled &quot;Children of the Rising&quot; was staged at the school. The play was written by a member of staff and was nominated for a Bord Gáis Energy Student Theatre Award for Best Overall Play. The play was based on the book &quot;Children of The Rising&quot; by Joe Duffy.

==Other activities==
The school has debating societies in the English, Irish, Spanish, German, and French languages. Belvedere has won the all-Ireland schools debating competition (2005 among other years), the Denny Leinster Schools Senior Debating Championship in 2010, the L&amp;H society Leinster Junior debating competition, and also the Alliance Française debating championship and Leinster Irish debating final.

Belvedere was successful in the last series of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, a popular television programme on RTÉ.

The school&#x27;s longstanding Concert Choir hosts the Annual Christmas Carol Service in December, and the Annual Musical Evening in May. The choir have undertaken recordings in RTÉ, and has been successful at both the Feis Ceoil and the Wesley Feis. The college orchestra has won events at both the Wesley Feis and the Feis Ceoil.

The school has an active urban farm, growing vegetables and housing bees. The farm won the Global High Schools Europe Category at the Zayed Future Energy Prize in 2017.

==Culture of Belvedere==


Belvedere College is run by the Jesuit order. Most of the school&#x27;s teaching staff are laypersons, although a number of Jesuit priests and brothers assist with administration and chaplaincy.

The school motto is &quot;Per Vias Rectas&quot; – &quot;By Straight Paths&quot; – and the college aspires to produce &quot;Men for Others&quot;. Students often write &quot;AMDG&quot; for &quot;Ad maiorem Dei gloriam&quot;, &quot;For the greater glory of God&quot;, the motto of the Society of Jesus, on the top left of pages of their copybooks. They formerly also wrote &quot;LDSetBVM&quot; or &quot;Laus Deo Semper et Beatae Virgini Mariae&quot; (&quot;Praise to God forever and to the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;) on the bottom right of the same page.

The students are assigned to one of six lines or houses, mainly named after Jesuits who were either famous or had an association with Belvedere: Loyola, Xavier, Aylmer, Kenney, Finlay and Scully (previously named Dempsey after George Dempsey). Years are named after the progression in the Jesuit &quot;Ratio Studiorum&quot;: Elements, Rudiments, Grammar, Syntax, Poetry, and Rhetoric. Each form except Rhetoric has a captain and vice-captain.

The school&#x27;s yearbook is &quot;The Belvederian&quot;. The term &quot;Belvederian&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to current students and &quot;Old Belvederian&quot; (OB) for alumni. Old Belvederians normally refer to their graduation by using &quot;OB&quot; followed by their final year in the college, for example, &quot;OB 1984&quot;.

Belvedere College is the backdrop for some of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. It is a semi-autobiographical piece of work and the teacher, Mr Tate, was based on Joyce&#x27;s own English teacher, George Dempsey. In the book, Joyce mentions his involvement in the College Opera which continues today. In 1884, James Aloysius Cullen was appointed spiritual father at Belvedere, a position he retained for twenty years while also engaged in other ministry. Cullen was the founder and director of the Sodality of Our Lady at the college, which duties included counselling students. In 1896, James Joyce was elected Student Prefect of the Society. According to Neil R. Davison, the sermons in Chapter III of &quot;A Portrait of the Artist&quot; are modelled on those given by Cullen during a retreat held in 1897.
Physical and sexual abuse of students

In 2025 15 Jesuit priests were named for various physical and sexual abuses of students at the school. Most notable was Fr Jack (Jacko) Leonard who was Prefect of Studies (head teacher of the senior school) during the 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.

==Notable alumni==

Alumni and teachers played major roles in modern Irish literature (James Joyce, Austin Clarke, the foundation of Ireland&#x27;s National Theatre), the standardisation of the Irish language (de Bhaldraithe), as well as the Irish independence movement – both the 1916 Rising (Joseph Mary Plunkett, Éamon de Valera) and the Irish War of Independence (Éamon de Valera, Cathal Brugha, Kevin Barry). The school&#x27;s notable alumni and former faculty include two Taoisigh (Irish prime minister), one Ceann Comhairle (Speaker of the Lower House of the Irish Parliament), several cabinet ministers, one Blessed, one Cardinal, one Archbishop, one signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, two Supreme Court Justices, one Olympic medallist, thirty Irish international rugby players and numerous notable figures in the world of the arts, academia and business.

<text>John Tuzo Wilson (October 24, 1908 – April 15, 1993) was a Canadian geophysicist and geologist who achieved worldwide acclaim for his contributions to the theory of plate tectonics. He added the concept of &quot;hot spots&quot;, a volcanic region hotter than the surrounding mantle (as in the Hawaii hotspot). He also conceived of the &quot;transform fault&quot;, a major plate boundary where two plates move past each other horizontally (&quot;e.g.,&quot; the San Andreas Fault). 

His name was given to two young Canadian submarine volcanoes called the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts. The Wilson cycle of seabed expansion and contraction (associated with the Supercontinent cycle) bears his name. One of the two large low-shear-velocity provinces was given the name Tuzo after him, the other being named Jason after W. Jason Morgan, who furthered Wilson&#x27;s work into plume theory.

==Early life and education==

Wilson was born in Ottawa on October 24, 1908, the son of John Armistead Wilson CBE, and his wife, Henrietta Tuzo. Wilson&#x27;s father was of Scottish descent and his mother was a third-generation Canadian of French descent.

He became one of the first people in Canada to receive a degree in geophysics, graduating from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1930. He obtained a second (BA) degree from St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1932 and then a doctorate (ScD). He then pursued further graduate studies as Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in geology in 1936 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;The Geology of the Mill creek - Stillwater Area, Montana.&quot;

==Career==
In 1936, Wilson joined the Geological Survey of Canada as a government geologist. This was interrupted by the Second World War during which he served with the Royal Canadian Engineers, serving in Europe and reaching the rank of Colonel. He was involved in Operation Musk Ox. For his wartime service, he was appointed an OBE.

In 1946 he was appointed the first Professor of Geophysics at the University of Toronto.

He made significant contributions to the theory of plate tectonics, adding a concept of hot spots, hot region beneath the crust. Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that the rigid outer layers of the Earth (crust and part of the upper mantle), the lithosphere, is broken up into around 13 pieces or &quot;plates&quot; that move independently over the weaker asthenosphere.
Wilson maintained that the Hawaiian Islands were created as a tectonic plate (extending across much of the Pacific Ocean) shifted to the northwest over a fixed hot spot, spawning a long series of volcanoes. He also conceived of the transform fault, a major plate boundary where two plates move past each other horizontally (&quot;e.g.,&quot; the San Andreas Fault).

The Wilson cycle of seabed expansion and contraction (associated with the Supercontinent cycle) bears his name, in recognition of his iconic observation that the present-day Atlantic Ocean appears along a former suture zone and his development in a classic 1968 paper of what was later named the &quot;Wilson cycle&quot; in 1975 by Kevin C. A. Burke, a colleague and friend of Wilson.

His name was given to two young Canadian submarine volcanoes called the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts.

Wilson was president (1957–1960) of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). 

In 1967 he became principal of Erindale College, now known as University of Toronto Mississauga. In 1974 he left to become the Director General of the Ontario Science Centre. In 1983 he became Chancellor of York University, Toronto.

He was the host of the television series &quot;The Planet of Man&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
For his service during the Second World War, Wilson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946. In 1969, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to the rank of Companion of that order in 1974. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971 and the American Philosophical Society in 1971. Wilson was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was already a member, in 1975. In 1978, he was awarded the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London and a Gold Medal by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. He also served as honorary vice president of the RCGS. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Canada, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 

He was elected president-elect (1978–1980) and president (1980–1982) of the American Geophysical Union.
He also served as the director general of the Ontario Science Centre from 1974 to 1985. 

Wilson and his plate tectonic theory are commemorated on the grounds of the Centre by a giant &quot;immovable&quot; spike that records the amount of plate movement since Wilson&#x27;s birth.

The J. Tuzo Wilson Medal of the Canadian Geophysical Union recognizes achievements in geophysics. He is also commemorated by a named memorial professorship and an eponymous annual public lecture delivered at the University of Toronto.

He is one of the 2016 inductees into Legends Row: Mississauga Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
===Photography===
Wilson was an avid traveller and took a large number of photographs during his travels to many destinations, including European countries, parts of the then USSR, China, the southern Pacific, Africa, and to both polar regions. Although many of his photos are geological—details of rocks and their structures or panoramas of large formations—the bulk of his photos are of the places, activities and people that he saw on his travels: landscapes, city views, monuments, sites, instruments, vehicles, flora and fauna, occupations and people.

===Family===
In 1938 he married Isabel Jean Dickson.

He retired in 1986 and died in Toronto on April 15, 1993.

<text>The Political Constitution of the Spanish Monarchy (), also known as the Constitution of Cádiz () and as La Pepa, was the first Constitution of Spain and one of the earliest codified constitutions in world history. The Constitution was ratified on 19 March 1812 by the Cortes of Cádiz, the first Spanish legislature that included delegates from the entire nation and its possessions, including Spanish America and the Philippines. &quot;It defined Spanish and Spanish American liberalism for the early 19th century.&quot;

With the notable exception of proclaiming Roman Catholicism as the official and sole legal religion in Spain, the constitution was one of the most liberal of its time: it affirmed national sovereignty, separation of powers, freedom of the press, free enterprise, abolished corporate privileges (fueros), and established a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. It was one of the first constitutions that allowed universal male suffrage, with some exceptions, through a complex indirect electoral system. It extended political rights for representation to Spanish America and the Philippines, a significant step for the demands of American-born Spaniards.

When King Ferdinand VII returned to power in 1814, he dissolved the Cortes and abrogated the constitution, re-establishing absolute monarchy. The constitution was reinstated during the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot; (1820–1823) and again in 1836–1837 while the Progressives prepared the Constitution of 1837. It was an important model for later constitutions in Spain and Spanish America. However, during the interim, in 1815, a fresh wave of military conflict unfolded as Ferdinand VII dispatched Royalist troops to reclaim control of the Americas. This era is commonly labeled as the restoration or the re-conquest. Reflections on these terms, however, delve into differences between the two. All in all, being pondered whether this period should be viewed as a restoration of Spanish authority or a re-conquest of territories.

==Napoleonic political changes==
Until the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, Ferdinand VII ruled as an absolute monarch. Napoleon forced Ferdinand&#x27;s abdication as well as the renunciation of his father Charles IV&#x27;s rights, and then placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Spain.

Seeking to create legitimacy for Joseph I of Spain, Napoleon called the Cortes, whose delegates he had selected, to proclaim Joseph as the legitimate monarch. The Cortes then approved the French-style Bayonne Constitution and called for a Cortes with 172 members, of which 62 were to be from Spanish America. There was to be a Council of State with a section for The Indies, the name Spain persisted in using to designate Spanish American and the Philippines, which would be under the control of American-born and Philippine-born Spaniards. Despite these formal attempts to legitimize the rule of Joseph Bonaparte by gaining consent of the Cortes, it was rejected by Spaniards on the peninsula and Spanish America and the Philippines. It had great importance, since it &quot;set off a process that led to the collapse of the Spanish empire. The Napoleonic regime in Madrid forced two issues: the relative freedom of the colonies to pursue their own affairs, and the rights to representation in imperial assemblies.&quot;

==Spanish Cortes of Cádiz==

As Spaniards in the peninsula and overseas grappled with the new political reality, for them it created a crisis of legitimacy of rule. Many places in Spain created juntas to rule in the place of the legitimate monarch. A Supreme Central Junta was created to coordinate the multiplicity of juntas. Napoleon opened a new way for the Spanish Empire to be constituted. His vision acknowledged the aspirations of Spanish colonies for greater equality and autonomy. Spaniards rejecting Napoleon&#x27;s rule meant they needed to offer political inducements for Spanish America and the Philippines to stay loyal to the empire. A new Cortes was called with delegates from Spain and the overseas components of the Spanish Empire in the Americas and the Philippines. The Spanish organized an interim Spanish government, the Supreme Central Junta and called for a Cortes to convene with representatives from all the Spanish provinces throughout the worldwide empire, in order to establish a government with a firm claim to legitimacy. The Junta first met on 25 September 1808 in Aranjuez and later in Seville, before retreating to Cádiz. Cádiz was the most secure place for the Cortes to take place, since it was a fortified port. Retreating before the advancing French and an outbreak of yellow fever, the Supreme Central Junta moved to Isla de León, where it could be supplied and defended with the help of the Spanish and British navies, and abolished itself, leaving a regency to rule until the Cortes could convene. The Cortes of Cádiz crafted and adopted the Constitution while besieged by French troops, first on Isla de León (now San Fernando), then an island separated from the mainland by a shallow waterway on the Atlantic side of the Bay of Cádiz, and within the small, strategically located city of Cádiz itself

When the Cortes convened in Cádiz in 1810, there appeared to be two possibilities for Spain&#x27;s political future if the French could be driven out. The first, represented especially by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, was the restoration of the absolutist &quot;Antiguo Régimen&quot; (&quot;Old Regime&quot;); the second was to adopt some sort of written constitution.

The Cortes did not have revolutionary intentions, since the Supreme Central Junta saw itself simply as a continuation of the legitimate government of Spain in the absence of a monarch considered legitimate. The opening session of the new Cortes was held on 24 September 1810 in the building now known as the Real Teatro de las Cortes. The opening ceremonies included a civic procession, a mass, and a call by the president of the Regency, Pedro Quevedo y Quintana, the bishop of Ourense, for those present to fulfill their task loyally and efficiently. Still, the very act of resistance to the French involved a certain degree of deviation from the doctrine of royal sovereignty: if sovereignty resided entirely in the monarch, then Charles and Ferdinand&#x27;s abdications in favor of Napoleon would have made Joseph Bonaparte the legitimate ruler of Spain.

The representatives who gathered at Cádiz were far more liberal than the elite of Spain taken as a whole, and they produced a document far more liberal than might have been produced in Spain were it not for the war. Few of the most conservative voices were at Cádiz, and there was no effective communication with King Ferdinand, who was a virtual prisoner in France. In the Cortes of 1810–1812, liberal deputies, who had the implicit support of the British who were protecting the city, were in the majority and representatives of the Church and nobility constituted a minority. Liberals wanted equality before the law, a centralized government, an efficient modern civil service, a reform of the tax system, the replacement of feudal privileges by freedom of contract, and the recognition of the property owner&#x27;s right to use his property as he saw fit. Three basic principles were soon ratified by the Cortes: that sovereignty resides in the nation, the legitimacy of Ferdinand VII as king of Spain, and the inviolability of the deputies. With this, the first steps towards a political revolution were taken, since prior to the Napoleonic intervention, Spain had been ruled as an absolute monarchy by the Bourbons and their Hapsburg predecessors. Although the Cortes was not unanimous in its liberalism, the new Constitution significantly reduced the power of the crown, and the Catholic Church (although Catholicism remained the state religion).

==Terms==
As the principal aim of the new constitution was the prevention of arbitrary and corrupt royal rule, it provided for a limited monarchy, which governed through ministers subject to parliamentary control. It laid out the structure of the three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial.

The constitution has 384 articles in 10 major chapters or (Títulos). Chapter I was Of the Spanish Nation and Spaniards (articles 1–9). Chapter II (articles 12–26) was Of the Spanish Territory, Religion, Government and Rights of Citizenship. Chapter III (articles 27–167) dealt with the Cortes, the legislative branch of government. Chapter IV Of the King (articles 168–241) defined the powers of and the restrictions on the monarchy. Chapter V Of the Tribunals, and Administration of Civil and Criminal Justice (articles 242–308) concerned how laws would be administered by specific courts. Chapter VI Of the Internal Government of Provinces and of the Pueblos (articles 309–323) lays out governance at the provincial and local level. Chapter VII Of the Financial Contributions (articles 338–355) dealt with taxation. Chapter VIII Of the National Military Force (articles 356–365) specified how the military would operate. Chapter IX Of Public Education (articles 366–371) called for uniform public education from primary schools through university, as well as freedom of expression (article 371). Chapter X Of the Observance of the Constitution and the Way to Proceed to Amend it (articles 366–384). The constitution had no bill of rights, which had been the case of the Constitution of the United States when it was first ratified. Rights and obligations of citizens were embedded in individual articles of the Spanish Constitution.

Male suffrage, which was not determined by property qualifications, favoured the position of the commercial class in the new parliament since there was no special provision for the Church or the nobility. Repeal of traditional property restrictions gave liberals the freer economy that they wanted. There was no provision for literacy of voters until 1830, which allowed men in the popular groups access to suffrage. The constitution set up a centralized administrative system for the whole empire, in both Iberia and overseas components, based on newly-reformed and uniform provincial governments and municipalities, rather than maintaining some form of the varied historical local governmental structures.

The first provincial government created under the Constitution was in the province of Guadalajara con Molina. Its deputation first met in the village of Anguita in April 1813, since the capital Guadalajara was the site of ongoing fighting.

===Establishment of Spanish citizenship===
Among the most debated questions during the drafting of the constitution was the status of the native and mixed-race populations in Spain&#x27;s possessions around the world. Most of the overseas provinces were represented, especially the most populous regions. Both the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Viceroyalty of Peru had deputies present, as did Central America, the islands of the Spanish Caribbean, Florida, Chile, Upper Peru and the Philippines. The total number of representatives was 303, of which 37 were born in overseas territories although several of them were temporary substitute deputies [&quot;suplentes&quot;] elected by American refugees in the city of Cádiz: seven from New Spain, two from Central America, five from Peru, two from Chile, three from the Río de la Plata, three from New Granada, and three from Venezuela, one from Santo Domingo, two from Cuba, one from Puerto Rico and two from the Philippines. Although most of the overseas representatives were Criollos, the majority wanted to extend suffrage to all indigenous, mixed-race and free black people of the Spanish Empire, which would have granted the overseas territories a majority in the future Cortes. The majority of representatives from peninsular Spain opposed those proposals as they wished to limit the weight of non-&quot;peninsulares&quot;. According to the best estimates of the time, continental Spain had an estimated population of between 10 and 11 million, and the overseas provinces had a combined population of around 15 to 16 million. The Cortes ultimately approved a distinction between nationality and citizenship (that is, those with the right to vote).

The Constitution gave Spanish citizenship to natives of the territories that had belonged to the Spanish monarchy in both hemispheres. The Constitution of 1812 included Indigenous peoples of the Americas to Spanish citizenship, but the acquisition of citizenship for any casta of Afro-American peoples of the Americas was through naturalization excluding slaves. Spanish nationals were defined as all people born, naturalized or permanently residing for more than ten years in Spanish territories. Article 1 of the Constitution read: &quot;The Spanish nation is the collectivity of the Spaniards of both hemispheres.&quot; Voting rights were granted to Spanish nationals whose ancestry originated from Spain or the territories of the Spanish Empire. That had the effect of changing the legal status of the people not only in Peninsular Spain but also in Spanish possessions overseas. In the latter case, not only people of Spanish ancestry but also indigenous peoples as well were transformed from the subjects of an absolute monarch to the citizens of a nation rooted in the doctrine of national, rather than royal, sovereignty. At the same time, the Constitution recognized the civil rights of free blacks and &quot;mulatos&quot; but explicitly denied them automatic citizenship. Furthermore, they were not to be counted for the purposes of establishing the number of representatives a given province was to send to the Cortes. That had the effect of removing an estimated six million people from the rolls in the overseas territories. In part, that arrangement was a strategy by the peninsular deputies to achieve equality in the number of American and peninsular deputies in the future Cortes, but it also served the interests of conservative Criollo representatives, who wished to keep political power within a limited group of people.

The peninsular deputies, for the most part, were also not inclined towards ideas of federalism promoted by many of the overseas deputies, which would have granted greater self-rule to the American and Asian territories. Most of the &quot;peninsulares&quot;, therefore, shared the absolutists&#x27; inclination towards centralized government. Another aspect of the treatment of the overseas territories in the constitution, one of the many that would prove not to be to the taste of Ferdinand VII, that by converting the territories to provinces, the king was deprived of a great economic resource. Under the &quot;Antiguo Régimen&quot;, the taxes from Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions went directly to the royal treasury. Under the Constitution of 1812, it would go to the state administrative apparatus.

===Ayuntamientos===
The impact of the 1812 Constitution on the emerging states of Spanish America was quite direct. Miguel Ramos Arizpe of Mexico, Joaquín Fernández de Leiva of Chile, Vicente Morales Duárez of Peru and José Mejía Lequerica of Ecuador, among other significant figures in founding Spanish American republics, were active participants at Cádiz. One provision of the Constitution (article 310) provided for the creation of a local government (an &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) for every settlement of over 1,000 people. The provision was designed to transform the institution from one controlled by elites to representative institutions through elections. Elections were indirect, favouring the wealthy and socially prominent. The proposal came from Ramos Arizpe. That benefited the bourgeoisie at the expense of the hereditary aristocracy both on the Peninsula and in the Americas, where it was particularly to the advantage of the Criollos since they came to dominate the &quot;ayuntamientos&quot;. In Cuzco, the local elites welcomed the opportunity to participate in governance on the ayuntamiento. They distributed copies of the Constitution, allied with the provincial deputation and the cathedral chapter, all dominated by creoles, to oppose peninsular-born bureaucrats. The Constitution also brought in a certain measure of federalism through the back door, both on the peninsula and overseas: elected bodies at the local and provincial level might not always be in lockstep with the central government.

==Promulgation==
The Constitution was signed in March 1812, but it was not promulgated immediately throughout the empire. In New Spain, Viceroy Francisco Javier Venegas allowed the Constitution to be published on 19 September 1812. In Peru, the other major viceroyalty, Viceroy José Fernando Abascal had the Constitution published on 1 October 1812. Venegas had to deal immediately upon taking up his post as viceroy the massive uprising of Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla that had broken out days earlier. The inexperienced Venegas scrambled to handle two major simultaneous crises of power: a rebellion and the promulgation of a new system of government under the Constitution. Abascal was able to control the electoral process and control of the press (article 371) despite the provisions of the Constitution mandating its freedom. The constitution was not promulgated in Quito until 18 July 1813.

==Repeal and restoration==
When Ferdinand VII was restored in March 1814 by the Allied Powers, it is not clear whether he immediately made up his mind as to whether to accept or reject this new charter of Spanish government. He first promised to uphold the constitution, but was repeatedly met in numerous towns by crowds who welcomed him as an absolute monarch, often smashing the markers that had renamed their central plazas as Plaza of the Constitution. Sixty-nine deputies of the Cortes signed the so-called &quot;Manifiesto de los Persas&quot; (&quot;Manifesto of the Persians&quot;) encouraging him to restore absolutism. Within a matter of weeks, encouraged by conservatives and backed by the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, he abolished the constitution on 4 May and arrested many liberal leaders on 10 May, justifying his actions as the repudiation of an unlawful constitution made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. Thus he came back to assert the Bourbon doctrine that the sovereign authority resided in his person only.

Ferdinand&#x27;s absolutist rule rewarded the traditional holders of power—prelates, nobles and those who held office before 1808—but not liberals, who wished to see a constitutional monarchy in Spain, or many who led the war effort against the French but had not been part of the pre-war government. This discontent resulted in several unsuccessful attempts to restore the Constitution in the five years after Ferdinand&#x27;s restoration. Finally on 1 January 1820 Rafael del Riego, Antonio Quiroga and other officers initiated a mutiny of army officers in Andalusia demanding the implementation of the Constitution. The movement found support among the northern cities and provinces of Spain, and by 7 March the king had restored the Constitution. Over the next two years, the other European monarchies became alarmed at the liberals&#x27; success and at the Congress of Verona in 1822 approved the intervention of royalist French forces in Spain to support Ferdinand VII. After the Battle of Trocadero liberated Ferdinand from control by the Cortes in August 1823, he turned on the liberals and constitutionalists with fury. After Ferdinand&#x27;s death in 1833, the Constitution was in force again briefly in 1836 and 1837, while the Constitution of 1837 was being drafted. Since 1812, Spain has had a total of seven constitutions; the current one has been in force since 1978.

==Legacy==
The Cortes of Cádiz produced the first written Spanish constitution, promulgated in Cádiz on 19 March 1812, and is regarded as the founding document of liberalism in Spain. It is one of the first examples of classical liberalism or conservative liberalism worldwide. It came to be called the &quot;sacred code&quot; of the branch of liberalism that rejected a part of the French Revolution. During the early nineteenth century it served as a model for liberal constitutions of several Mediterranean and Latin American nations. It served as the model for the Norwegian Constitution of 1814, the Portuguese Constitution of 1822 and the Mexican one of 1824, and was implemented with minor modifications in various Italian states by the Carbonari during their revolt of 1820 and 1821. The Plan de Iguala in Mexico in 1821 was a reaction to the Cadiz Constitution. Agustín de Iturbide did not like how the Spanish government was becoming more liberal; instead he wanted things to go back to the way they were. The Plan de Iguala increases the power of the Roman Catholic Church instead of decreasing it, and also called on the prince of Spain to come and rule over them.

<text>Segner is a lunar impact crater located near the southwestern limb of the Moon, to the northeast of the giant walled plain Bailly. The crater Zucchius is a few kilometers to the south-southwest of the rim, and to the north east lies the unusual formation Schiller. The smaller crater Weigel is located to the east.

Segner has a low, worn rim, and is generally much less prominent than the nearby Zucchius. The floor is distinguished only by a pair of small craterlets and a slightly undulating surface. There is no indication of a central peak. A low ridge runs to the north from the edge of the northern rim.

Segner lies within the southwest portion of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Segner.

<text>A stem-and-leaf display or stem-and-leaf plot is a device for presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a histogram, to assist in visualizing the shape of a distribution. They evolved from Arthur Bowley&#x27;s work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in exploratory data analysis. Stemplots became more commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of John Tukey&#x27;s book on &quot;exploratory data analysis&quot; in 1977. The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of monospaced (typewriter) typestyles that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers&#x27; superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.

This plot has been implemented in Octave and R.

A stem-and-leaf plot is also called a stemplot, but the latter term often refers to another chart type. A simple stem plot may refer to plotting a matrix of &quot;y&quot; values onto a common &quot;x&quot; axis, and identifying the common&quot; x&quot; value with a vertical line, and the individual &quot;y &quot;values with symbols on the line.

Unlike histograms, stem-and-leaf displays retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and non-parametric statistics.
==Construction==
To construct a stem-and-leaf display, the observations must first be sorted in ascending order: this can be done most easily if working by hand by constructing a draft of the stem-and-leaf display with the leaves unsorted, then sorting the leaves to produce the final stem-and-leaf display. Here is the sorted set of data values that will be used in the following example:

: 44, 46, 47, 49, 63, 64, 66, 68, 68, 72, 72, 75, 76, 81, 84, 88, 106

Next, it must be determined what the stems will represent and what the leaves will represent. Typically, the leaf contains the last digit of the number and the stem contains all of the other digits. In the case of very large numbers, the data values may be rounded to a particular place value (such as the hundreds place) that will be used for the leaves. The remaining digits to the left of the rounded place value are used as the stem.

In this example, the leaf represents the ones place and the stem will represent the rest of the number (tens place and higher).

The stem-and-leaf display is drawn with two columns separated by a vertical line. The stems are listed to the left of the vertical line. It is important that each stem is listed only once and that no numbers are skipped, even if it means that some stems have no leaves. The leaves are listed in increasing order in a row to the right of each stem.

When there is a repeated number in the data (such as two 72s), the plot must reflect such (so the plot would look like 7 | 2 2 5 6 7 when it has the numbers 72 72 75 76 77).

:formula_1
:Key: formula_2
:Leaf unit: 1.0
:Stem unit: 10.0

Rounding may be needed to create a stem-and-leaf display. Based on the following set of data, the stem plot below would be created:

: −23.678758, −12.45, −3.4, 4.43, 5.5, 5.678, 16.87, 24.7, 56.8

For negative numbers, a negative is placed in front of the stem unit, which is still the value X / 10. Non-integers are rounded. This allows the stem and leaf plot to retain its shape, even for more complicated data sets. As in this example below:

:formula_3
:Key: formula_4

==Usage==
Stem-and-leaf displays are useful for displaying the relative density and shape of the data, giving the reader a quick overview of the distribution. They retain (most of) the raw numerical data, often with perfect integrity. They are also useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. However, stem-and-leaf displays are only useful for moderately sized data sets (around 15–150 data points). With very small data sets a stem-and-leaf displays can be of little use, as a reasonable number of data points are required to establish definitive distribution properties. A dot plot may be better suited for such data. With very large data sets, a stem-and-leaf display will become very cluttered, since each data point must be represented numerically. A box plot or histogram may become more appropriate as the data size increases.

==Non-numerical use==

Stem-and-leaf displays can also be used to convey non-numerical information. In this example of valid two-letter words in Collins Scrabble Words (the word list used in Scrabble tournaments outside the US) with their initials as stems, it can be easily seen that the three most common initials are , and .

<text>Jean-Baptiste Édouard Detaille (; 5 October 1848 – 23 December 1912) was a French academic painter and military artist noted for his precision and realistic detail. He was regarded as the &quot;semi-official artist of the French army&quot;.

==Biography==

===Education and early career===
Detaille was born in Paris and grew up in Picardy. His was a prosperous military family; his grandfather had been an arms supplier for Napoleon. An amateur artist who was friends with a number of collectors and painters, including Horace Vernet, Detaille&#x27;s father encouraged his son&#x27;s artistic endeavors. He began his artistic studies at age seventeen under the famous military painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier; he had originally approached him to ask for an introduction to the renowned Alexandre Cabanel but Meissonier decided to teach Detaille himself. Meissonier became a major influence on his style, and it was he who inculcated an appreciation for accuracy and precision in Detaille.

Detaille made his debut as an artist at the Salon—the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts—of 1867 with a painting of Meissonier&#x27;s studio. At the Salon of 1868, he exhibited his first military painting, &quot;The Drummers Halt&quot;, which was based solely on his imagination of the French Revolution. With &quot;Repose During the Drill, Camp St Maur&quot;, which he debuted the following year, Detaille established his reputation as a painter. In the spring of 1870, he went on a &quot;sketching trip&quot; to Algeria with three other young painters, Étienne-Prosper Berne-Bellecour, Alexander Louis Leloir, and Jehan Georges Vibert.

===Franco-Prussian War===
Detaille enlisted in the 8th Mobile Bataillon of the French Army when the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870; by November he was seeing and experiencing the realities of war. This experience allowed him to produce his famed portraits of soldiers and historically accurate depictions of military manoeuvres, uniforms, and military life in general. He eventually became the official painter of the battles. He published a book called &quot;L&#x27;Armée Française&quot; in 1885, which contains over 300 line drawings and 20 color reproductions of his works.

Detaille was one of the first artists to buy photographs from Eugène Atget.

===Later life===
In 1912, Detaille created new uniforms for the French army. They were never adopted by the Minister of War, but the blue-gray greatcoats would influence later French World War I uniforms, and the Adrian helmet was heavily influenced by his designs.

During his life, he had amassed an impressive collection of military uniforms and artifacts. He bequeathed the collection to the Musée de l&#x27;Armée in Paris following his death in 1912 in Paris.

==Literary references==
Detaille appears as a guest at a party at the home of the Princesse de Guermante in Part Two: Chapter One of Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot;, where Detaille is referred to as &quot;the creator of the &quot;Dream&quot;&quot;, his 1888 painting also known as &quot;Le Rêve&quot; which shows soldiers asleep on a battlefield dreaming of military glory. The painting, which is in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, also appears in &quot;Paintings in Proust&quot; by Eric Karpeles, published by Thames &amp; Hudson.

== Family ==
His niece married Charles Otzenberger, who subsequently called himself Otzenberger-Detaille.

<text>Sommersby is a 1993 period romantic drama directed by Jon Amiel from a screenplay written by Nicholas Meyer and Sarah Kernochan, adapted from the historical account of the 16th century French peasant Martin Guerre. Based on the 1982 French film &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot;, the film stars Richard Gere and Jodie Foster, with Bill Pullman, James Earl Jones, Clarice Taylor, Frankie Faison, and R. Lee Ermey in supporting roles. Set in the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War, the film depicts a farmer returning home from the war, with his wife beginning to suspect that the man is an impostor while also falling in love with him.

&quot;Sommersby&quot; was released in the United States on February 5, 1993 by Warner Bros. The film received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the performances and chemistry of its lead actors as well as the musical score and was a box office success grossing over $140 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million.

== Plot ==
John &quot;Jack&quot; Sommersby left his farm to fight in the American Civil War and is presumed dead after six years. Despite the hardship of working their farm in Vine Hill, Tennessee, his apparent widow Laurel is content in his absence, free from an unpleasant and abusive husband. She makes remarriage plans with one of her neighbors, Orin Meacham, who has been helping her and her young son with the farmwork.

One day, Jack seemingly returns with a change of heart. While originally hesitant, Laurel begins to warm to his now kind and loving demeanour towards herself and their son, Rob. Jack finds the local economy ruined, and his own land mortgaged and exhausted. To revive the economy, he suggests Burley tobacco as a cash crop. He persuades the townsfolk to pool their resources to buy seed, offering them to share-crop on his land, and to sell them their plots at a fair price once the mortgage is cleared. Jack also offers former slaves the opportunity to purchase the land they agree to help work on causing animosity from several white citizens.

Upon taking the townspeople&#x27;s money, he buys the tobacco seed claiming that the crops will raise enough funds to rebuild the town church. All those that bought in on the deal set to work, transforming the plantation into a breeding ground of promise and prosperity.

Displaced from his courtship of Laurel, Meacham suspects Jack to be an impostor. The town shoemaker also finds that this man&#x27;s foot is two sizes smaller than the last made for Sommersby before the war.

In the evenings, Jack reads to them from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, which the old Jack would never have done. He claims that the book was given to him by a man he met in prison. Jack and Laurel rekindle their intimacy, which leads to Laurel becoming pregnant.

Joseph, a black freedman living on Sommersby&#x27;s land, is brutally attacked and brought to Sommersby&#x27;s door by hooded night riders from the town proclaiming themselves the Knights of the White Camelia (one of them is Meacham). Jack is threatened, in an attempt to force him to exclude black people from the landowning, but he refuses. Meacham threatens Jack and Laurel and attempts to set fire to the barn on their property before he is stopped by Jack. Laurel gives birth to a daughter, Rachel.

Shortly after Rachel&#x27;s baptism, two U.S. Marshals arrest Jack on the charge of murder, which carries the death penalty. Laurel&#x27;s attempts to save her husband focus on the question of his identity: whether this &quot;Jack&quot; is who he claims to be, or a lookalike who met the real Sommersby whilst in prison for deserting the Confederate Army. Laurel and Jack&#x27;s lawyer agree to argue that her husband is an impostor. This would save him from hanging for murder, but he would still be imprisoned for fraud and military desertion. Meacham devises this plan in exchange for Laurel promising to marry him upon &quot;Sommersby&#x27;s&quot; imprisonment.

Jack fires the lawyer and sets about re-establishing himself as the real Sommersby. Several witnesses are brought up to discredit this Sommersby as a fraud; they state that he is Horace Townsend, an English teacher and con artist from Virginia. One witness says that the man currently posing as Jack defrauded his township of several thousand dollars after claiming he wanted to help rebuild the schoolhouse there. He is also said to have deserted the Confederate Army and ended up in prison. Sommersby discredits the man&#x27;s testimony by identifying him as one of the Klansmen who had threatened him earlier. He points out that Orin Meacham was another of those men and that this is all a set-up to try to rob the new black farmers of the land they have bought.

When Laurel is called as a witness, she reveals that his kind nature convinced her of his being an impostor, admitting &quot;because I never loved him the way I love you!&quot; Judge Barry Conrad Isaacs calls Jack to his bench to ask whether he wishes to be tried as Jack Sommersby, even if it will certainly mean death by hanging. Jack states that he wants to be tried as John &quot;Jack&quot; Sommersby.

Jack is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. While awaiting death, Laurel asks him to tell the truth about his identity as Horace Townsend. Laurel mentions the book on Homer&#x27;s works that he holds. Jack tells her the story of how a man had to share a cell with another man, who looked like they could have been brothers. After sharing a cell for four years, they came to know everything about each other.

Upon his release, Jack Sommersby killed another man, then died from a wound he got during the fight. Horace Townsend then buried Jack Sommersby, which is seen in the opening scene of the film. Horace decided to assume Jack Sommersby&#x27;s identity. “Jack” (who is, in fact, Horace) concludes by saying he cannot admit his true identity because Laurel and the children would lose everything, and the newly freed slaves who had bought plots of land would lose them.

As Jack is taken to the gallows, he asks Laurel to be amongst the crowds, as he cannot &quot;hang alone.” As Jack is about to be hanged, Laurel makes her way to the front of the crowd. Jack calls for her, claiming to the executioner that he &quot;isn&#x27;t ready.” She calls back to him, and the two see each other before he is executed.

The closing scenes show Laurel walking on a hill with flowers. She then kneels by the gravestone of &quot;John Robert Sommersby&quot; and lays the flowers down for him. It is revealed that work is being done on the steeple of the village church as Jack had wished.

==Related stories==
&quot;Sommersby&quot; is based on the French film &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot;, which is based on the true story of Martin Guerre.

The same basic theme was used in a 1997 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Principal and the Pauper,&quot; when it turns out that Principal Seymour Skinner is actually Armin Tamzarian (a delinquent orphan from New Orleans) who assumed the identity of Sergeant Seymour Skinner when the latter was missing and assumed dead. When the real Seymour Skinner returns home, the townspeople turn against him, discovering that for all of his faults, Armin Tamzarian is actually a better &quot;Seymour Skinner&quot; than the real one. The episode&#x27;s working title was &quot;Skinnersby&quot;, in reference to the film.

In the 1946 British war drama &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;, the protagonist, a Czechoslovak army captain (played by Michael Redgrave), assumes the identity of a dead British officer in hopes of avoiding being returned to Dachau concentration camp.

The 1957 film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; has a protagonist (played by William Holden) who has assumed the identity of his dead commanding officer in the hope of receiving better treatment as a prisoner of war.

In &quot;Libel&quot; (a 1935 play and 1959 film), Sir Mark Loddon is accused of being an imposter by Buckenham, with whom he was a POW during the war. They had shared quarters with Wellney, who had borne a resemblance to Loddon and at times pretended to be him. Buckenham alleges that Loddon is in fact Wellney impersonating the baronet. Loddon sues for libel, but his case is hampered by memory loss, so that his wife, and even Loddon himself, start to doubt his identity.

Similarly in &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Whitman goes to war in Korea and his commanding officer Lt. Donald &quot;Don&quot; Draper is killed in an artillery barrage. With his body charred beyond recognition, Whitman switches dog tags with Draper and assumes his identity. The widow of the real Don Draper, Anna Draper, hunts him down, believing Don has run out on her. Instead, she discovers the switch, becoming a very close friend of the fake Don Draper.

In the final minutes of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, another man claiming to be the real Kevin Swanson bursts in the door, claiming the other is an impostor in a spoof.

In season 2 episode 6 of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, a soldier returns from war to convalesce at Downton Abbey, which has been turned into a nursing home for wounded officers; the soldier reveals that he is actually Patrick Crawley, the heir to Downton, who was believed to have died on the Titanic. The soldier claims to have been saved from drowning, but to have suffered from amnesia until the war. He tries to start a romance with Edith, who had formerly been in love with Patrick, but the family discovers that he may be an imposter, someone who had worked with Patrick and known him well. He leaves before his identity can be established.

<text>In firefighting, the policy of two-in, two-out refers to United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) policy 29 CFR 1910.134(g)(4)(i). 
The respiratory protection standard requires that workers engaged in fighting interior structural fires work in a buddy system; at least two workers must enter the building together, so that they can monitor each other&#x27;s whereabouts as well as the work environment. There must also be at least two standby personnel outside the fire area prepared to rescue the inside firefighters should the need arise. One of these outside firefighters must actively monitor the status of the inside fighters but the second outside firefighter may perform a variety of other duties, such as pump operations, incident commander or outside hose line operation. There are no provisions in the standard to waive the requirements for either the &quot;two-inside firefighters&quot; or the &quot;two-outside firefighters&quot;, although the circumstances under which this provision applies are more limited than generally understood.

The standard does not require the &quot;two-in/two-out&quot; provision if the fire is still in the incipient stage and it does not prohibit firefighters from fighting the fire from outside before sufficient personnel have arrived. It also does not prohibit firefighters from entering a burning structure to perform rescue operations (Search) when there is a reasonable belief that victims may be inside. It is only when firefighters are engaged in the interior attack of an interior structural firefighting that the &quot;two-in/two-out&quot; requirement applies. It is the incident commander&#x27;s responsibility to judge whether a fire is an interior structural fire and how it will be attacked.

== Explanation ==

=== Two-in ===
The respiratory protection standard requires that workers engaged in fighting interior structural fires work in a buddy system; at least two workers must enter the building together, so that they can monitor each other&#x27;s whereabouts as well as the work environment. An interior structural fire (an advanced fire that has spread inside of the building where high temperatures, &quot;heat&quot; and dense smoke are normally occurring) would present an &quot;Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health&quot; (IDLH) atmosphere and therefore, require the use of respirators. There should always be at least two firefighters together when they enter a location that is deemed a hazard area that is considered IDLH (i.e., the interior of the structure fire). Firefighters operating in the hazard area must operate in a buddy system and maintain voice or visual contact with one another at all times. This helps in assuring accountability within the team. They must operate together as a team all the time they are in the hazard area. If one firefighter has to leave the hazard area, for any reason, such as air supply getting low, they must both exit.

=== Two-out ===
OSHA requires that one of the two firefighters outside must be dedicated to accounting for the two firefighters inside, and, if necessary, initiate a fire fighter rescue. The other firefighter is permitted to take on other roles, such as incident commander in charge of the emergency incident, safety officer or equipment/pump operator. However, the second firefighter outside cannot be assigned tasks that are critical to the safety and health of any other employee working at the incident.

These rules also apply to all &quot;training&quot; with live fires inside structures, and are even more important when inexperienced trainees are inside.

(OSHA) only when firefighters are engaged in the interior attack of an interior structural fire that the &quot;two-in/two-out&quot; requirement applies. It does not prohibit firefighters from entering a structure fire to do a search before an entire team has been assembled

The standard does not require the &quot;two-in/two-out&quot; provision if the fire is still in the incipient stage and it does not prohibit firefighters from fighting the fire from outside before sufficient personnel have arrived. It also does not prohibit firefighters from entering a burning structure to perform rescue operations when there is a reasonable belief that victims may be inside. It is only when firefighters are engaged in the interior attack of an interior structural firefighting that the &quot;two-in/two-out&quot; requirement applies.  The interpretation covers the number of persons who must be on the scene before fire fighting personnel may begin the interior attack on an interior structural fire. Until those persons arrive on the scene, fire fighters may fight the blaze from outside the structure and carry out rescue activities. 
Incipient stage fire 
An incipient stage fire is defined as a fire that is in the initial or beginning stage and can be controlled or extinguished by portable fire extinguishers, Class II standpipe, or small hose systems without the need for protective clothing or breathing apparatus.

* Note 2 to paragraph (g): Nothing in this section is meant to preclude firefighters from performing emergency rescue activities (Search) before an entire team has assembled. 

== Rapid intervention crew ==
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) defines the policy that refers to a safety system to protect firefighters, known as &quot;rapid intervention crew&quot; &quot;(RIC)&quot; or &quot;firefighter assist and search team&quot; &quot;(FAST)&quot;, where two or more firefighters enter a building and at least two more remain outside, near the entrance, fully equipped and ready to help in case of emergency.

Firefighters enter a building in teams to extinguish the fire and/or make a rescue. When a team enters an IDLH atmosphere (the &quot;two-in&quot;), two more firefighters (the &quot;two-out&quot;) stand by at the entrance in full personal protective equipment (to include bunker gear and self-contained breathing apparatus), and ready with rescue tools, in order to rapidly enter the building if the team inside becomes endangered. By some interpretations, the rule requires at least two &quot;more&quot; firefighters to &quot;remain&quot; outside, even when the standby team has gone in to find and rescue the first team. However, the rule specifically exempts an emergency rescue with fewer personnel on hand (i.e., no additional &quot;two-out&quot; required if they go in to find the &quot;two-in&quot;), although the increased risk to all four should be obvious if further backup is not on-scene.

The two firefighters who are specifically designated as standing by outside are referred to in different ways by many localities. The NFPA designated term is &quot;RIC&quot;, some are referred to as a &quot;rapid intervention team&quot;, and others are referred to as a &quot;F.A.S.T. truck&quot; (as in the Fire Department of New York).

Where there are teams working inside multiple entrances of a large structure fire, there may be standby teams designated at each entry point, although the rule does not necessarily mean two firefighters ready outside for &quot;every&quot; two inside.

Other tactics work within the rule to &quot;stage&quot; the next team, ready to relieve the inside team when their air supplies run low. When the third team arrives to serve as the RIT, the second team enters, follows the hose line to the first team and relieves them. This is naturally smoother with good radio communications between officers.

== Application in France ==
Until 1999, the firefighting in France was performed according to the &quot;Rules of instruction and maneuvers&quot; (&quot;Règlement d&#x27;instructions et de manoeuvres&quot;, RIM). The firefighters acted in teams of three members, called &quot;trinomial&quot; (&quot;trinôme&quot;): one chief, one deputy chief and one support; a fire engine with eight people thus had two trinom, an engine chief (&quot;chef d&#x27;agrès&quot;) and a driver. In the 1990s, the Paris Fire Brigade started to work with teams of two people, called &quot; teams&quot; (&quot;équipes en binôme&quot;) or shortly &quot;binomials&quot; (&quot;binômes&quot;). This organisation was generalised to the whole France in a departmental order signed by the minister of Internal Affairs the 3 February 1999. An engine with eight people now has three binomials, an engine chief and a driver; an engine with six people has two binomials, an engine chief and a driver.

A binomial can be assigned two types of missions:
* exploration and attack mission (&quot;binôme d&#x27;attaque&quot;, BAT);
* water supply and support mission (&quot;binôme d&#x27;alimentation&quot;, BAL).
The mission can change during an intervention (i.e., an attack binomial can become a supply binomial or &quot;vice versa&quot;).

The &quot;usual&quot; intervention (simple fire with only one fire engine and six people, no casualty, no specific risk) thus involves two binomials.
# The engine chief makes a reconnaissance with an attack binomial. The other binomial stands by outside, ready to help the reconnaissance team.
# The attack binomial unrolls the fire hoses at the &quot;attack point&quot; defined by the engine chief and prepare to go to the target also defined by the engine chief. The supply binomial joins the attack point to the fire engine with hoses.
# The attack binomial starts the firefighting. The supply binomial joins the fire engine to the hydrant.
# The supply binomial stands by, ready to help the attack binomial.
The overall organisation is the same when more engines are involved.

German fire services regulations (FwDV) demand that firefighters must always operate in teams of two, called a &quot;Trupp&quot;; and that an interior attack with breathing apparatus may only be undertaken if there&#x27;s at least a &quot;Staffel&quot; on scene, which consists of six firefighters: two &quot;Trupps&quot;, a commander, and an engineer. Furthermore, every incident scene where breathing apparatus is in use must have at least one &quot;Trupp&quot; with breathing apparatus on standby as a dedicated rescue team, and more where appropriate.

<text>Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier (; 21 February 181531 January 1891) was a French academic painter and sculptor. He became famous for his depictions of Napoleon and his military sieges and manoeuvres in paintings acclaimed both for the artist&#x27;s mastery of fine detail and his assiduous craftsmanship. The English art critic John Ruskin examined his work at length under a magnifying glass, &quot;marvelling at Meissonier&#x27;s manual dexterity and eye for fascinating minutiae.&quot; Meissonier enjoyed great success in his lifetime, becoming, with Gérôme and Cabanel, one of &quot;the three most successful artists of the Second Empire.&quot; 

Meissonier&#x27;s work commanded enormous prices and in 1846 he purchased a great mansion in Poissy, sometimes known as the Grande Maison. The Grande Maison included two large studios, the &quot;atelier d&#x27;hiver&quot;, or &quot;winter workshop&quot;, situated on the top floor of the house, and at ground level, a glass-roofed annexe, the &quot;atelier d&#x27;été&quot; or &quot;summer workshop&quot;. Meissonier himself said that his house and temperament belonged to another age, and some, like the critic Paul Mantz for example, criticised the artist&#x27;s seemingly limited repertoire. Like Alexandre Dumas, he excelled at depicting scenes of chivalry and masculine adventure against a backdrop of pre-Revolutionary and pre-industrial France, specialising in scenes from seventeenth- and eighteenth-century life.

==Biography==
Ernest Meissonier was born in Lyon. His father, Charles, had been a successful businessman, the proprietor of a factory in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, that made dyes for the textile industry. He expected Ernest, the eldest of his two sons, to follow him into the dye business. Yet from his schooldays Ernest showed a taste for painting, to which some early sketches, dated 1823, bear witness. After being placed with a druggist in the Rue des Lombards, at age seventeen, he obtained leave from his parents to become an artist. Following the recommendation of a painter named Potier, himself a second class Prix de Rome, he was admitted to Léon Cogniet&#x27;s studio. He also formed his style after the Dutch masters as represented in the Louvre.

He paid short visits to Rome and to Switzerland, and exhibited in the Salon of 1831 a painting then called &quot;Les Bourgeois Flamands&quot; (&quot;Dutch Burghers&quot;), but also known as &quot;The Visit to the Burgomaster&quot;, subsequently purchased by Sir Richard Wallace, in whose collection (at Hertford House, London) it is, with fifteen other examples of this painter. It was the first attempt in France in the particular genre which was destined to make Meissonier famous: microscopic painting miniature in oils. Working hard for daily bread at illustrations for the publishers Curmer, Hetzel and Dubocherhe, Meissonier also exhibited at the Salon of 1836 with &quot;Chess Player&quot; and the &quot;Errand Boy&quot;.

In 1838 Meissonier married a Protestant woman from Strasbourg named Emma Steinhel, the sister of M. Steinheil, one of his artistic companions. Two children were born in due course; Thérèse (1840), and Charles. On the birth registration of his daughter he described himself as a &quot;painter of history&quot;.

After some not very happy attempts at religious painting, he returned, under the influence of Antoine-Marie Chenavard, to the class of work he was born to excel in, and exhibited with much success the &quot;Game of Chess&quot; (1841), the &quot;Young Man playing the &#x27;Cello&quot; (1842),&quot; Painter in his Studio&quot; (1843), &quot;The Guard Room&quot;, the &quot;Young Man looking at Drawings&quot;, the &quot;Game of Piquet&quot; (1845), and the &quot;Game of Bowls&quot;, works which show the finish and certainty of his technique, and assured his success.

Meissonier became known as the &quot;French Metsu&quot;, a reference to the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Gabriel Metsu, who specialised in miniature scenes of bourgeois domestic life; &quot;grandiose history paintings did not sell as readily as smaller canvases such as landscapes or portraits, which fitted more easily onto the walls of Paris apartments&quot;. He specialised in scenes from seventeenth- and eighteenth-century life, portraying his &quot;bonshommes&quot;, or &quot;goodfellows&quot; - playing chess, smoking pipes, reading books, sitting before easels or double basses, or posing in the uniforms of musketeers or halberdiers [-] all executed in microscopic detail. Typical examples include &quot;Halt at an Inn&quot;, owned by the Duc de Morny and &quot;The Brawl&quot;, which was owned by Queen Victoria.

After his &quot;Soldiers&quot; (1848) he began &quot;A Day in June&quot;, which was never finished, and exhibited &quot;A Smoker&quot; (1849) and &quot;Bravos&quot; (&quot;Les Bravi&quot;, 1852). In 1855 he touched the highest mark of his achievement with &quot;The Gamblers&quot; and &quot;The Quarrel&quot; (&quot;La Rixe&quot;), which was presented by Napoleon III to the English Court. His triumph was sustained at the Salon of 1857, when he exhibited nine pictures, and drawings; among them the &quot;Young Man of the Time of the Regency&quot;, &quot;The Painter&quot;, &quot;The Shoeing Smith&quot;, &quot;The Musician&quot;, and &quot;A Reading at Diderot&#x27;s&quot;. When, in the summer of 1859, Emperor Napoleon III, together with Victor Emmanuel II King of Piedmont and Sardinia, tried to oust the Habsburgs from their territories in northern Italy, Meissonier received a government commission to illustrate scenes from the campaign. &quot;The Emperor Napoleon III at Solferino&quot; took Meissonier more than three years to complete. The work, a battle scene, represented something of a departure for the painter of &quot;bonshommes&quot; and musketeers though Meissonier had already painted scenes of violence and massacre, such as &quot;Remembrance of Civil War&quot;, and in 1848 had indeed seen active service as a captain in the National Guard, when he fought on the side of the republican government during the &quot;June Days&quot;. In autumn 1861 he was elected to a chair in the when the members of the voted for him to join their number. To the Salon of 1861 he sent &quot;A Shoeing Smith&quot;, &quot;A Musician&quot;, &quot;A Painter&quot;, and &quot;M. Louis Fould&quot;; to that of 1864 &quot;The Emperor at Solferino&quot;, and &quot;1814&quot;. He subsequently exhibited &quot;A Gamblers&#x27; Quarrel&quot; (1865) and &quot;Desaix and the Army of the Rhine&quot; (1867).

In June 1868 Meissonier travelled to Antibes with canvas and easel, together with his wife, son and daughter, and two of his horses, Bachelier and Lady Coningham. He may have been attracted there for historical reasonsin 1794 Napoleon had been imprisoned in Fort Carré, and in 1815, returning from exile on Elba in 1815 he had come ashore at Golfe-Jouanand the island of Sainte-Marguerite where the Man in the Iron Mask was imprisoned 1686–1698, was a little out to sea.

The light of the south attracted Meissonnier. &quot;It is delightful to sun oneself in the brilliant light of the South instead of wandering about like gnomes in the fog. The view at Antibes is one of the fairest sights in nature.&quot; And it is possible that the influence of &quot;plein-air&quot; landscapists had encouraged Meissonier to abandon for a while his obsession with historical authenticity in favour of something more spontaneous: &quot; of creating eye-catching visual effects by means of a few salient touches of the brush. If these Antibes landscapes never matched [-] the work of Pissarro, they nonetheless revealed Meissonier as a painter of remarkable versatility whose ambitions were not entirely at odds with those of the École des Batignolles.&quot;
Meissonier worked with elaborate care and a scrupulous observation of nature. Some of his works, as for instance his &quot;1807&quot;, remained ten years in course of execution. To the great Exhibition of 1878 he contributed sixteen pictures: the portrait of Alexandre Dumas fils which had been seen at the Salon of 1877, &quot;Cuirassiers of 1805&quot;, &quot;A Venetian Painter&quot;, &quot;Moreau and his Staff before Hohenlinden&quot;, a &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, the &quot;Road to La Salice&quot;, &quot;The Two Friends&quot;, &quot;The Outpost of the Grand Guard&quot;, &quot;A Scout&quot;, and &quot;Dictating his Memoirs&quot;. Thenceforward he exhibited less in the Salons, and sent his work to smaller exhibitions. Being chosen president of the Great National Exhibition in 1883, he was represented there by such works as &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, &quot;The Army of the Rhine,&quot; &quot;The Arrival of the Guests,&quot; and &quot;Saint Mark.&quot;

On 24 May 1884 an exhibition was opened at the Petit Gallery of Meissonier&#x27;s collected works, including 146 examples. As president of the jury on painting at the Exhibition of 1889 he contributed some new pictures. In the following year the &quot;New Salon&quot; was formed (the &quot;Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts&quot;), and Meissonier became its president. He exhibited there in 1890 his painting &quot;1807&quot;; and in 1891, shortly after his death, his &quot;Barricade&quot; was displayed there.

A less well-known class of work than his painting is a series of etchings: &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, &quot;The Skill of Vuillaume the Lute Player&quot;, &quot;The Little Smoker&quot;, &quot;The Old Smoker&quot;, the &quot;Preparations for a Duel&quot;, &quot;Anglers&quot;, &quot;Troopers&quot;, &quot;The Reporting Sergeant&quot;, and &quot;Polichinelle&quot;, in the Hertford House collection. He also tried lithography, but the prints are now scarcely to be found. Of all the painters of the century, Meissonier was one of the most fortunate in the matter of payments. His &quot;Cuirassiers&quot;, now in the late duc d&#x27;Aumale&#x27;s collection at Chantilly, was bought from the artist for £10,000, sold at Brussels for £11,000, and then resold for £16,000.

Besides his genre portraits, he painted some others: those of &quot;Doctor Lefevre&quot;, of &quot;Chenavard&quot;, of &quot;Vanderbilt&quot;, of &quot;Doctor Guyon&quot;, and of &quot;Stanford&quot;. He also collaborated with the painter Français in a picture of &quot;The Park at St Cloud&quot;.
Meissonier was attached by Napoleon III to the imperial staff, and accompanied him during the campaign in Italy at the beginning of the war in 1870. During the Siege of Paris (1870–1871) he was colonel of a regiment de marche, one of the improvised units thrown up in the chaos of the Franco-Prussian war. In 1840 he was awarded a third-class medal, a second-class medal in 1841, first-class medals in 1843 and 1844 and medals of honour at the great exhibitions. In 1846 he was appointed knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and promoted to the higher grades in 1856, 1867 (June 29), and 1880 (July 12), receiving the Grand Cross in 1889 (October 29).

He nevertheless cherished certain ambitions which remained unfulfilled. He hoped to become a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, but the appointment he desired was never given to him. He also aspired to be chosen deputy or made senator, but he was not elected. In 1861 he succeeded Abel de Pujol as member of the Academy of Fine Arts. On the occasion of the centenary festival in honour of Michelangelo in 1875 he was the delegate of the Institute of France to Florence, and spoke as its representative. Meissonier was an admirable draughtsman upon wood, his illustrations to &quot;Les Conties Rémois&quot; (engraved by Lavoignat), to Lamartine&#x27;s &quot;Fall of an Angel to Paul and Virginia&quot;, and to &quot;The French Painted by Themselves&quot; being among the best known. The leading engravers and etchers of France have been engaged upon plates from the works of Meissonier, and many of these plates command the highest esteem of collectors. Meissonier died in Paris on 31 January 1891.
When the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts was re-vitalized, in 1890, Ernest Meissonier was elected its first chairman, but he died soon; his successor was Puvis de Chavannes. The vice-president was Auguste Rodin.

His son, Jean Charles Meissonier, also a painter, was his father&#x27;s pupil, and was admitted to the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1889.

Rue Meissonier, in the 17th Arrondissement in Paris, France, is named after him.

In 2020, Meissonier&#x27;s painting &quot;Joueurs d’échecs&quot; was restituted to the heirs of Marguerite Stern, from whom it was looted under the Nazis.

<text>Horatio Collins King (December 22, 1837 – November 15, 1918) was a Union Army soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the American Civil War. He also served as a U.S. lawyer, politician and author.

==Biography==

Born in Portland, Maine, King graduated from Dickinson College in 1858, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in New York City in 1861. He served in the armies of the Potomac and Shenandoah during the Civil War from August 1862 until May 1865, when he resigned with the rank of brevet colonel.
King earned the Medal of Honor for service near Dinwiddie Courthouse, Virginia, on March 31, 1865.

King then practiced law until 1870, when he became connected with the press. He was the author of &quot;The Plymouth Silver Wedding&quot; (New York, 1873); &quot;The Brooklyn Congregational Council&quot; (1876); &quot;King&#x27;s Guide to Regimental Courts-Martial&quot; (1882); and edited &quot;Proceedings of the Army of the Potomac&quot; (1879–&#x27;87).

In 1883, King was appointed judge-advocate-general of New York.

At a time during which anti-Chinese views were common, King was socially friendly with the Chinese minister in Washington, D.C., and the Chinese consul in New York. In 1893, when the anti-Chinese Geary Act was ruled constitutional, he protested the law, saying that &quot;from the prejudice manifested against the Chinese, it seems they have no rights here that Americans are bound to respect.&quot;

In 1895, he ran on the Democratic ticket for Secretary of State of New York, but was defeated by Republican John Palmer.

In 1912, he ran on the Progressive ticket for New York State Comptroller, but was defeated by Democrat William Sohmer.

King was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Sons of the American Revolution. King was the Secretary of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.

His father, Horatio King, was Postmaster General of the United States.

<doc id="977679" wikidata="Q5713175" url="?curid=977679" title="Henderson, New Zealand">
<text>Henderson ( or ) is a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is west of Auckland city centre, and west of the Whau River, a southwestern arm of the Waitematā Harbour. 

Henderson initially developed around the mill of Thomas Henderson and was known as &quot;Henderson&#x27;s Mill&quot;. As it expanded it became known as just Henderson and later it became an independent borough. As part of the 1989 local government reforms it became the centre of Waitakere City until Waitakere City was amalgamated to form the new Auckland Council.

== Geography ==

Henderson is located between the Waitākere Ranges to the west, and the Te Atatū Peninsula in the east. The area is within the catchment of Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek, an estuarial arm of the Waitematā Harbour. The Ōpanuku, Oratia, Swanson, Momutu and Paremuka streams meet at Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek, to the north of Henderson.

Between 3 and 5 million years ago, tectonic forces uplifted the Waitākere Ranges and central Auckland, while subsiding the Manukau and inner Waitematā harbours. The land at Henderson is formed from Waitemata Group sandstone, which was previously found at the bottom of a deep sedimentary basin. Land close to Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek and the Waitematā Harbour are formed from rhyolitic clays and peat, formed from eroding soil and interactions with the harbour. Prior to human contact, the Henderson area was home to broadleaf forests, dominated by pūriri, karaka, kohekohe and māhoe trees. The alluvial creek/harbour zone was favoured by kahikatea, pukatea and rātā, with tī kōuka (cabbage trees) flourishing in wetter sites.

===Climate===

==History==

Henderson is in the traditional rohe of Te Kawerau ā Maki, and the name Ōpanuku refers to the Ōpanuku Stream, traditionally known as Te Wai-ō-Panuku (&quot;The Stream of Panuku&quot;), Panuku being the name of one of the earliest Te Kawerau ā Maki ancestors. The lower Opanuku Stream area was called Waitaro, referring to the taro cultivations grown there.

The point where the Opanuku and Oratia Streams meet (the Tui Glen Reserve / Falls Park area) is the beginning of Te Wai-o-Pareira, also known as the Henderson Creek, and the point where the creek became navigable by waka. This point was strategically important to Te Kawerau ā Maki, and was the location of a small fortified pā known as Te Kōpua. Kōpūpāka was the name of a kāinga close to Te Kōpua, which was used as a temporary settlement by Ngāti Whātua during the Musket Wars in the 1820s, during a brief lull in conflict. After the Musket Wars, Te Kawerau ā Maki returned to the area in the 1830s, and most members chose to settle close to a defensive pā at Te Henga / Bethells Beach.

Henderson is named after early colonial settler Thomas Henderson, a Scottish immigrant who purchased land from Ngati Whatua in 1844 and established a timber mill on the banks of Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek ca. 1847 to process the logs of kauri trees which were cut from the Henderson Valley and further upstream, from the eastern flanks of the Waitākere Ranges. The community which developed around the mill was known as Henderson&#x27;s Mill, and later the Henderson&#x27;s Mill Settlement. The first European settlers in the community were mill workers, who were joined gum diggers, farm workers and brick makers. In 1855, George Pirrit and his son William Pirrit bought land at Henderson adjacent to the Oratia Stream, which they dammed in order to operate a water turbine, manufacturing iron heel and toe plates for boots. In the following year, a hotel was opened on the town&#x27;s main street.

The mill closed in the latter 1860s, and in 1875 the area was hit by a major flood, damaging crops and bridges near the settlement. The area became more prosperous in the 1880s, after the North Auckland Railway opened between Auckland and Helensville. When the Henderson railway station was opened, the name was displayed as Henderson Mill, with the possessive dropped. Overtime, goods to the area sent by rail began adopting this name, and eventually the settlement was referred to as Henderson. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Henderson was the location of a number of brick and pottery yards adjacent to Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek. The major brick industries in West Auckland were located to the south, along the Whau River. In 1896, a community hall was built at Henderson, hosting concerts for the West Auckland area. This was destroyed by fire in 1924, and rebuilt in brick.

In 1907, Lebanese New Zealander Assid Abraham Corban developed a vineyard at Henderson. After the sale of alcohol was prohibited in Henderson during the temperance movement, Corban set up a depot at the border of the prohibition area on the eastern side of the railway tracks, in order to sell his projects.

By the 1920s, the Lincoln Road, Swanson Road and Sturgess Road areas had developed into orchards run primarily by Dalmatian families who immigrated to New Zealand, including the included Bilich (later White), Babich, Boric, Yelavich and Fredatovich families. During this time, the Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek at Tui Glen Reserve had become a popular waterway for leisure and a site for pleasure boating. The first modern brick block of shops were built in the area in 1932. In the early 1930s, a kauri gum refinery was constructed on Station Road, however this closed down in 1936 after a market slump.

== Amenities and attractions ==

Henderson features a large shopping centre, WestCity Waitakere, with numerous other shops and large stores also located in the area. The West Wave Pool and Leisure Centre, owned by the Auckland Council, was built to host the Aquatics at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.

The Corban&#x27;s Wine Estate and Corban Estate Arts Centre are both located in Henderson. The annual InterACT Disability Arts Festival is held at the gallery. At the northern end of Henderson, near the Lincoln Road motorway interchange, the &quot;Toroa&quot;, a historic ferry under restoration, is a well-known local landmark.

The Trusts Stadium attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year, hosting a range of events, including concerts, sporting events and community gatherings. The Trusts Stadium was completed in August 2004 and was opened by then Prime Minister Helen Clark the following month. It cost $28 million to complete but opened debt-free, with The Trusts providing $5 million, Waitakere City Council contributing $12.5 million and ASB Charitable Trusts providing $4.5 million.

Falls Hotel is a historic hotel located in Falls Park along Alderman Drive. It currently hosts a café and restaurant.

<doc id="977680" wikidata="Q884371" url="?curid=977680" title="Blindside (band)">
<text>Blindside is a Swedish rock band from the southern suburbs of Stockholm. They formed in Stockholm in 1994 as Underfree. In 1996, they changed their name to Blindside and released the &quot;Blindside&quot; album in 1997 through Swedish independent record company Day-Glo Records. Another album, &quot;A Thought Crushed My Mind&quot;, came out in 2000. The group received greater attention in 2001 when they toured with P.O.D., resulting in a contract with Elektra. In 2002 they released the album &quot;Silence&quot; and in 2003 they toured in support of Hoobastank. A 2004 headlining tour suffered equipment theft but then Blindside released &quot;About a Burning Fire&quot;. In 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Blindside&#x27;s label ceased to exist, &amp; the next year they released &quot;The Great Depression&quot; independently, and they put out the DVD &quot;Ten Years Running Blind&quot;.

Blindside independently released another EP in 2007 – &quot;The Black Rose EP&quot; – but then they went on hiatus from most band activity until 2011, when they released &quot;With Shivering Hearts We Wait&quot;.
In 2019 they released a new single &quot;Gravedigger&quot;. Since then, they have played to a packed crowd at Furnace Fest 2022.

==History==

===Beginnings, self-titled album and &quot;A Thought Crushed My Mind&quot; (1994–2001)===
Blindside was formed in 1994. In 1997, Blindside debuted in Sweden with their self-titled debut, a collection of old and new songs that were based on singer Christian Lindskog&#x27;s life at the time. In 1998 Blindside released the &quot;Empty Box EP&quot; on Day-Glo Records. In 1997, Tooth &amp; Nail Records signed a licensing deal with Blindside. The US debut was released later that year by Tooth &amp; Nail and featured songs both from the Swedish full-length debut and from the EP Empty Box. In 2000, &quot;A Thought Crushed My Mind&quot; was released. &quot;A Thought Crushed My Mind&quot; was more harsh and hardcore than the band&#x27;s debut, and vocalist/chief lyricist Christian Lindskog also voiced his pain of missing his wife, Elina, while touring. It would be Blindside&#x27;s final album with Solid State. Fellow group P.O.D. began actively endorsing Blindside and signed them to Elektra Records under the imprint 3 Points.

=== &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;About a Burning Fire&quot; (2002–2004) ===
In 2002 Blindside released &quot;Silence&quot;. It generated hits such as &quot;Sleepwalking&quot;, &quot;Pitiful,&quot; and &quot;Caught a Glimpse.&quot; They appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and performed their hit song &quot;Pitiful&quot;.
In 2003, they toured with Hoobastank to support the album. Also in 2003, the band appeared in the skateboarding film &quot;Grind&quot;, performing the song &quot;Pitiful&quot; at a skate competition. In 2004, &quot;About a Burning Fire&quot; was released. It debuted on the Billboard album chart at #39 and generated a minor hit in &quot;All of Us.&quot; The album showed the band toying with their diversity, as they threw in techno elements in &quot;Where The Sun Never Dies&quot; and yodeling Swedish vocals in the ethereal &quot;Shekina&quot;. &quot;Shekina&quot; is a Jewish and Christian name for the outer presence of God&#x27;s glory, and this song title expresses Blindside&#x27;s spiritual side in their music. &quot;Shekina&quot; was used on WWE DVD, &quot;Cheating Death, Stealing Life - The Eddie Guerrero Story&quot;. The track &quot;Swallow&quot; was used in the soundtrack for the game Need for Speed Underground 1. The track &quot;Hooray, It&#x27;s L.A.&quot; features the guitar and back up vocals of Billy Corgan, recorded during his recession from The Smashing Pumpkins. In mid 2004, the Warner Music Group was sold to private investors, Blindside decided to part ways with Elektra due to ending up in a catalogue with hundreds of artists under Atlantic Records. The Blindside Union and P.O.D. Warriors, the two bands&#x27; street teams, stepped in to help in promotion. However, the headlining tour was marred by several incidents. First, their tour bus crashed and was in disrepair, forcing the band to rent a van. Secondly, their last show in Bartlesville, OK had to be canceled. After dining in a restaurant in Dallas, TX, they found everything in their rental van stolen, including passports and money.

Following in 2005, Blindside re-released their two Solid State LPs with bonus tracks and new cover art. A DVD titled &quot;Ten Years Running Blind&quot; was released on 21 June 2005.

=== &quot;The Great Depression&quot; and &quot;The Black Rose EP&quot; (2005–2007) ===
&quot;The Great Depression&quot;, was released on 2 August 2005. &quot;The Great Depression&quot; showcased Blindside experimenting with multiple new genres. Many jazzy elements were incorporated, such as &quot;My Alibi&quot; and &quot;City Lights.&quot; Guest vocalists were incorporated, namely Ilkka from Benea Reach and Selfmindead, as well as J. Jamte. Ilkka sang alongside Christian Lindskog in &quot;Come To Rest&quot;, while J. Jamte contributed to &quot;You Must Be Bleeding Under Your Eyelids.&quot;

Blindside released &quot;The Black Rose EP&quot;, on 27 June 2007 and toured the United States in support of it in late 2007. This EP included five new songs and three live songs, and is only available for purchase in Sweden, Blindside concerts, and online.

=== Hiatus (2008–2010) ===
Blindside has been performing a new song called &quot;Remember December&quot; from their upcoming album.
Christian and Simon have also been performing in a side project named Lindforest (The English translation of Christian&#x27;s Swedish lastname &quot;Lindskog&quot;).
Blindside took some time off throughout 2008 but also has written new songs and is expected to release a new album.

On 1 May 2009 it was announced that Blindside would be performing at a free showcase that will be held in Las Vegas at the Thomas and Mack Center on 29 August 2009, along with Flyleaf, Brian Welch and P.O.D., among others.

On 29 July 2009 Blindside announced that they were going to be making a new album, to be produced by Howard Benson.

On 21 November 2010 Blindside tweeted: &quot;Hung out with our friends from Papa Roach this week in Stockholm and played them the new record. Cant wait for all you guys to hear it!&quot; Papa Roach claimed the album would be released in March 2011.

=== &quot;With Shivering Hearts We Wait&quot; (2011–present) ===

On 7 February 2011 Blindside posted an image on their Facebook and Twitter accounts with a possible Album Title and a date &quot;028/002/011&quot;.

A short video with a clip of a new song was added to their official website on 28 February 2011. The underground release date for &quot;With Shivering Hearts We Wait&quot; was 6 May 2011. The worldwide release date was 7 June 2011.

On 11 March 2011 at 9:05 CET Blindside released their new single &quot;Monster on the Radio,&quot; on Swedish airwaves.

On 1 April 2011 Blindside released a promotional website containing songs from the new album. A new song was released each week leading to the album&#x27;s release.

On 3 April 2012 it was reported that Blindside had signed a new contract with BMG European Distribution Company.

On 3 July 2019, the band released the song &quot;Gravedigger&quot;.

<text>The ten Pan-European transport corridors were defined at the second Pan-European transport Conference in Crete, March 1994, as routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the next ten to fifteen years. Additions were made at the third conference in Helsinki in 1997. Therefore, these corridors are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Crete corridors&quot; or &quot;Helsinki corridors&quot;, regardless of their geographical locations. 

These development corridors are distinct from the Trans-European transport networks, which is a European Union project and include all major established routes in the European Union, although there are proposals to combine the two systems, since most of the involved countries now are members of the EU.

The corridors variously encompass road, rail and waterway routes.

<doc id="977687" wikidata="Q15262068" url="?curid=977687" title="New Lynn">
<text>New Lynn is a residential suburb in West Auckland, New Zealand, located 10 kilometres to the southwest of the Auckland city centre. The suburb is located along the Whau River, one of the narrowest points of the North Island, and was the location of Te Tōanga Waka, a traditional waka portage between the Waitematā and Manukau harbours.

The settlement developed in the early 20th century due to the brick and pottery industry, and in 1963 became a major commercial centre for Auckland with the opening of LynnMall, the first American-style shopping centre in New Zealand. Since 2010, New Lynn has been the focus of large-scale urban development, with the introduction of medium and high density housing close to the town centre and train station.

==History==
===Early history and establishment===
The New Lynn area and the Whau River are a part of the traditional rohe of Te Kawerau ā Maki, an iwi that traces their ancestry to some of the earliest inhabitants of the Auckland Region. The traditional name for the area is Te Rewarewa, referring to a local creek. The Whau River was a borderland, marking the division of lands between Te Kawerau ā Maki and the Tāmaki Māori iwi of the Auckland isthmus: Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and in earlier times, Waiohua. The Whau River was one of the narrowest points between the Waitematā Harbour on the east coast of the island, and the Manukau Harbour on the west. Te Tōanga Waka, one of the most important portages in the area, allowed for waka to be transported between the two harbours, along the Whau River, the Avondale Stream (Wai Tahurangi), and a short overland path, marked in modern times by a road named Portage Road. Kotuitanga (Ken Maunder Park) marks the point where waka were no longer able to be paddled, and was traditionally a site used for waka construction. The banks of the Whau River were the locations of many seasonal fishing settlements.

When European colonisation of the Auckland Region began, New Lynn was known as a barren scrubland. In 1845, the first wooden bridge was built across the Whau River. New Lynn was named by Frederick Utting, who surveyed the western Whau area in 1863. He named the area after King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, England, as the area reminded him of the countryside of his homeland. Land at New Lynn was first auctioned in 1865, but growth in the area was slow until the 1910s.

The first European settlers arrived in the area in the 1850s, primarily farmers and people involved with the kauri logging and gum digging industries. In 1865, New Lynn became a trade centre when the port of New Lynn opened on the Whau River. Boats could only operate in the port during narrow stretches of time at high tide, and otherwise rested in the mud of the river.

New Lynn grew significantly due to the brick and ceramics industries. The first brickyard was established by Dr Daniel Pollen on the Whau River at Rosebank in 1852. He brought in brickmakers from Staffordshire in England, four of whom later established their own yards along the river. By 1870 there were 13 brick and clay yards on the local waterways, exploiting the high-quality clay in the area. In the 1870s, the largest yards produced between 10,000 and 15,000 bricks per week. Many of the ceramics companies failed due to the 1880s depression, competition, and changing preferences to use wood rather than bricks for construction. The first brick kiln opened in New Lynn in 1861, and of the 39 brick and clayworks of West Auckland, 23 were located on the Whau River, with most concentrated around New Lynn.

In March 1880, the New Lynn railway station opened, connecting New Lynn to Auckland by rail and stimulating growth in the area. Two years later, Alfred Ramsden constructed the New Lynn Hotel on Great North Road, which closed in 1908 due to their liquor license lapsing during the temperance movement in New Zealand. The building was demolished in July 2008, due to deterioration. The first school in the area, New Lynn School, opened in 1888 at the modern site of Kelston Girls&#x27; College. The school was relocated to current site in 1914.

A new area of New Lynn was subdivided in 1902, to the south of the railway station. Known as the Hetana Hamlet, this was named after Prime Minister Richard Seddon, who was known to Māori by the name Hetana.

===Suburban development===
In the early 1900s, a group of citizens led by Archibald Grandison lobbied the Waitemata County for New Lynn to become an independent town district. Grandison and his supporters felt that New Lynn would grow as an outer city suburb of Auckland in the future, and had very different needs to the majority of the rural communities in the county. The population grew five times between 1900 and 1910, and in August of the following year, New Lynn became a town district. By 1 April 1919 it had grown enough to become a borough, allowing the council to take out larger loans to invest in the infrastructure of the area. Many of the street names in New Lynn are named for commissioners of the town and borough, as well as indigenous tree species. During the early 20th century, a significant Scottish immigrant population moved to New Lynn.

The Astley Tannery, which first opened in 1888, became one of the largest employers in New Lynn during World War I when demand for leather goods significantly increased. The business was greatly successful in the 1930s, closing in the 1990s. Industrial waste from the tannery and neighbouring abattoir was discharged directly into the Whau River, becoming a major source of pollution for the waterway.

In 1925, Rice Owen Clark moved his large clay pipeworks factory from Hobsonville to New Lynn. Due to the pressures of the Great Depression, the various brick and ceramics businesses of West Auckland merged to form the Amalgamated Brick and Pipe Compan in 1929, who focused operations at New Lynn. The company were able to produce up to 30,000 red facing bricks per fortnight at their Ambrico kiln. The brickworks was known for its 46-metre-high chimney in central New Lynn.

In 1926, the Delta Theatre opened in New Lynn, becoming a focal point of the community, holding a range of events including film showings, live entertainment and dances. The theatre was demolished 1986. A new bridge crossing the Whau River was completed in December 1931, replacing the older wooden structures on Great North Road. The bridge was a point of contention between the New Lynn borough council and the Waitemata County and Auckland City, who wanted a bridge of a significantly smaller size to what the borough council proposed. By 1935, the population of New Lynn had grown to 3,500.

===Crown Lynn and LynnMall===

During World War II, New Lynn was considered a vulnerable area by the government, due to the brickworks and its proximity to the border of Auckland City. Because of this, concrete machine gun posts and barbed wire were installed along the railway between Portage Road and St Georges Road, tank traps were built in the area, and air raid shelters were built at the corner of Margan and Seabrooke Avenues. Due to restrictions on the importation of British goods during the war, the Amalgamated Brick and Pottery began mass-producing crockery for the New Zealand market, growing to become one of the largest brick and ceramics companies in the Southern Hemisphere, known for their Crown Lynn pottery range. The ceramics industry led to widescale immigration of Pasifika New Zealanders to the area during the 1960s and 1970s, many of whom were employed at the Crown Lynn Potteries factories.

The port of New Lynn closed for commercial operations in 1948, when a final shipment of bricks and mānuka were transported from the port on the &quot;Rahiri&quot;.

In 1963, LynnMall, the first modern American-style shopping centre in New Zealand was opened in New Lynn. It immediately became a retail hub for Auckland, and influenced the nearby Henderson borough to create a similar mall, the Henderson Square (now known as WestCity Waitakere). In September 1974, New Zealand&#x27;s first Pizza Hut restaurant opened in New Lynn.

In 1978, a new bridge across the Whau River was built along Rata Street, acting as a bypass to divert traffic away from New Lynn and Great North Road. On 17 July 1981, the Jack McCorquindale Community Centre opened in New Lynn, named after a former borough mayor.

In 1989, the Amalgamated Brick and Pipe Company (then known as Ceramco) closed down operations. In the same year, New Lynn ceased being an independent borough, merging with other local governments of West Auckland in the local body reforms of 1989 to become a part of the Waitakere City.

===Urban development===
In 2010, the New Lynn railway station was redeveloped as a transport hub, with a new station constructed and the existing tracks moved into an underground trench. This was the start of an urban revitalisation project for New Lynn, where the New Lynn town centre was redeveloped as a commercial centre and mid to high density residential hub. The first stage of the Merchant Quarter, immediately adjacent to the train station, was completed in 2013, and the Merchant Quarter Apartments, one of the tallest buildings in West Auckland, was opened in 2015. As of 2020, New Lynn is the major commercial centre of the Whau local board area, and one of the major commercial hubs of West Auckland.

Te Toi Uku: Crown Lynn Clayworks Museum opened in May 2015.

On 3 September 2021, seven people were injured in a stabbing attack at the Countdown supermarket in LynnMall.

==Local government==

From 1876 until 1929, New Lynn was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1929, the area split from the county, forming the New Lynn Borough Council. Between 1929 and 1989, 78 councillors (also known as commissioners) served on the borough council. In 1989, the borough was merged into the Waitakere City. Waitakere City Council was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, New Lynn is a part of the Whau local government area governed by the Whau Local Board. It is a part of the Whau ward, which elects one councillor to the Auckland Council.

==Transport==
New Lynn Railway Station, located next to the bus transport centre and the LynnMall shopping centre, was upgraded in 2008–2010 to cater for the increased frequency of trains expected on the Auckland regional network after its electrification. The section of track on the Western line between Portage Road and Titirangi Road was trenched to allow trains to pass beneath the New Lynn town centre. A twin-platform station was built below road level near the site of the existing station. As part of the redevelopment projects for the area, part of Totara Avenue, in the New Lynn town centre, was transformed into a shared space.

New Lynn has had ready road access to the Auckland CBD since the Northwestern Motorway and an expressway through Waterview were completed in the late 1970s.

<text>Childebert III the Adopted (&quot;Childebertus Adoptivus&quot;) was a Frankish king.

Childebert was a son of the Mayor of the Palace Grimoald the Elder. He was thus a grandson of Pepin of Landen.

He was adopted by King Sigebert III and Queen Chimnechild.

When Sigebert III died in 656, Grimoald had Sigebert’s biological son Dagobert II tonsured and sent him to an Irish monastery and then proclaimed Childebert king of Austrasia.

Grimoald, Childebert and Ansegisel (who had married the daughter of Pepin of Landen) were finally seized and turned over to the king of Neustria, Clovis II, who had them killed. There are two differing accounts of his death, however. Either Clovis and his mayor of the palace, Erchinoald, captured and executed him in 657 or Chlothar III annexed Austrasia in 661, deposing the young usurper and executing them both the next year.

The family reappeared in politics with the rise of Ansegisel’s son, Pepin of Herstal.

<text>Julius Oral &quot;Little Man&quot; Popwell (June 1, 1912 – May 19, 1966) was an American poker player.

==Biography==
Popwell is one of the most famous poker players from the first half of the 20th century. His preferred game was five card stud, and he often played against other poker legends such as Johnny Moss. He was posthumously inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1996.

Despite his nickname, Popwell was obese, weighing over 300 pounds (136 kg) while standing 5&#x27;6&quot; tall. The nickname &quot;Little Man&quot; actually came from his prowess in billiards when he was a teenager, because he could regularly beat men over twice his age.

He operated lotteries and card games from his home near Birmingham, Alabama, and on April 3, 1954, he was sentenced to 366 days in jail and fined $250 for this, as well as income tax evasion.

<text>Thomas R. Karl (born 22 November 1951, in Evergreen Park, Illinois) is the former director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). He joined the National Climate Centre in 1980, and when that became the National Climatic Data Center, he continued as a researcher, becoming a Lab Chief, Senior Scientist and ultimately Director of the Center. When it merged with other centers to become NCEI in 2015, he became its first director. He retired on 4 August 2016.

==Global warming hiatus debate==
Karl was the lead on a study on the question of the possible existence of a hiatus in global warming, as discussed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report . In the study, published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) &quot;Science&quot; journal in June 2015 and based on previously published datasets, they found no indication of a slowdown, even in the period from 1998 to 2012 which had been highlighted by the IPCC. This analysis incorporated the latest homogenization corrections for known biases in ocean temperature measurements as published by others in NOAA&#x27;s Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature dataset version 4, and land temperatures from the new International Surface Temperature Initiative dataset, integrated with NOAA’s Global Historical Climatology Network. Scientists working on other datasets welcomed this study, though the view was expressed at the time that the short term warming trend had been slower than in previous periods of the same length. After he published these results, Karl was attacked by climate change denialists, including Lamar Smith, chair of the House Science Committee. In 2017 the findings of the Karl et al. study were confirmed by another group of scientists using different methodologies.

<doc id="977707" wikidata="Q997355" url="?curid=977707" title="Irish Ferries">
<text>Irish Ferries is an Irish ferry and transport company that operates passenger and freight services on routes between Ireland, Britain and Continental Europe, including Dublin Port–Holyhead; Rosslare Europort to Pembroke as well as Dublin Port-Cherbourg in France.

The company is a division of the Irish Continental Group (ICG) which trades on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. ICG also owns the Eucon container line which operates vessels on routes operating between Ireland and the continent.

Irish Ferries&#x27; flagship, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, is currently the largest ROPAX ferry operating on the Irish Sea and when launched in 2001 was the world&#x27;s largest car ferry in terms of car-carrying capacity. Other ships in the fleet include &quot;W.B. Yeats&quot;, &quot;Isle of Inishmore&quot;, &quot;Isle of Innisfree&quot;, &quot;Isle of Inisheer&quot; and the fast ferry &quot;Dublin Swift&quot; (preceded by , which operated until 2018). The company also charters ro-pax vessel &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; (formerly named &quot;Spirit of Britain&quot;), with a purchase option on the vessel. 

==History==
Irish Continental Line was formed in 1973 as a joint venture between Irish Shipping, Fearnley &amp; Eger and Swedish company Lion Ferry. It originally operated on the Rosslare–Le Havre route with the 547 berth, 210 car ferry &quot;Saint Patrick&quot;. When Irish Shipping went into liquidation in 1984, Irish Continental Line was sold off in a management buyout and emerged as Irish Continental Group.

In 1992, ICG took over the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited, a nationalised company which traded under the name B&amp;I Line and operated ferry services between Dublin and Holyhead and between Rosslare and Pembroke Dock.

In 2005, Irish Ferries replaced all its workers with foreign agency labour that was cheaper than that of its rivals, such as P&amp;O Ferries, Stena Line and DFDS, thereby undercutting their prices. Its competitive practice, as well as the use of security personnel to carry out the replacement of its crewmembers, were described by many in the industry as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for P&amp;O&#x27;s 2022 sacking of hundreds of its seafarers.

===Investment===
As part of its offer to buy B&amp;I Line, management at ICG undertook to invest in replacing what was an ageing fleet. Over the following decade, a programme of fleet renewal was undertaken involving investment of €500 million to create what was described as the most modern ferry fleet in western Europe.
New vessels were built such as &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;Isle of Innisfree&quot; (now on charter in New Zealand as &quot;Kaitaki&quot;), &quot;Isle of Inishmore&quot; and a fast ferry &quot;Jonathan Swift&quot;, all for service on its Ireland–UK routes. As a result, the company put itself in a position to attract increased passenger and freight business, influenced by the modern facilities and improved reliability of each vessel and the extra capacity that was available on board.

On 31 May 2016, ICG announced that it had entered into an agreement with the German company Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft to build a cruise ferry at a contract price of €144 million. The new cruise ferry can accommodate 1,880 passengers and crew, with 435 cabins and with capacity for 2,800 lane metres of freight (165 freight vehicles) plus an additional dedicated car deck with capacity for 300 passenger cars. Summer 2018 bookings for the new ferry were cancelled due to delays in its delivery from the shipyard.

In March 2021, Irish Ferries in a surprise announcement revealed that they were opening a new route between Dover and Calais, due to start in June, later revealed to be June 29th. This is the first such route that Irish Ferries operates which does not call in Ireland, with Dover and Calais being two major UK and French ports respectively. The service began with the operating between the two ports, with two more ships due to enter service – the MS &quot;Isle of Innisfree&quot; (1991, ex-&quot;Calais Seaways&quot;) in December 2021, and (ex- &quot;Ciudad de Mahón&quot;)&quot; in April 2022&quot;.&quot;

==Awards==
In 2001, the newly completed vessel &quot;Ulysses&quot; was awarded the title &#x27;Most Significant Newbuild – Ferry&#x27; by Lloyds List Cruise &amp; Ferry. In 2019, the latest addition to its fleet, &quot;W.B. Yeats&quot; was awarded the &#x27;Ferry Concept Award&#x27; and the &#x27;Interior Architecture Award&#x27; at the international Shippax Industry Awards.

==Fleet==
In 2005, Irish Ferries began to re-register its fleet under flags of convenience, enabling the company to save approximately €11.5 million by replacing crew with agency staff. As of February 2018, all vessels owned by Irish Ferries or Irish Continental Group are registered in either the Bahamas or Cyprus.

<doc id="977709" wikidata="Q752951" url="?curid=977709" title="At San Quentin">
<text>Johnny Cash at San Quentin is the 31st overall album and second live album by American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969, and released on June 16 of that same year. The concert was filmed by Granada Television, produced and directed by Michael Darlow. The album was the second in Cash&#x27;s conceptual series of live prison albums that also included &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; (1968), &quot;På Österåker&quot; (1973), and &quot;A Concert Behind Prison Walls&quot; (1976).

The album was certified gold on August 12, 1969, platinum and double platinum on November 21, 1986, and triple platinum on March 27, 2003, by the RIAA. The album was nominated for a number of Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and won Best Male Country Vocal Performance for &quot;A Boy Named Sue.&quot;

There have been several releases with different songs and set order. The album cover photo by Jim Marshall is considered to be an iconic image of Cash, with Marshall Grant&#x27;s Epiphone Newport bass guitar famously silhouetted in the foreground.

==Recording==
Johnny Cash had previously recorded a concert at a prison in 1968 at Folsom State Prison. This concert was recorded for a live LP and a television documentary for the UK. On the original LP release, the song order was changed and several songs were cut, presumably for space reasons. Despite the timing limitations of the vinyl LP format, however, both performances of the song &quot;San Quentin&quot; (Cash agreed to perform an encore at the audience&#x27;s request) are included on the original album. Early CDs that feature this and &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; on the same disc, however, contain only the second version due to time constraints. Some of the songs were censored. Despite the title of the version released on CD in 2000 – &quot;At San Quentin (The Complete 1969 Concert)&quot; – the CD does not contain the entire concert uncut, but does feature additional tracks and running order that parallels the actual setlist. Performed but not included were the songs &quot;Jackson&quot; and &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, which are included in the video release of the show (both songs had been included in &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;). Two songs were somehow slowed down by half a step (&quot;Starkville City Jail&quot; and &quot;Blistered&quot;), possibly due to using another tape machine while the tape on the original machine was changed.

This was Cash&#x27;s first album recorded without his longtime lead guitar player and Tennessee Two founder Luther Perkins, who had died several months earlier. On the album, Cash is heard paying tribute to Perkins (who was not related to Carl Perkins, who appears on the recording as lead guitarist on several tracks).

Two songs are performed live on stage for the first time during the show: &quot;San Quentin&quot; and &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the decision had already been made for Cash to perform &quot;San Quentin&quot; twice as it was considered the major new song of the set, though on record Cash makes it appear as if the encore is due to audience demand; producer Bob Johnson ultimately chose to include both versions of the song on the album. According to Hilburn, Cash spontaneously decided to perform &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; during the show and neither the TV crew nor his band knew he planned to do it (though he gave them advance warning by announcing early in the show his intent to play it); he used a lyric sheet on stage while the band improvised the backing.

==TV special and middle finger photo==
A crew from Granada Television in the UK filmed the concert for broadcast on television. In the extended version of the concert released by Columbia/Legacy in 2000, Cash is heard expressing frustration at being told what to sing and where to stand prior to his performance of &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;. The famous image of an angry-looking Cash giving the middle finger gesture to a camera originates from the performance; in his liner notes for the 2000 reissue, Cash explains that he was frustrated at having Granada&#x27;s film crew blocking his view of the audience. When the crew ignored his request to &quot;clear the stage&quot;, he made the gesture.

==Reception==

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1969, Robert Christgau said of the album, &quot;Much inferior to &quot;Folsom Prison&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which is where to start if you&#x27;re just getting into Cash. Contains only nine songs, one of which is performed twice. Another was written by Bob Dylan.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Phil Marsh wrote, &quot;Cash sounds very tired on this record (&#x27;ol&#x27; Johnny does best under pressure,&#x27; he says), his voice on some songs just straying off pitch. But the feeling that actual human communication is taking place more than compensates for this. Communicating to an audience &quot;at the time&quot; is becoming a lost art because of the ascension of recorded music as &quot;the&quot; music of this culture.&quot;

The album was nominated for a number of Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and won Best Male Country Vocal Performance for &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;.

Reviewing the 2000 Columbia/Legacy reissue, &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s Phil Sutcliffe said, &quot;Cash, just 25 , sings as old as the hills — and looks oddly Volcanic. Prisoners &#x27;have their hearts torn out,&#x27; Cash reckoned. It sounds as if he did too, wild-eyed and shuddering at the oppression of the walls. The crowd is a 1,000-strong caged animal. The reissue, with nine extra tracks, surpasses the vinyl original.&quot;

<text>The 37th Canadian Parliament was in session from January 29, 2001, until May 23, 2004. The membership was set by the 2000 federal election on November 27, 2000, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 2004 election.

It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority, led first by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and the 26th Canadian Ministry, and then by Prime Minister Paul Martin and the 27th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was formed by first the Canadian Alliance, led by Stockwell Day and then by Stephen Harper, and then by its successor party, the Conservative Party, also led by Harper.

The Speaker was Peter Milliken. See also list of Canadian electoral districts 1996-2003 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

There were three sessions of the 37th Parliament:


==Party standings==
The party standings as of the election and as of dissolution were as follows:
In 2001, 13 MPs opposed to the leadership of Stockwell Day left the Canadian Alliance and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. Chuck Strahl was chosen leader of the caucus, which subsequently entered into a coalition agreement with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In 2002, after Day had lost the leadership of his party to Stephen Harper, all but one DRC MP rejoined the Canadian Alliance.

==Bills==
Important bills of the 37th parliament include:
*&quot;Assisted Human Reproduction Act&quot;
*Canadian federal budget, 2001
*Canadian federal budget, 2003
*Canadian federal budget, 2004
*Bill C-250, declared attacks based on sexual orientation to be hate crimes.
*&quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;
*&quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;

<doc id="977717" wikidata="Q1026525" url="?curid=977717" title="Caleb B. Smith">
<text>Caleb Blood Smith (April 16, 1808 – January 7, 1864) was a United States Representative from Indiana, the 6th United States Secretary of the Interior and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Indiana.

==Education and career==
Born on April 16, 1808, in Boston, Massachusetts, Smith moved with his parents to Ohio in 1814. He attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, from 1825 to 1826, Cincinnati College (now the University of Cincinnati) and read law in 1828. He entered private practice in Connersville, Fayette County, Indiana, from 1828 to 1843. He was founder and editor of the &quot;Indiana Sentinel&quot; in 1832. He was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1832 to 1837, and from 1840 to 1841, serving as Speaker in 1836. He was Commissioner to collect assets and adjust debts for Indiana in 1837.

==Congressional service==

Smith was an unsuccessful candidate for the 27th United States Congress in 1841. He was elected as a Whig from Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 28th, 29th and 30th United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1849. He was Chairman of the Committee on Territories for the 30th United States Congress.

==Later career==

Smith was appointed by President Zachary Taylor to serve as a member of the board of commissioners to adjust claims against Mexico from 1849 to 1851. He resumed private practice in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1851 to 1859. He was a member of the Peace Convention of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending American Civil War. He was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to serve as the 6th United States Secretary of the Interior from March 5, 1861, to January 1, 1863. However, Smith had little interest in the job and, with declining health, delegated most of his responsibilities to Assistant Secretary of the Interior John Palmer Usher. When Lincoln showed the draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet, the conservative Smith considered resignation upon its public announcement, but accepted the decision in the end.

==Federal judicial service==

Smith was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln on December 16, 1862, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Indiana vacated by Judge Elisha Mills Huntington. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 22, 1862, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on January 7, 1864, due to his death in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. It is unknown where Smith is buried. The reason for this is that Smith&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth was terrified his body would be desecrated as the southerners were coming from south to north desecrating bodies in graves. He was first buried at Greenlawn cemetery but later moved by his wife to be put in Crown Hill Cemetery, when they opened up in Indianapolis. There is a mausoleum at Crown Hill in Indianapolis but Smith is not buried there.

SEARCH FOR SMITH&#x27;S BODY

An investigation into this and opening of mausoleum in 1977 proved that Smith was not there only his wife and child. In 1977 an excavation in the Connersville City Cemetery in Indiana in the Smith-Watton lot was carried out with permission from family members to locate Smith&#x27;s body. Smith was also not found there.

It has been said that Caleb B. Smith&#x27;s body is buried in a Connersville, Indiana cemetery. In 1977, John Walker, a Connersville, Indiana resident, received permission from the Smith family, Norvella Thomas Copes, and Nancy S. Hurley, and the city of Connersville, Indiana, to excavate the body of Caleb Blood Smith. Walker had an interest in President Abraham Lincoln, and discovered in reading about Lincoln that one of his cabinet members was buried in the city he lived in. An excavation was carried out in the Smith-Watton lot in November 1977, but Smith&#x27;s body was not there. It was Smith&#x27;s son-in-law William Watton Smith that was found. C.B. Smith&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth B. Watton, had paid $500 for the choice of plots, in Crownhill Cemetery[1] and moved the body from Greenlawn Cemetery to Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis for fear of southern dissenters, the Sons of Liberty, desecrating his body and of local teens knocking over the markers in Greenlawn. A letter inquiring about the whereabouts of Smith&#x27;s body found in the 1980s arose from a New York public library in the 1930s.

The letter was written April 24, 1936 by Louis J. Bailey, Chief Librarian of the Queens Borough Public Library in New York and sent a letter to a Miss Dunn, a librarian in Connersville, In. He inquired to Miss Dunn in regards to the location of Smith&#x27;s body. In that letter he states that He enclosed a letter from Senator New about Smith to her. Louis talks of records saved in the Indiana Library from Green Lawn Cemetery, where C.B.Smith was originally buried,(because Crown Hill cemetery had not yet opened) and discusses possible locations, misspellings of the Watton name. (Walton and Watton). Caleb Smiths wife was Elizabeth Watton, but few have it listed as Walton. The correct spelling is WATTON. 
Lincoln Memorial University has also inquired about the location of Smiths&#x27; body, in a letter to my grandfather, John Walker.

A 55-page research paper by John Walker on Smith reveals evidence that was discovered in 2009 listing names of those who have researched and written their findings on Caleb Smith. Offering possibilities of his being buried in someone else&#x27;s grave, secret midnight burials, curses, and other findings, this paper has much to offer in the way of newspaper articles, letters, and family tales of where he is buried.

==Freemason==
Smith became a Freemason in Warren Lodge No. 15 at Connersville in 1829. He would go on to serve as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Indiana in 1837. Today, the highest award presented by the Grand Lodge of Indiana is the Caleb B. Smith Medal of Honor. Today Smith&#x27;s former home, Also known as Elmhurst in Connersville Indiana is the home of the Connersville Masonic Lodge #15 that went into operation in 1940. Smith&#x27;s former home is on the national register of Historic Homes.

<text>Ludovic Navarre (, born 10 April 1969), known by his stage name St Germain, is a French DJ and musical artist. His style has been described as a combination of house music and nu jazz music.

==Career==
Navarre&#x27;s album &quot;Boulevard&quot; was released in July 1995 and has sold over one million copies worldwide. His United States debut, &quot;Tourist&quot;, was released in 2000 and sold 300,000 copies in the USA and four million copies worldwide. Bob Marley, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Miles Davis and Kool and the Gang are among Ludovic&#x27;s early influences. He composed his first work under the name of Sub System with friend Guy Rabiller. He has released EPs under a number of aliases, among them Deepside, LN&#x27;S, Modus Vivendi, Nuages and Soofle.

St Germain is not associated with the Saint-Germain-des-Prés Café compilation series, though his song &quot;Deep in It&quot; is featured on its &quot;Volume 1&quot;.

His song &quot;Rose Rouge&quot; was featured in the official movie trailer for Joss Whedon&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

His eponymous album, released on 9 October 2015, was recorded with the participation of African musicians, the album features traditional Malian instruments such as kora, balafon and ngoni, that mingle with electric guitars, pianos, saxophones and electronic loops. The first single, “Real Blues”, sets the voice of Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins to the beat of wild, fiery drums and percussion.

The original single sleeve is decorated with a 3D mask conceived by Urban Art creator Gregos, known for his smiling and frowning faces stuck on walls throughout Paris and Europe.

St Germain was included in the line-up for Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival 2016.

<doc id="977722" wikidata="Q7075483" url="?curid=977722" title="Observer Badge">
<text>The Observer Badge is a military badge of the United States armed forces dating from the First World War. The badge was issued to co-pilots, navigators, and flight support personnel (as air observer) who had received a variation in the training required for the standard Pilot&#x27;s Badge. The Observer Badge survived through the Second World War and into the 1950s, at which time the concept of an Observer Badge was phased out in favor of the modern Aircrew Badge and Navigator-Observer Badges. In addition to wings for Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers, the United States Navy still maintains an &quot;Observer Badge&quot; which is issued to flight-qualified mission specialists, such as a select number of meteorologists and intelligence officers in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. Air Force awards its USAF Observer Badge, which is identical to the USAF Navigator Badge, to Air Force officers who have qualified as NASA Space Shuttle Mission Specialists, have flown an actual mission aboard the shuttle and/or the International Space Station and who are otherwise not previously aeronautically rated as an Air Force pilot or navigator.

In the modern U.S. Armed Forces, the Observer Badge is rarely issued, but has seen a resurgence in the Air Forces of other countries, most notably the United Kingdom and Canada.

==First World War==

The original Observer Badge was a half-wing variation of the Aviator Badge worn by military pilots of the United States Army Air Service and later the United States Army Air Corps. The badge was mainly awarded to gunners, spotters, and navigators on the first armed military aircraft. With the advent of bombing, the Observer Badge was also initially authorized for aircraft bombardiers. A new badge was soon created for these duties, however: the Bombing Aviator Badge.

Those rated as Balloon Observers were also eligible for the badge, and the badge was typically referred to as both the &quot;Airplane Observer Badge&quot; and the &quot;Balloon Observer Badge&quot;. The design of the badge awarded was identical in both cases, and towards the end of the First World War was commonly referred to as the &quot;Airplane and Balloon Observer Badge&quot;, although the ratings for which the badge was issued remained distinct.

==Second World War==

Between 1919 and 1935 the design of the Observer Badge remained unchanged, and was issued to both airplane and lighter-than-air ratings. However, as military aviation developed, changes in the concept of an Airplane Observer necessitated the redesign of the Observer Badge with a corresponding change in the eligibility criteria. On 20 February 1940 the rating was changed to that of &quot;Combat Observer&quot;, followed by redesignation as &quot;Aircraft Observer&quot; on 4 September 1942. Note that bombardiers that used the top secret SHORAN also received the Observer Badge. They sat midship, where the radio operator would normally sit, since they used an electronic not optical bombsight.

By the time of the United States&#x27; entry into the Second World War, three Observer Badges were authorized by the Army Air Forces. The first was the Combat Observer Badge: in appearance an Aviator Badge with a large &#x27;O&#x27; in the center. For Balloon Observers, a separate badge was created: the Observer Badge augmented with a balloon insignia.

The third and final version of the Observer Badge was the Technical Observer Badge, an Aviator Badge with a T and O motif in the center. The Technical Observer Badge was primarily awarded to flight engineering personnel assigned to assist the flight engineer.

==United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard==

The Naval Aviation Observer Badge was first created in 1922, awarded to navigators and other support personnel on naval aircraft. The original badge was based on the design of the Naval Aviator badge, but with a single wing on the left, and with the anchor surmounted by an &quot;O&quot; rather than a shield. In 1927 this insignia was superseded by a new device, identical to the Naval Aviator&#x27;s wings, but in silver rather than gold.

This in turn was replaced by a gold insignia with a center device of a silver anchor within a silver circle, used from 1929 to 1968.
For a brief period starting in 1945, the Secretary of the Navy approved distinct insignia for Naval Aviation Observers with Navigation, Radar, Tactical, and Aerology specializations. These were abolished in favor of the standardized gold insignia/silver anchor/silver circle design.

In 1966 a new insignia was instituted, and by 1968 the Naval Aviation Observer Badge was replaced by the Naval Flight Officer Badge. However, in lieu of being totally discontinued, the criteria for the Naval Aviation Observer insignia was modified again and granted to non-pilot/non-NFO aviation mission specialists such as in-flight Meteorologists or for Naval Intelligence or Cryptology officers who regularly fly as crew on selected naval aircraft. In this form the Naval Observer Badge is still in existence, but is alternatingly referred to by both its original name and, in the case of when worn by Meteorology officers, as the Flight Meteorologist Badge. In the Marine Corps the badge is awarded to in-flight aircraft support personnel under its original name as the Naval Aviation Observer Badge for non-aeronautically designated officers flying in observer/spotter roles in Marine Corps aircraft.

The Coast Guard authorized the Aviation Mission Specialist designation on August 26, 2003 in COMDTNOTE 1200 (ALCOAST 401/03). Aerial Ice Observers (from the International Ice Patrol) as well as Sensor System Operators, Tactical Systems Operators, Aviation Gunners and Aviation Medical Technicians are eligible for designation. Coast Guard Aviation Mission Specialist personnel also wear the same uniform insignia as Naval Aviation Observers. Permanent designation is attained at 200 hours for rotary wing and 400 hours for fixed wing specialists.

==US Air Force Observer rating==

With the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, aviation observers were phased out and replaced by more highly trained specialists known as Aircrew personnel. The Aircrew Badge was created prior to the Second World War; but had only been awarded to enlisted personnel. Since the creation of the USAF Officer Aircrew Badge (an unrated award), the Navigator-Observer Badge has been issued to otherwise unrated officers who complete NASA Mission Specialist training with the aeronautical rating of Observer. On completion of an operational mission they may then apply to the Air Force Chief of Staff for the Astronaut qualification that permits them to wear the USAF Navigator / Combat Systems Officer version of the Astronaut Badge.

===Civil Air Patrol===

The title &quot;Observer&quot; is still used regularly in the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary, better known as the Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol observers may act as the mission commander for aircrews engaged in search and rescue, homeland defense reconnaissance, or other Air Force-authorized missions, serving as the liaison between the sortie and mission base. Observers are trained in air navigation, radio communications, and other technical subjects such as aerial direction finding. The Civil Air Patrol badge for an observer looks almost identical to the CAP pilot badge, except that the observer device has an additional &quot;O&quot; or thin circle atop the central CAP emblem.

<text>In mathematics, a semi-local ring is a ring for which &quot;R&quot;/J(&quot;R&quot;) is a semisimple ring, where J(&quot;R&quot;) is the Jacobson radical of &quot;R&quot;. 

The above definition is satisfied if &quot;R&quot; has a finite number of maximal right ideals (and finite number of maximal left ideals). When &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring, the converse implication is also true, and so the definition of semi-local for commutative rings is often taken to be &quot;having finitely many maximal ideals&quot;.

Some literature refers to a commutative semi-local ring in general as a
&quot;quasi-semi-local ring&quot;, using semi-local ring to refer to a Noetherian ring with finitely many maximal ideals.

A semi-local ring is thus more general than a local ring, which has only one maximal (right/left/two-sided) ideal.

== Examples ==
* Any right or left Artinian ring, any serial ring, and any semiperfect ring is semi-local. 
* The quotient formula_1 is a semi-local ring. In particular, if formula_2 is a prime power, then formula_1 is a local ring.
* A finite direct sum of fields formula_4 is a semi-local ring. 
* In the case of commutative rings with unity, this example is prototypical in the following sense: the Chinese remainder theorem shows that for a semi-local commutative ring &quot;R&quot; with unit and maximal ideals &quot;m&quot;1, ..., &quot;mn&quot;
:formula_5.
:(The map is the natural projection). The right hand side is a direct sum of fields. Here we note that ∩i mi=J(&quot;R&quot;), and we see that &quot;R&quot;/J(&quot;R&quot;) is indeed a semisimple ring.
* The classical ring of quotients for any commutative Noetherian ring is a semilocal ring.
* The endomorphism ring of an Artinian module is a semilocal ring.
* Semi-local rings occur for example in algebraic geometry when a (commutative) ring &quot;R&quot; is localized with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset &quot;S = ∩ (R \ pi)&quot;, where the &quot;pi&quot; are finitely many prime ideals.

<doc id="977729" wikidata="Q7707936" url="?curid=977729" title="Texas Regulars">
<text>The Texas Regulars was a group based in Texas which was formed in 1944 to deny Franklin D. Roosevelt a majority of the Electoral College in the 1944 presidential election.

== Background ==

By the 1940s, conservative Democrats in Texas had become increasingly disenchanted with Roosevelt and his New Deal.

They were also unhappy that the US Supreme Court, in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944), had disallowed the segregated primaries used by the Democratic Party in Texas and some other states.

== History ==

=== Attempt at taking over the Texas Democratic Party ===
The Texas Regulars tried to gain control of the state nominating convention and select a slate of presidential electors who would not vote for Roosevelt. The group&#x27;s supporters included US Representative Martin Dies Jr., former Texas governor Dan Moody, and Senator W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel.

The Texas Regulars won the first convention, but lost the second convention.

=== Unpledged electors ===
This defeat led them to form their own ticket of unpledged electors, not bound to any candidate. On election day, they finished third both in Texas and in the national popular vote, with 135,439 votes (0.3% of the vote nationally, and 11.8% of the vote in Texas). They won a majority in only Washington County, Texas.

Roosevelt easily carried Texas with 71.4% of the statewide vote, and won national re-election with 432 of 531 electoral votes.

=== Platform ===
The Texas Regulars opposed the New Deal, trade unions, and government intervention and supported states&#x27; rights and white supremacy, with a platform paraphrased as follows:
# Restoration of the Democratic Party to the integrity which has been taken away by Hillman, Browder, and others.
# Protection of honest labor unions from foreign-born racketeers who have gained control by blackmail.
# Return of state rights which have been destroyed by the Communist-controlled New Deal.
# Restoration of the freedom of education.
# Restoration of the supremacy of the white race, which has been destroyed by the Communist-controlled New Deal.
# Restoration of the Bill of Rights instead of rule by regimentation.
# Restoration of government by laws instead of government by bureaus. 
# Restoration of the individual appeal for justice, instead of a politically appointed bureau.

==Aftermath==
The Texas Regulars disbanded soon afterward, but many of them went on to support the Dixiecrat movement of Strom Thurmond in the 1948 presidential election.

They later became &quot;Eisenhower Democrats&quot; (or supported unpledged electors in presidential elections) in the 1950s, before becoming Republicans by the 1960s and 1970s.

<doc id="977735" wikidata="Q559592" url="?curid=977735" title="Donie Cassidy">
<text>Daniel &quot;Donie&quot; Cassidy (born 15 September 1945) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Leader of the Seanad from 2007 to 2011. He served as a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1982 to 2002 and 2007 to 2011 and a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Westmeath constituency from 2002 to 2007.

==Early and personal life==
Cassidy was born in Castlepollard in County Westmeath. He came to prominence in Ireland through the show band scene. A saxophone player with Jim Tobin and the Firehouse, he moved into showbusiness management. He was the manager of Foster and Allen, a popular singing duo that enjoyed success inside and outside Ireland.

==Political career==
He first held political office in 1982 when he was elected as a Fianna Fáil Senator for the Labour Panel. He was a member of Westmeath County Council from 1985 until 2003 at which point he resigned from the council due to the abolition of the dual mandate.

Cassidy was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Westmeath constituency at the 2002 general election, taking the seat of sitting TD and Government Minister Mary O&#x27;Rourke. This created a rift between the two politicians and Cassidy lost his seat to O&#x27;Rourke at the 2007 general election when both candidates contested the Longford–Westmeath constituency. The fact that Cassidy lost most of his home base of Castlepollard and north Westmeath due to the redrawing of the constituency did not help him. On 22 June 2007, Cassidy was nominated by the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to Seanad Éireann and was appointed Leader of the Seanad for the remaining weeks of the 22nd Seanad&#x27;s existence. Cassidy was subsequently elected to the Labour Panel at the 2007 Seanad general election and was Leader of the Seanad until March 2011. He lost his seat at the 2011 Seanad election.

===Golfgate===
Cassidy was President of the Oireachtas Golf Society during the &quot;GolfGate&quot; controversy in August 2020, in which 81 prominent figures attended a dinner in Clifden, County Galway during COVID-19 restrictions.

Cassidy resigned on 23 August 2020 as vice president of Fianna Fáil following criticism of his arranging of the event. In a statement, he said: &quot;In light of the ongoing controversy surrounding the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden, and due to the fact that the matter is subject to a garda investigation, I tendered my resignation as Leas Úachtaráin of Fianna Fáil to Sean Dorgan General Secretary yesterday.&quot;

In February 2021, it was announced by the Garda Síochána that Cassidy is to face charges over alleged breaches of COVID-19 regulations by arranging by golf dinner. On 3 February 2022, Cassidy and his co-defendants were acquitted of all charges they faced. The Court concluded: “They were all responsible people who would not have gone to a dinner unless they felt comfortable and unless the organisers had not put in place all that was required to make it safe. I’m satisfied the organisers did everything to comply - not in a court of public opinion - but in the court of law in my opinion. Unfortunately, very good people lost very good jobs and very good contracts and just to clarify, I didn’t make my decision based on that.&quot; Grealish said he was &quot;delighted with the outcome&quot;. Done Cassidy, described as being emotional when leaving the court,said he was always a lawmaker and never a law-breaker.

==Business interests==

Cassidy owns four hotels, including one on the former site of the National Wax Museum as well as The Belvedere Hotel on Great Denmark Street. He also owns Celtic Note, a specialist Irish music store on Dublin&#x27;s Nassau Street and since 1984 has had the franchise to sell CDs and DVDs at Dublin Airport. He also owns several buildings in Mullingar. His other interests include record and music publishing companies. He owns the publishing rights to many well known songs such as &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;My Lovely Rose of Clare&quot;.

<text>Trey Gunn (born December 13, 1960) is an American musician, known for being in the progressive rock band King Crimson from 1994 to 2003. He plays Warr Guitar and Chapman Stick instruments.

==Biography==
A native Texan who now resides in New Mexico, Gunn began playing classical piano when he was 7. He has also played electric bass, electric and acoustic guitar, keyboards, and the touch guitar. He moved to Eugene, Oregon and played in punk bands while earning a degree in classical music composition at the University of Oregon. Next, he moved to New York City and began a professional career in music.

For a while he was a student of Guitar Craft with founder Robert Fripp and appeared on several Robert Fripp as well as the League of Crafty Guitarists recordings. From 1988 to 1991, he toured playing a Chapman Stick in the UK and Europe, with Toyah Willcox, Robert Fripp, and Paul Beavis. 

At first he played under the band project name &quot;Fripp, Fripp&quot; who by the second tour became Sunday All Over the World. They recorded and released an album in 1991 entitled &quot;Kneeling at the Shrine&quot;. In the same year and with the SAOTW lineup, he also played stick on the solo Toyah album &quot;Ophelia&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, produced by Toyah who was to later guest on his album, &quot;The Third Star&quot;. In 1992, Gunn was asked to join David Sylvian and Robert Fripp in a collaborative project that toured the United States, Europe, and Japan. The band released &quot;The First Day&quot; and &quot;Damage&quot;–a live recording from the Royal Albert Hall in London. During that period, Gunn also recorded his first solo album &quot;One Thousand Years&quot;.

In 1992 and 1993 with Fripp, Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya, and Paul Richards, he toured and recorded as The Robert Fripp String Quintet.

In 1994, Gunn joined King Crimson. With King Crimson he played a Chapman Stick and later diverse types of Warr guitar. He was part of the &quot;double trio&quot; formation opposite Tony Levin. In 1997, King Crimson fragmented into smaller configurations known as the ProjeKcts. Gunn, along with Fripp, participated in all of the ProjeKcts performances and recordings. In 1999, the group mutated into a four-piece–Belew, Fripp, Gunn, and Mastelotto. He left Crimson after &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; tour in 2003. Over the course of a decade with the group, he participated in thirty-three King Crimson CDs, two DVDs, and hundreds of performances. 

He has also performed and recorded with a number of other musicians: Tool, Puscifer, Brian Eno, Robert Fripp, Sean Malone and Gordian Knot, David Sylvian, Vernon Reid, John Paul Jones, Eric Johnson, Jerry Marotta, Alice, Azam Ali, Matt Chamberlain, Michael Brook, Bill Rieflin, David Hykes of the Harmonic Choir and many more. He has released a number of solo albums, as Trey Gunn and as the leader of The Trey Gunn Band.

Years of working with broad-necked instruments like the Warr guitar affected Gunn physically. He has had to seek less damaging playing methods expressing his art. As a result he has been playing the guitar in a horizontal position across his lap. He also has earned a black belt in Aikido from &quot;Bruce Bookman&quot; and practices Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu brown belt in Santa Fe, NM.

In 2003, Gunn founded the multi-media group &quot;Quodia&quot; with Joe Mendelson where he has contributed more vocals than in previous projects and less Warr guitar. In 2004, he and Pat Mastelotto started collaborating with Kimmo Pohjonen and Samuli Kosminen, forming KTU out of their respective duos, TU and Kluster. In 2012, he began working with Jerry Marotta in the group The Security Project.

In addition to helping run the label &quot;7d Media&quot;, he currently works as a solo artist, in film and television scoring, coaching artists in the creative process at &quot;Original Voice Coaching&quot;, and as a member of the group Tu-Ner with Pat Mastelotto and Markus Reuter.

<text>James Donald (18 May 1917 – 3 August 1993) was a Scottish actor. Tall and thin, he specialised in playing authority figures, particularly military doctors.

==Early life==
Donald was born in Aberdeen, the fourth son of a Scottish Presbyterian minister. His mother died when he was 18 months old and his father remarried.

Donald grew up in Galashiels and was educated at Rossall School on Lancashire&#x27;s Fylde coast. He briefly attended McGill University in Montreal but, due to asthma, he transferred to the University of Edinburgh.

Donald originally intended to be a teacher, but seeing Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Dame Edith Evans in &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot; made him decide to be an actor. He began seeing as many shows as possible and studied at the London Theatre Studio for two years. He made his stage debut in 1938 in &quot;The White Guard&quot; and he began to get work regularly on stage. He appeared in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Michael Redgrave and understudied John Gielgud in &quot;King Lear&quot;. He toured the provinces in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;.

==War service==
In 1939, Donald tried to enlist but a medical classified him as unfit for military service so he joined ENSA. He played minor roles in several war films, including &quot;Alibi&quot; (1942), &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942), &quot;San Demetrio London&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944). He achieved fame on stage appearing in &quot;Present Laughter&quot; by Noël Coward. In 1943 he was signed by MGM.

After &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; in 1944, the British Army reversed its earlier decision and called up Donald. He joined the RASC before being assigned to British Army Intelligence where he typed up decoded enemy messages.

==Acting career==
After the war he resumed his acting career. On stage he was in &quot;The Eagle with Two Heads&quot; (1947) and &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1948) In films, MGM loaned him to Gainsborough Studios for &quot;Broken Journey&quot; (1948). He was also in &quot;The Small Voice&quot; (1948) and MGM&#x27;s &quot;Edward, My Son&quot; (1949).

Donald had great success on stage in &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949) with Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft and Donald Sinden. It led to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s casting him in a production of &quot;Captain Caravallo&quot; (1950).

For films, he was Jean Kent&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Trottie True&quot; (1949) and supported Jean Simmons in &quot;Cage of Gold&quot; (1950) and Googie Withers in &quot;White Corridors&quot; (1951).

Donald had the lead in a comedy &quot;Brandy for the Parson&quot; (1952) and supported Trevor Howard and Richard Attenborough in &quot;Gift Horse&quot; (1952). He played Mr Winkle in the 1952 film version of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

He had the lead in &quot;The Net&quot; (1953) and was cast in his first Hollywood film in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Beau Brummell&quot; (1954). The same studio hired him to play Theo Van Gogh in &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956). It was Donald&#x27;s voice that read aloud the famous letters from the artist, played by Kirk Douglas, to his brother, which formed the narrative backbone of the film.

===International work===
He portrayed Major Clipton, the doctor who expresses grave doubts about the sanity of Colonel Nicholson&#x27;s (Alec Guinness) efforts to build the bridge in order to show up his Japanese captors, in the war film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957). He spoke the film&#x27;s final words: &quot;Madness! Madness!&quot;

Donald was in much demand to play supporting roles in action and prisoner-of-war films: &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958); &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot; (1959); Group Captain Ramsey, the Senior British Officer in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963); &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), a doctor in a POW camp; and &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; (1966). He played a colonel in a comedy &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967) and had a part as a heroic scientist in &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967).

Donald starred in a 1960 television adaptation of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Citadel&quot; and appeared regularly in many other television dramas in the UK and US. He starred in two episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; directed by Hitchcock himself: &quot;Poison&quot; (from the story by Roald Dahl) and &quot;The Crystal Trench&quot; (based on the story by A.E.W. Mason). In 1961, he played Prince Albert opposite Julie Harris&#x27;s Queen Victoria, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production of Laurence Housman&#x27;s play &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, for which he received an Emmy nomination.

He performed &quot;Write Me a Murder&quot; (1961) on Broadway.

==Later life==
Later film roles included &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969), &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (1969), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1969), &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978).

==Death==
Donald retired from acting in part because of a lifelong asthmatic condition. He grew grapes and made wine on his farm in Hampshire. He died of stomach cancer on 3 August 1993 in West Tytherley, Hampshire. He was survived by his wife Ann, and a stepson.

<text>The Pacific Clipper (civil registration NC18602) was an American Boeing 314 Clipper flying boat, famous for having completed an unplanned nearly around-the-world flight in December 1941 and January 1942 as the California Clipper. Aviation experts called the flight the first commercial circumnavigation of the globe because the aircraft made it back to its country of origin.

==History==
The Boeing 314 with civil registration NC18602 was delivered to Pan American; it made its shakedown flight from San Francisco, United States to Hong Kong from February 23 to March 3, 1939.

==Flight==

On December 2, 1941, the Clipper departed from the Pan American base on Treasure Island, San Francisco for its scheduled passenger service to Auckland, New Zealand. It landed at Pan American&#x27;s LaGuardia Field seaplane base in New York City five weeks later, at 7:12 on the morning of January 6, 1942.

===Crew===
*Captain Robert Ford
*First Officer John H. Mack
*Second Officer/Navigator Roderick N. Brown
*Third Officer James G. Henriksen
*Fourth Officer John D. Steers
*First Engineer Homans K. &quot;Swede&quot; Roth
*Second Engineer John B. &quot;Jocko&quot; Parish
*First Radio Officer John Poindexter*
*Second Radio Officer Oscar Hendrickson
*Radio Operator Edward Leach**
*Purser Barney Sawicki
*Asst Purser Verne C. Edwards

 Poindexter departed Treasure Island, California as an observer tasked with validating the performance of a new radio set; for that leg of the journey, Hendrickson was first radio officer and the second radio officer position was vacant. Upon arrival in San Pedro, California, Captain Ford learned that the man who was supposed in serve as second radio officer was hospitalized and Poindexter, who was senior to Hendrickson, agreed to continue on the trans-Pacific journey, becoming the first radio officer.

Leach was a staff passenger, originally being transported from Nouméa, New Caledonia to Auckland, New Zealand. After boarding in Nouméa, Leach remained with the aircraft until its arrival in New York.

===Scheduled points===
#San Pedro, California, United States on December 2, 1941, where the designated second radio officer was scheduled to join the crew; Ford learned that the man had been hospitalized. When informed of the need, Poindexter agreed to continue the flight.
#Honolulu, Hawaii for crew rest.
#Canton Island for fuel.
#Suva, Fiji for fuel.
#Nouméa, New Caledonia for fuel.
#Auckland, New Zealand for termination and return to California. When the aircraft was between Nouméa and Auckland, Ford learned of the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. He opened his instructions labelled &quot;Plan A&quot; and learned that he was to land at Auckland and await further instructions.

===Extended points===

#Auckland: Ford received a message from Flight Operations of Pan American to not return through the war zone but to strip all external identification from his aircraft and to proceed westward as soon as his judgment allowed and return to LaGuardia Field in New York. The plan designed by Ford and his officers was to begin by flying to Sydney, Australia. While preparing for departure, Ford received additional instructions to return to Nouméa and evacuate all Pan American personnel and their families to Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. Ford ordered his crew to suspend stripping the markings from the fuselage and to disassemble two spare engines and to load them onto NC18602 as insurance. The aircraft departed for New Caledonia in the dark.
#Nouméa: The aircraft landed at Pan American&#x27;s Nouméa base early in the morning of December 16, 1941. Airline operations had ordered that an additional engine, in a crate, be transported to Karachi, British India. The crew loaded the engine, took on the airline employees and their families, and left for Gladstone later on December 16
#Gladstone: NC18602 arrived in Gladstone the same day. Ford was disappointed to learn that no 100 octane aviation fuel was available. At Gladstone, First Engineer Rothe recommended that Ford ask two aircraft mechanics who had been assigned to Nouméa to stay with the aircraft until it arrived in New York. Ford offered the mechanics flight pay if they would continue; both agreed. The ground manager at Gladstone managed to find $500 (U.S.) for Ford so the captain would be able to buy supplies.
#Darwin, Australia: Ford was able to acquire aviation fuel in Darwin but it was stored in cans and had to be manually transferred to the tanks of the aircraft; that task was completed early in the morning of December 18, 1941. Ford taxied into the channel and took off, bound for Surabaya, Netherlands East Indies as the Sun rose.
#Surabaya: NC18602 was intercepted by aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Force, which followed the aircraft until Ford landed in a nonthreatening manner. The base had an insufficient supply of aviation fuel to provide the 100 octane product but was able to provide 76 octane automobile gasoline. While the Pan American aircraft was at Surabaya, the surviving aircraft of a U.S. Navy PBY squadron from the Philippines arrived. Before leaving Surabaya, the crew was immunized against typhus, dysentery, and cholera. Ford took off from Surabaya burning their usual 100 octane and switched to the 76 octane after reaching cruising altitude. The engines backfired but kept running. NC18602 proceeded to Trincomalee, Ceylon.
#Trincomalee: On the way to Trincomalee on December 21, 1941, Ford ordered a descent from the cloud cover to determine the aircraft&#x27;s location. The crew members saw a Japanese submarine on the surface and Ford ascended to avoid being shot down. At least one round was fired by the submarine but missed the aircraft. Upon arrival in Trincomalee, Ford reported sighting the submarine but the British air wing commander did not believe him. Ford and his crew departed Trincomalee on December 21, 1941, but an engine problem forced him to return to the base in Ceylon. They departed for Karachi, British India on December 26.
#Karachi: Upon arrival, Ford unloaded the boxed engine that he had been ordered to transport from Nouméa. He also learned that Pan American had ordered one of the two mechanics that had been aboard since Nouméa to remain in Karachi to help establish a maintenance base. Ford&#x27;s flight engineers told him the variable pitch controller that controlled feathering propellers on one engine was faulty; repair would require at least one day. The base in Karachi did have aviation fuel and Ford was able to refuel with the 100 octane product. After all the tasks were completed, NC18602 departed Karachi early in the morning of December 28.
#Bahrain: Arriving approximately eight hours after leaving Karachi, Ford was told by the local military commander that only 76 octane fuel was available. He also received instructions to leave the remaining mechanic in Bahrain. When Ford filed his flight plan to his next stop in Khartoum, the British dispatcher told him that his plan took him over the holy city of Mecca, that Saudi Arabians objected to flights over that city, and that he would have to fly north to Kuwait before turning west. Ford agreed, filed an amended plan, and departed in the morning of December 29, 1941. After leaving Bahrain, Ford found sufficient cloud cover and turned west, overflying Mecca enroute to Khartoum.
#Khartoum, Sudan: Ford successfully landed NC18602 on the Nile River on December 29, 1941, where there was no wharf, and went ashore to confer with the British commander. That commander told him he was being asked to wait until a very important person arrived on a BOAC flight and who required transportation to Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. Ford reluctantly agreed and wait. He did find that 100 octane fuel was available. The &quot;VIP&quot; was revealed to be the wife of a minor British official who had inveigled her way onto a VIP list; she was never identified. During takeoff on January 1, 1942, a portion of the exhaust stack on one of the engines dislodged, producing noise and smoke; Ford decided the risk was acceptable and proceeded to Léopoldville.
#Léopoldville: Upon landing at the Pan American base, Ford and his crew prepared for the longest leg of their journey, mostly over water of 3100 nautical miles. Taking off required moving downriver toward the Congo Gorges. Ford managed to get NC18602 into the air while dangerously overheating the aircraft&#x27;s engines. Once airborne, Ford and his crew headed west toward Natal, Brazil. During the flight, which lasted almost 48 hours, Ford used a portion of his fuel reserve because he had to navigate around weather systems. NC18602 landed without incident in Natal.
#Natal: Upon landing, Ford was told by the base manager that his arrival was expected. Ford&#x27;s crew was well rested and Ford wanted to refuel and to depart for Port of Spain as soon as possible. The manager told him that refueling could be quickly completed but added that new health regulations required that the interior of the aircraft be sprayed for mosquitoes to control an outbreak of yellow fever and remained sealed for one hour. The flight engineers attempted a repair of the exhaust stack. After takeoff from Natal, the exhaust stack repair failed and the crew learned that the safe on the flight deck had been opened and papers and money had been taken. The assessment was that the exterminators were spies and had taken the objects; this was never confirmed.
#Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago: The crew got some needed rest after landing. Pan American mechanics completed a repair that lasted on the exhaust stack. In the afternoon of January 5, 1942, NC18602 took off for the final leg of its journey to New York.
#New York: NC18602 arrived in New York before dawn on January 6, 1942. The aircraft was required to remain aloft until the sky was light enough for them to safely use the seaplane channel. After landing, the aircraft struck a sandbar while taxiing; it was undamaged.

Ford and his crew successfully flew over from Auckland to New York.

===Post-mission debriefings===
Ford was debriefed by the Chief of Naval Operations. He reported spotting the Japanese submarine near Sri Lanka and his encounter with the crews of the Navy PBYs.

==Aftermath==
After the aircraft had completed its harrowing flight to safety, Pan American renamed the aircraft the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot;. The name change was mainly for publicity purposes, arising from the first newspaper articles having wrongly identified the aircraft.

On 30/31 January 1942, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; transported Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles from the Pan-American emergency defense conference at Rio de Janeiro to Miami, covering the 4,350 miles in a record 33 hours. The black and grey camouflaged ship carried 39 passengers.

After the war, in 1946, it was sold to Universal Airlines but was damaged in a storm and ultimately salvaged for parts in 1951.

==Aircraft identification==
It has been suggested that two aircraft might have been involved in the extended flight: NC18606 from California to Hawaii and NC18602 from Hawaii to New York. However, records indicate the only two B314s were in the Pacific when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. NC18602 was enroute to Auckland from Pearl. NC18611 was inbound to Pearl Harbor with about an hour of flight time remaining; it diverted to Hilo, Hawaii and returned to California after dark.

An article in the Chicago Tribune placed two other clippers in the Pacific in December 1941, identifying them as the Hong Kong Clipper and the Philippine Clipper. The Hong Kong Clipper may have been a Sikorsky S-42 registered as NC16735; the Philippine Clipper may have been a Martin M-130 registered as NC14715.

<doc id="977752" wikidata="Q901674" url="?curid=977752" title="Amniotic fluid">
<text>The amniotic fluid is the protective liquid contained by the amniotic sac of a gravid amniote. This fluid serves as a cushion for the growing fetus, but also serves to facilitate the exchange of nutrients, water, and biochemical products between mother and fetus.

For humans, the amniotic fluid is commonly called water or waters (Latin liquor amnii).

== Development==

Amniotic fluid is present from the formation of the gestational sac. Amniotic fluid is in the amniotic sac. It is generated from maternal plasma, and passes through the fetal membranes by osmotic and hydrostatic forces. When fetal kidneys begin to function around week 16, fetal urine also contributes to the fluid. In earlier times, it was believed that the amniotic fluid was composed entirely of excreted fetal urine.

The fluid is absorbed through the fetal tissue and skin. After 22 to 25 week of pregnancy, keratinization of an embryo&#x27;s skin occurs. When this process completes around the 25th week, the fluid is primarily absorbed by the fetal gut for the remainder of gestation.

===Contents===
At first, amniotic fluid is mainly water with electrolytes, but by about the 12–14th week the liquid also contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and phospholipids, urea, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components including collagens and glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, all of which aid in the growth of the fetus.

===Volume===
The volume of amniotic fluid changes with the growth of fetus. From the tenth to the 20th week it increases from approximately. Approximately in the 10th–11th week, the breathing and swallowing of the fetus slightly decrease the amount of fluid. Neither urination nor swallowing contributes significantly to fluid quantity changes until the 25th week when keratinization of skin is complete; then the relationship between fluid and fetal growth stops. It reaches a plateau of by the 28-week gestational age. The amount of fluid declines to roughly at 42 weeks. Some sources indicate about of amniotic fluid is present at birth.

===Rupture of membranes===

The forewaters are released when the amnion ruptures. This is commonly known as &quot;water breaking.&quot; When this occurs during labour at term, it is known as &quot;spontaneous rupture of membranes&quot;. If the rupture precedes labour at term, however, it is referred to as &quot;pre-labour rupture of membranes.&quot; Spontaneous rupture of membranes before term is referred to as &quot;premature rupture of membranes.&quot; The majority of the hindwaters remain inside the womb until the baby is born. Artificial rupture of membrane (ARM), a manual rupture of the amniotic sac, can also be performed to release the fluid if the amnion has not spontaneously ruptured.

==Function==

Swallowed amniotic fluid (in later stages of development) creates urine and contributes to the formation of meconium. Amniotic fluid protects the developing fetus by cushioning against blows to the mother&#x27;s abdomen, allowing for easier fetal movement and promoting muscular/skeletal development. Amniotic fluid swallowed by the fetus helps in the formation of the gastrointestinal tract. It also protects the fetus from mechanical jerks and shocks. The fetus, which develops within a fluid-filled amniotic sac, relies on the placenta for respiratory gas exchange rather than the lungs. While not involved in fetal oxygenation, nevertheless have an important role in lung growth and in development of respiratory muscles and neural regulation. FBM are regulated differently in many respects than postnatal respiration, which results from the unique intrauterine environment. At birth, the transition to continuous postnatal respiration involves a fall in temperature, gaseous distention of the lungs, activation of the Hering-Breuer reflex, and functional connectivity of afferent O2 chemoreceptor activity with respiratory motoneurons and arousal centers.

==Clinical significance==

===Collection===
Amniotic fluid is removed from the mother by an amniocentesis procedure, where a long needle is inserted through the abdomen into the amniotic sac, using ultrasound guidance such that the fetus is not harmed. Amniocentesis is a low risk procedure, with risk of pregnancy loss between 1 in 1,500 – 1 in 700 procedures. Amniocentesis can be performed to obtain diagnostic genetic information, evaluate for intrauterine infection, or rarely, to assess for fetal lung maturity if early delivery is required. If warranted, fluid is collected between 16 and 42 weeks of fetal development. The amount of fluid removed depends on the indication for the procedure and the testing that will be performed on the fluid.

===Analysis===
Analysis of amniotic fluid can reveal many aspects of the baby&#x27;s genetic health as well as the age and viability of the fetus. This is because the fluid contains metabolic wastes and compounds used in assessing fetal age and lung maturity, but amniotic fluid also contains fetal cells, which can be examined for genetic defects.

Amniotic fluid normally has a pH of 7.0 to 7.5. Because pH in the upper vagina is normally acidic (pH 3.8–4.5), a vaginal pH test showing a pH of more than 4.5 strengthens a suspicion of rupture of membranes in case of clear vaginal discharge in pregnancy. Other tests for detecting amniotic fluid mainly include nitrazine paper test and fern test. One main test that is performed on amniotic fluid is the L/S ratio test (lecithin/sphingomyelin). This test is used to determine fetal lung maturity. Both lecithin and sphingomyelin are lung surfactants that are present in increasing amounts in the maturing fetus, though past week 33, sphingomyelin levels remain relatively constant. Measuring a ratio of L/S of 2:1 or greater indicates that the fetus can be safely delivered, with functioning lungs.

===Complications related to amniotic fluid===
Too little amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios. In a minority of cases, it can be a cause of problems for the mother and baby. These include contracture of the limbs, clubbing of the feet and hands, and also a life-threatening condition called hypoplastic lungs. The Potter sequence refers to a constellation of findings related to insufficient amniotic fluid.

On every prenatal visit, the obstetrician, gynaecologist or midwife should measure the patient&#x27;s fundal height with a tape measure. It is important that the fundal height be measured and properly recorded to track proper fetal growth and the increasing development of amniotic fluid. The obstetrician, gynaecologist or midwife should also routinely ultrasound the patient—this procedure will also give an indication of proper fetal growth and amniotic fluid development. Oligohydramnios can be caused by infection, kidney dysfunction or malformation (since much of the late amniotic fluid volume is urine), procedures such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Oligohydramnios can sometimes be treated with bed rest, oral and intravenous hydration, antibiotics, steroids, and amnioinfusion.

The opposite of oligohydramnios is polyhydramnios, an excess volume of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac.

Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but very often fatal condition for both mother and child.

=== Medical applications ===
It is being used in some surgeries of the outside of the eye. It is also being studied for some orthopaedic conditions.

=== Stem cell research===

Recent studies show that amniotic fluid contains a considerable quantity of stem cells. These amniotic stem cells are pluripotent and able to differentiate into various tissues, which may be useful for future human application. Some researchers have found that amniotic fluid is also a plentiful source of non-embryonic stem cells. These cells have demonstrated the ability to differentiate into a number of different cell-types, including brain, liver and bone.

It is possible to conserve the stem cells extracted from amniotic fluid in private stem cells banks.

<text>The Flight Engineer Badge was a qualification badge of the United States Army Air Forces authorized late in the Second World War on 19 June 1945. It was awarded to those military officers and NCOs who had qualified as flight engineers on board a military aircraft. As aircraft grew increasingly complex, the need arose for an in-flight specialist dedicated to monitoring and operating the various systems. However, prior to the creation of their own distinctive wings, flight engineers wore aircrew wings.

During the Korean War, the Flight Engineer Badge was slowly phased out by the United States Air Force and replaced with the Aircrew Badge. By 1962, the Flight Engineer Badge was no longer issued and had been declared obsolete. However, regulations through the early 1970s authorized USAF personnel who had been &quot;...granted aeronautical ratings no longer current ... to wear the aviation badge that was in effect when the rating was granted.&quot; The Flight Engineer Badge continued to be worn by some remaining World War II and Korean War veterans until they eventually retired or otherwise left military service. The badge is still worn today by some flight engineers as unofficial novelty badges, but only on flight suits during inflight operations. The official design incorporated a four-bladed propeller with 18 radial engine cylinders.

<text>Military art is art with a military subject matter, regardless of its style or medium. The battle scene is one of the oldest types of art in developed civilizations, as rulers have always been keen to celebrate their victories and intimidate potential opponents. The depiction of other aspects of warfare, especially the suffering of casualties and civilians, has taken much longer to develop. As well as portraits of military figures, depictions of anonymous soldiers on the battlefield have been very common; since the introduction of military uniforms such works often concentrate on showing the variety of these.

Naval scenes are very common, and battle scenes and &quot;ship portraits&quot; are mostly considered as a branch of marine art; the development of other large types of military equipment such as warplanes and tanks has led to new types of work portraying these, either in action or at rest. In 20th century wars official war artists were retained to depict the military in action; despite artists now being very close to the action the battle scene is mostly left to popular graphic media and the cinema. The term war art is sometimes used, mostly in relation to 20th century military art made during wartime.

==History==

===Ancient world===
Art depicting military themes has existed throughout history. The Battlefield Palette, a cosmetic palette from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt (circa ~3500 to 3000 BC) is incomplete, but shows prisoners being led away, and wild animals feasting on the dead. The Narmer Palette from the same period shows a military victory in a more symbolic style. The Stele of the Vultures, about 2,500 BC, is one of a number of Mesopotamian &quot;victory stelae&quot;. Also around 2,500 BC, the earliest known depiction of a city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. Although the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC appears to have been inconclusive, reliefs erected by Ramesses II show him scattering his Hittite opponents with his chariot.

Surviving Assyrian art mainly consists of large stone reliefs showing detailed scenes of either military campaigns or hunting; the Lachish reliefs are an example of the former. The ancient Greek Parthenon Marbles show lengthy parades of the city&#x27;s volunteer cavalry force, and many Greek vases show scenes of combat. In Han dynasty China, a famous stone relief of c. 150–170 AD from the Wu family shrines shows a battle between cavalry forces in the Campaign against Dong Zhuo.

In Ancient Roman art the most elaborate Roman triumphal columns showed very long reliefs of military campaigns winding round the body of huge columns; among the most impressive are those of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The Alexander Mosaic is a large and dramatic battle scene showing Alexander the Great defeating Darius III of Persia; it is a floor mosaic excavated from Pompeii, probably copying a lost painting. Many Hellenistic and Roman sarcophagi showed crowded scenes of combat, sometimes mythological (an amazonomachy is a term for a scene of battle between Amazons and Greeks), and usually not relating to a particular battle; these were not necessarily used to bury people with military experience. Such scenes had a great influence on Renaissance battle scenes. By the Late Roman Empire the reverse of coins very often showed soldiers and carried an inscription praising &#x27;our boys&#x27;, no doubt in hope of delaying the next military revolt.

===Medieval===
Christian art produced for the church generally avoided battle scenes, although a rare Late Antique motif shows Christ dressed as a victorious emperor in general&#x27;s dress, having conquered the devil, in Christ treading on the beasts and other iconographies. The violent tastes of the Anglo-Saxon elite managed to add the Harrowing of Hell, conceived as a raid on Satan&#x27;s stronghold, led by Christ, to the standard group of scenes for a cycle on the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;. Soldier saints, shown in military dress, were extremely popular, as were images of the Archangel Michael stabbing Satan as a dragon with a cross with a spear-point at its base. Some illuminated manuscripts illustrated the many battles in the Old Testament.

Secular works produced for secular patrons often show military themes, for example in illuminated manuscript copies of histories like the 15th century Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6), where most of the 112 miniatures show military scenes. The &quot;Siege of the Castle of Love&quot;, often found on Gothic ivory mirror-cases, showed knights attacking a castle defended by ladies, a metaphor from the literature of courtly love. The 11th century Bayeux Tapestry is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the Norman Conquest and the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the only surviving example of a type of embroidered hanging with which rich Anglo-Saxons used to decorate their homes. In Islamic art the battle scene, often from a fictional work of epic poetry, was a frequent subject in Persian miniatures, and the high viewpoint they adopted made the scenes more easily comprehensible than many Western images.

===Renaissance to Napoleonic Wars===
Italian Renaissance painting saw a great increase in military art by the leading artists, battle paintings often featuring near-contemporary scenes such as the huge set of three canvases of &quot;The Battle of San Romano&quot; (c. 1445) by Paolo Uccello, and the abortive &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot; (1504–1506) by Michelangelo and &quot;Battle of Anghiari&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci (1503–1506), which were intended to be placed opposite each other in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, but neither of which were completed. For Renaissance artists with their new skills in depicting the human figure, battle scenes allowed them to demonstrate all their skills in depicting complicated poses; Michelangelo choose a moment when a group of soldiers was surprised bathing, and almost all the figures are nude. Leonardo&#x27;s battle was a cavalry one, the central section of which was very widely seen before being destroyed, and hugely influential: it &quot;exerted a fundamental change on the whole idea of battle painting, an influence that lasted through the Late Renaissance and the Baroque up until the heroic machines of the Napoleonic painters and even the battle compositions of Delacroix&quot;, according to the art historian Frederick Hartt.

All of these depicted frankly minor actions where Florence had defeated neighbouring cities, but important battles from distant history were equally popular. Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Triumphs of Caesar&quot; shows the Roman triumphal parade of Julius Caesar, though concentrating on the booty rather than the army following it; the print series &quot;Triumphs of Maximilian&quot; shows both, leading up to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor riding on a huge carriage. &quot;The Battle of the Milvian Bridge&quot; by Giulio Romano brought a huge and &quot;seminal&quot; battle scene into the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Palace. The unusual &quot;The Battle of Alexander at Issus&quot; (1528–29) by Albrecht Altdorfer managed to make one of the most highly regarded Renaissance battle scenes, despite, or perhaps because of, having a vertical format, which was dictated by the planned setting; it was commissioned as one of a set of eight battle paintings by various artists. &quot;It was the most detailed and panoramic battle picture of its day&quot;, and its aerial viewpoint was to be very widely followed over the next centuries, though rarely to such dramatic effect.
Especially in Northern Europe, small groups of soldiers became a popular subject for paintings and especially prints by many artists, including Urs Graf, who is unusual in that he was a professional Swiss mercenary for many years. These works began to present a less heroic view of soldiers, who often represented a considerable threat to civilian populations even in peacetime, though the extravagant costumes of the Landsknecht are often treated as glamorous. For Peter Paret, from the Renaissance &quot;the glorification of the temporal leader and of his political system – which had of course also been present in medieval art – replaces the Christian faith as a determining interpretive force&quot; in military art.

Naval painting became conventionalized in 17th century Dutch Golden Age painting, and from then on artists tended to specialize in it or not attempt it; apart from anything else &quot;Marine artists have always dealt with a particularly demanding class of patron&quot;, as J. M. W. Turner found when the &quot;Sailor King&quot; William IV of the United Kingdom rejected his version of &quot;The Battle of Trafalgar&quot; because of inaccuracy. Hendrick Vroom was the earliest real specialist, followed by the father and son team of Willem van de Velde, who emigrated to London in 1673, and effectively founded the English tradition of naval painting, &quot;producing a stunning visual record of the Anglo-Dutch naval wars, which set the conventions of maritime battle painting for the next 150 years&quot;. Vroom had also worked for English patrons, designing a large set of tapestries of the defeat of the Spanish Armada which was destroyed when the Houses of Parliament burnt down in 1834.

The 17th and 18th centuries saw depictions of battles mostly adopting a bird&#x27;s eye view, as though from a hill nearby; this made them less interesting to paint, and the major artists now tended to avoid them. A very different view of warfare is seen in &quot;Les Grandes Misères de la guerre&quot; (&quot;The Misfortunes of War&quot;), a set of twelve etchings produced by Jacques Callot during the Thirty Years War which follows a group of soldiers ravaging the countryside before eventually being rounded up by their own side and executed. Also in the first half of the 17th century, a branch of genre painting in Dutch Golden Age painting specialized in guardroom scenes of rather disorderly soldiers, not often in battle, but ransacking farmhouses or sitting around in a camp guardroom. The paintings of Salvator Rosa, essentially landscapes, often showed groups variously described as bandits or soldiers lurking in the countryside of Southern Italy. &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot; by Velázquez (1634–35) shows a crowded scene as the two sides meet peacefully to surrender the town; a theme more often copied in naval painting than land-based military art.
From at least the late 15th century, sets of tapestries became the grandest medium for &quot;official military art&quot;; the Portuguese Pastrana Tapestries (1470s) were an early example. A set produced for the Duke of Marlborough showing his victories was varied for different clients, and even sold to one of his opponents, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, after reworking the general&#x27;s faces and other details.

In the mid-18th century, a number of artists, especially in Britain, sought to revive military art with large works centered on a heroic incident that would once again bring the genre to the fore in history painting, as it had been in the Renaissance. The standard contemporary battle scene tended to be grouped in the lowly category of topographical painting, covering maps and views of country houses. &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; (1771) by Benjamin West, &quot;The Death of Captain James Cook&quot; (1779) by Johann Zoffany, &quot;The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782&quot; and &quot;The Death of Major Pierson&quot; (1784) by John Singleton Copley are leading examples of the new type, which ignored complaints about the unsuitability of modern dress for heroic subjects. However, such works had more immediate influence in France than in Britain.
In the Napoleonic era, France added Romanticism to its style and began to portray individual soldiers with more character. Battle paintings were increasingly produced for large public buildings, and grew larger than ever before. Baron Gros painted mostly glorifications of Napoleon and his victories, but his 1808 painting of the &quot;Battle of Eylau&quot; does not neglect the suffering of the dead and wounded on the frozen battlefield. In contrast, Goya&#x27;s large paintings &quot;The Second of May 1808&quot; and &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;, perhaps consciously conceived as a riposte to Gros, and his related series of 82 etchings, &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra&quot;), emphasized the brutality of the French forces during the Peninsular War in Spain. British depictions of the Napoleonic Wars continued the late 18th century patterns, often on a larger scale, with the death of Admiral Horatio Nelson quickly producing large works by Arthur William Devis (&quot;The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805&quot;) and West (&quot;The Death of Nelson&quot;). J. M. W. Turner was among the artists who produced scenes of Nelson&#x27;s victories, with &quot;The Battle of Trafalgar&quot;. The British Institution ran competitions for sketches of art commemorating British victories, the winning entries being then commissioned.
In this period the uniform print, concentrating on a detailed depiction of the uniform of one or more standing figures, typically hand-coloured, also became very popular across Europe. Like other prints these were typically published in book form, but also sold individually. In Britain the 87 prints of &quot;The Loyal Volunteers of London&quot; (1797–98) by Thomas Rowlandson, published by Rudolph Ackermann, mark the start of the classic period. Though Rowlandson usually satirized his subjects to some degree, here the soldiers were &quot;represented as they, and particularly their colonels who paid for their uniforms, preferred to see themselves&quot;, which remained the usual depiction in such prints. A by Carle Vernet of the splendid uniforms of &quot;La Grande Armée de 1812&quot; showed most foot-soldiers in pairs in camp, in a variety of relaxed poses that showed one from the front and the other from behind. A rare oil painting by a leading artist that treats soldiers in the spirit of the uniform print is &quot;Soldiers of the 10th Light Dragoons&quot; (the &quot;Prince of Wales Own&quot;) painted in 1793 by George Stubbs for their Colonel in Chief, the future George IV of the United Kingdom. Other paintings of single soldiers were more dramatic, like Théodore Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Charging Chasseur&quot; (c. 1812).

===Nineteenth century===
Eugène Delacroix, who also painted many smaller combat scenes, finished his &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot; in 1824, showing a then notorious attack on Greek civilians by Ottoman forces during the Greek War of Independence, who are shown in an entirely negative light. It had a more immediate impact on European art than Goya&#x27;s &quot;Tres de Mayo&quot; (&quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;) of a few years earlier, which was apparently not even on display in the Prado Museum until some years later. In contrast, Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; of 1830 showed fighting in a positive light, but not the &quot;military&quot; as it shows armed civilian revolutionaries of the July Revolution, advancing against the unseen uniformed forces of the government. Turkish atrocities were to remain a recurrent theme in 19th-century painting, especially in former Ottoman territories escaped from the declining empire (often pre-rape scenes treated rather salaciously), and general anti-military sentiments, previously mostly found in prints, were also to emerge regularly in large oil paintings.

Military art remained popular during the remainder of the 19th century in most of Europe. French artists such as Ernest Meissonier, Edouard Detaille, and Alphonse de Neuville established military genre painting in the Paris Salon. New forms of military art which developed in the 1850s met considerable opposition from the Royal Academy in the United Kingdom.
European artists in a generally academic style who were well known as painters of battle scenes, still often of subjects from the Napoleonic Wars or older conflicts, included Albrecht Adam, Nicaise de Keyser, Piotr Michałowski Antoine Charles Horace Vernet, Emile Jean Horace Vernet, Wilhelm Camphausen and Emil Hünten. The rise of nationalism promoted battle painting in countries such as Hungary (great attention paid to uniforms), Poland (huge forces) and the Czech Lands. Jan Matejko&#x27;s enormous &quot;Battle of Grunwald&quot; (1878) reflects Pan-Slav sentiment, showing various Slav forces joining to smash the power of the Teutonic Knights.

The usage of the term &quot;military art&quot; has evolved since the middle of the 19th century. In France, Charles Baudelaire discussed military art, and the impact on it of photography, in the Paris Salon of 1859. A British critic of the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861 observed that 

In contrast, the British artist Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler) explained that she &quot;never painted for the glory of war, but to portray its pathos and heroism.&quot; The aftermath of battle was depicted in paintings like &quot;Calling the Roll After An Engagement, Crimea&quot;, which displayed at the Royal Academy in 1874. This perspective is also seen in &quot;Remnants of an Army&quot; which showed William Brydon struggling into Jalalabad on a dying horse. Dr. Brydon was the sole survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, in which 16,000 were massacred by Afghan tribesmen.

The British market began to develop in the middle of the 19th century. The relations between the state and its military, and the ideologies which are implied in that relationship affected the artwork, the artists and the public perceptions of both artwork and artists.

By the time of the American Civil War and the Crimean War photographers began to compete strongly with artists in coverage of scenes in camp, and the aftermath of battle, but exposure times were generally too long to enable them to take pictures of battles very effectively. War photography is not covered in this article. Illustrations for newspapers and magazines continued a heroic style with perhaps more confidence than painters, and Melton Prior followed British forces around Imperial troublespots for decades, working for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;; his scenes &quot;helped to establish a style of action draughtsmanship which has left an indelible stamp on the art of the comic strip.&quot; Prior and other &quot;special correspondents&quot; such as Frederic Villiers were known as &quot;specials&quot;. Richard Caton Woodville Jr. and Charles Edwin Fripp were &quot;specials&quot; and also painters who exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere.

===Twentieth century===
World War I very largely confirmed the end of the glorification of war in art, which had been in decline since the end of the previous century. In general, and despite the establishment of large schemes employing official war artists, the most striking art depicting the war is that emphasizing its horror. Official war artists were appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield; but many artists fought as normal soldiers and recorded their experiences at the time and later, including the Germans George Grosz and Otto Dix, who had both fought on the Western Front, and continued to depict the subject for the rest of their careers. Dix&#x27;s &quot;The Trench&quot; (1923), showing the dismembered bodies of the dead after an assault, caused a scandal, and was first displayed behind a curtain, before causing the dismissal of the museum director who had planned to buy it. Later, after exhibiting it in their 1937 travelling exhibition of &quot;Degenerate art&quot;, the Nazi government burnt it. He produced a set of fifty prints in 1924 on &quot;Der Krieg&quot; (&quot;The War&quot;). The English artist Paul Nash began to make drawings of the war while fighting on the Western Front in the Artists Rifles. After recovering from a wound he was recruited as an official war artist and produced many of the most memorable images from the British side of both World Wars. After the war, the huge demand for war memorials caused a boom for sculptors, covered below, and makers of stained-glass.

Posters had become universal by 1914 and were addressed at both the military and the &quot;home front&quot; for various purposes, including recruitment, where the British &quot;Lord Kitchener Wants You&quot; (not actually the slogan) was repeated in the United States with Uncle Sam, and elsewhere with similar totemic figures. The Soviet Union began with very Modernist posters such as &quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot; by Lazar Markovich Lissitzky but soon turned to socialist realism, used for most World War II posters from the Soviet Union, which sometimes are similar to their Nazi equivalents. In World War II they were even more widely used. Illustrators and sketch artists such as Norman Rockwell also followed the trend away from military themed shots following the Second World War and with the rise of photographic covers in general.

The impact of the Spanish Civil War on a non-combatant populace was depicted in Picasso&#x27;s 1937 masterpiece, &quot;Guernica&quot;, showing the 1937 bombing of Guernica; a very different treatment of a similar subject is seen in Henry Moore&#x27;s drawings of sleeping civilians sheltering from The Blitz bombing on the station platforms of the London Underground. Among official World War II war artists, Paul Nash&#x27;s &quot;Totes Meer&quot; is a powerful image of a scrapyard of shot-down German aircraft, and the landscapist Eric Ravilious produced some very fine paintings before being shot down and killed in 1942. Edward Ardizzone&#x27;s pictures concentrated entirely on soldiers relaxing or performing routine duties, and were praised by many soldiers: &quot;He is the only person who has caught the atmosphere of this war&quot; felt Douglas Cooper, the art critic and historian, friend of Picasso, and then in a military medical unit. Photography and film were now able to capture fast-moving action, and can fairly be said to have produced most of memorable images recording combat in the war, and certainly subsequent conflicts like the Vietnam War, which was more notable for specifically anti-war protest art, in posters and the work of artists like Nancy Spero. Contemporary military art is part of the subfield &quot;military and popular culture&quot;.

==Art forms==

===Portraiture===

Rulers have been shown in specifically military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in Ancient Roman sculpture, where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic. Medieval tomb effigies more often than not depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service. In the Early Modern period, when senior commanders tended to wear their normal riding dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the buff leather jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again, although initially officer&#x27;s uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.

Full-length and equestrian portraits of rulers and generals often showed them on the battlefield, but with the action in the distant background; a feature probably dating back to Titian&#x27;s magisterial &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Charles V&quot;, which shows the emperor after his victory at the Battle of Mühlberg but with no other soldiers present. Monarchs were not often painted in military uniform until the Napoleonic period, but in the 19th century this became typical for formal portraits, perhaps because uniform was more visually appealing. A distinctively Dutch type of painting are huge group portraits commissioned by the wealthy part-time officers of city militia companies, of which Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot; (1642) is the most famous, although its narrative setting is atypical of the genre. Most examples just show the officers lined up as though about to eat dinner, and some show them actually eating it. Otherwise group portraits of officers are rather surprisingly rare until the 19th century.

===Sculpture===

Most surviving sculpture of battle scenes from antiquity is in stone reliefs, covered above. Renaissance artists and patrons were keen to revive this form, which they mostly did in much smaller scenes in stone or bronze. The tomb in Milan of the brilliant French general Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours included numerous marble reliefs round the base of the sarcophagus (which was never completed). Statues and tomb monuments of commanders continued to be the most common site until the more general war memorial commemorating all the dead began to emerge in the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson&#x27;s Column in London still commemorates a single commander; it has very large reliefs around the base by different artists, although these are generally regarded as less memorable than other aspects of the monument. Wellington&#x27;s Column in Liverpool is also known as the &quot;Waterloo Memorial&quot;, shifting to the more modern concept when &quot;the dead were remembered essentially as soldiers who fought in the name of national collectives&quot;.

The huge losses of the American Civil War saw the first really large group of sculptural war memorials, as well as many monuments for individuals. Among the most artistically outstanding is the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the all-black 54th Regiment by Augustus Saint-Gaudens in Boston, with a second cast in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. The even larger losses of World War I led even small communities in most nations involved to raise some form of memorial, introducing the widespread use of the form to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the sudden increase in demand leading to a boom for sculptors of public art. Even more than in painting, the war brought a crisis in style, as much public opinion felt the traditional heroic styles inappropriate. One of the most successful British memorials is the starkly realist Royal Artillery Memorial in London, the masterpiece of Charles Sargeant Jagger, who had been wounded three times in the war and spent most of the next decade commemorating it. In the defeated nations of Germany and Austria controversy, which had a political aspect, was especially fierce, and a number of memorials considered excessively modern were removed by the Nazis, whose own memorials, such as the Tannenberg Memorial were removed after World War II. Other solutions were to make memorials more neutral, as in the repurposed Neue Wache in Berlin, since rededicated to different groups several times, and the dignified architectural forms of the Cenotaph in London (widely imitated) and the German Laboe Naval Memorial; tombs of the Unknown Warrior and eternal flames were other ways of avoiding controversy. Some, like the Canadian National War Memorial, and most French memorials, were content to update traditional styles.

A great number of World War I memorials were simply expanded in scope to cover the dead of World War II, and often subsequent conflicts. The now dominant role of photography in depicting war is reflected in the National Iwo Jima Memorial, which recreates the iconic 1945 photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;. The National D-Day Memorial, a project of the 1990s, includes strongly realist sculpture, in contrast to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. More innovative memorials have often been erected for the civilian victims of war, above all those of the Holocaust.

==Scope==

===Peacetime===

Military art encompasses actions of military forces in times of peace. For example, USMC Sgt. Kristopher Battles, the only remaining official American war artist in 2010, deployed with American forces in Haiti to provide humanitarian relief as part of Operation Unified Response after the disastrous earthquake in 2010.

===Wartime===
====Purpose====
War art creates a visual account of military conflict by showing its impact as men and women are shown waiting, preparing, fighting, suffering, and celebrating.The subjects encompass many aspects of war, and the individual&#x27;s experience of war, whether allied or enemy, service or civilian, military or political, social or cultural. The thematic range embraces the causes, course and consequences of conflict.

War art, a significant expression of any culture and its significant legacies, combines artistic and documentary functions to provide a pictorial portrayal of war scenes and show &quot;how war shapes lives.&quot; It represents an attempt to come to terms with the nature and reality of violence. War art is typically realistic, capturing factual, eyewitness detail as well as the emotional impression and impact of events. Art and war becomes &quot;a tussle between the world of the imagination and the world of action&quot; — a constant tension between the factual representation of events and an artist&#x27;s interpretation of those events.

Part of the tussle includes determining how best to illustrate complex war scenes. C.E.W. Bean&#x27;s &quot;Anzac Book&quot;, for example, influenced Australian artists who grew up between the two world wars. When they were asked to depict a second multi-nation war after 1939, there was a precedent and format for them to follow.

War art has been used as an instrument of propaganda, such as a nation-building function or other persuasive ends. War art is also captured in caricature, which offers contemporary insights. Western Civilization and aesthetic tradition were both clearly marked by military conflicts throughout history. War drove culture and culture drove war. The legacy of war inspired artworks reads like a series of mile markers, documenting the meandering course of civilization&#x27;s evolutionary map.

====War artists====

War artists may be involved as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel who respond to powerful inner urges to depict direct war experience, or individuals who are officially commissioned to be present and record military activity.

As an example of nation&#x27;s efforts to document war events, official Japanese war artists were commissioned to create artwork in the context of a specific war for the Japanese government, including &quot;sensō sakusen kirokuga&quot; (&quot;war campaign documentary painting&quot;). Between 1937 and 1945, approximately 200 pictures depicting Japan&#x27;s military campaigns were created. These pictures were presented at large-scale exhibitions during the war years; After the end of World War II, Americans took possession of Japanese artwork.

There are some who may choose not to create war art. During the course of World War II, the Italians created virtually no art which documented the conflict. The French began to paint the war only after the war was ended in 1945.

====Classical examples====
Examples of classical war art include the friezes of warriors at the Temple of Aphaia in Greece or the Bayeux Tapestry, is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the Norman Conquest and the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

<doc id="977762" wikidata="Q779374" url="?curid=977762" title="Umbilical cord prolapse">
<text>Umbilical cord prolapse is when the umbilical cord comes out of the uterus with or before the presenting part of the baby. The concern with cord prolapse is that pressure on the cord from the baby will compromise blood flow to the baby. It usually occurs during labor but can occur anytime after the rupture of membranes.
The greatest risk factors are an abnormal position of the baby within the uterus and a premature or small baby. Other risk factors include a multiple pregnancy, more than one previous delivery, and too much amniotic fluid. Whether medical rupture of the amniotic sac is a risk is controversial. The diagnosis should be suspected if there is a sudden decrease in the baby&#x27;s heart rate during labor. Seeing or feeling the cord confirms the diagnosis.
Management focuses on quick delivery, usually by cesarean section. Filling the bladder or pushing up the baby by hand is recommended until this can take place. Sometimes women will be placed in a knee-chest position or the Trendelenburg position in order to help prevent further cord compression. With appropriate management, the majority of cases have good outcomes.
Umbilical cord prolapse occurs in about 1 in 500 pregnancies. The risk of death of the baby is about 10%. However, much of this risk is due to congenital anomalies or prematurity. It is considered an emergency.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first sign of umbilical cord prolapse is usually a sudden and severe decrease in fetal heart rate that does not immediately resolve. On fetal heart tracing (a linear recording of the fetal heart rate) this would usually look like moderate to severe variable decelerations. In overt cord prolapse, the cord can be seen or felt on the vulva or vagina.

The main issue with cord prolapse is that, once the cord is prolapsed, it is prone to compression by the foetus and the womb. This can cause decrease in oxygen supply to the foetus which can be fatal. 

A majority of umbilical cord prolapse cases happen during the second stage of labor.

==Risk factors==
Risk factors that are associated with umbilical cord prolapse tend to make it difficult for the baby from appropriately engaging and filling the maternal pelvis or are related to abnormalities of the umbilical cord. The two major categories of risk factors are spontaneous and iatrogenic (those that result from medical intervention).
* spontaneous factors:
** fetal malpresentation: abnormal fetal lie tends to result in space below the baby in the maternal pelvis, which can then be occupied by the cord.
** polyhydramnios, or an abnormally high amount of amniotic fluid
** prematurity: likely related to increased chance of malpresentation and relative polyhydramnios.
** low birth weight: usually described as &lt;2500g at birth, though some studies will use &lt;1500g. Cause is likely similar to those for prematurity.
** multiple gestation, or being pregnant with more than one baby at a given time: more likely to occur in the baby that is not born first.
** spontaneous rupture of membranes: about half of prolapses occur within 5 minutes of membrane rupture, two-thirds within 1 hour, 95% within 24 hours.
* treatment associated factors:
**artificial rupture of membranes
** placement of internal monitors (for example, internal scalp electrode or intrauterine pressure catheter)
** manual rotation of fetal head

==Diagnosis==
Umbilical cord prolapse should always be considered a possibility when there is a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate or variable decelerations, particularly after the rupture of membranes. With overt prolapses, the diagnosis can be confirmed if the cord can be felt on vaginal examination. Without overt prolapse, the diagnosis can only be confirmed after a cesarean section, though even then it will not always be evident at time of procedure.

===Classification===
There are three types of umbilical prolapse that can occur:
* overt umbilical cord prolapse: descent of the umbilical cord past the presenting fetal part. In this case, the cord is through the cervix and into or beyond the vagina. Overt umbilical cord prolapse requires rupture of membranes. This is the most common type of cord prolapse.
* occult umbilical prolapse: descent of the umbilical cord alongside the presenting fetal part, but has not advanced past the presenting fetal part. Occult umbilical prolapse can occur with both intact or ruptured membranes.
* funic (cord) presentation: presence of the umbilical cord between the presenting fetal part and fetal membranes. In this case, the cord has not passed the opening of the cervix. In funic presentation, the membranes are not yet ruptured.

==Management==
The typical treatment of umbilical cord prolapse in the setting of a viable pregnancy involves immediate delivery by the quickest and safest route possible. This usually requires cesarean section, especially if the woman is in early labor. Occasionally, vaginal delivery will be attempted if clinical judgment determines that is a safer or quicker method.

Other interventions during management of cord prolapse are typically used to decrease the chance of complications while preparations for delivery are being made. These interventions are focused on reducing pressure on the cord to prevent fetal complications from cord compression. The following maneuvers are among those used in clinical practice:
* Manual elevation of the presenting fetal part.
* Repositioning of the mother to be in the knee-chest position or Trendelenburg position (head down with feet elevated), lying on left side is usually preferred.
* Filling of the bladder using a foley catheter can help elevate the presenting fetal part and lift it off the cord.
* Use of tocolytics (medications to suppress labor) have been proposed, usually done in addition to bladder filling rather than as a stand-alone intervention.

If the mother is far from delivery, funic reduction (manually placing the cord back into the uterine cavity) has been attempted, with successful cases reported. However, this is not currently recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), as there is insufficient evidence to support this maneuver.

==Outcomes==
The primary concern with umbilical cord prolapse is inadequate blood supply, and thus oxygen, to the baby if the cord becomes compressed. The cord can become compressed either due to mechanical pressure (usually from the presenting fetal part) or from sudden contraction of the vessels due to decreased temperatures in the vagina in comparison to the uterus. This can lead to death of the baby or other complications.

Historically, the rate of fetal death in the setting of cord prolapse has been as high 40%. However, these estimates occurred in the context of home or births outside of the hospital. When considering cord prolapses that have occurred in inpatient labor and delivery settings, the rate drops to as low as 0-3%, though the mortality rate remains higher than for babies without cord prolapse. The reduction in mortality for hospital births is likely due to the ready availability of immediate cesarean section.

Many other fetal outcomes have been studied, including Apgar score (a quick assessment of a newborn&#x27;s health status) at 5 minutes and length of hospitalization after delivery. While both measures are worse for newborns delivered after cord prolapse, it is unclear what effect this has in the long-term. Relatively large studies that have tried to quantify long-term effects of cord prolapse on children found that less than 1% (1 in 120 studied) had a major neurologic disability, and less than 1% (110 in 16,675) had diagnosed cerebral palsy.

==Epidemiology==
Rates of umbilical cord prolapse ranges from 0.1 to 0.6% of all pregnancies. This rate has remained stable over time. A recent study estimates 77% of cord prolapses occur in singleton pregnancies (where there is only one baby). In twin pregnancies, cord prolapses occur more frequently in the second twin to be delivered, with 9% in the first twin and 14% in the second twin.

<text>Sir Simon Philip Baron-Cohen (born 15 August 1958) is a British clinical psychologist and professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge. He is the director of the university&#x27;s Autism Research Centre and a Fellow of Trinity College.

In 1985, Baron-Cohen formulated the mindblindness theory of autism, the evidence for which he collated and published in 1995. In 1997, he formulated the prenatal sex steroid theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015. In 2003, he formulated the empathising-systemising (E-S) theory of autism and typical sex differences, the key test of which was published in 2018.

He has also made major contributions to research on autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and vulnerability, autism intervention and synaesthesia. Baron-Cohen was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to people with autism. In 2023, he was awarded the Medical Research Council (MRC) Millennium Medal.

==Early life and education==
Baron-Cohen was born into a middle-class Jewish family in London, the second son of Judith and Hyman Vivian Baron-Cohen.

He completed a BA in human sciences at New College, Oxford, and an MPhil in clinical psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King&#x27;s College London. He received a PhD in psychology at University College London; his doctoral research was in collaboration with his supervisor Uta Frith.

==Career==
Baron-Cohen is professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. He is the director of the university&#x27;s Autism Research Centre and a Fellow of Trinity College.

He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society (BPS), the British Academy, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Association for Psychological Science. He is a BPS Chartered Psychologist and a Senior Investigator at the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).

He serves as vice-president of the National Autistic Society (UK), and was the 2012 chairman of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guideline Development Group for adults with autism. He has served as vice-president and president of the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR). He was founding co-editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Molecular Autism&quot;.

He was the chair of the Psychology Section of the British Academy. He is also a clinical psychologist who has created a diagnosis clinic in the UK for late autism diagnosis in adults.

Baron-Cohen gave the keynote lecture on the topic of Autism and Human Rights at the United Nations on World Autism Awareness Day in 2017.

In 2024, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship to the Royal Society of Medicine for his contributions to the field of psychiatry.

==Research==
=== The mindblindness theory of autism ===
Baron-Cohen has worked in autism research for over 40 years, starting in 1982. In 1985, while he was member of the MRC Cognitive Development Unit (CDU) in London, he and his colleagues Uta Frith and Alan Leslie formulated the &quot;theory of mind&quot; (ToM) hypothesis, to explain the social-communication difficulties in autism. ToM (also known as &quot;cognitive empathy&quot;) is the brain&#x27;s partially innate mechanism for rapidly making sense of social behavior by effortlessly attributing mental states to others, enabling behavioral prediction and social communication skills. They confirmed this using the false belief test, showing that a typical four-year-old child can infer another person&#x27;s belief that is different to their own, while autistic children on average are delayed in this ability.

Baron-Cohen&#x27;s 1995 book, &quot;Mindblindness&quot; summarized his subsequent experiments in ToM and the disability in ToM in autism. He went on to show that autistic children are blind to the mentalistic significance of the eyes and show difficulties in advanced ToM, measured by the &quot;reading the mind in the eyes test&quot; (or &quot;eyes test&quot;) that he designed. He conducted the first neuroimaging study of ToM in typical and autistic adults, and studied patients with acquired brain damage, demonstrating lesions in the orbito- and medial-prefrontal cortex and amygdala can impair ToM. He also reported the first evidence of atypical amygdala function in autism during ToM. In 2017, his team studied 80K genotyped individuals who took the eyes test. He found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) partly contribute to individual differences on this dimensional trait measure on which autistic people show difficulties. This was the evidence that cognitive empathy/ToM is partly heritable. The National Institutes of Health recommended Baron-Cohen&#x27;s eyes test as a core measure that should be used as part of the Research Domain Criteria (RDOC) for assessing social cognition.

=== Empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory ===
In 1997, Baron-Cohen developed the empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory. Empathizing includes both cognitive empathy (imagining what someone else is thinking or feeling) and affective empathy (responding with an appropriate emotion to what someone is thinking or feeling). Systemizing is the drive to analyse or construct rule-based systems to understand how things work. A system is defined as anything that follows if-and-then patterns or rules.

The E-S theory argues that typical females on average score higher on empathizing relative to systemizing (they are more likely to have a brain of type E), and typical males on average score higher on systemizing relative to empathizing (they are more likely to have a brain of type S). Autistic people are predicted to score as an extreme of the typical male (they are more likely to have a brain of type S or extreme type S). These predictions were confirmed in a 2018 online study of 600,000 non-autistic people and 36,000 autistic people. This also confirmed that autistic people on average are &quot;hyper-systemizers&quot;.

Working with the personal genomics company 23andMe, Baron-Cohen&#x27;s team studied 56K genotyped individuals who had taken the Systemizing Quotient. He and his colleagues found that the common genetic variants associated with systemizing overlapped with the common genetic variants associated with autism. He concluded that the genetics of autism not only includes genes associated with disability but also include genes associated with talent in pattern recognition and understanding how things work.

=== Prenatal neuroendocrinology ===
Baron-Cohen&#x27;s work in E-S theory led him to investigate whether higher levels of prenatal testosterone explain the increased rate of autism among males. His prenatal sex steroid theory of autism had preliminary support in 2009 in finding that prenatal testosterone was positively correlated with autistic traits in childhood and gained additional support in 2015 and 2019 in finding elevated prenatal androgens and estrogens in pregnancies that later were linked to a diagnosis of autism.

In his 2004 book &quot;Prenatal Testosterone in Mind&quot; (MIT Press), Baron-Cohen put forward the prenatal sex steroid theory of autism. He proposed this theory to understand why autism is more common in males. Using the Cambridge Child Development Project that he established in 1997, a longitudinal study studying children of 600 women who had undergone amniocentesis in pregnancy, he followed these children postnatally. This study demonstrated, for the first time in humans, how normative variation in amniotic prenatal testosterone levels correlates with individual differences in typical postnatal brain and behavioral development. His team discovered that in typical children, amount of eye contact, rate of vocabulary development, quality of social relationships, theory of mind performance, and scores on the empathy quotient are all inversely correlated with prenatal testosterone levels. In contrast, he found that scores on the embedded figures test (of attention to detail), on the systemizing quotient (SQ), measures of narrow interests, and number of autistic traits are positively correlated with prenatal testosterone levels. Within this study his team conducted the first human neuroimaging studies of brain grey matter regional volumes and brain activity associated with prenatal testosterone. Other clues for the theory came from Baron-Cohen&#x27;s postnatal hormonal studies which found that autistic adults have elevated circulating androgens in serum and that the autistic brain in women is &#x27;masculinized&#x27; in both grey and white matter brain volume. An independent animal model by Xu et al. (2015, &quot;Physiology and Behavior&quot;, 138, 13–20) showed that elevated prenatal testosterone during pregnancy leads to reduced social interest in the offspring.

Baron-Cohen&#x27;s group also studied the rate of autism in offspring of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a medical condition caused by elevated prenatal testosterone. He found that in women with PCOS, the odds of having a child with autism are significantly increased. This has been replicated in three other countries (Sweden, Finland, and Israel) and is in line with the finding that mothers of autistic children themselves have elevated sex steroid hormones. But to really test the theory, Baron-Cohen needed a much larger sample than his Cambridge Child Development Project, since autism only occurs in 1% of the population. So, in 2015, he set up a collaboration with the Danish Biobank which has stored over 20 thousand amniotic fluid samples which he linked to later diagnosis of autism via the Danish Psychiatric Register. He tested the prenatal androgens and found that children later diagnosed as autistic were exposed to elevated levels of prenatal testosterone, and the Δ4 sex steroid precursors to prenatal testosterone. In 2019 he tested the same cohort&#x27;s levels of exposure to prenatal estrogens and again found these were elevated in pregnancies that resulted in autism. These novel studies provide evidence of the role of prenatal hormones, interacting with genetic predisposition, in the cause of autism.

=== Other contributions ===
In 2006, Baron-Cohen proposed the assortative mating theory which states that if individuals with a systemizing or &quot;type S&quot; brain type have a child, the child is more likely to be autistic. One piece of evidence for this theory came from his population study in Eindhoven, where autism rates are twice as high in that city which is an IT hub, compared to other Dutch cities. In addition, he found both mothers and fathers of autistic children score above average on tests of attention to detail, a prerequisite for strong systemizing.

In 2001, he developed the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ), a set of fifty questions that measures how many autistic traits a person has. This was one of the first measures to show that autistic traits run right through the general population and that autistic people on average simply score higher than non-autistic people. Baron-Cohen has replied to this by saying there are no questions in the AQ that ask about mathematical interest, and that the finding that AQ is associated with scientific and mathematical talent has been found in multiple studies, suggesting these may have shared mechanism such as strong systemizing. The AQ has subsequently been used in hundreds of studies including one study of half a million people, showing robust sex differences and higher scores in those who work in STEM. Multiple studies have also shown that both psychological and biological variables correlate with the number of autistic traits a person has.

Baron-Cohen also developed &quot;Mindreading&quot;, for use in special education. His team also developed &quot;The Transporters&quot;, an animation series aimed at teaching emotion recognition to preschool age autistic children, and conducted the first clinical trial of lego therapy in the UK, finding that autistic children improve in social skills following this. 

He has also contributed to applied autism research. He found that autistic people are being failed by the criminal justice system, and have higher rates of suicidality, higher rates of postnatal depression, and higher rates of mental and physical health conditions.

===Reception===
Spectrum News had described the work of Baron-Cohen on theory of mind as &quot;a landmark study&quot;. The Lancet described him as &quot;a man with extraordinary knowledge, but his passionate advocacy for a more tolerant, diverse society, where difference is respected and cultivated, reveals a very human side to his science&quot;. 

Baron-Cohen&#x27;s book, &quot;The Essential Difference&quot; was described by The Guardian as &quot;compelling and inspiring&quot; while his book, &quot;The Pattern Seekers&quot; was selected as the Editor&#x27;s Choice by the New York Times. A book review published in &quot;Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences&quot; characterized &quot;The Essential Difference&quot; as &quot;very disappointing&quot;. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, his views on systemizing traits had &quot;earned him the ire of some parents of autistic children, who complain that he underestimates their families&#x27; suffering&quot;. Baron-Cohen has replied in an op-ed in Scientific American acknowledging the challenges families face. He has also commented that the huge body of scientific evidence supporting predictions from the mindblindness and E-S theories cannot be ignored.

Baron-Cohen and his book The Science of Evil were described by The New York Times &quot;an award-winning psychologist&quot; who had &quot;unveiled a simple but persuasive hypothesis for a new way to think about evil.&quot;

Baron-Cohen&#x27;s &quot;empathizing-systemizing theory&quot; was published in &quot;Science&quot;, and states that humans may be classified on the basis of their scores along two dimensions (empathizing and systemizing); and that females tend to score higher on the empathizing dimension and males tend to score higher on the systemizing dimension. Feminist scientists, including Cordelia Fine, neuroscientist Gina Rippon, and Lise Eliot have questioned his extreme male brain theory of autism. Baron-Cohen has defended the study of sex differences against their charges of neurosexism, clarifying that gender differences only apply to differences on average between groups of males and females, and agrees that it would be sexist and unacceptable to prejudge an individual based on their gender since a person&#x27;s mind may not be typical of their gender. Multiple data sets have now confirmed the E-S and extreme male brain theories. 

&quot;Time&quot; magazine has also criticized the assortative mating theory proposed by Baron-Cohen, claiming that it is largely speculative and based on anecdotal evidence. The theory claims that autism rates are increasing because &quot;systemizers&quot;, individuals with more autistic traits, are more likely to marry each other and are more likely to have autistic offspring due to relatively recent societal changes. James McGrath has criticized the autism-spectrum quotient, writing that the score increases if one indicates interest in mathematics, and decreases if one indicates interest in literature or art. He claims that this leads to the false notion that most autistic people are strong in math.

Critics also argue that Baron-Cohen&#x27;s focus on autistic people without intellectual or learning disability limits how far his findings can be generalised. Baron-Cohen has acknowledged that a disproportionate amount of autism research globally is conducted with autistic people without learning (intellectual) disabilities and has called for more research with autistic people who have learning disabilities, to ensure that autism research serves the whole autism community. But he challenges this criticism in pointing out that even among those with learning disability, strong systemizing is observed.

The theory of mind deficit hypothesis, especially the universal core deficit version, has faced many criticisms from some people in the autism community and from researchers. Baron-Cohen has commented that many studies have replicated the findings with group-level on-average differences, despite the heterogeneity of autism in terms of empathy and ToM, including multiple studies conducted by Simon Baron-Cohen in recent years, which found that around 40–60% of autistic people have impaired ToM and empathy, whereas the other 40–60% of autistic people are unimpaired or above average in ToM and empathy.

The &quot;mindblindness&quot; hypothesis has faced criticism from some people in the autism community who have argued that non-autistic people are as blind to the mental states of autistic people as autistic people are to those of non-autistic people. This is referred to as the “double-empathy” problem. There is also criticism of Baron-Cohen&#x27;s concept of theory of mind on the grounds that it implies that autistic people as not fully human. Regarding the first criticism, Baron-Cohen has agreed that the “double-empathy” problem is an important contribution to this field. Regarding the second criticism, Baron-Cohen has replied that autistic people are fully human and that theory of mind simply exists on a bell curve of individual differences.

==Recognition==
Baron-Cohen was awarded the 1990 Spearman Medal from the BPS, the McAndless Award from the American Psychological Association, the 1993 May Davidson Award for Clinical Psychology from the BPS, and the 2006 presidents&#x27; Award from the BPS.

He received an honorary degree from Abertay University in 2012, and was awarded the Kanner-Asperger Medal in 2013 by the &quot;Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft Autismus-Spektrum&quot; as a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to autism research. He was also knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to people with autism.

Baron-Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Mindreading&quot; and &quot;The Transporters&quot; special educational software were nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards in 2002 and 2007.

In 2023, he was awarded the Medical Research Council (MRC) Millennium Medal for his work on the prenatal sex steroid theory of autism and the transformative contributions to autism.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Baron-Cohen married Bridget Lindley. Together, they had three children.

He has an elder brother Dan Baron Cohen and three younger siblings, brother Ash Baron-Cohen and sisters Suzie and Liz. His cousins include actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and composer Erran Baron Cohen.

<doc id="977771" wikidata="Q6996001" url="?curid=977771" title="Nerds (candy)">
<text>Nerds is an American candy launched in 1983 by the Sunmark Corporation under the brand name Willy Wonka Candy Company. Nerds are now made by the Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero Group. but is still distributed internationally by Nestlé. With their anthropomorphic covers, Nerds usually contain two flavors per box, each flavor having a separate compartment and opening.

Nerds were first introduced in 1983 and rolled out nationally in 1985. It was developed by a team led by marketing manager Angelo Fraggos at Sunmark&#x27;s Willy Wonka Candy division and targeted at tweens with allowance money. The dual-chamber design of its box was driven by research that showed boys preferred pouring the candy into their mouths, while girls tended to put it in their hands.

After initial success in the 1980s, Nerds settled into a middling market status for decades until the introduction of Nerds Gummy Clusters in 2020. In 2021, Nerds Gummy Clusters received free advertising from Kylie Jenner to her 200 million Instagram followers.  A 2024 Super Bowl commercial for Nerds Gummy Clusters featured TikToker Addison Rae.  Annual brand revenue increased from about $40 million in 2018 to more than $500 million in 2024, with Nerds Gummy Clusters accounting for more than 90% of the total.

== Production process ==
The television show &quot;Unwrapped&quot; explains how Nerds are made. A factory worker states, &quot;Basically we start off with a sugar crystal and we just keep coating it with more sugar.&quot; The factory spins huge barrel-like containers of sugar crystals, which receive coats of sugar until the Nerds are formed. Their original color is pure white; they receive their colors in separate barrels. The contents of the barrels are then transferred to boxes, which are divided into two compartments by a vertical partition so each half of the box contains a different flavor. Certain flavor combinations are frequently packaged together, such as grape and strawberry, the most popular pairing in the United States.

The nucleus of each candy is composed of one or more complete sucrose crystals. These optically clear monoclinic crystals are about 0.2–1 mm in length and help define the irregular shape. They are thickly glazed with carnauba wax, which gives them a hard bite and a gloss.

Nerds Gummy Clusters are made by pouring melted gel into molds to form the core. In a massive stainless steel bowl, dots of sugar are spun until &quot;baby Nerds&quot; are created. The gummy balls are then sent tumbling to be coated with baby Nerds.

== Nutritional facts ==
Nerds may contain traces of gluten. The article &quot;Nerds Candy Nutrition&quot; states, &quot;Nerds primarily consist of sugar. The top three ingredients are dextrose, sugar and malic acid. The rest of the candy contains less than 2 percent of corn syrup, artificial flavors, carnauba wax and artificial coloring. The artificial coloring varies by flavor.&quot; The allergy warnings of this candy state that Nerds are created &quot;in a facility that also produces wheat and egg.&quot; The normal serving size is one tablespoon—about 15 grams. (One serving of Nerds is equivalent to 60 calories, mostly from carbohydrates, with little fat or protein.) The Halloween hand-out size is typically , and the larger boxes contain .

== Early competition ==
Nerds were a popular candy in the 1980s, but they had big competitors that included Pop Rocks, Candy Buttons, and Mike and Ike. Nerds also had a close cousin in the 1990s: Dweebs. Dweebs were very similar to Nerds; but they were less sour and bigger in size. One of the most popular differences is that Dweebs contained three flavors instead of two, though the United Kingdom had a box of Nerds with three flavors for a limited time. According to Rob Bricken, &quot;A squishier Nerd with more leg space and a surprise in the middle, Dweebs were more substantial, less sour, and displayed a greater depth and complexity than Nerds.&quot; Dweebs only lasted a very short time on the market, however.

==Varieties and flavors==
Nerds consist of various flavors and colors, ranging from extremely sweet to extremely sour; often, the two flavors in one box will contrast, and a single flavor may even exhibit both extremes. A Nerds breakfast cereal based on the concept appeared in the 1980s with two varieties (Orange and Cherry / Grape and Strawberry), but it had a short lifespan.

Although many other flavors are available, some of the current regular flavors of Nerds include the following:
*Strawberry and Grape (pink and purple)
*Wild Cherry and Watermelon (orange or red and green)
*Double Dipped Lemonade-Wild Cherry and Apple-Watermelon (red and yellow)
*Sour - Lightning Lemon and Amped Apple (yellow and light green)
*Surf &#x27;n Turf - Totally Tropical Punch and Road Rash Raspberry (red and blue)
*Wildberry and Peach (blue and orange)
*Watermelon and Punch and Wildberry (green and blue)
*Mango Chile and Guava (yellow and pink)
*Lime and Pineapple (green and yellow)

===Previous flavors===
* Orange and Cherry (Orange and Red)
* Watermelon and Punch and Grape and Punch (Green and White and Purple and White)
* Watermelon and Rainbow (Green and Mixed Colors)

===Spin-off products===
Willy Wonka has also come up with several spin-off products of Nerds:

* Sour Nerds are big and they usually come in Lightning Lemon and Amped Apple. They are packaged in a regular box. A second flavor—Shocking Strawberry and Electric Blue—was also released.
* Strawberry Giant Chewy Nerds, also known as &quot;Future Nerds&quot;, have a chewy jelly bean center with a bumpy, crunchy Nerd shell. They are the same product as Nerd Jelly Beans, but they are available year-round.
* Nerds Rope consists of gummy string with a variety of Nerds attached to the outside. It comes in original, valentine&#x27;s, berry, and tropical flavors. 
* Rainbow Nerds is a box of regular Nerds with multiple flavors, with no partition or organization.
* Jumbo Nerds is a box of Nerds with multiple flavors—much larger than regular Nerds. The box depicts one jumbo Nerd on one end of a see-saw with several regular-sized Nerds trying to counter its weight.
* Nerds Gum Balls are bubble gum balls filled with multiple flavors of Nerds on the inside.
* Seasonal Nerds are sometimes manufactured for holidays. Flavors may include: 
**Spooky Nerds, a Halloween variety featuring fruit punch (white) and orange flavors.
**Frosty Nerds, a Christmas variety featuring watermelon (green), cherry (red) and fruit punch (white) flavors.
**Valentine Nerds, a Valentine&#x27;s Day variety in a miniature box featuring mixed strawberry (pink) and fruit punch (white) flavors. 
**Hoppin&#x27; Nerds, an Easter variety featuring pink rainbow and blue rainbow flavors.
* Nerds Cereal, a now-discontinued breakfast cereal that, like the candy, featured two separate flavors in a box (Orange and Cherry/Grape and Strawberry). The cereal came with a mail-in offer for a Nerds cereal bowl, which also could be divided in two, like a standard Nerds box.
* Nerds Gum consisted of pieces that looked like regular Nerds, but were actually bubble gum. The box featured a Nerd floating away with a bubble gum bubble coming out of its mouth.
* Dweebs, now discontinued, were a soft, chewy version of Nerds. Released in the early 1990s, Dweebs contained three separate flavors rather than two. Dweebs were available only for a very short time, however.
*Neon Nerds were introduced in 1996 and came in Pinktricity, LightningLime, and Electro Orange flavors. They are still sold in Australia and New Zealand. The LightningLime flavor was only sold in the UK, according to candy expert Jason Liebig.
*Nerd Jelly Beans, produced for Easter, are jelly beans with a coating of carnauba wax, which makes them taste like Nerds.
*Wonkalate, a UK-only raspberry-flavored white chocolate bar that was colored purple, which contained green-colored Nerds marketed as being &quot;snozzberry-flavored&quot; (but were actually mixed fruit-flavored).
**W-egg, a UK-only Creme Egg-like confection resembling a larger, more squat version of a Munchie, made of the same chocolate used in the Wonkalate and also containing &quot;snozzberry&quot; Nerds. It also had a hot-pink colored fondant center. It was available during Easter in 2000.
*Nerd Blizzard, a Nerd milkshake offered from Dairy Queen. Now discontinued, Nerds and soft serve ice cream were not a popular pairing (this combination can still be found at DQs throughout Minnesota, however).
*Candy Nerds Slushes, a variety of the Candy Slushes offered by Sonic that feature Nerds.
*Nerds Gummy Clusters, bite-sized gummy balls coated in Nerds.
*Nerdalicious, a product similar to licorice with Nerds inside it, sold exclusively in the United Kingdom.

Throughout the 1980s, several new flavors of Nerds were introduced from time to time; for example, &quot;Hot and Cool&quot; Nerds (cinnamon and wintergreen flavored), blueberry and raspberry, banana, lemon and lime, and Cherry Cola.

== Reception ==
In 1985, Nerds were named &quot;Candy of the Year&quot; by the National Candy Wholesalers Association. 

In 2025, Nerds spinoff, NERDS Gummy Clusters, won the Product of the Year Canada award.

<text>Esa Jouni Olavi Saarinen (born 27 July 1953 in Hyvinkää, Finland) is a Finnish philosopher who was a professor of applied philosophy at Aalto University and co-director of the Systems Intelligence Research Group, until his retirement in 2021.

Saarinen completed his PhD degree in 1978 at the University of Helsinki, where he has since held a docentship. His extrovert public persona – he became known as the “punk doctor” – was reflected in his lectures at the university, which drew increasingly large audiences until the late 1990s. After failing to get the position of full-time professor at the Department of Philosophy at the University of Helsinki, Saarinen resigned from his lecturer position. Soon afterwards he was appointed professor at Helsinki University of Technology, since then renamed Aalto University.

Saarinen&#x27;s philosophical interests have changed dramatically, from early writings in formal logic, to concerns with existentialism and later to media philosophy. The year 1994 saw the publication of Saarinen&#x27;s best-known non-academic work, Imagologies: Media Philosophy, written jointly with American philosopher Mark C. Taylor.

In addition to academic teaching, Saarinen has also continued his business as a coach for Finnish companies and organisations, promoting a doctrine of self-actualization.

Saarinen is married to Pipsa Pallasvesa and has two sons, Jerome and Oliver, born in 1989.

One of Esa Saarinen&#x27;s former students is the philosopher Pekka Himanen.

Esa Saarinen was stabbed with a knife by a student outside a lecture hall in March 2014. He survived without life-threatening injuries.

<doc id="977774" wikidata="Q2484090" url="?curid=977774" title="Pemberley">
<text>Pemberley is the fictional country estate owned by Fitzwilliam Darcy, the male protagonist in Jane Austen&#x27;s 1813 novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. It is located near the fictional town of Lambton, and believed by some to be based on Lyme Park, south of Disley in Cheshire.

In describing the estate, Austen uses uncharacteristically explicit symbolism to represent the geographical home of the man at the centre of the novel. On first visiting the estate, Elizabeth Bennet is charmed by the beauty of the surrounding countryside, as indeed she is by Mr. Darcy himself. Elizabeth had already rejected Mr. Darcy&#x27;s first proposal by the time she visits Pemberley—it is his letter, the praise of his housekeeper, and his own courteous behaviour at Pemberley that bring about a change in her opinion of Mr. Darcy.

==In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;==

They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place where nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! – Jane Austen (1813)
==In other media==
* Dyrham Park stood in for Pemberley in the 1967 BBC adaptation starring Australian actor Lewis Fiander as Mr. Darcy and Celia Bannerman as Elizabeth Bennet. The last scene of the series shows the married couple looking down at Pemberley.
* Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, England, UK was the setting for Pemberley in the 1980 BBC adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, adapted from the novel by Fay Weldon.
* Lyme Park, near Stockport, was the setting for Pemberley for the 1995 television series of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.
* Chatsworth House was used for the exterior scenes for Joe Wright&#x27;s 2005 film version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. However, Wilton House was used for many of the interior scenes, such as those featuring Georgiana Darcy. The official Chatsworth House website believes that the author was thinking of Chatsworth House when describing Pemberley. Jane Austen explicitly mentions Chatsworth in the novel as one of the great houses Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle visited before Pemberley during their visit north. Chatsworth was again used for exterior, and some interior, scenes for the BBC adaptation of &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot;.
* Harewood House, near Leeds in West Yorkshire, was the setting for Pemberley in the ITV fantasy series &quot;Lost in Austen&quot;. This series was not a direct adaptation of the novel, but the novel provided the majority of the plots, characters and inspiration. Some interior scenes in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; were filmed at Harewood.
* Pemberley Press is the name of the publishing house that Bridget Jones works at in the 2001 film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, in homage to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.
* In &quot;The Lizzie Bennet Diaries&quot;, a vlog-style modern adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, Pemberley Digital is the name of Darcy&#x27;s company. Darcy says Pemberley is the name of the place that his father&#x27;s family comes from in England.
* &quot;Miss Bennet: Christmas at Pemberley&quot; by Lauren Gunderson and Margot Melcon, with characters from Pride and Prejudice, is set at Pemberley.

<text>The Circinus Galaxy (ESO 97-G13) is a Seyfert galaxy in the constellation of Circinus. It is located 4 degrees below the Galactic plane, and, at a distance of , is one of the closest major galaxies to the Milky Way. The galaxy is undergoing tumultuous changes, as rings of gas are likely being ejected from the galaxy. Its outermost ring is 1400 light-years across while the inner ring is 260 light-years across. Although the Circinus galaxy can be seen using a small telescope, it was not noticed until 1977 because it lies close to the plane of the Milky Way and is obscured by galactic dust. The Circinus Galaxy is a Type II Seyfert galaxy and is one of the closest known active galaxies to the Milky Way, though it is probably slightly farther away than Centaurus A.

Circinus Galaxy produced supernova SN 1996cr, which was identified over a decade after it exploded. This supernova event was first observed during 2001 as a bright, variable object in a Chandra X-ray Observatory image, but it was not confirmed as a supernova until years later.

The Circinus Galaxy is one of twelve large galaxies in the &quot;Council of Giants&quot; surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/mnras/stu199&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; One object is possibly a satellite of the Circinus Galaxy, known as HIZOA J1353-58. HIZOA J1353-58 was discovered in a survey of neutral hydrogen (H I) and is located within the Zone of Avoidance.

NuSTAR detected a ULX at the edge of this galaxy, a black hole about 100 times the mass of the Sun.

<doc id="977784" wikidata="Q333225" url="?curid=977784" title="Frank Hornby">
<text>Frank Hornby (15 May 1863 – 21 September 1936) was an English inventor, businessman and politician. He was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, and although he had no formal engineering training, he was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys. He also founded the British toy company Meccano Ltd in 1908, and launched a monthly publication, &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot; in 1916.

Hornby&#x27;s inventions and initiatives made him a millionaire in the 1930s. He entered politics in 1931 when he was elected as a Conservative MP for the Everton constituency. Hornby&#x27;s legacy has persisted long after his death with enthusiasts all over the world still building Meccano models and collecting his toys. The 150th anniversary of Hornby&#x27;s birth was celebrated in Liverpool and Brighton on 15 May 2013.

==Biography==
Born on 15 May 1863 at 77 Copperas Hill, Liverpool, Lancashire, Hornby was the son of John Oswald Hornby, a provision merchant and his wife Martha Hornby (née Thomlinson), though this date has been questioned. It is the date on his birth certificate, but the entry in the family bible in his mother&#x27;s handwriting gives the date as 2 May. At the age of sixteen, Hornby left school and started working as a cashier in his father&#x27;s business. On 15 January 1887 he married a schoolteacher Clara Walker Godefroy, the daughter of a customs officer and they had two sons, Roland and Douglas, and a daughter, Patricia. When his father died in 1899, his father&#x27;s business was closed and Hornby became a bookkeeper for David Hugh Elliot who ran a meat importing business in Liverpool.

After experimenting with new ideas in his home workshop, Hornby began making toys for his sons in 1899 with pieces he cut from sheet metal. He built models of bridges, trucks and cranes, although the pieces they were made from were not interchangeable. The breakthrough came when Hornby realised that if he could make separate, interchangeable parts that could be bolted together, any model could be built from the same components. The key inventive step was the realisation that regular perforations in the structural pieces could be used, not only to join them together with nuts and bolts, but also to journal – act as a bearing for – axles and shafts. This made the construction of complex mechanisms relatively simple. He started making metal strips by hand from copper sheets. The strips were half an inch wide with holes for bolts spaced at half-inch intervals. Initially he made the nuts and bolts himself, but he soon found an alternate source of supply.

By the end of 1900 Hornby had built a set of parts he considered worth marketing. On advice, he patented his invention in January 1901 as &quot;Improvements in Toy or Educational Devices for Children and Young People&quot;, but not without first having to borrow £5 from his employer, David Elliot, to cover the costs.

During 1901 Hornby began looking for companies to manufacture his product, but it was poorly finished and did not attract much attention. Still having to support his family on the small wage he earned, Hornby did not have much time to market his invention. Fortunately, his employer saw potential in what Hornby was doing and offered him some vacant premises next to the office where he worked to pursue his ideas. With this move, Elliot and Hornby became partners.

Hornby now called his construction toy &quot;Mechanics Made Easy&quot; and after receiving a positive endorsement from professor Henry Selby Hele-Shaw, then Head of the Engineering Department at Liverpool University, Hornby managed to secure contracts with outside manufacturers to supply the parts for his construction sets. With the financial assistance of his partner, &quot;Mechanics Made Easy&quot; sets went on sale in 1902.

Each set had only 16 different parts with a leaflet detailing the construction of 12 models. In 1903, 1,500 sets were sold, although no profit was made. New parts were continually being introduced and in 1904, six sets, packed in tin boxes with instruction manuals in French and English, became available. In 1905 two new sets were introduced and in 1906, for the first time, a small profit was made.

By 1907 Hornby&#x27;s part suppliers could not meet the demand. This prompted Hornby to quit his job with Elliot and find suitable premises to begin manufacturing his own parts. He secured a three-year lease on a workshop in Duke Street, by Dukes Terrace in the Rope Walks area of Liverpool, and with the help of a loan granted to Hornby and Elliot for machinery and wages, they were manufacturing their own parts by June 1907.

===Meccano===

In September 1907, Hornby registered his famous &quot;Meccano&quot; trade mark and used this name on all new sets. To raise more capital to invest in a larger factory and plant, a company had to be created. This led to the formation of Meccano Ltd on 30 May 1908. Elliot had decided not to join the new company, leaving Hornby as the sole proprietor. The Meccano factory was relocated to West Derby Road in Liverpool, and in 1910 the famous &quot;MECCANO&quot; logo was commissioned. Meccano Ltd&#x27;s turnover for the 1910 financial year was £12,000.

Meccano was exported to many countries and in 1912, Hornby and his son, Roland, formed Meccano (France) Ltd in Paris to manufacture Meccano. An office was also opened in Berlin, (Germany) and Märklin began to manufacture Meccano under licence. Hornby also started importing clockwork motors from Märklin.

To keep pace with demand, a new factory was built in Binns Road, Liverpool. By September 1914 the Binns Road Factory was in full production and became the company headquarters for over 60 years.

===Other initiatives===
In addition to Meccano, Hornby developed and manufactured a number of other model kits and toys, including:
*1909 – &quot;Hornby System of Mechanical Demonstration&quot;, an educational set.
*1915 – Clockwork lithographed tinplate O gauge trains.
*1920 – The Hornby Clockwork Train (0 gauge), enameled tinplate – later Hornby Series – later Hornby Trains. 
*1934 – Dinky Toys, die-cast miniature model cars and trucks (first introduced under the Hornby name in 1931) .
*1938 – Hornby Dublo model railway system (00 gauge. Introduced after Hornby&#x27;s death).

In 1916, Hornby launched a monthly publication, &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot;, which remained in circulation for over sixty years, and in 1930 he formed the Meccano Guild, an amalgamation of Meccano clubs from all over the world.

===Member of Parliament and final years===
By the 1930s, Hornby had become a millionaire. He owned a mansion Quarry Brook in Maghull (his first house in Maghull was the Hollies in Station Road), and was chauffeured to Binns Road every day by limousine. In 1931 he entered politics when he was elected as a Conservative MP for the Everton constituency. He left the running of the company to his co-Directors and staff. But he did not stay in politics long, standing down at the 1935 General Election.

Hornby died of a chronic heart condition complicated by diabetes in Maghull, near Liverpool, Lancashire, on 21 September 1936. He is buried in the grounds of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Maghull. His elder son Roland took over as chairman of Meccano Ltd.

Hornby&#x27;s legacy lives on today with thousands of enthusiasts all over the world still building Meccano models, running Hornby Train sets and collecting Dinky Toys. In his homeplace of Maghull there is a local Wetherspoons pub named after him, &quot;The Frank Hornby&quot;.

==150th anniversary==

The 150th anniversary of Frank Hornby&#x27;s birth fell on 15 May 2013, and festivities were held by the National Museums Liverpool and the Frank Hornby Charitable Trust, Maghull, and by the Brighton Toy and Model Museum.

Google also celebrated the 150th anniversary with a Google Doodle on their UK homepage on 15 May 2013.

<text>Frederick Horsman Varley (January 2, 1881 – September 8, 1969) was a member of the Canadian Group of Seven.

==Career==
===Early life===
Varley was born in Sheffield, England, in 1881, the son of Lucy (Barstow) and Samuel James Smith Varley the 7th. He began his art training there in 1892, at the age of 11, studied art in Sheffield (1892-1899) and attended the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Antwerp (1900-1902), Belgium, while he worked on the docks. He emigrated to Canada in 1912 on the advice of another Sheffield native (and future Group of Seven member), Arthur Lismer, and found work at the Grip Ltd. design firm in Toronto, Ontario and afterwards at Rous &amp; Mann.

===War artist===

Beginning in January 1918, he served in the First World War with C.W. Simpson, J.W. Beatty and Maurice Cullen. Varley came to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook, who arranged for him to be commissioned as an official war artist. He accompanied Canadian troops in the &quot;Hundred Days&quot; offensive from Amiens, France to Mons, Belgium. His paintings of combat are based on his experiences at the front. Although he had been enthusiastic to travel to France as a war artist, he became deeply disturbed by what he saw, saying:
Varley&#x27;s &quot;Some Day the People Will Return&quot;, shown at Burlington House in London and at the Canadian War Memorials Exhibition, is a large canvas depicting a war-ravaged cemetery, suggesting that even the dead cannot escape the destruction.

In Varley&#x27;s painting &quot;For What?&quot; (1918), a single gravedigger takes a rest from his labours, a cart full of bodies beside him. It is one of the few official Canadian First World War paintings that does not hide the reality of battlefield death in images of ruins, blasted trees, and battle detritus.

===Group of Seven===

In 1920, he was a founding member of the Group of Seven. He was the only original member of the Group of Seven to specialize in portraiture, but he also painted landscapes. Varley&#x27;s major contribution to art is his work with the Group of Seven and his portraits.

===Later life and death===
After living in Ontario for a number of years, Varley moved to Vancouver, BC in 1926 where he became Head of the Department of Drawing and Painting at the School of Decorative and Applied Arts in Vancouver at the invitation of Charles Hepburn Scott. He remained in this position from 1926 until 1933.

In British Columbia, he painted images of mountains and mountainsides, drawing upon several influences from Chinese painting to William Turner and Samuel Palmer. He left in 1936 due to his experiences with depression, and two years later joined fellow artist Terry M. Shortt, the Royal Ontario Museum ornithologist, on a trip to the Arctic in 1938. In 1954, along with a handful of artists including Eric Aldwinckle, he visited the Soviet Union on the first cultural exchange of the Cold War.

For the last twelve years of his life, Varley lived in Markham, Ontario with Kathleen and Donald McKay. Kathleen nurtured Varley’s later artistic career by setting up a studio for him in the basement of her ancestral home, now the McKay Art Centre located at 197 Main Street Unionville. After Varley’s death in 1969, Kathleen promised to donate her considerable collection of works by Varley and his contemporaries to Markham, to be housed in a gallery suitable for their display and preservation. That promise resulted in the building of the Varley Art Gallery of Markham, which opened in 1997. He was buried alongside other members of the Original Seven at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection grounds in Kleinburg, Ontario.

==Recognition==
Varley was an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
In Unionville, the Varley Art Gallery of Markham is named after him, as is &quot;Fred Varley&quot; Drive, a two-lane residential street. Varley lived nearby at the Salem-Eckhardt House from 1952 to 1969.

On 6 May 1994 Canada Post issued &#x27;Vera (detail), F.H. Varley, 1931&#x27; in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on an oil painting &quot;Vera&quot;, (1931) by Frederick Horsman Varley in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. The 88¢ stamps are perforated 14 x 14.5 mm and were printed by Leigh-Mardon Pty Limited.

His place in the art history of Canada is verified by the government&#x27;s decision to reproduce his self-portrait as a 17-cent postage stamp. On 22 May 1981 Canada Post issued &#x27;Frederick H. Varley, Self Portrait&#x27; designed by Pierre Fontaine. The stamps are based on an oil painting &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, (circa 1945) by Frederick Horsman Varley in the Hart House Permanent Collection, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario. The 17¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

Varley has been designated as an Historic Person in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations.

<text>The Ozama River () is a river in the Dominican Republic. It rises in the Loma Siete Cabezas mountain in the Sierra de Yamasá mountain range, close to the town of Villa Altagracia.

==History==
In 1498, Bartolome Colon had a fort built on the Ozama River delta, which would later become the first permanent European settlement in the New World (Santo Domingo). The estuary at that time, &quot;teemed with fish and where the Indians raised cassava and yams,&quot; according to Floyd.

==Course==

The river flows before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. At the end of the journey it bisects the capital, Santo Domingo, into eastern and western halves. The three main tributaries of the Ozama are the Isabela River, the Sabita River and the Yabacao River.

The Ozama&#x27;s basin is the fourth largest in the Dominican Republic. The river has several tributaries, with a combined area of . The river basin has an annual precipitation of to per year.

==Pollution==
The Ozama River is heavily polluted. It is constantly affected by the slums on its shores and the factories that dump their waste into it. It is one of the main causes of pollution on the coastline of Santo Domingo. In August 2020, The Ocean Cleanup organization deployed an Interceptor Original, one of their solar-powered, automated systems, to help combat the flow of plastics and trash into the Caribbean Sea.

<text>HCG 87 is a compact group of galaxies listed in the Hickson Compact Group Catalogue. This group is about 400 million light-years away in the constellation Capricornus. 
The group distinguishes itself as one of the most compact groups of galaxies, hosting two active galactic nuclei and a starburst among its three members, all of which show signs of interaction. This interaction, which astronomers have called visually, and scientifically, intriguing is being examined to understand the influence of active nuclei on star formation histories.

<doc id="977804" wikidata="Q695002" url="?curid=977804" title="Nikoloz Muskhelishvili">
<text>Nikoloz (Niko) Muskhelishvili (; – 15 July 1976) was a Soviet Georgian mathematician, physicist and engineer who was one of the founders and first President (1941–1972) of the Georgian SSR Academy of Sciences (now Georgian National Academy of Sciences).

==Life and career==
Muskhelishvili was born on in Tbilisi, then part of the Russian Empire into a family of engineers. He graduated from local grammar school in 1909 and afterwards from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Saint Petersburg in 1914. Immediately after his graduation he became head of Applied Mathematics of the same faculty and in 1918 passed the exam for the master&#x27;s degree. His first scientific magazine was published already earlier in 1915 containing a number of issues on elasticity theory. From 1917 to 1920 he worked as assistant director of the Petrograd University and also taught mathematics in other institutions in Saint Petersburg. At request of the short-lived Democratic Republic of Georgia he moved back to his native country in 1920 in order to organize the establishment of a national scientific school. There Muskhelishvili conducted lessons in the Tbilisi State University and Polytechnic Institute as an assistant professor and from 1922 to 1938 as head professor. After the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, Muskhelishvili was allowed to carry on his works in the Transcaucasian Soviet Academy of Sciences and since 1933 was corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He became a member of the CPSU in 1940.

In 1941 based on the former Georgian Academy of Sciences a new USSR Academy of Sciences was established by the Georgian SSR and Muskhelishvili got elected as its first president and academician. Simultaneously he also became director of the Tbilisi Mathematics Institute named after AM Rasmadze, and held that position until his death in 1976.

From 1956 to 1976 Muskhelishvili was chairman of the National Committee of the USSR on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (established by the Decree of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences). Since 1957 he was also member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences. In 1972 due to health problems the professor resigned from the post of president of the Georgian SSR Academy of Sciences but in recognition for his outstanding achievements and services was elected honorary president of the academy. He was also an academician and honorary professor of the Academies of Sciences of the Armenian and Azerbaijani SSRs since 1961. Muskhelishvili was an honorary member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences since 1952, Polish Academy of Sciences since 1960 and the Berlin Academy of Sciences since 1967. He also held the position of deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in eight convocations from 1937 to 1974.

Nikoloz Muskhelishvili died on 15 July 1976 in Tbilisi and is buried in the Mtatsminda Pantheon.

==Contributions to science==
Muskhelishvili conducted fundamental research on the theories of physical elasticity, Integral equations, Boundary value problems and other. He was one of the first to apply the theory of functions of complex variables to the problems of elasticity theories, proposing a number of techniques that have been successfully implemented in numerous areas of mathematics, theoretical physics and mechanics. His works solved all major problems of the Plane Elasticity Theory opening a wide class of domains reducing the plane problem to finite systems of linear algebraic equations c singular kernels. He is also credited with major contributions to the theory of linear boundary value problems for analytic functions and one-dimensional integral equations. Muskhelishvili is the author of various scientific articles, monographs and textbooks on mathematics which have been used by universities since their publishing. Highest regarded ones are the monographs &quot;Some basic problems of the mathematical theory of elasticity&quot; (1933) and &quot;Singular Integral Equations&quot; (1947).

===Involvement in military research===
During World War II Muskhelishvili was responsible for retargeting the preoccupation of the Academy of Science to national defense. He completed a series of research, experimental and theoretical work in different areas of applied mathematics, physics and mechanics, which all had great practical importance and decisive impact on the development of a range of military hardware during and after the war. However, the exact scale is unknown and classified. His achievements and involvement in the defense sphere earned him several awards, including the Medal &quot;For the Defence of the Caucasus&quot;. He got also awarded for the launch of the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite into space in 1961 on which development he had contributed as well. Muskhelishvili was a renowned specialist in engineering able to apply a lot of his theories and solutions, including torsion bar suspension for tracked vehicles such as tanks. Most of his research, theories, and ideas were considered and implemented for the development of certain vehicles during the Cold War, some of which already originated from his earlier theoretical work during World War II, on the elasticity of specific material under specific circumstances such as different temperature, weight, composition etc. His work practically applied to anything from land-based vehicles to aircraft, rockets, and satellites.

<text>The Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot, and Service Pilot badges were qualification badges of the United States Army Air Forces issued during the years of World War II to identify a rating in one of three specialized, limited-duty pilot categories whose selection and training differed from that of the traditional military pilot.

The badges denoting these respective ratings were similar to the standard USAAF Pilot Badge with one of three upper-case letters superimposed upon the badge&#x27;s shield (formally termed escutcheon) denoting the wearer&#x27;s rating: G (Glider Pilot), L (Liaison Pilot), or S (Service Pilot).

The individual awarded these ratings were selected on the basis of civil flying experience and pilot certificates gained prior to their induction into the U.S. Army. Further training tended to be focused within a narrowly-defined set of missions for which their previously-acquired skills and experience were considered directly applicable. In addition, less-restrictive medical standards and broader age limits applied at initial entry.

== US Army Air Forces Flying Medical Classes Compared ==

In contrast to the Aviation Cadet Training Program, medical standards for initial entry into the Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot or Service Pilot ratings were less restrictive. As opposed to the USAAF Class I medical examination required of all prospective Aviation Cadets, prospective Glider and Liaison Pilots meeting only USAAF Class II standards were allowed into those respective training programs, while the still less restrictive Class III standards were permitted for entrants into the Service Pilot rating.

The most significant difference in standards between each medical class was visual acuity (all values for each eye separately):

* Class I. Distant and near: 20/20 or better uncorrected. Applied to applicants for the Aviation Cadet Training Program only (effective 1942, the Class II medical below was allowed for Aviation Cadets classified for Navigator and Bombardier training only).
* Class II. Distant and near: 20/40 (later 20/100) uncorrected, correctable with spectacles to 20/20 or better. Applied to rated Pilots with less than 1500 hours flying time, Navigators, Bombardiers, Liaison Pilots and Glider Pilots.
* Class III. Distant: 20/100 (later 20/200) uncorrected, correctable with spectacles to 20/20 or better. Near: correctable to 20/20 or better. Applied to Senior Pilots, Command Pilots, Service Pilots and Senior Service Pilots, Flight Surgeons, Technical Observers, and most Aircrew Member ratings.

N.B.: For Class II and III personnel, correction to 20/20 or better in each eye separately with ordinary spectacles was required in all cases, and no other visual or ocular deficiencies were allowed. Changes to the more permissive minimum uncorrected acuity requirements (listed in parentheses) were made in June 1942.

N.B.: USAAF medical examination Classes I, II and III differed &quot;significantly&quot; in purpose and scope from those in use within military and civil aviation today, and do not directly correspond to any current USAF, US Army or FAA standard titled under the same or similar terminology. &quot;This information is for historical reference only&quot;.

== Age Limits ==

Age restrictions were also more lenient in the case of applicants for these ratings. For comparison (all limits inclusive):

* Aviation Cadet: 18 to 26 years
* Glider Pilot: 18 to 35 years
* Liaison Pilot: 18 to 35 years
* Service Pilot: 18 to 45 years

==Glider Pilot==
&quot;Glider Pilot&quot; wings were awarded to soldiers who completed training as pilots of military gliders (MOS 1026). The wings were issued initially during the Second World War. The final class of Glider Pilots ever to be trained received their wings in January 1945 at South Plains Army Airfield, near Lubbock, Texas. These wings should not be confused with the Glider Badge which was created in 1944 to recognize glider-borne ground troops (mostly Infantry, but also various supporting arms) of U.S. Airborne Divisions, who rode into combat as passengers.

The success of German glider-borne forces early in World War II catapulted the Army Air Forces into a glider program in February 1941. In December 1941, plans called for training 1,000 AAF glider pilots, but eventually about 5,500 received their wings. Most Glider Pilots came from the enlisted ranks — all were volunteers. Junior enlisted personnel trained in the pay grade of Sergeant during training, while NCOs and above trained in-grade. Upon graduation, Sergeants and below would be promoted to Staff Sergeant, whereas those already in the grade of Staff Sergeant or higher retained their current grade. After Nov. 21, 1942, all enlisted graduates were appointed as Flight Officers — equal to the then existing rank of Warrant Officer Junior Grade (WO 1) — upon completing Advanced Glider Training.

Initially, applicants for Glider Pilot training had to meet the following requirements:

* Age 18 to 35 years
* Pass AAF Class I or II flying medical examination
* Score at least 110 on the Army AGCT Test, or at least 65 on the Aviation Cadet Mental Screening Test
* Have prior flying experience meeting one or more of the following criteria:
** Hold a currently effective civilian airman certificate in the grade of private pilot or higher, or
** Held a lapsed airman certificate, provided that such certificate did not lapse prior to 1 January 1941, or
** Completed 200 or more previous glider flights, or
** Previously eliminated from military or naval pilot training, provided at least 50 hours had been logged as principal pilot (solo or performing duties of first-pilot under supervision)and/or as student pilot on military or naval aircraft.

Effective 12 June 1942, individuals with no previous flying experience were also accepted into glider training. Individuals meeting the experience criteria listed above were classified as &quot;Class A Students&quot;, and all others as &quot;Class B Students&quot;. Several critical changes were introduced into the training program during 1942-43 (as described in the next two paragraphs), however ground training included practical instruction in basic infantry skills in addition to the normal aviation ground school subjects throughout.

===Glider Pilot Training===
April 1941 to June 1942

The USAAF&#x27;s Glider Pilot Training Program was in its embryonic stage. Several experimental courses were conducted during this period, using two-place sailplanes acquired commercially. Extensive use was made of civilian instructors, and of facilities and aircraft at civilian soaring clubs and flight schools. The sailplanes used were optimized for long-duration, unpowered soaring flight however, and did not adequately simulate the flight characteristics of the cargo gliders under development. This resulted in several significant changes to the training program effective 15 June 1942.

15 June 1942 to 13 September 1942

Glider Pilot Training was divided into two principal stages: Preliminary and a combined Elementary-Advanced stage. For Class A students, Preliminary lasted four weeks and included 30 hours of dual and solo training on liaison (L-series) aircraft (e.g.: Piper Cub, various Taylorcraft and Stinson types), with particular emphasis on steep gliding descents, approaches and precision landings without power (&quot;dead-stick&quot; landings).

Class B students underwent a somewhat longer Preliminary phase, itself divided into two further phases: Phase I, of five weeks&#x27; duration and consisting of 40 hours dual and solo flying on primary trainer (PT-series) or liaison (L-series) aircraft, emphasizing basic aircraft handling, and Phase II, a further two weeks and 15 hours of flight time emphasizing &quot;dead-stick&quot; landings.

Training for Class A and Class B students merged at the beginning of the Elementary-Advanced stage, consisting of one week and eight flight hours on two- or three-place training gliders — typically Aeronca TG-5 and similar aircraft — followed by another week and a further eight hours on Waco CG-4 cargo gliders. Total training time was typically 46 flight hours (six weeks) for Class A students and 71 flight hours (nine weeks) for Class B students.

14 September 1942 to 26 February 1943

The Glider Pilot training syllabus followed a progression of Preliminary, Elementary, Basic and Advanced phases, with Class A and Class B students training together under a common syllabus from the commencement of the Elementary phase. Preliminary was attended only by the Class B students, was four weeks in duration and included 30 hours dual and solo flying much the same as earlier classes. Elementary was also four weeks long, with a further 30 hours on the same trainers as flown in the Preliminary phase, but with emphasis on &quot;dead-stick&quot; landings. A Basic phase was introduced after Elementary, lasted another four weeks and included 30 hours on TG-5, TG-6 and/or TG-8 training gliders. The Advanced phase until 21 December 1942 was a four-week period of training, with a further 15 flying hours on training gliders mastering low-approach and &quot;blitz&quot; landings (as used in combat). Beginning 21 December 1942, this phase was reduced to two weeks in length and consisted of eight flying hours on CG-4 cargo gliders.

===Glider Pilot Duties===
Glider Pilots deployed under USAAF&#x27;s Troop Carrier Command, and were tasked to deliver personnel and cargo deep into enemy-held territory aboard cargo gliders designed especially for that purpose. Gliders such as the U.S.-built Waco CG-4 or the British-designed Airspeed Horsa AS.51/58 were towed to their destinations by multi-engine cargo transports — most commonly the C-47 — then released directly overhead of their landing zones. Glider Pilots would execute a steep, rapid descent from the moment of tow release, arresting their descent rate and airspeed only in the final seconds prior to touchdown. Ingress on-tow into enemy airspace was typically executed at less than 1000 feet above ground level (AGL), often at night and/or in marginal weather, and frequently under severe enemy small-arms and anti-aircraft artillery fire. Wake turbulence generated by the tow-planes&#x27; wingtips and propellers coupled with low-level atmospheric turbulence typically resulted in an extremely rough ride, and many of the glider-borne troops suffered airsickness.

Commissioned officers holding the Glider Pilot rating were eligible to command flying units equipped with gliders only. Effective 4 February 1943, rated Glider Pilots were authorized to pilot liaison aircraft of 180 horsepower or less and to perform the same duties as Liaison Pilots.

==Liaison Pilot==
The &quot;Liaison Pilot Badge&quot; was presented to enlisted military pilots of MOS 772 (officers holding the Liaison Pilot rating held the MOS Code 1981 - Air Observation Pilot): &quot;Pilots and maintains a small liaison airplane of 175 horsepower or less for purposes of ferrying officers, taking observers on observation missions, or transporting small amounts of critical materiel. Inspects and performs minor maintenance on airplane to which assigned.&quot;, and usually assigned to Liaison Squadrons of the USAAF and to Aviation Sections of Army Ground Forces units at the Division level and above (e.g.: a Divisional Artillery HQ would include a small Aviation Section). A minority of Liaison Pilots held commissioned rank; these were normally Field Artillery officers from Army Ground Forces, fully trained as artillery forward observers. Commissioned and flight officer Liaison Pilots performed substantially the same flying duties as their enlisted counterparts, and were eligible to command flying units equipped with L-series (liaison) aircraft only.
===Liaison Pilot Training===
Applicants for Liaison Pilot duty were drawn from the following sources:

* Washouts from the Basic and Advanced phases of pilot training under the Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF) or Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN). In similar manner to the Glider Pilots, applicants in this category were required to have passed Primary phase and have logged at least 50 hours of student pilot time (dual, solo or a combination thereof) on military or naval aircraft. Individuals who had finished Primary but washed out from a later phase were often given the option to transition to the Liaison Pilot or Glider Pilot rating, depending upon needs of the service, hence both were often considered &quot;second chance&quot; ratings.
* The Field Artillery School, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. These were typically Field Artillery officers (and occasionally enlisted personnel) who had already been trained as forward observers. Those not possessing a private (or higher) pilot rating acquired in civil life or 50 hours of previous military or civilian pilot experience were given an elementary course of some 40 to 60 hours on L- or PT-series aircraft (similar to that given Class B students in the Glider Pilot program) before progressing to mission-specific Liaison Pilot training.
* Graduates of the Civilian Pilot Training Program. This course was considered to be equivalent in depth and scope to Elementary or Primary Flying Training under the USAAF and US Navy programs.
* Direct assignment of USAAF personnel currently rated as Pilots (including Service Pilots). This appears to have been a less commonplace source, and anecdotal indications from the relevant literature suggest they had usually volunteered for this duty.
* Civilian pilot volunteers. A private pilot certificate (or higher) and a minimum or 40 hours of flight time were required. Individuals falling short of the experience requirements demanded for the Service Pilot rating were often accepted as Liaison Pilots instead.

Liaison Pilot School was conducted by the Department of Air Training of the Field Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. The course placed particular emphasis on short-field and soft-/rough-field takeoffs and landings over obstacles, and low-altitude navigation. Their duties included transportation of troops and supplies, medical evacuation, aerial photography, and low-level reconnaissance. Graduates received Liaison Pilot wings. Personnel trained in-grade, with enlisted students being promoted to Staff Sergeant until September 1942, after which graduates were appointed as Flight Officers.

===Liaison Pilot Duties===
Liaison pilots flew light single-engine aircraft in direct support of Army Ground Forces units. Commissioned officers holding the Liaison Pilot Rating were eligible to command flying units equipped with liaison (L-series) aircraft only.

Effective 4 February 1943, rated Glider Pilots were authorized to pilot liaison aircraft of 180 horsepower or less and to perform the same duties as Liaison Pilots.

===Notable former Liaison Pilots===
* Charles &quot;Bazooka Charlie&quot; Carpenter, history teacher, destroyed six German tanks from a Piper L-4
* Mayhew Foster, transported Hermann Göring from Germany to Austria for interrogation.
* Rush H. Limbaugh, Jr., father of broadcasting personality Rush H. Limbaugh III, commanded 25th Liaison Squadron
* Welton I. Taylor (Ph.D.), African-American microbiologist, author of &quot;Two Steps to Glory&quot; (2012, Winning Strategy Press, )
* John Thornton Walker, personal pilot for Gen. Mark W. Clark

== Service Pilot ==
Service pilots performed non-combat flying duties, including instruction, outside the theaters of operation.

An image of the Service Pilot badge remains shown (&quot;at right&quot;) pending completion of new articles for all three ratings.

==Postwar (1945-1947)==
Following the close of World War II, these pilot badges fell into disuse and there were no further issuances. With the creation of the U.S. Air Force, these three aeronautical ratings became obsolete.

===Glider Pilot Legacy===

The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Soaring Instructor Pilots wear the Glider Pilot wings in honor of the WWII Glider Pilots, by permission of the National WW2 Glider Pilots&#x27; Association and the Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy.

The following NASA astronauts have been inducted by the National WW2 Glider Pilots&#x27; Association as Honorary Members:

* Deke Slayton (former WW2-era USAAF B-25 and A-26 pilot, ASTP Docking Module Pilot, former Chief Astronaut)
* Fred W. Haise (Apollo 13 Lunar Module Pilot, Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests)
* Joseph H. Engle (X-15 test pilot, Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests)
* C. Gordon Fullerton (Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests)
* Richard H. Truly (Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests)
* John W. Young (STS-1 Commander)
* Robert L. Crippen (STS-1 Pilot)

WW2 era Glider Pilots invited to fly the Space Shuttle Orbiter simulator at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center have reportedly completed every simulated landing accurately and correctly on the first attempt.

The Civil Air Patrol awards a Glider Pilot Badge of its own — having a somewhat differing wing and escutcheon design while retaining the letter G — to its members who hold an FAA pilot certificate (private or higher) with a glider category rating and have passed a CAP/USAF mandated written and flight examination on gliders.

===Liaison Pilot Legacy===

Following the USAAF&#x27;s separation in 1947 to become the U.S. Air Force, the Liaison Pilots embedded with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Field Artillery battalions remained part of the Army, forming the nucleus of what would evolve into today&#x27;s U.S. Army Aviation Branch. What was once the Liaison Pilot rating has long since evolved, further expanding into the Army Aviator qualification of today&#x27;s Army. The modern Airborne Forward Air Controller (FAC) role has its roots in the role of the Liaison Pilots of the WW2 era, and continues to be employed on modern airframes in the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps alike. In addition, many foreign military air arms developed their own FAC capability in similar fashion during and after the WW2 era.

<doc id="977817" wikidata="Q6537524" url="?curid=977817" title="Lex Banning">
<text>Arthur Alexander Banning (1921–1965) was an Australian lyric poet. 
Disabled from birth by cerebral palsy, he was unable to speak clearly or to write with a pen. &quot;Yet he overcame his handicap to produce poems which were often hauntingly beautiful and frequently ironic, and gave to other, younger poets a strong sense of the importance and value of their calling&quot;. Such younger poets included Clive James, Les Murray and Geoffrey Lehmann.

==Early life==

===A note on sources===

By good fortune, one of Banning&#x27;s closest friends was the late Richard Appleton (&quot;Appo&quot;), a bohemian writer and &quot;raconteur&quot; who met the poet in Sydney&#x27;s Lincoln coffee lounge, about 1950. Appleton later became editor-in-chief of the &quot;Australian Encyclopaedia&quot; and, in 1983, was co-editor with Alex Galloway of the posthumous Banning collection &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot; which includes reliable biographical information. In writing this, Appleton received the benefit of access to a collection of letters in the possession of Dr Anne Banning.

===Birth and disability===
Lex Banning was born in Sydney on 27 June 1921. His mother was half-Swedish, half Scots. His father (who died when Lex was aged four) was Belgian. His disability was cerebral palsy of a type brought about by insufficiency of oxygen in the bloodstream during or soon after birth. Though this resulted in little or no intellectual impairment, he was afflicted by involuntary movements and poor co-ordination of arms, neck and face, because of which his speech was laboured and hard to understand. The disabilities were ultimately no barrier to effective communication nor to the respect and admiration of people who knew him.

===Education and early career===
The family home was in the Sydney suburb of Punchbowl and Lex attended ordinary state primary and secondary schools through which he acquired superior reading skills and was introduced to encyclopaedias. Though denied a full secondary education, at the age of sixteen he was found a job at the Sydney Observatory. There, he learned to type and was able to qualify for admittance to the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University as an unmatriculated student in 1944. He graduated in 1948 with honours in English and history. He was an active and enthusiastic participant in university affairs, including writing for and editing university publications. A poem of his, &quot;1946&quot;, appeared in the 1946 university Arts Society annual &quot;Arna&quot;.

==Later career and associations==
Later, Banning worked as a librarian at the Spastic Centre while also writing for print, radio, film and television. He was a regular associate of Sydney Push and media personalities including close friend and biographer Richard Appleton, Joy Anderson, Robert Hughes, Piers Bourke, John Croyston, Mike and Marjorie Hourihan and Brian Jenkins. Accomplished jazz musician Ray Price and his distinguished wife Nadine Amadio were also close friends.

==Poetry==
For Lex Banning, the fundamental task of poetry was compression, to which end the poet&#x27;s skills and artifices were instrumental. He greatly admired the Japanese &quot;haiku&quot; form and its supreme exponent Matsuo Bashō and the Alexandrian Greek poet C. P. Cavafy. To a lecturer who described poetry as &quot;not the wine but the brandy of literature&quot;, Banning sternly interjected: &quot;Not the brandy ... the &quot;cognac&quot;!&quot; For notwithstanding his own physical disability, Banning was the toughest of critics and no respecter of personalities. His acerbic wit was frequently expressed in blunt conversation, and some of his satirical verse did not bear publication for that reason.

Galloway observes that &quot;the purity of the poem remains his concern as he expunges the element of self-expression in favour of the universal&quot; and invites consideration of these lines from &quot;The Dark Soul&quot; (1951):

The dark soul goes lonely,&lt;BR&gt;
it seeks, but cannot find&lt;BR&gt;
its heart&#x27;s desire among the whirling&lt;BR&gt;
planets of the mind.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
For mind is as a universe,&lt;BR&gt;
a bounded, boundless place,&lt;BR&gt;
but a prison to the dark soul&lt;BR&gt;
that never finds its grace;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
not though it search for ever,&lt;BR&gt;
or the small space of a breath,&lt;BR&gt;
for the soul is immortal,&lt;BR&gt;
and what it seeks is death.
Galloway concludes: &quot;[I]n compiling this collection, I have come to understand his appeal. His sculptured verse is wrought from figures of the past, from acute seeing in the now, from awareness of the significance of shadows which give meaning and dimension to the structure of images. You may hear the voice of thought, see the vision of clear sight, feel the brooding presence of an entity beyond the immediate grasp of the mind, and glimpse the monstrous and the beautiful apprehension allowed to a poet&quot;.

==Last years==
In 1962, he travelled to London and married Australian paediatrician Anne Ferry. Through senior medical contacts who admired his poetry, Banning was invited to visit the Aegean Islands aboard a luxury yacht and develop his interest in palaeontology and his love of the work of Constantine P. Cavafy. However, the marriage foundered and Banning returned to Sydney in 1964, to live alone in a small flat at Darlinghurst. He became depressed and unwell before his sudden death less than a year later on 2 November 1965.

<doc id="977822" wikidata="Q209516" url="?curid=977822" title="Eurasian harvest mouse">
<text>The harvest mouse (Micromys minutus) is a small rodent native to Europe and Asia. It is typically found in fields of cereal crops, such as wheat and oats, in reed beds and in other tall ground vegetation, such as long grass and hedgerows. It has reddish-brown fur with white underparts and a naked, highly prehensile tail, which it uses for climbing. It is the smallest European rodent; an adult may weigh as little as . It eats chiefly seeds and insects, but also nectar and fruit. Breeding nests are spherical constructions carefully woven from grass and attached to stems well above the ground.

==History==
The genus &quot;Micromys&quot; most likely evolved in Asia and is closely related to the long-tailed climbing mouse (&quot;Vandeleuria&quot;) and the pencil-tailed tree mouse (&quot;Chiropodomys&quot;). &quot;Micromys&quot; first emerged in the fossil record in the late Pliocene, with &quot;Micromys minutus&quot; being recorded from the Early Pleistocene in Germany. They underwent a reduction in range during glacial periods, and were confined to areas in Europe that were free of ice. During the mid-Pleistocene, &quot;Micromys minutus&quot; specimens also lived in parts of Asia. This suggests that they spread towards Asia when the ice sheets started to melt. Other evidence suggests that &quot;Micromys minutus&quot; could have been introduced accidentally through agricultural activities during Neolithic times.

Before the harvest mouse had been formally described, Gilbert White reported their nests in Selborne, Hampshire:

They never enter into houses; are carried into ricks and barns with the sheaves; abound in harvest; and build their nests amidst the straws of the corn above the ground, and sometimes in thistles. They breed as many as eight at a litter, in a little round nest composed of the blades of grass or wheat. One of these nests I procured this autumn, most artificially platted, and composed of the blades of wheat; perfectly round, and about the size of a cricket-ball. It was so compact and well-filled, that it would roll across the table without being discomposed, though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind.

Tennis balls used in play at Wimbledon have been recycled to create artificial nests for harvest mice.

==Description==

The harvest mouse ranges from long, and its tail from long; it weighs from , or about half the weight of the house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;). Its eyes and ears are relatively large. It has a small nose, with short, stubble-like whiskers, and thick, soft fur, somewhat thicker in winter than in summer.

The upper part of the body is brown, sometimes with a yellow or red tinge; the under-parts range from white to cream coloured. It has a prehensile tail which is usually bicoloured and furless at the tip. The mouse&#x27;s rather broad feet are adapted specifically for climbing, with a somewhat opposable, large outermost toe, allowing it to grip stems with each hindfoot and its tail, thus freeing the mouse&#x27;s forepaws for food collection. Its tail is also used for balance.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat and distribution ===

The harvest mouse is common in all east coast counties of England, reaching the North York Moors. It also inhabits less favourable habitats, such as woodlands and forests in the west.

Harvest mice reside in a large variety of habitats, from hedgerows to railway banks. Harvest mice seem to have an affinity for all types of cereal heads, except for maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;). Harvest mice typically like using monocotyledons for their nest-building, especially the common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;) and Siberian iris (&quot;Iris sibirica&quot;). Most harvest mice prefer wetlands for their nesting habitats.

Harvest mice in Japan like making wintering nests near the ground from grasses that are dried, which indicates that they require vegetative cover in the winter, as well as in the warmer seasons. Grasslands with a mix of perennials and annual grasses are required to balance the increases in nesting periods and the mice&#x27;s need to secure nutrients. Habitat selection might be the result of differences in the structure of the landscape of grasslands and wetlands in the area.

=== Behaviour ===
Harvest mice have a short lactation period of 15–16 days. They spend most of their life in long grass and other vegetation such as reedbeds, rushes, ditches, cereals and legumes. They are very skilled at climbing among grasses due to their tail. They grasp leaves and stems with their feet and tail, which leaves their hands free for other tasks. These tasks can include grooming and feeding. Harvest mice have a prehensile tail that functions as an extra limb during climbing. During the lactation period, the pups are able to climb a vertical bar by the time they first emerge from their nest. At 3–7 days they learn hand grasping, and at 6–9 days they learn food grasping. Between 6–11 days, they adopt a quadrupedal stance, and at 10-11 there is tail prehension, and righting at 10–12 days. The righting response in harvest mice develops earlier, but takes longer to master than the other skills the pups learn. They cannot climb horizontally by the time they are weaned, suggesting that horizontal climbing is not as essential as vertical climbing.

=== Predators ===
Their predators include domesticated cats, barn owls, tawny owls, long-eared owls, little owls, and kestrels.

== Reproduction ==
In most rodent species, females prefer familiar males to unfamiliar ones. The adaptive preference of mating with familiar males is not uncommon as familiarity is a proxy for quality that is seen in many solitary animals. Harvest mice are thought to be solitary, and the females prefer for familiar males over unfamiliar. There is no size dimorphism between the sexes so the females are considered dominant over the males. Females do not show interest in the male&#x27;s odor. When females are in oestrus they spend more time with familiar males, and prefer the one that is heavier. While in dioestrus, the female spends more time with unfamiliar males.

In most years in Britain, harvest mice build their first breeding nests in June or July; occasional nests are built earlier in April or early May. They prefer building their breeding nests above ground. In Russia, harvest mouse breeding occurs in November and December in cereal ricks, buckwheat, and other cereal heads.

== Conservation ==
Due to their habitat, in Japan harvest mice are threatened by a number of anthropogenic effects such as farming, pesticide use, crop rotation, habitat destruction, fragmentation, and wetland draining. Grasslands in that country are rapidly decreasing in area, and are also becoming increasingly fragmented.

The first survey of the harvest mouse in Britain was conducted by the Mammal Society in the 1970s, and later followed up by the National Harvest Mouse survey in the late 1990s. These surveys indicated that harvest mouse nests were on a decline with 85% of the suitable habitat no longer available for the mice.

As of 2019 the harvest mouse is protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 and the UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework: Implementation Plan.

<text>The Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) is a registered charity (number 1037771) and the leading professional body in the United Kingdom concerned solely with taxation. The CIOT deals with all aspects of direct and indirect taxation.

==Activities==
The primary purpose of the CIOT is to promote education in and the study of the administration and practice of taxation. One of its key aims is to achieve a better, more efficient, tax system for all affected by it – taxpayers, advisers and the authorities. The CIOT&#x27;s comments and recommendations on tax issues are made solely in order to achieve its aims: it is entirely apolitical in its work.

The CIOT administers and awards three qualifications: the CTA (Chartered Tax Adviser) qualification for domestic tax practitioners in the United Kingdom, the ADIT (the Advanced Diploma in International Taxation) for international tax professionals around the world and the DITT (Diploma in Tax Technology), which was introduced in November 2022.

==Membership==
Membership is awarded on passing the Institute&#x27;s CTA examinations and completing three years&#x27; practical taxation experience. Members may use the letters CTA (Chartered Tax Adviser), formerly ATII (Associate of the Taxation Institute Incorporated). Members who joined before the change in designatory letters to CTA may continue to use ATII if they wish. The CIOT describes its qualifications as the &#x27;gold standard&#x27;. Fellowship is available following the submission of a thesis or a body of work. Fellow members may use the letters CTA (Fellow), formerly FTII, after their name to indicate fellowship.

Since 2014, the CIOT and Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) have offered the ACA/CTA Joint Programme, a combined route which allows tax students to achieve both prestigious qualifications in a shorter length of time.

==Foundation==
The Institute of Taxation (the forerunner of the Chartered Institute) was formed in 1930, incorporated as a Company Limited by Guarantee. The Chartered Institute is incorporated by Royal Charter. 
One of the founder members was Ronald Staples, the founding editor of Taxation Magazine. It was originally proposed to use the letters ATI (Associate of the Taxation Institute) and FTI (Fellow of the Taxation Institute). When it was discovered that these letters had already been allocated to the Textiles Institute, an extra &quot;I&quot; was added to each set of letters, standing for &quot;Incorporated&quot;.

==Affiliations==
The Institute was the first UK tax body to join the Confédération Fiscale Européenne (CFE).

The 500 members of the Institute of Indirect Taxation (IIT) became members of the CIOT in August 2012 following the memberships of both bodies approving the merger of the two bodies at separate meetings in May 2012.

==Partnerships==
* The CIOT owns a significant collection of taxation-related literature which is held in King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s Maughan Library and is made available to both CIOT and King&#x27;s College members.
* Although an independent organization, the CIOT shares back-office services with the Association of Taxation Technicians.

<text>Mahogany Rush was a Canadian rock band led by guitarist Frank Marino. Formed in Montreal, Quebec in 1969, the band had its peak of popularity in the 1970s, playing venues as large as California Jam II.

The band is perhaps best known for Marino&#x27;s soaring lead guitar which bears a strong resemblance to the playing of Jimi Hendrix. Long-term members of the band have included bassist Paul Harwood and drummer Jimmy Ayoub, and Frank&#x27;s brother Vince on guitar; Frank Marino is the sole continuous member of the band. Starting in the late 1970s, the group recorded and toured as Frank Marino &amp; Mahogany Rush.

== Musical style ==
Marino has described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;The Grateful Dead meets jazz&quot;.

== Beginnings ==
In an effort to gain press attention, the original record company created a fictional story that Frank Marino, prior to starting the band, had spent time in a mental institution after taking LSD and was visited by Jimi Hendrix in a vision.

Over time, the band migrated to a larger and more financially supported record company and achieved its greatest radio hit success with the song &quot;Strange Dreams&quot;. The single &quot;A New Rock &amp; Roll&quot; reached #70 on the Canadian charts.It also reached #88 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 charts.

<text>Sir Philip Armand Thomas Hamilton Gibbs KBE, Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur, (1 May 1877 – 10 March 1962) was an English journalist and author who served as one of five official British reporters during the First World War. 

==Early life==
The son of a civil servant, Gibbs was born in Kensington, London. He received a home education and determined at an early age to develop a career as a writer. Four of his siblings were also writers: A. Hamilton Gibbs, Francis Hamilton Gibbs, Helen Hamilton Gibbs and Cosmo Hamilton, as was his father Henry James Gibbs and his son, Anthony. Gibbs was a Roman Catholic.

==Career==
His first article was published in 1894 in the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;; five years later he published the first of many books, &quot;Founders of the Empire&quot;. He was given the post of literary editor at Alfred Harmsworth&#x27;s leading (and growing) tabloid format newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. He subsequently worked on other prominent newspapers including the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot;, in 1940 referring to 1909, credited Gibbs for &quot;bursting the bubble with one cable to the London newspaper he was representing&quot;. The bubble in question was the September 1909 claim by American explorer Frederick Cook to have reached the North Pole in April 1908. Gibbs didn&#x27;t trust Cook&#x27;s &quot;romantic&quot; impressions of his journey into the ice.

His first attempt at semi-fiction was published in 1909 as &quot;The Street of Adventure&quot;, which recounted the story of the official Liberal Party newspaper &quot;Tribune&quot;, founded in 1906 and failing spectacularly in 1908. The paper was founded at vast expense by Franklin Thomasson, MP for Leicester from 1906 to 1910. A man of decidedly liberal views, Gibbs took an interest in popular movements of the time, including the suffragettes, publishing a book on the British women&#x27;s suffrage movement in 1910. With tensions growing in Europe in the years immediately preceding 1914, Gibbs repeatedly expressed a belief that war could be avoided between the Entente and Central Powers.

As one of five official war correspondents Gibbs wrote about the Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917): 

Gibbs&#x27; work appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;. The price he had to pay for accreditation was to submit to effective censorship: all of his work was to be vetted by C. E. Montague, formerly of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. He agreed, although unhappy with the arrangement. Gibbs&#x27; wartime output was prodigious. He produced a stream of newspaper articles and a series of books: &quot;The Soul of the War&quot; (1915), &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot; (1917), &quot;From Bapaume to Passchendaele&quot; (1918) and &quot;The Realities of War&quot; (UK title, 1920; &quot;Now it Can Be Told&quot;, United States title, 1920). Gibbs&#x27; work in the immediate post-war period was focused on a fear of societal unrest created by brutalised ‘ape-men’ and wartime-employed women who &#x27;were clinging onto their jobs, would not let go of the pocket-money which they had spent on frocks’. He was awarded KBE in the 1920 civilian war honours. The same year he was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the French government.

In &quot;The Realities of War&quot; Gibbs exacted a form of revenge for the frustration he suffered in submitting to wartime censorship; published after the armistice, the book gave an account of his personal experiences in war-torn Europe, painting a most unflattering portrait of Sir Douglas Haig, British Commander-in-Chief in France and Flanders, and his General Headquarters.

Working as a freelance journalist, having resigned from the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; over its support for the Lloyd George government&#x27;s Irish policy, he published a series of books and articles. These included the introduction to &quot;Ireland in Insurrection&quot; about recent English atrocities in that country and an autobiography, &quot;Adventures in Journalism&quot; (1923).

Gibbs&#x27; 1937 book &quot;Ordeal In England&quot; was a study of poverty and also an anti-socialist critique of &quot;English Journey&quot; by J. B. Priestley and &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; by George Orwell. &quot;Ordeal In England&quot; was later republished by the conservative Right Book Club.

The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought Gibbs a renewed appointment as a war correspondent, this time for the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;. This proved a brief stint, however, and he spent part of the war employed by the Ministry of Information, the department responsible for publicity and propaganda, which the British government re-established in September 1939. In 1946 he published a second volume of memoirs, &quot;The Pageant of the Years&quot;. Two further volumes followed in 1949 and 1957, &quot;Crowded Company&quot; and &quot;Life&#x27;s Adventure&quot;.

==Death==
Gibbs died in Godalming, Surrey, on 10 March 1962.

<doc id="977849" wikidata="Q1345146" url="?curid=977849" title="Jaroslav Ježek (composer)">
<text>Jaroslav Ježek () (September 25, 1906 – January 1, 1942) was a Czech composer, pianist and conductor, author of jazz, classical, incidental and film music.

== Life ==
Ježek was born in the Prague quarter of Žižkov to the family of a tailor. He was almost blind from a young age. He studied composition at the Prague Conservatory as a pupil of Karel Boleslav Jirák (1924–1927), at the master school of composition with Josef Suk (1927–1930), and shortly also with Alois Hába (1927–1928). Ježek met the playwrights/comedians Jan Werich and Jiří Voskovec, leaders of the &quot;Osvobozené divadlo&quot; (Prague Liberated Theatre) in Prague, and took up the post of main composer and conductor for the theatre. During the next decade (from 1928 to 1939), he composed incidental music, songs, dances, and ballets for the comic and satirical plays of Voskovec and Werich. In 1934 he became a member of Czech Group of Surrealists. Forced to leave Czechoslovakia following the Nazi occupation, Ježek, Voskovec and Werich went into exile in New York City. He worked as a piano teacher and choirmaster there, and continued to work with Voskovec and Werich. In 1942, the long-ill Ježek died of chronic kidney disease in New York. On December 29, 1941, three days before his death, Ježek married Frances Bečáková.

He collaborated with many avant-garde artists of pre-war Czechoslovakia, such as Vítězslav Nezval and E. F. Burian.

== Music ==
His musical output is commonly divided into two parts. The first part of his work consists of chamber, piano and concertant compositions, created first under the influence of Stravinsky, of the Parisian Les Six and of Arnold Schoenberg. Later he found his own, specific and modern expression. He also became a popular jazz composer in pre-war Czechoslovakia. He composed songs and dances for the revue plays of the Prague Free Theatre (The Ass and the Shadow, Caesar, The Headsman and the Fool e.g.) and also for the films of Voskovec and Werich (&quot;Pudr a benzín&quot;, &quot;The World Is Ours&quot;, &quot;Heave-Ho!&quot;). His melodies are popular in the Czech Republic to this day. Ježek was also evidently fascinated by American jazz. Between 1929 and 1936, possibly earlier, he organized and conducted an orchestra featuring his original jazz compositions and arrangements. Billed variously as &quot;Ježek&#x27;s Jazz&quot; and &quot;Ježkův swingband&quot; they recorded for the Czech &quot;Ultraphon&quot; label, making some of the most original music in Europe. &quot;Bugatti Step&quot; (1930; Ultraphone A10166) is an up-tempo number for piano and jazz orchestra, enjoying enduring popularity as a hot jazz piano solo. &quot;Teď ještě ne&quot; (1931; Ultraphon A10217) is rousing dance music in the Jean Goldkette or Coon-Sanders&#x27; Nighthawks style. &quot;Rubbish Heap Blues&quot; (1937; Ultraphon A11421) shows that Ježek not only listened to Duke Ellington&#x27;s records, but was keeping up with Duke&#x27;s very latest work. &quot;Rubbish Heap&quot; features a Johnny Hodges-like alto sax and a Cootie Williams-like growl trumpet, plus a three-trombone section to complement the three trumpets. Ježek&#x27;s composition titled simply &quot;Polonaisa&quot; (1931; Ultraphon A10355) is a traditional Polonaise clothed in modern instrumentation, harmony and textures. It is as if Chopin and Gershwin had collaborated, the Polish dance rhythms mingling easily with hot syncopation. Ježek also turned the boys loose in records of his arrangements of well-known hot jazz standards, such as &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, &quot;Dinah&quot; and &quot;Chinatown, My Chinatown&quot;. These recordings, very few of which could have survived the Nazi occupation and World War II, are almost completely unknown, at least in the United States.

A seven-volume album retrospective of Voskovec and Werich&#x27;s work for the Liberated Theater (1929–1938) containing the items mentioned above and dozens of others was issued by the Czech Supraphon label in 1994 (and reissued in 2007).

<text>The Army Air Force Technician Badge was an award of the United States Army Air Forces, which was first created in 1941. Similar in design to the Weapons Qualification Badge, the Army Air Force Technician Badge was awarded to denote special training and qualifications held by members of the Army Air Force.

The Army Air Force Technician Badge appeared as a wreathed propeller from which qualification bars were suspended that denoted the training and qualifications held by the wearer. 27 bars were authorized to the Army Air Force Technician Badge, including:

* AP ARMORER (Aircraft armory specialists)
* LINK TRAINER INST (Ground school training personnel)
* T RET &amp; SIGHT SP (Weapons calibration and systems experts)
* TELETYPE MECH (Teletype Mechanic)
* WX FORECASTER (Meteorologists and weather forecasters)

With the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, the Army Air Force Technician Badge was renamed as the &quot;Air Force Technician Badge&quot; and was authorized for wear into the 1960s. There were no Air Force Technician Badges issued after the Korean War, however, and by the 1970s the badge was considered obsolete.

<doc id="977858" wikidata="Q7308923" url="?curid=977858" title="Reynold Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Sterborough">
<text>Reynold Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Sterborough, KG (c.1295–1361) was a medieval English knight and diplomat.

==Life==
He was the son of Sir Reynold Cobham by Joan, the daughter and heir of William de Evere. This Reynold was the second son of John de Cobham, by his first wife Joan the daughter of William Fitzbenedict. The family were based at Sterborough Castle, Lingfield, Surrey.

In his early life he was employed on diplomatic missions. By 1334 he was a knight in the household of King Edward III and fought in the Scottish campaign against David de Bruce and then on the continent in the Low Countries and Brittany. In 1342 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Cobham of Sterborough.

In 1346 he was in the force under Edward III that attacked France, fighting at the Battle of Crécy and the protracted but eventually successful Siege of Calais. In 1352 he was invested as a Knight of the Garter and in 1353 appointed Captain of Calais, a position he held until his death. In 1355 he served under the Edward the Black Prince in Aquitaine, taking part in his march to the Loire and his victory at the Battle of Poitiers, where he was credited by the French historian Jean Froissart with the slaying of the French knight Geoffroi de Charny.

Reynold married Joan Berkeley by whom he could claim to be related to the noble families of Sutton, Dudley, Beauchamp, De Despencer and Mortimer. The Cobham family, however, were well connected to the ruling families of England in their own right.

He died in 1361, probably of the plague, and was laid to rest in an impressive tomb in Lingfield church. He was succeeded by his son Reynold, the second Lord Sterborough.

<text>William Baylebridge (12 December 1883 – 7 May 1942), born Charles William Blocksidge, was an Australian writer, poet, and political theorist.

==Early life==
Baylebridge was born in Brisbane, Queensland, the son of George Henry Blocksidge. He studied at Brisbane Grammar School, then under a private tutor, the classicist David Owen.

==Years in England==
In 1908, he sailed to London with his friend (and future brother-in-law) Robert Graham Brown. He travelled extensively throughout the Continent, absorbing much of the intellectual milieu of that period. At that same time, he published several volumes of juvenilia, starting with &quot;Songs o’ the South&quot; in 1908, which was published by the secularist Charles Albert Watts. These early works were generally poorly received, and later, in order to dissociate himself from the embarrassment of having produced them, Blocksidge adopted the name ‘William Baylebridge’, both personally and professionally, in around 1925.

While living in London, Baylebridge also published his earliest statements of fascist political theory, in both verse and aphoristic prose. These works were &quot;The New Life&quot; (1910) and &quot;National Notes&quot; (1913), both of which advanced a form of proto-fascism he called the ‘New Nationalism’, thus preceding the Italian movement by several years. In this regard, he was influenced primarily by British interpreters of Nietzsche, particularly the British eugenicists, notably John Davidson and George Bernard Shaw, as well as the Italian writer and revolutionary Gabriele D’Annunzio. He remained in Europe until 1919.

==Return to Australia and later life==

When he returned to Australia in 1919, after over a decade abroad, he quickly moved to Sydney, where he divided his time between the city and a cottage in Blackheath. That same year, he released his first Australian publication, &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, which was published in Brisbane by Gordon &amp; Gotch, partly through the help of a circle of Melbourne writers which included Nettie Palmer and Frank Wilmot. Shortly afterwards, he published his first novel, &quot;An Anzac Muster&quot; (1921), in London, possibly—as with his other English publications—with the help of a relative, the printer Edwin Blocksidge (&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, 3 November 1934, pp. 5).

For the rest of his life, Baylebridge consciously cultivated the air of a mysterious and reclusive prophet-poet. This involved not only the archaic style of his poetry and prose, but also his eschewing of all forms of conventional publicity. He rarely published in anthologies; he refused to sit for portraits (despite several offers); he also refused, when asked, to speak at public events.

Baylebridge died on 7 May 1942. He is buried in South Head Cemetery. He never married and had no children.

==Reception==
Though he was considered one of the premier poets of his day, critical opinion of Baylebridge has since waned considerably. On balance, the critic Firmin McKinnon probably put it best: &quot;[Baylebridge&#x27;s] outstanding fault is his obscurity, much of which, one fears, was deliberate and artificial. That is a pity for unquestionably he had poetic genius. Because of his affectation and obscurity his poetry will remain only for that select few who are willing to plod their way across tedious stretches of aridity in the hope of finding a few rare exotic blooms in places unfrequented by the ordinary seeker of Truth and Beauty.&quot;

<doc id="977873" wikidata="Q3133363" url="?curid=977873" title="His Majesty's Railway Inspectorate">
<text>Established in 1840, His Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) is the organisation responsible for overseeing safety on Britain&#x27;s railways and tramways. It was previously a separate non-departmental public body, but from 1990 to April 2006 it was part of the Health and Safety Executive. It was then transferred to the Office of Rail and Road and ceased to exist by that name in May 2009 when it was renamed the Safety Directorate. However, in summer 2015 its name was re-established as the safety arm of ORR.

== Modern HMRI inspectorate ==
The modern HMRI within the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) identifies as &quot;The Railway Inspectorate&quot;. HMRI works in tandem with the rest of the ORR, and as such may be consulted on matters effecting industry efficiency.

Internally, most of HMRI&#x27;s inspectors are part of the Railway Safety Directorate (RSD) of the ORR, although some Railway Performance and Planning (RPP) engineers have some more limited powers as warranted HMRI individuals.

HMRI&#x27;s role and powers largely mirror the HSE which is the safety regulator in other non-railway industries. HMRI has powers to enter a railway under section 20 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It also issues licensing and drivers&#x27; licences under the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (ROGS).

HMRI&#x27;s individuals are drawn from within industry and experienced HSE inspectors. Commonly, individuals are professional engineers or time-served safety professionals. All inspectors are issued a warrant by the chief inspector to that effect. Normally an inspector will use the industry Personal Track Safety (PTS) card. However, inspectors have the right, in reasonable circumstances, not to do so.

== History ==
===First fifty years===
====Establishment====
The body originated in 1840, as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1840 (&#x27;Lord Seymour&#x27;s Act&#x27;), when Inspecting Officers of Railways were first appointed by the Board of Trade (BoT). 

Britain&#x27;s railways at that time were private companies; the 1840 Act required them to report to the BoT all accidents which had caused personal injury: it also gave the inspectorate powers to inspect any railway, and hence from its formation the inspectorate was used to investigate serious railway accidents and report upon them to the BoT.

====Inspection of new lines====
They were tasked with inspecting new lines, and commenting on their suitability for carrying passenger traffic.

However, the inspectorate had no powers to require changes until the Railway Regulation Act 1842 (&#x27;An Act for the better Regulation of Railways and for the Conveyance of Troops&#x27;) gave the BoT powers to delay opening of new lines if the inspectorate was concerned about &quot;Incompleteness of the Works or permanent Way, or the Insufficiency of the Establishment&quot; for working the line.

====Crash investigation====
Their first investigation was of the Howden rail crash on 7 August 1840, which had killed five passengers (although the inspector&#x27;s report said four, three passengers were killed instantly, two dying later of their injuries) as a result of the derailment of a train caused by the fall of a large casting from a wagon on a passenger train. 

The inspectorate&#x27;s reports of their accident investigations were made to the BoT alone, but eventually published as part of the BoT&#x27;s annual report to Parliament.

====Competence====
Until the late 1960s HMRI&#x27;s inspecting officers were all recruited from the Corps of Royal Engineers. In the early years of the inspectorate, their competence to adjudicate on civil engineering structures was questioned by critics, sometimes with good reason.

A reorganisation of the inspectorate in November 1846 abolished the post of inspector-general, and led to the departure of Major-General Charles Pasley, the incumbent, and one of his subordinates.

Pasley had come under criticism after the bridges and earthworks of the North British Railway&#x27;s line from Edinburgh to Berwick – approved by Pasley in June 1846 – failed to withstand heavy rain in September 1846, with nineteen miles of track being rendered unusable. Temporary works were undertaken to restore a service, Pasley approved them (orally), but some of the new work then proved faulty.

In 1849 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway&#x27;s Torksey viaduct across the River Trent was not initially accepted by the railway inspector Lintorn Simmons because he was unhappy with its novel (tubular girder) design by John Fowler. 

This decision (and also the basic premise that a bridge designed by a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) which had passed all practical tests could be rejected by a railway inspector because he was uncomfortable with its novel design) was criticised by the ICE:

Threatened with a call for a parliamentary enquiry should approval continue to be withheld, the inspectorate reconsidered and approved the bridge un-modified.

Subsequently, and consequently, the BoT took the view that (as it explained in defending itself from criticism that the defects in the Tay Bridge should have been seen and acted upon by the inspectorate):

Critics at the end of the 1850s also noted that during the Crimean War, the Grand Crimean Central Railway had been built to forward supplies from Balaclava to British siege lines not by the Royal Engineers, but by a consortium of civilian railway contractors. If the government turned to civilians as best fitted to build a military railway, was it not anomalous that it thought military engineers best fitted to inspect new railway lines?

====Extension and formalisation of powers====
The inspectorate&#x27;s powers were extended and formalised by the Railway Regulation Act 1871 (&#x27;An Act to amend the Law respecting the Inspection and Regulation of Railways&#x27;). Paragraph 4 extended the power to inspect to give inspectors explicit powers to require the production of persons and papers by a company being inspected. Paragraph 5 meant new works on existing lines were liable to the same inspection regime as new lines. The BoT could now set up a formal court of inquiry to investigate an accident, taking evidence on oath in public hearings. Inspectors investigating an accident were now required to make a formal report to the BoT, which was now empowered to publish reports (from an inspector or from a court of inquiry) directly.

Subsequent public inquiries under the new powers included those into the Shipton-on-Cherwell train crash in 1874 (chaired by an inspector William Yolland), and into the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. However, the procedure fell into abeyance after the failure of the three-man board (of which Yolland, by now chief inspecting officer, was a member) of the Tay Bridge inquiry to arrive at an agreed report.

For many years in the mid-19th century the Railway Inspectorate advocated in its accident returns and otherwise three safety measures it saw as vital to ensure passenger safety: 
* &quot;lock&quot; Interlocking of points and signals, so that conflicting signal indications are prevented;
* &quot;block&quot; A space-interval or absolute block system of signalling, where one train is not allowed to enter a physical section until the preceding one had left it; and
* &quot;brake&quot; Continuous brakes, to put at the command of the engine driver adequate braking power; this requirement being increased as the technology made it reasonable to &#x27;automatic&#x27; (in modern parlance &#x27;fail-safe&#x27;) continuous brakes which had to be &#x27;held off&#x27; by vacuum or compressed air and would be applied automatically if that supply was lost (e.g. if a train were divided).

The Board of Trade got as far and as fast as it could by persuasion, but had no powers to enforce its views on often reluctant railway managements of existing lines. 

Inspectors disagreed as to whether the board should be given powers to require changes. Yolland&#x27;s official report on an 1867 accident (in which eight people died at a junction unaltered since an 1862 fatal accident, despite an inspector having urged improvements) pressed for such powers:

Tyler himself supported the view taken by successive governments: that to take such powers would remove the clarity of existing arrangements, where responsibility for passenger safety lay with the railway companies alone.

The death of 80 people on a Sunday school outing in the Armagh rail disaster of 1889 brought a reversal of this policy on the three key issues: within two months of the accident Parliament had enacted the Regulation of Railways Act 1889, which authorised the Board of Trade to require the use of continuous automatic brakes on passenger railways, along with the block system of signalling and the interlocking of all points and signals. This is often taken as the beginning of the modern era in UK rail safety: &quot;the old happy-go-lucky days of railway working&quot; came to an end.

===Modern era===
The chief inspecting officer from 1916 to 1929 was Colonel John Wallace Pringle, responsible for investigating many accidents. It was during his tenure, in 1919, that the office became part of the newly created Ministry of Transport. 

The last chief inspecting officer with a Royal Engineers background, Major Rose, retired in 1988 and he was replaced by an appointee from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). 

Since then, inspecting officers have been recruited from the HSE or as mid-career railway employees from the former British Rail.

===List of chief inspecting officers / HM Chief Inspectors of Railways===
==Original twin functions of the HMRI==
The function of HMRI was to inspect and approve all new (or modified) railway works and to investigate railway accidents.

Accident investigations were &quot;inquisitorial&quot;, generally not open to the public, and aimed to determine the causes behind the accident (both the immediate cause and contributory factors) and to make recommendations to avoid re-occurrence. Until the 1860s, in the first instance, accident reports were internal and only published in the accident returns made from time to time by the Board of Trade to Parliament. For fatal accidents, a coroner&#x27;s inquest would also be held, which inspectors might attend to hear the evidence, to assist the coroner, or to give evidence themselves of what their investigation had found. In the absence of input from the inspectorate, inquests rarely went beyond the immediate cause; hence, said one inspector in 1870:

Coroner&#x27;s inquests were public and their proceedings and verdicts widely reported in the press.

In later years, accident reports were published directly, widely circulated within the railway industry, and reported upon by the press.

== Recent history ==
The HMRI became part of the Department of Transport and remained so until 1990, when it was transferred to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). About this time HMRI expanded its scope and recruited additional staff, Railway Employment Officers. It was their job to monitor the workplace safety and health of railway employees.

After the move to the HSE, (newsworthy) train crash investigations tended to be held as public inquiries presided over by a High Court judge; and the findings published. These inquiries tended to be more adversarial; with the aim of identifying the guilty parties. In some cases criminal prosecution of these parties has occurred in parallel with the public inquiry, delaying the inquiry until the criminal prosecutions have been completed.

The transfer to the HSE was unpopular with many in the industry, and as part of its rail review in 2004 the government announced that the Railway Inspectorate would be transferred from the HSE to merge with the Office of Rail Regulation (now the Office of Rail and Road). The transfer took place on 2 April 2006.

The inspectorate oversaw both operational safety and the initial integrity of new and modified works. As a result of the legislative change, which transferred them to the Office of Rail Regulation, the scope of HMRI enforcement no longer covered guided bus, trolleybus and most cable-hauled transport systems.

In May 2009 the legal entity known as &quot;HM Railway Inspectorate&quot; ceased to exist when a single rail regulatory body covering both safety and economic issues, the Safety Directorate, was created, but the 180 individual inspectors will continue to be known as His Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectors.

A summary of government bodies overseeing HM Railway Inspectorate are shown in the table. Several changes reflect wider government re-organisations.

<doc id="977878" wikidata="Q935116" url="?curid=977878" title="Sandringham House">
<text>Sandringham House is a country house in the parish of Sandringham, Norfolk, England. It is one of the royal residences of Charles III, whose grandfather, George VI, and great-grandfather, George V, both died there. The house stands in a estate in the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The house is listed as Grade II* and the landscaped gardens, park and woodlands are on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

The site has been occupied since Elizabethan times, when a large manor house was constructed. This was replaced in 1771 by a Georgian mansion for the owners, the Hoste Henleys. In 1836 Sandringham was bought by John Motteux, a London merchant, who already owned property in Norfolk and Surrey. Motteux had no direct heir, and on his death in 1843, his entire estate was left to Charles Spencer Cowper, the son of Motteux&#x27;s close friend Emily Temple, Viscountess Palmerston. Cowper sold the Norfolk and the Surrey estates and embarked on rebuilding at Sandringham. He led an extravagant life, and by the early 1860s, the estate was mortgaged and he and his wife spent most of their time on the Continent.

In 1862, Sandringham and just under of land were purchased for £220,000 for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, as a country home for him and his future wife, Princess Alexandra of Denmark. Between 1870 and 1900, the house was almost completely rebuilt in a style described by Pevsner as &quot;frenetic Jacobean&quot;. Albert Edward also developed the estate, creating one of the finest shoots in England. Following his death in 1910, the estate passed to Edward&#x27;s son and heir, George V, who described the house as &quot;dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world&quot;. It was the setting for the first royal Christmas broadcast in 1932. George died at the house on 20 January 1936. The estate passed to his son Edward VIII and, at his abdication, as the private property of the monarch, it was purchased by Edward&#x27;s brother, George VI. George was as devoted to the house as his father, writing to his mother Queen Mary, &quot;I have always been so happy here and I love the place&quot;. He died at Sandringham on 6 February 1952.

On the King&#x27;s death, Sandringham passed to his daughter Elizabeth II. The Queen spent about two months each winter on the Sandringham Estate, including the anniversary of her father&#x27;s death and of her own accession in early February. In 1957, she broadcast her first televised Christmas message from Sandringham. In the 1960s, plans were drawn up to demolish the house and replace it with a modern building, but these were not carried out. In 1977, to mark her Silver Jubilee, the Queen opened the house and grounds to the public for the first time. Unlike the royal palaces owned by the Crown, such as Buckingham Palace, Holyrood Palace and Windsor Castle, Sandringham (along with Balmoral Castle in Scotland) is owned personally by the monarch. In 2022, following the Queen&#x27;s death, Sandringham passed to her son and heir Charles III.

==History==

===Early history===

Sandringham is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;sant-Dersingham&quot; (the sandy part of Dersingham) and the land was awarded to a Norman knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the Norman Conquest. The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study &quot;The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham&quot;, records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa near Appleton farm. In the 15th century it was held by Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales, brother-in-law to Edward IV. In the Elizabethan era a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees. In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall. In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley died without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant. Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston. At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris. On succeeding to Motteux&#x27;s estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham. He undertook extensions to the hall, employing Samuel Sanders Teulon to add an elaborate porch and conservatory. Cowper&#x27;s style of living was extravagant – he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent – and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000. The death in 1854, from cholera, of their only child Mary Harriette, led the couple to spend even more time abroad – mainly in Paris – and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate.

===Edward VII===
In 1861 Queen Victoria&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Albert Edward, was approaching his twentieth birthday. Edward&#x27;s dissipated lifestyle had been disappointing to his parents, and his father, Prince Albert, thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the prince in country life and pursuits and lessen the influence of the &quot;Marlborough House set&quot; with which he was involved. Albert had his staff investigate 18 possible country estates that might be suitable, including Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The need to act quickly was reinforced by the Nellie Clifden affair, when Edward&#x27;s fellow officers smuggled the actress into his quarters. The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents. Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the prime minister Lord Palmerston, stepfather to the owner, swayed Prince Albert. Negotiations were only slightly delayed by Albert&#x27;s death in December 1861—his widow declared, &quot;His wishes – his plans – about everything are to be my law&quot;. Edward visited in February 1862, and a sale was agreed for the house and just under of land, which was finalised that October. Queen Victoria only twice visited the house she had paid for. Over the course of the next forty years, and with considerable expenditure, Edward was to create a house and country estate that his friend Charles Carington called &quot;the most comfortable in England&quot;.

The price paid for Sandringham, £220,000, has been described as &quot;exorbitant&quot;. This is questioned by Helen Walch, author of the estate&#x27;s recent (2012) history, who shows the detailed analysis undertaken by the Prince Consort&#x27;s advisers and suggests that the cost was reasonable. However, the house was soon found to be too small to accommodate the Prince of Wales&#x27;s establishment following his marriage in March 1863 and the many guests he wished to entertain. In 1865, two years after moving in, the prince commissioned A. J. Humbert to raze the original hall and create a much larger building. Humbert was an architect favoured by the royal family—&quot;for no good reason&quot;, according to the architectural historian Mark Girouard—and had previously undertaken work for Queen Victoria at Osborne House and at Frogmore House. The new red-brick house was complete by late 1870; the only element of the original house of the Henley Hostes and the Cowpers that was retained was the elaborate conservatory designed by Teulon in the 1830s. Edward had this room converted into a billiard room. A plaque in the entrance hall records that &quot;This house was built by Albert Edward Prince of Wales and Alexandra his wife in the year of our Lord 1870&quot;. The building was entered through a large porte-cochère straight into the main living room (the saloon), an arrangement that was subsequently found to be inconvenient. The house provided living and sleeping accommodation over three storeys, with attics and a basement. The Norfolk countryside surrounding the house appealed to Alexandra, as it reminded her of her native Denmark.
Within a decade, the house was again found to be too small, and in 1883 a new extension, the Bachelors&#x27; Wing, was constructed to the designs of a Norfolk architect, Colonel R. W. Edis. Edis also built a new billiard room and converted the old conservatory into a bowling alley. The Prince of Wales had been impressed by one he had seen at Trentham Hall in Staffordshire, and the alley at Sandringham was modelled on an example from Rumpenheim Castle, Germany. In 1891, during preparations for Edward&#x27;s fiftieth birthday, a serious fire broke out when maids lit all the fires in the second-floor bedrooms to warm them in advance of the prince&#x27;s arrival. Edis was recalled to undertake rebuilding and further construction. As he had with the Bachelors&#x27; Wing, Edis tried to harmonise these additions with Humbert&#x27;s house by following the original Jacobethan style, and by using matching brickwork and Ketton stone.

The house was up to date in its facilities, the modern kitchens and lighting running on gas from the estate&#x27;s own plant and water being supplied from the Appleton Water Tower, constructed at the highest point on the estate. The tower was designed in an Italianate style by Robert Rawlinson, and Alexandra laid the foundation stone in 1877. The Prince&#x27;s efforts as a country gentleman were approved by the press of the day; a contemporary newspaper expressed a wish to &quot;&quot;Sandringhamize&quot; Marlborough House – as a landlord, agriculturist and country gentleman, the Prince sets an example which might be followed with advantage&quot;.

The royal couple&#x27;s developments at Sandringham were not confined to the house; over the course of their occupation, the wider estate was also transformed. Ornamental and kitchen gardens were established, employing over 100 gardeners at their peak. Many estate buildings were constructed, including cottages for staff, kennels, a school, a rectory and a staff clubhouse, the Babingley. Edward also made Sandringham one of the best sporting estates in England to provide a setting for the elaborate weekend shooting parties that became Sandringham&#x27;s defining rationale. To increase the amount of daylight available during the shooting season, which ran from October to February, the prince introduced the tradition of Sandringham Time, whereby all the clocks on the estate were set half an hour ahead of GMT. This tradition was maintained until 1936. Edward&#x27;s entertaining was legendary, and the scale of the slaughter of game birds, predominantly pheasants and partridges, was colossal. The meticulously maintained game books recorded annual bags of between 6,000 and 8,000 birds in the 1870s, rising to bags of over 20,000 a year by 1900. The game larder, constructed for the storage of the carcasses, was inspired by that at Holkham Hall and was the largest in Europe. 

Guests for Sandringham house parties generally arrived at Wolferton railway station, 2.5 miles from the house, travelling in royal trains that ran from St Pancras Station to King&#x27;s Lynn and then on to Wolferton. The station served the house from 1862 until its closure in 1969. Thereafter, the Queen and others staying at the house have generally travelled by car from King&#x27;s Lynn. Edward VII established the Sandringham stud in 1897, achieving considerable success with the racehorses Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee. Neither his son nor his grandsons evinced as much interest in horses, although the stud was maintained; but his great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II, tried to match Edward&#x27;s equestrian achievements and bred several winners at the Sandringham Stud.

On 14 January 1892, Edward&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, died of pneumonia at the house. He is commemorated in the clock tower, which bears an inscription in Latin that translates as &quot;the hours perish and will be charged to our account&quot;.

===George V===
In his will Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate. Queen Alexandra&#x27;s continued occupancy of the &quot;big house&quot; compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather &quot;cramped&quot; conditions. Suggestions from courtiers that Queen Alexandra might move out were firmly rebuffed by the King; &quot;It is my mother&#x27;s house, my father built it for her&quot;. The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook, with the small rooms reportedly reminding him of the onboard cabins of his naval career.
The new King&#x27;s primary interests, aside from his constitutional duties, were shooting and stamp collecting. He was considered one of the best shots in England, and his collections of shotguns and stamps were among the finest in the world. Deeply conservative by nature, George sought to maintain the traditions of Sandringham estate life established by his father, and life at York Cottage provided respite from the constitutional and political struggles that overshadowed the early years of George&#x27;s reign. Even greater upheaval was occasioned by the outbreak of the First World War, a dynastic struggle that involved many of his relatives, including the German Kaiser and the Russian Emperor, both of whom had previously been guests at Sandringham. The estate and village of Sandringham suffered a major loss when all but two members of the King&#x27;s Own Sandringham Company, a territorial unit of the Fifth Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment, were killed at Suvla Bay during the Gallipoli Campaign. The story of the battalion was the subject of a BBC drama, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;. A memorial to the dead was raised on the estate; the names of those killed in the Second World War were added subsequently.

Following Queen Alexandra&#x27;s death at Sandringham on 20 November 1925, the King and his family moved to the main house. In 1932, George V gave the first of the royal Christmas messages from a studio erected at Sandringham. The speech, written by Rudyard Kipling, began, &quot;I speak now from my home and from my heart to you all&quot;. George V died in his bedroom at Sandringham at 11:55 p.m. on 20 January 1936, his death hastened by injections of morphine and cocaine, to maintain the King&#x27;s dignity and to enable the announcement of his death to be made in the following day&#x27;s &quot;Times&quot;. The King&#x27;s body was moved to St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church, a scene described by the late King&#x27;s assistant private secretary, &quot;Tommy&quot; Lascelles. &quot;Next evening we took him over to the little church at the end of the garden. We saw the lych-gate brilliantly lit [and] the guardsmen slung the coffin on their shoulders and laid it before the altar. After a brief service, we left it, to be watched over by the men of the Sandringham Estate.&quot; Two days later, George&#x27;s body was transported by train from Wolferton to London, and to its lying in state at Westminster Hall.

===Edward VIII===
On the night of his father&#x27;s death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to Greenwich Mean Time, ending the tradition of Sandringham time begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier. Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father&#x27;s time or that of his grandfather. He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress Freda Dudley Ward, dated 26 December 1919; &quot;it&#x27;s too dull and boring for words. Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can&#x27;t imagine&quot;. In another letter, evenings at the &quot;big house&quot;—Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father—were recorded as &quot;sordidly dull and boring&quot;. His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father&#x27;s will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house. His brothers were each left £750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall. A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King&#x27;s personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as &quot;the Kingship without the cash&quot;.

Edward&#x27;s concerns regarding his income led him immediately to focus on the expense associated with running his late father&#x27;s private homes. Sandringham he described as a &quot;voracious white elephant&quot;, and he asked his brother, the Duke of York to undertake a review of the management of the estate, which had been costing his father £50,000 annually in subsidies at the time of his death. The review recommended significant retrenchments, and its partial implementation caused considerable resentment among the dismissed staff. After the night of his father&#x27;s death at Sandringham, Edward spent only one further night of his reign at the house, bringing Wallis Simpson for a shooting party in October 1936. The party was interrupted by a request to meet with prime minister Stanley Baldwin, and having arrived on a Sunday, the King returned to Fort Belvedere the next day. He never returned to Sandringham; and, his attention diverted by the impending crisis arising from his attachment to Simpson, within two months of his only visit to the house as king, he had abdicated. On his abdication, as Sandringham and Balmoral Castle were the private property of the monarch, it was necessary for King George VI to purchase both properties. The price paid, £300,000, was a cause of friction between the new King and his brother.

===George VI===

George VI had been born at Sandringham on 14 December 1895. A keen follower of country pursuits, he was as devoted to the estate as his father, writing to his mother, Queen Mary, &quot;I have always been so happy here&quot;. The deep retrenchment he had proposed when commissioned by his brother to review the estate was not enacted, but economies were still made. His mother was at church at Sandringham on Sunday 3 September 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War was declared. The house was shut up during the war, but occasional visits were made to the estate, with the family staying at outlying cottages. After the war the King made improvements to the gardens surrounding the house but, as traditionalist as his father, he made few other changes. December 1945 saw the first celebration of Christmas at the house since 1938. Lady Airlie recorded her impressions at dinner: &quot;I sat next to the King. His face was tired and strained and he ate practically nothing. Looking at him I felt the cold fear of the probability of another short reign&quot;.

George was a heavy smoker throughout his life and had an operation to remove part of his lung in September 1951. He was never fully well again and died at Sandringham during the early morning of 6 February 1952. He had gone out after hares on 5 February, &quot;shooting conspicuously well&quot;, and had planned the next day&#x27;s shoot before retiring at 10.30 p.m. He was discovered at 7.30 a.m. in his bedroom by his valet, having died of a coronary thrombosis at the age of 56. His body was placed in the Church of St Mary Magdalene, before being taken to Wolferton Station and transported by train to London, to lie in state at Westminster Hall.

===Elizabeth II===
As with her predecessors, the house remained one of the two homes owned by the Sovereign in her private capacity, rather than as head of state, the other being Balmoral Castle. Following King George VI&#x27;s death, Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s custom was to spend the anniversary of that and of her own accession privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, toward the end of her reign, to use it as her official base from Christmas until February. In celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen followed the tradition of her last three predecessors, whereas her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, held her celebrations at Windsor Castle. The taxation arrangements of the monarch meant that no inheritance tax was paid on the Sandringham or Balmoral estates when they passed to the Queen, at a time when it was having a deleterious effect on other country estates. On her accession, the Queen asked her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, to take on the responsibility for the management of the estate. The Duke worked to move towards self-sufficiency, generating additional income streams, taking more of the land in hand, and amalgamating many of the smaller tenant farms.
In January 1957 the Queen received the resignation of the Prime Minister Anthony Eden at the house. Eden&#x27;s wife, Clarissa, recorded the event in her diary, &quot;8 January – Anthony has to go through a Cabinet and listening to Harold prosing for half an hour. Then by train to Sandringham. Many photographers. We arrive into the hall where everyone is looking at the television.&quot; At the end of that year, the Queen made her first televised Christmas broadcast from Sandringham. In the 1960s, plans were initiated to demolish the house and replace it with a modern residence by David Roberts, an architect who worked mainly at the University of Cambridge. The plans were not taken forward, but modernisation of the interior of the house and the removal of a range of ancillary buildings were carried out by Hugh Casson, who also decorated the Royal Yacht, &quot;Britannia&quot;. In 1977, for her silver jubilee, the Queen opened the house to the public.

Sandringham continued to operate as a sporting estate. Pheasants and partridge are no longer reared for this purpose, and Sandringham is now one of the few wild shoots in England. Along with her equestrian interest in the Sandringham Stud, where she bred several winning horses, the Queen developed a successful gun dog breeding programme at Sandringham. Following the tradition of a kennels at Sandringham established by her great grandfather, when Queen Alexandra kept over 100 dogs on the estate, the Queen preferred black labrador retrievers, over the yellow type favoured by her father, and the terriers bred by her earlier predecessors.

From his retirement from official duties in August 2017 until his death in April 2021, the Duke of Edinburgh spent much of his time at Wood Farm, a large farmhouse on the Sandringham Estate used by the Duke and the Queen when not hosting guests at the main house. In February 2022 the Queen celebrated the 70th anniversary of her accession at Sandringham. The Queen made her last visit to Sandringham in early July 2022, for five days after completing her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

===Charles III===
On the death of his mother in September 2022, the Sandringham estate passed to King Charles. Following in the tradition of Queen Elizabeth II, the King and Queen Camilla host members of the royal family at Sandringham over Christmas, including attending church services together on Christmas Day.

==Architecture and description==

The house is mainly constructed of red brick with limestone dressings; Norfolk Carrstone is also prevalent, particularly in Edis&#x27;s additions. The tiled roof contains nine separate clusters of chimneystacks. The style is Jacobethan, with inspiration drawn principally from nearby Blickling Hall. Construction was undertaken by Goggs Brothers of Swaffham. The principal rooms of the house are the saloon, the drawing room, the dining room and the ballroom, together with rooms devoted to sports, such as the gun room, or leisure, such as the bowling alley, now a library, and the billiard room. The walls of the corridors connecting the principal rooms display a collection of Oriental and Indian arms and armour, gathered by Edward VII on his tour of the East in 1875–1876. Decoration of the house and the provision of furniture and fittings was undertaken by Holland and Sons in the 1870 rebuilding.

===Saloon===
The largest room in the house, the saloon is used as the main reception room. The arrangement of entry under the porte-cochère direct into the saloon proved problematic, with no ante-room in which guests could remove their hats and coats. Jenkins describes the decorative style, here and elsewhere in the house, as &quot;Osbert Lancaster&#x27;s Curzon Street Baroque&quot;. The room contains portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by their favourite artist Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The saloon functioned as a venue for dances, until the construction of the new ballroom by Edis, and has a minstrels&#x27; gallery to accommodate musicians. The room contains a weighing machine; Edward VII was in the habit of requiring his guests to be weighed on their arrival, and again on their departure, to establish that his lavish hospitality had caused them to put on weight.

===Drawing room===
The drawing room is described by Jenkins as &quot;the nearest Sandringham gets to pomp&quot;. On one of her two visits to the house, Victoria recorded in her journal that, after dinner, the party adjourned to &quot;the very long and handsome drawing room with painted ceiling and two fireplaces&quot;. The room contains portraits of Queen Alexandra and her daughters, Princess Louise, Princess Victoria, and Princess Maud of Wales, by Edward Hughes. White marble statues complete what has been described as a &quot;tour de force of fashionable late-Victorian decoration&quot;.

===Ballroom===
The ballroom was added by Edis in 1884, to overcome the inconvenience of having only the saloon as the major room for entertaining. As this was also the main family living room, it had previously been necessary to remove the furniture when the saloon was required for dances and large entertainments. Alexandra recorded her delight at the result, &quot;Our new ballroom is beautiful I think &amp; a great success &amp; avoids pulling the hall to pieces each time there is a ball or anything&quot;. At the time of Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit in 1889, the room was used for a theatrical performance given by Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. Queen Elizabeth II used the room for entertainments and as a cinema.

===Dining room===

The walls of the dining room are decorated with Spanish tapestries including some by Goya which were a gift from Alfonso XII of Spain. The walls are panelled in oak, painted light green for Queen Mary who had been inspired by a visit to a Scottish castle. Jill Franklin&#x27;s study of the planning of Victorian country houses includes a photograph of the dining room at Sandringham with the table laid for dinner for twenty-four, a &quot;very usual&quot; number to seat for dinner in a major country house of the time.

===Appreciation===
Sandringham House has not been admired by critics. Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert&#x27;s original building and Edis&#x27;s extensions, &quot;a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since&quot;. The architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, &quot;Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally&quot;. In his biography of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy compared the house unfavourably to &quot;a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer&quot;. Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham &quot;unattractive&quot;, with a &quot;grim, institutional appearance&quot;. Nikolaus Pevsner described the architectural style as &quot;frenetic&quot;; Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A. J. Humbert, a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as &quot;the Victorian Royal Family&#x27;s knack for choosing second-rate architects&quot;. An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of &quot;Country Life&quot; opined, &quot;of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal&quot;. The writer Clive Aslet suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than &quot;the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling&quot;.

The fittings and furnishings were also criticised; the biographer of George V, Kenneth Rose, wrote that, &quot;except for some tapestries given by Alfonso XII, Sandringham had not a single good picture, piece of furniture or other work of art&quot;. Neither Edward VII nor his heir were noted for their artistic appreciation; writing of the redevelopments at Buckingham Palace undertaken by George V, and previously by Edward VII, John Martin Robinson wrote that, &quot;the King had no more aesthetic sensibility than his father and expressed impatience with his wife&#x27;s keen interest in furniture and decoration&quot;. In the series of articles on the house and estate published in 1902 by &quot;Country Life&quot; to celebrate Edward VII&#x27;s accession, the author noted the royal family&#x27;s &quot;set policy of preferring those pictures that have &quot;associations&quot; to those which have merely artistic merit&quot;. Exceptions came to include works from the collection of mainly 20th-century English art assembled by the Queen Mother, including pieces by Edward Seago and John Piper, who produced a view of Sandringham. John Piper&#x27;s sombre palette did not always find favour with Queen Elizabeth or her husband, George VI remarking, &quot;You seem to have very bad luck with your weather, Mr Piper&quot;. The house also has an extensive holding of works by Fabergé, the world&#x27;s largest, assembled by Queen Alexandra and later members of the family, which includes representations of farm animals from the Sandringham estate commissioned by Edward VII as presents for his wife.

Although not highly regarded as architecture, Sandringham is a rare extant example of a full-scale Victorian country house, described in the magazine &quot;Country Life&quot; as &quot;lived in and beautifully maintained, complete with its original contents, gardens and dependent estate buildings&quot;. The house, the landscaped gardens, park and woodlands are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, Grade II* being the second-highest listing, reserved for &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot;.

==Gardens==

The gardens and country park comprise of the estate with the gardens extending to . They were predominantly laid out from the 1860s, with later alterations and simplifications. Edward VII sought advice from William Broderick Thomas and Ferdinand de Rothschild, a friend and adviser to the King throughout his life. The original lake was filled and replaced with the elaborate parterres fashionable at the time. These have since been removed. Two new lakes were dug further from the house, and bordered by rockeries constructed of Pulhamite stone. A summerhouse, called &quot;The Nest&quot;, stands above the Upper Lake, a gift in 1913 to Queen Alexandra from the comptroller of her household, General Sir Dighton Probyn. The gardens to the north of the house, which are overlooked by the suite of rooms used by George VI, were remodelled and simplified by Geoffrey Jellicoe for the King and his wife after the Second World War. A statue of Father Time, dating from the 18th century, was purchased by the Queen Mother and installed in 1951. Further areas of the gardens were remodelled by Sir Eric Savill in the 1960s for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. The extensive kitchen gardens, which in Edward VII&#x27;s time included carriage drives to allow guests to view the &quot;highly ornamental&quot; arrangements, were also laid to lawn during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign, having proved uneconomic to maintain.
==Wider estate==

The Sandringham estate has some of the finest shoots in England, and is used for royal shooting parties. Covering seven villages, the estate&#x27;s other main activities, aside from tourism, are arable crops and forestry. The grounds provided room for Queen Alexandra&#x27;s menagerie of horses, dogs, cats, and other animals. In 1886 a racing pigeon loft was constructed for birds given to the Duke of York by King Leopold II of Belgium and one or more lofts for pigeons have been maintained ever since. The Norwich Gates, designed by Thomas Jeckyll and made by the local firm of Barnard, Bishop and Barnard, were a wedding present for Edward and Alexandra from &quot;the gentry of Norfolk&quot;.

In 2007 Sandringham House and its grounds were designated a protected site under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This makes it a criminal offence to trespass in the house or its grounds. The Sandringham estate has a museum in the former coach house with displays of royal life and estate history. The museum also houses an extensive collection of royal motor vehicles including a 1900 Daimler owned by Edward VII and a 1939 Merryweather &amp; Sons fire engine, made for the Sandringham fire brigade which was founded in 1865 and operated independently on the estate until 1968. The coach house stables and garaging were designed by A. J. Humbert at the same time as his construction of the main house. The estate contains several houses with close links to the royal family.

===Anmer Hall===

Anmer Hall is a Georgian house on the grounds, purchased by the Prince of Wales in 1896. Formerly occupied by the Duke of Kent, it was the main country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales, until their move to Adelaide Cottage at Windsor.

===Appleton House===
When Prince Carl of Denmark (later King Haakon VII of Norway) and Princess Maud were married in July 1896, Appleton House was a wedding gift to them from the bride&#x27;s parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Queen Maud became fond of Appleton, &quot;our little house is a perfect paradise&quot;, and their son, Prince Alexander (the future King Olav V of Norway), was born at the house in 1903. After Queen Maud died in 1938, King Haakon returned the property. The last inhabitants were King George VI and Queen Elizabeth who stayed there during a visit to Norfolk during World War II, when Sandringham was closed. Lascelles considered it &quot;an ugly villa, but not uncomfortable&quot;. The house was demolished in 1984.

===Park House===
Constructed by Edward VII, Park House has been owned by the royal family for many years. The birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales, when the house was let to her father, it was subsequently run as a hotel managed by the Leonard Cheshire charity. In 2019, the charity developed plans for a £2.3m refurbishment programme, which were deferred because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The charity has since decided to discontinue the redevelopment and work with the Sandringham Estate to exit the lease.

===Wood Farm===

Wood Farm has been part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII. In the early 20th century, it was home to Prince John, the youngest of the six children of King George V and Queen Mary. Born in 1905, the Prince was epileptic, and spent much of his short life in relative seclusion at Sandringham. He died at Wood Farm, his home for the last two years of his life, on 18 January 1919. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, lived at Wood Farm after retiring from royal duties.

===York Cottage===
York Cottage, originally known as Bachelors&#x27; Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham, in order to provide further accommodation for guests. It was home to George V from 1893 until his mother&#x27;s death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925. Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, told his father&#x27;s biographer Harold Nicolson, &quot;Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father&quot;. The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; James Pope-Hennessy, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, &quot;tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous&quot;. Nicolson described it as a &quot;glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home&quot;. He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: &quot;Oh my God! what a place. The King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables&quot;. &quot;It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house.&quot; Nicolson&#x27;s strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King. York Cottage is the estate office for the Sandringham Estate.

==Public access==
The country park and the visitors&#x27; centre are normally open throughout the year. The house, gardens and museum were usually opened annually from the end of March until the end of October, but COVID-19 led to the closure of much of the estate. Staged re-opening took place from February 2022. Following the death of Elizabeth II, Sandringham was closed for a period of official mourning. The country park subsequently reopened, but the house and garden remained closed to the public until April 2023.

<doc id="977879" wikidata="Q1028318" url="?curid=977879" title="Mrs Grundy">
<text>Mrs Grundy is a figurative name for an extremely conventional or priggish person, a personification of the tyranny of conventional propriety. A tendency to be overly fearful of what others might think is sometimes referred to as grundyism.

Mrs Grundy originated as an unseen character in Thomas Morton&#x27;s 1798 five-act comedy &quot;Speed the Plough&quot;. References to Mrs Grundy were eventually so well established in the public imagination that in Samuel Butler&#x27;s 1872 novel &quot;Erewhon&quot;, the goddess Ydgrun, an anagram for Grundy, dictates social norms. As a figure of speech, &quot;Mrs Grundy&quot; can be found throughout the English-speaking world.

==Original appearance==
Curiously for so famous a character, Mrs Grundy never actually appears in the play which introduced her, but is the continual object of the boastful Dame Ashfield&#x27;s envious watchfulness, as is shown in the very first scene:

:&quot;Ashfield.&quot; Well, Dame, welcome whoam. What news does thee bring vrom market?
:&quot;Dame.&quot; What news, husband? What I always told you; that Farmer Grundy&#x27;s wheat brought five shillings a quarter more than ours did.
:&quot;Ash.&quot; All the better vor he.
:&quot;Dame.&quot; Ah! the sun seems to shine on purpose for him.
:&quot;Ash.&quot; Come, come, missus, as thee hast not the grace to thank God for prosperous times, dan&#x27;t thee grumble when they be unkindly a bit.
:&quot;Dame.&quot; And I assure you, Dame Grundy&#x27;s butter was quite the crack of the market.
:&quot;Ash.&quot; Be quiet, woolye? aleways ding, dinging Dame Grundy into my ears — what will Mrs Grundy zay? What will Mrs Grundy think — Canst thee be quiet, let ur alone, and behave thyzel pratty?
:&quot;Dame.&quot; Certainly I can — I&#x27;ll tell thee, Tummas, what she said at church last Sunday.
:&quot;Ash.&quot; Canst thee tell what parson zaid? Noa — Then I&#x27;ll tell thee — A&#x27; zaid that envy were as foul a weed as grows, and cankers all wholesome plants that be near it — that&#x27;s what a&#x27; zaid.
:&quot;Dame.&quot; And do you think I envy Mrs Grundy indeed?

Although later usage positions her chiefly as a feared dispenser of disapproval, the Mrs Grundy of the play is, in Dame Ashfield&#x27;s daydreams, not so much a figure of dread as a cowed audience to the accomplishments of the Ashfield family. As the play progresses, Dame Ashfield and her comical musings soon drop from sight to make way for melodrama.

==Victorian heyday==
With the Victorian era, its new morality of decency, domesticity, serious-mindedness, propriety and community discipline on the one hand, its humbug, hypocrisy and self-deception on the other, Mrs Grundy swiftly rose to a position of censorious authority. In John Poole&#x27;s 1841 novel &quot;Phineas Quiddy&quot;, Poole wrote &quot;Many people take the entire world to be one huge Mrs. Grundy, and, upon every act and circumstance of their lives, please, or torment themselves, according to the nature of it, by thinking of what that huge Mrs. Grundy, the World, will say about it&quot;. In 1869, John Stuart Mill, himself very aware of the potentially tyrannical power of social opprobrium, referred to Mrs Grundy in &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, noting that &quot;Whoever has a wife and children has given hostages to Mrs. Grundy&quot;.

Butler in his 1872 &quot;Erewhon&quot; noted of Ydgrun that &quot;she was held to be both omnipresent and omnipotent; but she was not an elevated conception, and was sometimes both cruel and absurd&quot;. His own preference was for the small group he called High Ydgrunites, who broadly accepted the low-norm conventions of the goddess, but were capable of rising above Mrs Grundy and her claims, if need be.

With the fin de siècle erosion of the Victorian moral consensus, Mrs Grundy began to lose her power, and by the 1920s she was already little more than a faded laughing-stock, being mocked for example in the advice book for teens, &quot;Mrs Grundy is Dead&quot; (New York: Century, 1930). A later appearance as the whitehaired schoolteacher in Archie comics in 1941, however, has kept the name alive.

==Linguistic associations==
While not strictly onomatopoeia, the name &#x27;Grundy&#x27; nevertheless has sound associations with underlying mental dissatisfaction as evidenced linguistically in words such as &#x27;grumble&#x27;, &#x27;mumble&#x27;, &#x27;grunt&#x27;, and &#x27;gruntled&#x27;.

&quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot; places Grundyism under prudery, linked most closely to euphemism.

==Examples==
*C. S. Lewis&#x27;s character Mark Studdock in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; refers to her in a ghost-written article for an unnamed British periodical (which is intended to promote the interests of a group of Satanists). &quot;If you hear anyone talking about the liberties of England (by which he means the liberties of the obscurantists, the Mrs. Grundies, the bishops, and the capitalists), watch that man. He&#x27;s the enemy.&quot;
*Aldous Huxley refers to her in the essay &quot;To the Puritan All Things Are Impure&quot; in his book &quot;Music at Night&quot;.
*Walter de la Mare described her in his poem of that title: &quot;High-coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave but grim, A large flat face, eyes keenly dim, staring at nothing ... on each of those chairs has gloated in righteousness&quot;.
*Aimée Crocker refers to her throughout her autobiography &quot;And I&#x27;d Do It Again&quot;.
*P. T. Barnum refers to her in the preface to his non-fiction booklet &quot;Art of Money Getting&quot; (1880).
*Oscar Wilde in a letter to the &quot;St. James Gazette&quot; describes her as &quot;Mrs Grundy, that amusing old lady who represents the only original form of humour that the middle classes of this country have been able to produce&quot; (1890).
*Charles Dickens mentions her in his novel &quot;Hard Times&quot;.
*William Makepeace Thackeray mentions her in his novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.
*William Gilbert refers to her in the patter song &quot;At the outset I may mention it&#x27;s my sovereign intention&quot; in the second act of &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, and in the (cut) song &quot;Though men of rank may useless seem&quot; for the Duke in &quot;Patience (opera)&quot;.
*George Gissing wrote a novel, &quot;Mrs Grundy&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, which was never published and is now lost.
*G. K. Chesterton mentions her in chapter III of &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; and titled a chapter &quot;The Humility of Mrs Grundy&quot; in his book &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With the World&quot;.
*Lewis Carroll often refers to &quot;Mrs Grundy&quot; in his letters as a characterization of those who may disapprove of his friendships with children.
*James Joyce refers to her in the &quot;Eumaeus&quot; chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Gifford&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; characterizes her as &quot;the ultimate arbiter of stuffy middle-class propriety&quot;.
*Robert A. Heinlein also mentions her, for example, in his novels &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, and in the second intermission of &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;. &quot;Freedom begins when you tell Mrs. Grundy to go fly a kite.&quot;
*Philip José Farmer&#x27;s characters in the Riverworld series also refer to Mrs Grundy as prudishness incarnate in a negative way.
*Peter Fryer&#x27;s book &quot;Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery&quot; concerns prudish behaviour, such as the use of euphemisms for underwear.
*Jack London uses Mrs Grundy in his books &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;. In the former he describes the early twentieth century attitude of the English working class towards drunkenness: &quot;Mrs Grundy rules as supremely over the workers as she does over the bourgeoisie; but in the case of the workers, the one thing she does not frown upon is the public house ... Mrs Grundy drew the line at spirits.&quot; In &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;, on the 1st page of chapter 10, the protagonist says of his race that it&#x27;s, &quot;...sober-minded, clean-lived, and fanatically moral and which in this latter connection has culminated among the English in the Reformed Church and Mrs. Grundy&quot;.
*Mohandas Gandhi refers to Mrs Grundy as an unsuitable reason to end his *brahmacharya* experiment.
*Louisa May Alcott alludes to Mrs Grundy in her book &quot;Little Women&quot; when speaking of the changes Laurie undergoes as a result of Amy&#x27;s admonitions to him (1868).
*Anthony Trollope&#x27;s character Lady Glencora in &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; says, &quot;Sometimes I wish there were no such things as looks. I don&#x27;t mean anything improper, you know; only one does get so hampered, right and left, for fear of Mrs Grundy.&quot;
*Martin Seymour-Smith refers to Mrs Grundy throughout his biography of Thomas Hardy, noting the writer&#x27;s struggles with what he called &quot;an unexpected Grundian cloud… &#x27;excessive prudery&#x27;&quot;.
*Thomas Hardy disparages the &quot;Grundyist&quot; in his essay &quot;Candour in English Fiction&quot; (1890).
*Walter Lippmann dismisses the &quot;exploded pretensions of Mr and Mrs Grundy&quot; in his &quot;A Preface to Politics&quot; (1913).
* On the British television show &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, the prudish Saffron is called a Mrs Grundy by Patsy, a hedonist.
* A long-time character in Archie Comics is the teacher Miss Grundy. When first introduced, she fit the Mrs Grundy archetype well, being judgmental and old-fashioned. However, the character has been softened considerably over the years, and her current incarnation is not particularly Grundyesque.
*P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s lyrics to the song &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; from the musical &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; contain the line &quot;What would Missus Grundy say?&quot; in Verse 1.
*H. G. Wells&#x27;s character Ewart in the novel &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot;, during a long dialogue about the Grundys says, &quot;There&#x27;s no Mrs Grundy.&quot; (book 1 chapter 4, section iii)
* Vladimir Nabokov refers to Mrs Grundy in his novel &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot; (1941).
* Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy refer to &quot;Mrs Grundy&quot; in Chapter 12 of &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; (2nd Edition, 2009).
* Harry Turtledove refer to &quot;Mrs Grundy&quot; in Chapter 3 of &quot;&quot;.
* E. M. Forster - The Clever Lady says &quot;If it is Mrs Grundy who is troubling you...&quot; in Chapter 2 of A Room with a View, and &quot;Grundyism&quot; generally in &quot;Two Cheers for Democracy&quot;.
* Patrick O&#x27;Brian in &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; describes Jack Aubrey&#x27;s wife as &quot;...completely different. She was not a prude, and she cared no more for Mrs Grundy than Diana...&quot;
* Vesta Tilley&#x27;s song &quot;Bazaar Maids&quot; refers to all the pretty, witty girls &quot;under Mother Grundy&#x27;s laws&quot;.
* John Galsworthy refers to an English family holidaying in Switzerland as &quot;English Grundys&quot; in his novel &quot;The Dark Flower&quot; (1913).
