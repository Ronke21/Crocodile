<text>Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry, (13 May 1878 – 10 February 1949), styled Lord Stewart until 1884 and Viscount Castlereagh between 1884 and 1915, was a British peer and politician. He is best remembered in Great Britain for his tenure as Secretary of State for Air in the 1930s and for his attempts to reach an understanding with Nazi Germany. In 1935, he was removed from the Air Ministry but retained in the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. In Ireland, especially within Ulster, Lord Londonderry is best remembered for his opposition to Home Rule for Ireland in the early twentieth century.

==Background and education==
The eldest son of Charles, 6th Marquess of Londonderry, and Lady Theresa Chetwynd-Talbot, a daughter of the 19th Earl of Shrewsbury, he was educated at Eton and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His father&#x27;s family was partly of Donegal Ulster-Scots descent.

==Early career==
On 22 May 1895, Lord Castlereagh was appointed a second lieutenant in the 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps, a corps within the Volunteer Force attached to the Royal Garrison Artillery (Western Division) and at the time commanded by his father who owned Seaham Colliery from which many of the part-time gunners were recruited. After passing out from Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards as a second lieutenant on 8 September 1897. He was promoted lieutenant on 30 August 1899, and appointed adjutant on 9 May 1900.

In early 1901 he was appointed by King Edward VII to take part in a special diplomatic mission to announce the King&#x27;s accession to the governments of Austria-Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. In August 1903, following the King&#x27;s visit to Ireland, he was appointed a Member Fourth Class (present-day Lieutenant) of the Royal Victorian Order, his father being honoured with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order at the same time. He resigned his position of adjutant in the Royal Horse Guards on 24 March 1904, and was promoted to captain on 6 April.

Castlereagh was subsequently pressed by his parents to stand for election to the House of Commons at the 1906 general election for Maidstone. He retained his army commission but was placed on the half-pay list from January 1910. His relatively unsuccessful career on the depleted Unionist backbenches was broken by a return to the British Army during the First World War.

==First World War==
As Captain Castlereagh MP he travelled to northern France in the first weeks of the war and reached Paris on 29 August 1914, having been gazetted ADC to General William Pulteney the previous day. Although a staff officer, Castlereagh immediately saw plenty of fighting and believed he had shot and killed one of the enemy on 2 September 1914. In the following months of 1914, Castlereagh extensively witnessed the destruction of war and the terrible suffering of the British wounded. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major in his old regiment on 1 November, and to the substantive rank on the 7th.

Hitherto reluctant to involve himself, like his father, in Irish politics, the war prompted him to take up the cause of recruitment in Ireland. With his father&#x27;s death in February 1915, he ceased to be MP for Maidstone and inherited the Londonderry title and the immense wealth and status that went with it. His exalted position helped his political career, not least in Ireland, which later brought him favourable attention from the British government. In 1915, Lord Londonderry (as he had now become) ll, was mentioned in despatches and rejoined his regiment, the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues). He saw in 1915 for the first time the horrific effects of gas attack upon human beings when visiting soldiers gassed at the first Battle of Ypres.

In 1916 Londonderry was appointed second-in-command of The Blues, part of the 8th Cavalry Brigade. He served at the front during the Battle of the Somme, witnessing the mass slaughter first-hand; his closest friend, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Brassey, best man at his wedding in 1899, was killed. He was an acting lieutenant colonel from 15 December 1916 to 20 January 1917.
In 1917, Londonderry took command of a composite battalion drawn from the 8th Cavalry Brigade with the brevet rank of Lt-Colonel, and the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues) took part in the massed mounted cavalry attacks on Monchy-le-Preux on the morning of 11 April 1917, during the Battle of Arras. Monchy-le-Preux was one of the keys to the northern end of the Hindenburg Line. While reconnoitring the enemy near Monchy the GOC 8th Cavalry Brigade, Brigadier-General Charles Bulkeley-Johnson, was shot in the face; he fell with a piercing shriek, the thirtieth British General to be killed in action or to die of wounds on the Western Front. This put Brevet Lt-Colonel Londonderry temporarily in command of the 8th Cavalry Brigade during their charge in the Battle of Arras. At Monchy 600 cavalrymen were casualties and many more horses died. The animals were tethered in the open, as their riders took cover; attempts to take them to the rear during a &quot;box barrage&quot; only increased the casualties. For Londonderry, the experiences of war and the carnage of his brother officers and the family and school friends he grew up with would, as Ian Kershaw commented, &quot;leave an indelible mark on him&quot;.

After serving in the Irish Convention of 1917–18, Lord Londonderry served on the short-lived Viceroy&#x27;s Advisory Council, meeting at Dublin Castle in the autumn of 1918. Promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 7 November 1918, he retired from the army on 10 September 1919 as a major and brevet lieutenant-colonel.

On 13 August 1920, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 55th Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery in the Territorial Army, the successor unit to his father&#x27;s 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteers. He continued in that role until World War II, after it had been converted into the 63rd (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in Anti-Aircraft Command.

==In the Northern Ireland cabinet==
He was appointed to the new Air Council at Westminster in 1919 by the postwar coalition government. Promoted to Under-Secretary of State for Air in 1920, Londonderry was nevertheless frustrated and took advantage of his Ulster connections to join the first Cabinet of the Government of Northern Ireland in June 1921, as Leader of the Senate of Northern Ireland and Minister of Education for Northern Ireland. Londonderry was particularly interested in education, and favoured a secularised interest, not the least as a way to end Catholic education. Lord Londonderry appointed the Lynn Commission, headed by Robert Lynn, for advice about education. Lynn stated during the commission&#x27;s hearings his belief that it would be a waste of public funds to teach the Irish language in the schools, a proposal that was widely seen as promoting Unionism, and led to a Catholic boycott of the commission.

In 1923, his Education Act sought to advance the prospect of mixed Protestant-Catholic education by permitting religious instruction only after school hours and with parental consent. Both Protestant and Catholic educational interests objected, and the measure was amended in 1925 to the point that its purpose, to secularise schooling in Northern Ireland, was lost. 

In 1926, Londonderry resigned from the Government of Northern Ireland and, in 1929, he left the Parliament of Northern Ireland entirely.

== In the British Cabinet ==
Londonderry was to involve himself in the General Strike of 1926, playing the role of a moderate mine owner, a stance made easier for him by the relative success of the Londonderry mines in County Durham. His performance earned him high praise, and along with the Londonderrys&#x27; role as leading political hosts, he was rewarded by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin with a seat in the Cabinet in 1928 as First Commissioner of Works. Londonderry was invited to join the emergency National Government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Lord President Baldwin in 1931. That was the cause of some scandal as MacDonald&#x27;s many critics accused the erstwhile Labour leader of being too friendly with Edith, Lady Londonderry.

When the National Government won the 1931 General Election he returned to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Air (Londonderry held a pilot&#x27;s licence). This position became increasingly important during his tenure, not least due to the deliberations of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference at Geneva. In September 1931, Japan seized the Manchuria region of China, setting up the sham state of Manchukuo while making claims to the effect that the rest of China was in the exclusive Japanese sphere of influence, an interpretation that the Chinese government vehemently objected to. In January 1932, the First Battle of Shanghai began which saw the Japanese bomb much of Shanghai into rubble. The scenes of Shanghai in flames together with the increasingly assertive Japanese claims about China and the Far East in general as within its sphere of influence convinced Londonderry that Britain needed a strong Royal Air Force as the best way to deter Japan from attacking the British empire and to ensure that Britain was prepared for war should Anglo-Japanese relations take a turn for the worse.

Londonderry&#x27;s record at the Air Ministry has been outlined by a biographer:
Londonderry toed the British government&#x27;s equivocal line on disarmament but opposed in Cabinet any moves that would risk the deterrent value of the Royal Air Force. He was thus attacked by Clement Attlee and the Labour Party and became a liability to the National Government. In the spring of 1935, he was removed from the Air Ministry but retained in the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. Combined with his role as a leading member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, he attracted the popular nickname of &quot;Londonderry Herr&quot;.

== Contacts with Nazi Germany ==
The sense of hurt Lord Londonderry felt at that and accusations that he had misled Baldwin about the strength of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; led him to seek to clear his reputation as a &quot;warmonger&quot; by engaging in amateur diplomacy. The British historian Richard Griffiths made a distinction between appeasers, a term that he reserved for government officials who believed in appeasement of the Axis states for a variety of reasons, many quite pragmatic, and the enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, which he described a group of individuals who acting on their own as private citizens sought better relations with the Third Reich, usually for ideological reasons.
Griffiths defined Londonderry as an enthusiast for Nazi Germany, instead of an appeaser, by noting that after June 1935, Londonderry was speaking mostly for himself when he sought out the company of Nazi leaders. Londonderry joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, a society that sought to bring together elites from Britain and Germany with the aim of forging an Anglo-German alliance.

William Shirer, an American reporter assigned to Berlin in the years leading to the Second World War, referred to Londonderry simply as &quot;an all-out pro-Nazi.&quot;

Between January 1936 and September 1938, Londonderry made six visits to Nazi Germany, the first lasting for three weeks, but a seventh invitation that had been accepted for March 1939 was abruptly declined by Londonderry after the Nazi occupation of Prague. From early 1936 onward, Londonderry&#x27;s public statements about the Third Reich became markedly admiring and sympathetic. In March 1936, Leopold von Hoesch, the German ambassador in London in a report to Berlin called Londonderry &quot;one of those on whom the German government relied for the right opinions&quot;. As part of his amateur diplomacy, at the end of May 1936 Londonderry invited in Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, later the German foreign minister, to his ancestral home in Northern Ireland, Mount Stewart. Ribbentrop is reported to have landed in Newtownards with a &quot;noisy gang of SS men&quot; and the four-day visit became a national newspaper story.
Londonderry entertained Ribbentrop for a further four days at his family home in County Durham, Wynyard Hall on 13–17 November and accompanied him to briefings with government officials in London.

During the first two visits, prior to the abdication of Edward VIII, whom the Nazis assessed as a supporter, Londonderry was considered an aristocrat of real influence by Hitler. The friendly regard in which Londonderry was held in Berlin was reflected in Hitler indiscreetly informing his guest, in October 1936, of his intended moves both on Czechoslovakia and Poland, years before two invasions happened.

Although Londonderry immediately passed that information regarding Hitler&#x27;s indicated future direction of German policy on to a member of the British government by a letter to Lord Halifax on 24 December 1936,
rearmament was not notably accelerated in Britain. In the end, Londonderry&#x27;s high-profile promotion of Anglo-German friendship marked him with a far greater slur than what had led him to engage in appeasement in the first place.

==Fall from grace==
Under attack from anti-Nazis inside and outside Westminster, Lord Londonderry attempted to explain his position by publishing &quot;Ourselves and Germany&quot; in March 1938. Then, after the Munich agreement, in October 1938, Londonderry wrote in a letter that he was aware that Hitler was &quot;gradually getting back to the theories which he evolved in prison&quot;, when working on &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Londonderry&#x27;s work was openly antisemitic, declaring: &quot;I have no great affection for the Jews ... it is possible to trace their participation in most of the international disturbances which have created so much havoc in different countries.&quot;

After playing a marginal role in the resignation of Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister in 1940, he failed to win any favour from the new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (his second cousin), who thought little of his talents. With talk of his possible internment, Londonderry retreated to Mount Stewart, where he produced &quot;Wings of Destiny&quot; (1943), a relatively short memoir that was considerably censured by some of his former colleagues, and where he died in 1949.

On the mantlepiece of his smoking room at Mount Stewart, Londonderry retained a memento of his diplomatic démarche: an Allach porcelain figurine of an &quot;SS Fahnenträger&quot; (SS flag bearer). The gift from &quot;Reichmarshall&quot; Hermann Göring was neither destroyed nor removed at the outbreak of war.

Lord Londonderry served as Lord Lieutenant of County Down between 1915 and 1949 and of County Durham between 1928 and 1949 and was Chancellor of the University of Durham and The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. He was Mayor of Durham during the year of George VI&#x27;s Coronation (1937). He was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1918, of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland in 1921 and of the Imperial Privy Council in 1925 and appointed a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1919.

==Family==
On 28 November 1899, Lord Londonderry married the Hon. Edith Helen Chaplin, eldest daughter of Henry Chaplin, 1st Viscount Chaplin, and Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (herself a daughter of the 3rd Duke of Sutherland) at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Eaton Square and had issue:

Lauritzen, of River Forest, Illinois, U.S.A., founder of a food manufacturing, processing and export firm, and has issue.

Lord Londonderry had an illegitimate daughter with actress Fannie Ward, named Dorothé Mabel Lewis (b. 1900). She first married, in 1918, a nephew of mining magnate Barney Barnato, Capt. Jack Barnato, who died of pneumonia shortly after their wedding. Her second husband, whom she married in 1922, was Terence Plunket, 6th Baron Plunket, and with him, she had three sons: Patrick Plunket, 7th Baron Plunket, Robin Plunket, 8th Baron Plunket, and the Hon Shaun Plunket. Lord and Lady Plunket were killed in an aircraft crash in California in 1938.

Having suffered a stroke after a gliding accident a few years after the end of the war, Lord Londonderry died on 10 February 1949 at Mount Stewart, County Down, aged 70.

<text>David Bloor (; born 1942) is a British sociologist. He is a professor in, and a former director of, the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh. He is a key figure in the Edinburgh school and played a major role in the development of the field of science and technology studies. He is best known for advocating the strong programme in the sociology of scientific knowledge, most notably in his book &quot;Knowledge and Social Imagery&quot;.

==Biography==

He was born in Derby. He started his academic career in philosophy and psychology. In 1972 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis &quot;Speech and the regulation of behaviour.&quot; In the 1970s he and Barry Barnes were the major figures of the strong programme, which put forward queries against &quot;philosophical a priorism&quot; in the understanding of scientific knowledge. This is an approach, popular in the philosophy of science, that simply precluded inquiries about science by treating successful scientific knowledge as simply true or rational without empirically investigating how such knowledge has come to be accepted as true or rational. Bloor&#x27;s book &quot;Knowledge and Social Imagery&quot; (Routledge, 1976) is one of the key texts of the strong programme.

Bloor wrote extensively on the Kuhn/Popper debate, and is a representative figure of the sociology of scientific knowledge. In the 1980s when French scholars like Bruno Latour developed the actor-network theory (partially based on the strong programme), David Bloor strongly disagreed with the ANT camp when they argued that human and non-humans should be treated in an equivalent manner, going so far as to write an article entitled &quot;Anti-Latour&quot;.

He was awarded the John Desmond Bernal Prize by the Society for Social Studies of Science in 1996 in recognition of his distinguished contribution to the field.

<doc id="993532" wikidata="Q477296" url="?curid=993532" title="Broken Arrow (1950 film)">
<text>Broken Arrow is a 1950 American revisionist Western film directed by Delmer Daves and starring James Stewart, Jeff Chandler, and Debra Paget. The film is based on historical figures, but fictionalizes their story in dramatized form. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, and won a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Film Promoting International Understanding&quot;. Film historians have said that the film was one of the first major Westerns since the Second World War to portray Native Americans sympathetically.

==Plot==
Tom Jeffords comes across a wounded 14-year-old Apache boy dying from buckshot wounds in his back. The boy first tries to attack him, not believing it possible that a White man would want to help him, but Jeffords gives the boy water and treats his wounds, staying with him until he heals. The Apache boy is surprised at his goodwill as he is a White man and supposed to be his enemy. The boy&#x27;s tribesmen appear and are initially hostile, but decide to let Jeffords go free after the boy convinces them that he is a “good” White man who helped him rather than kill him. However, when a group of gold prospectors approaches, the Apache gag Jeffords and tie him to a tree. Helpless, he watches as they attack the prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors then let him go, but warn him not to enter Apache territory again.

When Jeffords returns to Tucson, he encounters a prospector who escaped the ambush. He corrects a man&#x27;s exaggerated account of the attack, but Ben Slade is incredulous and does not see why Jeffords did not kill the Apache boy. They have a contentious confrontation and Jeffords defends his choice to do the right thing, no matter who it was for. Jeffords turns down the army&#x27;s request to scout Apache territory for them and instead learns the Apache language and customs from an Apache guide who lives amongst the townspeople. He plans to go to the Apache leader Cochise&#x27;s stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt, who is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. The mail has not been getting through because of Apache raids and Jeffords thinks this would be a good place to begin a peace treaty. He enters the Apache stronghold and begins a parley with Cochise, who agrees to let the mail couriers through after they realize their underlying morality is similar and Cochise is impressed by Jefford’s efforts to learn his language and his bravery for coming to him. Jeffords meets a young Apache woman, Sonseeahray, and they fall in love at first sight.

Despite Cochise agreeing to allow the mail to pass through, Apaches attack an army wagon train and kill the survivors, which was not part of their agreement. The townsfolk try to lynch Jeffords as a traitor for working with their enemies before he is saved by General Oliver Otis Howard who recruits him to negotiate a wider peace treaty with Cochise. Howard, the &quot;Christian General&quot; condemns racism, saying that the Bible &quot;says nothing about pigmentation of the skin&quot;. They make a peace treaty with Cochise, but a group led by Geronimo oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. When these renegades ambush a stagecoach, Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved with the Apaches’ help.

Jeffords and Sonseeahray marry in an Apache ceremony and have several days of tranquility. Ben Slade&#x27;s son comes to them, telling a story to Jeffords and Cochise about two of his horses stolen by Cochise&#x27;s people. Cochise says that his people did not take them and doubts his story, as he knows the boy&#x27;s father is an Apache hater. They nonetheless decide to go along with the boy up the canyon and are ambushed by the boy&#x27;s father and a gang of men from Tucson. Jeffords is shot and badly wounded and Sonseeahray is shot and killed, but Cochise kills most of the men, including Ben Slade. Cochise forbids Jeffords to retaliate, saying that the ambush was not done by the American military and that Geronimo broke the peace no less than Slade and his men, and that peace must be maintained. General Howard arrives with some of the townsfolk and informs Jeffords and Cochise that the men who survived the ambush and fled have been captured and will be executed for their crime. The townsfolk offer their condolences and apologize. Jeffords rides off with the belief that &quot;the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace, and from that day on wherever I went, in the cities, among the Apaches and in the mountains, I always remembered, my wife was with me&quot;.

==Production==
Producer Julian Blaustein recalled: &quot;We had a terrible time locating an actor with the proper voice and stature to play Cochise. Before we found Chandler we were even considering Ezio Pinza&quot;.

Jeff Chandler was cast in May 1949 on the basis of his performance in &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot;. He was working in several radio series at the time, &quot;Michael Shayne&quot; and &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, and had to be written out of them for several weeks.

Filming started on June 6, 1949. It was primarily shot on location in northern Arizona, approximately 30 miles south of Flagstaff. Apaches from the Whiteriver agency on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation played themselves. Debra Paget was only 16 years old when she played the love interest to 42-year-old James Stewart. Canadian Mohawk actor Jay Silverheels portrayed Geronimo.

The film was based on the 558-page novel &quot;Blood Brother&quot; (1947) by Elliott Arnold, which told the story of the peace agreement between the Apache leader Cochise and the U.S. Army, 1855–1874. The studio employed nearly 240 Native Americans from Arizona&#x27;s Fort Apache Indian Reservation; many location scenes were shot in Sedona, Arizona. The story of Cochise actually occurred in what is now the Dragoon Mountains in the Douglas Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest in southeastern Arizona. The studio attempted to portray Apache customs in the film, like the Social Dance and the Girl&#x27;s Sunrise Ceremony (the girl&#x27;s puberty rite). For the character of Cochise, director Daves eliminated the traditional style of broken English and replaced it with conventional English so that White Americans and Native Americans would sound alike. An overdub by the character of Jeffords opens the film with a statement about this.

==Portrayal of Native Americans==
Although many Western films of the pre-World War II period portrayed the Indigenous peoples of the Americas as hostile to the mostly White American settlers, others showed them in a positive light. &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; is noteworthy for being one of the first post-war Westerns to portray Native Americans in a balanced, sympathetic way, helping to bring in the era of the revisionist Western genre. The two principal Apache characters were played by non-Indigenous actors, with Brooklyn-born Jeff Chandler portraying Apache leader Cochise, and White American Debra Paget playing Jimmy Stewart’s Apache love interest. Notably, Native Canadian Mohawk actor Jay Silverheels played Geronimo, a small part in the film but recognized at the time as there were few Indigenous actors working in Hollywood. As well, the majority of extras were played by actual Apaches.

Some scholars have said that the film appealed to an ideal of tolerance and racial equality that would influence later Westerns and indicate Hollywood&#x27;s response to the evolving role of Native Americans in the society of the United States. &quot;Chronicle of the Cinema&quot; praised the film: &quot;Based on verifiable fact, it faithfully evokes the historical relationship between Cochise and Jeffords, marking a historical rehabilitation of Indians in the cinema&quot;.

In 1950, Rosebud Yellow Robe, a Native American folklorist, educator, and author, was hired by 20th Century Fox to undertake a national tour to promote the film. Yellow Robe explained that there were no such things as Native American princesses, and that the myth started when Pocahontas went to England and the English named her &quot;Lady Rebecca&quot;. Yellow Robe voiced complaints about the portrayals of Indians on radio, screen, and television to &quot;a new generation of children learning the old stereotypes about whooping, warring Indians, as if there weren&#x27;t anything else interesting about us&quot;.

<doc id="993533" wikidata="Q6014890" url="?curid=993533" title="Inclusionary zoning">
<text>Inclusionary zoning (IZ) is municipal and county planning ordinances that require or provide incentives when a given percentage of units in a new housing development be affordable by people with low to moderate incomes. Such housing is known as inclusionary housing. The term &quot;inclusionary&quot; zoning indicates that these ordinances seek to counter exclusionary zoning practices, which exclude low-cost housing from a municipality through the zoning code. (For example, single-family zoning makes it illegal to build multi-family apartment buildings.) Non-profit affordable housing developers build 100% of their units as affordable, but need significant taxpayer subsidies for this model to work. Inclusionary zoning allows municipalities to have new affordable housing constructed without taxpayer subsidies. In order to encourage for-profit developers to build projects that include affordable units, cities often allow developers to build more total units (a &quot;density bonus&quot;) than their zoning laws currently allow so that there will be enough profit generating market-rate units to offset the losses from the below market-rate units and still allow the project to be financially feasible. Inclusionary zoning can be mandatory or voluntary, though the great majority of units have been built as a result of mandatory programmes. There are variations among the set-aside requirements (percentage of units set-aside for low-income residents), affordability levels (what income level is considered &quot;low-income&quot;), and length of time the unit is deed-restricted as affordable housing.

In practice, these policies involve placing deed restrictions on 10–30% of new houses or apartments in order to make the cost of the housing affordable to lower-income households. The mix of &quot;affordable housing&quot; and &quot;market-rate&quot; housing in the same neighborhood is seen as beneficial by city planners and sociologists. Another goal of inclusionary zoning is to build mixed-income communities, rather than having poor households concentrated in specific city neighborhoods. Economists state that IZ functions as a price control on a percentage of units and has similar negative effects as other price controls (rent control) being that it discourages the supply of new housing. It can also be understood similar to impact fees as an &quot;inclusionary tax&quot; on market-rate units which raises the prices of new non-price-controlled units in that development and thereby diminishes the financial incentive to create new housing.

Most inclusionary zoning is enacted at the municipal or county level; when imposed by the state, as in Massachusetts, it has been argued that such laws usurp local control. In such cases, developers can use inclusionary zoning to avoid certain aspects of local zoning laws.

== Historical background ==
During the mid- to late-20th century, new suburbs grew and expanded around American cities as middle-class house buyers, supported by federal loan programs such as Veterans Administration housing loan guarantees, left established neighborhoods and communities. These newly populated places were generally more economically homogeneous than the cities they encircled. Many suburban communities enacted local ordinances, often in zoning codes, to preserve the character of their municipality. One of the most commonly cited exclusionary practices is the stipulation that lots must be of a certain minimum size and houses must be set back from the street a certain minimum distance. In many cases, these housing ordinances prevented affordable housing from being built, because the large plots of land required to build within the code restrictions were cost-prohibitive for modestly priced houses. Communities have remained accessible to wealthier citizens because of these ordinances, effectively shutting the low income families out of desirable communities. Such zoning ordinances have not always been enacted with conscious intent to exclude lower income households, but it has been the unintended result of such policies.

By denying lower income families access to suburban communities, many feel that exclusionary zoning has contributed to the maintenance of inner city ghettos. Supporters of inclusionary zoning point out that low income households are more likely to become economically successful if they have middle class neighbors as peers and role models. When effective, inclusionary zoning reduces the concentration of poverty in slum districts where social norms may not provide adequate models of success. Education is one of the largest components in the effort to lift people out of poverty; access to high-quality public schools is another key benefit of reduced segregation. Statistically, a poor child in a school where 80% of the children are poor scores 13–15% lower compared to environments where the poor child&#x27;s peers are 80% middle class. But this poor child, unlike their middle-class peers in market-rate housing, loses out on intergenerational wealth.

In many of the communities where inclusionary zoning has been put into practice, income requirements allow households that earn 80–120% of the median income to qualify for the &quot;affordable&quot; housing. This is because in many places high housing prices have prevented even median-income households from buying market-rate properties. This is especially prominent in California, where only 16% of the population could afford the median-priced home during 2005.

== Potential benefits and limitations of IZ Policies ==

=== Potential benefits ===
* Poor and working families would have access to a range of opportunities, including good employment opportunities, good schools, comprehensive transportation system and safe streets 
* Alleviating the problem of inadequate supply of Affordable Housing 
* Avoiding economic and racial segregation, which helps reducing crime rate, failing schools and improving social stability
* Relatively small amount of public subsidies required for adopting IZ as a market-based tool 

=== Potential limitations ===
* Low production of affordable housings, which produced approximately 150,000 units over several decades nationwide, comparing to other schemes, such as Housing Choice Vouchers that helps approximately two million households and the LIHTC program that has produced over two million affordable homes
* Unstable production of affordable housing that highly affected by local housing-market conditions 
* Very little research on outcomes for participants in these programs. Although these affordable housing programs, by definition, offer lower-cost units that municipalities promote as inclusive, the deed restrictions imposed on participants in these programs result in additional economic disparities and other hardships not faced by market-rate homeowners.

== Economics ==
Economists state that IZ functions as a price control on a percentage of units and has similar negative effects as other price controls (rent control) being that it discourages the supply of new housing. It can also be understood similar to impact fees as an &quot;inclusionary tax&quot; on market-rate units which raises the prices of new non-price-controlled units in that development and thereby diminishes the financial incentive to create new housing.

== Differences in ordinances ==
Inclusionary zoning ordinances vary substantially among municipalities. These variables can include:

* Mandatory or voluntary ordinance. While many cities require inclusionary housing, many more offer zoning bonuses, expedited permits, reduced fees, cash subsidies, or other incentives for developers who voluntarily build affordable housing.
* Percentage of units to be dedicated as inclusionary housing. This varies quite substantially among jurisdictions, but appears to range from 10 to 30%.
* Minimum size of development that the ordinance applies to. Most jurisdictions exempt smaller developments, but some require that even developments incurring only a fraction of an inclusionary housing unit pay a fee (see below).
* Whether inclusionary housing must be built on site. Some programs allow housing to be built nearby, in cases of hardship.
* Whether fees can be paid in lieu of building inclusionary housing. Fees-in-lieu allow a developer to &quot;buy out&quot; of an inclusionary housing obligation. This may seem to defeat the purpose of inclusionary zoning, but in some cases the cost of building one affordable unit on-site could purchase several affordable units off-site.
* Income level or price defined as &quot;affordable,&quot; and buyer qualification methods. Most ordinances seem to target inclusionary units to low- or moderate-income households which earn approximately the regional median income or somewhat below. Inclusionary housing typically does not create housing for those with very low incomes.
*Whether inclusionary housing units are limited by price or by size (the City of Johannesburg for example provides for both options)
* Appearance and integration of inclusionary housing units. Many jurisdictions require that inclusionary housing units be indistinguishable from market-rate units, but this can increase costs.
* Longevity of price restrictions attached to inclusionary housing units, and allowable appreciation. Ordinances that allow the &quot;discount&quot; to expire essentially grant a windfall profit, similar to what market-rate owners would get. Municipalities dislike this because it would mean they would have to create more affordable units. Instead, participants in these programs subsidize themselves, relieving municipalities of the financial burden to keep these programs running. However, placing the brunt of the work and subsidies on the people in these programs raises questions. It can trap individuals in public housing programs, making it nearly impossible for them to move out until they pass away. If they could not afford market-rate housing 15 years ago, staying in a unit that restricts appreciation becomes a significant barrier to leaving public housing. In addition, requiring participants to do maintenance and take on all other homeowner liabilities on a home that is economically similar to a rental (since there is limited appreciation minus HOA fees, interest, taxes, etc.) can add further housing related stress. 
* Whether housing rehabilitation counts as &quot;construction,&quot; either of market-rate or affordable units. Some cities, like New York City, allow developers to count rehabilitation of off-site housing as an inclusionary contribution.
* Which types of housing construction the ordinance applies to. For example, high-rise housing costs more to build per square foot (thus raising compliance costs, perhaps prohibitively), so some ordinances exempt it from compliance.

== Alternative solutions ==
While many suburban communities feature Section 8 for low income households, they are generally restricted to concentrated sections. In some cases, counties specify small districts where Section 8 properties are to be rented. In other cases, the market tends to self-segregate property by income. For instance, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a wealthy suburban county bordering Philadelphia, only 5% of the county&#x27;s population live in the borough of Norristown, yet 50% of the county&#x27;s Section 8 properties are located there. The large low income resident population burdens Norristown&#x27;s local government and school district, while much of the county remains unburdened.

Inclusionary zoning aims to reduce residential economic segregation by mandating that a mix of incomes be represented in a single development.

== Controversy ==
Inclusionary zoning remains a controversial issue. Some affordable housing advocates seek to promote the policies in order to ensure that housing is available for a variety of income levels in more places. These supporters hold that inclusionary zoning produces needed affordable housing and creates income-integrated communities.

Yet other Affordable Housing advocates state the reverse is true, that Inclusionary Zoning can have the opposite effect and actually reduce affordable housing in a community. For example, in Los Angeles, California, inclusionary zoning apparently accelerated gentrification, as older, unprofitable buildings were razed and replaced with mostly high-rent housing, and a small percentage of affordable housing; the net result was less affordable housing. In New York, NY, inclusionary zoning allows for up to a 400% increase in luxury housing for every unit of affordable housing and for an additional 400% luxury housing when combined with the liberal use of development rights. Critics have stated the affordable housing can be directed to those making up to $200,000 through the improper use of an Area Median Income, and used as political tools by organizations tied to various politicians. New York City communities such as Harlem, the Lower East Side, Williamsburg, Chelsea and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen have experienced significant secondary displacement through the use of Inclusionary Zoning.

Real Estate industry detractors note that inclusionary zoning levies an indirect tax on developers, so as to discourage them from building in areas that face supply shortages. Furthermore, to ensure that the affordable units are not resold for profit, deed restrictions generally fix a long-term resale price ceiling, eliminating a potential benefit of home ownership.

Free market advocates oppose attempts to fix given social outcomes by government intervention in markets. They argue inclusionary zoning constitutes an onerous land use regulation that exacerbates housing shortages.

Homeowners sometimes note that their property values will be reduced if low income families move into their community. Others counter consider their concerns thinly-concealed classism and racism.

Some of the most widely publicized inclusionary zoning battles have involved the REIT AvalonBay Communities. According to the company&#x27;s website, AvalonBay seeks to develop properties in &quot;high barrier-to-entry markets&quot; across the United States. In practice, AvalonBay uses inclusionary zoning laws, such as the Massachusetts Comprehensive Permit Act: Chapter 40B, to bypass local zoning laws and build large apartment complexes. In some cases, local residents fight back with a lawsuit. In Connecticut, similar developments by AvalonBay have resulted in attempts to condemn the land or reclaim it by eminent domain. In most cases AvalonBay has won these disputes and built extremely profitable apartments or condominiums.

Other legal battles have occurred in California, where many cities have implemented inclusionary zoning policies that typically require 10 percent to 15 percent of units to be affordable housing. The definition of affordable housing includes both low-income housing and moderate-income housing. In California, low-income housing is typically designed for households making 51 percent to 80 percent of the median income, and moderate-income housing is typically for households making 81 percent to 120 percent of the median income. Developers have attempted to fight back these requirements by challenging local inclusionary zoning ordinances through the court legal system. In the case &quot;Home Builders Association of Northern California v. City of Napa&quot;, the California First District Court of Appeal upheld the inclusionary zoning ordinances of City of Napa that require 10 percent of units of the new development project to be moderate income housing against the Home Builders Association that challenged the City of Napa. Cities have also attempted to impose inclusionary requirements on rental units. However, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act prohibits cities in California from imposing limitation on rental rates on vacant units. Subsequently, developers have won cases, such as &quot;Palmer/Sixth Street Properties, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2009)&quot;, against cities that imposed inclusionary requirements on rental units, as the state law supersedes local ordinances.

Citizen groups and developers have also sought other ways to strengthen or defeat inclusionary zoning laws. For example, the initiative and referendum process in California allows citizen groups or developers to change local ordinances on affordable housing by popular vote. Any citizens or interest groups can participate in this process by gathering at least the required number of signatures so that the measure proposed can qualify to be on the ballot; once enough signatures are submitted and the ballot measure is cleared by election officials, the ballot measure is typically placed on the ballot for the upcoming election. One recent case is Proposition C in San Francisco. This ballot measure was placed on the ballot for the June 2016 California primary election. Passed in June 2016, this proposition amends the city&#x27;s charter to increase the requirement for affordable housing for development projects of 25 units or more.

The clash between these various interests is reflected in this study published by the libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation&#x27;s public policy think tank, and the response of a
peer review of that research. Local governments reflect and in some cases balance these competing interests. In California, the League of Cities has created a guide to inclusionary zoning which includes a section on the pros and cons of the policies.

== Failure in improving social integration coupled with increasing social cost ==
It is suggested that IZ policies may not effectively disperse low-income units throughout the region, which actually contradicts the aim of the policy itself. For instances in Suffolk County, it is found that there is a spatial concentration of IZ units in poor neighbourhood coupled with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic, which are considered the minorities. Furthermore, 97.7% of the IZ units were built in only 10% of the census tract from 1980 to 2000, which is area with the lowest-income neighbourhood coupled with clustering of minorities. It is indispensable to notice that housing policies is controlled by local government rather than regional government in Suffolk County, therefore without regional coordinations of housing policy, it fails to consider the inter-municipality distribution of low-income household within the county. Besides, density bonuses given to property developers for the provision of IZ units have intensified the concentration of affordable units in poor neighborhood (Ryan &amp; Enderle as cited in Mukhija, Das, Regus et al., 2012). This shows that IZ policies may fail to disperse the low-income distributions when it is carried out without taking regional coordination into account.

Moreover, with density bonuses allocated to property developers for the provision of IZ units, it implies the community would be bearing the cost of increasing population density and sharing existing infrastructure.

== In practice ==

=== Examples from the USA ===
More than 200 communities in the United States have some sort of inclusionary zoning provision.

Montgomery County, Maryland, is often held to be a pioneer in establishing inclusionary zoning policies. It is the sixth wealthiest county in the United States, yet it has built more than 10,000 units of affordable housing since 1974, many units door-to-door with market-rate housing.

All municipalities in the state of Massachusetts are subject to that state&#x27;s General Laws Chapter 40B, which allows developers to bypass certain municipal zoning restrictions in those municipalities which have fewer than the statutorily defined 10% affordable housing units. Developers taking advantage of Chapter 40B must construct 20% affordable units as defined under the statute.

All municipalities in the state of New Jersey are subject to judicially imposed inclusionary zoning as a result of the New Jersey Supreme Court&#x27;s Mount Laurel Decision and subsequent acts of the New Jersey state legislature.

A 2006 study, found that 170 jurisdictions in California had some form of inclusionary housing. This was a 59% increase from 2003, when only 107 jurisdictions had inclusionary housing. In addition, state law requires that 15% of the housing units produced in redevelopment project areas must be affordable. At least 20% of revenue generated from a redevelopment project must be contributed to low-income and moderate-income housing. However, Governor Jerry Brown passed AB 1X 26 that dissolved all redevelopment agencies on February 1, 2012.

However, Los Angeles, California&#x27;s inclusionary zoning ordinance for rental housing was invalidated in 2009 by the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District because it directly conflicted with a provision of the state&#x27;s Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1996 which specifically gave all landlords the right to set the &quot;initial rental rate&quot; for new housing units.

Madison, Wisconsin&#x27;s inclusionary zoning ordinance respecting rental housing was struck down by Wisconsin&#x27;s 4th District Court of Appeals in 2006 because that appellate court construed inclusionary zoning to be rent control, which is prohibited by state statute. The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined the city&#x27;s request to review the case. The ordinance was structured with a sunset in February 2009, unless extended by the Common Council. The Common Council did not extend the inclusionary zoning ordinance and therefore it expired and is no longer in effect.

=== International Examples ===

==== Johannesburg, South Africa ====
On 21 Feb 2019, the City of Johannesburg Council approved its &quot;Inclusionary Housing Incentives, Regulations and Mechanisms 2019&quot;. The policy is the first of its kind in South Africa and provides four options for inclusionary housing (including price limited, size limited or negotiated options) where at least 30% of dwelling units in new developments of 20 units or more, must be inclusionary housing.

== The trend of going mandatory over voluntary ==
While inclusionary zoning can be either mandatory or voluntary, some studies have shown that mandatory approaches would be crucial to the success of inclusionary zoning programs in terms of providing a larger number of affordable housing. Below are some examples showing the greater effect of mandatory practice over voluntary practice:

<text>Marius is a lunar impact crater located on the Oceanus Procellarum. The surface to the west and north of this crater contains a large number of lunar domes spread across an area over a hundred kilometers in diameter that may be of volcanic origin dubbed the Marius Hills. These domes, if volcanic, may have been formed by magma that is fairly more viscous than the volcanic material that formed the basaltic lunar maria. The nearest named crater feature is Reiner to the southwest. Kepler is located to the east-southeast, and rays from that formation reach the rim of Marius.
The floor of Marius has been flooded by basaltic lava, and the surface is relatively smooth and flat. There is no central rise, but a small craterlet Marius G lies in the northeast part of the floor. The crater rim is low and generally circular in form.

The area of this crater was one of the locations proposed for an Apollo mission, but the expedition was subsequently cancelled. About 50 kilometres to the southeast was the landing site of the Luna 7 probe.

One of the numerous rilles in the crater&#x27;s surrounding area has been found to host a probable cave skylight of a lava cave in 2009. Observations by the Japanese probe SELENE indicate the hole is about 90 meters deep, and the roof — the top part of the tube — is about 25 meters thick. This would be a likely location to consider moon colonization should the hole connect to a long enough section of ancient lava tube.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marius.

==Popular culture==
Within the Sega CD RPG &quot;&quot; (and all subsequent ) there is a region called the Marius Zone, which is named after the Marius crater.

<doc id="993536" wikidata="Q1132740" url="?curid=993536" title="Strong programme">
<text>The strong programme or strong sociology is a variety of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) particularly associated with David Bloor, Barry Barnes, Harry Collins, Donald A. MacKenzie, and John Henry. The strong programme&#x27;s influence on science and technology studies is credited as being unparalleled (Latour 1999). The largely Edinburgh-based school of thought aims to illustrate how the existence of a scientific community, bound together by allegiance to a shared paradigm, is a prerequisite for normal scientific activity.

The strong programme is a reaction against &quot;weak&quot; sociologies of science, which restricted the application of sociology to &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;false&quot; theories, such as phrenology. Failed theories would be explained by citing the researchers&#x27; biases, such as covert political or economic interests. Sociology would be only marginally relevant to successful theories, which succeeded because they had revealed a fact of nature. The strong programme proposed that both &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest. All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.

==Characteristics==
As formulated by David Bloor, the strong programme has four indispensable components:
#&quot;Causality&quot;: it examines the conditions (psychological, social, and cultural) that bring about claims to a certain kind of knowledge.
#&quot;Impartiality&quot;: it examines successful as well as unsuccessful knowledge claims.
#&quot;Symmetry&quot;: the same types of explanations are used for successful and unsuccessful knowledge claims alike.
#&quot;Reflexivity&quot;: it must be applicable to sociology itself.

==History==
Because the strong programme originated at the &#x27;Science Studies Unit,&#x27; University of Edinburgh, it is sometimes termed the Edinburgh School. However, there is also a Bath School associated with Harry Collins that makes similar proposals. In contrast to the Edinburgh School, which emphasizes historical approaches, the Bath School emphasizes microsocial studies of laboratories and experiments. The Bath school, however, does depart from the strong programme on some fundamental issues. In the social construction of technology (SCOT) approach developed by Collins&#x27; student Trevor Pinch, as well as by the Dutch sociologist Wiebe Bijker, the strong programme was extended to technology. There are SSK-influenced scholars working in science and technology studies programs throughout the world.

==Criticism==
In order to study scientific knowledge from a sociological point of view, the strong programme has adhered to a form of radical relativism. In other words, it argues that – in the social study of institutionalised beliefs about &quot;truth&quot; – it would be unwise to use &quot;truth&quot; as an explanatory resource. To do so would (according to the relativist view) include the answer as part of the question (Barnes 1992), and propound a &quot;whiggish&quot; approach towards the study of history – a narrative of human history as an inevitable march towards truth and enlightenment. Alan Sokal has criticised radical relativism as part of the science wars, on the basis that such an understanding will lead inevitably towards solipsism and postmodernism. Markus Seidel attacks the main arguments – underdetermination and norm-circularity – provided by Strong Programme proponents for their relativism. It has also been argued that the strong programme has incited climate denial.

<doc id="993540" wikidata="Q5077747" url="?curid=993540" title="Charles Foster Johnson">
<text>Charles Foster Johnson (born April 13, 1953) is an American blogger, software developer, and former jazz guitarist.
He has played on 30 albums, sometimes credited as Icarus Johnson. He started the political blog Little Green Footballs in 2001.

==Biography==
Johnson was born in New York and raised in Hawaii. He launched his first career (as a jazz guitarist) in the mid-1970s. Extensive recording credits include at least three albums that went gold: &quot;Reach For It&quot; by George Duke, &quot;School Days&quot; by Stanley Clarke, and &quot;Live in London&quot; by Al Jarreau. He was a member of Richard Page and Steve George&#x27;s pre-Mr. Mister band, Pages and played on the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;I Do Believe in You.&quot;

He later co-founded CodeHead Technologies,
which marketed productivity and desktop publishing software (mostly written in assembly language) for the Atari ST personal computer. 
In 2001, Johnson founded a web design firm called &quot;Little Green Footballs&quot; with his brother Michael. Little Green Footballs began as a testbed on the company&#x27;s website.

Johnson was raised Roman Catholic but now considers himself an agnostic.

Johnson is a co-founder of Pajamas Media, selling his stake in 2007.

==Killian memos==

Johnson, and other bloggers, gained attention during the 2004 U.S. presidential election for their role in questioning the authenticity of several memos purporting to document irregularities in George W. Bush&#x27;s National Guard service record. (See Killian documents and Killian documents authenticity issues.) CBS news anchor Dan Rather presented the memos as authentic in a September 8, 2004 report on &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, two months before the vote. Days after the broadcast, Johnson alleged the documents, supposedly typewritten in 1973, could have been created easily on a modern computer using Microsoft Word.

<text>The Popular Unity Party was a political party in Iraq led by Youssif Hamdan. It was founded in 1995 and was initially known as the Communist Party of Iraq (CPI). The CPI split away from the Iraqi Communist Party during the latter period of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. Many saw the CPI as a puppet party of the regime, whose existence would give the outside world an impression that the country was a multi-party state. The party met with foreign delegations visiting Iraq. It seemed the intentions of the party would&#x27;ve been to join the government as a junior partner within the National Progressive Front, similar to the coalition of the same name set-up in neighbouring Syria, but the idea was later discarded. The CPI was never given possibility to register as a legal party, though its leader was in the Iraqi parliament as of 2001.

Following the fall of the Saddam&#x27;s regime in 2003, the party was reconstructed as the Popular Unity Party.

<doc id="993546" wikidata="Q170566" url="?curid=993546" title="Japan national football team">
<text>The , also known by the nickname , represents Japan in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the Japan Football Association (JFA), the governing body for football in Japan.

Until the end of the 1980s, Japan was a small and amateur team. For a long time, football was less popular than baseball and sumo. Since the early 1990s, when Japanese football became fully professionalized, Japan has emerged as one of the most successful teams in Asia; they have qualified for every FIFA World Cup since 1998 (including an automatic berth in 2002 as co-hosts with South Korea) with knockout stage appearances that year, and in 2010, 2018 and 2022. They have won the Asian Cup a record four times, in 1992, 2000, 2004 and 2011. The team also finished runners-up in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2019 Asian Cup. Japan is one of three teams from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to have reached the final of a senior FIFA men&#x27;s competition, the others being Australia and Saudi Arabia.

Japan&#x27;s progression in a short period has served as an inspiration and example of how to develop football. Their principal continental rivals are South Korea and, most recently, Australia; they also developed rivalries against Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Japan was the first team from outside the Americas to participate in the Copa América, having been invited in the 1999, 2011, 2015, and 2019 editions of the tournament, although they only played in the 1999 and 2019 events.

As of October 2024, Japan is the highest-ranked AFC team at 15th, and has been since December 2022.

==History==
===1910s–1930s: Pre-war era===

Japan&#x27;s earliest international matches were at the 1917 Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo, where it was represented by a team from the Tokyo Higher Normal School. Although Japan made strong showings in swimming, baseball, and track and field, its football team suffered resounding defeats to the Republic of China and the Philippines. Nevertheless, the game was promoted in Japanese schools in the 1920s. The Japan Football Association was formed in 1921, and Japan joined FIFA in May 1929. However, Japan refused to participate in the 1930 FIFA World Cup.

Japan&#x27;s first &quot;true&quot; national team (as opposed to a university team chosen to represent the country) was fielded at the 1930 Far Eastern Championship Games, and drew with China for the championship title. Shigeyoshi Suzuki coached the national team to its first Olympic appearance at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Japan was an entrant for 1938 World Cup qualifying, but withdrew before its scheduled qualifying match against the Dutch East Indies.

After World War II began, Japan did not play in international competition, except for a handful of matches against Manchuria and other colonies. Its last prewar match for purposes of Elo ratings was a friendly against the Philippines in June 1940. While Korea was under Japanese rule, multiple Koreans played in international competition for Japan, including Kim Yong-sik (1936–40), Kim Sung-gan (1940) and Lee Yoo-hyung (1940).

===1950s–1980s: Post-war era===

Japan&#x27;s postwar debut was in the 1951 Asian Games in India. Japan re-joined FIFA in 1950 and played in qualifiers for the 1954 World Cup, but lost the AFC qualifying berth to South Korea after two matches. Japan also joined the Asian Football Confederation in 1954.

Dettmar Cramer joined the Japan national team as coach in 1960, and helped lead the team to the round of eight at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Japan&#x27;s first major achievement in international football came in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where the team won the bronze medal. Although this result earned the sport increased recognition in Japan, the absence of a professional domestic league hindered its growth and Japan would not qualify for the World Cup until 30 years later. Nonetheless, Japan were close to qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, but lost to South Korea in the deciding matches.

Japan made its first appearance in the Asian Cup in 1988, where they were eliminated in the group stage following a draw with Iran and losses to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

The late 1980s saw concrete moves to professionalize the sport in Japan. JFA introduced a Special Licensed Player system in 1986, allowing a limited number of professional players to compete in the domestic semi-professional league. Action committees were held in 1988 and 1989 to discuss the introduction of a full professional league in Japan.

===1990s: Rise===

In the 1990s, the Japan Football Association began the professionalization of its national football team. In 1991, the owners of the semi-professional Japan Soccer League agreed to disband the league and re-form as the professional J.League, partly to raise the sport&#x27;s profile and to strengthen the national team program. The following year, Japan hosted the 1992 Asian Cup and won their first title by defeating Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the final. The J.League was officially launched in 1993.

However, in its first attempt to qualify with professional players, Japan narrowly missed a ticket to the 1994 World Cup after drawing with Iraq in the final match of the qualification round, remembered by fans as the &quot;Agony of Doha&quot;. Japan&#x27;s next tournament was a defence of their continental title at the 1996 Asian Cup. The team won all their games in the group stage but were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 2–0 loss to Kuwait.

The nation&#x27;s first ever World Cup appearance was in 1998, where Japan lost all their games. The first two fixtures went 1–0 in favour of Argentina and Croatia, and the campaign ended with a 2–1 defeat to Jamaica. Japan impressed, however, as all three defeats were only by a one goal margin.

===2000s: Two Asian Cup titles, World Cup co-hosts===
In the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, Japan managed to reclaim their title after defeating Saudi Arabia in the final, becoming Asian champions for the second time.
Two years later, Japan co-hosted the 2002 World Cup with South Korea. After a 2–2 draw with Belgium in their opening match, the Japanese team advanced to the second round with a 1–0 win over Russia and a 2–0 victory against Tunisia. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the round of 16, after losing 1–0 to eventual third-place finishers Turkey in extra time.

With the 2004 Asian Cup hosted by China, the Japanese managed to retain the title by winning their group after two victories over Thailand and Oman, before achieving victories against Jordan and Bahrain. They defeated the hosts in the final 3–1.
On 8 June 2005, Japan qualified for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, its third consecutive World Cup, by beating North Korea 2–0 on neutral ground. However, Japan failed to advance to the round of 16, losing to future AFC rival Australia 3–1, drawing Croatia 0–0 and falling to Brazil 4–1.

The 2007 AFC Asian Cup saw Japan fail to defend its title. Although easily winning the group over Vietnam, Qatar and the UAE, the Japanese were totally exhausted in their game against Australia, where Japan won only by a penalty shootout. Japan lost to Saudi Arabia in the semi-finals, before failing in the third-place match against South Korea.

===2010s===

During the 2010 World Cup qualification, in the fourth round of the Asian qualifiers, Japan became the first team other than the host South Africa to qualify after defeating Uzbekistan 1–0 away. Japan was drawn in Group E along with the Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon. Japan started with a 1–0 win against Cameroon, before subsequently losing to the Netherlands 1–0. Then, Japan resoundingly beat Denmark 3–1 to advance to the next round against Paraguay. In the round of 16, Japan were eliminated from the competition following penalties after a 0–0 draw against Paraguay.

After the World Cup, head coach Takeshi Okada resigned. He was replaced by former Juventus and Milan coach Alberto Zaccheroni. In his first few matches, Japan recorded victories over Guatemala (2–1) and Paraguay (1–0), as well as a 1–0 victory over Argentina.

Japan participated in the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar. On 29 January, they beat Australia 1–0 in the final after extra time, their fourth Asian Cup triumph and allowing them to qualify for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. The country then started their road to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Throughout, they suffered only two losses to Uzbekistan and Jordan, and drew against Australia. After a 1–1 draw with Australia, they qualified for the 2014 World Cup, becoming the first nation aside from the hosts to qualify.

Japan started their 2013 Confederations Cup campaign with a 3–0 loss to Brazil. They were then eliminated from the competition after losing to Italy 4–3. They lost their final match 1–2 against Mexico and finished in fourth place in Group A. One month later, in the EAFF East Asian Cup, they started out with a 3–3 draw to China. They then beat Australia 3–2 and beat South Korea 2–1 in the third and final match in the tournament to claim the title.

Japan was placed into Group C at the 2014 World Cup alongside the Ivory Coast, Greece and Colombia. They fell in their first match to Ivory Coast 2–1 after initially taking the lead, allowing two goals in a two-minute span. They drew their second game to Greece 0–0. To qualify for the second round, they needed a victory against Colombia and Greece to win against Ivory Coast. Greece beat Ivory Coast 2–1, but Colombia won 4–1, eliminating Japan from the World Cup. Alberto Zaccheroni resigned as head coach. In July 2014, former Mexico and Espanyol manager Javier Aguirre took over, and Japan lost 0–2 to Uruguay in the first game he managed.

Japan won its opening match at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Group D against Asian Cup debutantes Palestine 4–0, with goals from Yasuhito Endō, Shinji Okazaki, Keisuke Honda and Maya Yoshida. Okazaki was named man of the match. They then faced Iraq and Jordan in their next group matches, which they won 1–0 and 2–0 respectively. They qualified to the knockout stage as Group D winners with nine points, seven goals scored and no goals conceded. In the quarter-finals, Japan lost to the UAE in a penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw, as Honda and Shinji Kagawa missed their penalty kicks. Japan&#x27;s elimination marked their worst performance in the tournament in 19 years.

After the Asian Cup, Aguirre was sacked following allegations of corruption during a prior tenure. He was replaced by Vahid Halilhodžić in March 2015. Japan started on a rough note during qualification, losing to the UAE 1–2 at home. They then picked up the pace in their other qualifier games against Iraq, Australia, and Thailand, picking up five wins and two draws. On 31 August 2017, Japan defeated Australia 2–0 at home, thus qualifying them for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, making it their sixth successive World Cup. However, the Japan Football Association decided to sack Halilhodžić on 9 April 2018, only ten weeks before the World Cup, citing reasons of a breakdown in relationship between the coach and players, and poor recent friendly results, and appoint the Technical Director, Japanese coach Akira Nishino as the new manager.
Japan made history in the 2018 World Cup by defeating Colombia 2–1, their first ever victory by any AFC team against a CONMEBOL team in an official tournament, as well as Japan&#x27;s first ever victory at the World Cup finals in UEFA nations. Their second match against Senegal ended in a draw with goals from Takashi Inui and Keisuke Honda. Japan were defeated in their last group game in the Group H against Poland 1–0, leaving Japan and Senegal tied for second with an identical record; however, as Japan had received two fewer yellow cards, Japan advanced to the knockout stage on the Fair Play Points tiebreaker, the first team to do so. The match with Poland caused controversy, as Japan were made aware of their advantage over Senegal with ten minutes left and decided to play an extremely conservative game with no attempts to take a shot on goal, despite losing 1–0, with some fans booing the players. The match received comparison to the 1982 World Cup Disgrace of Gijón, in which a similar game was played. Japan were the only AFC team to have qualified to the knockout stage. 

In the round of 16 against Belgium, Japan took a 2–0 lead with a goal in the 48th minute by Genki Haraguchi and another in the 52nd by Takashi Inui, but yielded three goals afterwards, including the winner by Nacer Chadli on the counterattack in the 94th minute. The defeat to Belgium was the first time a nation had lost a knockout match at the World Cup after taking a two-goal advantage since England lost to West Germany 3–2 in extra-time in the quarter-final of the 1970 edition. Despite losing a 2–0 lead, Japan&#x27;s impressive performance was praised by fans, pundits and the media.

Japan participated in the 2019 Asian Cup, finishing on top of group F after defeating Turkmenistan 3–2, Oman 1–0 and Uzbekistan 2–1. Japan defeated Saudi Arabia in the round of sixteen and dark horse Vietnam in the quarter-finals by a 1–0 margin. After defeating Iran 3–0 to reach the final, Japan&#x27;s hope to win their fifth Asian Cup was lost with the team suffering a 3–1 defeat to Qatar, who won the Asian Cup for the first time.

Japan were invited to the 2019 Copa America, their second appearance at the tournament, and brought a young squad to the competition. They were placed in Group C with Uruguay, Chile and Ecuador. The nation lost their opening match 4–0 to Chile, before bouncing back and drawing against Uruguay 2–2. Japan needed a win against Ecuador to qualify for the knockouts, however they drew 1–1 and missed out due to inferior goal difference to Paraguay. Aftermath saw Japan played a friendly game against the Paraguayans, and won 2–0 at home.

===2020s===
After China was removed as host of the 2022 EAFF E-1 Football Championship, it was announced that Japan was the new host. After topping the table with two wins and one draw, Japan won the competition for the second time in their history.

Japan qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and were drawn into Group E with Germany, Costa Rica and Spain. On 23 November, Japan produced an upset, beating Germany 2–1, with two goals in an eight-minute span during the second half. After losing to Costa Rica 1–0, going into the final matchday, every team in Group E could qualify or be eliminated, with no team assured of any placement. In the end, Japan managed to qualify for the round of 16 by defeating Spain 2–1 in their final group stage match, while also contributing to Germany&#x27;s elimination from the tournament. By topping their group, Japan went on to face Croatia in the round of 16 where they would lose 3–1 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. It was the third team in 52 years to have come from behind twice in one tournament, following Brazil and (West) Germany. They beat Spain with the lowest possession (18%) of the ball ever for a winning side since the 1966 World Cup. It also was the first time that an Asian team topped their World Cup group held outside their home country, and also the first Asian team to reach the knockouts twice in a row.

Japan were considered the favourites for the 2023 Asian Cup in Qatar, but disappointed; Hajime Moriyasu&#x27;s men began the tournament with an unconvincing victory over a Vietnamese side deprived of a number of key players (4–2), before going on to play a nightmarish game against Iraq (a 2–1 loss). This defeat, Japan&#x27;s first in the group stage since their first appearance in 1988, condemned them to finish second in the group due to their unfavourable head-to-head record. The Japanese sealed three points after overcoming Indonesia 3–1 and then eliminated Bahrain by the same scoreline in the round of 16. Japan met Iran in the quarter-finals for a rematch of the previous edition&#x27;s semi-final, and got the game off to a perfect start with Hidemasa Morita&#x27;s 28th-minute opener, before falling completely flat in the second half, succumbing to Iran&#x27;s fiery attacks, 2–1. The country suffered two defeats at the Asian Cup for the first time since their debut in 1988, while conceding at least one goal in every match. The squad also had to contend with an extra controversy, with the sudden departure of Junya Itō shortly before the match against Iran, due to the Stade de Reims player having been accused of sexual assault.

===Nicknames===
Japan&#x27;s national football team is nicknamed the by the JFA. The team also is often known by the last name of the manager. For example, under Takeshi Okada, the team was known as , or during the 2022 World Cup, the team is referred by the current manager&#x27;s (Hajime Moriyasu) name, as .

===Kits===
The national team kit design has gone through several alterations in the past. In the early 1980s, the kit was white with blue trim. The kits worn for the 1992 Asian Cup consisted of white stripes (stylized to form a wing) with red diamonds. During the 1996 Asian Cup and the 1998 World Cup, the national team kits were blue jerseys with red and white flame designs on the sleeves, and were designed by JFA (with the sponsor alternating each year between Asics, Puma, and Adidas). The 1996 design was reproduced in a special kit used against Syria on 7 June 2017.

Japan uses blue and white rather than red and white due to a superstition. Japan first used blue shirts in the 1930 Far Eastern Championship Games, where a team of the Tokyo Imperial University (whose color is light blue) represented Japan wearing light blue shirts, and then in a match against Sweden in the 1936 Summer Olympics. Between 1988 and 1992, the kits were red and white, matching the colours of Japan&#x27;s national flag. After failing to qualify for the 1990 World Cup and 1992 Summer Olympics, the red shirt was scrapped.

In the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2015 Asian Cup, Japan temporarily switched the colour of the numbers from white to gold.

Japan&#x27;s kit is provided by German company Adidas, the team&#x27;s exclusive kit supplier since April 1999. Before that, Asics and Puma had been the team&#x27;s official apparel sponsor.

On 3 June 2021, Japan released the special 100th anniversary kit for a friendly match against Jamaica, but the match was cancelled and replaced with a match against the U-24 team. The kit was also used by the U-24 team against U-24 Ghana on 5 June 2021.

===Crest===
The crest or emblem of the national team was adopted in late 2017 as part of a larger rebranding by the Japan Football Association. The crest features the Yatagarasu, a three-legged crow from Japanese mythology that is a symbol for the sun, holding a solid red ball that is like the sun from national flag. The text &quot;JFA&quot; (for the Japan Football Association) is inscribed at the bottom of the crow. A red stripe is also present at the center of the shield behind the crow. The shield has a metallic gold trim and has a thicker black outline. The name of the country represented by the national team &quot;Japan&quot; is also inscribed within the black border.

The previous crest used from 1996 had a shield with a more complex shape. The ball held by the Yatagarasu had white details. The text &quot;Japan&quot; is absent and &quot;JFA&quot; is written in a different typeface.

Before 1988, Japan used the national flag outlined in red (and with JFA written in black on the lower left corner of the flag) on the shirts.

The Yatagarasu was first seen on the Japan shirts in 1988, where it was on a yellow circle with a blue outline with &quot;JAPAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION&quot; written around it. In 1991, the emblem changed to a white shield with a red vertical stripe on the center with the crow on it and &quot;JFA&quot; written in a green Gothic typeface. This crest was used until 1996.

===Home stadium===
Japan plays its home matches among various stadiums, in rotation, around the country, especially the Saitama Stadium 2002.

===Rivalries===
====South Korea====
Japan maintains a strong football rivalry with South Korea. Japan have met South Korea 80 times, trailing the statistic at 16 wins, 23 draws, and 42 losses, while scoring 73 goals and conceding 124. Since November 1991, when the Japan Professional Football League was launched, the record is almost even with 9 wins, 12 draws and 10 losses. Both countries have made themselves unrivalled in both Asian Cup and World Cup records, being two of the most successful Asian football teams, and they hosted the 2002 World Cup in a joint bid.

==== North Korea ====
Japan maintains a rivalry with North Korea, although the rivalry is infrequent due to political circumstances. Japan have met North Korea 22 times, with a record of 10 wins, 4 draws and 8 losses.

==== China ====

Previously, when Japan had not established professional football, Japan had only 4 wins, 3 draws and 13 losses against China. However, Japan&#x27;s establishment of professional football helped turn the tide, and the Japanese have been able to exert domination with 15 wins, 6 draws and just 2 losses. China has not beaten Japan since March 1998, and lost to them 3–1 in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup final.

====Australia====

Japan began to develop a fierce rivalry with fellow Asian powerhouse Australia, shortly after the latter joined the Asian Football Confederation. The rivalry is regarded as one of Asia&#x27;s biggest football rivalries. The rivalry is a relatively recent one, born from a number of highly competitive matches between the two teams since Australia joined the AFC in 2006. The rivalry began at the 2006 World Cup where the two countries were grouped together, and continued with the two countries meeting regularly in various AFC competitions, such as the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, the 2011 AFC Asian Cup Final and the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup.

Japan have met Australia 27 times, with a record of 12 wins, 9 draws and 6 losses.

==== Saudi Arabia ====

Japan and Saudi Arabia are two of the most historically successful national teams in Asia and have frequently met each other in many major tournaments, including in the Asian Cup and World Cup qualification. The frequency is also rivalled by high-level performances of Japan and Saudi Arabia in the Asian and global football stage, as they are two of the three AFC members (alongside Australia) to reach the final of any senior FIFA competition. Both countries also gained headlines for producing &quot;unexpected&quot; wins in the 2022 World Cup, with Japan earning wins against Germany and Spain and Saudi Arabia against eventual champions Argentina in the group stage. These wins over World Cup-winning oppositions have allowed comparisons of developments between Japan and Saudi Arabia to emerge.

In the head-to-head record, Japan have an advantage over the Saudis with 12 wins, 1 draw and 6 losses.

====Iran==== 

Japan and Iran have a combined seven Asian Cup titles, with a rivalry developing in the 1990s due to the famous that gave Japan a ticket to their first World Cup defeating the Persians by 3–2 in a neutral Asian play-off hosted in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. 

More recently, the two countries met in the 2019 and 2023 Asian Cups. The Samurai Blue defeated Team Melli 3–0 in the semifinals of the 2019 edition. The Iranians got revenge four years later eliminating Japan 2–1 in the quarter-finals.

Japan have met Iran 19 times, with a record of 6 wins, 6 draws and 7 losses.

===Supporters===

Japanese national team supporters are known for chanting &quot;Nippon Ole&quot; (Nippon is the Japanese word for Japan) at home matches.

===Sponsorship===
Japan has one of the highest sponsorship incomes for a national squad. In 2006 their sponsorship income amounted to over 16.5 million pounds.

Primary sponsors include Adidas, ANA, Kirin, Saison Card International, FamilyMart, JAL, MS&amp;AD Insurance Group, Asahi Shinbun, Mizuho Financial, Daito Trust Construction and KDDI.

===Mascot===
The mascots are &quot;Karappe&quot; () and &quot;Karara&quot; (), two Yatagarasu wearing the Japan national football team kit. The mascots were designed by Japanese manga artist Susumu Matsushita. Each year when a new kit is launched, the mascots&#x27; uniforms are updated in order to match the kit being used by the team.

For the 2014 World Cup, the Pokémon character Pikachu served as the mascot.

===Copa América===

Japan was the first team from outside the Americas to participate in the Copa América, having been invited to the 1999 tournament. Japan was also invited in 2011 and initially accepted the invitation. However, following the Tōhoku earthquake, the JFA later withdrew on 16 May 2011, citing the difficulty of releasing some Japanese players from European teams to play as replacements. On the next day, CONMEBOL invited Costa Rica to replace Japan in the competition.

On 16 August 2013, CONMEBOL president Eugenio Figueredo announced that Japan was invited to the 2015 Copa América. However, Japan later declined the invitation due to scheduling problems.

On 14 May 2018, CONMEBOL announced that Japan, alongside Qatar, would be the two invited teams for the 2019 Copa América.

<text>Treehouse TV (commonly known as Treehouse) is a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel that was launched in 1997. Its name comes from sister network YTV&#x27;s former programming block, &quot;The Treehouse&quot;. The channel is owned by YTV Canada, Inc., a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment. Having launched on November 1, 1997, it is the first full-day preschool-oriented TV channel in Canada.

Development of a separate channel started when YTV aired preschool shows as part of its weekday morning line-up. This block of shows was given the name &quot;The Treehouse&quot; in 1994. On November 1, 1997, Treehouse TV launched as its own channel, airing from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. daily. The channel, as of 2003, is currently a 24-hour broadcaster.

Like the block it was spun off from, commercials weren&#x27;t broadcast when the Treehouse channel first launched. Instead, shorts hosted by humans and puppets were broadcast. As of 2011, Treehouse TV had been available to over 7.5 million homes across Canada.

==History==
===The Treehouse block===

The Treehouse brand began as a daily programming block for children on YTV. The block was given the name &quot;The Treehouse&quot; in 1994. Commercials for the block weren&#x27;t shown. Instead, the block was hosted by three program jockeys (or &quot;PJs&quot;) named PJ Katie, PJ Krista, and PJ Todd. In between shows, the PJs made crafts, played games, and held contests. As the block&#x27;s name suggests, these segments were set in a tree house.

The PJs&#x27; co-hosts were a group of stuffed animal puppets called the Fuzzpaws. On Fridays, PJ Katie would act out stories with clay animals. These segments were eventually spun off into the series &quot;PJ Katie&#x27;s Farm&quot;.

===Treehouse channel===

In early 1996, it was announced that YTV was looking to &quot;break part of [its] audience off with a separate network aimed at viewers under the age of 6.&quot; The network&#x27;s president, Patricia Macdonald, said she had &quot;done a lot of research that led us to the conclusion that the kids market is underserved.&quot; On September 4, 1996, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved YTV&#x27;s request to launch a new channel called Treehouse TV.

The new channel eventually debuted on Saturday, November 1, 1997, at 8:00 a.m. EST. For a few months, The Treehouse block on YTV continued to air alongside the channel. In 1998, the Treehouse block was replaced by YTV Jr., an unhosted block.

Like the Treehouse block, the Treehouse channel was non-commercial, opting instead to show interstitial shorts in between shows. These shorts featured a new set of characters who lived in Treetown. Despite the PJs (program jockeys) from the original Treehouse block not returning for the Treehouse channel, &quot;PJ Katie&#x27;s Farm&quot; reran on Treehouse throughout 1999.

In March 2005, Corus Entertainment began offering a video on demand service called &quot;Treehouse On Demand&quot; to cable providers such as Rogers Cable and Cogeco, delivering content from Treehouse TV. It is offered as a free service to customers who subscribe to each providers digital cable service. Some providers such as SaskTel offer it as a standalone premium subscription service. Between June 2015 and May 2019, Corus operated &quot;TreehouseGO&quot;, a TV Everywhere service available on iOS and Android devices.

In 2011, Corus launched a standalone subscription video on demand service for iOS. It was later rebranded to &quot;Treehouse Classic&quot; before a 2016 revamp dropped the &quot;Classic&quot; branding.

On February 5, 2013, Nelvana, Corus Entertainment&#x27;s animation division, launched the Treehouse Direct channel on YouTube. On March 2, 2015, Treehouse TV launched its own YouTube channel.

On July 19, 2019, Corus Entertainment filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against a medical marijuana dispensary chain, known as &quot;Treehouse Dispensary&quot;, alleging the chain &quot;wilfully copied and is using a confusing similar imitation&quot; of the Treehouse TV logo. An attorney for the dispensary contested the claims and said that the business &quot;categorically denies that its logo infringes on any existing trademarks in the United States.&quot; Corus won the lawsuit through a default judgment the following December.

On July 4, 2022, the CRTC announced plans for The Channel along with Boomerang, Adult Swim, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Télétoon, YTV, Disney Channel, La Chaîne Disney, Disney Junior, and Disney XD have been renewed for another two years (licenses not valid as of August 31, 2024).

<doc id="993560" wikidata="Q5683614" url="?curid=993560" title="Havelok the Dane">
<text>Havelok the Dane, also known as Havelok or Lay of Havelok the Dane, is a 13th-century Middle English romance considered to be part of the Matter of England. The story, however, is also known in two earlier Anglo-Norman versions, one by Geffrei Gaimar and another known as the Lai d&#x27;havelok. The name &quot;Havelok&quot; also has many variations in spelling, and can be found as &quot;Haveloc&quot;, &quot;Havelock&quot;, or &quot;Aybloc&quot;.

==Development of the story==

The story of &quot;Havelok&quot; is first told in lines 37–818 of Geoffrey Gaimar&#x27;s Anglo-Norman &quot;Estoire des Engleis&quot; of about 1135–40.

This was the basis for a few other Anglo-Norman poems, the &quot;Lai d&#x27;havelok&quot;, which in turn may have influenced &quot;Havelok the Dane&quot;. &quot;Havelok&quot; is the second oldest surviving romance written in English, after King Horn; it is believed to have been composed somewhere between 1285 and 1310. The romance survives in one imperfect version in the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, as well as some fragments. A copy of the 3,001 line poem is available to view in Grimsby Public Library. A new publication of the late 19th-century translation by Walter Skeat is available as &quot;The Lay of Havelock the Dane&quot;.

&quot;Havelok&quot; is often categorized as belonging to the so-called Matter of England, because it deals with legends of English history rather than the legends of Rome, France and Britain, the three traditional subjects of medieval romance. The poem is notable for its interest in law and legal practice and its exploration of ideal kingship, as well as for its detailed depiction of working-class life in 13th-century Lincolnshire. It has been called a &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; romance because of the high value placed on hard work, virtuous behaviour, and proverbial wisdom, but since this value is just as observable in working-class life the term can be misleading.

There is evidence that the legend of Havelok was a popular one, as the town of Grimsby, which features in the story, depicted three of its characters – Havelok, Goldeboru, and Grim – on its town seal in the early thirteenth century. The story unites the local interest of the founding of Grimsby in Lincolnshire to an interest in the complex national identity of England in the Middle Ages, bringing together early English, Norman, Danish and British influences.

Even today, the town seal of Grimsby still names Grim, Havelok, and Goldborow. It is possible to visit the &quot;Grim-stone&quot; and the &quot;Havelok-stone&quot; at Grimsby and Lincoln, respectively. A statue of Grim and Havelok stood outside the main site of Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education from 1973 until 2006, but was removed on health and safety grounds after Havelock was decapitated by vandals. 

The character Havelok may be based upon the historical Amlaíb Cuarán, a 10th-century Norse-Gaelic ruler, and the legend&#x27;s plot loosely based upon Amlaíb&#x27;s life, though there is no critical consensus. Skeat posited a possible link to early legends of Amleth.

==Plot summary==
===According to Gaimar===
This plot summary is based on the translation of Hardy and Martin.

King Adelbrit is a Dane ruling Norfolk under Constantine, King Arthur&#x27;s nephew, along with a part of Denmark (71-74). King Edelsie is a Briton and King of Lincoln and Lindsey. His sister Orwain marries Adelbrit, and their child is Argentille. Orwain and Adelbrit die at much the same time (lines 1-94). When Adelbrit dies, Edelsie marries his niece to a serving lad called Cuheran in order to clear the way for taking over Adelbrit&#x27;s kingdom himself (93-104, 165–80).

Cuheran is handsome, magnanimous and the freemen and nobles of the household would have given him anything he wanted if only he weren&#x27;t so humble that he asks for nothing (95-154). In something of a blind motif which does, however, serve to suggest Cuheran&#x27;s boorishness, it takes a few nights for Cuheran to get round to having sex with Argentille (177-94). Argentille has a prophetic dream (195-240). Argentille awakes to find Cuheran sleeping on his back, with a flame burning at his mouth. She wakes Cuheran and he explains the dream as a prophecy of the feast he will be cooking the next day and adds that he doesn&#x27;t know why a flame burns at his mouth when he sleeps (241-310). Argentille decides she would rather live with Cuheran&#x27;s family than in shame with her uncle (301-28). Cuheran believes he has two brothers (who are in fact not his brothers, 155–60) and a sister Kelloc, and that they are all the sons of a fisherman and salt-seller called Grim (330-34) and his wife Sebrug (369-70). Kelloc and her husband Alger, a fisherman (331) and a merchant (455-62, 481–84), resolve to tell Cuheran that he is actually called Havelock and is the son of King Gunter of Denmark and Queen Alvive, daughter of King Gaifer. Kelloc and her brothers are in fact the children of Alvive by one of her retainers, Grim. Gunter was killed by King Arthur; Alvive fled with Grim, their children, and Havelock/Cuheran, but was herself killed by pirates on the way (426-40, 582–85). Kelloc&#x27;s husband trades with Denmark and reckons that the people would be happy if Havelock came to claim his inheritance (334-468). Havelock and Argentille sail to Denmark with the merchants (469-504).

Denmark is ruled by the evil King Odulf/Edulf, brother of King Aschis, one of Arthur&#x27;s knights (510-28). On arrival, Havelock is attacked and Argentille seized. Havelock defeats the attackers and rescues Argentille, but the two are forced to flee to a church tower where they defend themselves (533-54). Fortunately, Sigar Estalre, Gunter&#x27;s one-time steward, sees Havelock&#x27;s resemblance to Gunter and rescues him from his predicament (505-9, 555–70). Sigar hears Havelock&#x27;s story and checks its veracity. First, by looking for the flame when he sleeps (571-645), and then by getting Havelock to sound a horn which only the rightful heir of Denmark can sound, whereupon everyone takes Havelock as their lord (646-734). Havelock defeats Edulf in battle (735-758) and then Edelsie, having used the tactic taught to him by Argentille of propping up the corpses of his army to make it look like he has more men. Edelsie dies a few days later, allowing Havelock and Argentille to inherit both Edelsie&#x27;s and Adelbrit&#x27;s old lands. Havelock rules for twenty years (735-818).

===The Middle English romance===
&quot;Havelok&quot; is intricately constructed, consisting of a double arc in which the royal heirs of both Denmark and England are unjustly displaced as children but later restored to their rightful positions. The poem opens in England during the reign of Athelwold, who is described in ideal terms as a just and virtuous king. He dies without an adult successor and leaves his young daughter Goldborow to the care of Godrich, Earl of Cornwall, who is to rule as regent until Goldborow can be married. Athelwold stipulates that she should be married to the &quot;highest man in England&quot;. After Athelwold&#x27;s death Godrich immediately betrays his oath and imprisons Goldborow in a remote tower in Dover.
The poem then shifts to Denmark, where a similarly virtuous king, Birkabein, dies, leaving behind two daughters, Swanborow and Helfled, and a son, Havelok. Godard, a wealthy retainer, is appointed regent. Godard too betrays his trust: he brutally murders the daughters by cutting their throats and hands the three-year-old Havelok over to a thrall, the fisherman Grim, to be drowned in the sea. Grim recognizes Havelok as the rightful heir to the kingdom when he sees a pair of miraculous signs: a bright light that emerges from the boy&#x27;s mouth when he is sleeping, and the “kynemerk,” a cross-shaped birthmark on his shoulder. Grim is persuaded to spare Havelok&#x27;s life, but tells Godard that he has killed the child. Grim flees with Havelok and his family to England, where he founds the town of Grimsby at the estuary of the Humber. Havelok is brought up as part of Grim&#x27;s family and works as a fisherman alongside Grim and his sons. (Several versions tell that Havelok was raised under a false name, Cuaran, in order to protect his identity, though the Middle English version omits this detail.)

Havelok grows to an extraordinary size and strength, and has a huge appetite; during a time of famine, Grim is unable to feed him, and Havelok leaves home to seek his subsistence in Lincoln, barefoot and clad in a cloak made from an old sail. In Lincoln he is taken in by Bertram, a cook in a noble household, and works for him as a kitchen-boy. Havelok&#x27;s humility, gentleness and cheerful nature make him universally popular, especially with children, and his unusual height, strength and beauty draw attention wherever he goes. During a festival, Havelok takes part in a stone-throwing competition and far surpasses the efforts of the other young men with his near-superhuman strength. This victory makes him the subject of discussion and brings him to the notice of Godrich, who is present in Lincoln for a parliament. Godrich notices Havelok&#x27;s unusual height and decides to arrange a marriage between him and Goldburow, as this will fulfil the literal terms of his promise to Athelwold that Goldboruw should marry the &#x27;highest&#x27; man in the kingdom; believing Havelok to be a peasant&#x27;s son, he intends to deprive Goldboruw of her inheritance by the marriage. Havelok is reluctant to marry because he is too poor to support a wife, but he submits to the union after being threatened by Godrich. Havelok and Goldborow marry and return to Grimsby, where they are taken in by Grim&#x27;s children. That night Goldborow is awakened by a bright light and sees the flame coming out of Havelok&#x27;s mouth. She then notices his birthmark, and an angel tells her of Havelok&#x27;s royal lineage and his destiny as king of Denmark and England. At the same time, Havelok has a dream in which he embraces the land and people of Denmark in his arms and presents the kingdom at Goldboruw&#x27;s feet. When he wakes, they share their visions and agree to return to Denmark.

Havelok sails to Denmark with Goldborow and Grim&#x27;s three eldest sons in order to reclaim his kingdom. Disguised as a merchant, Havelok is sheltered by Ubbe, a Danish nobleman. Ubbe is impressed by Havelok&#x27;s strength in an attack on the house, and at night notices the light coming out of Havelok&#x27;s mouth; he recognises Havelok as the son of Birkabein and immediately pledges his support to Havelok in overthrowing Godard. When Havelok has received the submission of many of the Danish lords amid great rejoicing, he defeats Godard and the usurper is condemned to be flayed and hanged. Havelok invades England, overthrows Godrich in battle and claims the throne in Goldborow&#x27;s name. As king of Denmark and England, Havelok rules justly for more than sixty years. He and Goldborow enjoy a happy, loving marriage, and have fifteen children: all their sons become kings and all their daughters queens.

<text>Lyle Douglas Basham Jr. (born May 12, 1971) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenures in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) between 2002 and 2007, and in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Basham in 2007.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1993–1996)===

Basham made his debut in 1993, wrestling in Indiana and for independent promotions in Kentucky. In 1994 he wrestled for the United States Wrestling Association located in Tennessee. He stayed there until 1996.

===Ohio Valley Wrestling (1996–2003, 2005, 2007)===

Before being called up to WWE&#x27;s main roster Basham competed in its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling. Basham is the nephew of OVW founder Nightmare Danny Davis. Basham was a top fan favorite in the company winning the OVW Heavyweight Championship on a number of occasions.

Basham turned villainous and was involved in a unique storyline that saw him compete under a mask as Machine (A character inspired by the film 8mm). The story was that Basham and his real-life uncle and trainer Danny Davis had a falling out which led to Basham quitting the wrestling business. However, as his uncle&#x27;s other OVW-trained superstars like Nick Dinsmore, Rob Conway and Damaja began getting opportunities to wrestle on WWE television and become contracted talents, Basham grew resentful and resurfaced as the masked Machine to spoil the opportunities for the other men Davis had trained. Dinsmore would go on to defeat The Machine in a Retirement versus Mask match at the Last Dance on June 27, 2001, and unmask Machine as Doug Basham.

Basham went on to create the Revolution faction and feuded with OVW&#x27;s top stars. Basham signed a WWE development contract in April 2002 and was soon signed to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in May 2003. In OVW Doug took credit for The Basham Brothers gimmick as his way of getting back at Danny a.k.a. Damaja. The two took part in an epic final encounter which saw Revolution members (including Johnny Spade, Mark Magnus, and Rob Conway) handcuffed to Damaja&#x27;s allies (including Nick Dinsmore and Johnny Jeter) with Matt Morgan on the entrance ramp to prevent any more run-ins. Damaja was victorious leading to Doug being forced out of OVW. After the match, Doug disbanded Revolution causing the members to attack him and Damaja running back into the ring armed with a Louisville Slugger to make the save. Doug then embraced former partner Damaja and his uncle OVW owner Danny Davis, before going to the back shaking hands with the OVW fans thus making him a face.

After disappearing from WWE TV in September 2005, Doug would return to OVW under a new gimmick; &quot;The Superstar of Superstars.&quot; At this time, he came out to the ring using the Superman theme before signing a new deal with WWE in April 2006.

On March 7, 2007, The Basham Brothers returned to OVW and defeated Wyatt Young and Mike Tolar in a dark match.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2007)===
With WWE impressed by his in-ring ability, Doug received numerous try-out matches in late 2002 and early 2003 against opponents such as Mark Jindrak, Charlie Haas, Lenny Lane, Val Venis, Nathan Jones, Redd Dogg, Nova, Johnny Jeter, Horshu, Shannon Moore, and Billy Kidman. He also teamed with the likes of Damaja, Sean O&#x27;Haire, and Bull Buchanan.
Basham made his official debut on the May 29, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as one-half of the tag team, The Basham Brothers with his tag partner Danny Basham. The Basham Brothers debuted as a team on May 29 and defeated the team of Rikishi and Brian Kendrick. The Basham Brothers were later joined by Shaniqua. They were given a bondage-based S&amp;M gimmick and won their first WWE Tag Team Championship from Los Guerreros on the October 23 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The team would go on to lose the titles on the February 5, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty. On February 15 at No Way Out, The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua faced Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi in a handicap match and lost when Shaniqua was pinned by Rikishi. The Basham Brothers would go on to lose their manager Shaniqua when she was sent to OVW for training not long after No Way Out. For the next few months The Basham Brothers were regulars on &quot;Velocity&quot; and appeared on a few occasions on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; generally losing.

The Bashams were given a one-off television appearance on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of the Tough Enough IV qualifiers. The remaining contestants received 30 seconds each to retrieve a flag from the far corner of the ring. Anyone who succeeded within the time limit would be immune from elimination until the next round. However, the Bashams were the obstacles that were put in place to prevent the challengers from reaching the flag. The Bashams managed to resist all seven finalists consecutively. They also teased hot favorite Daniel Puder by letting him get within 1 inch of the flag in his final seconds of his turn. (Puder had become the hot favorite one week earlier when he almost defeated a fresh Kurt Angle in a real wrestling match in seconds immediately after 3 hours of circuit training specifically designed to wear the contestants out.) Impressed by their performance, the tag team were given a push. The Basham Brothers would go on to join John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL)&#x27;s Cabinet faction on November 25 and became known as JBL&#x27;s Co-Secretaries of Defense. Their role was often to sacrifice themselves to prevent JBL from getting harmed after he had provoked an opponent. The Bashams would once again win the WWE Tag Team Championship defeating the teams of Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak, and Eddie Guerrero and Booker T in a four-way elimination match in January 2005. The Basham Brothers lost the titles to Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 20. The Bashams would then win sporadically on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; or defeat any teams that they faced on &quot;Velocity&quot;. The Basham Brothers quit JBL&#x27;s Cabinet on the June 16, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, claiming that they were tired of being &quot;JBL&#x27;s crash test dummies&quot; and not getting enough respect.

On June 30, Danny became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, which saw him jump from SmackDown! over to Raw. This left both men in singles competition in WWE on different brands. Basham would return to television on the August 27 edition of &quot;Velocity&quot; under &quot;The Bash Man&quot; Doug Basham gimmick. The Bash Man came out to the ring wearing sunglasses, a shiny leather vest, and shiny wool pants. Basham continued to work squash matches under this unexplained gimmick sporadically over several months.

While disappearing off WWE television, Basham would return to OVW for several stints before signing a new deal with WWE in April 2006. Both Basham and Danny would reunite in WWE&#x27;s revived ECW brand during July 2006 at several house shows before becoming on-screen unnamed masked &quot;Security Enforcers&quot; for ECW leader Paul Heyman. When Danny was injured with a torn biceps, he was replaced by Derek Neikirk, who continued Danny&#x27;s role as the second masked enforcer.

The Security Team&#x27;s existence came into question after Heyman was removed from WWE television. The team stayed to compete in one handicap match against Bobby Lashley before disappearing from television themselves.

On January 19, 2007, Basham was released by WWE along with a number of other wrestlers.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007)===
Doug Basham or simply Basham and Danny Basham (now known as Damaja) debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the May 10 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;. They were subsequently revealed to be allies of the villainous Christy Hemme, and at Sacrifice, Basham and Damaja defeated Hemme&#x27;s rivals Kip James and Lance Hoyt in a tag team match. On August 15, Basham along with Damaja left TNA wrestling.

===Europe, Return to OVW, and retirement (2008–2009)===
In April 2008, the Bashams wrestled as a team one last time on a weekend tournament for Juggalo Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Slam TV Tour.

In June 2008 Basham went to Ireland working for Irish Whip Wrestling. Later that year he went to England to work for various promotions. Basham returned to OVW for a one night appearance on October 10, 2008, and defeated JD Michaels with Al Barone by disqualification, due to Barone getting involved. He left Europe in March 2009. He returned to North America for his last match on September 5, 2009, for Pro Wrestling Fusion, defeating Francisco Ciatso in Temple Terrance, Florida.

In the fall of 2020, Doug Basham became the Advanced Wrestling Instructor for the Al Snow Wrestling Academy in Louisville, KY.
===Return to wrestling (2022)===
Basham came out of retirement on August 27, 2022, teaming with Al Snow as they defeated Adam Revolver and Joe Mack at OVW&#x27;s The Big One pay-per-view. He retired once again on December 3, 2023.

<doc id="993578" wikidata="Q83170" url="?curid=993578" title="Dalbergia melanoxylon">
<text>Dalbergia melanoxylon (African blackwood, grenadilla, or mpingo) in French &quot;Granadille d&#x27;Afrique&quot; is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to seasonally dry regions of Africa from Senegal east to Eritrea, to southern regions of Tanzania to Mozambique and south to the north-eastern parts of South Africa. The tree is an important timber species in its native areas; it is used in the manufacture of musical instruments, sculptures vinyago in Swahili language and fine furnitures. Populations and genomic resources for genetic biodiversity maintenance in parts of its native range are threatened by overharvesting due to poor or absent conservation planning and by the species&#x27; low germination rates.

African blackwood is a small tree, reaching 4–15 m tall, with grey bark and spiny shoots. The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternate, 6–22 cm long, pinnately compound, with 6–9 alternately arranged leaflets. The flowers are white and produced in dense clusters. The fruit is a pod 3–7 cm long, containing one to two seeds. It is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world.

==Uses==

The dense, lustrous wood ranges in colour from reddish to pure black. It is generally cut into small billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow-white sapwood left on to assist in the slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality &quot;A&quot; grade African blackwood commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The timber is used mainly because of its machinability, density, dimensional stability, and moisture repellence. Those properties are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally clarinets, oboes, transverse flutes, piccolos, recorders, Highland pipes, and Northumbrian pipes. The Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood (&quot;grenadilla&quot;) to construct the tone ring in its John Hartford-model banjo because it weighs less than brass or bronze tone rings, and that the wood &quot;plays in&quot; (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers from ancient Egypt on have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies Wüsthof, Böker and J. A. Henckels sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood&#x27;s moisture repellent qualities.

Due to overuse, the mpingo tree is severely threatened in Kenya and is needing attention in Tanzania and Mozambique. The trees are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, partly because of illegal smuggling of the wood into Kenya, but also because the tree takes upwards of 60 years to mature.

African blackwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with sandalwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.

===Relation to other woods===
* African blackwood is no longer regarded as ebony, a name now reserved for a limited number of timbers yielded by the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot;; these are more of a matte appearance and are more brittle.
* The genus &quot;Dalbergia&quot; yields other notable timbers, widely known as &quot;palisanders&quot; (true rosewoods), such as Brazilian rosewood (&quot;Dalbergia nigra&quot;), &quot;Dalbergia cearensis&quot;, cocobolo (&quot;Dalbergia retusa&quot;) and several others.

==Names==
Other names by which the tree is known include &quot;babanus&quot; and &quot;grenadilla&quot;, which appear as loanwords in various local English dialects.

==Conservation==
There are multiple organisations involved in the conservation of African blackwood: the Mpingo Conservation &amp; Development Initiative, the African Blackwood Conservation Project, and Daraja Music Initiative (formerly Clarinets for Conservation).

The &quot;Mpingo Conservation &amp; Development Initiative&quot; (MCDI, formerly the Mpingo Conservation Project) is involved in research, awareness raising and practical conservation of African blackwood. Conservation of mpingo and its natural habitat can be achieved by ensuring that local people living in mpingo harvesting areas receive a fair share of the revenue created, thus providing them with an incentive to manage the habitat in an environmentally friendly manner. In order to achieve this, the MCDI is helping communities to get Forest Stewardship Certification.

The &quot;African blackwood Conservation Project&quot; works around Mount Kilimanjaro replanting African blackwood trees, and in conservation education. It also works with adult and women&#x27;s groups in the promotion of environmentally sound land uses.

&quot;Daraja Music Initiative&quot; (formerly Clarinets for Conservation) is a U.S.-based non-profit that aims to raise awareness and promote conservation of mpingo through music education in Tanzania. Students participate in an interdisciplinary program during the summer months that raises awareness of the value of mpingo through musical performances, classroom instruction, and tree plantings at local secondary and primary schools.

Small growers in Naples, Florida have been successful in growing African blackwood there. Growth habit in Florida yields taller, larger trees, and the rich soil combined with ample nutrients and long growing season yields timber of superior quality at more sustainable rates.

<doc id="993581" wikidata="Q446405" url="?curid=993581" title="Shoichi Funaki">
<text>(born August 24, 1968) is a Japanese professional wrestling manager, color commentator and retired professional wrestler signed to WWE, where he works as a Japanese-language play-by-play commentator and an occasional interpreter for Japanese talents in the company. During his time as an in-ring performer, he became a one-time Cruiserweight Champion and a one-time Hardcore Champion.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early years (1993–1998)===
Funaki started as a shoot style wrestler in Yoshiaki Fujiwara&#x27;s Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi promotion and moved to its successor promotion, Battlarts. He later found the lucha libre style more to his liking, so he moved to The Great Sasuke&#x27;s promotion, Michinoku Pro Wrestling. In that promotion, he joined with Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Men&#x27;s Teioh and Shiryu in the Kai En Tai stable. Funaki also wrestled in the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) where he won the UWA World Middleweight Championship from El Pantera on March 19, 1997, in Japan.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998-2010)===
====Kai En Tai (1998–2001)====

In March 1998, Funaki, along with Teioh and Togo, joined the World Wrestling Federation. Initially, they feuded with Taka Michinoku and defeated him and his partner John Bradshaw in a 3-on-2 handicap match at Over the Edge: In Your House. They lost to Michinoku and The Headbangers at King of the Ring in a six-man tag team match.

Michinoku eventually turned villainous and joined the group. At SummerSlam, Kai En Tai lost to Oddities members Kurrgan, Giant Silva and Golga in a handicap match. Over time, the stable turned into a tag team, as in 1999, Teioh and Togo (and manager Yamaguchi-san) were given their releases. Michinoku and Funaki were often used for comedic purposes, often having their pre-match promos dubbed—while Michinoku would &quot;deliver&quot; the majority of dialogue for the duo, Funaki would &quot;respond&quot; strongly with a simple &quot;INDEED&quot;.

At WrestleMania 2000, Funaki participated in a 15-minute hardcore battle royal for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Funaki pinned Viscera after a diving shoulder block from Bradshaw but he was later pinned by Rodney. Hardcore Holly ultimately won the match and became the official champion. At Unforgiven, Funaki once again participated in a hardcore battle royal which was won by the defending champion Steve Blackman.

In 2001, Kai En Tai started participating in non-televised matches before pay-per-view events such as the Royal Rumble and Judgment Day.

====&quot;SmackDown!&quot;&#x27;s No. 1 Announcer (2001–2003)====
Michinoku left the WWF in October 2001, resulting in Funaki moving to singles competition. At Survivor Series, Funaki participated in an Immunity Battle Royal which was won by Test. In 2002, Funaki moved to the SmackDown! brand after the WWF roster was split into two brands. He turned face and found himself as a lower card wrestler and adopted the gimmick of &quot;SmackDown!&#x27;s number one announcer&quot;, performing backstage interviews between matches, while competing in the cruiserweight division. As part of SmackDown! brand, Funaki mostly wrestled on &quot;Velocity&quot;. At Rebellion, Funaki defeated Crash Holly. At Vengeance in 2003, Funaki participated in the APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl which was won by Bradshaw. For the rest of 2003, Funaki worked in house shows and made occasional appearances on Velocity with less TV time.

====Cruiserweight Champion (2004–2005)====
On the March 4, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki lost to Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero Jr. in a non-title match. On the March 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki participated in an 8-man cruiserweight tag team match teaming with fellow cruiserweights Rey Mysterio, Último Dragón and Billy Kidman against Tajiri, Akio, Sakoda and Jamie Noble. At WrestleMania XX, Funaki participated in a Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship but was pinned by Jamie Noble.

On the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki won a cruiserweight over the top rope number one contender&#x27;s battle royal which included Chavo Guerrero, Paul London, Billy Kidman, Akio, Shannon Moore and Nunzio. At Armageddon, Funaki defeated Spike Dudley to win the Cruiserweight Championship. Funaki successfully defended the title against Spike Dudley, Akio and Nunzio. His last successful title defense was against Chavo Guerrero on the February 10, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, notably held in Funaki&#x27;s birth country, Japan.

====Cruiserweight Division (2005–2008)====

Funaki lost the championship to Chavo Guerrero in a six-man Cruiserweight Open match at No Way Out. At Armageddon, he lost to Jamie Noble in a match on &quot;Heat&quot;. During an interview with then Cruiserweight Champion Kid Kash on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki was assaulted by Kash, who gave him a brainbuster onto the interview platform.

At the Royal Rumble, Funaki faced Kid Kash in a match for the title, when he was entered into a Cruiserweight Open along with four other Cruiserweight champions, including the champion Kash. Funaki was pinned in this one fall match by then Raw superstar Gregory Helms, who won the match and title. At No Way Out, Funaki participated in a Nine Man Cruiserweight Match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship but Helms retained the title. Since that time Funaki, would regularly team with Scotty 2 Hotty during episodes of &quot;Velocity&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. During one such &quot;Velocity&quot; taping, however, Funaki suffered a 2nd Grade concussion, where he was unconscious for just under two minutes. Funaki would resume wrestling later that year, forming a tag team of sorts with Scotty 2 Hotty, which was mainly used to put over debuting wrestlers or tag teams.

Funaki made a one-off appearance at the Puroresu King Indy Summit, on December 31, 2006, reuniting with Kai En Tai DX in what was being billed as a Kai En Tai DX Revival Ten-Man Tag Match; Funaki reteamed with Taka Michinoku, Kaz Hayashi, Dick Togo and Men&#x27;s Teioh to face five other wrestlers. Funaki returned to WWE television on the February 16, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a brawl that involved the other &quot;SmackDown!&quot; cruiserweights and the then-Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms.

At No Way Out, Funaki participated in a Cruiserweight Open match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship but was pinned by the champion Helms. On the May 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki was made short work of by recently returned superstar Mark Henry. On the June 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Funaki got a shot at the Cruiserweight title against Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero and Jamie Noble, but came up short. At The Great American Bash, he participated in a match for the Cruiserweight Championship which Hornswoggle won. On the December 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he wrestled in a squash match against Edge. He also made a televised appearance on January 4, 2008, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; where he lost to Chavo Guerrero in a Beat the Clock match. He suffered a defeat to The Great Khali on April 21, 2008, in Khali&#x27;s SmackDown return match. On June 6, 2008 Funaki appeared on SmackDown&#x27;s main event teaming with Batista, Colin Delaney and Nunzio defeating Edge, Chavio Guerrero, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder. Funaki legitimately broke his nose at a joint SmackDown/ECW taping in Houston, Texas, during a dark match against Vladimir Kozlov.

====Kung Fu Naki (2008–2010)====
On October 10, 2008, Funaki revealed his full name to be &quot;Kung Fu Naki&quot; during a backstage segment with R-Truth. This was used as the basis for a gimmick change for Funaki; he then came to the ring dressed in a gi and tweaked his moveset to incorporate theatrical martial arts moves. His first match as Kung Fu Naki saw him scoring a pinfall win over Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Shelton Benjamin in a tag team match with R-Truth. Kung Fu Naki then defeated MVP in a singles match on the November 14, 2008 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; when The Great Khali interfered and distracted MVP. His first loss in the character was against WWE Champion Edge on the December 5, 2008, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. He wrestled in house shows until March 2009. He was inexplicably absent from WWE action until WrestleMania XXVI, where he took part in the 26 Man Battle Royal match, which was won by Yoshi Tatsu. On April 22, 2010, WWE released Funaki, ending his 12-year stint with the company.

===Return to Japan and Independent circuit (2010–2015)===
After his WWE release, Pro Wrestling Zero1 announced they had signed Funaki to return to Japan and team with his former student Ikuto Hidaka.

On December 4, 2010, San Antonio, Texas–based Branded Outlaw Wrestling (BOW) announced that it had reached a working agreement with Funaki to host his new professional wrestling school, named the Funaki Dojo. The school&#x27;s first class started on January 15, 2011.

On December 6, 2013, at TNA One Night Only: World Cup of Wrestling, as a part of Team International, Funaki and Petey Williams lost to Team Aces &amp; Eights&#x27; DOC and Knux.

On December 6, 2014, Funaki worked for the Japanese Pro Wrestling Noah promotion, teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty and Super Crazy in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Pesadilla, Yoshinari Ogawa and Zack Sabre Jr., with Scotty 2 Hotty pinning Pesadilla for the win.

Funaki wrestled his last matches in Japan for Dradition Pro-Wrestling in October 2015, retiring from wrestling.

===Return to WWE (2011-present)===
====Sporadic appearances (2011–2016)====
Funaki cameoed for WWE as a special guest referee during their house shows in Japan in 2011 and 2013.

Funaki made a special appearance in a video as a translator for Kenta&#x27;s first WWE interview with Renee Young. In September, Funaki returned to WWE&#x27;s developmental program NXT to feud with The Ascension alongside Kenta, who was now going by the name Hideo Itami.

==== Japanese commentator (2016–present)====
Funaki would appear in the WWE Network show, &quot;The Edge and Christian Show&quot;, introducing the hosts, with his voice dubbed over by Howard Finkel in the first season and Luke Gallows in the second season.

On April 1, 2016, at NXT Takeover: Dallas, Funaki appeared in a backstage segment with Shinsuke Nakamura. Funaki would later appear at ringside sitting next to Kota Ibushi.

Since WrestleMania 32, Funaki has been one-half of the Japanese commentary team for all WWE pay-per-view events, while also continuing his duties as an interpreter for Japanese wrestlers in backstage interviews.

In an exclusive interview for WWE&#x27;s YouTube channel after the final match of the WWE Mae Young Classic on September 12, 2017, Funaki served as Kairi Sane&#x27;s interpreter.

Starting in September 2024, Funaki made appearances on NXT as a translator for Giulia.

==Funaki Dojo==

Funaki opened his training facility, Funaki Dojo in San Antonio, Texas in June 2012.

==Personal life==
Along with Japanese and English, Funaki is fluent in French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. He was a regular on WWE&#x27;s short-lived Spanish-language show &quot;Los Super Astros&quot;, which was televised on Univision.

On August 30, 2007, Funaki, along with nine other superstars, were named in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as recipients of illegal steroids not in compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Funaki was said to have received somatropin in March 2006.

<text>Milichius is a bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Mare Insularum. To the southeast is the slightly larger Hortensius, a similar formation.
Further away due east of Milichius is the prominent and well-known Copernicus.

Further away due east of Milichius is the prominent and well-known Copernicus.

The crater is named after 16th century German doctor, mathematician and astronomer Jacob Milich, Latinized as &quot;Milichius&quot;.

Just to the west is a typical lunar dome designated Milichius Pi (π) that has a tiny craterlet at the peak. The narrow and sinuous Rima Milichius rille is located farther to the southwest, and follows a course running roughly north–south for 100 kilometers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Milichius.

<text>Desmond Macready Chute (1895–1962) was an English poet and artist, who became a Catholic priest in 1927.

==Early life==
He was born in Bristol, the son of James Macready Chute (1856–1912) and his wife Abigail Philomena Henessy (1855–1931). His father ran the Prince&#x27;s Theatre, Bristol, the family business. His mother was the second daughter of Joseph Henessy of Richmond Terrace, Clifton, Bristol, a cattle-dealer: the Henessy family were Irish Catholics, Liberal in politics. Abigail Chute was on good terms with Grace Mary Welch of Cheltenham, mother of Werburg Welch who later became a close friend of Desmond.

Chute was educated from 1906 at Downside School, where he was taught by the classicist Nevile Hunter Watts. He went on in 1912 to the Slade School of Art in London. In 1913 he exhibited some paintings, and in 1914 he had a show of portraits at the New English Art Club. His mother had taken over the Bristol theatre on his father&#x27;s death in 1912, and on the outbreak of war in 1914 Chute returned to Bristol to support her. Brocard Sewell concludes that he was exempt from military service during World War I.

Chute was a close friend of Stanley Spencer, from 1915, and the period when Spencer was a medical orderly at the Beaufort War Hospital in the Bristol area. During the war years and into the 1920s he was encouraging Spencer to become a Catholic convert. In a letter of 1928 to Richard Carline, Spencer alluded to a passage in &quot;Confessions&quot;, a work given to him in 1916 by Chute, as a religious influence.

==Ditchling and the Third Order of Saint Dominic==

In 1918 Chute encountered Eric Gill at work in Westminster Cathedral. The contact resulted in Chute&#x27;s participation in the craft community at Ditchling, Sussex. It had grown up over the previous decade around Gill and others. Chute became a close colleague, assistant and &quot;beloved brother&quot; of Gill.

Gill completed his work on the Stations of the Cross in the cathedral, and it was consecrated on Good Friday 1918. He had been exempted from conscription while he was engaged on the task. He was called up in September of that year, to a Royal Air Force camp at Blandford. He left Chute in charge at Ditchling, and he oversaw Gill&#x27;s household and workshop. He worked under Gill of a set of Stations of the Cross, for John O&#x27;Connor at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church in Bradford. He published poetry in &quot;The Game&quot;, the community&#x27;s magazine. His mother was a principal patron of the Guild in its early days.

In 1920 Gill and his wife Mary, Chute, Hilary Pepler and Herbert Shove became Tertiaries, joining the lay Third Order of Saint Dominic. Chute was already a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis. Chute, Gill and Pepler went on to found The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic. Influential in this further step was Vincent McNabb OP. Gill knew him already, having met McNabb at the Edinburgh house of André Raffalovich. McNabb provided an economic theory and pointed to the works of Thomas Aquinas. Pepler&#x27;s St. Dominic&#x27;s Press published works by McNabb and other Catholic writers, illustrated by Chute, Philip Hagreen and other Ditchling artists. Some years later the ruralist views of McNabb found expression in Distributism.

David Jones arrived in Ditchling in 1921, as an assistant to Gill. Chute befriended him, and taught him wood carving. That year, Chute started to study for the Catholic priesthood, in Fribourg at the Albertinum, the international Dominican priory there. He put the Bristolian Douglas Cleverdon in touch with Gill in the mid-1920s.

==Priest in Italy==
Chute&#x27;s studies to become a priest were interrupted by bouts of tuberculosis. He was ordained priest on 25 September 1927, at Downside School. He then moved for his health to Rapallo, Italy.

There Chute knew Ezra Pound, Olga Rudge, and the &quot;Tigullian Circle&quot; musical society they promoted. He also knew Max Beerbohm. He had English visitors, including at Christmas 1936 the Gills, and Christopher Dawson and his wife. He did work for the Apostleship of the Sea at Genoa, which had papal recognition.

Chute tutored Mary de Rachewiltz, Pound&#x27;s daughter with Olga Rudge. This was during the period 1941 to 1943, and Mary gave an account of him in her memoirs:

Thin and very tall, a long, pale face, with lots of hair and a beard (dyed red), melodramatically stretched out on couches with layers of capes and blankets and three kinds of curtains at the windows that had to be drawn at the least change of light outside, a series of eyeglasses and eyeshades and reading lamps. His health was poor, his eyesight very delicate.

Another account, by the physician Pietro Berri:

...the figure of a priest, tall, but of a wan complexion, with a beard at one time golden, but gradually streaked with grey, always sporting dark glasses for the greater protection of his sight, or an eyeshade ...

Chute supported Mary and her mother when Pound was arrested and deported by the US army. In the last year of World War II, Chute himself was deported from Rapallo and held prisoner. He was interned at Bobbio, where he worked in a hospital.

Chute&#x27;s radio play &quot;Poets in Paradise&quot; was broadcast by the BBC in 1955.

==Death and legacy==
Chute died and was buried in Rapallo. According to his wishes, his grave carried the inscription &quot;Pulvis attamen sacerdos&quot; (dust yet a priest). A memorial designed by Eric Gill stands in Canford Cemetery, Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. Some of his papers are held in the Eric Gill Collection at Chichester, and others by his relation, David Charles Manners.

<doc id="993589" wikidata="Q7075550" url="?curid=993589" title="Obstruction (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, obstruction is when a fielder illegally hinders a baserunner running within the basepath. Baserunners are generally permitted to run from base to base without being physically blocked or hindered by a fielder. The only time that a fielder is not obligated to &quot;get out of the way&quot; of a baserunner is when the fielder is fielding a hit ball or in possession of the ball.

==Definition==
Official Baseball Rule 2.00 defines obstruction as:

The comment to Rule 7.09(j) adds that
High school and college versions of the rule also add rules against malicious or flagrant contact.

==Types of obstruction and corresponding penalties==
Any case of obstruction falls into one of two categories (formerly called type &quot;A&quot; and type &quot;B&quot; until the 2014 rewriting of the MLB Umpire rulebook), after the subsection of Rule 6.01(h), in which each type of obstruction, and the corresponding penalties, are described.

(1)

(2)

In addition, the fielder who commits the obstruction is charged with an fielding error. As with a catcher&#x27;s interference call, if the obstruction allows the batter to safely reach first base, unlike other fielding errors the batter is not charged with an at bat.

==Common misconceptions==
There need not be physical contact for obstruction to be called; if a fielder causes the runner to alter his normal running path, or deliberately blocks his view of the plate, he can be guilty of obstruction.

Obstruction is not the same as interference; obstruction is committed by a fielder against a base runner, while interference, with the exception of catcher&#x27;s interference, is committed by a baserunner against a fielder or a batter against a catcher. When a fielder hinders a base runner, baseball commentators (including the announcers of the 2013 game discussed below) will often mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference.

==Notable cases of obstruction==

On August 6, 2004, a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field ended with a Devil Rays victory on an obstruction call. With one out and the score tied 1–1 in the bottom of the tenth inning, the Devil Rays&#x27; Carl Crawford was taking a lead off of third base when Tino Martinez hit a fly ball toward Mariners left fielder Raúl Ibañez. Crawford went back to third base as if he was going to consider tagging up and trying to score after the ball was caught. Mariners shortstop José López moved to a spot that was between Crawford and Ibañez. Ibañez caught the ball, and Crawford bluffed a run toward home; he then stopped and was heading back toward third base as Ibañez&#x27;s throw sailed toward home plate. However, third base umpire Paul Emmel ruled that López had blocked Crawford&#x27;s view of left fielder Ibañez, thus preventing Crawford from seeing when the ball was caught and when he could leave third base and head toward home plate. Emmel called obstruction on the ground that López&#x27;s action, within the language of the rule, had &quot;impede[d] the progress of&quot; Crawford by not letting him see precisely when it was safe for him to leave the base. Emmel awarded Crawford home plate, and that was the winning run. The play involved &quot;Type A&quot; obstruction, as a play was being made on Crawford at the time of the obstruction because Ibañez threw the ball home to prevent him from scoring. The play also demonstrated how it is not necessary for a fielder to make physical contact with a runner or physically impede the runner&#x27;s running path to be called for obstruction.

On October 4, 2003, in Game 3 of the 2003 American League Division Series between the Oakland A&#x27;s and the Red Sox, the A&#x27;s Miguel Tejada was called out after he apparently misunderstood the obstruction rule. Tejada was on second base when teammate Ramón Hernández hit a ground ball into left field for a hit. Tejada rounded third and collided with Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller, who was trying to get into position to receive a throw from left fielder Manny Ramirez. Umpire Bill Welke called obstruction. Incorrectly thinking that the play was over and that he was entitled to home plate automatically, Tejada slowed to a jog and headed toward home. The Red Sox, however, threw the ball to catcher Jason Varitek who caught the ball long before Tejada reached home and easily tagged him out. Tejada had failed to realize that, because a play was not being made on him at the time of Mueller&#x27;s obstruction, the obstruction was &quot;Type B&quot; obstruction. Therefore, under Rule 7.06(b), Welke&#x27;s call was only preliminary, the ball was still live, and the play was supposed to &quot;proceed until no further action [was] possible,&quot; at which point the umpires would judge whether Tejada would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred. Tejada was called out after Varitek tagged him with the live ball because, in light of his jogging, the umpires could not say that he would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred.

On October 26, 2013, Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was decided by a controversial obstruction call. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Allen Craig of the St. Louis Cardinals was impeded by Boston Red Sox third-baseman Will Middlebrooks, who had fallen to the ground trying to catch a wild throw from Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia. As a result, the third-base umpire, Jim Joyce, ruled obstruction, and thus Craig was awarded home plate and the Cardinals won the game 5–4. This play involved &quot;Type B&quot; obstruction, because no play was being made on Craig at the time that the obstruction occurred. Saltalamacchia&#x27;s throw had already gone into left field before Craig tripped over Middlebrooks&#x27;s body while trying to head home.

The difference between the play on Tejada and the play that ended Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was that, in the 2013 game, Allen Craig got up after he tripped over Middlebrooks and ran hard toward home plate, where he was tagged by catcher Saltalamacchia just before he slid into the plate. Home plate umpire Dana DeMuth then made the final call that Craig was safe because he would have scored if Middlebrooks&#x27;s obstruction had not occurred.

According to David Smith, baseball historian and founder of Retrosheet, as of October 2013, the 2004 and 2013 games described above were the only games that ever ended on an obstruction call.

==History==
The rule against obstruction was first formalized as part of the 1856 version of the National Association of Base Ball Players rules. The current language of the Official Rules was introduced in 1962, and modified in 2019.

<doc id="993600" wikidata="Q5250072" url="?curid=993600" title="Deep (Peter Murphy album)">
<text>Deep is the third solo studio album by English musician Peter Murphy. Produced by Simon Rogers, the album was released on 19 December 1989 through Beggars Banquet Records in the UK and RCA (original issue)/Atlantic Records (reissue) in the US. The album features contributions from Murphy&#x27;s backing band, The Hundred Men.

The album spawned three singles: &quot;The Line Between the Devil&#x27;s Teeth (And That Which Cannot Be Repeat)&quot;, &quot;Cuts You Up&quot; and &quot;A Strange Kind of Love&quot;. The track &quot;Cuts You Up&quot; became a modern rock hit in 1990, spending seven weeks at the top of the U.S. charts and crossing over to &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number 55. The other singles also charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at numbers 18 and 21, respectively.

== Critical reception ==

Ned Raggett of AllMusic praised the album, stating that &quot;&quot;Deep&quot; showed Murphy balancing mass appeal and his own distinct art with perfection,&quot; and also wrote that &quot;Murphy simply sounds like he&#x27;s having the time of his life, singing both for the sheer joy of it and for the dramatic power of his commanding voice.&quot;

<doc id="993603" wikidata="Q438647" url="?curid=993603" title="Shannon Moore">
<text>Shannon Moore (born July 27, 1979) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his work with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1999 and 2001 and with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for several years in the 2000s. He has also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He currently wrestles for Atomic Legacy Wrestling (ALW) where he is the current ALW Heavyweight Champion in his 3rd reign.

Moore befriended Matt and Jeff Hardy as a child, and they later trained him to wrestle. He debuted in 1995 and competed for several North Carolina–based promotions, winning several Light Heavyweight Championships. He also wrestled for the Hardys&#x27; promotion, Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), where he won the OMEGA Light Heavyweight Championship twice and the OMEGA New Frontiers Championship once. In 1999, he signed with WCW, and became part of 3 Count, a boy band parody. The three members of 3 Count jointly won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000. In 2001, he briefly held the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship with Shane Helms.

He later joined the then-WWF in 2001 and was assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association, a developmental territory, where he won the HWA Tag Team Championship with Evan Karagias. After debuting on the SmackDown brand, he became a follower of &#x27;Mattitude&#x27; and appeared regularly as Matt Hardy&#x27;s sidekick. Between late 2003 and 2005, Moore was used mainly in WWE&#x27;s cruiserweight division, until his release in July 2005. After a stint on the independent circuit, Moore joined TNA in December 2005. In March 2006, he re-signed with WWE, initially appearing on the ECW brand, before returning to SmackDown in 2007. He formed a tag team with Jimmy Wang Yang, and the pair challenged unsuccessfully for the WWE Tag Team Championship on several occasions. Following his release in August 2008, he once again returned to the independent circuit, before rejoining TNA in January 2010. He soon formed a tag team, known as Ink Inc., with Jesse Neal in April.

Aside from wrestling, Moore is also a tattoo artist and owned a tattoo parlor known as Gas Chamber Ink in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He is also a musician, having written his own entrance music, and was part of the band Peroxwhy?gen with Jeff Hardy.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1995–1999)===
Moore befriended Matt and Jeff Hardy as a child and competed in their own backyard wrestling circuit. After the Hardy brothers began wrestling professionally, they trained Moore and he debuted on April 8, 1995 against Jeff. Moore began working on the independent circuit, wrestling for the North Carolina-based Southern Championship Wrestling and National Championship Wrestling promotions as &quot;Kid Dynamo&quot;, and won the Light Heavyweight Championship in both. In addition, he frequently wrestled for Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), the promotion operated by the Hardys. In OMEGA, he won the OMEGA New Frontiers Championship once, and the OMEGA Light Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. During his time in OMEGA, he met Gregory Shane Helms, and the pair later formed the Bad Street Boys with Christian York and Joey Matthews in NWA Worldwide. In the late 1990s, Moore began wrestling for the Tennessee-based Music City Wrestling promotion.

===World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001)===

In 1999, Moore was hired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by Chris Kanyon, who had been granted the authority to employ twenty-one young cruiserweights for the Atlanta-based promotion. He was placed in a faction known as &quot;3 Count&quot; by Jimmy Hart. 3 Count, which consisted of Moore, Evan Karagias and Shane Helms, was a trio of young male wrestlers who utilized a boy band gimmick, parodying bands like the Backstreet Boys and &#x27;N Sync. 3 Count debuted in WCW in November 1999. and they began lip synching the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out Of My Heart&quot; in the ring before their matches. On the February 28, 2000 episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in Minneapolis, Minnesota, all three members of 3 Count defeated Brian Knobs to win the WCW Hardcore Championship with all 3 members of the team simultaneously pinning him. 3 Count reigned as &quot;co-champions&quot; until March 19, at Uncensored where Knobs regained the title by pinning all three men consecutively.

3 Count were not involved in the Millionaire&#x27;s Club versus The New Blood angle that took place in mid-2000 because Helms was legitimately sidelined with a broken nose. When the team reconvened late in the summer of 2000, they began performing a new song, &quot;Dance With 3 Count&quot;. In storyline, Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial artist Tank Abbott became an avid fan of 3 Count, and he began protecting them during their performances, attacking anyone who disrupted them, eventually acting as their talent manager and occasional inserting himself as a back-up dancer. 3 Count were involved with a long-running feud (scripted rivalry) with The Jung Dragons, with the Dragons attempting to steal 3 Count&#x27;s fictional recording contract. This led to a ladder match between the two teams at New Blood Rising, which 3 Count won due to Abbott&#x27;s interference. As a result, Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count, and was kicked out by the other three members, leading to a feud. Following this, 3 Count briefly feuded with Misfits In Action.

In late 2000, 3 Count began to fall apart, with Moore and Helms kicking Karagias out of the group for continually stealing the spotlight. Karagias joined forces with former Jung Dragons member Jamie Knoble and the three teams met in a Triangle match at Mayhem, which 3 Count won. At Starrcade, the six men faced off in a ladder match for the number contendership to the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same time, and later wrestled for the opportunity to face the champion, which Helms won.

In 2001, Moore and Helms briefly appeared in NWA Wildside, where they held the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship for a single day, after defeating Suicidal Tendencies (John Phoenix and Adam Jacobs) on January 19, 2001. Moore and Helms both participated in a cruiserweight elimination match at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, in which Helms eliminated Moore and went on to win the match. Following the match, Moore and former partner Karagias attacked Helms. Moore and Karagias joined forces once again to take part in a tournament for the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship, but were eliminated by Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio

===World Wrestling Federation/ Entertainment (2001–2005)===

==== Developmental (2001–2002) ====
In March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation purchased WCW, which included Moore&#x27;s contract. Moore was assigned to the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), a Louisville-based WWF developmental territory. There, he teamed with Evan Karagias, and the two won the HWA Tag Team Championship on October 13, 2001, by defeating Dean and Chet Jablonski. They held the championship for a month, before losing it to The Island Boyz on November 14. In early 2002, Moore won the HWA Cruiserweight Championship on two occasions.

==== Mattitude follower (2002–2003) ====
In July 2002, Moore was assigned to the SmackDown! brand, initially appearing on &quot;Velocity&quot;. In December, Moore became a heel (villainous) acolyte of Matt Hardy, who had begun proselytizing a philosophy known as &quot;Mattitude&quot; and calling himself &quot;Matt Hardy Version 1.0&quot;. Moore became a &quot;Mattitude Follower&quot; (abbreviated &quot;MF&#x27;er&quot;) and started dressing like Hardy, accompanying him to ringside and interfering in his matches. Moore helped Hardy to lose several pounds in order to qualify for a WWE Cruiserweight Championship match at No Way Out. During the championship match, Moore distracted champion Billy Kidman to enable Hardy to get the win and the championship. On April 24, Crash Holly was revealed as the newest MF&#x27;er. He was subordinate to Moore and, as such, was referred to as a &quot;Moore-on&quot;. When Hardy was displeased with either Moore or Holly, he would physically attack them. Holly was later released from WWE on June 30. On September 23, Moore and Hardy challenged Los Guerreros for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful.

==== Singles competition (2003–2005) ====

Moore and Hardy continued to work together until November 17, when Hardy left SmackDown! and joined the Raw brand. As a result, Paul Heyman, SmackDown!&#x27;s then-general manager, decided to punish Hardy vicariously for leaving his show by forcing Moore to face a series of much larger opponents. In successive weeks, Moore was squashed by Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, and The Big Show before unexpectedly defeating A-Train in an upset on the December 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The following week, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar was scheduled to defend the championship against a wrestler chosen by a lottery machine, which produced Moore&#x27;s name. After defeating Moore, Lesnar revealed that the process had been rigged, and Moore&#x27;s name was on all the balls. Immediately afterward, Moore teamed with Hardcore Holly to defeat A-Train and Morgan, earning Holly a championship match against Lesnar. In 2004, at WrestleMania XX Moore took part in a &quot;Cruiserweight Open&quot; for the Cruiserweight Championship, but was eliminated by Último Dragón. His next high profile appearance was on the July 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which saw Moore wrestle under a mask as &quot;El Gran Luchadore&quot; to face John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in the match for the WWE Championship. Initially Moore was dominated by his much larger opponent, but a second Luchadore (the disguised Eddie Guerrero) took Moore&#x27;s place, prompting Layfield to run away and giving Moore the victory by countout. For the remainder of 2004 and early 2005, Moore competed in the cruiserweight division and on &quot;Velocity&quot;. Moore received a WWE Championship match on the December 30, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, but was quickly defeated by JBL. Moore appeared at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February 2005, competing in a gauntlet match for the Cruiserweight Championship, but was eliminated by Paul London.

On March 21 he suffered a concussion and whiplash after his Hummer was involved in a head-on collision with a vehicle driven by an inebriated United States Army Sergeant in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He quickly recovered from his injuries, but was released by WWE on July 5.

===Independent circuit (2005–2006)===
Moore returned to the independent circuit soon thereafter, although the no-compete clause in his contract (which prohibits WWE employees who are fired or who negotiate a contract release from appearing on television within a given time period) did not expire until November 1 of that year. Moore appeared at an AWA Superstars of Wrestling show, competing in a tournament for the WSL World Light Heavyweight Championship. Moore defeated Dexter Poindexter, Ricky Landell, and &quot;Amazing&quot; N8 Mattson before losing to &quot;Krazy K&quot; Kirby Mack in the finals. Over the next few months, he wrestled Davey Richards at a Pro Wrestling WAR event, J.J. Perez at an All Pro Wrestling show, and Sonjay Dutt at Universal Uproar. He also wrestled A.J. Styles on a United Wrestling Association charity show on February 2, 2006.

During this time, Moore opened a professional wrestling school known as the &quot;School of Punk&quot;.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2006)===

Moore made his Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) television debut on the December 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, appearing in the rafters of the Impact Zone and holding a sign reading &quot;X Division needs to get Punk&#x27;d&quot;. Upon joining the roster, he gained the nickname the &quot;Prince of Punk&quot;. He appeared again in the rafters on the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

On the December 31 episode, Moore was seen standing on the stage once again, before he attacked A.J. Styles during a tag team match on the special midnight episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, preventing him from winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Christopher Daniels. This attack prompted a feud between Moore and Styles, with Moore stalking Styles, attacking him and stealing his &quot;Mr. TNA&quot; award plaque. This led to a street fight between the two, which Moore won. On the February 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Moore faced Roderick Strong and Jay Lethal in a three-way match for a place on Team USA, but the match was won by Lethal. Moore then teamed with Samoa Joe to defeat Styles and Daniels. Moore&#x27;s final match as part of TNA aired on the March 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when he, America&#x27;s Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Alex Shelley lost to Styles, Daniels, Ron Killings, and Rhino.

===Return to WWE (2006–2008)===

==== Prince of Punk (2006–2007) ====

On March 17, 2006, WWE released an interview with Moore talking about his imminent return to the company. In July 2006, Moore began appearing as part of WWE&#x27;s ECW brand, making his first appearances in vignettes calling himself &quot;The Reject&quot;. His in-ring debut was a loss to CM Punk on September 12, a week before Punk had confronted Moore and called him a &quot;poser&quot; before slapping him. After one more loss to Punk, Moore made only sporadic appearances throughout the rest of 2006 and early 2007, losing each time.

On the February 16, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Moore suddenly switched brands, appearing in an in-ring brawl with other &quot;SmackDown!&quot; cruiserweights, which was a prelude to a Cruiserweight Open at No Way Out. Moore was eliminated from the Cruiserweight Open by the defending WWE Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms. Moore then established himself as a fan favorite by teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty and Jimmy Wang Yang to defeat Helms, Chavo Guerrero Jr., and Daivari in a six-man tag team match.

Following a hiatus from television, Moore returned on the June 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, competing in a fatal four-way number one contender match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which was won by Wang Yang and also involved Daivari and Jamie Noble. The following week, Moore teamed with Wang Yang in a losing effort against Guerrero and Noble. Moore competed in the 20-man battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship in July, but was the third person to be eliminated. He also competed in the &quot;Cruiserweight Open&quot; at The Great American Bash along with Noble, Funaki, Wang Yang, and Guerrero. The match was inadvertently won by Hornswoggle. He also faced Noble and Guerrero, in losing efforts. Moore began feuding with Noble, appearing in several backstage vignettes together, where he mocked Noble for his obsession with Hornswoggle. Moore defeated Noble on the September 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, by pretending that Hornswoggle was at ringside, distracting Noble and allowing Moore to pin him for the victory. In a rematch two weeks later, Noble pinned Moore.

==== Teaming with Jimmy Wang Yang and Departure (2007–2008) ====

In October 2007, Moore formed a tag team with Yang, with the two defeating Deuce &#x27;n Domino. They later competed in a tag team battle royal to determine the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the November 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, but were the second team eliminated. In December, Moore and Yang challenged John Morrison and the Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful, igniting a feud between the two teams. The following week on &quot;ECW&quot;, Moore and Yang defeated Morrison and The Miz in a non-title match, to earn a rematch for the championship. On January 1, 2008, Moore and Wang Yang once again beat Morrison and the Miz, this time in a six-person tag team match also involving Layla and Kelly Kelly. The following week, in a Fifteen Minutes of Fame Match, Moore and Wang Yang tied the champions on pinfalls, meaning Miz and Morrison retained the championship. Throughout late January and February, Moore and Yang moved into a feud with Deuce &#x27;n Domino, defeating them two weeks in a row. On the February 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Moore, Yang, and Jesse and Festus defeated Deuce &#x27;n Domino and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in an eight-man tag team match on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. In April, Moore and Yang reignited their feud with Morrison and The Miz, losing to them twice in tag team encounters. Yang and Moore went on to win singles matches against Morrison and The Miz respectively, earning another match for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the May 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, but were unsuccessful once again.

After this feud ended, Moore was rarely utilized. On August 8, 2008, WWE announced that Moore had been released from his WWE contract.

===Return to independent circuit (2008–2009)===
On September 28, 2008, Moore won the World Stars of Wrestling World Championship by defeating Joe E. Legend. Two months later, on November 22, Moore won the Free-Style Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Mot Van Kunder; however, he lost it immediately afterwards to Rico Bushido.

In mid-2009, Moore took a six-month hiatus from wrestling.

During November, Moore participated in the Hulkamania tour of Australia, where he took part in a best of three match series for a prize of US$25,000 with Spartan 3000. Spartan won the first match on November 21, and Moore won the second on November 24. The rubber match ended in a draw on November 26, resulting in a ladder match for the final match of the tour, which Spartan won.

===Return to TNA (2010–2012)===
On the first live Monday edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; on January 4, 2010, Moore made his return to TNA by celebrating backstage with Jeff Hardy, after Hardy had also made his return to the company. On February 19, Dixie Carter confirmed that Moore had signed a new contract with TNA. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Moore attacked the TNA X Division Champion Doug Williams, and Eric Bischoff announced that Moore would face Williams for the X Division Championship at Destination X. At the pay-per-view Williams retained his title, after hitting Moore with a brick. Moore&#x27;s first victory since his return to TNA came on the March 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; in a tag team match when he pinned Brian Kendrick. At Lockdown Moore received another shot at the now vacant X Division Championship in a three-way steel cage match, where he faced Homicide and the eventual winner of the match, Kazarian.

In April, Moore insulted the TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan, provoking a rivalry between the two. The following week Morgan cost Moore his shot at the TNA X Division Championship, and later attacked his tag team partner Jesse Neal. Moore aided Neal, prompting the pair to form a tag team known as Ink Inc. At Sacrifice Ink Inc. failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from The Band (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), when Neal&#x27;s trainer Brother Ray interfered in the match and attacked Neal. The following month, on the June 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ink Inc. defeated The Band (Kevin Nash and Eric Young) to advance to the finals of a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. In the final, Ink Inc. was defeated by Beer Money, Inc. when Brother Ray attacked Neal backstage prior to the match. At Bound for Glory, Ink Inc. defeated Eric Young and Orlando Jordan. On the October 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ink Inc. received a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship against The Motor City Machine Guns in a three-way match, which also included Generation Me (Max and Jeremy Buck), but failed to win the championship. On December 5 at the Final Resolution pay-per-view, Ink Inc. lost to Beer Money, Inc. in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Ink Inc. received a match for Beer Money&#x27;s TNA World Tag Team Championship at Victory Road in March 2011, but were unsuccessful. After the match Moore turned heel by refusing to shake hands with the champions and instead spat beer in Storm&#x27;s face. On April 17 at Lockdown, Ink Inc. defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), Crimson and Scott Steiner and Eric Young and Orlando Jordan in a four team steel cage match to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Sacrifice, Ink Inc. was defeated by Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). During the match, Neal suffered a neck injury, which sidelined him for the next four months.
As a result, Moore returned to singles competition and on July 10 at Destination X, Moore participated in his first Ultimate X match, for a shot at the X Division Championship, but was defeated by Alex Shelley in the match, which also included Amazing Red and Robbie E. Ink Inc. returned on the September 22 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, attacking Mexican America, now the TNA World Tag Team Champions, at a tattoo parlour. On the October 13 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Toxxin aligned herself with Ink Inc. by saving them from Mexican America. On October 16, during the Bound for Glory pre-show, Ink Inc. unsuccessfully challenged Mexican America for the TNA World Tag Team Championship and at Turning Point the following month, they again failed to win the championship in a six-person tag team match, which also included Toxxin and Mexican America&#x27;s Sarita. In December, Neal parted ways with TNA, effectively dissolving Ink Inc.

On the December 22 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Moore teamed up with Anarquia in the Wild Card Tournament but lost to Eric Young and ODB. Following a brief hiatus, Moore returned on February 12, 2012, at Against All Odds, answering Robbie E&#x27;s open invitational and unsuccessfully challenging him for the TNA Television Championship. On May 31, Moore announced that he would not be returning to TNA due to a neck injury.

===Second return to independent circuit (2012–present)===
After leaving TNA in 2012 with a neck injury, Moore did not wrestle for approximately two years, and on July 6, 2014, he announced on Twitter that he is finished with in-ring competition. Despite this, Moore returned to wrestling on December 14, 2014, at Xtreme Intense Championship Wrestling (XICW)&#x27;s &quot;Hardcore With A Heart&quot;; he defeated Hakim Zane to win the XICW Midwest Heavyweight Championship. On January 17, 2015, at &quot;Best in Detroit 8&quot; Moore lost the XICW Midwest Heavyweight Title to Rhyno. On December 3, 2016, at Full Throttle Pro Wrestling Event &quot;Fight Club: Round 2&quot; Moore defeated Braydon Knight and became the inaugural FTPW Heavyweight Champion. On May 19, 2017, at Atomic Wrestling Entertainment Event &quot;Mayhem&quot; Moore defeated Cj O&#x27;Doyle for the AWE Heavyweight Title.

<text>Love Hysteria is the second solo album by the British solo artist Peter Murphy, formerly of the gothic rock band Bauhaus. It was released in 1988.

The album was largely written with former B-Movie keyboard player Paul Statham, who had joined Murphy&#x27;s band, The Hundred Men. It was produced by former member of The Fall, Simon Rogers.

==Critical reception==
A review at the time of its release in &quot;Underground&quot; described the album as &quot;a coherent, tuneful package with tracks that are, on the whole, pretty listenable&quot;. Ned Raggett, writing for Allmusic, identified a continuing David Bowie influence, but stated that the album &quot;shows Murphy fully coming into his own as a performer&quot;.

<doc id="993622" wikidata="Q133615" url="?curid=993622" title="Abulfeda (crater)">
<text>Abulfeda is a lunar impact crater located in the central highlands of the Moon. To the northeast is the crater Descartes, and to the south-southeast is Almanon. To the north is the crater Dollond. A chain of craters named the Catena Abulfeda runs between the southern rim of Abulfeda and the north rim of Almanon, then continues for a length of 210 kilometers across the Rupes Altai. The crater was named for 14th century Kurdish historian Ismael Abul-fida.

Both the south and northeast sides of the crater rim are overlain by multiple small craterlets. The inner wall is noticeably wider in the east, and shallow and worn to the north. The crater floor has been resurfaced, either by &quot;ejecta&quot; from the Mare Imbrium or by basaltic lava, and is relatively smooth and featureless. The crater lacks a central rise at the midpoint, which may have been buried. The inner sides appear to have been somewhat smoothed down, most likely as a result of minor bombardment and seismic shaking from other impacts in the vicinity.

Abulfeda is a crater of Nectarian age.

A crater chain along the southern rim of Abulfeda was considered for a landing site of an early Apollo mission, primarily because it was considered to be a typical highland site, and at the time, crater chains were thought to possibly be volcanic in nature (rather than of impact origin).
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Abulfeda.

<text>Polmont () is a village in the Falkirk council area of Central Scotland. It lies towards the east of the town of Falkirk, north of the Union Canal, which runs adjacent to the village.

Due to its situation in Central Scotland, many locations can be seen from Polmont, ranging from the Ochil Hills and the River Forth, to Cairnpapple Hill. Although giving its name to Polmont Young Offenders Institution, the prison is in fact in Reddingmuirhead.

== History ==
The name Polmont derives from the Scottish Gaelic term &quot;Poll-Mhonadh&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;Pool of the Hill&quot;.

Old Polmont was situated on a raised beach overlooking the Firth of Forth and the Ochils. There were two Roman temporary marching camps, one on either side of what is now Grangemouth Golf Course: on the western side was Little Kerse, and on the eastern side was Polmont Hill. The Antonine Wall ran through Polmont from Mumrills, the largest fort on the wall, west of Polmont. Remains of the wall can best be seen in Polmont Woods, accessed by a footpath next to the M9 motorway bridge.
The first mention of Polmont was in 1498, relating to the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The next mention was in the Statistical Accounts of Scotland. Old Polmont has changed little as can be seen from this 1862 Map but, in 1968, the first section of the M9 motorway cut through farm land between Old and New Polmont.

Polmont was originally included within the parish of Falkirk, but was severed under the authority of the Court of Teinds (&quot;teind&quot; is the Scots word for tithe), and made an independent parish, in 1724. The parish boundary was from the Firth of Forth up to Muiravonside, and it was later renamed Grangemouth Parish as the port of Grangemouth grew. Nothing of the early history of Polmont has been recorded.

New Polmont was built along the Great North Road (A9), south of Old Polmont, and was originally called Bennetstown or Bennestone (named after the Laird of Whyteside, Mr Bennet, on whose land it was built. Apart from housing, agricultural workshops and stores, it also had three public houses: The Crown, The Red Lion and The Black Bull, but only The Black Bull remains and dates from before 1745. Map of Polmont 1860. The village slowly expanded after World War II with housing being built on land of former estates of Millfield, Polmont Park, and Polmont House. From the mid-1970s, the population significantly expanded when housing was built on the Gilston Estate, whereupon the village was re-designated as a dormitory town.

During World War II, the now-demolished St Margaret&#x27;s School for girls was used for signals training by Polish forces, and soldiers from various Polish units were assigned there.

==Notable residents==

*John Gibb Dunlop (1844–1913), director of John Brown and Company creator of both RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; and RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot;
*Gilbert Laurie of Polmont (1729–1809), Lord Provost of Edinburgh
*Johan Theodor Salvesen (1820–1865), joint founder of Christian Salvesen
*James Smith (1808–1863) came to Polmont Bank House with his daughter Madeleine Smith to escape the notoriety raised by her infamous murder trial. He died there broken by the affair. She married and moved to America.

== Politics ==
Polmont is within the jurisdiction of Falkirk Council, although the suggestion of east Polmont changing hands for the purposes of the Westminster Parliamentary Constituency to Linlithgow and East Falkirk arose, but was soon discounted.
In May 2007, the Polmont area merged as part of an expanded Lower Braes seat, as proposed for Falkirk Council by the Scottish Executive.

Lord Polmont is a subsidiary title of the Duke of Hamilton. This title was originally given to the 2nd Duke of Hamilton in 1639.

One of the current councillors for Polmont (and the rest of the Lower Braes Ward) in Falkirk Council is Scottish Conservative Councillor Malcolm Nicol, who has held the role since 2000 following the death of his predecessor, Frank Hodge. He previously represented a seat in Grangemouth, originally being elected in 1983. SNP Councillor Steven Jackson has also represented Polmont, which is part of the larger Lower Braes Ward, since May 2007, being elected for the first time through the Single Transferable Vote system.

Polmont is unusual for a town in the Falkirk area in that a local by-election in 2000 saw a Conservative candidate returned with over half of the popular vote.

== Economy ==

The economy of Polmont is based mainly upon relatively small scale private enterprise, such as pubs, cafes, hotels, take-aways and convenience stores. The majority of these are based in or around Polmont shopping centre, the focal point of local custom. Agriculture is also a central industry, with arable land consuming a sizeable proportion of the area. Polmont is home to the controversial Avondale Landfill, a large employer on the east of the village.

Due to the proximity to Grangemouth, a number of the population work at the Grangemouth refineries and port. Few of the population work in Polmont itself, leaving it something of a commuter town, largely to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

There are several hotels in the area, with the most well known being the Inchyra Grange, a redevelopment from one of the area&#x27;s many former mansions.

== Transport ==

Polmont railway station is located on the Edinburgh to Glasgow railway line. In 1984 a train collided with a cow that had strayed onto the rail line near Polmont. The crash left 13 people dead and 61 others injured.

The M9 motorway runs through the village between Polmont and Old Polmont, with two exit points on the east and west sides. There are numerous bus stops throughout the village, primarily situated on Polmont Main Street, which provide direct bus services to Edinburgh, Falkirk and Stirling. The nearest airport, Edinburgh Airport, is located approximately to the east.

==Education==
Polmont has provided primary level education since the 1700s. The original Parish School still stands across from the church; however, in the 1960s Polmont Primary School became overcrowded and relocated to a set of interlinked wooden huts on Greenpark Drive. Polmont Primary&#x27;s colours are green and silver reflected in the uniform of green blazer, green/silver tie, grey shorts/skirts and white shirts/blouses. Further expansion of Polmont meant that the school again became overcrowded; finally, a permanent structure was built in the south west of Polmont and renamed St Margaret&#x27;s Primary School. St. Margaret&#x27;s had been the name of a private school that had stood between 1895 and 1948 on the site of houses that are now on the west side of Stevenson Avenue.

== Culture ==
Polmont Parish Church was designed by John Tait in 1844.

Polmont is a parish and its religious community is primarily Christian, being home to a Church of Scotland in Old Polmont. The area also has a Christian denominational presence in the form of the Church of the Brethren and the Religious Society of Friends.

Scottish rock band Glasvegas have a song entitled &quot;Polmont On My Mind&quot; on their debut album, &quot;Glasvegas&quot;.

Parkhill House and grounds were used as a location in the fourth season of Outlander (TV series) It was transformed into a graveyard and was filmed over a few evenings

The grounds of the former Millfield House folly still remains including its bowling green with steps at either side which is flanked by two beautiful Canadian redwoods at either side.It also has remains of a Lily pond and wildfowl lake.The burn at the side was also sloped with stone and has trickle waterfalls along its length

Polmont won best small town in Scotland in Bloom awards 2023 for the first time ever.

== Sport ==

===Football===

Polmont has an amateur football club. Since the 2014–15 season they have played in Division One Stirling &amp; District AFA. The club play their home games at Meadowbank Bank, St. Margaret&#x27;s in the east of the village. There was once a junior club representing the area but the club only lasted a few years. Another club, Rumford Rovers, played at senior level briefly in the 1890s.

The most famous sporting export of Polmont is Alex Raisbeck, who spent several years captaining Liverpool. He also represented Scotland on eight occasions, and was considered to have been one of the finest players of his generation, dating back to 1898. He captained Liverpool to their first ever English championship title in 1901 and did so again five years later.

The highest-profile Polmontarian currently playing at senior level is Derek Niven, formerly of Chesterfield.

===Other sports===
Despite its name, Grangemouth Golf Club is located on the outskirts of Polmont.

Within the boundaries of Grangemouth Golf Club is Millhall Reservoir, which is now a fishery. To the east of the clubhouse is Polmont Ski Centre, which includes an artificial ski slope.

<text>Lawren Stewart Harris LL. D. (October 23, 1885 – January 29, 1970) was a Canadian painter, best known as one of the founding members of the Group of Seven. He played a key role as a catalyst in Canadian art, as a visionary in Canadian landscape art and in the development of modern art in Canada.

==Early years==
Harris was born on October 23, 1885, in Brantford, Ontario. He was the son of Thomas Morgan Harris and Annabelle Stewart. His father was secretary to the firm of A. Harris, Sons &amp; Company Ltd., merchants of farm machinery, which merged with the Massey firm in 1891, forming the Massey-Harris Company, later known as Massey Ferguson. Lawren Harris&#x27;s share of the fortune that resulted made him free from financial cares the rest of his life. Although born to wealth, he was an individual who made his own path in his own individual way. In 1894, his father died and the family moved to Toronto. In 1899, he began to board at St. Andrew&#x27;s College, which was located in Rosedale in Toronto at the time, then in 1903 attended University College at the University of Toronto. 

From 1904 to 1908 he studied in Berlin under Adolf Schlabitz, Franz Skarbina, and most likely Fritz von Wille, gaining an academic foundation similar to that which was offered by the Paris academies. Harris stayed in Berlin for three years, learning about Impressionism and Post-Impressionism as well as seeing exhibitions of German and European modern art. Among these exhibitions were several of the Berlin Secession and a comprehensive review of 19th century German art. In 1908 he travelled to Austria, Italy, France and England before returning to Toronto. 
He brought back an influence not only from his teachers but from the Secessionist movement he had encountered in Berlin. Through his reading and teachers, he may also have learned about Theosophy.

==Career==

In Toronto, to which he returned in 1908, Harris found friends through the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto which he joined in 1909, making friends with journalist Roy Mitchell, another early member. In 1910, he became interested in philosophy and Eastern thought, likely through Mitchell, and began discussing Theosophy seriously (although it was not until 1924 that he formally joined the Toronto Lodge of the International Theosophical Society). From 1910 to 1918, he focused in his painting on the urban landscape of Toronto, featuring a significantly brightened palette, an attention to light, and a layered development of space in order to convey a sense of place. In 1911, he met and became friends with J. E. H. MacDonald who was exhibiting sketches in the clubroom of the Club. Harris and MacDonald went on sketching trips and together visited the exhibition of contemporary Scandinavian art in Buffalo at the Albright Gallery (today, the Albright-Knox Gallery) in 1913. Seeing it, they realized that they too could create a landscape art that was distinctly Canadian and modern.

In 1913, Harris took the first step that would cement a group of like minded artists together in Canadian art, by inviting A. Y. Jackson, then in Montreal, to Toronto. The following year, he and his friend Dr. James MacCallum, financed the construction of a Studio Building in Toronto which provided artists, among them Tom Thomson, with an inexpensive space to work. In 1915, Harris fixed up a shack behind the Studio Building for Thomson whose art and dedication to his career proved inspirational for Harris. 

In March 1916, Harris enlisted in the Canadian Army for service in the First World War. He was appointed a Lieutenant attached to the 10th Royal Grenadiers and served as a Musketry Instructional Officer at Camp Borden until May 1918 when he was medically discharged, suffering a nervous breakdown. 

==Boxcar trips==
In 1918 and 1919, Harris financed boxcar trips for the artists of the later Group of Seven to the Algoma region, traveling along the Algoma Central Railway and painting in areas such as the Montreal River and Agawa Canyon. His work showed the effect of such trips: he began sketching in oil en plein air as a regular practice and used the sketches as a guide in constructing his major canvases.

==Formation of the group in 1920==

In May 1920, Harris, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Franklin Carmichael, A. Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, and Frederick Varley, formed the Group of Seven.

==Lake Superior==
In the fall of 1921, Harris in the company of Jackson ventured beyond Algoma to Lake Superior&#x27;s North Shore, where he would return annually for the next seven years. They took the Algoma Central Railway north to Franz, where they caught the Canadian Pacific train travelling west. 

Harris would return to paint and draw on the north shore of Lake Superior almost every October until 1928. While his urban and Algoma paintings of the late 1910s and early 1920s were characterized by rich, bright colours and decorative compositional motifs, the discovery of Lake Superior as a source of subject material meant the depiction of features of the landscape in light over a vast body of water to compose a &quot;sublime order&quot;, as described by Jackson. Harris conveyed the spiritual side to the scene through a more austere, stylized style, with a limited palette.

==Rocky Mountain==
In 1924, a sketching trip with Jackson to Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rockies marked the beginning of Harris&#x27; mountain subjects, which he continued to explore with annual sketching trips until 1928, exploring areas around Banff National Park, Yoho National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park. 

==Greenland==
In 1930, Harris went on his last extended sketching trip, travelling to Greenland, the Canadian Arctic and Labrador aboard the Royal Canadian Mounted Police supply ship and ice breaker, the SS. Beothic, for two months, during which time he completed over 50 sketches. The resulting Arctic canvases that he developed from the oil panels marked the end of his landscape period.

==Modernism and Harris==
Harris&#x27;s artistic career was one of constant exploration. He was the only member of the Group of Seven to align himself with European and American forms of Modernism. He always had been deeply interested in developments in modern art. In 1926, he represented Canada in the &quot;International Exhibition of Modern Art&quot; organized by the Société Anonyme (of which he was a member) and shown at the Brooklyn Museum in New York: he helped bring the show to Toronto in 1927. In 1934, he painted his first abstract pictures, which depended partly on his desire to express ideas of the spirit, partly on his earlier landscapes of Lake Superior, the Rocky Mountains and the Arctic. In these years, he moved to Hanover, New Hampshire in 1934, then Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1938 and finally, Vancouver in 1940. After a period of experimentation, from 1936 on, Harris enthusiastically embraced abstract painting. 

When asked in 1937 by Emily Carr to describe his recent work, Harris wrote: Well, they are all different and yet alike—some more abstract than others—some verging on the representational—one never knows where the specific work in hand will lead. I try always to keep away from the representational however—for it seems the further I can keep away and into abstract idiom the more expressive the things become—yet one has in mind and heart the informing spirit of great Nature.
In time, he left all reference to landscape behind, and his work underwent changes towards a more organic form. He wrote about the path an abstract artist took from representation to abstraction to become fully abstract in an &quot;Essay on Abstract Painting&quot; published in 1949. In the 1950s, he painted his version of abstract expressionism. In 1954, in a separate publication that developed from his earlier essay on abstraction, he praised abstraction, writing: 
...(in abstract art), we have a creative adventure in harmony with the highest aspiration and search for truth, beauty and expressive evocation and communication in our own day&quot;.

==Memberships in art organizations==
In May 1920, Harris, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Franklin Carmichael, A. Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, and Frederick Varley, formed the Group of Seven. After disbanding of the Group of Seven in 1933, Harris and the other surviving members, were instrumental in forming its successor the Canadian Group of Painters. Harris served as its first president. In 1938, he helped organize the Transcendental Group of Painters in the United States. In 1941, he was a founder of the Federation of Canadian Artists, founded in Toronto and President (1944-1947).

==Honours==
In 1926, his work won a gold medal at Sesquicentennial International Exposition of Philadelphia. In 1931, he won the Baltimore Museum of Art prize in the first Baltimore Pan-American Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings. In 1946, Harris was awarded an honorary degree from the University of British Columbia. He received an L.L.D. from the University of Toronto in 1951. In 1953, he received an L.L. D. from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg. In 1961, he received the Canada Council medal for 1961. In 1969, he was given a Medal from the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1970, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, conferred posthumously.

Harris has been designated as an Historic Person in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations.

==Personal life==
On January 20, 1910, Harris married Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips. The couple had three children: Lawren P. Harris, Margaret Anne Harris, and Howard K. Harris, all born in the first decade of their marriage. Harris later fell in love with Bess, the wife of his school-time friend, F.B. Housser, but divorce was seen at the time as causing an outrage, particularly for a man as socially prominent as Harris.

Harris eventually left his wife of 24 years, Trixie, and married Bess Housser in 1934. He was threatened with charges of bigamy by Trixie’s family because of his actions. Later that year he and Bess left their home and moved to the United States. In 1940 they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. Bess died in 1969. Harris died in Vancouver in 1970. His ashes and those of Bess are buried on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg.

==Legacy==
In Toronto, a park in Rosedale at 145 Rosedale Valley Road was named for him. A solo exhibition of Lawren Harris was shown in the United States at the Americas Society Art Gallery in New York. In 2015, a travelling exhibition of Harris’ work, &quot;The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris&quot;, curated by Steve Martin, opened at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, California. In 2016, a film about Harris&#x27;s life, &quot;Where the Universe Sings&quot;, was produced by TV Ontario. It was created by filmmaker Peter Raymont and directed by Nancy Lang. In 2017, guest curators Roald Nasgaard and Gwendolyn Owens, organized an exhibition titled &quot;Higher States: Lawren S. Harris and his North American Contemporaries&quot;, comprising some seventy paintings at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection. It featured works by Canadian and American contemporaries of Harris&#x27; such as Bertram Brooker, Emily Carr, Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald, Arthur Dove, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Raymond Jonson, Emil Bisttram and Marsden Hartley.

==Record sale prices==
In 1981, &quot;South Shore, Baffin Island&quot; was sold for $240,000, a record price for a Canadian painting. On May 29, 2001, Harris&#x27;s &quot;Baffin Island&quot; painting was sold for a record of $2.2 million (record up to that time). Before the auction, experts predicted the painting done by one of the original Group of Seven would top $1 million, but no one expected it to fetch more than twice that amount. The painting, which has always been in private hands, depicts icy white mountains with a dramatic blue sky. In 2005, Harris&#x27;s painting, &quot;Algoma Hill,&quot; was sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $1.38 million. It had been stored in a backroom closet of a Toronto hospital for years and was almost forgotten about until cleaning staff found it.

On May 23, 2007, &quot;Pine Tree and Red House, Winter, City Painting II&quot; by Harris came up for auction by Heffel Gallery in Vancouver, BC. The painting was a stunning canvas from 1924 that was estimated to sell between $800,000 and $1,200,000. The painting sold for a record-breaking $2,875,000 (premium included). On November 24, 2008, Harris&#x27;s &quot;Nerke, Greenland&quot; painting sold at a Toronto auction for $2 million (four times the pre-sale estimate).

On November 26, 2009, Harris&#x27;s oil sketch, &quot;The Old Stump&quot;, sold for $3.51 million at an auction in Toronto. In May 2010, Harris&#x27;s painting, &quot;Bylot Island I&quot;, sold for $2.8 million at a Heffel Gallery auction in Vancouver, British Columbia. On November 26, 2015, his painting &quot;Mountain and Glacier&quot; was auctioned for $3.9 million at a Heffel Fine Art Auction House auction in Toronto, breaking the previous record for the sale of one of Harris&#x27;s works. Another piece, &quot;Winter Landscape&quot;, sold for a hammer price of $3.1 million in the same auction. On November 23, 2016, &quot;Mountain Forms&quot;, estimated at $3–5 million, sold for $11.2 million at the Heffel Auction, the present high.

<doc id="993641" wikidata="Q2068558" url="?curid=993641" title="Lauren Harris">
<text>Lauren Harris (born 6 July 1984) is a British rock singer and classically trained actress. She is the daughter of Steve Harris, the bassist of Iron Maiden, and Lorraine Harris. After completing her primary and secondary education at Saint Nicholas School, Old Harlow, Essex, Harris attended Leventhorpe School, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, where she obtained her A-Levels, including Theatre Studies.

Harris began her music career singing in pubs in 2005, and went on to record demo material for Russ Ballard, before touring with Iron Maiden and releasing her debut album, &quot;Calm Before The Storm&quot;, in 2008. From 2010, Harris toured with her new hard rock band, Six Hour Sundown, performing at venues in the UK as well as the European Graspop, Download, and Sonisphere festivals. She frequently performs barefoot. Harris commenced a new musical project, Kingdom of I, working with songwriter Dave Stewart and drummer Shauney Recke.

Harris is a graduate of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the Oxford School of Drama and has appeared in numerous stage productions, highlighting with a London production as the role of Blanche Dubois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Harris has appeared in the feature film &quot;Adrift in Soho&quot;.

==Career==
===Music===
Harris began singing in pubs and bars with a friend; after one of the performances, she was invited to Russ Ballard&#x27;s house and studio to record a demo.

From 2005 to 2008, Harris worked with Grammy-nominated songwriter and producer Tom McWilliams, who assisted with song arrangement and composition. McWilliams also toured with Harris, performing as the band&#x27;s drummer.

Harris toured Europe, playing outdoor festivals such as the German Rock Am Ring, Rock Am Park and UK Download festivals.

Harris supported Iron Maiden on their &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; world tour, playing at Dubai and the Brixton Academy, London, amongst other venues. When the tour concluded, Harris released her debut album entitled &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot;, mixed by Kevin Shirley. She continued to tour the UK and Europe in support of the release. Harris joined Iron Maiden again, this time on the &quot;Somewhere Back In Time World&quot; tour.

In addition to supporting Iron Maiden, between 2006 and 2009 the Lauren Harris Band toured as a support act with bands such as Alice Cooper, Within Temptation, and Mötley Crüe.

In 2008 Harris named musical influences including Belinda Carlisle, Shakespears Sister, Alanis Morissette, Heart, Def Leppard and the Foo Fighters.

From 2010, following lineup changes, the Lauren Harris Band began touring under the new name &quot;Six Hour Sundown&quot;. The band recorded new tracks at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas but only &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; saw commercial release, becoming available as a single for Download in 2011. The band played numerous festivals before deciding to part ways in late 2012.

In 2013, Harris moved to Los Angeles to commence work on a new musical project, Kingdom of I, with songwriter and producer Dave Stewart and drummer Shauney Recke. The debut track &quot;Crying at the Disco&quot; was released as a free download on Soundcloud in late 2013.

A Spotify playlist posted to the official Kingdom of I Facebook, intended to give a flavour for the type of music to expect on the album, cited musical influences such as Flyleaf, Muse, Paramore, Stone Sour, Annie Lennox and Stevie Nicks.

===Acting===
While in Los Angeles to work on Kingdom of I, Harris undertook classes in acting at Howard Fine Studios. She continued her training by completing a semester in classical acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 2014. In September 2016, Harris graduated from a one-year postgraduate course in acting at the Oxford School of Drama.

Between 2013 and 2015, Harris completed work in principal photography for the feature film, &quot;Adrift In Soho&quot;, which was released in 2018.

In September 2013, Harris was named as one of &quot;Variety Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;10 Brits To Watch&quot;.

Harris has appeared in numerous stage productions, including &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; at London&#x27;s Pack and Carriage and &quot;Measure For Measure&quot; at Oxford&#x27;s North Wall, which received favourable reviews. In November 2016, she appeared in the role of Beth Armstrong for the BBC Radio 4 play &quot;Michael and Boris: The Two Brexiteers&quot;.

Harris&#x27; musical experience has influenced her acting career, with her recording an original song for a commercial for the technology company Eizo, and her role as the Witch in a production of the musical &quot;Into The Woods&quot; at the Oxford School of Drama.

In November 2016, Harris appeared in the role of sound technician in the music video for Bring Me the Horizon’s single &quot;Oh No&quot;. Harris’ other work includes Global commercial roles for the companies Eizo Global, Active Digital, and Coms Plc.

On 15 April 2011 he left XFM to present the weekend breakfast show on Capital Radio (now known as &quot;Capital London&quot;).

<text>Robert William Howard (born January 29, 1963) is an American professional wrestler better known by the ring name Hardcore Holly. He is best known for his tenure in WWE.

After debuting in 1987, Holly worked for World Organization of Wrestling, Smoky Mountain Wrestling, and other independent promotions, before joining WWE full-time in 1994. Initially portraying the character of a NASCAR driver, Thurman &quot;Sparky&quot; Plugg, his name was soon changed to Bob &quot;Spark Plug&quot; Holly. In 1998, under the name of Bombastic Bob, he formed a team with Bart Gunn known as The Midnight Express. Towards the end of that same year, Howard reverted to the Bob Holly name as he joined the stable titled The J.O.B. Squad.

After the disintegration of The J.O.B. Squad in early 1999, Howard won his first singles title in WWE and shortly after he became known simply as Hardcore Holly, developing a stern and punishing persona in the process. After taking up the Hardcore Holly gimmick, he was joined by on-screen cousins Crash in 1999 and Molly in 2000.

In 2002, Hardcore Holly suffered a broken neck during a match with Brock Lesnar, which sidelined him for over a year. Upon his return, he engaged in a major feud with Lesnar for the WWE Championship and minor feuds with other wrestlers, such as Mr. Kennedy and Rob Van Dam. He later formed a tag team combination with Cody Rhodes in 2007. Holly was released from WWE in 2009, wrestling only intermittently on the independent circuit afterwards. He published his autobiography, &quot;The Hardcore Truth: The Bob Holly Story&quot;, in 2013.

Championships held by Holly over the course of his career include the WWF/E World Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, and WWF Hardcore Championship.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Glendale, California, where he and his older brother were raised by his mother. After his mother remarried, the family relocated to Ventura, California and then to Grants Pass, Oregon, where Howard attended Grants Pass High School. After graduating, Howard worked in a beer warehouse before moving to Mobile, Alabama with the mother of his daughter, Stephanie. Howard spent several years working as a mechanic for Meineke (supplementing his income by boxing in bars) before joining Taylor Wharton as a pipe cutter, where he trained as a welder. Howard later moved to Cowin Equipment, where he worked as a mechanic and welder.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1987–1990)===
Holly trained under Bob Sweetan, Marcelle Pringle, and Rip Tyler, and debuted in 1987 in the Mobile area in the World Organization Of Wrestling promotion where he held titles on and off, including the WOW Tag Team Championship with Ron Starr when they defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express.

From there, he wrestled in Memphis and then in the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance) with moderate success.

===World Championship Wrestling (1990–1991)===
In 1990, Holly began making television appearances in World Championship Wrestling under the name &quot;Bob Holly&quot;, being utilized primarily as a jobber. His first match came on July 30 in Gainesville, Georgia, when he was defeated via submission by WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger. Holly then wrestled in a six-man match in Marietta, Georgia on August 6, teaming with Tim &quot;Powerhouse&quot; Parker and Brad Bratton against Ric Flair, Arn Anderson and Barry Windham. On August 13 Holly faced Flair in a singles match that aired on &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, losing via submission. After an absence of several months, he made a final appearance at a &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; taping on January 21 teaming with Dave Johnson in an unsuccessful effort against The Freebirds in a match that aired February 9, 1991.

===World Wrestling Federation (1991)===
Two months later Holly made his initial appearance in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Again, he was portrayed as a jobber using the name &quot;Bob Holly&quot;. His sole match was teaming with Mike Sample in a loss to The Bushwhackers on the March 30 edition of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; (match was taped on March 11 in Pensacola, Florida).

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1991–1992)===
Holly joined Jim Cornette&#x27;s new Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion and made his debut at the company&#x27;s very first television taping on October 30 in Greenville, South Carolina, defeating Tim Frye. Billed as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Bob Holly, he received a televised push and portrayed a snobbish-street thug, West Coast character. Afterward, he worked for Buck Robley and The NWF out of Louisiana. He teamed with Robert Gibson there as the Rock N Roll Express. In 1993, Holly did not wrestle at all that year and took a hiatus.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1994–2009)===
====Spark Plug (1994–1997)====

Holly returned to the WWF on January 11, 1994. His initial gimmick was that of a NASCAR driver turned wrestler called Thurman &quot;Sparky&quot; Plugg, by late summer 1994, Holly changed his name to Bob &quot;Spark Plugg&quot; Holly, according to Holly, he went to Vince McMahon and asked him to change his name because he didn&#x27;t like the &quot;Thurman&quot; name and that his friends and family were teasing him over the name but wanted to keep the NASCAR gimmick and McMahon agreed. He competed in the 1994 Royal Rumble match, lasting over 21 minutes.

Bob Holly alongside 1-2-3 Kid took part at WWF World Tag Team Championship Tournament (1995). After defeating Well Dunn and Heavenly Bodies, they reached to the finals which was held at Royal Rumble. At the Royal Rumble in January 1995, Holly and the 1–2–3 Kid defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka to crown new WWF Tag Team Champions. Their title reign lasted only one day, however, as the next day, on &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot;, Holly and the Kid lost the tag team title to The Smoking Gunns.

On the May 7, 1995 (taped April 26, 1995) episode of &quot;WWF Action Zone&quot;, Holly pinned WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in a title match, but as Jarrett had his foot on the ropes the title was vacated. Later on in the show, Jarrett defeated Holly in a rematch for the vacant title after pinning Holly with a roll-up. Holly&#x27;s title win is no longer recognized by WWE. Holly then competed in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Mantaur to qualify before losing to The Roadie in the quarterfinals. He was then the first WWF pay-per-view opponent of Hunter Hearst Helmsley, losing to him at &quot;SummerSlam&quot;. 

At &quot;Survivor Series&quot;, Holly was a part of the Underdogs team along with Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, and Barry Horowitz. They were defeated by the Body Donnas team of Skip, Doctor of Desire Tom Prichard, Rad Radford, and the 1–2–3 Kid.

Despite lasting nearly 40 minutes in the Royal Rumble, Holly made very few television appearances in the WWF throughout 1996 and 1997. In 1997 he scored two victories over Owen Hart on May 19 episode of Raw by pinfall and Brian Pillman on August 4 episode of Raw by countout. Afterwards, Holly was inactive during the rest of 1997 and temporarily went back to welding.

====The Midnight Express; J.O.B. Squad (1998–1999)====
In February 1998, he returned after six month hiatus with a newly blonde hair and Bart Gunn joined forces with Jim Cornette as part of Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s National Wrestling Alliance stable. Holly, renamed &quot;Bombastic Bob&quot;, and Gunn, renamed &quot;Bodacious Bart&quot; were known collectively as The Midnight Express. The Midnight Express defeated The Headbangers for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on March 30, 1998 and held the titles until August 14 of that year, when they were defeated by The Border Patrol. They challenged the New Age Outlaws for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the King of the Ring pay-per-view, but were unsuccessful.

In mid-1998, Holly competed in the WWF Brawl for All, a 16-man shootfighting tournament. He was eliminated in the first round by the eventual winner, Bart Gunn, who defeated him on points; Holly has the distinction of being the only one of Gunn&#x27;s opponents he was unable to knock out. They disbanded in July and Holly went on his own working in lower card matches on &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. 

In November 1998, Al Snow, Holly, and Scorpio united and formed The J.O.B. Squad (later members of the stable also included Gillberg and The Blue Meanie). During that same month on an edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, they helped Mankind defeat Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man in a triple threat match, as Mankind (though not a member of the stable) became a close associate. At 1998&#x27;s Survivor Series pay-per-view, Holly and Scorpio defeated The Legion of Doom (Animal and Droz) in a warmup match. Two months later at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Holly and Scorpio notably defeated Too Much in one of the warmup matches.

In February 1999, the members gradually drifted apart: Scorpio was released by the WWF, Gillberg was later phased out of storylines, and The Blue Meanie allied with Goldust; thus, after dwindling down to only two members, Snow wrestled against himself on an edition of &quot;Raw&quot; before Holly came down to the ring to prevent Snow from hurting himself. The two fought and it led to the formal breakup of the J.O.B. Squad. Later that month at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House, Holly defeated Snow for the WWF Hardcore Championship to permanently end the J.O.B. Squad. A week later on &quot;Raw&quot;, for his title defense match against former partner Bart Gunn, Holly formally changed his name to Hardcore Holly.

====Hardcore Champion and The Holly Cousins (1999–2001)====

Holly dropped the championship to Billy Gunn on the March 15, 1999 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, but regained the title two weeks later at WrestleMania XV, in a triple threat hardcore match also involving Al Snow. He lost the title to Al Snow at Backlash, and soon began referring to himself as &quot;The Big Shot&quot;, feuding with Big Show and Kane. On the August 16, 1999 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly introduced his on-screen &quot;cousin&quot; Crash Holly. 

They unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam. Although simultaneously arguing over who was the better Holly, they won the WWF Tag Team Championship on the October 18, 1999 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, by defeating the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection, after Triple H interfered. They lost the titles two weeks later to Mankind and Al Snow on the November 4 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; The Holly Cousins and Too Cool defeated Edge, Christian and The Hardy Boyz in a traditional four-on-four elimination match at Survivor Series, where Holly was the lone survivor.

On the November 18, 1999 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly challenged The Big Show for the WWF Championship, but was defeated. In early 2000, Hardcore Holly pursued the Intercontinental Championship, losing a match against Chyna due to interference from Chris Jericho. He then lost a Triple Threat Match against Chyna and Jericho for the championship at the Royal Rumble, which was won by Jericho. He lost two more subsequent matches to Jericho for the title, ending their feud.

After Crash Holly won the Hardcore Championship on the February 24, 2000 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the cousins began feuding over the title. Holly won the Hardcore Championship in a &quot;hardcore&quot; 13-man battle royal at WrestleMania 2000. He lost the title back to Crash the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;. He then sporadically challenged for both the Intercontinental and Hardcore championships the following months. Holly then missed several months of ring time due to a legitimately broken arm, suffered in a match with Kurt Angle on the June 29, 2000 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. After his return, later in 2000, another on-screen cousin, Molly Holly was introduced. Holly returned on the November 13, 2000 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Holly, Crash Holly and The Undertaker defeated Edge, Christian, and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag match. At Survivor Series, Holly faced William Regal for the WWF European Championship but lost by disqualification. Holly got a rematch at the title at Armageddon but was defeated by Regal. At the Royal Rumble, Holly competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by The Undertaker. In February, Holly won the Hardcore title three more times, but each time re-lost the title moments later under the &quot;24/7 Hardcore rule&quot;. Holly competed in the King of the Ring tournament but lost to Kurt Angle in the first round. Then Holly continued teaming with Crash until December 2001.

====Feud with Brock Lesnar and neck injury (2002–2004)====

In early 2002, Howard worked as one of a collection of trainer/hosts for &quot;Tough Enough II&quot;, a reality competition TV series produced by WWE and MTV where participants underwent professional wrestling training and competed for a contract with WWE.

In 2002, Holly turned heel on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and began a short feud with Randy Orton. He then had a minor feud with Kurt Angle after eliminating him from a battle royal, turning him face again. On the September 12, 2002, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly suffered a broken neck during a match against Brock Lesnar, when he was powerbombed neck first on the mat. He had a thirteen-month hiatus from wrestling after surgery.

While awaiting surgery, Holly made a guest appearance on &quot;Tough Enough III&quot;. The show caused some controversy when, during the course of a practice match, Howard stiffed a competitor, Matt Cappotelli, leaving him bleeding. Cappotelli later said that there was no ill-feeling between the two because of the incident.

In October 2003, Holly began training at Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE&#x27;s developmental territory, in preparation for his return to the main roster. Holly returned at the Survivor Series pay-per-view on November 16 for revenge against Lesnar for his neck injury. He challenged Lesnar to a match for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, but lost.

====Various storylines (2004–2006)====
During 2004 and early 2005, he formed short-lived tag teams with Billy Gunn, and later Charlie Haas in the hunt for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but was unsuccessful with both partners. He also failed to claim the WWE Championship from John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in a hardcore match on the October 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.
In mid-2005, Holly went into singles competition trying to acquire the United States Championship from Orlando Jordan. After being defeated twice by Jordan, Holly finally managed to pick up a non-title win over Jordan via disqualification on &quot;WWE Velocity&quot;, which aired on August 6, 2005. Holly then entered a short feud with SmackDown! newcomer, Mr. Kennedy. This feud climaxed on October 9, 2005, at No Mercy, where Kennedy defeated Holly after a Green Bay Plunge.

Holly then underwent several surgeries to repair nagging injuries. He was hospitalized after a staph infection developed in a right arm wound. The infection was possibly career-threatening, as doctors were worried at one point that the arm may have to undergo amputation. The subsequent treatments were a success, however.

====ECW championship pursuit (2006–2007)====

Holly made a surprise appearance at WWE&#x27;s ECW house show event on August 21, 2006, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, defeating Balls Mahoney. Holly made his ECW television debut the next night, August 22, appearing in a promo with Paul Heyman, and later attacking Rob Van Dam and Danny Doring during a match. Holly, now as a heel, soon joined with Heyman and his other associates to feud with Van Dam and others.

On September 26, 2006, Holly received 24 stitches from WWE Doctor Ferdinand Rios in his back after suffering a severe laceration during an Extreme Rules match against Rob Van Dam when he landed on the metal railing of a table he was suplexing Van Dam out of the ring and through during an ECW show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Holly obtained the injury early in the match but continued to wrestle until the match&#x27;s conclusion when he was pinned. After the match, as he was being helped out of the ring, he received a standing ovation from fans. The legitimate incident caused fans to cheer Holly in the following weeks, leading him to become a face character and a feud with Paul Heyman&#x27;s other enforcer Test. His second to latest run as a face was short lived as he eventually turned on Rob Van Dam when they were partners in a tag match.

When Sabu was found kayfabe unconscious in the locker room area before the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember on December 3, Holly was chosen as his replacement. Holly entered with Rob Van Dam as the first of two combatants. He was the second to be eliminated; he was eliminated by Test by a running big boot. Subsequently, he entered into a feud with CM Punk whereby Holly, now a tweener, showed his endurance by surviving Punk&#x27;s Anaconda Vice submission hold. Holly then gave Punk his first loss in ECW; Punk had been undefeated for half a year. After Test replaced Holly in a match against ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley, Holly vowed he would become champion whether he faced Test or Lashley. Holly then was one of the ECW superstars entered in the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2007, but was eliminated by The Great Khali. Holly soon became the number one contender for Lashley&#x27;s ECW World Championship and faced off against Lashley, albeit unsuccessfully.

On the April 3 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Holly lost to Snitsky. After the match, Snitsky wedged Holly&#x27;s arm between the steel steps and repeatedly hit the steps with a steel chair, resulting in a broken arm in the storyline. Holly had surgery on April 16 because of a staph infection and missed around five months.

====Alliance with Cody Rhodes and departure (2007–2009)====

Hardcore Holly was drafted back to SmackDown! from ECW on June 17, 2007, as part of the Supplemental Draft. Despite his draft, Holly would return to in-ring action on the Raw brand by September 24, 2007, defeating the rookie Cody Rhodes. This match initiated a brief &quot;respect&quot; feud between the two, with Holly defeating Rhodes on the next two episodes of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the October 22 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Holly turned into a fan favorite when he saved Rhodes from a post-match assault by Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas. Holly and Rhodes subsequently teamed up and emerged victorious in a tag team match against Benjamin and Haas the following week. Their teamwork led to a title opportunity when they defeated Paul London and Brian Kendrick and The Highlanders in a WWE.com exclusive match, courtesy of Holly&#x27;s Alabama Slam. Holly and Rhodes, however, were unsuccessful in their challenge for the World Tag Team Championship at Survivor Series on November 18 against the reigning champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch.

Despite this setback, on the December 10, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during the brand’s 15th Anniversary show, Holly and Rhodes captured the World Tag Team Championship from Cade and Murdoch. The pair successfully defended their titles on multiple occasions, including matches against teams like Carlito and Santino Marella, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick.

At the Night of Champions event on June 29, 2008, Rhodes turned on Holly, teaming with Ted DiBiase to defeat Holly and claim the World Tag Team Championship. This marked Holly’s final WWE pay-per-view appearance. Following this, Holly took an extended hiatus from WWE television for seven months. He was released from his contract January 16, 2009, after 15 years with the company, ending his lengthy tenure with WWE. 

In the months preceding his release, Holly faced personal struggles, including a suspension due to a pain pill addiction. The incident that led to this suspension involved Holly being caught stealing painkillers from another wrestler’s bag, which resulted in his immediate placement in rehab.

===Independent circuit (2009–2019)===
In May 2009, Holly traveled to England and wrestled for Varsity Pro Wrestling. On May 26, Holly defeated The UK Kid in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match during which he sustained a rib injury. Throughout mid-2009, Holly wrestled for National Wrestling Superstars, competing against wrestlers including Danny Demento, Salvatore Sincere, and D. J. Hyde. Holly then took a break from wrestling from 2010 until 2013.

On March 19, 2013, Holly, now bald and sporting a new tattoo, made a one night appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as he took part in a six-man tag team match and teamed with James Storm and Magnus to defeat Aces &amp; Eights (D.O.C., Wes Brisco, and Knux) at the TNA One Night Only event Hardcore Justice 2, which was aired on July 5, this was Holly&#x27;s only match for TNA. Later that year he would wrestle for Southside Wrestling Entertainment and Preston City Wrestling in the U.K. and for Melbourne City Wrestling in Australia.

On May 7, 2016, Holly wrestled in the Netherlands for Pro Wrestling Showdown. Holly would also spend time in the UK, competing for PCW, Kamikaze Pro, Southside. Holly would also challenge Eddie Ryan for the Pro Wrestling Pride Heavyweight Championship, and Joseph Conners for the ; however he would win neither championship.

Holly participated in a triple threat match against Cody Hall and Luke Hawx for the British WAW promotion on June 2, 2019. Although Holly did not announce a retirement afterwards, the match is his last known to date.

==Auto racing career==
In 1992, Howard began auto racing in Mobile, Alabama at the Mobile International Speedway. Driving a 1974 Chevrolet Malibu, Howard placed fifth in the 1992 season and won the 1993 season.

In 1995, Howard began driving a World Wrestling Federation-sponsored super late model in the All Pro Series in an attempt at cross promotion. After the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) withdrew its sponsorship, WWF chairman Vince McMahon gifted the equipment to Howard.

==Personal life==
Howard has a daughter named Stephanie from his first marriage. In 2009, Howard moved to Dubuque as he reconnected with his high school girlfriend, Linda Kievet. Howard has been married to Kievet since 2010.

Howard&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;The Hardcore Truth: The Bob Holly Story&quot; was released in the United States on April 1, 2013. Co-authored by former British wrestler Ross Owen Williams, an actor and writer who wrestled Holly in June 2010, it was published by ECW Press.

<doc id="993655" wikidata="Q57373" url="?curid=993655" title="Asif Ali Zardari">
<text>Asif Ali Zardari (born 26 July 1955) is a Pakistani politician who became the 14th president of Pakistan on 10 March 2024, having held the same office from 2008 to 2013. He is the president of Pakistan People&#x27;s Party Parliamentarians and was the co-chairperson of Pakistan People&#x27;s Party from December 2007 until December 2015.

He earlier served as the 11th president of Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, the first president born after Independence. He is the widower of twice-elected Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto. He was a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2018 to 2023, and in 2024.

The son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a landowner from Sindh, Zardari rose to prominence after his marriage to Benazir Bhutto in 1987, who became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after her election in 1988. When Bhutto&#x27;s government was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990, Zardari was widely criticized for involvement in corruption scandals that led to its collapse. When Bhutto was reelected in 1993, Zardari served as Federal Investment Minister and Chairperson of Pakistan Environmental Protection Council. There were increasing tensions between Bhutto&#x27;s brother Murtaza and Zardari, and Murtaza was killed by police in Karachi on 20 September 1996. Bhutto&#x27;s government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari, and Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza&#x27;s murder and for corruption.

Although incarcerated, he nominally served in Parliament after being elected to the National Assembly in 1990 and Senate in 1997. He was released from jail in 2004 and went into self-exile to Dubai, but returned when Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007. As the new co-chairman of the PPP, he led his party to victory in the 2008 general elections. He spearheaded a coalition that forced military ruler Pervez Musharraf to resign, and was elected president on 6 September 2008. He was acquitted of various criminal charges the same year.

As president, Zardari remained a strong American ally in the war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the NATO attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP&#x27;s elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt of court in 2012 after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari&#x27;s tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.

Towards the end of his term, Zardari recorded abysmally low approval ratings, ranging from 11 to 14%. After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country&#x27;s first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 9 September 2013. His legacy remains divisive, with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and cronyism. However, he became president of Pakistan again in March 2024 due to a coalition agreement which was reached following the 2024 Pakistani general election.

==Early life and education==
Zardari was born on 26 July 1955 in Karachi, Sindh to a prominent Sindhi-Baloch family, and received his upbringing and education in Karachi. He belongs to the Zardari family and is the only son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a tribal chief and prominent landowner, and Bilquis Sultana Zardari. His paternal grandmother was of Iraqi descent, while his mother was the granddaughter of Hassan Ali Effendi, a Sindhi educationist with Turkish roots who is known as the founder of the Sindh Madressatul Islam.

In his youth, he led a polo team known as the Zardari Four and pracised boxing. His father owned Bambino—a famous cinema in Karachi—and donated movie equipment to his school. He appeared in a 1969 movie, &quot;Salgira&quot;, as a child. Zardari&#x27;s academic background remains a question mark. He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick&#x27;s High School, Karachi from 1973 to 1974; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a bachelor of education degree in the early 1970s. Zardari&#x27;s official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree, but the rule was overturned by Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court in April 2008.

==Career==
===Early political career and Benazir Bhutto era===
Zardari&#x27;s initial political career was unsuccessful. In 1983, he lost an election for a district council seat in Nawabshah, a city of Sindh, where his family owned thousands of acres of farmland. He then went into real estate.

He married Benazir Bhutto on 18 December 1987. The marriage, which had been arranged, as is customary in Pakistan, was initially described as an unlikely match. The lavish sunset ceremony in Karachi was followed by immense night celebrations that included over 100,000 people. The marriage enhanced Bhutto&#x27;s political position in a country where older unmarried women are frowned upon. Zardari deferred to his wife&#x27;s wishes by agreeing to stay out of politics.

In 1988, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq died when his plane exploded in midair. A few months later, Bhutto became Pakistan&#x27;s first female prime minister when her party won 94 of 207 seats contested in the 1988 elections.

===Involvement in the first Bhutto Administration and first imprisonment===
He generally stayed out of his wife&#x27;s first administration, but he and his associates became entangled in corruption cases linked to the government. He was largely blamed for the collapse of the Bhutto administration.

After the dismissal of Bhutto&#x27;s government in August 1990, Benazir Bhutto and Zardari were prohibited from leaving the country by security forces under the direction of the Pakistan Army. During the interim government between August and October, caretaker prime minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a Bhutto rival, initiated investigations of corruption by the Bhutto administration. Jatoi accused Zardari of using his wife&#x27;s political position to charge a ten percent commission for obtaining permission to set up any project or to receive loans. He was tagged with the nickname &quot;Mr. Ten Percent&quot;.

He was arrested on 10 October 1990 on charges relating to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman&#x27;s leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, he was elected to the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari&#x27;s incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court&#x27;s power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto&#x27;s first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.

On 25 March 1991, the hijackers aboard Singapore Airlines Flight 117 demanded Zardari&#x27;s release among other demands. The hijackers were killed by Singapore Commandos.

===Political involvement in the second Bhutto Administration===
In April 1993, he became one of the 18 cabinet ministers in the caretaker government that succeeded Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s first abridged premiership. The caretaker government lasted until the July elections. After Bhutto&#x27;s election, he served as her Investment Minister, chief of the intelligence bureau, and the head of the Federal Investigation Agency. In February 1994, Benazir sent Zardari to meet with Saddam Hussein in Iraq to deliver medicine in exchange for three detained Pakistanis arrested on the ambiguous Kuwait-Iraq border. In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as &quot;de-facto Prime Minister&quot;. In March 1995, he was appointed chairman of the new Environment Protection Council.

During the beginning of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat&#x27;s son and Benazir&#x27;s younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war. At Murtaza&#x27;s funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible and vowed to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza&#x27;s widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza&#x27;s death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari&#x27;s involvement. Several of Pakistan&#x27;s leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza&#x27;s activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.

In November 1996, Bhutto&#x27;s government was dismissed by Leghari primarily because of corruption and Murtaza&#x27;s death. Zardari was arrested in Lahore while attempting to flee the country to Dubai.

==Jail and exile==

===&quot;The New York Times&quot; report===
A major report was published in January 1998 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailing Zardari&#x27;s vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer in return for a monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari&#x27;s mid-1990s spending spree, which included hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.

Citibank, already under fire for its private-banking practices, got into further trouble as a result of the report. Zardari&#x27;s financial history was one case study in a 1999 U.S. Senate report on vulnerabilities in banking procedures.

===Second imprisonment and conviction===
In March 1997, Zardari was elected to the Senate while in a Karachi jail. In December 1997, he was flown to Islamabad under tight security to take his oath.

In July 1998, he was indicted for corruption in Pakistan after the Swiss government handed over documents to Pakistani authorities relating to money laundering. The Swiss had also indicted him for money laundering. At the same time, in a separate case, he and 18 others were indicted for conspiracy to murder Murtaza Bhutto. After criminal prosecutions began, Citibank closed Zardari&#x27;s account.

In April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari were convicted for receiving indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection company that was hired to end corruption in the collection of customs duties. The couple received a fine of $8.6 million. Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self-imposed exile. Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges. The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability.

In May 1999, he was hospitalised after an alleged attempted suicide. He claimed it was a murder attempt by the police.

In August 2003, a Swiss judge convicted Bhutto and Zardari of money laundering and sentenced them to six months imprisonment and a fine of $50,000. In addition, they were required to return $11 million to the Pakistani government. The conviction involved charges relating to kickbacks from two Swiss firms in exchange for customs fraud. In France, Poland, and Switzerland, the couple faced additional allegations.

In November 2004, he was released on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing to show up for a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he was released on $5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release again was regarded as a sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf&#x27;s government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai.

===Exile and legal problems===
He returned to Lahore in April 2005. Police prevented him from holding rallies by escorting him from the airport to his home. He criticised Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s government, but rumours of reconciliation between Musharraf and the PPP grew. Zardari went back to Dubai in May 2005.

In June 2005, he had a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States. In September 2005, he did not show up for a Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges; the court issued an arrest warrant. His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple&#x27;s extradition.

When Bhutto announced in September 2007 her upcoming return to Pakistan, her husband was in New York City undergoing medical treatment. After the October 2007 bombing in Karachi that tainted Bhutto&#x27;s return, he accused Pakistani intelligence services of being behind the attacks and claimed &quot;it was not done by militants&quot;. He had not accompanied Bhutto, staying in Dubai with their daughters. Bhutto called for the removal of the chief investigator of the attacks because she claimed he had been involved in Zardari&#x27;s alleged torture in prison in 1999.

In November 2007, Musharraf instituted emergency rule for six weeks (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, a few days after Bhutto&#x27;s departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf&#x27;s U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Pervez Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.

In the midst of his exile, Zardari had several different legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, he would have had to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.

In exile, he shifted between homes in New York, London, and Dubai, where his three children lived.

On the night of 27 December 2007, he returned to Pakistan following his wife&#x27;s assassination.

==Co-chairperson of the PPP==

===Bhutto&#x27;s assassination and succession===

Zardari prevented Bhutto&#x27;s autopsy in accordance with Islamic principles. He and their children attended her funeral, which was held the next day. He denied government allegations that the assassination was sponsored by Al-Qaida. He called for an international inquiry into her death and stated that she would still be alive if Musharraf&#x27;s government had provided adequate protection. He and his family offered to accept Musharraf&#x27;s demand to exhume Bhutto&#x27;s body in exchange for a United Nations inquiry, but Musharraf rejected the proposal.

In Bhutto&#x27;s political will, she had designated Zardari her successor as party leader. However, their nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, became Chairman of the PPP because Zardari favoured Bilawal to represent Bhutto&#x27;s legacy, in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity. He did, however, serve as co-chairman of the PPP for at least three years until Bilawal completed his studies overseas.

===February parliamentary elections and coalition formation===

Zardari called for no delays to the 8 January parliamentary elections and for the participation of all opposition parties. Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott. Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February. In January 2008, he suggested that if his party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf&#x27;s Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q). He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party (PML-N), threatened national protests if any vote-rigging was attempted. He himself could not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive.

The PPP and the PML-N won the largest and second largest number of seats respectively in the February elections. He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power-sharing deal between him and Musharraf. They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, he reached out to Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections.

After weeks of speculation and party infighting, he said he did not want to become prime minister. In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for prime minister in a snub to the more politically powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim.

===2008 coalition government===

He and Sharif agreed in a 9 March 2008 agreement, known as the Murree Declaration, to the reinstatement by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf. The deadline was later extended to 12 May. He and Sharif held unsuccessful talks at London in May. After the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, the PML-N withdrew from the government in mid-May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet. The coalition regrouped, again with the PML-N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove the power of the President to dismiss Parliament. By late May, the coalition was set in a confrontation with Musharraf. At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth.

He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 to discuss Musharraf&#x27;s removal and the constitutional amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going far enough to fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition did not have the two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies—National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.

In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the coalition agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf&#x27;s impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and the coalition selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned in order to avoid impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance on the future of the judiciary.

===Rise to presidency===

Presidential elections were held within three weeks after the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected president on 6 September 2008.

==First term as President (2008–2013)==
=== Initial days ===
At the inauguration on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was a guest of honour, which was a signal for much closer cooperation between the two nations in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President&#x27;s power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as president.

=== United Nations visit ===

From 23 to 26 September 2008, he met with various foreign leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao. He suffered political embarrassment by flirting with U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and making tongue-in-cheek comments about her. Although, at the United Nations General Assembly, he publicly condemned U.S drone attacks in Pakistan, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that he had signed a &quot;secret deal&quot; when he met with senior American officials that arranged for the coordination of Predator strikes and a jointly approved list of prominent targets. He and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to resume peace talks by the end of 2008.

===Economic crises===

From 14 to 17 October 2008, he was in China to negotiate foreign aid, as Pakistan faced the possibility of defaulting on its payments. China refused to offer any aid commitments, but instead promised to provide assistance in the development of two nuclear power plants and more future business investments.

After Saudi Arabia, Britain, China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates refused to provide any bailout, he officially asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance in solving Pakistan&#x27;s balance of payments problem on 22 October.

He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November in hopes of obtaining financial aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies as part of a broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.

In mid-November 2008, Zardari&#x27;s government officially sent a letter of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008–10. The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010–11 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.

In January 2011, the MQM withdrew from the government. Zardari&#x27;s ruling coalition averted a government collapse by accepting the opposition&#x27;s economic proposals, which restored gas subsidies and abandoned many of the IMF&#x27;s suggested reforms.

In an effort to curb government expenditures, Zardari swore in an &quot;austerity cabinet&quot; in February 2011 which reduced the cabinet from 60 ministers to 22. Asif Zardari is famously known as &quot;Mr. Ten (10) percent&quot; in the Pakistan&#x27;s political landscape, as he is alleged to demand 10% as kickbacks for the government contracts.

===Foreign policy===

====Relationship with India====

In early October 2008, he received fierce domestic criticism for repeatedly calling Kashmiri nationalists (see Kashmir conflict) in India &quot;terrorists&quot;. In mid-November 2008, he suggested Pakistan was ready for a no-first-use nuclear policy and called for closer economic ties.

The relationship between the two nations was damaged by the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He initially denied any links between the perpetrators and Pakistan, but the government soon pursued military action against Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders in a 7 December raid. India cleared Zardari&#x27;s government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them. Zardari offered to send Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha to assist in the investigation.

In June 2009, Zardari met Singh for the first time since the Mumbai attacks at a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia.

On 8 April 2012, President Zardari, along with his son Bilawal Zardari Bhutto, visited Dargah Sharif in Ajmer, India on a private visit. He also met with the Indian prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh.

==== War in Afghanistan ====

The government has had a longstanding conflict in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan. Diplomatic relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai improved after Musharraf&#x27;s departure and Zardari&#x27;s rise to power. The Obama administration&#x27;s AfPak policy, through AfPak envoy Richard Holbrooke, reflected the unified approach the United States took in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In his first visit to Afghanistan as president in early January 2009, Zardari promised a renewed relationship to improve cooperation. In late March, Obama announced a civilian aid package of $7.5 billion over five years in return for cooperation in the AfPak conflict. In late April, British prime minister Gordon Brown visited Zardari and promised $1 billion over the next four years. In May, Obama held a trilateral summit in Washington D.C., with Karzai and Zardari, where they discussed further cooperation. At Brussels in mid-June, Zardari unsuccessfully sought trade concessions from the European Union; it instead pledged $90 million development aid to curtail tribal influence by insurgents. After the U.S. Congress passed Obama&#x27;s civilian aid package in October, army generals in the Pakistani military establishment widened the growing rift with Zardari&#x27;s government and openly criticised U.S. interference.

In February 2009, FATA&#x27;s provincial government officially declared Islamic law in Swat to achieve a ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.

In September 2010, Zardari and Karzai met in Islamabad and both advocated fighting insurgents rather than trying to end the war with diplomacy. Zardari went to the United States in January 2011 to attend Special Envoy Holbrooke&#x27;s funeral. Following Osama bin Laden&#x27;s death in a compound in Abbottabad in May 2011, Obama called Zardari and collaborated on the events.

===Reinstatement of the judiciary===

In February 2009, Zardari and the Musharraf-appointed Supreme Court attempted to disqualify Nawaz Sharif from running in any elections and tried to force his brother Shahbaz Sharif to resign as Chief Minister of Punjab province. Zardari dismissed the Punjab provincial government and only partially reinstated the judiciary by restoring 56 other judges deposed by Musharraf—but not their former leader, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. After Nawaz Sharif defied house arrest and rallied with thousands of his supporters, the Sharif brothers vowed to join forces with the Lawyers&#x27; Movement in the &quot;Long March&quot;. Zardari&#x27;s government gave in to popular pressure and Prime Minister Gilani in an early morning speech on 16 March 2009 promised to reinstate Chaudhry by 21 March. Ten judges were reinstated on 16 March, and Chaudry assumed his position on 22 March. Zardari&#x27;s month-long direct control of the Punjab ended on 30 March.

===Nizam-e-Adl Regulation===
In April 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari signed the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation into law. The regulation formally established Sharia law in the Malakand division.

===Reduction of presidential powers===

In late November 2009, Zardari ceded to Prime Minister Gillani the chairmanship of the National Command Authority, Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenal oversight agency.

In December 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which cleared the way for the revival of corruption cases against Zardari. Although Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was president, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan&#x27;s government to reopen Zardari&#x27;s corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.

In February 2010, Zardari sparked a standoff by attempting to appoint a Supreme Court candidate without the court&#x27;s approval, but the confrontation ended after he backed down and nominated a candidate acceptable by the court.

In April 2010, after months of political pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the office of the power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as prime minister, which enabled Zardari&#x27;s foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari&#x27;s main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.

In late September 2010, the Supreme Court considered removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry met with his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari&#x27;s government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening the power of the Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.

In March 2011, Zardari delivered his annual parliamentary address to a half-empty chamber because of an opposition walkout.

In November 2012, the Pakistan government in response to the court orders, finally wrote to the Swiss authorities seeking to reopen the corruption cases against Zardari. The Swiss government responded by saying that the corruption cases being time-barred cannot be reopened.

===2010 Pakistan floods and Europe tour===
The 2010 Pakistan floods began in late July with rain in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and soon submerged a fifth of Pakistan and affected 20 million people, resulting in one of the nation&#x27;s largest natural catastrophes. Simultaneously, British prime minister David Cameron sparked a serious diplomatic row with Pakistan during his visit to India by stating that elements within Pakistan were promoting the &quot;export of terror&quot; a week before a planned visit by Zardari to Britain. Zardari ignored domestic pressure and began his European trip in Paris on 1 August, meeting French President Sarkozy. In France, he drew a rebuke from the U.S. after stating that NATO had &quot;lost the battle for hearts and minds&quot; in the Afghan war. As the flood&#x27;s devastation became increasingly evident, he was widely criticised for flying in a helicopter to his Normandy chateau and dining at Cameron&#x27;s Chequers countryside home. Protests within Britain, mainly among the British Pakistani community, grew against his visit. The widely expected maiden speech by his son Bilawal was cancelled, as Zardari faced criticism for using the trip to advance Bilawal&#x27;s political aspirations.

Zardari returned to Pakistan on 10 August. He first visit to an area affected by the flooding was in Sukkur on 12 August. He cancelled the 14 August Independence Day celebrations and instead visited Naushera. He flew over devastated areas with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 15 August. He left the country on 18 August and attended the four-way Russian summit at Sochi, which included Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On 19 August, he visited Jampur with U.S. Senator John Kerry. He ordered local authorities to concentrate efforts to save Shahdadkot from inundation on 24 August.

===2011 Dubai hospitalisation===
In early December 2011 Zardari flew to Dubai undergoing medical tests and treatment, reportedly for a &quot;small stroke&quot;. According to the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, Zardari sought medical treatment outside of Pakistan because of &quot;threats to his life&quot;. He finds himself currently in the midst of the &quot;Memogate&quot; controversy. Zardari left the hospital on 14 December to recuperate at the Persian Gulf, while his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, assumed a more prominent role in Pakistan.
By 19 December, Zardari had returned to Pakistan.

=== China–Pakistan Economic Corridor ===
Pakistan and China on 22 May 2013 signed several agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) that mainly included the long-term China–Pakistan Economic Corridor plan, maritime cooperation and satellite navigation. President Zardari and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang witnessed the signing ceremony as the representatives of the two countries inked the documents at a ceremony held at the Aiwan-e-Sadr. The visit of Premier Keqiang marked the signing of important documents aimed at long-term cooperation between the two countries in multiple areas.

===Completion of first presidential tenure===
Zardari completed his five-year term on 8 September 2013, becoming the first democratically elected president in the 66-year-long history of Pakistan to complete his tenure. He received a guard of honour while leaving the Aiwan-e-Sadr. He was succeeded by Mamnoon Hussain as president.

==Between first and second term==
He became active in the PPP, which he voted to revamp, after his presidency. He succeeded Ameen Faheem as chairman of PPPP in 2015. In December 2016, he announced that both he and his son Bilawal, would contest the 2018 general election.

In July 2017, during the investigation of the Panama Papers case, Zardari demanded Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s resignation. In August 2017, Pakistan&#x27;s anti-corruption court acquitted him from his last pending case in which he was accused along with his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, of laundering illegal kickbacks and maintaining assets beyond known sources of income. The case had dogged him for 19 years. His rival Imran Khan believed that Zardari&#x27;s acquittal was the result of a deal between the PML-N and PPP. However he denied any kind of collaboration. The National Accountability Bureau also challenged the acquittal. On 2 September, after his wife&#x27;s murder case verdict, which declared Pervez Musharraf a fugitive and convicted two senior police officers, he said that he was not satisfied with the verdict and that he would appeal the judgment as it had acquitted five Pakistani Taliban suspects. In 2019, he was arrested in Islamabad over a money laundering case. An anti-graft court issued an indictment of Zardari on corruption charges on 10 August 2020.

==Second term as President (since 2024)==
On 3 March 2024, the Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan confirmed that the Pakistani Parliament would meet on 9 March 2024 to elect a new President of Pakistan, which Zardari won with 411 votes from the national and provincial assemblies against Mahmood Khan Achakzai. He was elected as President on 9 March 2024 by securing 411 electoral votes and his opponent Mahmood Khan Achakzai secured 181 electoral votes. He was sworn in as 14th President on 10 March 2024, the first civilian to be elected as President for a second non-consecutive term.

===Opposition reaction===
Omar Ayub Khan, the opposition leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan, called Zardari &#x27;illegal&#x27;. PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan described his election &quot;unconstitutional and unacceptable.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Family===
Zardari and Benazir Bhutto had one son and two daughters. His son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, is the current Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. His older daughter, Bakhtawar, was born on 25 January 1990, and his younger daughter, Aseefa, was born on 3 February 1993. After Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s death, his sister Faryal Talpur became the guardian of his children and he changed Bilawal Zardari&#x27;s name to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

His mother died in November 2002, during his detention in jail. His father Hakim Ali Zardari died in May 2011. After that he became the chieftain of the Zardari tribe. However, initially he had decided not to assume leadership and wanted to pass the position to his son Bilawal.

===Spirituality===

Zardari is known to seek the advice of &quot;soothsayers and healers&quot;, especially during times of political troubles. He has visited Prof. Ahmad Rafique Akhtar, a well-known Sufi scholar based in Gujar Khan who often counsels government officials and military leaders. During his presidency, he would consult with his then spiritual leader, Pir Mohammad Ejaz, about such matters as travel times and animals were sacrificed during particularly trying periods.

===Health===
His mental health has been a subject of controversy. He has repeatedly claimed he was tortured while in prison. He was diagnosed with dementia, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder from 2005 to 2007, which helped influence the verdict of one of his corruption trials. He now claims he is completely healthy, with only high blood pressure and diabetes.

===Wealth===
In 2005, &quot;Daily Pakistan&quot; reported he was the second richest man in Pakistan, with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion. He amassed great wealth while his wife was prime minister. In 2007, he received US$60 million into his Swiss bank account through offshore companies under his name. He was reported to have estates in Surrey, West End of London, Manhattan (a condominium in Belaire Apartments), and Dubai, and a 16th-century chateau in Normandy. In Britain, he used a common legal device, the purchase of property through nominees with no family link to the Bhuttos. His homes in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad are called Bilawal House I, Bilawal House II, and Zardari House respectively.

===Surrey estate===
He bought a 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through a chain of firms, trusts, and offshore companies in 1994. The country home&#x27;s refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly before the end of his wife&#x27;s second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property, and the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion were not paid. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004, and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continued.

The estate includes two farms, lodgings, staff accommodation, and a basement made into an imitation of a local pub. The manor has nine bedrooms and an indoor swimming pool.

He had sent large shipments from Karachi in the 1990s for the refurbishment of Surrey Palace. He has faced allegations from various people, including the daughter of Laila Shahzada, that he acquired stolen art to decorate the palace. He earlier had plans for a helipad, a nine-hole golf course, and a polo pony paddock.

<text>The European Gendarmerie Force (EUROGENDFOR) is a European rapid reaction force composed of elements of several European police and gendarmerie forces. EUROGENDFOR is tasked with performing policing tasks within the scope of crisis management operations.

It was launched by an agreement in 2006 between five member states of the European Union (EU): France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Romania joined in 2009; Poland in 2011. Its status is enshrined in the Treaty of Velsen of 18 October 2007. The headquarters are located in Vicenza, Italy.

It is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP); it is for instance not a project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) of the CSDP. It may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a &quot;multinational force&quot; in accordance with article 42.3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

==History==
The French Defence Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie first proposed the force in September 2003. Alliot-Marie and the Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino presented the idea at the Meeting of European Union Defense Ministers in October 2003. The implementation agreement was finally signed by defence ministers of the five participating countries on 17 September 2004 in Noordwijk, Netherlands. On 23 January 2006, the EGF was officially inaugurated during a military ceremony in the Gen. Chinotto barracks in Vicenza.

EUROGENDFOR was declared fully operational on 20 July 2006, following the High Level Interministerial meeting in Madrid, Spain, and its second successful Command Post exercise (CPX), which took place between 19 and 28 April 2006. The first CPX was held at the National Gendarmerie Training Center in Saint Astier, France in June 2005.

After Romania&#x27;s accession to the European Union, the Romanian Gendarmerie sought permanent observer status with the European Gendarmerie Force, as a first step towards full membership. On March 3, 2009, the Romanian Gendarmerie became a full member of the European Gendarmerie Force.

The Polish Military Gendarmerie was originally a partner force and, on 10 October 2006, Poland indicated it would like to join the EGF. In December 2011, Poland applied for full membership in EGF, which was granted in 2011.

==Missions==

Since December 2009, the EGF has taken part in the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) training operation of the Afghan National Police (ANP) in the War in Afghanistan. As of June 2010, 276 members of the EGF (among which 124 French gendarmes), from France, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Portugal are training the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) officers and non-commissioned officers, while the initial mission was planned to be around 400 to 500 men. They are training them in ANCOP training centers but are also accompanying, advising and helping them during their missions in P-OMLT (Police Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams), where their military experience (even if the mission is strictly speaking, civilian) will be useful. As of May 2010, it had trained 50 officers and 250 non-commissioned officers of the ANCOP, and the then French Minister of Defense Brice Hortefeux announced that 40 more French gendarmes would be sent to help this mission.

In early 2010, the EGF was deployed to Haiti to help with post-relief security efforts.

==Relationship with EU defence policy==
The EGF has been widely misrepresented, notably with regard to its general purpose and specific relationship to the EU. The EGF is not an EU body, and has no power to intervene on the soil of the EU and its Member States, including the EGF countries.

The EGF is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP); it is for instance not a project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) of the CSDP. The EGF may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a &quot;multinational force&quot; in accordance with article 42.3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

==Structure==

EUROGENDFOR is based in Vicenza, in northeastern Italy, and has a core of 800 to 900 members ready to deploy within 30 days.

An additional 2,300 reinforcements are available on standby.

===Commanders===
==Members==
The treaty allows for any EU member state to become a European Gendarmerie Force member state, subject to the approval of existing European Gendarmerie Force members. The member forces are:
Germany does not take part, as its constitution does not permit the use of military forces for police services. In 2004, Peter Struck, Minister of Defense at the time, clarified that the legal foundation for militarised police forces is different from the expectations underlying the EGF. The paramilitary Bereitschaftspolizei units of the Länder states have no standing patrol order like the German Federal Police. Germany did not sign the Treaty of Velsen on the EGF or any subsequent accord. Instead, there is a tight integration of police forces based on the Prüm Treaty. Originally the Prüm Treaty regulated access to police databases of neighboring countries but it was used multiple times as the legal foundation to exchange riot police equipment and personnel with the participating countries (Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium). In 2008 the Prüm Treaty was naturalised as EU law, allowing countries access to police forces regulated under EU law (based on the Schengen Agreement). The European Police Forces Training of 2009 (EUPFT 2009) was run in Vicenza (home of EGF headquarters) and the EUPFT 2010 on anti-riot tactics was run in Lehnin in Germany.

<doc id="993666" wikidata="Q4869642" url="?curid=993666" title="Batson v. Kentucky">
<text>Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court ruling that a prosecutor&#x27;s use of a peremptory challenge in a criminal case—the dismissal of jurors without stating a valid cause for doing so—may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race. The Court ruled that this practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case gave rise to the term &quot;Batson challenge&quot;, an objection to a peremptory challenge based on the standard established by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in this case. Subsequent jurisprudence has resulted in the extension of &quot;Batson&quot; to civil cases (&quot;Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company&quot;) and cases where jurors are excluded on the basis of sex (&quot;J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.&quot;).

The principle had been established previously by several state courts, including the California Supreme Court in 1978, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1979, and the Florida Supreme Court in 1984.

==Background==
James Kirkland Batson was an African American man convicted of burglary and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court by a jury composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal was based on the jury selection, or &quot;voir dire&quot;, phase of the trial. During this phase, potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During &quot;voir dire&quot; the judge can dismiss jurors, and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.

In this case, the judge dismissed several potential jurors for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors and the prosecutor, Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black potential jurors, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury on the ground that the prosecutor&#x27;s removal of black people from the jury pool violated petitioner&#x27;s rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner&#x27;s request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.

The defendant appealed his conviction to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which affirmed the conviction. That court cited &quot;Swain v. Alabama&quot;, and held that a defendant alleging lack of a fair cross section must demonstrate systematic exclusion of a group of jurors from the panel of prospective jurors. That is, the defendant had to show that not just in his case, but as a process, juries in his community were being constructed so as to not represent a cross section of that community. Batson continued his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted &quot;certiorari&quot; to decide whether petitioner was tried &quot;in violation of constitutional provisions guaranteeing the defendant an impartial jury and a jury composed of persons representing a fair cross section of the community.&quot;

==The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision==
In a 7–2 decision authored by Justice Lewis Powell, the Supreme Court ruled in Batson&#x27;s favor. The court overruled &quot;Swain v. Alabama&quot; by lowering the burden of proof that a defendant must meet to make a &quot;prima facie&quot; case of purposeful discrimination. In &quot;Swain&quot;, the Court had recognized that a &quot;State&#x27;s purposeful or deliberate denial to Negroes on account of race of participation as jurors in the administration of justice violates the Equal Protection Clause&quot;, but that the defendant had the burden of proving a systematic striking of black jurors throughout the county, that is, that the peremptory challenge system as a whole was being perverted. In &quot;Batson&quot; the court ruled that the defendant could make a &quot;prima facie&quot; case for purposeful racial discrimination in jury selection by relying on the record only in his own case. The Court explained:

The Court also held that:

* A State denies a black defendant equal protection when it puts him on trial before a jury from which members of his race have been purposely excluded
* A defendant has no right to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race. However, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the defendant that the State will not exclude members of his race from the jury venire on account of race, or on the false assumption that members of his race as a group are not qualified to serve as jurors
* The peremptory challenge occupies an important position in trial procedures

Justice Marshall, concurring with the majority, called the decision &quot;historic&quot; but added: &quot;The decision today will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury-selection process. That goal can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.&quot;

In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger argued that the court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Batson&quot; &quot;sets aside the peremptory challenge, a procedure which has been part of the common law for many centuries and part of our jury system for nearly 200 years&quot;. He believed the majority was replacing peremptory challenges with something very similar to challenge for cause, but was unclear in explaining the standard to be applied. &quot;I am at a loss to discern the governing principles here&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I join my colleagues in wishing the nation&#x27;s judges well as they struggle to grasp how to implement today&#x27;s holding.&quot;

Justice Rehnquist wrote that the majority misapplied equal protection doctrine: &quot;In my view, there is simply nothing &#x27;unequal&#x27; about the state using its peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the jury in cases involving black defendants, so long as such challenges are also used to exclude whites in cases involving white defendants, Hispanics in cases involving Hispanic defendants, Asians in cases involving Asian defendants, and so on.&quot;

===Impact===
Whether the principles of &quot;Batson&quot; applied retroactively to anyone convicted previously by juries whose racial composition was influenced by peremptory challenges not consistent with this opinion was for a time uncertain. In &quot;Allen v. Hardy&quot; (1986), the Court held that it did not apply retroactively to collateral review of final convictions. In &quot;Griffith v. Kentucky&quot; (1987), it decided it would apply it in cases on direct review.

==Batson challenge==
The term &quot;Batson&quot; challenge describes an objection to opposing counsel&#x27;s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror from the jury pool based on criteria the courts have found disqualifying, as race was the sole rationale for exclusion in &quot;Batson&quot;.

In some cases, parties have appealed a verdict or judgment and asked it be invalidated because one or more peremptory challenges excluded a cognizable group from the jury. Although the &quot;Batson&quot; decision addressed jury selection in criminal trials, in 1991 the Supreme Court later extended the same rule to civil trials in &quot;Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company&quot;. In 1994, in &quot;J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.&quot;, the Court held that peremptory challenges based on sex alone violated the standard established in &quot;Batson&quot; as well.

The authority of &quot;Batson&quot; was reinforced by a pair of 2005 decisions, &quot;Miller-El v. Dretke&quot; and &quot;Johnson v. California&quot;. The first expanded the evidence that can be considered when establishing that a peremptory challenge was based solely on objectionable criteria. The second addressed the standard of proof by which a Batson challenge should be assessed, finding that it was sufficient to require &quot;an inference&quot; that discrimination was the basis for a peremptory challenge rather than proof that discrimination was &quot;more likely than not&quot; its basis.

&quot;Batson&quot; has been applied to the discriminatory use of peremptory strikes against judges in a California case, &quot;Superior Court v. Williams&quot;. Defense counsel objected to the prosecution&#x27;s motion to disqualify an African-American judge, suspecting that the motion was racially motivated. The Court noted that use of Equal Protection in &quot;Batson&quot; to combat racially discriminatory strikes against jurors was well established and that subsequent decisions had extended these protections in other contexts. The Court held that &quot;these principles are equally applicable to race-based challenges to judges.&quot;

===&quot;U.S. v. Blaylock&quot;===
An attempt to extend &quot;Batson&quot; to cover challenges based on sexual orientation failed in 2005. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a defendant&#x27;s criminal appeal in &quot;U.S. v. Blaylock&quot;, because it found the prosecution had &quot;offered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for striking the panel member&quot;. The court did not consider whether the &quot;Batson&quot; challenge rule applied, but its opinion expressed doubt that it did.

===&quot;SmithKline v. Abbott&quot; ===
Extending &quot;Batson&quot; to cover challenges based on sexual orientation was revisited again in 2012, this time in a civil case. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the issue in &quot;SmithKline Beecham Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories&quot;: It ruled unanimously in a landmark decision on January 21, 2014, that, based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, distinctions based on sexual orientation are subject to the &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; standard of review and that &quot;equal protection prohibits peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation&quot;. Defendant Abbott Laboratories decided not to appeal further. However, at least one circuit judge &quot;sua sponte&quot; called for rehearing en banc, and on March 27 the court asked both parties to file briefs on the question. On June 24, the judges of the Ninth Circuit voted not to rehear the case en banc.

==Case participants after &quot;Batson&quot;==
When the Supreme Court reversed his conviction, Batson was serving a twenty-year sentence. Rather than risk a retrial, he pleaded guilty to burglary and received a five-year prison sentence. After his release, Batson was convicted of several offenses including burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, and persistent-felony convictions. He was released from prison again in January 2003 and remains on parole through 2026. Since his release, he worked as a construction worker and later said of the media attention the case received: &quot;It&#x27;s so old, they ought to let it go&quot;.

Joe Gutmann, the prosecutor in Batson&#x27;s 1982 trial, said he had removed the black members of the venire not because of their race, but because they were young and might sympathize with Batson. He later stated that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision was &quot;a good one&quot; because it prevents lawyers from discriminating in jury selection. He left the prosecutor&#x27;s office in 2001 and, since then, taught government and history at the predominantly black, inner-city Louisville Central High School.

Batson and Gutmann later met while Batson was distributing a book he had written trying to discourage youth from crime. The two reconciled and have since become good friends.

<doc id="993669" wikidata="Q241681" url="?curid=993669" title="Rebecca Gayheart">
<text>Rebecca Gayheart (born August 12, 1971) is an American actress and model. Gayheart began her career as a teen model in the 1980s, then advertising spokeswoman and subsequently appeared in a student short film by Brett Ratner, with whom she had an extensive relationship.

== Early life==
Gayheart was born on August 12, 1971, in Hazard, Kentucky, the third of four children born to Floneva &quot;Flo&quot; Gayheart (née Slone), who worked as a Mary Kay independent beauty consultant, and Curtis Gayheart, a miner and coal-truck driver. She has two sisters, Elizabeth and Rachel, and one brother, Curtis Wayne Gayheart. She is of German, English, Scottish and Scots-Irish descent. Gayheart spent her early life in Pine Top, Kentucky. In her first year of high school, she starred in a stage play chronicling the life of Lizzie Borden, in which she played the titular Borden.

At age 15, Gayheart won a local modeling contest, after which she relocated to New York City. There, she completed her high school education at the Professional Children&#x27;s School and went on to attend the actors&#x27; conservatory of the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Meanwhile, Gayheart earned a living appearing in commercials for Campbell&#x27;s soup and Burger King, and also modeled for J. C. Penney catalogues.

==Career==
In the early 1990s, Gayheart signed a contract with Noxzema and became a spokesperson for the company. On television, she had a starring role on the series &quot;Earth 2&quot; (1994–1995) and was a recurring guest star on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1995). She made her feature film debut in the comedy &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; (1997) and then had a lead role in the slasher film &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998). She subsequently starred in the black comedy film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; (1999), followed by supporting roles in the thriller &quot;Shadow Hours&quot; (2000) and the independent comedy &quot;Harvard Man&quot; (2001).

She returned to acting years later, appearing in recurring guest roles on the television series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; (2003), &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2004–2006), and &quot;Vanished&quot; (2006). In 2005, Gayheart made her Broadway debut in a production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. She returned to Broadway again in a 2008 production of &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot;, opposite Mark Rylance and Christine Baranski. Gayheart&#x27;s most recent screen credit is a minor supporting role in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019).

In her first film role, Gayheart appeared in Brett Ratner&#x27;s New York University short film &quot;Whatever Happened to Mason Reese?&quot; (1990) starring Mason Reese. She also appeared in the Ratner-directed music video &quot;Nuttin&#x27; But Love&quot; performed by Heavy D and the Boyz.

Gayheart&#x27;s break into the television industry was a series of television commercials for Noxzema in the early 1990s, earning her the moniker &quot;The Noxzema Girl&quot;. The commercials began airing in 1991 and brought her national recognition. In 1992, Gayheart was cast in her first major role on the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot; as Hannah Mayberry. In 1993 and 1994, she had a recurring role in the &quot;Vanishing Son&quot; action series as cellist Clair Rutledge, the love interest of Russell Wong&#x27;s main character, Jian-Wa Chang. In 1994 and 1995, Gayheart played Bess Martin in the science-fiction series &quot;Earth 2&quot;. In 1995, she played Antonia Marchette, a recurring character in the series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and Luke Perry&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest; the character was killed off after a 10-episode storyline. She was subsequently cast in her feature film debut in the comedy &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; (1997) opposite Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence, portraying a flower shop employee who nearly woos an advertising executive (Robbins). The same year, she had a minor role as a sorority sister in Wes Craven&#x27;s horror film &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997).

After completing &quot;Scream 2&quot;, Gayheart was cast in a lead role in the slasher film &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), in which she portrayed the best friend of a college student (Alicia Witt) who suspects their friends are being murdered according to urban legends. The same year, she appeared onstage at Toronto&#x27;s Canon Theatre in a production of &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo&quot;, opposite Rhea Perlman and Perrey Reeves. In 1999, Gayheart starred in the black comedy film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; with Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, and Judy Greer as girls in an exclusive clique in their high school who inadvertently kill their friend. Though the film was a box-office failure, it went on to earn a cult following in subsequent decades.

Gayheart starred as the waitress in the Train music video for the 1999 song &quot;Meet Virginia&quot;.

In 2000, Gayheart had a lead role in the vampire film &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, as well as a lead role in the thriller &quot;Shadow Hours&quot;, opposite Balthazar Getty. She also had a cameo appearance in &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Urban Legend&quot;.

In 2002, Gayheart was hired for the role of Inara Serra on the television series &quot;Firefly&quot; but was fired after only one day of filming. Show creator Joss Whedon said that a lack of chemistry existed between the rest of the cast and her. The role was recast with actress Morena Baccarin, who reportedly filmed her first scene the day she was accepted for the role. None of Gayheart&#x27;s work was used.

From March to July 2005, Gayheart starred in a Broadway production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance, writing: &quot;Exuding all the breezy confidence of a girl who&#x27;s always been popular and pretty, Gayheart&#x27;s Shelby provides a strong center, allowing only brief glimpses of the cracks in her cheerful, optimistic veneer and refusing to be treated as fragile goods by the clucking women around her.&quot; She also appeared in a minor role in the Christmas horror-comedy film &quot;Santa&#x27;s Slay&quot; (2005). In 2007, Gayheart guest-starred on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; as Jordan, an ex-girlfriend of Alexis Meade. The following year, she returned to Broadway in a revival of the comedy &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot; opposite Christine Baranski, Mark Rylance, Greg Germann, Paige Davis, and Missi Pyle. She had a guest role on &quot;The Cleaner&quot; in 2009.

Gayheart returned to film in 2013, reuniting with &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; director Darren Stein for his comedy &quot;G.B.F.&quot;, portraying the mother of a gay teenage boy. She also starred opposite her husband, Dane, in the 2017-released thriller film &quot;Grey Lady&quot;, which was filmed in 2014.

In 2019, Gayheart returned to film with a minor supporting role in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, playing Billie Booth, the wife of Brad Pitt&#x27;s character.

==Personal life==
Gayheart met Brett Ratner at age 15 on the day she moved to New York City in 1986, and the two carried on a romantic relationship that spanned 13 years. She and Ratner were engaged in 1997, but the couple eventually separated in 1999. Gayheart married actor Eric Dane on October 29, 2004, in Las Vegas. Dane told &quot;Flaunt&quot; magazine about how they met: &quot;It&#x27;s probably one of the least interesting stories in the world. It went basically like this: &#x27;You wanna go out?&#x27; &#x27;Yeah, sure.&#x27; Ten months later, we were married.&quot;

On August 17, 2009, a nude video was posted on the website gawker.com that showed former Miss Teen USA contestant Kari Ann Peniche with Gayheart and husband Eric Dane.
On March 3, 2010, Gayheart gave birth to her first child with Dane, a daughter in Los Angeles. The following year, she gave birth to her second daughter with Dane on December 28, 2011.

In February 2018, Gayheart filed for divorce from Dane after 14 years of marriage, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot;

==Legal issues==
On June 13, 2001, while driving a vehicle owned by Italian actor Marco Leonardi (her &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3&quot; co-star), Gayheart struck nine-year-old Jorge Cruz Jr. as he walked across a street in Los Angeles. Cruz died the following day from his injuries. Gayheart paid the family () for Cruz&#x27;s funeral expenses. On August 7, 2001, Gayheart made her only public statement on the incident, in which she said: &quot;The pain of this tragedy will live with me forever. Despite the allegations in the lawsuit, the facts will establish that this was a most unfortunate accident.&quot; On November 27, 2001, Gayheart pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years of probation, a one-year suspension of her license, a $2,800 fine (), and 750 hours of community service. The parents of the boy filed a wrongful death lawsuit, which was eventually settled out of court.

<text>The Chisholm Trail ( ) was a trail used in the post-Civil War era to drive cattle overland from ranches in southern Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory, and ended at Kansas rail stops. The trail encompassed a pathway established by Black Beaver in 1861, and a wagon road established by Jesse Chisholm around 1864. &quot;The Chisholm Wagon Road went from Chisholm&#x27;s trading post on the South Canadian (north of Fort Arbuckle to the Cimarron River crossing, to the Arkansas River at the future site of Wichita where Chisholm had another trading post and on north to Abilene,&quot; according to the Kraisingers. By 1869, the entire trail from Texas to Kansas became known as the Chisholm Trail.

==Overview==
Texas ranchers using the Chisholm Trail had their cowboys start cattle drives from either the Rio Grande area or San Antonio. They joined the Chisholm Trail at the Red River, at the border between Texas and Oklahoma Territory. They continued north to the rail head of the Kansas Pacific Railway in Abilene, Kansas, where the cattle would be sold and shipped eastward. The trail is named for Jesse Chisholm, a multiracial trader from Tennessee of Cherokee and Scottish descent. Together with scout Black Beaver, he developed the trail to transport his goods from one trading post to another. The two men were the first to drive cattle north along this route.

==Business aspects==
By 1853, Texas cattle were being driven into Missouri. Local farmers began blocking the herds and turning them back because the Texas Longhorns carried ticks that caused diseases in other species of cattle. Violence, vigilante groups, and cattle rustling caused further problems for the drovers. By 1859, the driving of cattle was outlawed in many Missouri jurisdictions. By the end of the Civil War, most cattle were being moved up the western branch of trail, being gathered at Red River Station in Montague County, Texas.

In 1866, cattle in Texas were worth $4 per head, compared to over $40 per head in the North and East. Lack of market access during the Civil War had produced an overstock of cattle in Texas. In 1867, Joseph G. McCoy built stockyards in Abilene, Kansas. He encouraged Texas cattlemen to drive their herds to his stockyards. O. W. Wheeler answered McCoy&#x27;s call, and he along with partners used the Chisholm Trail to bring a herd of 2,400 head from Texas to Abilene. This herd was the first of an estimated 5,000,000 head of Texas cattle to reach Kansas over the Chisholm Trail. McCoy&#x27;s stockyards shipped 35,000 head in 1867 and became the largest stockyards west of Kansas City, Kansas.

The construction of the Union Pacific Railway through Nebraska eventually offered a cattle drive destination that was an attractive alternative to the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Between 1876 and 1884 some drives went along the Great Western Cattle Trail instead of the Chisholm Trail.

==Route==
In Texas, hundreds of feeder trails headed north to one of the main cattle trails. In the early 1840s, most cattle were driven up the Shawnee Trail. The Chisholm Trail was previously used by Indian hunting and raiding parties; the trail crossed into Indian Territory (present-day west-central Oklahoma) near Red River Station and entered Kansas near Caldwell. Through Oklahoma, the route of U.S. Highway 81 follows the Chisholm Trail through present-day towns of El Reno, Duncan, Chickasha, and Enid.

Historians consider the Chisholm Trail to have started either at Donna or San Antonio. From 1867 to 1871, the trail ended in Abilene, Kansas, but as railroads incrementally built southward, the end of the trail moved to other cities. The end of the trail moved to Newton and soon afterward to Wichita. From 1883 to 1887, the end of the trail was at Caldwell.

==Challenges==

On the long trips—up to two months—the cattlemen faced many difficulties. They had to cross major rivers such as the Arkansas and the Red and innumerable smaller creeks, as well as handle the topographic challenges of canyons, badlands and low mountain ranges. The major drives typically needed to start in the spring after the rains stimulated the growth of green grasses for the grazing cattle. The spring drives, with those rains and higher water levels with the runoff, always meant more danger at the river crossings, which had no bridges. The half-wild Texas Longhorn cattle were contrary and prone to stampede with little provocation.

The days of longest sunlight, near mid-June, were also an important consideration in the timing of drives. In addition to natural dangers, the cowboys and drovers encountered rustlers and occasional conflicts with Native Americans. The cattle drives disrupted the hunting and cultivation of crops in Indian Territory. Tribal members demanded that the trail bosses pay a toll of 10 cents per head to local tribes for the right to cross Indian lands (Oklahoma at that time was Indian Territory, governed from Fort Smith, Arkansas).

The only woman known to run her own cattle drive traveled from Texas to Wichita using the Chisholm Trail. Margaret Borland took her family, hired hands, and 2,500 Longhorns through the trail in 1873 in search of profit for her cattle, which was worth triple in Kansas over Texas prices. She died from what was called trail fever just after arriving in Wichita, after an otherwise successful journey.

==Representation in media==
The cattle drives have been a popular topic among Western genre movies. At least 27 movies have portrayed fictional accounts of the first drive along the Chisholm Trail, including &quot;The Texans&quot; (1938), directed by James P. Hogan and starring Randolph Scott and Joan Bennett; and &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Walter Brennan co-starred in both films.

The trail is the subject of at least two pop songs: &quot;The Last Cowboy Song,&quot; written and recorded by Ed Bruce, also performed by The Highwaymen; and the song &quot;The Old Chisholm Trail.&quot; Among those who have covered the song are Gene Autry, Girls of the Golden West, Woody Guthrie, Michael Martin Murphey, Tex Ritter, and Roy Rogers. Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) also covered this song, although his version was titled &quot;When I Was A Cowboy&quot;. Nova Scotia-born Wilf Carter recorded a version of the song, titled, &quot;Come A Ty-ya Yippie Yi Yo&quot;.

==Legacy==
Many schools in this region have been named after the Chisholm Trail, including:
*Chisholm Trail High School in Fort Worth, Texas
*Chisholm Trail Middle School in Olathe, Kansas 
*Chisholm Trail Middle School in Round Rock, Texas
*Chisholm Trail Middle School in Rhome, Texas
*Chisholm Trail Elementary School in Park City, Kansas
*Chisholm Middle School in Newton, Kansas
*Chisholm High School in Enid, Oklahoma
*Chisholm Elementary School in Edmond, Oklahoma
*Chisholm Trail Elementary School in Sanger, Texas
*Chisholm Trail Elementary School in Belton. Texas

The Chisholm Trail is roughly traced by U.S. Route 81 through Oklahoma, and that state has multiple museums and sites paying respect to the trail. The Chisholm Trail Heritage Center in Duncan, Oklahoma has educational and interactive exhibits, a large monument depicting a scene from a Chisholm Trail cattle drive, and a trail walkway. Trail Ruts at Monument Hill just outside of Duncan has visible traces of cattle hoofs and wagons actually left on the trail. Kingfisher, Oklahoma, has a life-size statue of Jesse Chisholm in the middle of downtown, as well as the Chisholm Trail Museum and Governor Seay Mansion which gives a clear timeline of the trail. Yukon, Oklahoma, has the Chisholm Trail Watering Hole and historic marker, while Jesse Chisholm&#x27;s gravesite is a bit further north outside Geary, Oklahoma. A mural in Enid, Oklahoma depicting the trail is located in the downtown area.

Lockhart, Texas, in Caldwell County, holds a four-day festival on the second weekend of June, to celebrate its place on the Chisholm Trail. Newton, Kansas holds a three- to four-day Chisholm Trail Festival, combining it with the annual Fourth of July celebration.

In 2014, the North Texas Tollway Authority constructed a 26-mile-long toll road named after the trail, the Chisholm Trail Parkway. It connects downtown Fort Worth to the nearby city of Cleburne in Johnson County. In 2017, the Texas Historical Commission released &quot;The Chisholm Trail: Exploring the Folklore and Legacy&quot;, an online tour and mobile app. The tour includes audio tracks and short videos that retell the history of communities and local heritage in towns and cities that line the route of the former Chisholm Trail.

<doc id="993683" wikidata="Q1344131" url="?curid=993683" title="Sparks (band)">
<text>Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed by brothers Ron (keyboards) and Russell Mael (vocals) in Los Angeles. The duo is noted for their quirky approach to songwriting; their music is often accompanied by sophisticated and lyrics—often about women, and sometimes containing literary or cinematic references—and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified by the contrast between Russell&#x27;s animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron&#x27;s deadpan scowling. Russell Mael has a distinctive wide-ranging voice, while Ron Mael plays keyboards in an intricate and rhythmic style. Their frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music.

Career highlights include &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit &quot;The Number One Song in Heaven&quot; in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and marking a stylistic shift towards new wave/synth-pop; &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot;, which made the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single &quot;I Predict&quot;, which provided Sparks&#x27; first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single &quot;Cool Places&quot; with the Go-Go&#x27;s rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and &quot;When Do I Get to Sing &#x27;My Way&#x27;, which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.

The 2002 release of &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot;, the duo&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;genre-defining opus&quot;, fused repetitive song structures with orchestral arrangements, and brought them renewed critical success. In 2015, the band released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled &quot;FFS&quot;. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released &quot;Hippopotamus&quot;, which entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7, as did their next album, &quot;A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip&quot;, released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four. In 2021, Sparks were involved in two films: the Leos Carax musical film &quot;Annette&quot; for which they wrote all songs (winning the César Award for Best Original Music), and the Edgar Wright documentary &quot;The Sparks Brothers&quot; recounting the history of the band. The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte&quot;, was released on May 26, 2023, via Island Records, and again entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7.

==History==
===Inception===
Brothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in west Los Angeles County, California, during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the L.A. club scene, when the Doors, the Standells, and Love played the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys played in the late afternoon at &quot;Teen-Age Fair&quot; at &quot;Pickwick Recreation Center&quot; in Burbank, California.

Both Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes&#x27; section of the concert film &quot;The Big T.N.T. Show&quot;, filmed in 1965. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art and Russell, theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered &quot;cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that&quot;, they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett&#x27;s Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as &quot;Anglophiles&quot;.

Their very first recordings were made under the name of &quot;Urban Renewal Project&quot;, on January 14, 1967, at the Fidelity Recording Studios in Hollywood. Four tracks were recorded with married couple Fred and Ronna Frank, who were close friends of the Maels at the time. Other members of the band were 16-year old drummer Raymond Clayton and 22-year old Harold Zellman on bass guitar. Ron was considered the lead guitarist and Russell was the singer. He also played the tambourine and harmonica. The songs were pressed on two acetates and have never been released, apart from the track &quot;Computer Girl&quot;, which was featured on a CD included with the Japanese semi-biography from 2006 and more widely released on the &quot;Past Tense&quot; greatest hits album in 2019. The other three tracks were titled &quot;The Windmill&quot;, &quot;A Quick Thought&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Of all four songs, &quot;Computer Girl&quot; was the least traditional. Russell plays pan flute on &quot;A Quick Thought&quot;.

Forming &quot;Halfnelson&quot;, named after a wrestling hold, in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their debut album was released on Bearsville Records in 1971 with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey&#x27;s brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing. It sold poorly. &quot;The Whole Burbank Catalog&quot;, a 1972 Warner Brothers $2, 2-LP loss leader sampler included, &quot;Biology II&quot;. After renaming themselves Sparks in 1972, a play on the Marx Brothers, the album was then re-released by Bearsville Records in 1972 as Sparks. The re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit &quot;Wonder Girl&quot;.

Their follow-up album, &quot;A Woofer in Tweeter&#x27;s Clothing&quot;, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following. 
===1973–1976: the Island Records years===
Relocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John&#x27;s Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two &quot;Whistle Test&quot; performance, they placed an ad in music weekly &quot;Melody Maker&quot; (&quot;Wanted bass player for Sparks. Must be beard free and exciting&quot;) and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman &quot;Dinky&quot; Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough &quot;Kimono My House&quot; in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;.

Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, &quot;Amateur Hour&quot; and &quot;Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth&quot; led to many appearances on the BBC&#x27;s flagship music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Russell&#x27;s hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron&#x27;s expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache.

Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the &quot;Kimono&quot; and &quot;Propaganda&quot; albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert. Flo &amp; Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977.

The follow-up albums, &quot;Propaganda&quot; and &quot;Indiscreet&quot;, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles &quot;Looks, Looks, Looks&quot;, &quot;Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;Something for the Girl with Everything&quot;.

===1976–1979: return to America and transition to synthpop===
The Maels returned home to Los Angeles in 1976. Concerned that their music may have become stale, they adopted a more &quot;American&quot; sound and recorded &quot;Big Beat&quot; with Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser on production, which they followed with &quot;Introducing Sparks;&quot; both albums were mostly recorded with session musicians. This new &quot;West Coast&quot; sound yielded such songs as &quot;Nothing to Do&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Stupid&quot;, and &quot;Throw Her Away (and Get a New One)&quot;. In 1976, Sparks made one of their first forays into the movie business, making a cameo appearance in the disaster-suspense film &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, after Kiss turned down the roles. They performed the songs &quot;Fill &#x27;Er Up&quot; and &quot;Big Boy&quot;.

By 1977 the brothers found themselves at a crossroads. They had cut ties with Hewlett and had grown tired of recording within a traditional rock band framework. In a conversation with a German journalist, they expressed their admiration for Giorgio Moroder, a pioneer of electronic disco and pop music. Moroder happened to be a friend of the journalist, and she was able to connect the brothers with the Italian producer, who produced their next album, &quot;No. 1 in Heaven.&quot; More electronic and synthesizer-based than their previous efforts, the album would redefine Sparks&#x27; sound and challenge the concept of what is meant by a band, and it also became a major influence on emerging electronic pop artists. It spawned two singles in the top-fifteen UK chart: &quot;The Number One Song in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Beat The Clock&quot;. The follow-up album in 1980, &quot;Terminal Jive&quot;, had a hit single in France, &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot; ,which led to the Maels staying in the country for a year promoting the album, during which Russell became conversationally fluent in French. The single also hit the Top 20 in Australia, reaching No.14. In 1981, Belgian synth pop group Telex enlisted Sparks to help write the lyrics for their third album, Sex.

===1979–1990: the Los Angeles years===

Finding the electronic equipment that they had adopted for their new sound too cumbersome for touring, the band returned to the more conventional band format for their next three releases, although they did not eschew synthesizers entirely: &quot;Whomp That Sucker,&quot; &quot;Angst in My Pants,&quot; (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie &quot;Valley Girl&quot;) and &quot;In Outer Space&quot;. They broke into the US singles chart once more, reaching No. 49 with &quot;Cool Places&quot; from 1983&#x27;s &quot;In Outer Space&quot;. The track was a collaboration with the Go-Go&#x27;s rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin (a dedicated fan of the band who at one time ran her own Sparks fan club), and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles&#x27; KROQ-FM radio station, which hailed them as local heroes. In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film &quot;Bad Manners&quot; (aka: &quot;Growing Pains&quot;), including the film&#x27;s title song, &quot;Bad Manners&quot;. In 1989, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with &quot;Singing in the Shower&quot;, sung in duet with Rita Mitsouko: the single was produced by Tony Visconti.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; into a musical, with interest from Tim Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Ed Wood&quot; for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony&#x27;s Columbia Pictures. The release of &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot;, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a &quot;second wind&quot;, vocalist Russell Mael explained. &quot;The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.&quot; On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.

===1990–2002: &quot;Gratuitous Sax &amp; Senseless Violins&quot; and &quot;Balls&quot;===
In 1993, Ron and Russell returned with the non-album single &quot;National Crime Awareness Week&quot;, their first release since the 1988 album &quot;Interior Design&quot;. The song was produced by the Scottish dance band Finitribe. In 1994, the Maels released &quot;Gratuitous Sax &amp; Senseless Violins&quot;, providing the hit singles &quot;When Do I Get to Sing &#x27;My Way&#x27; and &quot;When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)&quot;. In Germany, &quot;When Do I Get to Sing &#x27;My Way was the No. 1 airplay song for 1994 as well as being hailed critically for its poignant lyrics and touching melody. The band toured in support of the album with percussionist Christi Haydon playing drums. Haydon also appeared in the videos for &quot;When Do I Get to Sing &#x27;My Way&#x27;&quot; and &quot;When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)&quot;, which were both directed by Sophie Muller.

1997 saw the release of &quot;Plagiarism&quot;, an album of cover versions of their own songs featuring collaborations with Faith No More, Erasure and Jimmy Somerville. Half of the album was recorded by Tony Visconti in London with the other half recorded by the brothers in their own purpose-built studio in LA, surrounded by busts of Elvis. In 1998 they recorded the soundtrack for the action film &quot;Knock Off&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by the acclaimed Hong Kong-based producer/director Tsui Hark (who had appeared on his own tribute song by the band on the album &quot;Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins&quot;).

&quot;Balls&quot;, released in 2000, again put the band in a context of electronic instrumentation with some of Ron&#x27;s most striking and perceptive lyrics. With the release of &quot;Balls&quot; the band toured the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia.

===2002–2009: &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot; and &quot;Exotic Creatures of the Deep&quot;===
After &quot;Balls&quot;, the band resurfaced in 2002 with the release of an album described as what they called their &quot;genre-defining opus&quot; – &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot;, featuring quasi-classical arrangements of strings and choirs. &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot; led to renewed interest in the band. &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine named the album as one of its &quot;Best New Albums of 2002&quot;, describing it as &quot;...possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long-established act&quot; and later in 2003 saying &quot;...it really does feel like one of the best albums ever recorded.&quot; A UK and European tour had the band playing the entire album each night in the first half of the show, with fan favourites making up the second. The line-up now included former Faith No More guitarist Dean Menta in addition to Tammy Glover on drums. Long-time fan Morrissey invited Sparks to perform at the 2004 Meltdown Festival, of which he was curator. They performed their breakthrough &quot;Kimono My House&quot; album, followed by &quot;Lil Beethoven&quot;, both in their entirety. Also in this period, the duo appeared in the music video for the Darkness&#x27; Justin Hawkins&#x27;s cover of &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, in which Ron and Russell play the referee and MC at a darts match between Hawkins and darts champion Phil Taylor. This version of &quot;This Town&quot; reached No.6 in the UK charts. Sparks would later release &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot;″s closing track &quot;Suburban Homeboy&quot; as a single.

February 2006 saw the release of &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;, their twentieth studio album. The album is regarded as carrying on where &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot; left off, being described as &quot;...cynical, intelligent and very, very funny&quot;, it has met with considerable acclaim. Sparks led off the album with the striking tune that the BBC deemed too provocative in its title to play, &quot;Dick Around&quot;. The song is a multi-section, multi-mood, highly layered track that many felt should have been a UK smash hit had the BBC not misinterpreted the title of the song as being other than it was.

The brothers were dismissive of the latest trends in popular music at this time, seeing most contemporary bands as lacking musical ambition and experimental drive. Indeed, the predictable trends in much of modern rock served as inspiration for &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;. However, they have expressed admiration for Eminem and Morrissey.

The pair appeared in the season 6 finale of the US TV show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, performing &quot;Perfume&quot; from the album &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;. They released a live DVD of a September 2006 show at The Forum as well as a long-awaited CD release of their previously unavailable 1977 album &quot;Introducing Sparks&quot;. The track &quot;Perfume&quot; was featured in a Dolce &amp; Gabbana TV commercial in 2009.

On May 12, 2008, Sparks released the single &quot;Good Morning&quot;, taken from the album &quot;Exotic Creatures of the Deep&quot;.

May and June 2008 saw the 21-night &quot;Sparks Spectacular&quot; in London, where they played each of their albums in chronological order during the first twenty nights and premiered their new album on the twenty-first concert on June 13, 2008. Each night, they performed an album in its entirety followed by a rare track– many of the songs had never been performed live before. The band asked their fans to visit their website and vote for the track that they&#x27;d most like to hear the band perform during the second half of the 21st concert after the premiere of &quot;Exotic Creatures of the Deep&quot;, though Russell admitted that he and Ron would probably influence the poll a little.

Fans who bought a &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; (which allowed entry into all 21 gigs) also received a poster signed by the band and a CD single entitled &quot;Islington N1&quot;, a reference to the postal address of the venue for the first 20 gigs. The song &quot;Islington N1&quot; was later made available in the box set edition of their &quot;New Music For Amnesiacs&quot; career-spanning box set.

In 2009 the band played two consecutive nights at The Forum on 20 and 21 March. They played &quot;Exotic Creatures of the Deep&quot; in its entirety at both gigs, followed by &quot;Kimono My House&quot; in its entirety on the first night and &quot;No.1 in Heaven&quot; in its entirety on the second night.

Valentine&#x27;s Day evening 2009 saw Sparks perform the same show featuring their &quot;Exotic Creatures of the Deep&quot; and &quot;Kimono My House&quot; albums played in their entirety before a sold-out hometown crowd at Royce Hall at the Mael Bros. alma mater in Los Angeles, UCLA.

Ron and Russell appeared as interview subjects in the 2009 documentary &quot;The Magnificent Tati&quot;, discussing their involvement during the early 1980s in &quot;Confusion&quot;, a proposed Jacques Tati movie for which a screenplay was written but never shot (due to Tati&#x27;s death).

===2009: &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot;===

The band premiered the radio musical &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot;, in August 2009. Commissioned by the Swedish public radio (SR) it featured the Mael brothers themselves along with Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsjö, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, tells the story of Bergman&#x27;s relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. The UK&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London two months later whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q&amp;A with the Maels.

In June 2011, as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sparks presented the World Premiere live performance of &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot; at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. Canadian film director Guy Maddin provided directions based on the screenplay, with Ron and Russell reprising their recorded roles on stage. The role of Ingmar Bergman was performed by Finnish movie actor Peter Franzén and American actress Ann Magnuson portrayed the role of Greta Garbo. The group showcased at the film festival in an attempt to raise funding for a feature film version.

Since 2011, the band have been pursuing the idea of turning &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot; into a feature film. Originally envisaged as a live-action film, in 2017, the Mael Brothers announced they were taking a new direction and developing Bergman as an animated feature film with director Joseph Wallace, who created the music video for their track &quot;Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)&quot;. As of 2024 no film version of the musical has been made.

===2010–2019: &quot;FFS&quot; and &quot;Hippopotamus&quot;===
In 2010, Sparks remixed Yoko Ono&#x27;s song &quot;Give Me Something&quot;. In July they contributed a remix of sorts to singer Katie Melua&#x27;s single, A Happy Place, calling it &quot;Sparks VS. Melua.&quot; September 2 marked the debut of the new theme songs that Ron and Russell had composed and recorded for NPR radio&#x27;s Bookworm show, broadcast in Los Angeles on station KCRW. The two songs, titled &quot;Where Would We Be Without Books?&quot; and &quot;I Am A Bookworm&quot;, were commissioned by show host and Sparks fan Michael Silverblatt as the first new theme songs for the programme in 21 years.

For the encore of what may have been the final live date ever in America for Faith No More on December 1 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Ron and Russell Mael were invited by Mike Patton and Co. to perform the Sparks&#x27; classic hit &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;. They reprised the song that also appears as a collaboration with Faith No More on Sparks&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Plagiarism&quot; and had also been released as a single.

In 2012 Ron and Russell collaborated with singer Gemma Ray who released a limited 12-inch single titled &quot;Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks)&quot;, which included Ray&#x27;s covers of Sparks&#x27; &quot;How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall&quot; and &quot;Eaten by the Monster of Love&quot;. In October, Ron and Russell performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled &quot;Two Hands One Mouth&quot; began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and finished with a sold-out show at the Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan and the US, including two performances at the Coachella Festival, with a show in Paris following in 2013 where they were joined on stage by Catherine Ringer from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration &quot;Singing in The Shower&quot;. Recordings from the tour resulted in Sparks first live album, &quot;Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe,&quot; which was released later in 2013. Ron and Russell continued touring in the duo format for a second round, titling the tour &quot;The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth&quot;, taking in dates in both North America and Europe, including Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas, and three nights at Union Chapel in London, where Thurston Moore joined them to play guitar on &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;. Both &quot;Two Hands One Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth&quot; tours were critically well received. In 2013 they contributed a song and brief voice part to the Guy Maddin movie &quot;The Forbidden Room&quot;.

2014 marked the 40th Anniversary of &quot;Kimono My House&quot;. The landmark was celebrated with a performance the album in its entirety, along with a greatest hits set, at the Barbican Centre in London on 19 and 20 December with backing from the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra. Ron and Russell took the &quot;Kimono My House&quot; celebrations to Los Angeles as they performed the album on two consecutive nights with a 38-piece orchestra at the United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel Los Angeles on 14 and 15 February 2015. Both shows sold out and they received glowing reviews. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand joined them on stage for duet with Russell on the song &quot;&quot;When Do I Get to Sing &#x27;My Way&quot; on both nights.

Before Kapranos&#x27;s appearance in Los Angeles, Sparks and Franz Ferdinand had been collaborating and in late 2014 had recorded an album together, produced by John Congleton. The supergroup, named FFS, was unveiled in March 2015 with a short teaser video of song &quot;The Power Couple&quot;. An eponymous album was released in June 2015. The album was promoted with appearances on BBC programme Later with Jools Holland, and the Glastonbury Festival.

Sparks&#x27;s 23rd studio album&quot;, Hippopotamus,&quot; was released in September 2017 to critical and commercial success, peaking at number 7 in the UK Albums Chart. A full band tour, starting in Copenhagen, was undertaken to support the record. In 2019, Sparks collaborated with and were featured on French artist Sebastian&#x27;s album, &quot;Thirst&quot; on the track, &quot;Handcuffed to a Parking Meter&quot;.

===2020s: &quot;A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip&quot;, &quot;Annette&quot; and &quot;The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte&quot;===
The band&#x27;s first album of the 2020s, &quot;A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip&quot;, was released in digital form in May 2020, with the physical release pushed back to July due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album was preceded by singles &quot;Self-Effacing&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Toast&quot; in February and March, respectively. Like its predecessor, &quot;Hippopotamus&quot;, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7 and garnered universal critical acclaim. Coinciding with the physical release of the album, an official music video for the song &quot;The Existential Threat&quot; premiered on YouTube, the animation created by English freelance animator and composer Cyriak Harris. The band then collaborated with Todd Rundgren on the single &quot;Your Fandango&quot;, 50 years after he produced their debut album.

Sparks were involved in two 2021 film releases, as screenwriters and composers for the musical &quot;Annette&quot;, directed by Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and in &quot;The Sparks Brothers&quot;, a documentary about their career directed by Edgar Wright. &quot;Annette&quot; premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The leading track &quot;So May We Start&quot; was accompanied by a video featuring the band with Driver and Cotillard, and the &quot;Annette&quot; soundtrack was released on Sony.

In February 2022 Sparks played two sold-out shows at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, their first full concerts since 2018 following postponements of tour dates throughout 2020 and 2021. &quot;Variety&quot; lauded the first concert as &quot;a rousingly celebratory homecoming&quot;. North American and European spring tours followed, then festival dates in the US and Japan. The Maels performed at the 2022 Césars, France&#x27;s national film award ceremony, and received a César for best original music for &quot;Annette&quot;.

In November 2022, Focus Features announced they would be producing a new musical titled &#x27;X-Crucior&#x27; to be written and produced by the Mael brothers. Their next studio album, titled &quot;The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte&quot;, and a world tour were confirmed for 2023. Sparks re-signed to Island Records in January 2023. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte&quot;, features a music video released on March 3 with actress Cate Blanchett dancing to the song. &quot;Latte&quot; was the best selling physical album in the UK on the week of release, and the tour supporting it included some remarkable firsts for the band: Two shows at the Royal Albert Hall, Glastonbury Festival (featuring Cate Blanchett), the Hollywood Bowl with They Might Be Giants, and the Sydney Opera House. 

Social media posts in September 2024 had the brothers posing with John Woo, teasing a collaboration with the hashtag #xcrucior. John Woo&#x27;s official Instagram account also posted the photo with hints at a &quot;new project&quot; and commented &quot;maybe not action&quot; (the genre he is most famous for working in). Woo has wanted to direct a musical for a long time, and shares a love of French cinema with the Maels (particularly The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg). On September 9th he confirmed working on a &quot;half-musical&quot; with Sparks.

On October 17, 2024, Sparks received the honor of Outstanding Contribution to Music at the 2024 AIM Independent Music Awards, where they announced that they had signed to Transgressive Records for the release of their forthcoming album, entitled &quot;MAD!&quot;.

==Style==
Sparks is regarded as an art pop band.
Their musical style has varied dramatically with Russell Mael&#x27;s distinctive wide-ranging voice (in particular his far-reaching falsetto) and Ron Mael&#x27;s intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style is the common thread throughout their fifty-year career. In its review of &quot;Kimono My House&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; described Russell&#x27;s falsetto as a &quot;stratospheric blend of Marc Bolan and Tiny Tim&quot;. In the beginning, they attempted to emulate the sound of their English idols, such as the Who, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and the Kinks, sometimes even pretending to be an English band while on the LA club circuit. They relocated to England during the glam rock era where, despite cutting an odd figure on this scene, they found success with their polished brand of intricate pop tunes and convoluted lyrics. Early albums such as &quot;Kimono My House&quot; combined glam rock with elements of bubblegum pop and baroque music. By the second half of the decade, they were concerned that the sound they had developed while based in England was in danger of becoming stale; they returned to LA, determined to adopt a more &quot;West Coast&quot; sound. This they achieved with producer Rupert Holmes on &quot;Big Beat&quot; and (sans Holmes) on &quot;Introducing Sparks&quot;.

The band were not satisfied with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record &quot;No.1 in Heaven&quot; which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988&#x27;s &quot;Interior Design&quot;. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994&#x27;s &quot;Gratuitous Sax &amp; Senseless Violins&quot;, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.

In 2002, the band switched to a classically influenced art pop style with the release of their album &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot;, replacing the beat-driven synth-pop of their previous albums with complex orchestral arrangements. The band acknowledged this change in style on the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;The Rhythm Thief&quot;.

Lyrically, the band&#x27;s style has been described as coming from &quot;the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre&quot;. Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Taking Me Home&quot; of &quot;Lil&#x27; Beethoven&quot; (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, &quot;Your Call Is Very Important To Us&quot;, uses a corporation style call-hold message: &quot;Your call is very important to us. Please hold&quot; which is then sung with some additional words: &quot;At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold.&quot; The only other lyrics in the song are &quot;Red light&quot;, &quot;Green light&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Mixed Signals&quot; and &quot;Sorry, I&#x27;m Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold&quot;. These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.

The vocal sound on the single &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot; was criticised as &quot;stylised&quot;. This may be because the song was written without any regard for the vocal style of Russell Mael. Ron Mael has explained:

&quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot; was written in A, and by God, it&#x27;ll be sung in A. I just feel that if you&#x27;re coming up with most of the music, then you have an idea where it&#x27;s going to go. And no singer is gonna get in my way.

Russell Mael has claimed in reply:

When he wrote &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, Ron could only play it in that key. It was so much work to transpose the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain&#x27;t a &quot;rock&quot; voice. It&#x27;s not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It&#x27;s not about &quot;guts&quot;. It&#x27;s untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks&#x27; lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.
==Legacy==
Sparks has influenced many later genres including synth-pop, new wave, post-punk, and alternative rock, influencing a wide range of singers and bands including Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sonic Youth, They Might Be Giants, and Björk.

Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols said that he constantly listened to &quot;Kimono My House&quot; back in 1974 at Paul Cook&#x27;s room. &quot;We&#x27;d sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them&quot;. Joy Division cited &quot;Number One Song in Heaven&quot; as a primary influence during the recording of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;. Joy Division&#x27;s drummer Stephen Morris stated: &quot;When we were doing &#x27;Love Will Tear Us Apart&#x27;, there were two records we were into: Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Greatest Hits and Number One Song in Heaven by Sparks. That was the beginning of getting interested in Giorgio Moroder&quot;. Peter Hook of New Order cited Moroder&#x27;s production on &quot;The Number One Song in Heaven&quot; as a major influence when his band changed musical style to produce electro/dance-rock songs like &quot;Temptation&quot; in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of &quot;When I&#x27;m With You&quot; that same year in Milan. When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan and composer Martin Gore of Depeche Mode cited them as one of their favorite bands. Gore also later covered &quot;Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth&quot; on his &quot;Counterfeit EP&quot; in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League, and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about &quot;This Town ain&#x27;t...&quot;: &quot;There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song.&quot;

Sparks have also been name-checked by indie pop band the Smiths. Their singer Morrissey named &quot;Kimono My House&quot; as one of &quot;his favourite LPs of all time&quot;. Smiths&#x27; guitarist and composer Johnny Marr said: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing better than commerciality crossed with an interesting mind&quot; and named &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for the Both of Us&quot; as an instance, qualifying it as one of these &quot;Trojan singles&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a version of the first Sparks&#x27; success as the opening song of their covers album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth also included the Sparks&#x27; song &quot;Equator&quot; in his list of all-time favorite songs. Joey Ramone also mentioned his liking for their records, as did later the group They Might Be Giants. Devo&#x27;s singer Mark Mothersbaugh described himself as a big &quot;Ron Mael fan&quot; and of his look: &quot;it was so not rock n&#x27; roll, in an unexpected way, that you just couldn&#x27;t help but think that there was something there&quot;. He also listened to &quot;Kimono my House&quot; during his formative years.

Björk talked about &quot;Kimono my House&quot; as one of the records that changed her life. &quot;[Sparks] were exotic ... [they] were the most refreshing thing in my life&quot; when she was eight. &quot;I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people&quot;. Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: &quot;I saw Sparks play on American Bandstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought &quot;Indiscreet&quot;. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, &quot;why I love the Sparks&quot;. He said about their music: &quot;It&#x27;s only after a few listens you really can get into it ... Then you really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can&#x27;t imagine life without them.&quot; John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers said that he used to listen to &quot;Kimono My House&quot; and &quot;Propaganda&quot; for Adrian Fisher&#x27;s guitar playing adding, &quot;I&#x27;m sure that it is Ron Mael who told him what to play&quot;.

Other notable acts that have mentioned Sparks include Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, and Cait Brennan. Electronic band Justice hailed the group saying: &quot;this is ... something we like in music, this kind of epic feeling, ... and we were really inspired by bands like Sparks ... who have this really operatic sound&quot;. In 2012, synth-pop duo Spray released the song &quot;Sparks Called and They Want Their Ideas Back&quot;.

In 1980, Paul McCartney also gave a nod to the band in the music video for &quot;Coming Up&quot;, in which he mimicked Ron Mael on keyboards.

<doc id="993691" wikidata="Q835684" url="?curid=993691" title="Clicker">
<text>A clicker, sometimes called a cricket, is any device that makes a clicking sound, usually when deliberately activated by its user.

They usually consist of a piece of thin metal or plastic held in a casing so that the metal is slightly torqued; depressing one end of the metal causes it to pop out of alignment and releasing it causes it to pop back into alignment, each time making a sharp click.

With some clickers, the user depresses the metal directly with thumb or finger; with others, a button extends above the surface of the casing so that depressing the button makes the metal click.

==Social uses==
*In World War II clickers were used by Allied paratroopers preceding and during Operation Overlord as a way of covertly identifying friend from foe. A soldier would click once and if two clicks were received in return from an unidentifiable soldier then his identification was confirmed.
*Clickers are used to provide audible feedback for human students learning using a method called TAGteach.
*Clickers were used to organize Catholic group activity.
&quot;The clickers were dime store crickets that made a nice, loud click, perfect for signaling a First Communion class so all the kids would stand up at the same time, and kneel at the same time, and start filing down the aisle together.&quot; — Roger Ebert

==Animal training uses==

Clickers were first used by marine mammal trainer Karen Pryor as a way of communicating with their animals. Dolphins and whales communicate underwater through a series of clicks and whistles known as echolocation, and the clicker allowed a trainer to produce signals they were more likely to understand.

Clickers are now used to train dogs, and other animals. When associated with a treat, a click allows the owner to mark the precise moment the desired behavior is executed.

==Other uses==
*Clickers are also used as a handheld counting device, sometimes digital but more commonly mechanical, used to keep a count of the numbers of people entering a venue. It is often used by nightclub doorstaff to make sure fire limits are not exceeded.
*A clicker is a device used on recurve bows to signal to the archer that correct draw length has been achieved, thus aiding consistency.
*Some board games designed after game shows come with clickers that are meant to emulate the buzzers common on such shows.

<text>Jonathan Hugger (born April 20, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and author. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling under the ring name Johnny the Bull, for World Wrestling Entertainment under the ring name Johnny Stamboli, and for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Lucha Libre AAA World Wide and Lucha Libre USA under the ring name Rellik.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001) ===

While attending college in Atlanta, Georgia and working as a doorman at the Club Oxygen nightclub, Hugger exercised at the Main Event Fitness gym, which was owned by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) employees Lex Luger and Sting. During one of his visits to the gym, WCW employee Diamond Dallas Page met with Hugger and encouraged him to train as a wrestler. Hugger subsequently participated alongside 19 other prospective wrestlers in a $240 tryout at the WCW&#x27;s Power Plant training center. The tryout featured press ups, sprinting, squats and freestyle wrestling in temperatures of over 100 degrees. Hugger passed the tryout, but did not immediately begin training as a wrestler. Six months later, he was attacked and stabbed six times. Hugger resolved to change his lifestyle, which he believed had resulted in his assault, and enlisted in the Power Plant, where he was finally trained to wrestle in earnest.

After training, Hugger debuted for WCW as &quot;Johnny Hugger&quot; on the September 28, 1999 episode of &quot;WCW WorldWide&quot;, losing to Chuck Palumbo. Hugger&#x27;s WCW Pay-Per-View debut came at their December 19, 1999 Starrcade. He adopted the ring name &quot;Johnny the Bull&quot; and formed a Mafia-themed tag team called the Mamalukes with Big Vito, which was managed by Tony Marinara.

On January 18, 2000 in Evansville, Indiana, Hugger and Big Vito defeated Crowbar and David Flair for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. The match was broadcast on the January 19 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;. They held the championship until February 12, when they were defeated by Creative Control in Oberhausen during a tour of Germany. The Mamalukes regained the championship on the following day in Leipzig, and held it until March 19, when they lost to Creative Control in a no disqualification match at the pay-per-view Uncensored, which took place in the AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, Florida.

On June 5, 2000, The Mamalukes attacked Hardcore Champion Terry Funk during a title defense against WCW President Eric Bischoff, enabling Bischoff to defeat Funk. On the June 7 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Bischoff awarded the Hardcore Championship to The Mamalukes, making them co-champions. On June 19, Big Vito defeated Hugger to become the undisputed Hardcore Champion. On the July 3 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, while wrestling Funk in a hardcore match, Hugger tore his urethra while executing a diving leg drop and was sidelined for two months while recuperating.

On the September 11, 2000 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hugger returned to betray Vito and join several other Power Plant graduates in a stable known as the Natural Born Thrillers, a collection of young wrestlers who sought to challenge more established wrestlers. Hugger eventually reconciled with Vito and reformed the Mamalukes, and the two continued teaming until WCW&#x27;s closure in March 2001. Their final match in WCW was a loss to the team of Lance Storm and Mike Awesome on the March 12 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2001–2004)===

In March 2001, WCW was purchased by its Stamford, Connecticut-based rival, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Hugger&#x27;s contract was bought out by the WWF. Johnny the Bull wrestled one dark match before the July 12, 2001 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, losing to Rob Van Dam. Johnny the Bull was introduced to the promotion as a member of The Alliance but after a single appearance on WWF television, Hugger was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association, an Ohio-based WWF developmental territory, in late July 2001, to further his training. While in the HWA, he won the promotion&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship on two occasions in 2002.

After the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment in May 2002, Hugger returned to WWF television on the June 30, 2002 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; under the ring name Johnny &quot;The Bull&quot; Stamboli, losing via disqualification to Tommy Dreamer. On the July 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stamboli won the Hardcore Championship, his first title in WWE, from Bradshaw. Bradshaw would, however, regain the title from Hugger later that night. On the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stamboli won the Hardcore Championship once again after pinning Jeff Hardy, but lost the title a few seconds later to Tommy Dreamer. Following this, he became a mainstay on &quot;Heat&quot; and would later turn face due to fan reaction in late September 2002.

On February 13, 2003, Stamboli was moved to the SmackDown! brand and became a heel again when he allied with Nunzio and Chuck Palumbo to attack Rikishi. Together, the trio became the Full Blooded Italians. The FBI would go on to wrestle throughout 2003 and early 2004 before disbanding on March 22, 2004 when Palumbo was moved to the Raw brand. Stamboli and Nunzio continued to team together until he was released from his WWE contract on November 4.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2004–2005) ===

Following his release from WWE, Hugger began wrestling for the Japanese All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion after his friend Troy Endres, who was portraying a fake Great Muta, retired after tearing both of his anterior cruciate ligaments and nominated Hugger as his replacement. Hugger donned a mask and adopted the character of GREAT MUTA, losing to the real Great Muta at The Unchained World on December 5, 2004 in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.

On January 2, 2005 in the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Hugger dropped his Great Muta character and formed a stable with Taru known as the Voodoo Murders. The Voodoo Murders, who declared that they wished to destroy AJPW, eventually expanded to include several other WCW and WWE alumni, including Chuck Palumbo.

===Independent circuit (2005–2007)===
In 2005, Hugger and Chuck Palumbo reformed the Full Blooded Italians in the Italy-based Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion. In 2006, Hugger toured Mexico, teaming with Marco Corleone in the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre promotion. In late 2006, Hugger began working for the Arizona-based Impact Zone Wrestling promotion, where he created a character named REDRUM, a reference to the 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot;. Hugger based Redrum on the Great Muta character he had portrayed in AJPW.

In the summer of 2007, Hugger wrestled two dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment, using the ring name The Unknown Wrestler defeating Chavo Guerrero Jr.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2008)===
In late 2007, Hugger exhibited his REDRUM character for Jeff Jarrett, Vince Russo and Terry Taylor, members of the creative team of the Orlando, Florida-based Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, and was subsequently hired. He debuted in TNA on November 11, 2007 at the pay-per-view Genesis. In his next appearance, his ring name was changed to Rellik (killer spelt backwards). He then aligned himself with Black Reign and James Mitchell, with he and Reign forming a tag team. In their debut match as a team, they lost to Abyss and Raven at Turning Point in a Match of 10,000 Tacks. After losing several matches, the team picked up its first and only victory after defeating The Motor City Machineguns on the March 10, 2008 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. On the April 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rellik and Black Reign made their final appearance as a team in a losing effort to Team 3D in the first round of the Deuces Wild tournament. After losing three dark matches in mid-May, Hugger left TNA. After TNA, Hugger returned to the independent circuit until the end of the year. For 2009 he was inactive from wrestling.

===Lucha Libre USA (2010–2011)===
Hugger returned to wrestling on June 6, 2010 Lucha Libre USA debut match saw him, as Rellik, team with Misteriosito in a losing effort against Lujo Esquire and Octagoncito. Rellik took part in a tournament to crown number one contenders for the LLUSA Heavyweight Championship but was defeated by Charly Malice in the first round of the tournament. Hugger Joined Lizmark, Jr.&#x27;s stable Treachery along with Sydistiko. On December 12, 2010, Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) defeated Dinastia (El Oriental and Tinieblas, Jr.) in a tag match to advance into the 3-way tag team title match, Rellik helped Lizmark, Jr. to win the LLUSA Heavyweight Championship by blinding Marco Corleone with powder. On January 22, 2011, Rudisimo (El Oriental and Tinieblas, Jr.) defeated Puerto Rican Power (P.R. Flyer and San Juan Kid) and Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) in a three-way tag match to become the inaugural Lucha Libre USA Tag Team Champions. On March 19, Marco Corleone and Shane Helms defeated Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) in a tag team match, and later on in the main event, Rellik took part in a lucha roulette elimination number one contenders match for the LLUSA Championship, which was won by Charly Malice.

=== Independent circuit (2011–2014)===
Hugger wrestled as Johnny Stamboli for the Phoenix, Arizona based IWF promotion. He teamed with Tyson Tyler as &quot;G.F.Y.&quot;.
Hugger also appeared in IWF as &quot;REDRUM,&quot; a character similar to Rellik. As REDRUM, Hugger lost via disqualification to The Hurricane on May 15, 2014. As of January 2025, according to Cagematch.net, this was Hugger&#x27;s most recent wrestling match.

==Personal life==
In July 2016, Hugger was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.

<text>HMS &quot;Vidette&quot; (D48) was an Admiralty V-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. Built at the end of the First World War, she served in the final months of that conflict, and saw extensive service in the inter war years and in World War II. She was an effective convoy escort and U-boat killer, being credited with the destruction of five U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic.
HMS Vidette transported Spike Island Republican Prisoners to Bere Island Internment Camp in 1921. *Refer Spike Island’s Republican Prisoners, 1921 by Tom O’Neill MA.

==Construction==
&quot;Vidette&quot; was ordered under the 1916–17 War Emergency Programme from Alexander Stephens &amp; Sons Limited in Linthouse, Govan. She was laid down on 1 February 1917, was launched on 28 February 1918, and completed on 27 April the same year.

&quot;Vidette&quot; served with the Grand Fleet to the end of World War I, and was placed in Reserve in 1923.
She spent most of the 1920s and 1930s in reserve, but was brought back to active service in 1939 for World War II. In the picture, taken probably in 1939, she is wearing the funnel bands of the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth; one red over one white. Early in the war she would have landed the after set of torpedo tubes and shipped a QF 12 pounder 12 cwt gun in lieu.

&quot;Vidette&quot; received several refits and modifications during her service career. In 1923 she was equipped with submarine detection gear (ASDIC), one of the first British warships so outfitted. In 1939 she was refitted for convoy escort and anti-submarine warfare duty. In October 1941 during a refit at Gibraltar she received Type 286M radar.
In September 1942 she was converted to a Long-Range Escort, landing her torpedo equipment and receiving additional anti-submarine weapons. She also had boilers removed and replaced with fuel tanks, reducing her overall speed but enhancing her range and endurance.

==Service history==
At the outbreak of war in September 1939 &quot;Vidette&quot; was assigned to Gibraltar, as part of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla. She served there for the first three years, where she carried out convoy escort and general fleet duties.

In July 1940, after the fall of France, &quot;Vidette&quot; was with Force H during Operation Catapult, the neutralization of the French Fleet. On 3 July she was part of the screen for British ships shelling the French squadron at Mers-el-Kebir. Three days later she returned with Force H for Operation Lever, the sinking of the battleship &quot;Dunkerque&quot;.
In early November she took part in Operation Collar, running aircraft reinforcements to the Malta garrison, and on 27 November took part in the battle of Spartivento.

In January 1941 she sailed with convoy WS 5A as far as Freetown, where she joined the West Africa station local escort.
In October she returned to Gibraltar and refitted; later that month she was detailed to assist HG 75, working to save HMS &quot;Cossack&quot;, which had been torpedoed. The crew were saved, but the ship foundered under tow back to Gibraltar.

In May 1942 she returned to Gibraltar for Operation Bowery, and later Operation LB, both air reinforcement missions (&quot;Club Runs&quot;) for Malta.
In June she took part In Operation Harpoon, an ill-fated convoy mission to Malta.
In September she returned to Britain for conversion as a Long-Range Escort, after which she joined the Western Approaches Command for operations in the North Atlantic.

After conversion &quot;Vidette&quot; was assigned to B-7 Escort Group, led by Cdr. Peter Gretton. After several uneventful crossings &quot;Vidette&quot; and B-7 EG were involved in several crucial battles. March 1943 saw fighting around convoys HX 231 with the loss of six ships sunk and three U-boats destroyed. In late April ONS 5 saw thirteen ships sunk and six U-boats destroyed; &quot;Vidette&quot; was credited with one (i.e. ; later revised to two, and ) of these: In late May SC 130 saw at least three U-boats destroyed for no losses.

During the autumn of 1943 B-7 served as a Support Group reinforcing several convoys as they came under attack. During this period &quot;Vidette&quot; took part in the destruction of two more U-boats, and .

In May 1944 &quot;Vidette&quot; was operating in the English Channel as part of Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Normandy landings.
In August she took part in the destruction of .

With the end of hostilities in Europe &quot;Vidette&quot; was paid off in June 1945; she was sold for scrapping in April 1947.

==Battle honours== 
During her service &quot;Vidette&quot; was awarded five battle honours:
*Atlantic 1940–44
*Spartivento 1940
*Malta convoys 1942
*Normandy 1944
*English Channel 1944

==Successes==
During her service &quot;Vidette&quot; was credited with the destruction of five U-boats:

This concert was the fifth ever live performance by the &quot;Islands&quot; version of King Crimson. The CD release was adapted from the original soundboard tape, mixed by Peter Sinfield. An audience bootleg was added to repair the missing introduction to &quot;Get Thy Bearings&quot;.

The liner notes were written by drummer Ian Wallace. Referring to his drum part in &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Wallace writes, &quot;I really like what I&#x27;m doing, so much so, that I might have to steal it back from myself!&quot;

<text>King Crimson On Broadway is a live album (2-CD set) by the band King Crimson, released through the King Crimson Collectors&#x27; Club in July 1999. The tracks on the albums were recorded at the Longacre Theatre in New York City, New York, US, on November 20, 21, 22, 24 and 25, 1995, as the band was touring to promote the album &quot;THRAK&quot;.

In 2002 King Crimson released a live album (2-CD set) entitled &quot;Vrooom Vrooom&quot; that features one disc with recordings from the Broadway concerts (as well as one disc with recordings from a concert in Mexico one year later).

The final track, &quot;Fearless and Highly THRaKked&quot;, is also featured on the live album &quot;THRaKaTTaK&quot; (1996). An alternative version of this track, entitled &quot;Biker Babes of the Rio Grande&quot;, is featured on the &quot;Vrooom Vrooom&quot; live album (2001).

Lead singer and guitarist Adrian Belew performed The Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; as a solo piece throughout the Broadway engagement. This was not included on &quot;King Crimson On Broadway&quot;, but was released on Belew&#x27;s solo album Belewprints and on the &quot;Vrooom Vrooom&quot; live album.

The liner notes include entries from Robert Fripp&#x27;s web-diary, entered between March 4 and April 22, 1999.

<text>The Night Watch is a live album (2-CD set) by the English rock band King Crimson, recorded in Amsterdam in 1973, and released in 1997.

==Contents==
This album contains an important performance in King Crimson&#x27;s career, being the source of the improvisations &quot;Trio&quot; and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, the Fripp instrumental &quot;Fracture&quot; and the intro to the song &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, all of which were included, with some editing, in the 1974 album &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;. Prerecorded excerpts of &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot; appear at the end of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; similarly to what was included at the beginning of &quot;USA&quot;.

==Production==
The concert was performed on 23 November 1973 at the 
Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Most of the concert was also broadcast live by the BBC and taped by listeners; bootlegs of the broadcast circulated among fans. The concert began with a version of &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic (Part I)&quot;, a recording of which has never been found. Some bootlegs claim to have it but these are recordings from other sources. It was one of the first releases of archival recordings by Discipline Global Mobile, the music company founded by Robert Fripp.

==Art==
Like the covers of many King Crimson albums, &quot;The Night Watch&quot;&#x27;s cover features a painting by P. J. Crook, which is also entitled &quot;The Nightwatch&quot;. The sleeve was designed by the Bill Smith Studio of London.

<doc id="993725" wikidata="Q2195271" url="?curid=993725" title="USA (King Crimson album)">
<text>USA is a live album by the English progressive rock band King Crimson, released in 1975. It was recorded at the Casino, Asbury Park, New Jersey, on 28 June 1974, except “21st Century Schizoid Man”, which was recorded at the Palace Theatre, Providence, Rhode Island, United States, on 30 June 1974. Violin and electric piano overdubs by Eddie Jobson were recorded at Olympic Studios, London in 1975.

The live recording was performed by George Chkiantz and David Hewitt using the Record Plant Remote Truck. 

“Asbury Park” and “Easy Money” were edited to about half their original lengths for the LP release. The unedited versions were released digitally on dgmlive.com in 2005, along with the rest of the show in original running order.

The album opens with a brief excerpt of &quot;The Heavenly Music Corporation&quot; from &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot;, an album Robert Fripp recorded with musician and producer Brian Eno. While it was not listed as a separate track on the original album, it is present on all releases. 

Jobson plays violin on “Larks’ Tongues in Aspic (Part II)” and “21st Century Schizoid Man”, and Fender electric piano on “Lament” to improve the poor sound quality of the original parts played by David Cross. 

Original vinyl releases contain audio content in both the lead-in grooves to both sides of the album, and in side two&#x27;s run-out groove. In the latter case, the audience&#x27;s applause following &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; continues through side two&#x27;s final locked groove, causing the applause to continue on manual turntables as long as the phonograph needle remains on the record.

There have been four releases of the album:
# Original vinyl release in 1975. Includes tracks 1 - 6 (although track 1 &amp; 2 are combined) with Eddie Jobson&#x27;s overdubs.
# 30th Anniversary Remaster released 2002. Added tracks 8 &amp; 9 to original release, credited track 1.
# 2005 mix of original multi-track tapes by Ronan Chris Murphy at DGM. Released as download from dgmlive.com in 2005 and on CD as disc two of The Collectable King Crimson Vol. 1 in 2006. This edition is now the full Asbury Park concert, without overdubs, and in the proper running order. Includes all tracks, with the uncut versions of &quot;Asbury Park&quot; and &quot;Easy Money&quot;; &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; is moved to be the last track and is now the version from Asbury Park rather than Providence, Rhode Island. Does not include Eddie Jobson&#x27;s overdubs.
# 2013 mix by original multi-track tapes by Robert Fripp, Tony Arnold and David Singleton at the Courthouse, Cranborne, Dorset. Same track order and versions as release #3. Splits improv at end of track 6 into its own track. This mix is available on The Road to Red and the 40th Anniversary edition of USA.

==Cover==

The cover is a photograph by British fashion photographer and film director Willie Christie, who also photographed the cover of the Fripp &amp; Eno &quot;No Pussyfooting&quot; album. The idea for the cover came from Wetton and was inspired by the Statue of Liberty.

<doc id="993727" wikidata="Q960364" url="?curid=993727" title="Earthbound (King Crimson album)">
<text>Earthbound is a live album by the band King Crimson, released in June 1972 as a budget record shortly after the line-up that recorded it had broken up. It contains the band&#x27;s first official live release of their signature song &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, and an extended live version of their 1970 non-LP B-side &quot;Groon&quot;. It also contains two improvised tracks with scat vocals from Boz Burrell.

The album&#x27;s sound quality is relatively poor, because of being recorded onto cassette tape (a low-fidelity recording medium, even by 1972 standards) by live sound engineer Hunter MacDonald. The liner notes to the original LP cover and recent CD reissues of the album state that it was &quot;captured live on an Ampex stereo cassette fed from a Kelsey Morris custom built mixer ... in the rain from the back of a Volkswagen truck.&quot; Atlantic Records, the original distributor for King Crimson in the United States and Canada, declined to release &quot;Earthbound&quot; because of its poor sound. Because of the origins of the masters, the sound could not be significantly improved on later CD reissues of the album.

An expanded CD-DVD version of the album was released on 13 November 2017. The CD is expanded to twelve tracks, whereas the DVD features hi-res audio of the album along with much additional audio material including a live radio session in surround sound.

==Content==
In his book &quot;A New Day Yesterday: UK Progressive Rock &amp; the 70s&quot; (2020), Mike Barnes describes &quot;Earthbound&quot; as a &quot;rather ropey sounding&quot; document of the harder-edged performances that King Crimson played on their US tour subsequent to &quot;Islands&quot; (1971). Fripp uses the wah-wah pedal on &quot;Earthbound&quot;, despite otherwise not using the effect because – as he said in a 1974 interview – it &quot;bores [him] intensely&quot; if used conventionally. &quot;Earthbound&quot; (also known as &quot;Orlando&quot;) and &quot;Peoria&quot; are essentially jams centred on two chords. On &quot;Groon&quot;, Ian Wallace&#x27;s drum kit is processed through a EMS VCS 3 synthesiser operated from the mixing desk by live sound engineer Hunter MacDonald, an effect that Barnes opines &quot;must have sounded amazingly new in 1971, [even if it] now comes over as something very much of its time.&quot;

==Release==
Released on 11 June 1972, &quot;Earthbound&quot; was priced at the low cost of £1.35. Fripp said: &quot;It didn&#x27;t cost us very much to make, so it seems reasonable it shouldn&#x27;t cost anybody else much to listen to. It&#x27;s a very earthbound album, it has a lot of energy and a lot of vitality. It&#x27;s not very spiritual, not like the first Crimson album which was magic, it reflects exactly where the band was at during the American tour.&quot; Fripp commented that &quot;Earthbound&quot; is &quot;on a completely opposite plain&quot; from the Walli Elmlark album he was working on by the time the King Crimson album saw release, but added &quot;I don&#x27;t have any difficulty moving from one to the other — it&#x27;s a question of balance. One can&#x27;t produce an earthbound King Crimson album and remain on a particularly esoteric level.&quot; At one point, it was the seventh best-selling album in Britain, according to the &quot;Sounds&quot; chart.

In a 1974 &quot;Trouser Press&quot; interview, Fripp said that &quot;&quot;Earthbound&quot; wasn&#x27;t King Crimson&quot;, deeming it the band&#x27;s &quot;own bootleg&quot; and adding that it was released &quot;to show why the band broke up&quot;. Ira Robbins of the magazine commented that it &quot;showed what, maybe, American touring was like&quot; and highlighted it sounding like &quot;an awful bootleg&quot;. In 1975, Fripp repeated the claim that &quot;&quot;Earthbound&quot; isn&#x27;t a Crimson album&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Earthbound&quot; was released on CD for the first time, alongside the subsequent live record &quot;USA&quot; (1975).

==Legacy==

In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (2003), Chris Dinsdale writes that &quot;Earthbound&quot; &quot;distinguished itself only by being one of the most poorly recorded live albums ever.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) names it a &quot;mediocre live album&quot; that, as a representation of this lineup of King Crimson in concert, had since been supplanted by the &quot;much-superior&quot; &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; (2002). Jon Young of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; calls it &quot;wretchedly unlistenable&quot;, while Chris Salewicz of &quot;Let It Rock&quot; quips: &quot;One of the titles on &quot;Earthbound&quot; is &#x27;Groon&#x27;. Replace the second vowel with an &#x27;a&#x27; and the album is summed up.&quot;

More favourably, Chris Jones of BBC Online named &quot;Earthbound&quot; perhaps King Crimson&#x27;s most atypical album. Noting the infamy of its &quot;utterly non-digital genesis&quot; as a cassette-recorded album, Jones believes that &quot;its &#x27;official bootleg&#x27; ambience sits strangely in the canon of a band infamous for their sonic precision. The truth is that at this point Fripp had hooked up with a bunch of musicians who, as he once put it, loved to &#x27;blow&#x27;. Improvisation, always a key part of Crimson&#x27;s modus operandi, here becomes &#x27;jamming&#x27;.&quot; Jones believes that &quot;Peoria&quot; is the closest King Crimson ever got to funk, chiefly due to Collins&#x27; sax and Burrell&#x27;s scat singing, and considers &quot;Groon&quot; to be &quot;one of the most adventurous things [the band] ever attempted&quot;. Jones considers the overall album to be &quot;a snapshot of a touring band primarily having fun.&quot;

Lindsay Planer of AllMusic believes that what the album lacks in fidelity is &quot;more than compensated for with raw, unrelenting energy and magnetic musicianship.&quot; Planer adds that the &quot;quartet&#x27;s strength as improvisational members of a cohesive central unit are amply displayed throughout every sonic twist and turn.&quot;. Dan Nooger of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; recommends the album to those who are interested in hearing a &quot;goodly portion&quot; of the tour it was recorded on, in which King Crimson &quot;rewarded us with furious pure music of almost unbearable intensity.&quot; &quot;Discoveries&quot; writer Chris Nickson writes that on &quot;Earthbound&quot;, &quot;King Crimson had certainly gone for the physical&quot;, but believed that its cheap price was justified &quot;given its appalling sound.&quot; Commenting on the music, Nickson commented: &quot;It had its moments, especially on the truly apocalyptic take on &#x27;21st Century Schizoid Man,&#x27; but overall [it exhibits] a much funkier, earthier departure from Crimson&#x27;s flights of fancy.&quot;

In a 1997 interview, noise artist Merzbow credited &quot;Earthbound&quot; as an influence, and covered some of its songs without vocals in what he called &quot;brutal arrangements&quot;. He has since named it an early inspiration, and in 1999 said that &quot;Earthbound&quot; &quot;still [sounds] stimulating even today. It is a great Noise album. When I first heard it, it sounded just incredible. You could say that album is a way-out great hard rock album as well.&quot; In a 2014 list for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Mika Vainio from the group Pan Sonic named &quot;Earthbound&quot; among his thirteen favourite albums, crediting it for helping him discover a wealth of jazz and progressive rock. Vainio adds that while the album is &quot;famous for bad sound quality&quot;, it works for the album fantastically, adding that &quot;the sound quality really introduced me to the beauty of distortion. The recording quality is a really important part of the record. The performances are really great also.&quot;

<text>Pellestrina is an island in northern Italy, forming a barrier between the southern Venetian Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea, lying south west of the Lido.

The island is long and has since the eighteenth century been bounded to its seaward side by large embankments. There are four main villages: San Pietro in Volta, Porto Secco, Sant&#x27; Antonio di Pellestrina and Pellestrina, known for their colourfully-painted houses.

The main industries of the island are market gardening, fishing, tourism and lace making. Like that in Chioggia but unlike that in Torcello, the local lace is made with a needle. Attractions on the island included the Lido of Ca&#x27; Roman, known for its pine trees and birdlife.

==In fiction==
Donna Leon&#x27;s crime fiction novel &quot;A Sea of Troubles&quot; (2001) takes place on Pellestrina. The protagonist, Commissario Guido Brunetti of the Venice police, must solve the murders of two clam fishermen off the shore of Pellestrina and encounters great difficulty conducting an investigation when faced with the island&#x27;s close-knit community, bound together by a code of loyalty and a suspicion of outsiders. Though a native of Venice, which is a short boat ride away, to the islanders he is a foreigner.

Cenzo Vianelli, the hero of &quot;The Girl from Venice&quot; (2016), a novel written by Martin Cruz Smith, lives and works as a fisherman in Pellestrina in 1945.

<text>James Gibson (born December 23, 1976) is an American retired professional wrestler better known by the ring name Jamie Noble. He is signed to WWE as a producer. In addition to his work with WWE, Noble is known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling, New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Ring of Honor.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1995–1999)===
Gibson was trained to wrestle by Dean Malenko and Bill Weaver. He debuted on the independent circuit in 1995.

===World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001)===

In 1999, Gibson joined World Championship Wrestling. After training at the WCW Power Plant, he made his first appearance with the promotion on July 11, 1999, under the ring name &quot;Jamie Howard&quot;, teaming with Jet Jaguar in a loss to CG Afi and Jeremy Lopez in a dark match at Bash at the Beach. He made his televised debut on the September 28, 1999, episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, defeating Alan Funk. He went on to perform in the promotion&#x27;s cruiserweight division.

In February 2000, Gibson was renamed &quot;Jamie-San&quot; and reintroduced to WCW television as a member of the East Asian stable Jung Dragons, with Gibson wearing a mask to conceal the fact that he was Caucasian. The stable was made up of Gibson, Jimmy Yang, Kaz Hayashi and their valet, Leia Meow. Throughout mid-2000, The Jung Dragons feuded with rival stable 3 Count. Gibson made his pay-per-view debut at New Blood Rising on August 13, 2000, with The Jung Dragons losing to 3 Count in a double ladder match.

In November 2000, Gibson left The Jung Dragons and formed a tag team with former 3 Count member Evan Karagias. Gibson removed his mask and adopted the ring name &quot;Jamie Knoble&quot;, with he and Karagias performing as &quot;Noble and Courageous&quot;. Noble and Courageous feuded with the remaining members of The Jung Dragons and 3 Count. Gibson continued to wrestle for WCW until the promotion was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2004)===
Upon the acquisition of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment) in March 2001, Gibson was one of the WCW wrestlers to be signed by the WWF. He was assigned to the WWF developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association for seasoning, where he won the HWA Cruiserweight Championship under the Jamie Knoble name.

Knoble debuted on the main WWE roster on the June 6, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by attacking The Hurricane and was joined by Nidia in a trailer park trash gimmick. The spelling of his ring name was tweaked to &quot;Jamie Noble&quot; a few weeks afterwards. He won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Hurricane at King of the Ring and feuded with Tajiri and Billy Kidman. Noble held the title for 147 days until he lost the title to Billy Kidman at Survivor Series on November 17, 2002. Noble then got an inheritance, making both Nidia and Noble rich. Noble and Nidia both turned face by befriending Torrie Wilson and Billy Gunn. Nidia finally left him after she was &quot;blinded&quot; by then-heel Tajiri&#x27;s black mist. He became a heel again by doing things he thought Nidia could not see (mainly using her as a human shield) and lied to her about them. During that time he also feuded with Rey Mysterio for the Cruiserweight Championship. The two would face off for the Championship and Noble lost. A Boyfriend vs. Girlfriend Blindfold Match was then scheduled for Noble and Nidia at No Way Out. Noble came out on top after cheating to see where Nidia was. At WrestleMania XX, Noble competed in the Cruiserweight Open for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship which was won by Chavo Guerrero. On the Sunday Night Heat before The Great American Bash, Noble lost to Spike Dudley. He left WWE on September 15, 2004, when his steroid usage came to light following a staph infection. Gibson was then released from his contract at his request to take some time off.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2004–2005)===
Upon leaving WWE, Gibson began performing under his birth name. In September 2004, he began wrestling for the Japanese promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with American Dragon. He made his final appearance with NJPW in February 2005.

===Ring of Honor (2005)===
In February 2005, Gibson began wrestling for Ring of Honor. While in ROH he wrestled in Hawaii on June 25 and 26, 2005, on the debut shows of new promotion Action Zone Wrestling (AZW) wrestling AJ Styles both nights. He lost the first night in Waianae and won on the second night in Honolulu. On August 12, 2005, Gibson defeated CM Punk, Samoa Joe and Christopher Daniels in an elimination four-way match to win the ROH World Championship. He held the championship until September 17, 2005, when he was defeated by Bryan Danielson. Gibson made his final appearance with Ring of Honor in October 2005, rejoining WWE shortly thereafter.

===Return to WWE (2005–present)===
====Various storylines (2005–2009)====
Noble made his return to WWE on the December 17, 2005, episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; and would later frequently team up with fellow cruiserweight Kid Kash; during June 2006, Noble and Kash debuted a gimmick, where they wore dog collars, and barked and bit and had a short face run. The pair quickly turned heel and were soon named &quot;The Pitbulls&quot;. They then entered the hunt for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The Pitbulls disbanded after Kash was fired from WWE on September 27, 2006.
In 2007, Noble returned to competing in the cruiserweight division and performing as an enhancement talent against Rey Mysterio and Bobby Lashley. At No Way Out, Noble competed in a cruiserweight Gauntlet Match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. He was eliminated by his former WCW teammate, Jimmy Wang Yang.

Noble returned to television on the June 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero and Daivari against Paul London, Brian Kendrick and Wang Yang in a losing effort. On the June 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Noble competed in a Fatal Four-Way number one contenders match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which he lost to Jimmy Wang Yang and also involved Shannon Moore and Daivari. In July, Noble was unsuccessful in a triple threat match for the Cruiserweight Championship against then Champion Guerrero and Funaki. Noble then competed in the Cruiserweight Open at The Great American Bash but was pinned by Hornswoggle. Noble would then begin a feud with Hornswoggle that would see him lose in various humiliating fashions, usually by countout. Moore would constantly use his obsession with Hornswoggle to humiliate him as well.

After his feud with Hornswoggle ended, Noble began an angle where he was easily defeated in his matches as punishment for being disrespectful to then-SmackDown! general manager, Vickie Guerrero. He was eventually placed in a match with Chuck Palumbo, which was expected to be yet another squash. Noble, however, defeated Palumbo, which began a feud between the two, as well as involving Palumbo&#x27;s &quot;friend&quot; Michelle McCool. After his fourth win against Palumbo he came out when Chuck threatened to hurt McCool. Later in a tag team match, Palumbo attacked Noble and McCool, becoming a heel in the process. As a result of the double turn, Noble became a face character once again.
As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Noble was drafted to the Raw brand. Noble was then involved in a storyline where he tried to impress Layla on multiple occasions only to antagonize and be beaten by larger opponents. He started a feud with William Regal over the course of the storyline, with the two trading wins, and Layla, between them. On the September 15, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the feud escalated following Noble&#x27;s victory over Paul Burchill. Layla came out and told Noble it was over and she found a man worthy of her in Regal.

On the February 3 episode of &quot;ECW&quot; Noble asked then-ECW General Manager Theodore Long for an ECW contract and lost to The Boogeyman.

On the February 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Noble suffered a neck injury in a match with Mike Knox, and was taken to a local hospital. His injury meant that the scheduled segment between Chris Jericho and Ricky Steamboat that was meant to take place in the ring, had to take place on the stage instead. It was later confirmed that the injury was not severe. Noble made his return about one month later.

During a match with Sheamus on the November 2, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Noble sustained a back injury after falling from the top rope onto the concrete floor. On November 10, 2009, Noble announced he was retiring from professional wrestling due to the effects of the injury and several other nagging injuries sustained over his career.

==== Producer and J&amp;J Security (2009–present) ====
Upon retiring, Noble began working as a producer. He made occasional appearances on WWE programming and wrestled sporadically at house shows, including a bout with World Heavyweight Champion at the time Daniel Bryan on January 13, 2012.

On the September 29, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Noble and fellow producer Joey Mercury aligned themselves with the villainous stable The Authority. They were later named &quot;J&amp;J Security&quot;, with Noble and Mercury acting as bodyguards to Authority member Seth Rollins. On the November 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Noble, along with Mercury, would wrestle their first televised matches in several years, when they teamed up with Rollins in a 3-on-2 Handicap match against John Cena and Dolph Ziggler in a losing effort. On the February 5, 2015, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, J&amp;J Security once again teamed with Rollins, this time in a 3-on-1 handicap match against Daniel Bryan, once again in a losing effort. After weeks of tension between Rollins and The Authority, on the June 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, J&amp;J Security stood up to Rollins, leaving him, before defeating Rollins in a 2-on-1 Handicap match following interference from Dean Ambrose. However, on the June 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Rollins apologized to The Authority for his behaviour and Brock Lesnar returning and attacking him, J&amp;J Security and Kane would help Rollins attack Lesnar. Noble would legitimately suffer three broken ribs from Lesnar after being thrown into the barricade during the brawl. On the July 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Brock Lesnar viciously attacked J&amp;J Security, whom an afraid Rollins sent to the ramp with Mercury to stop him from getting his hands on Rollins by confronting him near their (J&amp;J Security&#x27;s) new Cadillac, which Rollins had just given them as a gift of his appreciation the previous week. Noble was promptly beaten down by Lesnar and locked into a Kimura Lock submission maneuver. Following this, it was announced that both Noble and Mercury would be out of action indefinitely.

In 2017, Noble was seen backstage at Great Balls of Fire assisting Raw General Manager Kurt Angle with the rescue of Braun Strowman who had been trapped in an ambulance due to Roman Reigns crashing into it with a truck, following their ambulance match. On the May 28, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Noble helped Seth Rollins walk after he was attacked by Elias. He has been involved as a security team member, in numerous pull-apart brawls on &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; throughout 2018 and 2020. On the May 29, 2020, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Noble was among officials on the scene following a hit-and-run on Elias and found a seemingly inebriated Jeff Hardy, who was then arrested. On the March 12, 2021, episode of &quot;Smackdown&quot;, Noble was seen shielding Cesaro from Rollins who attacked him.

On December 11, 2022, during the WWE Holiday Tour in Charleston, West Virginia, Noble made a one-night-only return to competition. In his final match, Noble teamed with Braun Strowman and The Brawling Brutes (Ridge Holland and Butch) against The Bloodline (The Usos, Solo Sikoa and Sami Zayn). Noble picked up the victory after hitting the Gibson driver on Zayn.

==Personal life==
Gibson attended Baileysville High School in Baileysville, West Virginia, where he met his future wife, Angela England. The couple have a son, Gage, and a daughter, Paige. He has since been remarried to Sasha Gibson and relocated to Florida. He has two half brothers, Cody and Dale.

On September 28, 2016, Gibson was stabbed twice outside of his West Virginia home and was hospitalized after an alleged dispute with a driver. On October 5, 2016, it was revealed that he had a collapsed lung from the stabbing.

<text>Andrew Stewart MBE (30 December 1933 – 11 October 1993) was a Scottish singer and entertainer. He presented the BBC TV variety show &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; throughout the 1960s, and his song &quot;Donald Where&#x27;s Your Troosers?&quot; was a hit in both 1960 and 1989. Internationally, the song most closely associated with Stewart is &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stewart was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1933, the son of a teacher. When he was five years old, the family moved to Perth and then, six years later, to Arbroath. Even in early childhood, he loved imitating people and amazed his parents with impersonations of famous singers and actors. He attended Arbroath High School, where his father taught science.

In 1950, at the age of 16, he participated in the Arbroath Abbey Pageant, taking the part of &quot;A Knight in Shining Armour&quot;. Up until this time, he had not thought seriously about a career in entertainment, as he had aspirations of becoming a veterinary surgeon. He then decided to train as an actor at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, where he studied until 1954. During his first year at the college, he obtained First Prize for Comedy; he also excelled in fencing, particularly at the foil.

==Career==
Stewart&#x27;s patriotic wearing of tartan and his use of stereotypical Scottish humour throughout the 1960s, echoed the music hall style and songs of fellow Scot Sir Harry Lauder.

Stewart himself attributed his &quot;breakthrough&quot; onto the international stage to the success of his &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot; recording, which became a no. 1 hit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, spent 40 weeks in the UK Singles Chart (1961), reached no. 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and also achieved hit status in South Africa and India. His other international hit singles included &quot;Come in-Come in&quot;, &quot;Donald Where&#x27;s Your Troosers?&quot;, &quot;Campbeltown Loch&quot;, &quot;The Muckin&#x27; O&#x27; Geordie&#x27;s Byre&quot;, &quot;The Road to Dundee&quot;, &quot;The Battle&#x27;s O&#x27;er&quot; (No. 1 on the Australian charts in July 1961), &quot;Take Me Back&quot;, &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Finlay&quot; (1965). He is also remembered for being the compere of &quot;The White Heather Club&quot;. This was a BBC Scotland television programme that existed as an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve party (1957–1968), and also as a weekly early-evening series (1960–1968). At the height of its popularity, the show had a viewership of 10 million.

&quot;Donald Where&#x27;s Your Troosers?&quot; was a hit in late 1960 and again when reissued in 1989. Stewart is said to have written the song in 10 minutes as he sat, minus trousers, in the lavatory of a recording studio. Stewart included an Elvis Presley impersonation halfway through the song. On the strength of this comedy hit, Stewart toured Australia and appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1968, doing impersonations of Dean Martin. His skill with different accents is also evident on &quot;The Rumour&quot;, where the rumour moves across Scotland and into Ireland, with Stewart speaking in a different accent for each place. Stewart&#x27;s stage shows often included his impersonations of other famous singers, including Tom Jones, Billy Eckstine, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin, Johnnie Ray, Elvis Presley, Petula Clark and Johnny Cash.

His albums, such as &quot;Scottish Soldier&quot;, &quot;The Best of Andy Stewart&quot; and &quot;Andy Stewart&#x27;s Scotland&quot;, were also popular internationally. In 1973 he recorded a &quot;live&quot; album in Johannesburg, South Africa, entitled &quot;Andy Stewart in South Africa – White Heather Concert&quot;, which also featured accordionist Jimmy Blue, singers Alexander Morrison and Anna Desti and pianist Mark Simpson.

His international appeal was well-illustrated by his appearance at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, attended by many thousands of people. From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, he frequently and successfully toured Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand. He appeared in concert throughout South Africa in 1968, 1971 and 1973. He also performed in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong. Coming out of retirement in 1991, he began tours at home and abroad once again.

A prolific lyricist, he penned words to many traditional Scottish tunes, e.g. &quot;Green Hills of Tyrol&quot; (which he called &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot;), &quot;The Black Bear&quot; (&quot;Tunes of Glory&quot;), and &quot;The Battle is Over&quot; (&quot;The Battle&#x27;s O&#x27;er&quot;). He wrote his first lyric at the age of 14 (to a tune composed by his father) and called the song &quot;My Hameland&quot;, which in 1969 (21 years later) became the title track of one of his albums.

Stewart took part in the 1961, 1962 and 1978 Royal Variety Performances and also appeared for the royal family at a Christmas party at Windsor Castle.

&quot;Scotch Corner&quot;, a Scottish television series (1972–1976) featured Andy Stewart and various guest singers and musicians. Some of the artists included in these broadcasts accompanied Stewart on his international White Heather concert tours during the 1970s. &quot;Andy&#x27;s Party&quot; was another popular TV series on Grampian Television in the late 1970s.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

From 1973 onward, recurrent ill-health took its toll on his voice and stage vitality. Frequently hospitalised in the 1970s and 1980s, he underwent several heart and stomach operations, including triple heart bypass surgery in 1976 and again in 1991.

==Retirement and death==
In retirement, he moved back to Arbroath. &quot;Donald Where&#x27;s Your Troosers&quot; was a surprise hit when reissued in late 1989. Marketed as a novelty song ideal for Christmas parties, it was actively promoted by BBC Radio One DJ Simon Mayo and reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. In response, Stewart provided a jingle for Mayo, &quot;Simon, where&#x27;s your troosers?&quot;.

Coming out of retirement in 1991, he began touring once again and recorded two CDs on the Scotdisc label. In 1993 a summer season at the Capitol Moat House Hotel in Edinburgh was cut short because of a back injury. A further long season for the following year was planned at the same venue. Shortly before he died in 1993, he gave a small concert at Arbroath High School for the pupils. He was also due to appear in The &quot;Pride of the Clyde&quot; at Glasgow&#x27;s Pavilion Theatre and other tours and concerts were planned. A sheltered housing scheme in Arbroath, &#x27;Andy Stewart Court&#x27;, was named in his memory.

Stewart died the day after a performance at a Gala Benefit Concert for Children&#x27;s Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) at Usher Hall in Edinburgh. Stewart suffered a fatal heart attack at his home. Stewart&#x27;s funeral took place at St Andrew&#x27;s Church (Church of Scotland) in Arbroath on Friday 15 October. His family were joined by many stars and friends from the entertainment world. A large crowd gathered outside the church to pay their respects to &quot;The Tartan Trooper&quot;, while a piper played &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot; and &quot;The Battle&#x27;s O&#x27;er&quot;.

==Awards and family==
Stewart was awarded an MBE in 1976. He received the Freedom of Angus in 1987.

His son Ewan Stewart is an actor, whose film and television credits include &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;River City&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s grandson Harris Beattie played the title role of Billy Elliot in the eponymous West End production. In 2017 Harris won the prestigious Royal Academy of Dance Gold medal at the Genée International Ballet Competition and currently is a dancer with Northern Ballet based in Leeds. Another grandson, Alistair Beattie, toured internationally as a dancer in Matthew Bourne&#x27;s, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (2018-2020).

<text>James Elroy Flecker (5 November 1884 – 3 January 1915) was a British novelist, playwright, and poet, whose poetry was most influenced by the Parnassian poets.

==Biography==

Herman Elroy Flecker was born on 5 November 1884 in Lewisham, London, to William Herman Flecker, headmaster of Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and his wife Sarah. His much younger brother was the educationalist Henry Lael Oswald Flecker, who became Headmaster of Christ&#x27;s Hospital.

Flecker later chose to use the first name &quot;James&quot;, either because he disliked the name &quot;Herman&quot; or to avoid confusion with his father. &quot;Roy&quot;, as his family called him, was educated at Dean Close School, and then at Uppingham. He subsequently studied at Trinity College, Oxford, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. While at Oxford he was greatly influenced by the last flowering of the Aesthetic movement there under John Addington Symonds, and became a close friend of the classicist and art historian John Beazley.

From 1910 Flecker worked in the consular service in the Eastern Mediterranean. On a ship to Athens he met Hellé Skiadaressi, and they were married in 1911.

Flecker died on 3 January 1915, of tuberculosis, in Davos, Switzerland, and was buried in Bouncer&#x27;s Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham. His death at the age of thirty was described at the time as &quot;unquestionably the greatest premature loss that English literature has suffered since the death of Keats&quot;.

Hellé Flecker settled in England. She edited &quot;Flecker&#x27;s Letters: Some Letters from Abroad of James Elroy Flecker&quot;, published by Heinemann in 1930 &quot;with a few reminiscences by Hellé Flecker&quot;. In 1935, she was awarded a government pension of £90 a year &quot;in recognition of the services rendered by her husband to poetry&quot;. Hellé Flecker survived her husband for more than 45 years, dying in Sunbury-on-Thames in October 1961.

==&quot;Hassan&quot;==

Flecker&#x27;s poem &quot;The Golden Journey to Samarkand&quot; was published in 1913, but only found its larger context when his play, &quot;Hassan&quot;, was published. 

&quot;Hassan&quot; (&quot;The Story of Hassan of Bagdad and How He Came to Make the Golden Journey to Samarkand&quot;) is a five-act drama in prose with verse passages. It tells the story of Hassan, a young man from Baghdad who embarks on a journey to Samarkand, a city in Central Asia. Along the way, he encounters various challenges and obstacles, including bandits, treacherous terrain, and political turmoil.

&quot;Hassan&quot; was not staged in Flecker’s lifetime, and was published posthumously in 1922. The play premiered in a sumptuous production directed by Basil Dean at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London on 20 September 1923. Henry Ainley played Hassan, with Leon Quartermaine, Malcolm Keen, Esme Percy, Cathleen Nesbitt, Basil Gill and Laura Cowie in the cast. The incidental music was by Frederick Delius and conducted by Eugène Goossens. The ballets were devised by Michel Fokine, and George W. Harris designed the sets &amp; costumes. Delius was in the audience. Percy Fletcher conducted the music after the second performance, and recorded a selection of numbers from the production with the orchestra and chorus of His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in November 1923.

The production included incidental music, songs, dances, and choral episodes. It caught the fancy of English audiences at the time, perhaps because of the escape implied in its exotic setting and a post-war vogue for oriental imagery, and its wistful ending of death, by execution, and a hoped for reunion and love in the afterlife, a theme that would have resonated for the survivors of the Great War, remembering those who died in the war. Delius&#x27;s atmospheric music also contributed to the success of the production.

==Works and influence==

Flecker&#x27;s life and works were the subject of &quot;Life of James Elroy Flecker&quot;, a biography by Geraldine Hodgson published in 1925, relying on letters and other material provided by Flecker&#x27;s mother. She summarised his contribution as &quot;singular in our literature&quot;. However, this comment and her book received a damning review in &quot;The Calendar&quot;, which called it &quot;sentimental and prudish... conceited and irrelevant&quot;.

A character in the second volume of Anthony Powell&#x27;s novel sequence, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, is said to be &quot;fond of intoning&quot; the lines &quot;For lust of knowing what we should not know / We take the Golden Road to Samarkand&quot;, without an attribution to Flecker. (This is in fact a misquotation, the original reads &quot;...what should not be known&quot;).

Saki&#x27;s short story &quot;A Defensive Diamond&quot; (in &quot;Beasts and Super-Beasts&quot;, 1914) references &quot;The Golden Journey to Samarkand&quot;.

Agatha Christie quotes Flecker several times, especially in her final novel, &quot;Postern of Fate&quot; (1973). &quot;Pass not beneath, O Caravan, or pass not singing. Have you heard
That silence where the birds are dead yet something pipeth like a bird?&quot;

Jorge Luis Borges quotes a quatrain from Flecker&#x27;s poem &quot;To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence&quot; in his essay &quot;Note on Walt Whitman&quot; (available in the collection &quot;Other Inquisitions, 1937–1952&quot;):

Nevil Shute quotes from &quot;Hassan&quot; in &quot;Marazan&quot; (1926), his first published novel, and in the headings of many of the chapters in his 1951 novel &quot;Round the Bend&quot;.

The Pilgrims&#x27; Song from &quot;Hassan&quot; and its setting by Delius play a pivotal role at the beginning of Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s novel &quot;The Castle on the Hill&quot; (1942).

Tracy Bond quotes an amended stanza from &quot;Hassan&quot; in the 1969 film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; as she looks out of the window of Piz Gloria at the sun rising over the Swiss alps:

The original in Flecker&#x27;s play is more romantic, and makes clear that the Caliph is being addressed, not the Almighty:
In &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; (1973), author George MacDonald Fraser concludes a final scene with a decasyllable quatrain pastiche in Flecker’s style. Following many misadventures suffered by the book’s picaresque hero Harry Flashman, brother-in-arms rebel leader Yakub Beg waxes poetic and evokes the mystique of middle Asia with its concomitant voyage of self-discovery and friendships hard-won by reciting:

Flecker&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bridge of Fire&quot; features in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series, in the volume &quot;The Wake&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Journey to Samarkand&quot; is quoted in the volume &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;.

In Vikram Seth&#x27;s &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot;, the young English Literature lecturer Dr Pran Kapoor attempts to reduce colonial influence in the syllabus and suggests removing Flecker (to make room for James Joyce). Professor Mishra disagrees and quotes from &quot;The Gates of Damascus&quot;

The excerpt from Flecker&#x27;s verse drama &quot;Hassan ... the Golden Journey to Samarkand&quot;) inscribed on the clock tower of the barracks of the British Army&#x27;s 22 Special Air Service regiment in Hereford provides an enduring testimony to Flecker&#x27;s work:

The same extract appears on the Special Air Service Memorial in Herefordshire the New Zealand Special Air Service monument at Rennie Lines in the Papakura Military Camp in New Zealand, and at the Indian Army&#x27;s Special Forces Training School in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh, India.

<text>Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi (1 January 1906 – 15 April 1974) was an Italian songwriter.

== Biography ==

D&#x27;Anzi was born in Milan. In 1935 he wrote music and lyrics of &quot;O mia bela Madonina&quot; (&quot;My beautiful little Madonna&quot;), a song dedicated to his hometown which soon became very popular and a sort of unofficial city anthem.

Between the 1930s and 1950s Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi and Alfredo Bracchi formed a very prolific pair of songwriters. They worked for radio, cinema and theater productions. Several of their songs were great hits. Among them &quot;Ma le gambe&quot;, &quot;Bambina innamorata&quot;, &quot;Ma l&#x27;amore no&quot;, &#x27;Voglio vivere così&#x27;, &quot;Ti parlerò d&#x27;amor&quot;. His song &quot;Malinconia d&#x27;amore&quot; has been sung by both Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras.

Most of their songs were in Milanese dialect, and described ironically characters of the past in Milan, for example &quot;La gagarella del Biffi Scala&quot; (the spoiled daughter of Mr Biffi Scala) and &quot;El Tumiami de Luret&quot; (the braggart from piazzale Loreto), &quot;El Biscella&quot; (the silly-bully boy).

During the 1960s Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi retired from the musical scene. He moved to Liguria and took up painting.

He died at Santa Margherita Ligure. Milan&#x27;s local authorities included him in the list of important Milanese people at the Monumental Cemetery in the Civico Mausoleo Palanti.

In 1990 to his memory a plaque was hung in Galleria del Corso in Milan, in front of the place where he worked and near where he lived, the plaque reads &quot;once upon a time in this gallery there was a king: Giovanni D&#x27;anzi, he wrote magic notes, and the sweetest serenade he sang for Milan : Oh mia bela Madonina &quot;

In his memory, since 1995, the Gruppo Editoriale Curci under the auspices of the Comune di Milano and the association &quot; Amici della musica e dello spettacolo &quot; organizes the annual Award Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi, singing event in Milanese dialect. The presenter is Tony Martucci historical event, with Liliana Feldmann in the years 1992 and 1993, with Roberta Potrich in the years 2004 and 2005.

<text>The Sambre () is a river in northern France and in Wallonia, Belgium. It is a left-bank tributary of the Meuse, which it joins in the Wallonian capital Namur.

The source of the Sambre is near Le Nouvion-en-Thiérache, in the Aisne department. It passes through the Franco-Belgian coal basin, formerly an important industrial district. The navigable course begins in Landrecies at the junction with the Canal de la Sambre à l&#x27;Oise, which links with the central French waterway network (or did, until navigation was interrupted in 2006 following structural failures). It runs 54 km and 9 locks 38.50m long and 5.20m wide down to the Belgian border at Jeumont. From the border the river is canalised in two distinct sections over a distance of 88 km with 17 locks. The Haute-Sambre is 39 km long and includes 10 locks of the same dimensions as in France, down to the industrial town of Charleroi. The rest of the Belgian Sambre was upgraded to European Class IV dimensions (1350-tonne barges) in the immediate post-World War II period. It lies at the western end of the sillon industriel, which is still Wallonia&#x27;s industrial backbone, despite the cessation of all the coal-mining and a decline in the steel industry. The river flows into the Meuse at Namur, Belgium.

The navigable waterway is managed in France by Voies Navigables de France and in Belgium by the Service Public Wallon - &quot;Direction générale opérationnelle de la Mobilité et des Voies hydrauliques&quot; (Operational Directorate of Mobility and Inland Waterways)

== Course ==
The Sambre flows through the following departments of France, provinces of Belgium and towns:
* Aisne (F): Barzy-en-Thiérache
* Nord (F): Landrecies, Aulnoye-Aymeries, Hautmont, Maubeuge
* Hainaut (B): Thuin, Montigny-le-Tilleul, Charleroi
* Namur (B): Floreffe, Namur

==Main tributaries==
==Events==
* On 24 February 1912, Regina Magritte, the mother of the famous surrealist painter Réné Magritte, drowned herself in this river at Châtelet.

==Battles==
The 19th-century theory that the Sambre was the location of Julius Caesar&#x27;s battle against a Belgic confederation (57 BC), was discarded a long time ago, but is still repeated.

Three important battles were fought in Fleurus, a suburb of Charleroi on the north bank of the Sambre: the Thirty Years&#x27; War Battle of Fleurus (1622), the Nine Years&#x27; War Battle of Fleurus (1690), and the crucial 26 June 1794 Battle of Fleurus (1794), the most significant battle of the Flanders Campaign in the Low Countries during the French Revolutionary Wars. The last was fought on both banks of the river, culminating a campaign that had involved multiple crossings and re-crossings of the river.

Heavy fighting occurred along the river during World War I, especially at the siege of Namur in 1914 (Battle of Charleroi) and in the last month of the war Battle of the Sambre (1918).

<text>S. Barry Barnes (born 27 March 1943) was Professor of Sociology at the University of Exeter.

Barnes worked at the &#x27;Science Studies Unit&#x27; at the University of Edinburgh with David Bloor from the 1970s through the early 1990s, where they developed the strong programme in the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge. He moved to the sociology department in Exeter in 1992. Barnes is known for his naturalistic approach to science, a view elaborated in his book &quot;Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory&quot; (1974). He advocated a post-Kuhnian approach to scientific knowledge, and suggested that philosophers, historians and other researchers study scientific practice in a variety of fields as cultural traditions whose development could be given causal explanations. In this view conceptual change in normal science is a process unfolding through expert debate and negotiation. This latter perspective was developed in &quot;T. S. Kuhn and Social Science&quot; (1982).

<text>Nina Kiriki Hoffman (born March 20, 1955, in San Gabriel, California) is an American fantasy, science fiction and horror writer.

==Profile==

Hoffman started publishing short stories in 1975. Her first nationally published short story appeared in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine in 1983. She has since published over 200 in various anthologies and magazines.

Her short story &quot;A Step Into Darkness&quot; (1985) was one of the winners of the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future award and was published in the first of the &quot;Writers of the Future&quot; anthologies.

Her second collection of short stories, &quot;Courting Disasters and Other Strange Affinities&quot;, was nominated for the 1992 Locus Award for best collection of the year.

Her novella &#x27;&quot;Unmasking&quot;, published in 1992 by Axolotl Press, was a finalist for the 1993 World Fantasy Award. Her novella &quot;Haunted Humans&quot; (seen in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, July 1994) was a finalist for the 1995 Nebula Award for Best Novella and on the same ballot her novelette &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot; was shortlisted for the Nebula Award for Best Novelette. Her short story &quot;Trophy Wives&quot; won the 2008 Nebula Award for Best Short Story.

Her first novel, &quot;The Thread That Binds the Bones&quot;, won the Bram Stoker Award for first novel. Other novels include &quot;The Silent Strength of Stones&quot; (a sequel to &quot;Thread&quot;), &quot;A Fistful of Sky,&quot; and &quot;A Stir of Bones&quot;. Her best known works are set in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California, and involve people (often entire families) with magical talents. The stories have invited comparison to Zenna Henderson and Ray Bradbury&#x27;s stories on similar themes.

She has been shortlisted, awarded and finalist for awards for novella, novelette, novel, fantasy novel, adult literature, work for younger readers, young adult books, and children&#x27;s literature for the Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, the HOMer award from CompuServe, the Endeavour Award, the Mythopoeic Award, the James Tiptree Jr. Award and the Philip K. Dick Award.

Her brother is the musician Kristian Hoffman.

She lives in Eugene, Oregon. She is a member of the Wordos writers&#x27; group. In 2017, she competed in the SLUG Queen pageant in the persona of country singer &quot;Patsy Slugtana&quot;.

As of 2020, she teaches small classes in science fiction, fantasy, and horror writing via Zoom for the Fairfield County Writers&#x27; Studio.

<doc id="993774" wikidata="Q38615" url="?curid=993774" title="Clicker training">
<text>Clicker training is a positive reinforcement animal training method based on a bridging stimulus (the clicker) in operant conditioning. The system uses conditioned reinforcers, which a trainer can deliver more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term &quot;clicker&quot; comes from a small metal cricket noisemaker adapted from a child&#x27;s toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior. When training a new behavior, the clicker helps the animal to quickly identify the precise behavior that results in the treat. The technique is popular with dog trainers, but can be used for all kinds of domestic and wild animals.

Sometimes, instead of a click to mark the desired behavior, other distinctive sounds are made (such as a &quot;whistle, a click of the tongue, a snap of the fingers, or even a word&quot;) or visual or other sensory cues (such as a flashlight, hand sign, or vibrating collar), especially helpful for deaf animals.

==History==

B. F. Skinner first identified and described the principles of operant conditioning that are used in clicker training. Two students of Skinner&#x27;s, Marian Kruse and Keller Breland, worked with him researching pigeon behavior and training projects during World War II, when pigeons were taught to &quot;bowl&quot; (push a ball with their beaks). They believed that traditional animal training was being needlessly hindered because methods of praise and reward then in use did not inform the animal of success with enough promptness and precision to create the required cognitive connections for speedy learning. They saw the potential for using the operation conditioning method in commercial animal training. The two later married and in 1947 created Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), &quot;the first commercial animal training business to intentionally and systematically incorporate the principles of behavior analysis and operant conditioning into animal training.&quot;

The Brelands coined the term &quot;bridging stimulus&quot; in the 1940s to refer to the function of a secondary reinforcer such as a whistle or click. ABE continued operations until 1990, with the assistance of Bob Bailey after Keller Breland died in 1965. They report having trained over 15,000 animals and over 150 species during their time in operation. Their positive methods contrasted with traditional training using aversives such as choke chains, prong collars, leash snapping, ear pinching, “alpha-rolling,” the shock collar, elephant goad, cattle prods, and elephant crushing.

Although the Brelands tried to promote clicker training for dogs in the 1940s and 1950s, and the method had been used successfully in zoos and marine mammal training, the method failed to catch on for dogs until the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, animal trainers Karen Pryor and Gary Wilkes started giving clicker training seminars to dog owners. In 1998, Alexandra Kurland published &quot;Clicker Training For Your Horse,&quot; which rejected horse training that uses aversives such as horsebreaking and the use of the spur, bit (horse), crop (implement), and longeing with a horsewhip By the 1990s, many zoos used clicker training for animal husbandry because with this method, they did not have to use force or medication. They could be moved to different pens or given veterinary treatments with much less stress on the animals. In the 21st century, training books began to appear for other companion animals, such as cats, birds, and rabbits (See &quot;Further Reading&quot;).

==Method==

The first step in clicker training is teaching the animal to associate the clicker sound (or other chosen marker such as a whistle) with a treat. Every time the click sounds, a treat is offered immediately.

Next the click is used to signal that a desired behavior has happened. Some approaches are:
*capturing: catching the animal in the act of doing something that is desired, for example sitting or lying down. Eventually the animal learns to repeat the behavior for a treat.
*shaping: gradually building a new behavior by rewarding each small step toward it.
*luring: using the treat like a magnet to get the animal to move toward the desired position.

Once the behavior is learned, the final step is to add a cue for the behavior, such as a word or a hand signal. The animal will have learned that a treat is on the way after completing the desired behavior.

The basis of effective clicker training is precise timing to deliver the conditioned reinforcer at the same moment as the desired behaviour is offered. The clicker is used as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by &quot;luring&quot;, where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by &quot;shaping&quot;, where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by &quot;capturing&quot;, where the dog&#x27;s spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded. Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.

== Punishment or aversives ==
Clicker training teaches wanted behaviors by rewarding them when they happen, and not using punishments, according to dog trainer Jonathan Philip Klein.

Clicker training uses almost entirely positive reinforcements. Some clicker trainers use mild corrections such as a &quot;non reward marker&quot;; an &quot;Uh-uh&quot; or &quot;Whoops&quot; to let the dog know that the behaviour is not correct, or corrections such as a &quot;Time out&quot; where attention is removed from the dog. Alexander continues:

Some credit trainer Gary Wilkes with introducing clicker training for dogs to the general public, but behavioral psychologist Karen Pryor was the first to spread the idea with her articles, books (including &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot the Dog&quot;) and seminars. Wilkes joined Pryor early on before going solo. Wilkes writes that &quot;No method of training is &#x27;all positive.&#x27; By scientific definition, the removal of a desired reward is a &#x27;negative punishment.&#x27; So, if you ever withhold a treat or use a time-out, by definition, you are a &#x27;negative&#x27; trainer who uses &#x27;punishment. where &quot;negative&quot; indicates that something has been removed and &quot;punishment&quot; merely indicates there has been a reduction in the behavior (unlike the common use of these terms).

<doc id="993776" wikidata="Q4254120" url="?curid=993776" title="Laowai">
<text>Laowai is the Pinyin pronunciation/transliteration of (pinyin: &quot;lǎowài&quot;,  &quot;old foreign&quot;), an informal term or slang for &quot;foreigner&quot; and/or non-Chinese national, usually neutral but possibly impolite or loose in some circumstances. Formal and polite Chinese terms for foreigner include &quot;wàiguórén&quot; (), &quot;wàibīn&quot; (), &quot;guójì yǒurén&quot; ) and &quot;wàiguó pengyou&quot; (). &quot;Laowai&quot; is commonly used to refer to foreigners of non-Asian ethnicities. The term usually does not refer to ethnic Han of non-Chinese citizenship or other Asian ethnicities.

==Etymology==

The use of the word began in the 1980s, likely as an abbreviation of the term (foreigner) into plus the prefix .

As characters and words, &quot;lǎo&quot; means &quot;old; senior; aged&quot;; &quot;wài&quot; means &quot;out; outside; external; outer&quot;, and by extension various meanings including &quot;appearance; faraway; distant; non-local; foreign; informal; other; unorthodox&quot;.

 is a common colloquial prefix of respect (partly out of the value of seniority conferred), its use dating back to some of the earliest Mandarin vernacular records. In Mandarin, the prefix is well-established enough that it is now inseparably fixed in many words, where its original meaning is lost. For example, &quot;lǎoshī&quot; &quot;teacher&quot; is composed of &quot;lǎo&quot; and &quot;shī&quot; &quot;teacher&quot;, and the original word for &quot;teacher&quot; &quot;shī&quot; cannot be used alone. Other examples include &quot;lǎotiānyé&quot; &quot;(Lord of) Heavens&quot;, &quot;lǎoxiāng&quot; &quot;fellow townspeople&quot;, &quot;lǎohǔ&quot; &quot;tiger&quot;, and even &quot;lǎoshǔ&quot; &quot;mouse&quot;, an animal traditionally despised for its cultural character as well as its significant damages to humans.

In its active use, the prefix &quot;lǎo&quot; is most often added to surnames to show respect in informal registers towards anyone not definitively young. This is often contrasted to another prefix &quot;xiǎo&quot; &quot;small; little; young&quot;, which, added to surnames, shows closeness and friendly affection in informal registers towards anyone more junior and at least slightly younger than the speaker. Another much less common and rather restricted use is attaching to a descriptor to mark such a person, with a slightly humorous undertone. For example, &quot;lǎowángù&quot; &quot;a stubborn one&quot; is composed from &quot;wángù&quot; &quot;stubborn&quot;.

The associations of the prefix can be positive, indicating age or experience—such as &quot;lǎopéngyou&quot; ()—or respect, as in the familiar use of &quot;lǎo&quot; to denote the senior and respected members of families or to address teachers (, &quot;lǎoshī&quot;). It may also be used in combination with part of a person&#x27;s name (usually the family name) to refer to that person in a familiar and respectful way (for example a person with the surname 周, or Zhōu, could be referred to as 老周, literally &quot;Old Zhōu&quot;). This usage is reserved exclusively for adults, but implies familiarity rather than seniority, and is often attached to specific individuals as a nickname rather than being freely used.

However, in certain restricted contexts, it can also carry negative connotations of being old or aged looking (), boring old —as in &quot;lǎo gǔdǒng&quot; ()—or of years of experience and contempt—as in &quot;lǎo dōngxi&quot; (, &quot;old thing&quot;). It may be used in the arts or in jokes with the sense of &quot;always&quot; or &quot;very&quot;: a famous comedy role was named the &quot;Lǎoniān&quot; (老蔫, &quot;Constantly Listless&quot;). As a pun with &quot;lǎoshī&quot; &quot;teacher&quot;, , Tom Hardy was affectionately known in mainland China as &quot;Lǎoshī&quot; (  ; Constantly Wet) partly for his perpetually shiny hair.

The character has come to be used for specific nationality as well, with &quot;lǎo-&quot; functioning as a colloquial equivalent for &quot;-guórén&quot;: &quot;lǎoměi&quot; (), &quot;lǎomò&quot; (); even &quot;lǎozhōng&quot; () to refer to Chinese () themselves.

==Informality of the term==
The term is not considered necessarily offensive by those who choose to use it, but it may become so from context (tone, manner, situation, etc.). Among the Chinese, the term is informal and may be used in a neutral, genial, or even good-humored way. Varyingly, it is ironically embraced, begrudgingly accepted, openly resented or not minded at all among the Western expatriate community.

The official Chinese press has expressed concern about inappropriate use of laowai and avoids it in all formal reporting.

Mark Rowswell, known under the stage name Dashan, is one of the most famous Western nationals in China&#x27;s media industry and has admitted a place for the term. However, he recognizes it as pejorative and stated that &quot;it is the foreigners [in China] who can&#x27;t speak any Chinese who are truly &#x27;laowai&#x27;&quot; (). Many take that as implying that the term laowai is one that many, including Dashan himself, would prefer to avoid.

Editorials, written by Chinese and non-Chinese, have appeared in English- and Chinese-language newspapers about the subject, particularly around the time of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, when Chinese governments launched campaigns aimed at curbing use of the term in possibly-offensive situations.

<doc id="993791" wikidata="Q152857" url="?curid=993791" title="Downfall (2004 film)">
<text>Downfall () is a 2004 historical war drama film written and produced by Bernd Eichinger and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. It is set during the Battle of Berlin in World War II, when Nazi Germany is on the verge of total defeat, and depicts the final days of Adolf Hitler (portrayed by Bruno Ganz). The cast includes Alexandra Maria Lara, Corinna Harfouch, Ulrich Matthes, Juliane Köhler, Heino Ferch, Christian Berkel, Alexander Held, Matthias Habich, and Thomas Kretschmann. The film is a German-Austrian-Italian co-production.

Principal photography took place from September to November 2003, on location in Berlin, Munich, and Saint Petersburg, Russia. As the film is set in and around the , Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors&#x27; memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books &quot;Inside Hitler&#x27;s Bunker&quot; by historian Joachim Fest and &quot;Until the Final Hour&quot; by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler&#x27;s secretaries, among other accounts of the period.

The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on 14 September 2004. It was controversial with audiences for showing a human side of Hitler, and for its portrayal of members of the Third Reich. It later received a wide theatrical release in Germany under its production company Constantin Film. The film grossed over $92million. Critics gave favourable reviews, particularly for Ganz&#x27;s performance as Adolf Hitler and Eichinger&#x27;s screenplay. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
In 1942, Adolf Hitler invites several young women to interview for the position of personal secretary at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair on the Eastern Front. Traudl Junge is overjoyed when he chooses her.

In April 1945, the Red Army has pushed Germany&#x27;s forces back in the ensuing Battle of Berlin. On Hitler&#x27;s 56th birthday, the shelling of Berlin&#x27;s city centre starts. &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler tries to persuade Hitler to leave Berlin, but Hitler refuses. Himmler leaves to negotiate with the Allies secretly. Later, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Hermann Fegelein, Himmler&#x27;s liaison officer at Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, attempts to persuade Hitler to flee, but Hitler insists that he will win or die in Berlin. SS doctor &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Ernst-Günther Schenck is ordered to leave Berlin in Operation Clausewitz but persuades an SS general to let him stay in Berlin. In the streets, Hitler Youth Peter Kranz&#x27;s father approaches his son&#x27;s unit and tries to persuade him to leave. Peter, who destroyed two enemy tanks, denounces his father.

At a meeting in the , Hitler forbids the overwhelmed 9th Army to retreat, instead ordering &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Felix Steiner&#x27;s units alongside Lieutenant General Walther Wenck&#x27;s 12th Army to mount a counter-attack. The generals find the orders impossible and irrational. Above ground, Hitler awards Peter the Iron Cross, hailing him as braver than his generals. In his office, Hitler talks to armaments minister Albert Speer about his scorched earth policy. Speer is concerned about the destruction of Germany&#x27;s infrastructure, but Hitler believes the German people are weak and deserve death. Hitler&#x27;s companion Eva Braun holds a party in the Reich Chancellery, which is interrupted by artillery fire. Her brother-in-law Fegelein tries to persuade Eva to leave Berlin with Hitler, but she refuses.

On the frontline, General Helmuth Weidling is informed he will be executed for allegedly ordering a retreat. Weidling comes to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; to clear himself of the charges. His action impresses Hitler, who promotes him to oversee all of Berlin&#x27;s defences. At another meeting, Hitler learns that Steiner did not attack because his unit lacked sufficient force. Hitler becomes enraged at this and launches into a furious tirade, claiming that everyone has failed him and denouncing his generals as cowards and traitors. He acknowledges that the war is lost but says that he would rather commit suicide than leave Berlin.

&quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke asks Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to stop sending inexperienced soldiers to the battlefront as they are easy prey for the Red Army. Goebbels refuses, claiming that the German people deserve their fate for voting the Nazis into power. Schenck witnesses old men being executed by the &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot; for refusing to fight. Hitler receives a message from &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, requesting state leadership for himself. In response, Hitler declares Göring as committing a coup d&#x27;etat, ordering his dismissal and arrest. Speer makes a final visit to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; and admits that he has defied orders to destroy Germany&#x27;s infrastructure. Hitler, however, does not punish Speer, and lets him leave Berlin. Peter returns to find his unit dead and runs back home. Hitler continues to imagine ways for Germany to turn the tide. At dinner, Hitler learns of Himmler&#x27;s secret negotiations with the Allies, sending him into another rage, and he orders Himmler&#x27;s execution. He discovers that Fegelein has deserted his post and has him executed despite Eva&#x27;s pleas. SS physician &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Ernst-Robert Grawitz asks Hitler&#x27;s permission to evacuate for fear of Allied reprisal. Hitler refuses, leading Grawitz to kill his family and himself using grenades.

The Red Army continues advancing as Berlin&#x27;s supplies run low and German morale plummets. Hitler hopes that even without Steiner, Wenck&#x27;s 12th Army will save Berlin. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Junge before marrying Eva. The following morning, Hitler learns that the 12th Army is unable to save Berlin. Refusing surrender, Hitler plans his death. He administers poison to his dog Blondi, bids farewell to the bunker staff, and commits suicide with Eva. They are cremated with petrol in a ditch in the Chancellery garden.

Goebbels assumes the Chancellorship but immediately decides to commit suicide after General Hans Krebs fails to negotiate a ceasefire with Red Army Colonel General Vasily Chuikov, who still insists on Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender. Goebbels&#x27; wife Magda poisons their six children with cyanide capsules before committing suicide with Goebbels. Many officials and soldiers, including Krebs and German diplomat SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Walther Hewel commit suicide as well after learning of Germany&#x27;s defeat. Weidling announces the unconditional surrender of German forces in Berlin not long before Peter discovers that his parents were murdered by a band of Nazi fanatics. The remaining occupants of the bunker attempt to flee the city but soon end up surrounded by the Red Army. Junge is the only occupant who continues her escape, and Peter joins her as they sneak through Red Army soldiers before finding a bicycle and escaping Berlin.

The Goebbels children are portrayed by Alina Sokar (Helga), Charlotte Stoiber (Hilda), Gregory Borlein (Helmut), Julia Bauer (Hedda), Laura Borlein (Holde), and Amelie Menges (Heide).

==Production==
===Development===
Producer and screenwriter Bernd Eichinger wanted to make a film about Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party for twenty years but was, at first, discouraged after its enormity prevented him from doing so. Eichinger was inspired to begin the filmmaking process after reading &quot;Inside Hitler&#x27;s Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich&quot; (2002) by historian Joachim Fest. Eichinger also based the film on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler&#x27;s secretaries, called &quot;Until the Final Hour: Hitler&#x27;s Last Secretary&quot; (2002). When writing the screenplay, he used the books &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; (1969), by Albert Speer, one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials; &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Last Days: An Eye-Witness Account&quot; (1973), by Gerhard Boldt; &quot;Das Notlazarett unter der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin&quot; (1995) by Ernst-Günther Schenck; and &quot;Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949&quot; (1992) by Siegfried Knappe as references.

After completing the script for the film, Eichinger presented it to director Oliver Hirschbiegel. Though he was interested in exploring how the people of Germany &quot;could have plumbed such depths&quot;, as a German, Hirschbiegel hesitated to take it as he &quot;reacted to the idea of Nazism as a taboo&quot;. Hirschbiegel eventually agreed to helm the project.

===Casting===
When Bruno Ganz was offered the role of Hitler, he was reluctant to accept the part, and many of his friends advised against it, but he believed that the subject had &quot;a fascinating side&quot;, and ultimately agreed to take the role.
Ganz studied the Hitler and Mannerheim recording for four months to properly mimic Hitler&#x27;s conversational voice and Austrian dialect. Ganz came to the conclusion that Hitler had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, noting his observation of Hitler&#x27;s shaky body movements present in the newsreel &quot;Die Deutsche Wochenschau&quot;, and decided to visit a hospital to study patients with the disease. Ganz auditioned in the casting studio with makeup for half an hour and tested his voice for Hirschbiegel who was convinced by his performance.

Alexandra Maria Lara was cast as Traudl Junge; she was given Junge&#x27;s book &quot;Until the Final Hour&quot; (2002), which she called her &quot;personal treasure&quot;, to read during filming. Before she was cast, she had seen André Heller&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Im toten Winkel&quot; which impressed her and influenced her perspective on Junge.

===Filming and design===
Principal photography lasted twelve weeks from September to November 2003, under the working title &quot;Sunset&quot;. The film is set mostly in and around the ; Hirschbiegel made an effort to accurately reconstruct the look and atmosphere of World War II through eyewitness accounts, survivors&#x27; memoirs, and other historical sources. Hirschbiegel filmed in the cities of Berlin, Munich, and Saint Petersburg, Russia, with a run-down industrial district along the Obvodny Canal used to portray the historical setting in Berlin. Hirschbiegel noted the depressing atmosphere surrounding the shoot, finding relief through listening to Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s music. Alexandra Maria Lara also mentioned the depressing and intense atmosphere during filming. To lighten the mood, Lara&#x27;s colleagues engaged in activities such as football, while Ganz tried to keep a happy mood by retiring during shooting breaks.

The film was produced on a €13.5million budget. The bunker and Hitler&#x27;s Wolf&#x27;s Lair were constructed at Bavaria Studios in Munich by production designer Bernd Lepel. The damaged Reich Chancellery was depicted through the use of CGI. Hirschbiegel decided to limit the use of CGI, props and sets so as not to make the set design look like that of a theatre production, explaining:
==Themes==
According to Eichinger, the film&#x27;s overlying idea was to make a film about Hitler and wartime Germany that was very close to historical truth, as part of a theme that would allow the German nation to save their own history and &quot;experience their own trauma&quot;. To accomplish this, the film explores Hitler&#x27;s decisions and motives during his final days through the perspective of the individuals who lived in the Führerbunker during those times. Eichinger chose not to include mention of the Holocaust because it was not the topic of the film. He also thought it was &quot;impossible&quot; to show the &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;desperation&quot; of the concentration camps cinematically.

===Portrayal===
During production, Hirschbiegel believed that Hitler would often charm people using his personality, only to manipulate and betray them. Many of the people in the film, including Traudl Junge, are shown to be enthusiastic in interacting with Hitler instead of feeling threatened or anxious by his presence and authority. The production team sought to give Hitler a three-dimensional personality, with Hirschbiegel telling NBC: &quot;We know from all accounts that he was a very charming mana man who managed to seduce a whole people into barbarism.&quot; He said Hitler was &quot;like a shell&quot;, attracting people with self-pity, but inside the shell was only &quot;an enormous will for destruction&quot;.

The film explores the suicides and deaths of the Nazi Party as opposed to the people who choose life. Hitler&#x27;s provision of cyanide pills to those in the bunker and the Goebbels&#x27; murder of their children are shown as selfish deeds while people such as Schenck, who chose to help the injured and escape death, are shown as rational and generous. In the DVD commentary, Hirschbiegel said that the events in the film were &quot;derived from the accounts, from descriptions of people&quot; in the bunker. The film also includes an introduction and closing with the real Junge in an interview from &quot;Im toten Winkel&quot;, where she admits feeling guilt for &quot;not recognizing this monster in time&quot;. While the majority of the characters in the film are based on actual people, the character Peter Kranz is fiction as he is based on Alfred Czech, a 12-year-old who saved a dozen of German soldiers from a Russian attack in his home village of Goldenau (now Złotniki, Poland). The character&#x27;s name may be different, but the scene is real.

==Release==
&quot;Downfall&quot; premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 14, 2004. After first failing to find a distributor, the film was eventually released on September 16 in Germany by Constantin Film. It premiered in the U.S. in Manhattan on February 18, 2005, under Newmarket Films. On its broadcast in the UK, Channel4 marketed it with the strapline: &quot;It&#x27;s a happy ending. He dies.&quot;

===Box office and awards===
&quot;Downfall&quot; sold nearly half a million tickets in Germany for its opening weekend and attracted 4.5 million viewers in the first three months. The final North American gross was $5,509,040, while $86,671,870 was made with its foreign gross. The film made $93.6million altogether.

&quot;Downfall&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards. It won the 2005 BBC Four World Cinema competition. The film was also ranked number 48 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD in August 2 2005 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Shout! Factory released a collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray in March 2018, with a &quot;making-of&quot; featurette, cast and crew interviews, and audio commentary from director Oliver Hirschbiegel. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in Germany in 2024.

===TV Extended Version===
In addition to the theatrical version, which has a length of 150 minutes, there was also an extended version produced especially for television. First aired by Das Erste on 19 October 2005, the 25 minutes longer Extended Version was played in two parts each with a length of approx. 90 minutes. Later it was also released on DVD. The Extended Version features many new scenes in the bunker and shows more of the bombed-out Berlin.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 141 reviews from critics, with a weighted average of 8/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Downfall&quot; is an illuminating, thoughtful and detailed account of Hitler&#x27;s last days.&quot; On Metacritic, the film was awarded the &quot;Must-See&quot; badge, holding a weighted average of 82 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Reviews for the film were often very positive, despite debate surrounding the film from critics and audiences upon its release . Ganz&#x27;s portrayal of Hitler was singled out for praise; David Denby for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that Ganz &quot;made the dictator into a plausible human being&quot;. Addressing other critics like Denby, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert said the film did not provide an adequate portrayal of Hitler&#x27;s actions, because he felt no film could, and that no response would be sufficient. Ebert said Hitler was, in reality, &quot;the focus for a spontaneous uprising by many of the German people, fueled by racism, xenophobia, grandiosity and fear&quot;.

Hermann Graml, history professor and former Luftwaffe helper, praised the film and said that he had not seen a film that was &quot;so insistent and tormentingly alive&quot;. Graml said that Hitler&#x27;s portrayal was presented correctly by showing Hitler&#x27;s will &quot;to destroy, and his way of denying reality&quot;. Julia Radke of the German website Future Needs Remembrance praised the film&#x27;s acting and called it well crafted and a solid &quot;Kammerspielfilm&quot;, though it could lose viewer interest due to a lack of concentration on the narrative perspective. German author Jens Jessen said that the film &quot;could have been stupider&quot; and called it a &quot;chamber play that could not be staged undramatically&quot;. Jessen also said that it was not as spectacular as the pre-media coverage could have led one to believe, and it did not arouse the &quot;morbid fascination&quot; the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; was looking for.

Hitler biographer Sir Ian Kershaw wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the film had enormous emotive power, calling it a triumph and &quot;a marvellous historical drama&quot;. Kershaw also said that he found it hard to imagine anyone would find Hitler to be a sympathetic figure in his final days. Wim Wenders, in a review for the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, said the film was absent of a strong point of view for Hitler which made him harmless, and compared &quot;Downfall&quot; to &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, stating that in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; the viewer would know which character was evil.

=== Humanization concerns ===

&quot;Downfall&quot; was the subject of dispute by critics and audiences in Germany before and after its release, with many concerned regarding Hitler&#x27;s portrayal in the film as a human being with emotions in spite of his actions and ideologies. The portrayal sparked debate in Germany due to publicity from commentators, film magazines, and newspapers, leading the German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; to ask the question, &quot;Are we allowed to show the monster as a human being?&quot;

It was criticized for its scenes involving the members of the Nazi party, with author Giles MacDonogh criticizing the portrayals as being sympathetic towards SS officers Wilhelm Mohnke and Ernst-Günther Schenck, the former of whom was accused of murdering a group of British prisoners of war in the Wormhoudt massacre. At a discussion in London, Hirschbiegel said that the allegations that Schenck had performed unethical medical experiments were unproven. Russian press visited the set, making the producers uneasy and occasionally defensive. Yana Bezhanskay, director of Globus Film, Constantin&#x27;s Russian partner, raised her voice to Russian journalists and said: &quot;This is an antifascist film and nowhere in it do you see Hitler praised.&quot;

Cristina Nord from &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; criticized the portrayal, and said that though it was important to make films about perpetrators, &quot;seeing Hitler cry&quot; had not informed her on the last days of the Third Reich. Some have supported the film: Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, director of &quot;&quot; (1977), felt the time was right to &quot;paint a realistic portrait&quot; of Hitler. Eichinger replied to the response from the film by stating that the &quot;terrifying thing&quot; about Hitler was that he was human and &quot;not an elephant or a monster from Mars&quot;. Ganz said that he was proud of the film; though he said people had accused him of &quot;humanizing&quot; Hitler.

When Rochus Misch, Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard from 1940, was asked about the film&#x27;s historical accuracy in a 2005 interview, he stated that although it was factually accurate, the film had “Americanized” what had happened in real life. He noted that Hitler never screamed in the bunker and that the bunker was generally quiet. Misch opined that the film portrayal of the murder of the Goebbels children was inaccurate as he alleged that it was Frau Goebbels who was behind the murder as opposed to both Frau and Joseph Goebbels. Furthermore, whilst Misch had contemplated suicide as depicted in the film, the event occurred differently in reality.

==Parodies==


&quot;Downfall&quot; is well known for its rise in popularity due to many internet parody videos and memes which use several scenes in the film: when Hitler phones &quot;General der Flieger&quot; Karl Koller about Berlin&#x27;s April 20 bombardment; when Hitler discusses a counterattack against advancing Soviet forces with his generals; where Hitler becomes angry after hearing that Steiner&#x27;s attack never happened, due to a lack of forces; when Hitler hears Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring&#x27;s telegram; when Hitler is having dinner and discovers &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler secretly made a surrender offer to the Western Allies; and where Hitler orders Otto Günsche to find &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Hermann Fegelein. In the videos the original German audio is retained, but new subtitles are added so that Hitler and his subordinates seem to be reacting to an issue or setback in present-day politics, sports, entertainment, popular culture, or everyday life. In addition, some users combine footage from the film with other sources, dub the German dialogue over video games and/or footage from other films and TV series, or edit images of the characters onto pre-existing or animated footage, often for greater comic effect. 

Hirschbiegel spoke positively about these parodies in a 2010 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, saying that many of them were funny and a fitting extension of the film&#x27;s purpose. Nevertheless, Constantin Film asked video sites to remove them. The producers initiated a removal of parody videos from YouTube in 2010. This prompted more posting of parody videos of Hitler complaining that the parodies were being taken down, and a resurgence of the videos on the site.

One particular parody was the subject of &quot;BP Refinery v Tracey&quot;, in Australia, where a BP employee named Scott Tracey was terminated from his job for a video satirising collective bargaining negotiations at the company he was working in. Tracey managed to successfully appeal his unfair dismissal to the Full Federal Court who decided that the video in question was not offensive, and had his job reinstated and received $200,000 in compensation.

<text>Harry Collins, FLSW (born 13 June 1943), is a British sociologist of science at the School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University, Wales. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales.

== Career ==
While at the University of Bath Professor Collins developed the Bath School approach to the sociology of scientific knowledge.

In &quot;Changing Order: Replication and Induction in Scientific Practice&quot;, Collins outlines a general theory of sociology of science. Drawing from the concepts of &quot;Language Game&quot; and &quot;Forms of Life&quot;, derived from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, he seeks an explanation for how scientists follow rules and patterns when performing experiments and scientific practice. Collins&#x27; perspective is usually called a relativist position, although this is a strong oversimplification.

Collins has written for over 30 years on the sociology of gravitational wave physics. His publications in this area include: &quot;The Seven Sexes: Study in Sociology of a Phenomenon, or Replication of Experiments in Physics&quot; &quot;Son of Seven Sexes: The Social Destruction of a Physical Phenomenon&quot;. He has traced the search for gravitational waves, and has shown how scientific data can be subject to interpretative flexibility, and how social or &#x27;non-scientific&#x27; means can be sometimes used to close scientific controversies.

At the beginning of the 2000s, Collins along with Dr Robert Evans, also of Cardiff University, has published works on what they term the &quot;Third Wave of Science Studies&quot; and, in particular, the idea of interactional expertise. This aims to address questions of legitimacy and extension and public involvement in scientific decision-making. They continue to research and publish on this topic.

<text>Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court decision that dealt with the effective assistance of counsel during a criminal trial.

==Background==
Before his trial for murder, the defendant, Whiteside, discussed his planned testimony with his attorney, and said that he had seen &quot;something metallic in [the victim&#x27;s] hand&quot;, in contradiction to earlier statements that he had not seen a gun in the victim&#x27;s hand. Whiteside&#x27;s attorney, Robinson, had warned that he (Robinson) would have an ethical obligation to report perjured testimony to the court. Whiteside, on the stand, admitted that while he believed the victim had a gun, he did not actually see a gun in the victim&#x27;s hand. Whiteside was convicted, and subsequently applied for a federal writ of habeas corpus, on the grounds that his conviction was tainted under the Sixth Amendment in that his attorney&#x27;s threat to disclose the perjury had deprived Whiteside of effective assistance of counsel.

==Supreme Court decision==
The Court ruled unanimously that Whiteside had not been deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Burger, stated that an attorney&#x27;s duty to his client&#x27;s cause is &quot;limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth&quot;, and that &quot;the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury&quot;.

Concurrences by Justices Blackmun, Brennan and Stevens stated that Whiteside had failed to show that the attorney&#x27;s actions had caused prejudice to the defendant&#x27;s trial required to sustain a claim of &quot;ineffective representation&quot;, as required by the case of &quot;Strickland v. Washington&quot;, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).

In a separate concurrence, Justice Brennan said that the Court is deciding only the narrow issue &quot;conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment&quot; (quoting the lower court). &quot;Unfortunately, the Court seems unable to resist the temptation of sharing with the legal community its vision of ethical conduct.&quot; But it is up to &quot;the States... how [lawyers] behave in their courts, unless and until federal rights are violated.&quot;
