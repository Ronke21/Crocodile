<doc id="989011" wikidata="Q329823" url="?curid=989011" title="Population pyramid">
<text>A population pyramid (age structure diagram) or &quot;age-sex pyramid&quot; is a graphical illustration of the distribution of a population (typically that of a country or region of the world) by age groups and sex; it typically takes the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. Males are usually shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured in absolute numbers or as a percentage of the total population. The pyramid can be used to visualize the age of a particular population. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species. Number of people per unit area of land is called population density.

==Structure==

A population pyramid often contains continuous stacked-histogram bars, making it a horizontal bar diagram. The population size is shown on the x-axis (horizontal) while the age-groups are represented on the y-axis (vertical). The size of each bar can be displayed either as a percentage of the total population or as a raw number. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right. Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids provide. A great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid, and this can shed light on the extent of development and other aspects of the population.

The measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) should be considered when assessing a population pyramid. For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would be very young compared to one with an average age of 55. Population statistics are often mid-year numbers.

A series of population pyramids could give a clear picture of how a country transitions from high to low fertility rates. If the pyramid has a broad base, this indicates that a relatively high proportion of the population lies in the youngest age band, such as ages 0–14, which suggests that the fertility rate of the country is high and above replacement fertility level. If a population is below replacement fertility level, the older population is declining with age, due to a combination of mortality and an increase in the number of births over time. There are usually more females than males in the older age ranges since, for a variety of reasons, women have a greater life expectancy.

The shape of the pyramid can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a high proportion of children and/or of elderly people have a higher dependency ratio. This ratio refers to how many old and young people are dependent on the working-age groups (often defined as ages 15–64). According to Weeks&#x27; &quot;Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,&quot; population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. Population momentum, when a population&#x27;s birth rates continue to increase even after fertility rate has declined to replacement level, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term doubling time, which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight into the economic status of a country from the age stratification since the distribution of supplies is not evenly distributed through a population.

== Demographic transition ==
In the demographic transition model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and a skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone. In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three, four, and five, while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.

==Types==

Each country will have a different population pyramid. However, population pyramids can be categorised into three types: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.

;&quot;Stationary&quot; pyramid or constant population pyramid
:A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remain approximately constant over time. In a stationary population, the numbers of births and death roughly balance one another.
;&quot;Expansive&quot; pyramid or Expanding population pyramid
:A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with a high birth rate and perhaps low life expectancy therefore leading to high death rate. The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort increases each year. 

;&quot;Constrictive&quot; pyramid or Declining population
:A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom. The population is generally older on average, as the country has long life expectancy, a low death rate, but also a low birth rate. This may suggest that in future there may be a high dependency ratio due to reducing numbers at working ages. This is a typical pattern for a very developed country, with a high level of education, easy access to and incentive to use birth control, good health care, and few negative environmental factors.

==Youth bulge==


Gary Fuller (1995) described a youth bulge as a type of expansive pyramid. Gunnar Heinsohn (2003) argues that an excess in especially young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest, war, and terrorism, as the &quot;third and fourth sons&quot; that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology.

Heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment) and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge. This factor has been also used to account for the Arab Spring events and the rise of extremist populism in the 2010s. Economic recessions, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and the late 2000s Great Recession, are also claimed to be explained in part due to a large youth population who cannot find jobs. Youth bulge can be seen as one factor among many in explaining social unrest and uprisings in society. A 2016 study finds that youth bulges increase the chances of non-ethnic civil wars, but not ethnic civil wars.

A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough – in which case a &#x27;demographic dividend&#x27; accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16–29 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males. In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability. For Cincotta and Doces (2011), the transition to more mature age structures is almost a sine qua non for democratization.

To reverse the effects of youth bulges, specific policies such as creating more jobs, improving family planning programs, and reducing overall infant mortality rates should be a priority.

===Middle East and North Africa===

The Middle East and North Africa are currently experiencing a prominent youth bulge. &quot;Across the Middle East, countries have experienced a pronounced increase in the size of their youth populations over recent decades, both in total numbers and as a percentage of the total population. Today, the nearly 111 million individuals aging between 15 to 29 living across the region make up nearly 27 percent of the region&#x27;s population.&quot; Structural changes in service provision, especially health care, beginning in the 1960s created the conditions for a demographic explosion, which has resulted in a population consisting primarily of younger people. It is estimated that around 65% of the regional population is under the age of 25.

The youth bulge in the Middle East and North Africa has been favorably compared to that of East Asia, which harnessed this human capital and saw huge economic growth in recent decades. The youth bulge has been referred to by the Middle East Youth Initiative as a demographic gift, which, if engaged, could fuel regional economic growth and development. &quot;While the growth of the youth population imposes supply pressures on education systems and labor markets, it also means that a growing share of the overall population is made up of those considered to be of working age; and thus not dependent on the economic activity of others. In turn, this declining dependency ratio can have a positive impact on overall economic growth, creating a demographic dividend. The ability of a particular economy to harness this dividend, however, is dependent on its ability to ensure the deployment of this growing working-age population towards productive economic activity, and to create the jobs necessary for the growing labor force.&quot;

<text>The National University of Sciences &amp; Technology (NUST) () is a Pakistani multi-campus public research university with its main campus in Islamabad, and other campuses in Rawalpindi, Risalpur, Quetta and Karachi. It offers degrees in multiple disciplines e.g. engineering, computer sciences, natural sciences, business studies, humanities, architecture as well as health sciences.

The university offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, including doctoral and professional degrees. NUST was established in March 1991 for the promotion of higher education in the country, especially in the fields of science and technology, and its charter was granted in 1993. The main campus in Islamabad also contains Pakistan&#x27;s first National Science and Technology Park, certified by International Association of Science Parks (IASP).

==History==
The first college to be affiliated with NUST was MCS in 1992. In 1993, the university was granted a charter and CEME and MCE became part of the university. In December 1994 and November 1995, CAE and PNEC became constituents of NUST respectively. All the constituent colleges were upgraded and MS programmes were started at CAE in September 1997. In 1998, MS programmes were started at PNEC and in the same year, Bachelor of Dental Surgery was started at AMC. In 1999, CEME and CAE attained ISO 9001 Certification, the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (SEECS) was launched in Islamabad and NUST Business School (NBS, formerly known as NIMS) was established. School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SMME) offers degrees in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering and is one of the most competitive engineering schools in Pakistan.

As of 2016, NUST has over 15,000 full-time students enrolled and over 20 departments with over 1,280 academic faculty staff. It is ranked by &quot;QS World Ranking&#x27;s&quot; as among the leading 50 universities under the age of 50 and is ranked by QS as among the top 367 universities in the world. It is the number 1 ranked university in Pakistan according to QS World Ranking 2021. It is also ranked by QS as among top 300 in world in Electrical Engineering, and top 500 in Business Studies and Mathematics. While &quot;Times Higher Education Ranking&#x27;s&quot; rank&#x27;s NUST as among the top 100 universities from BRICS and Emerging economies, as among top 120 in Asia and among top 250 globally in the field of Electrical Engineering. In 2016, it was also ranked as among the next 50 leading young universities globally by Time&#x27;s. NUST is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, United Nations Academic Impact and Talloires Network.

NUST is the first model university established by the Ministry of Science and Technology like KAIST of Korea. The student body consists of 7,000+ students, including 102 international students and 884 postgraduate students. In 2015, more than 70,000 candidates applied for the undergraduate program at NUST. NUST has 675 full-time employed faculty staff including 17 members from international universities and many professors and lecturers are a part of visiting faculty of NUST. In addition to this, professors from universities around the world visit NUST under collaborative arrangements.

After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the training of military corpsmen became one of the top priorities of the new Government. In 1947, Military College of Signals was established as the School of Signals. A year later, in 1948, the School of Military Engineering (SME) was established at Sialkot to train the corps in the field of engineering. In 1951, it was given the status of college - Military College of Engineering (MCE)- and was shifted to its present location in Risalpur. On 1 April 1957, EME School was established at Quetta and in 1969, it was given the status of college (CEME) and civilians were admitted. In 1962 PNEC was established in Karachi. To train the members of the Pakistan Air Force, the College of Aeronautical Engineering (CAE) was established at Korangi Creek, Karachi in 1965. In 1976, the College of Medical Sciences was established as the Army Medical College (AMC) and a year later in 1977, the first MBBS course started there. In the same year, the School of Signals was upgraded to a college. In 1981 a BSc program started at CEME giving it the status of a university and a few years later in April 1984 CEME moved to its current location in Rawalpindi from Quetta. In May 1986, CAE was shifted to the PAF Academy in Risalpur.

In 2003, CEME received ISO 9001-2000 certification. In the same year, the Center for Cyber Technology and Spectrum Management was launched in Islamabad. In May 2004, the Center for Advanced Mathematics and Physics was created. A Ph.D. program started at CEME in 2006. In 2007, the Center of Virology and Immunology was developed to increase research in the field of medical sciences in Pakistan. In 2008, a new campus was developed in Islamabad. Some old colleges are being shifted to this campus and new schools are being developed such as School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Chemical and Materials Engineering, School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering and the Research Center for Modeling and Simulation. In 2012, NUST renamed NUST Center of Virology and Immunology as Atta ur Rahman School of Applied Biosciences to honor Prof. Atta ur Rehman. The majority of the faculty members are PhD and M.Phil. professors from universities around the world. A large number of sponsored students and faculty members, doing their PhD abroad, are scheduled to return to NUST from 2008 onwards which will further increase the number of PhD professors in the faculty.

NUST has implemented the Learning Management System (LMS). It offers to its instructors and students an extensive platform to learn and flourish. The best is brought online to make the learning process more efficient and effective. Online learning includes functionalities like course management, file management, user management, user communication, online grading system, offline/online assignment submission and other things related to academics. LMS provides a convenient access to important information related to the different subjects running through the semester. Faculty can create their own courses in which they can manage their course materials and related documents. An overview of course proceedings can be seen with a quick look and the whole semester activities like quizzes, assignments and exams. The system improves continuously with the valuable user&#x27;s feedback which is the backbone of the learning system. In 2015, Course Management System was introduced and is in the phase of development.

<text>Takis Fyssas (, born 12 June 1973) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a left back. After his retirement he served as the sporting director of the Greece national team.

From 1999 to 2007, he earned 60 caps for the Greece national team. He was part of the team which won Euro 2004.

==Club career==

===Panionios===
Fyssas started his career in the Panionios youth academy, achieving his senior debut in the 1990–91 season. After eight seasons in Nea Smyrni, which included a Greek Cup triumph.

===Panathinaikos===
He signed for Athens club Panathinaikos in 1998. The increased exposure Fyssas received playing at the Spiros Louis ensured a rapid elevation to the Greece national side and he made his debut against Finland in 1999. Fyssas also made his first UEFA Champions League appearance while with the &quot;Greens&quot;, in the 2000–01 season.

===Benfica===
In December 2003, he moved to Lisbon with Benfica, where he was to stay for a season and a half, helping Benfica claim the 2003–04 Portuguese Cup and 2004–05 Primeira Liga. On 25 January 2004, he was on the bench for a 1–0 away win against Vitória de Guimarães, a game overshadowed by the sudden death of his teammate Miklós Fehér. He scored a goal on the final of Portuguese Cup that season, that gave them the victory against FC Porto.

===Hearts===
After being allowed to leave Benfica in the summer of 2005, Fyssas made the surprise decision to move to Scotland with the Hearts, despite reported interest from England and Germany. He collected his fourth career winners medal in his first season with the Tynecastle side, when they defeated Gretna in the 2005–06 Scottish Cup final. His first and only Hearts goal came in a league game against Motherwell on 9 December 2006.

<doc id="989022" wikidata="Q3674939" url="?curid=989022" title="China Relief Expedition Medal">
<text>The China Relief Expedition Medal was a decoration of the United States military which was issued to members of both the United States Navy and the United States Marines for service in the China Relief Expedition between 1900 and 1901 during the Boxer Rebellion. The medal was authorized by General Orders of the Department of the Navy on June 27, 1908. General Order 81 established the medal authorized for Naval personnel while General Order 82 authorized the medal for the Marine Corps.

==Description and symbolism==
To be awarded the China Relief Expedition Medal, a service member was required to perform duty within the borders of China as part of the China Relief Expedition. The eligibility dates of the China Relief Expedition Medal were from May 24, 1900 to May 17, 1901. The medal was issued as a one time award and there were no devices authorized for multiple bestowals.

The United States Army equivalent of the China Relief Expedition Medal was the China Campaign Medal.

The ribbon of the Navy and Marine Corps version of the medal originally bore a yellow and black motif. The colors were changed in 1915 to yellow and blue to correspond with those of the U.S. Army medal issued for similar service.

The first 400 medals struck bear the date &quot;1901.&quot; The die in use became damaged and replaced with a re-engraved die. This one, however, had the date &quot;1900&quot; which appears on all subsequent copies.

She has served for four years as a professor and the dean of National College of Arts. She is the eldest daughter of the renowned poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz and his British-born wife Alys Faiz.

She represents the first generation of modern artists in Pakistan who carry an artistic identity different from indigenous artists. She is known for condemning the Pakistani and Indian nuclear programs; she is one of the few Pakistani intellectuals who condemned the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998. She received the Pride of Performance Award in 1999 for her services to the nation.

==Early life and education==
Salima was born in 1942, in before-the-partition New Delhi, India to parents Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Alys Faiz. She is Pakistani. She has one younger sister, Muneeza Hashmi, a senior producer with Pakistan TV. Her mother, Alys Faiz, was a sister of Christobel Taseer, mother of Salman Taseer, the former Governor of Punjab, Pakistan.

Salima migrated with her family to Lahore during the partition of India in 1947 and was raised in Lahore. After studying design at Lahore&#x27;s National College of Arts (NCA), she moved to England in the early 1960s, where she studied at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, receiving a diploma in art education from there in 1965. Salima later studied at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island, and received a MAE degree in 1990.

Salima married a fellow professor Shoaib Hashmi. The couple has two children, son Yasser Hashmi and one daughter Mira Hashmi. Her husband Shoaib Hashmi retired from a teaching position at Government College University, Lahore, and Lahore School of Economics, and was also a popular co-star with her in comedy and children&#x27;s television shows on Pakistan television in the early 1970s - for example the highly popular 1970s children&#x27;s show &#x27;Akkar Bakkar&#x27;.

==Career==

She has served as Dean of the School of Visual Arts &amp; Design at the Beaconhouse National University Lahore, Pakistan. Hashmi was also professor and the head of the National College of Arts. She is famous for her quick wit and ability to read and analyse artwork. She is a respected patron of young artists known to have the capacity to make or break a career. Formerly known as &quot;Art-Shart&quot;, Rohtas-2 is the gallery set up by Hashmi at her house in Lahore Model Town. In recent years she has been working on developing closer links with India and working towards a unity group. Hashmi is a member of Amnesty International, and Pakistan Peace Initiative to India after 2009 Mumbai Attack. She is also vice-chair person (Punjab) Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.

===Arts===
Hashmi is one of the most well-known artists of Pakistan.

In 1999, she received Pakistan&#x27;s &#x27;Pride of Performance for Arts&#x27; award. She also co-founded Lahore&#x27;s &quot;Rohtas 2 Gallery&quot;, an art gallery featuring works of young artists. Salima Hashmi has exhibited her works internationally and she has travelled all over the world and lectured extensively for it. She has organised several international art shows in England, Europe, United States, Australia, Japan and India.

== Political views ==
Hashmi comes from a socially and politically active family. Her father was the communist Pakistani writer, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and her mother, the British-born Alys Faiz was a journalist and peace activist in Pakistan. One of two daughters, Hashmi was always active in the arts, performing in plays before taking on painting professionally.

Salima expressed her frustration at the India and Pakistan nuclear tests by saying, &quot;It would be so much more fruitful if these energies could be used in producing food to eat, providing shelter, freedom from disease and education for all.&quot;

Hashmi was about eight years old when Faiz Ahmed Faiz was imprisoned for his political views. She remembers visiting him in jail. Later, during the repressive years of General Zia-ul-Haq rule, Hashmi&#x27;s father had to go into self-exile as a result of the harassment he faced by Zia&#x27;s government. Therefore, Salima grew up in a politically charged atmosphere. Painting became her outlet.

<doc id="989026" wikidata="Q737823" url="?curid=989026" title="James J. Gibson">
<text>James Jerome Gibson (; January 27, 1904 – December 11, 1979) was an American psychologist and is considered to be one of the most important contributors to the field of visual perception. Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked him as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
James Jerome Gibson was born in McConnelsville, Ohio, on January 27, 1904, to Thomas and Gertrude Gibson. He was the oldest of three children and had two younger brothers, Thomas and William. Gibson&#x27;s father worked for Wisconsin Central Railroad, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Because his father worked on the railroad, Gibson and his family had to travel and relocate quite frequently, moving throughout the Dakotas and Wisconsin until they finally settled down in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette.

When Gibson was a boy, his father would take him out on train rides. Gibson recalled being absolutely fascinated by the way the visual world would appear when in motion. In the direction of the train, the visual world would appear to flow in the same direction and expand. When Gibson looked behind the train, the visual world would seem to contract. These experiences sparked Gibson&#x27;s interest in optic flow and the visual information generated from different modes of transportation. Later in life, Gibson would apply this fascination to the study of visual perception of landing and flying planes.

=== Education and career ===
Gibson began his undergraduate career at Northwestern University, but transferred after his freshman year to Princeton University, where he majored in philosophy. While enrolled at Princeton, Gibson had many influential professors including Edwin B. Holt who advocated new realism, and Herbert S. Langfeld who had taught Gibson&#x27;s experimental psychology course. After taking Langfeld&#x27;s course, Gibson decided to stay at Princeton as a graduate student and pursued his PhD in psychology with Langfeld serving as his doctoral adviser. His doctoral dissertation focused on memory of visual forms, and he received his PhD in 1928.

E. B. Holt, who was taught by William James, inspired Gibson to be a radical empiricist. Holt was a mentor to Gibson. While Gibson may not have directly read William James&#x27; work, E. B. Holt was the connecting factor between the two. Holt&#x27;s theory of molar behaviorism brought James&#x27;s philosophy of radical empiricism into psychology. Heft argues that Gibson&#x27;s work was an application of William James&#x27;. Gibson believed that perception is direct and meaningful. He discussed the meaning of perception through his theory of affordances. Gibson also was influenced by James&#x27; neutral monism, which posits that nothing is solely mental or physical.

Gibson started his career at Smith College as a psychology teacher. While at Smith, Gibson encountered two influential figures in his life, one of which was the Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka. Although Gibson did not agree with Gestalt psychology, he nevertheless agreed with Koffka&#x27;s belief that the primary investigations of psychology should be problems related to perception. The other important figure Gibson met during his time at Smith College was his wife, Eleanor Jack, who became a prominent psychologist known for her investigations such as the &quot;visual cliff.&quot; The two were married on September 17, 1932, and later had two children, James Jerome Jr. in 1940 and Jean Grier in 1943.

In 1941, Gibson entered the U.S. Army, where he became the director of a unit for the Army Air Forces&#x27; Aviation Psychology Program during World War II. Of particular interest to him was the effect flying an aircraft had on visual perception. He used his findings to help develop visual aptitude tests for screening out pilot applicants. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946. After the war ended, he returned to Smith College for a short period during which he began writing his first book, &quot;The Perception of the Visual World&quot;, in which he discussed visual phenomena such as retinal texture gradient and retinal motion gradient. Before the book was published in 1950, Gibson moved to Cornell University where he continued to teach and conduct research for the rest of his life.

=== Honors and awards ===
After publication of his book in 1950, Gibson won the Warren Medal as a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1952. He also became a division president for the American Psychological Association (APA) and for the Eastern Psychological Association. Among many of Gibson&#x27;s other honors were receiving the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, becoming a Fulbright fellow at Oxford University, a fellow of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. Gibson was elected into the National Academy of Sciences in 1967. Gibson received honorary doctorates by Edinburgh and Uppsala Universities.

Gibson died in Ithaca, New York on December 11, 1979. He was 75 years old.

== Major contributions and works ==
=== Gibson&#x27;s approach to visual perception ===
The question driving Gibson&#x27;s research on perception was &quot;how do we see the world as we do?&quot;. This instigated his empirical research, the environment, and how the individual experiences said environment. There were two primary ways in which James J. Gibson reformed the way psychology views perception. The first is that the templates of our stimulation are affected by a moving organism. This was shown through his research on optic arrays. Secondly, he formulated the idea of three-dimensional space being conceptual. To Gibson, perception is a compilation of the person&#x27;s environment and how the person interacts with it.

James Gibson&#x27;s major contributions throughout his career were published in three of his major works: &quot;The Perception of the Visual World&quot; (1950), &quot;The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception&quot; (1979).

Much of Gibson&#x27;s work on perception derives from his time spent in the U.S. Army Air Force. Here, he delved into thoughts on how imperative perception is on daily functions. His work may be the first to show a distinct difference between types of perception. Form perception, on one hand, is a display of two static displays, whereas object perception, involves one of the displays to be in motion. Gibson laid down the base for empirical perception research throughout his lifetime. He did work on adaptation and inspection of curved lines, which became a precursor for perceptual research later. His basic work rejected the perspective that perception in and of itself is meaningless, he instead argued meaning is independent of the perceiver. He claimed that the environment decides perception, and that meaning is in what the environment &quot;affords&quot; the observer.

=== Major works ===
In his classic work &quot;The Perception of the Visual World&quot; (1950) he rejected the then fashionable theory of behaviorism for a view based on his own experimental work, which pioneered the idea that animals &#x27;sampled&#x27; information from the &#x27;ambient&#x27; outside world. He studied the concept of optical flow (later published as part of his theory of affordance). According to Gibson, one determines the optical flow (which can be described as the apparent flow of the movement of objects in the visual field relative to the observer) using the pattern of light on the retina. The term &#x27;affordance&#x27; refers to the opportunities for action provided by a particular object or environment. This concept has been extremely influential in the field of design and ergonomics: see for example the work of Donald Norman who interacted with Gibson and who adapted Gibson&#x27;s idea of affordances (with significant conceptual amendments) to industrial design.

In his later work (such as, for example, &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception&quot; (1979)), Gibson became more philosophical and criticised cognitivism in the same way he had attacked behaviorism before. Gibson argued strongly in favour of direct perception and direct realism (as pioneered by the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid), as opposed to cognitivist indirect realism. He termed his new approach ecological psychology. He also rejected the information processing view of cognition. Gibson is increasingly influential on many contemporary movements in psychology, particularly those considered to be post-cognitivist.
One of the most important statements in this book is that Gibson maintains that the optical information of an image is not an impression of form and color, but rather of invariants. A fixated form of an object only specifies certain invariants of the object, not its solid form. (p. 227)
Meaning that there is far more information available to our perceptual systems than we are consciously aware of, which may lead us to puzzle over &#x27;invariances&#x27; that our visual or other systems easily solve. Gibson did work on perception with his wife, Eleanor J Gibson. Together they proposed perceptual learning as a process of seeing the differences in the perceptual field around an individual. An early example of this is the classic research study done by Eleanor Gibson and R. D. Walk, the visual cliff experiment. In this experiment an infant that was new to crawling was found to be sensitive to depth of an edge.

=== Ecology and perception ===
Gibson believed that the environment and animals are not separable items. He stated that without the environment animals cannot survive and without animals there is no environment. The environment is what we perceive at any given moment. All animals are able to perceive. Humans perceive the environment directly. This is why we are unable to perceive things in the environment that are too small to see, such as an atom.

=== Affordances ===
Gibson coined the noun affordance. For Gibson the noun affordance pertains to the environment providing the opportunity for action. Affordances require a relationship in which the environment and the animal can work together. An example is that mankind has changed the environment to better suit our needs. When coming across Earth&#x27;s natural steep slopes, man designed stairs in order to afford walking. In addition, objects in the environment can also afford many different behaviors, such as lifting or grasping. Gibson argued that when we perceive an object we observe the object&#x27;s affordances and not its particular qualities. He believed that perceiving affordances of an object is easier than perceiving the many different qualities an object may have. Affordances can be related to different areas of the habitat as well. Some areas of the world allow for concealing while some allow for foraging.
== Legacy ==
James J. Gibson left a lasting impact on the way that psychologists and philosophers conceptualize perception and action. He rejected the behaviorists&#x27; assumptions that learning involves the formation of associations between stimuli and responses, adopting instead a holistic view related to that of the Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka with whom he had contact. He argued that the perceived environment is not composed by stitching together such elements as shapes and edges, but rather that the world is made up of meaningful features that are experienced continuously as wholes. He will perhaps be best remembered for his theory of affordances, which some theorists have suggested provides a fundamental way to understand the duality of mind and external reality.

Previous theories of sensory meaning have argued that perceptions are separate and private from one another. This stance placed all of the perceptive meaning on the individual, which meant there was no way to find common ground on individuals&#x27; shared experiences. Gibson contended that when stimulus information is being sought out, meaningful properties of that stimulus are also perceived relationally. For instance, a softball affords &quot;throwing&quot; if the observer notices that the ball fits well in a person&#x27;s hand, and that the weight allows it to be thrown. The training of aviators is a practical application of Gibson&#x27;s views, which such suggest that training should be as realistic and unconstrained as possible.

Gibson&#x27;s work indicates the interactivity of observers and the natural environment, and has been dubbed ecological psychology as a result. Gibson also argued that perceptual experimenters were misguided in their control over physical variables of stimuli, and the display of stimulus information should be manipulated instead. This stance breaks from traditional thought in that Gibson posited that fundamentally sound experiments could be conducted in the external world without having to construct artificial laboratory settings.

<text>The Poor Man and the Lady was the first novel written by Thomas Hardy. It was written in 1867 to 1868 and never published. After the manuscript had been rejected by at least five publishers, Hardy gave up his attempts to sell the novel in its original form; however, he incorporated some of its scenes and themes into later works, notably in the poem &quot;The Poor Man and the Lady&quot; and in the novella &quot;An Indiscretion in the Life of an Heiress&quot; (1878).

The manuscript no longer exists; Hardy destroyed the last surviving fragment during his last years, after abandoning the idea of reconstructing the rest of the novel from memory.

<text>Medway is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Bethel Township, Clark County, Ohio, United States. It is part of the Springfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. Near are the adjoining communities of Crystal Lakes and Park Layne. The population of its ZCTA for ZIP Code 45341, which includes Medway, was 4,110 at the 2000 census. Medway lies within the Tecumseh Local School District, whose high school mascot is the Arrows. Medway Elementary is the primary center of education for grades k-5.

== History ==
===European Discovery and the Founding of a Settlement (1671–1771)===
When European explorers, namely French fur traders, reached the Mad River in 1671, they found an abundance of beaver pelt among other prized furs. They followed the Honey Creek, through the current locations of the town of Medway where they established a small base camp (later moved to a Shawnee trading post near present-day Springfield, Ohio). On September 17, 1671, the Spangler party claimed all the lands comprising the drainage basin of the river, later renamed the Mad River, for Louis XIV as part of New France.

During the 1740s, the Wood&#x27;s River Land Company, which was represented by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne, attained a large tract of land within present-day southwest Ohio. Part of the tract became Clark County and Montgomery County and was sold to settlers entering the region. The Drapier and Ingles families were among those that built their homes somewhere between present locations of Medway and the subdivision of Park Layne. The settlement came to be called Drapier&#x27;s Meadow by 1748.

Seven years later, the Ohio Valley was involved in the brutality of the French and Indian War. This war resulted in British control over much of France&#x27;s North American holdings, including the Mad River fur trading posts located in present-day Medway. By the end of the war, the French had retreated and the Shawnee Amerindians gained control over the post. They subsequently moved to Springfield where the tribe already had a large settlement.

===George Rogers Clark and American Revolution (1772–1797)===
Medway played a notable role as part of the western campaign during the American Revolutionary War. General George Rogers Clark, led over 1,000 soldiers (among them Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton) across the Ohio River near present-day Cincinnati and engaged in numerous skirmishes with British regulars that had occupied French forts after the French and Indian War, and the Shawnee who were at the time allies of the Red Coats. The Shawnee gradually withdrew during the first few days before finally engaging American forces 7 miles west of Springfield in present-day Medway on August 8, 1782. After several hours of fighting, both sides suffered moderate casualties before scattering the small Shawnee rearguard. The victory against the Shawnee in the Medway/Mad River Valley area discouraged further Amerindian raids against Kentucky and other parts of the American frontier, and helped in part to secure the whole of the Ohio Territory for the Colonials. Rogers later remarked that the area that is now Medway was of significant strategic importance to the American cause as &quot;the Mad River was the artery to the Miami River, and the Miami, the Ohio River thereto.&quot; Medway was therefore of strategic importance and, as such, the federal government encouraged many veterans to use their war pensions to settle in the area; descendants of several of these Revolutionary war families reside in the village.

===Founding of Medway===
Medway was platted in 1816, and named for being the midway point between Springfield and Dayton. A post office called Medway has been in operation since 1850.

She was awarded the prestigious Fukuoka Prize in 2016 and the RIBA&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal in 2023.

==Early life==
Yasmeen Lari was born in 1941 in the town of Dera Ghazi Khan, and spent her early years in and around Lahore in a renowned clan of Iraqi Biradari. Her father Zafarul Ahsan, an ICS officer, was working on major development projects in Lahore and other cities, through which Lari was exposed to architecture. Her sister is Pakistani politician Nasreen Jalil. When she was 15 years old, she first left Pakistan to go to London with her family. Initially there for a vacation, she and her siblings ended up enrolling in school in London. Upon her rejection from architecture school, Yasmeen Lari studied two years of arts in London before being accepted into the School of Architecture, Oxford Brookes University (previously named Oxford Polytechnic).

==Career==
=== Architecture (1964–2000) ===
After graduating from the Oxford School of Architecture in 1964, Lari returned to Pakistan at age 23 with her husband, Suhail Zaheer Lari, and opened her architecture firm Lari Associates in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. She became the first female architect in Pakistan. Initially, she faced difficulties when workers at construction sites challenged her authority or knowledge because of her gender.

In 1969, Lari became an elected Member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).

Her later projects included housing such as the Angoori Bagh Housing (ABH) (1978), and commercial buildings such as the Taj Mahal Hotel, Karachi in 1981, the Finance and Trade Center in 1989, and the Pakistan State Oil House (PSO Company headquarters) in Karachi in 1991.

Lari retired in 2000 from architectural practice. However, she remains active with her historical preservation by serving as the advisor of the UNESCO project, as the executive director of Heritage Foundation Pakistan, and as the chairperson of the Karavan Initiatives.

=== Humanitarian efforts ===
Lari and her husband founded the &quot;Heritage Foundation of Pakistan&quot;, a humanitarian group in 1980. Since 2010, she has built some 50,000 Pakistani homes for humanitarian causes, such as for the victims of earthquakes and flooding. Lari implements traditional building techniques and local materials, such as in the 2013 rebuilding after floods in the Sindh Valley region of Pakistan and, again in that area in 2023, building low-cost, sustainable, bamboo and mud-plastered, one room homes or chauhras. In 2013, she helped villagers in Awaran District who were hit by the 2013 Balochistan earthquake.

In 2018, Lari designed a fuel-efficient and affordable chulah (stove) that improved on traditional stoves and did not emit toxic smoke into Pakistani homes. Her stove design won her a World Habitat award that same year.

Yasmeen Lari is one of the founders and current chairwoman of the Pakistani Chapter of the International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism (INTBAU), created in 2018.

== Design philosophy ==
On architectural practice in Southeast Asia, Lari has said, &quot;The two ends of the spectrum of the two worlds we live and work in are best captured in the words of two famous architects, Mies van der Rohe and Hassan Fathy. Mies van der Rohe, a master of putting the elements of a building together and the grand master of detail, has said: &quot;I am first interested in a good building. Then I place it in the best possible spot.&#x27; In contrast Hassan Fathy, who has spoken more forcefully than any other on the beatify of the vernacular and the importance of tradition, states: &#x27;You must start from the beginning, letting your new buildings grow from the daily lives of the people who will live in them, shaping the houses to the measure of people&#x27;s songs, weaving the pattern of a village as if on the village looms, mindful of the trees and the crafts that grow there, respectful of the skylines and humble before the seasons.&#x27;&quot;

She is best known for her work in the intersection of architecture and social justice.

In 2011, she received the Pakistani &quot;1st Wonder Women of the Year Award&quot;.

In 2016, she received the Fukuoka Prize for Arts &amp; Culture.

She has been awarded Jane Drew Prize 2020, raising the profile of women in architecture and design.

In 2021, the Politecnico di Milano awarded her the &quot;Laurea Magistrale ad Horonem&quot; in Architecture.

In 2022, she was appointed &quot;The Sir Arthur Marshall Professor of Sustainable Design&quot; in the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge.

In May 2023, she received the Honorary Doctorate in Design from Oxford Brooks University, where she graduated in 1964.

On 27 April 2023 RIBA announced her as the recipient of the 2023 Royal Gold Medal.

On hearing the news that she will receive the Royal Gold Medal later this year, Yasmeen said: &quot;I was so surprised to hear this news and of course totally delighted! I never imagined that as I focus on my country&#x27;s most marginalized people — venturing down uncharted vagabond pathways -- I could still be considered for the highest of honours in the architectural profession.

&quot;RIBA and the Award Committee have heralded a new direction for the profession, encouraging all architects to focus not only on the privileged but also humanity at large that suffers from disparities, conflicts and climate change. There are innumerable opportunities to implement principles of circular economy, de-growth, transition design, eco urbanism, and what we call Barefoot Social Architecture (BASA) to achieve climate resilience, sustainability and eco justice in the world.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Yasmeen Lari lives in Karachi, Pakistan. She was married to Suhail Zaheer Lari who passed away in 2020 due to COVID-19. She has three children.

<doc id="989039" wikidata="Q3410107" url="?curid=989039" title="Ecological psychology">
<text>Ecological psychology is the scientific study of the relationship between perception and action, grounded in a direct realist approach. This school of thought is heavily influenced by the writings of Roger Barker and James J. Gibson and stands in contrast to the mainstream explanations of perception offered by cognitive psychology. Ecological psychology is primarily concerned with the interconnectedness of perception, action and dynamical systems. A key principle in this field is the rejection of the traditional separation between perception and action, emphasizing instead that they are inseparable and interdependent. 

In this context, perceptions are shaped by an individual&#x27;s ability to engage with their emotional experiences in relation to the environment. This emotional engagement influences action, fostering collective processing, building social capital, and promoting pro-environmental behavior.

== Barker ==
Roger Barker&#x27;s work was based on his empirical work at the Midwest Field Station. He wrote later: &quot;The Midwest Psychological Field Station was established to facilitate the study of human behavior and its environment &quot;in situ&quot; by bringing to psychological science the kind of opportunity long available to biologists: easy access to phenomena of the science unaltered by the selection and preparation that occur in laboratories.&quot; The study of environmental units (behavior settings) grew out of this research. In his classic work &quot;Ecological Psychology&quot; (1968) he argued that human behaviour was radically situated: in other words, you couldn&#x27;t make predictions about human behaviour unless you know what situation or context or environment the human in question was in. For example, there are certain behaviours appropriate to being in church, attending a lecture, working in a factory etc., and the behaviour of people in these environments is more similar than the behaviour of an individual person in different environments. Barker later developed these theories in a number of books and articles.

== Gibson ==
James J. Gibson, too, stressed the importance of the environment, in particular, the (direct) perception of how the environment of an organism &quot;affords&quot; various actions to the organism. Thus, an appropriate analysis of the environment was crucial for an explanation of perceptually guided behaviour. He argued that animals and humans stand in a &#x27;systems&#x27; or &#x27;ecological&#x27; relation to the environment, such that to adequately explain some behaviour it was necessary to study the environment or niche in which the behaviour took place and, especially, the &quot;information&quot; that &#x27;epistemically connects&#x27; the organism to the environment.

It is Gibson&#x27;s emphasis that the &quot;foundation&quot; for perception is ambient, ecologically available information – as opposed to peripheral or internal sensations – that makes Gibson&#x27;s perspective unique in perceptual science in particular and cognitive science in general. The aphorism: &quot;Ask not what&#x27;s inside your head, but what your head&#x27;s inside of&quot; captures that idea. Gibson&#x27;s theory of perception is &quot;information-based&quot; rather than sensation-based and to that extent, an analysis of the environment (in terms of affordances), and the concomitant specificational information that the organism detects about such affordances, is central to the ecological approach to perception. Throughout the 1970s and up until his death in 1979, Gibson increased his focus on the environment through development of the theory of affordances - the real, &quot;perceivable&quot; opportunities for action in the environment, that are specified by &quot;ecological information&quot;.

Gibson rejected outright indirect perception, in favour of &quot;ecological realism&quot;, his new form of direct perception that involves the new concept of ecological affordances. He also rejected the emerging constructivist, information processing and cognitivist views that assume and emphasize internal representation and the processing of meaningless, physical sensations (&#x27;inputs&#x27;) in order to create meaningful, mental perceptions (&#x27;output&#x27;), all supported and implemented by a neurological basis (inside the head).

His approach to perception has often been criticised and dismissed when compared to widely publicised advances made in the fields of neuroscience and visual perception by the computational and cognitive approaches.

However, developments in cognition studies which consider the role of embodied cognition and action in psychology can be seen to support his basic position.

Given that Gibson&#x27;s tenet was that &quot;perception is based on information, not on sensations&quot;, his work and that of his contemporaries today can be seen as crucial for keeping prominent the primary question of &quot;what&quot; is perceived (i.e., affordances, via information) – before questions of mechanism and material implementation are considered. Together with a contemporary emphasis on dynamical systems theory and complexity theory as a necessary methodology for investigating the structure of ecological information, the Gibsonian approach has maintained its relevance and applicability to the larger field of cognitive science.

<doc id="989047" wikidata="Q7936606" url="?curid=989047" title="Visual markers of marital status">
<text>Visual markers of marital status, as well as social status, may include clothing, hairstyle, accessories, jewelry, tattoos, and other bodily adornments. Visual markers of marital status are particularly important because they indicate that a person should not be approached for flirtation, courtship, or sex. In some cultures, married people enjoy special privileges or are addressed differently by members of the community.

Marital status markers are usually gender-specific.

==Husband==
Male marital status markers are usually less elaborate than female marital status markers. In many cultures, they may not exist.

===Jewelry===
In many Western nations, some husbands wear a wedding ring on the third or fourth finger of the left hand. In parts of Europe, especially in German-speaking regions, as well as in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine, the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand. In the Netherlands, Catholics wear their wedding rings on the left hand, while most other people wear them on the right. Some spouses choose to wear their wedding ring on the left hand in Turkey.

In China, Western influence has resulted in some husbands donning wedding rings. 

In modern times, the material of wedding rings is not strictly prescribed; they may be forged of gold, rose gold, white gold, argentium silver, palladium, platinum, titanium, or tungsten carbide.

Manual laborers sometimes wear rings of inexpensive or more durable materials like tungsten while working or bear an ink tattoo to avoid personal injury or damaging a ring of precious metal. Additionally, the use of silicone wedding bands has become more common among men (and women) while in a gym or other environment with potential hazards (firefighter, etc.); these bands have enough flexibility to snap off if caught and are not typically electrically conductive.

===Beard===
Among the Amish, and Hutterite communities of Canada and the United States, only married men are permitted to grow and maintain a beard. Unmarried men were required to shave.

===Sacred thread===

In contemporary Hinduism, after the Upanayana ceremony, Brahmin men wear a sacred thread (Yagnopavitam) over their left shoulder and under right arm, one that usually has 3 strands and 1 knot, when they start their traditional education. When men get married, they wear one more sacred thread, 6 strands and 2 knots, the second thread signifies his marriage to his wife. In traditional attire, the sacred thread is usually visible, but in the modern era, it is hidden within the shirt.

==Wife==

===Jewelry===
* Engagement ring: In many Western cultures, a proposal of marriage is traditionally accompanied by the gift of a ring. The man proposes and offers the ring; if the woman accepts this proposal of marriage, she will wear the ring, showing she is no longer available for courtship. In British-American tradition, diamond rings are the most popular type of engagement ring. The engagement ring is usually worn on the left ring finger (sometimes this ring is switched from the right to the left hand as part of the wedding ceremony). 
* Wedding ring: Many Western wedding ceremonies include the exchange of a wedding ring or rings. A common custom is for the groom to place a ring on the bride&#x27;s finger and say, &quot;With this ring I thee wed.&quot; Sometimes both bride and groom present each other with rings and repeat either these or similar words. After the ceremony, the rings are worn throughout the marriage. In the event of divorce, the couple usually removes their rings; but some widows continue to wear their wedding ring, sometimes switching it to the right hand, while others do not. In Jewish tradition, the wedding ring must be a plain band, without gemstones. China has acquired the custom of wedding rings as late as the era of post-Cultural Revolution economic reforms, when rings were affordable and Western influence was allowed in. As an adopted habit, there are variations on how rings are used, if at all, and when. Some women wear the wedding ring on the left hand, men on the right (representing yin and yang). Some men wear the ring on the right hand. Many Chinese put the ring away to protect it, except for important holidays, such as anniversaries. In Chinese tradition, higher status for men was signified by having several young female partners or concubines. A ring denies that status. For this reason, many modern Chinese men do not wear a wedding ring. Diamonds and two-partner wedding rings are advertised in modern China. The Japanese, despite American occupation in the 1950s, only acquired a culture for wedding and engagement rings in the 1960s. In 1959, the importing of diamonds was allowed. In 1967 a U.S. advertising agency created a marketing campaign on behalf of the De Beers diamonds. The campaign equated rings with other symbols of Western culture. The campaign resulted in a sharp increase in demand: From 5% in 1967, to 27% in 1972, to 50% in 1978, to 60% in 1980.
*Toe rings: Toe rings in India are usually made of silver and worn in pairs (unlike in Western countries, where they are worn singly or in unmatched pairs) on the second toe of both feet. Traditionally they are quite ornate, though more contemporary designs are now being developed to cater to the modern bride. Toe rings may not be made of gold, as gold holds a &#x27;respected&#x27; status and may not be worn below the waist by Hindus.
* Mangalasutra: In Hindu wedding ceremonies, the groom gives the bride a gold pendant or necklace incorporating black beads or black string. This is called a &quot;mangalasutra&quot;. It not only proclaims a woman&#x27;s marriage, but it is believed by many to exercise a protective influence over the husband. This resembles the karwa-chauth celebration, in which a wife fasts and prays for her husband&#x27;s welfare.
* Bangles: Hindu wives also wear bangles of either white (&quot;sankha&quot;) and/or red colour (&quot;pala&quot;) on both hands, and do not remove them until they are single. Often made of glass, they are broken when the marriage ends. Bangles made of gold, silver, or other materials are also worn by middle class wives. 

===Headwear===
In Orthodox Judaism, married women cover their hair at all times outside of their home. The kind of hair covering may be determined by local custom or personal preference. Headscarves, snoods, hats, berets, or – sometimes – wigs are used. Turkmen wives wear a special hat similar to a circlet that is denominated a &quot;Alyndaňy&quot;.

===Hairstyle===
* Hairstyle indicating marital status
* Zuni hair styles

===Cosmetics===
* Sindoor, a red powder (vermilion), is put on Hindu wives&#x27; foreheads to indicate their marital status.

===Clothes===
* Tibetan wives wear aprons.

<doc id="989049" wikidata="Q2251594" url="?curid=989049" title="Under the Greenwood Tree">
<text>Under the Greenwood Tree: A Rural Painting of the Dutch School is the second published novel by English author Thomas Hardy, published anonymously in 1872. It was Hardy&#x27;s second published novel, and the first of what was to become his series of Wessex novels. Critics recognise it as an important precursor to his later tragic works, setting the scene for the Wessex that the author would return to again and again. Hardy himself called the story of the Mellstock Quire and its west-gallery musicians &quot;a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages, ways, and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of [the 1850s]&quot;.

== Plot ==

The novel follows the activities of a group of west gallery musicians, the Mellstock parish choir, one of whom, Dick Dewy, becomes romantically entangled with a comely new village schoolmistress, Fancy Day.

The novel opens with the fiddlers and singers of the choir — including Dick, his father Reuben Dewy, and grandfather William Dewy — making the rounds in Mellstock village on Christmas Eve. When the little band plays at the schoolhouse, young Dick falls for Fancy at first sight. Dick seeks to insinuate himself into her life and affections, but Fancy&#x27;s beauty has gained her other suitors including Shiner, a rich farmer, and Mr Maybold, the new vicar at the parish church.

Maybold informs the choir that he intends Fancy, an accomplished organist, to replace their traditional gallery singing and string accompaniment to Sunday services. Reuben Dewy and the rest of the band visit the vicarage to negotiate, but reluctantly give way to the vicar&#x27;s wishes.

Dick seems to win Fancy&#x27;s heart, and the two become secretly engaged. When he is informed, Fancy&#x27;s father is initially opposed, but changes his mind when as a consequence Fancy stops eating and her health deteriorates. Some months later, after Fancy&#x27;s first Sunday service as organist, Maybold unexpectedly proposes marriage and promises Fancy a life of relative affluence; racked by guilt and temptation, she accepts. The next day, however, at a chance meeting with Dick, Maybold learns that Fancy is in fact already spoken for. Maybold writes her a letter, admonishing her to be honest with Dick and to withdraw her commitment to him if she indeed meant what she said in accepting Maybold. Fancy withdraws her consent to marry Maybold, and asks him to keep her initial acceptance forever a secret. Maybold again urges her to be honest with Dick about the episode.

The final chapter is a joyful and humorous portrait of Reuben, William, and the rest of the Mellstock rustics as they celebrate Dick and Fancy&#x27;s wedding day. The novel concludes after the ceremony with Dick telling Fancy that their happiness must be due to there being such full confidence between them. He says that they will have no secrets from each other, &quot;no secrets at all&quot;. Fancy replies &quot;None from to-day&quot; and, changing the subject, thinks &quot;of a secret she would never tell&quot;.

== Principal characters ==

* Dick Dewy: a young member of the Mellstock Choir, in love with Fancy Day
* Fancy Day: the new teacher at the village school
* Mr Maybold: the new vicar of Mellstock
* Robert Penny: one of the choir, a boot and shoe-maker by profession
* Reuben Dewy: Dick&#x27;s father, a tranter (carrier), the de facto leader of, and spokesman for, the Mellstock Choir
* William Dewy: Dick&#x27;s grandfather
* Geoffrey Day: Fancy&#x27;s father, gamekeeper and steward at one of the Earl of Wessex&#x27;s outlying estates
* Frederic Shiner: a rich farmer in Mellstock, and Dick&#x27;s rival in the courtship of Fancy.

==Background==
Hardy began work on what would become the first of his Wessex novels&quot;, Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; in 1871, the genesis of the novel being a conflict between his grandfather&#x27;s &#x27;string choir&#x27; of viols and voices in Stinsford church, and a new vicar who was determined to replace the choir with an up-to-date organ. He modelled Mellstock on Stinsford, and the Dewys&#x27; house on his own family home in the hamlet of Upper Bockhampton (now Higher Bockhampton). Although the characters were not directly modelled on members of his family, he did make use of the fact that his sister Mary had trained as a schoolteacher. Writing forty years later, Hardy recalled &quot;This story of the Mellstock Quire and its old established west-gallery musicians ... is intended to be a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages, ways, and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of fifty or sixty years ago.&quot;

The book was originally to be called &quot;The Mellstock Quire&quot;, but during the summer of 1871 Hardy added significant additional material, de-emphasising the tribulations of the choir and focusing the plot on the love story between Dick and Fancy. With the new structure came a new title, &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot;, taken from a song in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; (Act II, Scene V), and a subtitle, &quot;A Rural Painting of the Dutch School&quot;.

Having received a discouraging reply from Macmillan, to whom he offered the manuscript in 1871, Hardy accepted an offer from the ultimate publisher, Tinsley, of £30 for the copyright. Later, when Hardy had become more established, he attempted to retrieve the copyright but declined to pay Tinsley&#x27;s quoted price of £300; the copyright was to remain with the publisher and his successors until after Hardy&#x27;s death.

== Publication ==
&quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; was published by Tinsley on 15 June 1872, with the author&#x27;s name not appearing on the first edition. The novel was published in the United States in June 1873 by Holt &amp; Williams, and was serialised there the following year. When the book was republished in the UK in 1912 by Macmillan, the full title became &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree, or, The Mellstock Quire: A Rural Painting of the Dutch School&quot;.

== Criticism and analysis ==
The book was well reviewed on its publication, receiving special praise for its freshness and originality.

Sometimes grouped with Hardy&#x27;s lesser novels, &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; is also recognised by critics as an important precursor to his major works. In his 1872 review of the novel for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, the critic Horace Moule, one of Hardy&#x27;s mentors and friends, called it a &quot;prose idyll&quot;, and that judgement has stuck.

While the novel closes on an ambiguous and even sceptical note, it is nevertheless distinguished among Hardy&#x27;s fiction—particularly his Wessex novels—for its relative happiness and amiability. For the critic Irving Howe, &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; served as a kind of necessary prequel and establishing myth for the world of Wessex that Hardy depicted in subsequent tragic works: the novel, he argued, &quot;is a fragile evocation of a self-contained country world that in Hardy&#x27;s later fiction will come to seem distant and unavailable, a social memory by which to judge the troubled present.&quot;

Hardy&#x27;s 2006 biographer Claire Tomalin praised Hardy for the beauty and precision of his descriptive writing, and noted that the book has charmed generations of readers. Indeed, she said, there are always readers who go to him primarily to immerse themselves in &quot;the Dorset woodlands, streams and rivers, fields and meadows, cottages and churches, soft skies and birdsong&quot;.

Tomalin considered the villagers to be drawn sympathetically, and with beautifully turned dialogue, but noted that the author rather distances the rustic characters, inviting the reader to smile with him at their simplicity. This was something that Hardy himself recognised, and in 1912 he wrote: &quot;In rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the inevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were material for another kind of study of this little group of church musicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly, even so farcically and flippantly at times. But circumstances would have rendered any aim at a deeper, more essential, more transcendent handling unadvisable at the date of writing.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and TV ===
The story was adapted for a 1929 film, and for a 2005 BBC TV film (made in Jersey) with Keeley Hawes as Fancy Day and James Murray as Dick Dewy. (A 1918 US film of the same title is unconnected).

=== Stage ===
There have been several stage adaptations, including:

* a production by Patrick Garland at Salisbury Playhouse which transferred to the West End Vaudeville Theatre in 1978
* a production by Helen Davis that toured to a variety of locations in 2009 including Thame, Andover and Street
* a 2016 production by Jack Shepherd for New Hardy Players in Dorchester
* a Hammerpuzzle production that played at Gloucester and Cheltenham in 2019/20
* an opera by composer Paul Carr with libretto by Euan Tait adapted from the novel. The work was commissioned by Dorset Opera for their 50th anniversary, and first performed in July 2024 at the 2024 Dorset Opera Festival, directed by the composer.

<text>Sabiha Sumar (born 29 September 1961) is a Pakistani filmmaker and producer. She is best known for her independent documentary films. Her first feature-length film was &quot;Khamosh Pani (Silent Waters)&quot;, released in 2003. She is known for exploring themes of gender, religion, patriarchy and fundamentalism in Pakistan.

She, along with Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Samar Minallah, are some of the Pakistani women independent documentary filmmakers to have screened their work outside of Pakistan.

== Early life ==
Sumar was born in Karachi in 1961. Her parents were originally from Bombay (now Mumbai) and moved to Karachi during partition. When Sumar was growing up, her parents hosted many social gatherings that included Sufi poetry, music and liquor. She attended Karachi Grammar School.

Sumar studied Persian Literature at the University of Karachi, followed by Filmmaking and Political Science at Sarah Lawrence College in New York from 1980–83. She completed her post-graduate degree from Cambridge University, England in International Relations.

== Career ==

Sabiha Sumar has earned acclaim for her independent films, which deal with political and social issues such as the effects of religious fundamentalism on society, and especially on women. Sumar&#x27;s main interest has been on addressing primarily Pakistani women&#x27;s place in the world and how different aspects of society have affected them over the past several decades. Sumar&#x27;s first documentary, &quot;Who Will Cast the First Stone,&quot; deals with the state of three women in prison in Pakistan under the Hudood Ordinances. It won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco Film Festival in 1998. The film led to the quashing of death-by-stoning sentence for Shahida Parveen, who was accused of adultery. In 1992 Sumar founded Vidhi Films. Her documentary films include &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Why&quot; (1999), &quot;For a Place Under the Heavens&quot; (2003), &quot;On the roofs of Delhi&quot; (2007), and &quot;Dinner with the President: A Nation&#x27;s Journey&quot; (2007). Her film, &quot;Suicide&quot; &quot;Warriors&quot;, is about women in the Tamil Liberation Army. For &quot;a Place Under the Heavens&quot; addressed issues of religion, history and phallocentrism and gender. &quot;For a Place Under the Heavens&quot; kicked off a critical debate on women wearing the hijab in the Muslim World. In 2013, her latest feature film &quot;Good Morning Karachi&quot; was released. Her films have circulated internationally through film festivals, American universities, women’s organizations and human rights organizations. Sumar’s films have not been widely screened in Pakistan due to its content. &quot;Don’t Ask Why&quot; aired on a German-French channel. Sumar produced Oscar-winning documentary film &quot;Saving Face&quot;.

Her first feature film is &quot;Khamosh Pani (Silent Waters).&quot; It first aired in 2003. &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; is a fictional film that looks at religion, gender, honour killings, assault, trauma and colonialism in the wake of partition. It depicts the trauma of partition through a woman’s point of view. Sumar links the violent aftermath of partition to the violence of Zia-ul-Haq’s Islamization in 1979. The latter is a theme she explores in her other work as well, namely &quot;For a Place Under the Heavens.&quot; Sumar continues in the tradition of Partition cinema, among the likes of Deepa Mehta, Kamal Hasan, and Chadraprakash Dwivdei. &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; is one of the first films to offer a perspective on partition cinema from a Muslim lens. &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; was initially supposed to be a documentary film. When Sumar was researching for the film, she did not want to make her subjects relive trauma. The film is a fictional narrative that looks at the necessity of silence in face of healing from trauma. Sumar received funding for &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; from a number of international sources, including France, Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden. Most of the film was shot in Pakistan. &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; won fourteen international awards. It won Best Screenplay at the third KaraFilm Festival in 2003. Sumar won the Golden Leopard for Best Film at the Locarno International Film Festival. She also won the Audience Award and Silver Montgolfiere at the Nantes Three Continents Festival. &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; is a First Run title endorsed by the Human Rights Watch. Sumar faced difficulty finding places to screen the film in Pakistan due to its controversial themes. Sumar organised forty-one free screenings of the film across Pakistan. The film sparked a controversy regarding the main character’s suicide after its screening at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles.

== Personal life ==
She has one daughter, Dhiya, who accompanied Sumar in &quot;For a Place Under the Heavens&quot;. Sumar established the Centre for Social Science Research in Karachi.

<text>Desperate Remedies is the first published novel by English author Thomas Hardy. It is considered a sensation novel because it contains themes of bigamy, murder, illegitimacy, blackmail, and impersonation. It was released anonymously by Tinsley Brothers in 1871.

==Plot summary==
In &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot; a young woman, Cytherea Graye, is forced by poverty to accept a post as lady&#x27;s maid to the eccentric Miss Aldclyffe, the woman whom her father had loved but had been unable to marry. 

Cytherea loves a young architect, Edward Springrove, but Miss Adclyffe&#x27;s machinations, the discovery that Edward is already engaged to a woman whom he does not love, and the urgent need to support a sick brother drive Cytherea to accept the hand of Aeneas Manston, Miss Aldclyffe’s illegitimate son, whose first wife is believed to have perished in a fire; however, their marriage is almost immediately nullified when it emerges that his first wife had left the inn before it caught fire. Manston&#x27;s wife, apparently, returns to live with him, but Cytherea, her brother, the local rector, and Edward come to suspect that the woman claiming to be Mrs. Manston is an impostor. 

It emerges that Manston killed his wife in an argument after she left the inn, and had brought in the impostor to prevent his being prosecuted for murder, as the argument had been heard (but not seen) by a poacher, who suspected Manston of murder and had planned to go to the police if his wife did not turn up alive. In the novel&#x27;s climax, Manston attempts to kidnap Cytherea and flee, but is stopped by Edward; he later commits suicide in his cell, and Cytherea and Edward marry.

== Publishing history==
After Hardy had trouble publishing his first novel, he was told to &quot;attempt a novel with a purely artistic purpose, giving it a more &quot;complicated&quot; plot than was attempted with his first, unpublished novel.&quot; The publication of &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot; was Hardy&#x27;s breakthrough, and the first of a long string of novels that propelled him to the forefront of Victorian letters.

== Criticism==
Some critics cite &quot;quasi-gothic&quot; elements in &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot;. It was positively reviewed in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; and &quot;Morning Post&quot;. However, the review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; excoriated Hardy and his work, calling the book &quot;a desperate remedy for an emaciated purse&quot; and that the unknown author had &quot;prostituted his powers to the purposes of idle prying into the way of wickedness.&quot; Hardy wrote of the review: &quot;alas...&quot;The Spectator&quot; brought down its heaviest leaded pastoral staff on the prematurely happy volumes...the bitterness of that moment was never forgotten, at that moment I wished I was dead.&quot;

<text>The Boone River is a tributary of the Des Moines River in north-central Iowa in the United States. It is long and drains an area of . Via the Des Moines River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.

== About ==
The Boone River rises near Britt in western Hancock County and flows generally southwardly through Wright, Hamilton and Webster counties, past Goldfield and Webster City. It flows into the Des Moines River north of Boone.

Tributaries of the Boone River also drain portions of Kossuth and Humboldt counties. Two headwaters tributaries are known as the East Branch Boone River and the Middle Branch Boone River.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has designated the lower of the Boone River from Webster City to its mouth as a &quot;Protected Water Area&quot;. This stretch of the river cuts through a wooded valley and allows canoeing and fishing for smallmouth bass, channel catfish, walleye, northern pike and flathead catfish.

<doc id="989066" wikidata="Q1277201" url="?curid=989066" title="Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)">
<text>Earl of Abergavenny was an East Indiaman launched in 1796 that was wrecked in Weymouth Bay, England in 1805. She was one of the largest East Indiamen ever built. John Wordsworth was her captain during her last two successful voyages to China. He was also her captain on her fifth voyage and lost his life when she wrecked. &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; was built in Northfleet, Kent to carry cargo for the British East India Company (EIC). In 1804 she was one of the vessels at the Battle of Pulo Aura, though she did not participate in the action. She sank, with great loss of life, within days of leaving Portsmouth on the outward leg of her fifth voyage.

==Precautions==
East Indiamen preferred to travel in convoys. Frequently, vessels of the British Royal Navy escorted these convoys, though generally not past India nor before on the return voyage. The Indiamen themselves were heavily armed so that they could dissuade pirates and even large privateers.

As with many East Indiamen during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; sailed under letters of marque. These authorised her to take prizes should the opportunity arise.

==Voyages==
===Voyage #1 (1797–1798)===
&quot;Earl of Abergavenny″&quot;s first letter of marque was issued on 26 January 1797. Under the command of Captain John Wordsworth, Snr., she left Portsmouth on 18 March and reached Bombay on 5 July. By 17 November she was at Malacca and she arrived at
Whampoa on 8 January 1798. On her return leg she crossed the &quot;Second Bar&quot; (the &#x27;Second Bar&#x27; pagoda was a landmark and anchorage point on the Pearl River in Guangdong, China ) 2 March and reached St Helena on 5 August. She arrived at the Downs on 18 October.

===Voyage #2 (1799–1800)===
&quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot;, under the command of Captain John Wordsworth, Snr., left Portsmouth on 13 June 1799, reached Penang on 28 October, and Whampoa on 16 January 1800.

While she was at Canton, Wordsworth became involved in the &quot;&quot;Providence&quot; Affair&quot; when British sailors brought a wounded Chinese aboard her for medical care. A sentry on the schooner &quot;Providence&quot;, tender to , had fired on some men in a sampan attempting to cut &quot;Providence&quot;″s cables, wounding one man. Eventually the Chinese authorities dropped the &quot;&quot;Providence&quot; Affair&quot;.

On her return trip &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; crossed the Second Bar on 28 March and reached St Helena on 15 July. She then entered the Downs on 23 September.

===Voyage #3 (1801–1802)===
&quot;Earl of Abergavenny″&quot;s second letter of marque was issued on 5 March 1801. She then left Portsmouth on 19 May 1801 under the command of Captain John Wordsworth, Jnr. nephew to her previous captain. She reached Santa Cruz on 31 July, Penang on 31 October, Malacca on 24 November, and Whampoa on 30 January 1802. On her return she crossed the Second Bar on 11 March and reached St Helena on 10 July. She arrived in the Downs on 5 September.

===Voyage #4 (1803–1804)===
&quot;Earl of Abergavenny″&quot;s third letter of marque was issued on 20 June 1803, after she had already left on her fourth voyage. When she left Britain, the Peace of Amiens was still in effect; war broke out on 18 May, almost two weeks after she left the Downs on 6 May 1803, again under the command of Captain John Wordsworth, Jnr.

She reached Whampoa on 8 September. For her return voyage she crossed the Second Bar on 13 November.

The battle of Pulo Aura was a minor naval engagement fought on 14 February 1804, in which a fleet of East Indiamen, including &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot;, intimidated, drove off, and chased a powerful French naval squadron, although the French squadron was much stronger than they. Commodore Nathaniel Dance&#x27;s aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance, in &quot;Warley&quot;, together with several of the other vessels, then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger. The British lost only one man killed. &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; did not actually take part in the exchange of fire.

&quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; reached Malacca five days later, on 19 February 1804 and Penang on 1 March. She arrived at St Helena on 9 June and the Downs on 8 August.

==Voyage #5 (1805–wreck)==

&quot;Earl of Abergavanney&quot; left on her fifth voyage, this one to Bengal and China, under the command of Captain John Wordsworth Jnr (brother of William Wordsworth). She sailed with four other Indiamen and two whalers from Portsmouth on 1 February 1805. The four Indiamen were , , , and . Captain William Stanley Clarke of &quot;Wexford&quot; was the senior EIC commander. Captain John Draper and , herself a former merchantman, provided the naval escort.

On 5 February &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; struck on the Shambles off the Isle of Portland and then sank in Weymouth Bay with the loss of 263 lives, including Wordsworth, out of 402 people on board. Her complement for this voyage consisted of 160 officers and crew. She also carried 159 troops, from both the British Army and East India Company. Forty passengers were listed as being at the Captain&#x27;s table, while 11 were listed as being at the Third Mate&#x27;s table. In addition, there were 32 Chinese passengers.

Her loss was due to the pilot&#x27;s incompetence. After she struck on the Shambles she was got off, but sank as Wordsworth attempted to sail her onto the beach. Wordsworth stayed at his post and went down with his ship. About 90 to 100 people survived the sinking.

The total value of &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot;″s cargo was estimated to be £200,000. It consisted of porcelain and some £70,000 in specie. The EIC put the value of the cargo it had lost at £79,710.

Subsequent salvage attempts recovered the specie, which was in the form of 62 chests of dollars. By October 1807 almost all the valuable property had been recovered, including 30 pipes of wine. In September 1812 the wreck was blown up under water to prevent her forming a dangerous shoal.
==Archaeology==
&quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot; lies in 16 m (50 ft) of water and less than from the beach at Weymouth. There are several rows of wooden posts sticking out of the sand. Visibility is rarely more than 5 m (16 ft). The temperature ranges from 6 to 22 °C depending on the season.

In 2005 the Weymouth LUNAR Society received the Nautical Archaeology Society&#x27;s Adopt-a-Wreck award for their underwater archaeology work in surveying, monitoring and interpreting this shipwreck.

The ship featured in the Channel 4 series &quot;Wreck Detectives&quot;.

In July 2022, an ingot of Cornish tin salvaged from the shipwreck was auctioned for £2,400.

In August 2024, the shipwreck was granted special protection by the Department for Culture Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England as a scheduled monument.

<doc id="989069" wikidata="Q1138460" url="?curid=989069" title="Battle of Annual">
<text>The Battle of Annual was fought on 22 July 1921 at Annual, in northeastern Morocco, between the Spanish Army and Rifian Berbers during the Rif War. The Spanish suffered a major military defeat, which is almost always referred to by the Spanish as the Disaster of Annual () which is widely considered to be the worst defeat suffered by the modern Spanish Army.

It resulted in major political crises, the fall of several governments, a military dictatorship led by Miguel Primo de Rivera, the abdication of King Alfonso XIII and a complete reassessment of the Spanish colonial policy toward the Rif as the entire Spanish colonial enterprise was at one point threatened.

== Background ==
In early 1921, Spanish forces commanded by General Manuel Fernández Silvestre started an offensive into northeastern Morocco from the coastal regions that they already held. The advance took place without extended lines of communication being adequately established or the complete subjugation of the areas occupied. In the course of the Spanish offensive, the Spanish had penetrated almost into the enemy lines, but during the hasty advances, neither defensible forts nor accessible water supply points had been put in place. The territory newly occupied by the Spanish was garrisoned only by small makeshift blockhouses (&quot;blocaos&quot;), each manned by a platoon of soldiers (typically 12–20). The outposts were widely spread, typically located in high places, distant from water sources and lacking good communications with the main positions. The ultimate goal of the campaign was to establish a permanent military presence on the shores of Al Hoceima bay, a strategic point between the western and the eastern Moroccan coast.

The Rifian irregular forces were commanded by Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi (usually known as Abd el Krim), a former civil servant and translator in the Spanish Office of Indigenous Affairs in Melilla and one of the leaders of the tribe of the Aith Ouriaghel.

== Annual ==

On 15 January 1921 the Spanish forces under Silvestre occupied the small village of Annual in the valley of Beni Ulicheck, and established their main forward base for completing the occupation of eastern Morocco. Silvestre was considered an impetuous and aggressive personality, who was known to be a favourite of King Alfonso XIII. During his year in military command of the Melilla headquarters, Silvestre had doubled the amount of territory held by the Spanish in the central Rif.

Annual was situated about to the south-west of Melilla. Surviving photographs show the Annual encampment itself to have been a sprawling tented encampment spread over several slopes in a starkly empty landscape.

On 1 June 1921, a Spanish outpost set up just hours before on , a position east of Annual, was attacked and captured by Rifian guerrillas. The Spanish lost 24 soldiers killed and 59 wounded.

On 5 June, Silvestre met General Dámaso Berenguer Fusté, Spanish High Commissioner in the protectorate, aboard the Spanish cruiser &quot;Princesa de Asturias&quot; off Sidi Idris. Berenguer rejected Silvestre&#x27;s request for reinforcements.

Two days later, Silvestre decided to establish a new forward position, this time south of Annual, at the heights of Igueriben. The post was besieged by the Rifians on 14 July. The shortage of fresh water and the use of artillery by the Rifians forced the Spanish army to evacuate the position on 21 July, under heavy fire. Only 33 soldiers survived from a garrison of 300.

== Battle ==
On the eve of battle the Spanish garrison occupying the advanced encampment of Annual numbered 5,000 men. These were mostly Peninsula conscripts from the &quot;Ceriñola, Africa, Alcantara&quot; and &quot;San Fernando Regiments&quot;. In addition there were four batteries of artillery and about two thousand indigenous troops (&quot;Regulares&quot;) under Spanish officers.

On 22 July, after five days of skirmishing, the Spanish force was attacked by 3,000 Rif fighters. With ammunition low and the support base at Igueriben already overrun, General Silvestre, who had arrived at Annual only the day before, decided upon a withdrawal along the line of the previous Spanish advance. Just before 5 a.m. a last radio message was sent, reporting Silvestre&#x27;s intention to evacuate Annual later the same morning. At about 10 a.m., the garrison began to march in column from the encampment in the direction of Melilla, but poor leadership and inadequate preparation meant that any hope of a disciplined withdrawal quickly degenerated into a disorganised rout. Hitherto reliable Moroccan &quot;regulares&quot;, native police and tribal allies deserted to the Rifian forces, depriving the Spanish column of flankers and rear guard. The Spanish conscripts, under heavy fire and exhausted by the intense heat, broke into a confused crowd and were shot down or stabbed by the tribesmen. Only one cavalry unit, the &quot;Cazadores de Alcántara&quot;, kept in formation and was able to conduct a fighting retreat (see painting above), though suffering heavy casualties.

The overstretched Spanish military build-up in the Eastern Spanish Protectorate in Morocco crumbled. After the battle, the Rifians advanced eastward and overran more than 130 Spanish blockhouses. The Spanish garrisons were destroyed without mounting a coordinated response to the attacks. By the end of August, Spain had lost all the territories that it had gained in the area since 1909. General Silvestre disappeared and his remains were never found. According to one report, Spanish sergeant Francisco Basallo Becerra from the Kandoussi garrison, an outpost east of Annual, identified the remains of Silvestre by his general&#x27;s sash. A Moorish courier from Kaddour &#x27;n Amar said that eight days after the battle, he saw the corpse of the general lying face down on the battlefield and still recognizable by his sash and epaulettes.

== Spanish retreat ==
At Afraou, on the coast, Spanish warships evacuated the garrison. At Zoco el Telata de Metalsa, in the south, Spanish troops and civilians retreated to the French Zone. Spanish survivors of the battle retreated some to the spread-out fortified base of Monte Arruit, which was built between 1912 and 1916 and located south of Melilla. There, a stand was attempted under the leadership of General Felipe Navarro. As the position was surrounded, and cut off from water and supplies, General Berenguer authorised its surrender on August 9. The Rifians did not respect the conditions of surrender and killed 3,000 Spanish soldiers. General Navarro was taken prisoner, along with 534 military personnel and 53 civilians; they were ransomed some years later.

Melilla was only some away, but the garrison there was in no position to help since the city was almost defenceless and lacked properly-trained troops. The exhausted and demoralised survivors of Annual who reached Melilla were in no condition to reinforce the existing garrison effectively. However, the Rifian forces had largely dispersed following the capture of Monte Arruit, leaving Abd-el-Krim with insufficient men to lay siege to Melilla. In addition, citizens of other European nations lived in Melilla, and he did not wish to risk international intervention. Abd-el-Krim later stated that to have been his greatest mistake.

Spain quickly assembled about 14,000 reinforcements from elite units of the Army of Africa, which had been operating south of Tetouan in the Western Zone. They mainly comprised units of the Spanish Legion who had been newly raised in 1920, and Moroccan &quot;regulares&quot;. Transferred to Melilla by sea, the reinforcements enabled the city to be held and Monte Arruit to be retaken by the end of November.
The Spaniards may have lost up to 22,000 soldiers at Annual and in the subsequent fighting. The German historian Werner Brockdorff states that only 1,200 of the 20,000 Spanish troops escaped alive, but that estimate of losses is contradicted by the Spanish official inquiry. Rifian casualties were reportedly only 800. The final official figures for the Spanish death toll, both at Annual and during the subsequent rout which took Rifian forces to the outskirts of Melilla, were reported to the Cortes Generales as 13,192 killed, including Moroccan colonial forces.

Materiel lost by the Spanish, in the summer of 1921 and especially in the Battle of Annual, included 11,000 rifles, 3,000 carbines, 1,000 muskets, 60 machine guns, 2,000 horses, 1,500 mules, 100 cannons, and a large quantity of ammunition. Abd el-Krim remarked later: &quot;In just one night, Spain supplied us with all the equipment which we needed to carry on a big war.&quot; Other sources give the booty seized by the Rifians as 20,000 Mauser rifles, 400 Hotchkiss machine guns, and 120 to 150 Schneider artillery pieces.

== Aftermath ==
The political crisis brought about by this disaster led Indalecio Prieto to say in the Congress of Deputies: &quot;We are at the most acute period of the decline of Spain. The campaign in Africa is a total, absolute failure of the Spanish Army, without extenuation.&quot; The Minister of War ordered the creation of an investigative commission, led by General Juan Picasso González, which developed the report known as &quot;Expediente Picasso&quot;. The report detailed numerous military mistakes, but the obstructive action of various ministers and judges made it not go so far as to lay political responsibility for the defeat. In all, the defeat is often thought of in Spain as the worst of the Spanish army in modern times.

The disaster damaged morale among the remainder of the Spanish forces in Morocco, with officers starting to distrust their local auxiliaries about whom rumors of armed uprisings started to circulate.
Among the Spanish people, there was despair and anger with the government over the defeat. Many Spaniards started to demand that Spain completely pull out of its remaining African colonies.

The reasons for the crushing defeat may lie with Silvestre&#x27;s tactical decisions and the fact that the bulk of the Spanish army was formed by poorly trained conscripts. Popular opinion widely placed the blame for the disaster upon King Alfonso XIII, who, according to several sources, had encouraged Silvestre&#x27;s irresponsible penetration to positions far from Melilla without having adequate defenses in his rear. Alfonso&#x27;s apparent indifference to Abd el-Krim&#x27;s demand for ransom for the prisoners led to a popular backlash against the monarchy. (Vacationing in southern France, he reportedly said &quot;Chicken meat is cheap&quot; when informed of the disaster; other sources render the quote as &quot;Chicken meat is expensive&quot;.)
The crisis was one of the many that over the course of the next decade undermined the Spanish monarchy and led to the rise of the Second Spanish Republic.

The last Spanish military commander to mount any significant resistance during the battle was the General Felipe Navarro who was forced to surrender and was captured along with 534 military personnel and 53 civilians, all of whom were held by Abd-el-Krim at his headquarters in Axdir; of these, 326 survived the 18 months of captivity before eventually being released following negotiations undertaken primarily by members of the Indigenous Affairs Delegation, most prominently Gustavo de Sostoa and Luis de la Corte Luján, with the final conditions settled between Abd el-Krim himself and Horacio Echevarrieta. The terms of release included the payment by Spain of 4 million pesetas, a huge amount for the time. Once the ransom was received, the captives were released on 27 January 1923.

Most of the area occupied by the Rifian tribes was taken back by an expedition led by General Damaso Berenguer in 1922.

On 2 July 2012, the cavalry regiment &quot;Cazadores de Alcántara&quot; was awarded the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand by the Council of Ministers for its rearguard action in Annual.

<doc id="989070" wikidata="Q2931240" url="?curid=989070" title="A Pair of Blue Eyes">
<text>A Pair of Blue Eyes is the third published novel by English author Thomas Hardy, first serialised between September 1872 and July 1873, in &quot;Tinsley&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and published in book form in 1873. It was Hardy&#x27;s third published novel, and the first not published anonymously. Hardy included it with his &quot;romances and fantasies&quot;.

==Plot==
The book describes the love triangle of a young, blue eyed 19-year-old woman, Elfride Swancourt, and her two suitors from very different backgrounds. Stephen Smith is a socially inferior but ambitious young man who adores her and with whom she shares a country background. Henry Knight is the respectable, established, though sexually immature and inexperienced older man who represents London society. Although the two are friends, Knight is not aware of Smith&#x27;s previous liaison with Elfride.

Elfride finds herself caught in a battle with her heart, her mind and the expectations of those around her – her parents and society. When Elfride&#x27;s father finds that his guest and candidate for his daughter&#x27;s hand, architect&#x27;s assistant Stephen Smith, is the son of a mason, he immediately orders him to leave. Knight, who is a relative of Elfride&#x27;s stepmother, is later on the point of seeking to marry Elfride, but ultimately rejects her when he learns she had been previously courted.

Elfride, out of desperation, marries a third man, Lord Luxellian. The conclusion finds both suitors travelling together to Elfride, both intent on claiming her hand, and neither knowing either that she already is married nor that they are accompanying her corpse and coffin as they travel.

The novel has various settings including gothic churches, coastal cliffs, hills, valleys, and beaches.

==Characters==
Elfride Swancourt, the blue eyed 19-year-old heroine, is both extremely attractive and emotionally naïve; a Victorian Miranda.

Stephen Smith, her first suitor is socially inferior, also has this childish innocence, and she loves him because he is &quot;so docile and gentle&quot; (chapter 7).

Henry Knight, the second suitor, is more socially superior and dominantly masculine but sexually inexperienced and immature, with the expectation of Elfride&#x27;s spiritual and physical virginity. Knight is also Stephen Smith&#x27;s mentor. 

==Background==
This was the third of Hardy&#x27;s novels to be published and the first to bear his name. It was first serialised in &quot;Tinsley&#x27;s Magazine&quot; between September 1872 and July 1873.

The novel is notable for the strong parallels to Hardy and his first wife Emma Gifford. In fact, of Hardy&#x27;s early novels, this is probably the most densely populated with autobiographical events.

==Reception==
A review in the &quot;Examiner&quot; of &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; retrospectively referred to it as &quot;not so exclusively pictoral [as &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot;]; it was study of a more tragic kind, with more complex characters and a more stirring plot... Both &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; and &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; are very remarkable novels, which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation, and pictoral and narrative power of the writer.&quot;

Late in his life, Hardy met composer Sir Edward Elgar and discussed the possibility of Elgar basing an opera on the novel. Hardy&#x27;s death put an end to the project.

BBC Radio 4 recorded the book as a serial, with Jeremy Irons as Harry Knight.

==Literary criticism==
&quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; normally is categorised as one of Hardy&#x27;s minor works, &quot;a book with a few good points but a failure as a whole&quot;. Like &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot;, it contains melodramatic scenes that appear disconnected from the characters and plot.

A focus of critical interest of the novel is the scene in which Henry Knight reviews the entire history of the world as he hangs over the edge of a cliff (reputedly the origin of the term &quot;cliffhanger&quot;), and eventually is rescued by a rope of Elfride&#x27;s underwear. Carl J. Weber sources the scene to a picnic Hardy and his wife had, in which he was sent to search for a lost earring, claiming this passage is the &quot;first indication in the novels of Hardy&#x27;s ability to sustain interest in a tense situation by sheer power of vivid description.&quot; On the other hand, Millgate claims the scene forms part of the &quot;irrelevant&quot; description suited to the &quot;rag-bag&quot; of a novel. For Jean Brooks, the scene is &quot;macabre&quot; and an illustration of &quot;cosmic indifference&quot;, also highlighting the comic in the rescue.

However, Gittings and Halperin claim it is more likely the idea for this scene comes from an essay by Leslie Stephen titled &quot;Five minutes in the Alps&quot;. The &quot;cliff without a name&quot;, as it is referred to, is probably based on Beeny Cliff.

<doc id="989071" wikidata="Q3565097" url="?curid=989071" title="Stock car (rail)">
<text>In railroad terminology, a stock car or cattle car is a type of rolling stock used for carrying livestock (not carcasses) to market. A traditional stock car resembles a boxcar with louvered instead of solid car sides (and sometimes ends) for the purpose of providing ventilation; stock cars can be single-level for large animals such as cattle or horses, or they can have two or three levels for smaller animals such as goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry. Specialized types of stock cars have been built to haul live fish and shellfish and circus animals such as camels and elephants. Until the 1880s, when the Mather Stock Car Company and others introduced &quot;more humane&quot; stock cars, death rates could be quite high as the animals were hauled over long distances. Improved technology and faster shipping times have greatly reduced deaths.


==Initial use and development==
Rail cars have been used to transport livestock since the 1830s. The first shipments in the United States were made via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in general purpose, open-topped cars with semi-open sides. Thereafter, and until 1860, the majority of shipments were made in conventional boxcars that had been fitted with open-structured iron-barred doors for ventilation. Some railroads constructed &quot;combination&quot; cars that could be utilized for carrying both live animals as well as conventional freight loads.

Getting food animals to market required herds to be driven hundreds of miles to railheads in the Midwest, where they were loaded into stock cars and transported eastward to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals were typically lost along the way. Upon arrival at the local processing plant, livestock were either slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt.

The suffering of animals in transit as a result of hunger, thirst, and injury, was considered by many to be inherent to the shipping process, as was the loss in weight during shipment. A certain percentage of animal deaths on the way to market was even considered normal (6% for cattle and 9% for sheep on average, according to a congressional inquiry), and carcasses of dead animals were often disposed of along the tracks to be devoured by scavengers, though some were sold to glue factories or unscrupulous butchers. Increased train speeds reduced overall transit times, though not enough to offset the deleterious conditions the animals were forced to endure.

Some of the early railroad companies attempted to alleviate the problems by adding passenger cars to the trains that hauled early stock cars. The New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company followed this practice as early as 1839, and the Erie Railroad advertised that livestock handlers could ride with their herds in special cabooses. These early passenger accommodations were the predecessors of the later &quot;drovers caboose&quot; designs that were used until the mid-20th century. Railroad operating rules for livestock and handlers that rode the trains were very limited, as the handlers were private contractors or employees of the shippers, not employed by the railroads. A 1948 rulebook for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, for example, lists only one rule regarding livestock:
However, even with livestock handlers and faster schedules, many stock cars were still listed on company rosters with open roofs and very little in the way of improved conditions for the livestock themselves. Most railroads resisted the call for as long as possible from shippers for improvements to cars specifically designed to carry livestock. The railroads generally preferred to use standard boxcars because that type of car proved much more versatile in the number of different types of loads it could carry.

When the railroads and cattle industry failed to act quickly enough to correct these perceived deficiencies, the government and even the general public went into action. Claims were made that the meat of neglected animals was unfit for human consumption. In 1869, Illinois passed the first laws to limit the animals&#x27; time on board and required them to be given 5 hours&#x27; rest for every 28 in transit. Some railroads stepped in with their own new designs at this time, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s class KA stock car, a design first published in 1869 which featured a removable second deck for transporting pigs or sheep. However, double-deck stock cars had been experimented with as early as the 1830s on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in England. Other states such as Ohio and Massachusetts soon followed with similar legislation, though effective federal laws were not enacted until the passing of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906.
The first patented stock car designs that actually saw use on American railroads were created by Zadok Street. Street&#x27;s designs ( and , both issued on August 30, 1870) were first used in 1870 on shipments between Chicago and New York City. They were designed for trips to take 90 hours between the two cities and included water troughs fed from tanks under the floor, and food troughs fed from hoppers in the roof. Street&#x27;s design proved impractical as each car could carry only 6 steers. Alonzo Mather, a Chicago clothing merchant who founded the Mather Stock Car Company, designed a new stock car in 1880 that was among the first practical designs to include amenities for feeding and watering the animals while en route. Mather was awarded a gold medal in 1883 by the American Humane Association for the humane treatment afforded to animals in his stock cars. Minneapolis&#x27; Henry C. Hicks patented a convertible boxcar/stock car in 1881, which was improved in 1890 with features that included a removable double deck. George D. Burton of Boston introduced his version of the humane stock car in 1882, which was placed into service the following year. The Burton Stock Car Company&#x27;s design provided sufficient space so as to allow the animals to lie down in transit on a bed of straw.

In 1880, American railroads rostered around 28,600 stock cars. With the innovations developed by Mather, Hicks and others, this number nearly doubled in 1890 to 57,300, and was nearly tripled in 1910 to 78,800. During this period, the cars&#x27; capacities also increased. In the 1870s few stock cars were built longer than , and could carry about of stock. Car lengths increased to an average of in the 1880s and stock cars of this period regularly carried of stock.
Certain costly inefficiencies were inherent in the process of transporting live animals by rail, particularly because some sixty percent of the animal&#x27;s mass is composed of inedible matter. Even after the humane advances cited above were put into common practice, many animals weakened by the long drive died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. The ultimate solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from regional packing plants to the East Coast markets in the form of a refrigerated boxcar.

==Refrigerated cars==
A number of attempts were made during the mid-19th century to ship agricultural products via rail car. In 1857, the first consignment of &quot;dressed&quot; beef was carried in ordinary boxcars retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Detroit&#x27;s William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. He sold the design in 1868 to George Hammond, a Chicago meatpacker, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston.

In 1878, meat packer Gustavus Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car, one that proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats and allowed Swift &amp; Company to ship their products all over the United States, and even internationally. The refrigerator car radically altered the meat business. Swift&#x27;s attempts to sell Chase&#x27;s design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed, as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in stock cars, animal pens, and feedlots if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance.

In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then—when the American railroads refused his business—he contracted with the Grand Trunk Railway (who derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul the cars into Michigan and then eastward through Canada. In 1880 the Peninsular Car Company (subsequently purchased by ACF) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line&#x27;s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston. Competing firms such as Armour and Company quickly followed suit.

The subject cars travelled on the Erie, Lackawanna, New York Central, and Pennsylvania railroads.

==Specialized applications==

===Horse cars===

For many decades, racehorse owners regarded the railway as the quickest, cheapest, safest, and most efficient medium of equine transport. The horse express car allowed the animals (in some instances) to leave home the morning of a race, theoretically reducing stress and fatigue. 

As early as 1833 in England, specially padded boxcars equipped with feeding and water apparatus were constructed specifically for transporting draft and sport horses. In the United States, however, horses generally traveled in conventional stock cars or ventilated boxcars. Early on, the need for improved methods for tethering horses in boxcars, while at the same time allowing a horse enough room to maintain its balance while in transit, was recognized.

Racehorses, and those kept as breeding stock, were highly valued animals that required special handling. In 1885 a livery and stable operator from Toledo, Ohio by the name of Harrison Arms formed the Arms Palace Horse Car Company to service this market niche. Arms&#x27; cars resembled the passenger cars of the day; they featured clerestory roofs and end platforms and came equipped with passenger car trucks (as they were intended for passenger train service). The units were segregated into two separate compartments, each containing eight individual stalls. By the late 1880s Arms had acquired two competing firms, Burton and Keystone. While the cars operated by George D. Burton closely resembled the Arms design, the Keystone Company&#x27;s cars were much more utilitarian in design as they were intended for transporting animals of lesser value and inclusion in standard freight train consists. The Keystone fleet eventually grew to more than 1,000 cars.

Many of the cars finished out their days in maintenance of way (MOW) service.

===Circus use===
Many circuses, especially those in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, featured animals in their performances. Since the primary method of transportation for circuses was by rail, stock cars were employed to carry the animals to the show locations.

The Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, which traveled America by rail until it closed in 2017, used special stock cars to haul its animals. When a Ringling Brothers train is made up, these cars are placed directly behind the train&#x27;s locomotives, to give the animals a smoother ride. The cars that Ringling Brothers used to haul elephants were custom-built with extra amenities for the animals, including fresh water and food supply storage, heaters, roof-mounted fans and water misting systems for climate control, treated, non-slip flooring for safety and easy cleaning, floor drains that operate whether the train is moving or not, backup generators for when the cars are uncoupled from the locomotives, and specially designed ramps for easy and safe loading and unloading. Some of the cars also have built-in accommodation for animal handlers so they can ride with and tend to the animals.

===Fish cars===
In the 1870s the railroads of America were called upon to transport a new commodity, live fish. The fish were transported from hatcheries in the Midwest to locations along the Pacific coast, to stock the rivers and lakes for sportfishing. The first such trip was made in 1874, when Dr. Livingston Stone of the U.S. Fisheries Commission (which later became the United States Fish and Wildlife Service) &quot;chaperoned&quot; a shipment of 35,000 shad fry to stock the Sacramento River in California. The fish were carried in open milk cans stowed in a conventional passenger car. Stone was required to change the water in the cans every two hours when fresh water was available. The majority of the fish made the trip successfully and the result was a new species of shad for western fishermen.

In 1881, the Commission contracted and built specialized &quot;fish cars&quot; to transport live fish coast-to-coast. The technologies involved in hauling live fish improved through the 1880s as new fish cars were built with icing capabilities to keep the water cool, and aerators to reduce the need to change the water so frequently. Some of the aerators were designed to take air from the train&#x27;s steam or air lines, but these systems were soon deprecated as they had the potential to reduce the train&#x27;s safe transit; the air lines on a train were used in later years to power the air brakes on individual railroad cars.

Fish cars were built to passenger train standards so they could travel at higher speeds than the typical freight trains of the day. Also, by putting fish cars into passenger trains, the cars were held at terminals far less than if they were hauled in freight trains. Fish car services, throughout their use, required that the fish keepers ride along with the cargo; a typical fish car crew consisted of five men, including a &quot;captain&quot; who would coordinate the transportation and delivery, several &quot;messengers&quot; who would serve as freight handlers and deliverymen, and a cook to feed the crew. The cargo&#x27;s need for speedy transportation and passenger amenities for the crew necessitated the cars&#x27; inclusion in passenger trains.

Fish car operations typically lasted only from April through November of each year, with the cars held for service over the winter months. The cars became a novelty among the public and were exhibited at the 1885 New Orleans Exhibition, the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. As fish cars became more widely used by hatcheries, they were also used to transport regional species to non-native locations. For example, a fish car would be used to transport lobster from Massachusetts to San Francisco, California, or to transport dungeness crab back from San Francisco to the Chesapeake Bay.

The first all-steel fish car was built in 1916. Fish car technology improved again in the early 1920s as the milk cans that had been used were replaced by newer tanks, known as &quot;Fearnow&quot; pails. The new tanks were about lighter than the milk cans and included integrated containers for ice and aeration fittings. One long car, built in 1929, included its own electrical generator and could carry 500,000 young fish up to long. Fish car use declined in the 1930s as fish transportation shifted to a speedier means of transport by air, and to trucks as vehicle technology advanced and road conditions improved. The US government operated only three fish cars in 1940; the last of the fleet was taken out of service in 1947.

In 1960, Wisconsin Fish Commission &quot;Badger Car#2&quot; was sold to the Mid-Continent Railway Historical Society, where it is in the process of being restored as a part of the Society&#x27;s collection of historic rolling stock.

===Poultry cars===
From about 1890 to 1960, shipping live chickens and other birds by rail in special &quot;henhouses on wheels&quot; was commonplace. The cars featured wire mesh sides (which were covered with cloth in the winter to protect the occupants) and a multi-level series of individual coops, each one fitted with feed and water troughs. An attendant traveled on board in a central compartment to feed and water the animals. The cars were also equipped with a coal stove that provided heat for the center of the car.

The concept is thought to have been the brainchild of William P. Jenkins, a freight agent for the Erie Railroad. Jenkins collaborated with a Muncie, Indiana poultry dealer by the name of James L. Streeter on the design of a specialized car designed solely for transporting live fowl. The Live Poultry Transportation Company was formed about the same time that the first poultry car patent was issued (, issued August 26, 1884). By 1897, the company had 200 units in operation.

The Continental Live Poultry Car Company, a rival concern, was founded in 1890. Continental thought to dominate the market by offering larger cars, capable of transporting as many as 7,000 chickens in 120 coops, but the oversized cars failed to gain wide acceptance, and the firm closed its doors after just a few years in business.

==Modern conversions==

In the 1960s, the Ortner Freight Car Company of Cincinnati, Ohio developed a triple-deck hog carrier for the Northern Pacific Railway based on the design of long &quot;hi-cube&quot; boxcar called the &quot;Big Pig Palace.&quot; They later brought out a double-deck version called the &quot;Steer Palace&quot; that hauled livestock between Chicago and later Kansas City to slaughterhouses in Philadelphia and northern New Jersey until the early to mid-1980s on Penn Central and Conrail intermodal trains.

The Union Pacific Railroad, in an effort to earn more business hauling hogs from Nebraska to Los Angeles for Farmer John Meats, converted a large number of auto parts boxcars into stock cars. Originally built by Gunderson Rail Cars in Portland, Oregon for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, the conversions were done by removing the boxcars&#x27; side panels and replacing them with panels that included vents that could be opened or closed. The tri-level cars featured built-in watering troughs.

Strings of 5-10 of these &quot;HOGX&quot; cars were, until the mid 1990s, hauled twice weekly at the front of double-stack intermodal freight trains. However, this service was terminated when Farmer John Meats shifted to hogs produced locally in California. The units have since been scrapped.

<doc id="989077" wikidata="Q2661231" url="?curid=989077" title="The Hand of Ethelberta">
<text>The Hand of Ethelberta: A Comedy in Chapters is the fifth published novel by English author Thomas Hardy, published in 1876. It was written, in serial form, for &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;, which was edited by Leslie Stephen, a friend and mentor of Hardy. Unlike the majority of Hardy&#x27;s fiction, the novel is a comedy, with both humour and a happy ending for the major characters and no suicides or tragic deaths. The late nineteenth century novelist George Gissing, who knew Hardy, considered it &quot;surely old Hardy&#x27;s poorest book&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Ethelberta was raised in humble circumstances, but through her work as a governess married well at the age of eighteen. Her husband died two weeks after the wedding and, now twenty-one, Ethelberta lives with her mother-in-law, Lady Petherwin. In the three years that have elapsed since the deaths of both her husband and father-in-law, Ethelberta has been treated to foreign travel and further privilege by her benefactress, but restricted from seeing her poor family.

The events of the story concern Ethelberta&#x27;s career as a poet and storyteller as she struggles to support her family and conceal that her father is a butler. Beautiful, clever, and rational, she easily attracts four very persistent suitors, Mr. Christopher Julian, a struggling musician, Mr. Neigh and Mr. Ladywell, both gentlemen and friends, and Lord Mountclere, a 65-year old aristocrat with a dubious past. However, she is reluctant to give her much-coveted hand. She finally elects for Lord Mountclere, after he discovers the secret of her low birth and family, and she comes to dominate him, running his estate and saving him from bankruptcy. Her unrequited suitor Christopher Julian realises he would never have been happy with her had she married him, and settles for her younger sister Picotee who had been in love with him for years.

<text>Isaac Guillory (February 27, 1947 – December 31, 2000) was an American folk guitarist.

==Career==
Guillory&#x27;s first band was The Continentals in Gainesville, Florida in 1960 at age 13. This band, which later changed its name to Maundy Quintet, included Don Felder and Stephen Stills, and later Bernie Leadon, who was an original member of the Eagles.

In 1961, he moved with his family 45 miles east to Palatka, Florida for his dad&#x27;s work. Guillory&#x27;s first performances began in 1965 while attending St. Johns River State College in Palatka where he became a member of The Illusions, eventually becoming lead guitarist.

Towards the end of 1965, Guillory moved to Chicago where he studied at the Chicago School of Music and Roosevelt University. He recorded two albums there in the late 1960s with The Cryan&#x27; Shames, having joined them in 1967 as bass player.

He then attended Wright Junior College for three years where he played with The Revelles. The group played with Chicago DJ, Art Roberts, of WLS. He then played with The Cryan&#x27; Shames.

During 1970 to 1976, Guillory performed at the Shakespeare&#x27;s Head Folk Club in Carnaby Street, London, England.

After active resistance to the Vietnam War, Guillory left the US in November 1970, acquired a Martin D-35 and lived throughout Europe. He worked as an acoustic solo performer and settled in the United Kingdom. Guillory developed &#x27;hybrid picking&#x27;, where he would sustain a bass line with a plectrum held between his thumb and first finger, whilst picking chord and melody lines with his second and third fingers.

Having studied classical guitar in his younger years, Guillory incorporated quasi-classical techniques into his playing and on occasions would even throw in some pure classical guitar pieces, merging them into various songs as a medley.

He was widely known for insisting on carrying his own PA sound system with him from gig to gig. This allowed him to reproduce the exact sound he wanted night after night regardless of the venue. This was quite rare at the time with solo singer/guitarists on the folk circuit and certainly helped him to communicate his renowned performing skills to his audiences without having to fear the usual technical blips that can occur using a venue&#x27;s house PA.

He always concentrated on live solo performances (which put him up-close with more intimate small audiences) and sharing his understanding of music; touring, creating his own online guitar school. After an initial recording deal with Atlantic Records published five more CDs on his own independent label, Personal Records. As a performer he was dedicated to sharing his gift with both audience and fellow musicians, and as a teacher he never hesitated to share in a manner that others could understand.

He performed frequently as a guest artist for recordings and films with, among many others, Al Stewart, Donovan, Mick Jagger, Elkie Brooks, Michael Marra, Peter Sarstedt, Buggles, Barbara Dickson, and Nick Heyward. Guillory released &quot;Isaac Guillory&quot;, a self-titled album in 1974. For a while he delved into jazz fusion and recorded with Pacific Eardrum. Guillory lectured at the Guildhall School of Music in London. His music can be heard on &#x27;A&#x27; Net Station, a web radio station that he helped found, where his website continues to be available.

He also wrote &quot;The Guitar Hand Book&quot; with friend, Ralph Denyer, which became the foundation for the BBC series &quot;Rockschool&quot;.

In his later years, he performed on the folk club circuit in Great Britain. His virtuoso guitar playing made him popular with audiences and ensured a steady stream of work as a performer and teacher. His final album, &quot;The Days of &#x27;49&quot;, recorded on tour during late 1999 and released in early 2000, included a number of solo compositions as well as arrangements of some folk standards. His tribute to the British guitarist John Renbourn, &quot;Dear John&quot;, is one of the highlights of an outstanding album.

==Personal life==
Guillory was born at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. His father, Easton Joseph Guillory (1918-1965), was an American sailor (a U.S. Navy chief damage controlman) who later studied industrial and mechanical engineering at the University of Florida and worked as an industrial engineer for the Hudson Pulp and Paper Corporation at Palatka, Florida; his mother, Victoria (died 2011), daughter of Vitali Ojalvo, was a professional musician and later a Spanish/ English federal court interpreter. He had a sister, Claire. His maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Turkey, who met and married by arrangement only 10 days before they sailed for Cuba. His family was Jewish.

He attended the Conservatory of Music, Havana, where he studied classical piano at the age of six. Guillory&#x27;s mother, a professional musician, taught him to play guitar. When he was 11, Guillory moved to Tallahassee, Florida. At age 14, he moved again to Gainesville, then finally settled in Palatka, Florida for his father&#x27;s work.

By age 14, after enrolling in University of Florida&#x27;s swimming program, he became an assistant swimming instructor. He was a student at St. Johns River State College, at the time named St. Johns River Junior College, in Palatka. There, he studied the cello and saxophone.

He married twice, first to the English model Tina Thompson (divorced 1990), mother of Jace and British actress and model Sienna Guillory, then in 1993, to Victoria McMillan, mother of Easton and Ellerose.

Guillory died on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000. His death was attributed to complications from cancer that had gone undetected for some time.

<doc id="989087" wikidata="Q17149804" url="?curid=989087" title="Troop sleeper">
<text>In United States railroad terminology, a troop sleeper was a railroad passenger car which had been constructed to serve as something of a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.

==History==

===Background and development===
Between December 1941 and June 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed services personnel. In spring 1943, about half of the Pullman Company&#x27;s 7,000 sleeper cars were being used to transport troops. As there were not enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry to build 440 troop kitchen cars.

This new rolling stock was either converted from existing boxcars or built from scratch based on Association of American Railroads standard single-sheathed steel boxcar designs, and were constructed entirely out of steel with heavily reinforced ends. In some instances baggage cars were converted into temporary kitchen cars before ACF could complete its order. The cars were painted the standard Pullman Green and affixed with gold lettering. Along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s &quot;Surf Line,&quot; trains consisting of 10-12 former Southern Pacific interurban trailer cars, owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission but bearing Santa Fe markings, were fitted with conventional knuckle couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into service to handle the additional passenger loads.

Equipped with special Allied Full Cushion high-speed swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers were designed to be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors similar to those found on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side at the center of the cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.

Troop sleepers, generally intended for use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were laid out in a cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted at each end of the car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.

===Troop kitchens===
Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, also joined the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals in their seats or bunks). As the cooking was performed by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped with a pair of cold water tanks and a hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed in the middle of the train so that food could be served from both ends.

Troop hospital cars, also based on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths which could be used for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice air-conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.

===Afterlife and preservation===
Troop cars saw service through 1947, after which many were declared surplus and sold by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and were subsequently converted into baggage cars, express service boxcars, refrigerator cars, and cabooses, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use as bunk cars by maintenance of way crews. Several Kitchen Cars remained in Department of Defense service, being converted into Guard Cars to accompany sensitive military rail movements, such as military unit equipment deployments, and the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s mobile B-52 and KC-135 cockpit simulators.

Subsequent conflicts have not created the need for such an arrangement, partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long-distance transportation of troops. Today, preserved troop sleepers and kitchen cars can be seen at several railroad museums and tourist railroads across the United States.

Troop sleeper #7437 is on display at the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD. It was purchased as surplus by the Western Maryland Railroad and used on work trains as crew quarters. The museum has restored it to its original outside appearance. The inside has half the beds put back and the other half has displays about B&amp;O&#x27;s services during the war.

<text>Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU, The Valley or Valley) is a public historically black university in Mississippi Valley State, Mississippi, adjacent to Itta Bena, Mississippi. MVSU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==
The institution, which opened in 1950, was created by the Mississippi Legislature as Mississippi Vocational College. The legislation to form the institution was signed into law by Governor Thomas L. Bailey on April 5, 1946. On February 10, 1950, Governor Fielding L. Wright served as the main speaker at the opening ceremony.

The legislature anticipated that legal segregation of public education was in danger because there were increasing challenges to it through legal suits (in 1954 it was declared unconstitutional in the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;). It created this institution in the hopes that it would attract African-American applicants who might otherwise apply to Mississippi&#x27;s premier whites-only institutions: the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi.

State leaders hoped that founding separate institutions of higher learning for Mississippi&#x27;s black population would reduce the pressure to integrate the state&#x27;s premier universities. To attract the support of those who opposed any government action to provide higher education to black people, those proposing creation of M.V.C. used the term &quot;vocational&quot; to imply that the institution&#x27;s main purpose would be to train black people to take on blue-collar jobs.

The site selection committee appointed by the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning had originally selected as a site the former Greenwood Army Air Base, which had many facilities ready for use and thus would have been a very cost-effective choice. The &quot;Greenwood Commonwealth&quot; celebrated the choice. However, residents of Carroll County, Mississippi objected to having the institution located near their properties.

After further study, the committee selected a site in Itta Bena. Whites of that town also objected to having a black institution nearby, so the final site chosen was away from the downtown area, and on land that was not good for cultivation.

In 1964, Mississippi Vocational College was renamed Mississippi Valley State College. In February 1969, a nonviolent student boycott, which included eight hundred students, male and female, was organized to protest President James Herbert White&#x27;s administration. The students demanded required courses in black history, more library purchases of works by black writers, remedial courses in English and Math, scheduling of prominent black speakers, and fewer curfew restrictions.

In the early 1970s, civil rights leaders continued to protest the inequalities in higher education opportunities offered to whites and blacks in Mississippi. In an effort to defuse some of the criticism, Gov. Bill Waller proposed changing the names of three black institutions from &quot;colleges&quot; to &quot;universities&quot;. Thus, in 1974, the institution was renamed again, as Mississippi Valley State University.

Following President White, Dr. Ernest A. Boykins, Jr. took office in July 1971. Dr. Joe L. Boyer became MVSU&#x27;s third president in January 1982 and was followed by Dr. William W. Sutton in July 1988. Dr. Lester C. Newman became the fifth president of MVSU on July 1, 1998. Dr. Donna H. Oliver became MVSU&#x27;s sixth president and first female president on January 1, 2009. On November 6, 2013, Dr. William Bynum took office as MVSU&#x27;s seventh president.

In May 2017, Bynum departed MVSU to become president of Jackson State University. Dr. Jerryl Briggs, who served as executive vice president and chief operating officer in Bynum&#x27;s administration, was named interim president of the university shortly afterwards. On October 19, 2017, Briggs was officially named as the university&#x27;s eighth president.

In a 1997 article in &quot;Innovative Higher Education&quot;, the journalist Dale Thorn describes MVSU&#x27;s successful attempt to avoid a merger with another institution and to remain a separate entity.

In 1998, the university renamed many of the buildings on campus, except for those named for white supremacist politicians Walter Sillers, Jr., Fielding Wright, and J. H. White.

==Campus==

The campus is on a tract of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 82.

It is in Mississippi Valley State census-designated place, in unincorporated Leflore County, in the Mississippi Delta region. It is northwest of Itta Bena. The university is about from Greenwood, about from Greenville, about north of Jackson, and about south of Memphis, Tennessee.

MVSU includes faculty and staff apartments and other residential apartments. Dependent children living in these units are within the Greenwood-Leflore School District. These apartments were formerly served by the Leflore County School District. Effective July 1, 2019 this district consolidated into the Greenwood-Leflore School District.

==Academics==
Mississippi Valley State University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through the following entities:
*College of Art &amp; Sciences
*College of Professional Studies
*College of Education
*Graduate School

MVSU offers an honors program for high-achieving undergraduate students on campus.

MVSU was accredited in 1968 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees.

==Student activities==
Extracurricular programs include theater, special interest groups, orchestra, fraternities, sororities, and band. Students may work on the &quot;Delvian&quot; (yearbook) or the &quot;Delta Devil Gazette&quot; (student-run newspaper). Leadership opportunities are found in the Student Government Association (SGA) or other organizations such as English Club, Future Teachers of America, and Trades and Industries Club.

===Mean Green Marching Machine===
Mississippi Valley State University&#x27;s marching band is known as the &quot;Mean Green Marching Machine&quot; (also goes by the moniker of &quot;The Mack Of The SWAC&quot;) and the &quot;Satin Dolls&quot; are the featured dance squad. The band holds the distinction of being the first African-American band to participate in the Tournament of Roses parade, which it achieved in 1965.

The Mean Green Marching Machine was invited to perform during Donald Trump&#x27;s second inauguration and participated in the parade January 20, 2025, at Capital One Arena. The parade was moved indoors due to inclement weather.

==Athletics==
MVSU&#x27;s colors are forest green, red and white. Their nickname is the Delta Devils for men&#x27;s teams and Devilettes for women&#x27;s teams. MVSU sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (I-AA for football) in the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Famous alumni include NFL wide receiver Jerry Rice of the 1984 football team.

In 2016, MVSU completed $17.5 million worth of renovations to the Harrison HPER Complex. The 87,042 square foot multi-purpose arena is home to MVSU men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, commencement ceremonies, and other special events. The facility includes features such as fitness centers, an indoor walking track, and three technology HPER classrooms.

Willie &quot;Satellite&quot; Totten, who was an assistant football coach at MVSU, was the college quarterback at the school when Jerry Rice played. The football stadium is named for them. Totten now coaches at Southern University in Louisiana.

==WVSD 91.7 FM==
MVSU&#x27;s on-campus public radio station is WVSD 91.7 FM. The station offers a variety of programming involving MVSU, current events, and music.

<text>Harvey Sacks (July 19, 1935 – November 14, 1975) was an American sociologist influenced by the ethnomethodology tradition. He pioneered extremely detailed studies of the way people use language in everyday life. Despite his early death in a car crash and the fact that he did not publish widely, he founded the discipline of conversation analysis. His work has had significant influence on fields such as linguistics, discourse analysis, and discursive psychology.

==Life and academic career==
Sacks received his doctoral degree in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley (1966), an LL.B. at Yale Law School (1959), and a B.A. at Columbia College (1955). He lectured at the University of California, Los Angeles and Irvine from 1964 to 1975.

In 1975 Sacks died in a car accident. He was survived by his wife, two siblings, and his parents.

==Work==

Sacks became interested in the structure of conversation while working at a suicide counseling hotline in Los Angeles in the 1960s. The calls to the hotline were recorded, and Sacks was able to gain access to the tapes and study them. In the 1960s, prominent linguists like Noam Chomsky believed that conversation was too disorganized to be worthy of any kind of in-depth structural analysis. Sacks strongly disagreed, since he saw structure in every conversation, and developed conversation analysis as a result.

Sacks&#x27;s recorded lectures were transcribed (by Gail Jefferson who also edited them posthumously) but the tapes were not saved. The duplicated copies of the transcribed lectures were made freely available by Sacks and achieved international circulation and recognition during his lifetime and subsequently .

He treated such topics as: the organization of person-reference; topic organization and stories in conversation; speaker selection preferences; pre-sequences; the organization of turn-taking; conversational openings and closings; and puns, jokes, stories and repairs in conversation among many others.

==Legacy==

Emanuel Schegloff, one of Sacks&#x27;s close collaborators, colleagues and co-authors, became his literary executor. The subsequent handling of the literary estate (&quot;nachlass&quot;, to use the academic term) has attracted some controversy.

Sacks&#x27;s major work, &quot;Lectures on Conversation,&quot; is composed of edited revisions of transcribed lectures held from Spring 1964 through to 1972, and comprises about 1200 pages in a two-volume work published by Basil Blackwel in 1992. This publication project was instigated largely by David Sudnow and Gail Jefferson, colleagues and students of Sacks at Berkeley, UCLA and Irvine, and includes an introduction by Emanuel Schegloff. In her acknowledgements in these volumes, Jefferson mentioned the help of Sudnow in dealing with Sacks&#x27;s literary estate. The Harvey Sacks Memorial Association, registered as a not-for-profit Association, was formed by Sudnow.

These &quot;Lectures&quot; have been important for Sacks&#x27;s later influence and for the field of Conversation Analysis.

Sudnow was a follower of Alfred Schutz in phenomenology, and Harold Garfinkel in ethnomethodology. Sudnow regards the work of Sacks as outside the ethnomethodological mainstream. By contrast Garfinkel lists Sacks as one of &#x27;Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Authors&#x27;

<text>The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) is a TUC and ICTU -affiliated trade union representing teachers, including headteachers, throughout the United Kingdom.

== The early years 1919–1976; breakaway and the formation of a new union ==
The origins of the NASUWT can be traced back to the formation of the National Association of Men Teachers (NAMT) in 1919, which formed as a group within the National Union of Teachers (NUT) to promote the interests of male teachers. The formation of the NAMT was in response to an NUT referendum the same year, approving the principle of equal pay for women.

The NAMT continued its campaign to further the interests of male teachers, changing its name in 1920 to the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS). In 1922 the NAS broke away from the NUT and established its own organisation. The secession came about indirectly following a decision at the NAS Conference that year, to prohibit NAS members from continuing to also be members of the NUT after the 31 December 1922.

The NAS aimed to recruit every schoolmaster into the NAS, to safeguard and promote the interests of male teachers, to ensure recognition of the social and economic responsibilities of male teachers, and to ensure the representation of schoolmasters on matters concerned with education, with both the local education authorities (LEAs) and government. The NAS also maintained that all boys over the age of seven should be taught mainly by men and that schoolmasters should not serve under women heads.

As the secondary education sector expanded, the NAS built its organisation among male secondary teachers, it adopted the methods of collective bargaining and militant industrial action in pursuing a narrow range of pay and conditions issues related to the interests of full-time male &#x27;career teachers&#x27;.

By the 1960s, the union was still opposed to admitting women as members, but it was concerned that the unions open to women teachers were all hostile to its objectives. As a result, it encouraged the formation of the Union of Women Teachers (UWT).

In 1976 the NAS merged with the Union of Women Teachers (UWT) and the Scottish Schoolmasters&#x27; Association (SSA). The merger was largely a consequence of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which made it unlawful to exclude from membership on grounds of gender. It then became the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT). The &#x27;slash&#x27; separating the two sections of the union was later dropped and the name usually appeared subtitled &#x27;The Career Teachers Union&#x27; – a reference to the lifelong commitment of the &#x27;career&#x27; classroom teacher.

Although from many years the union had officially registered its name with the Certification Office for Trade Unions and Employers Associations as the NASUWT, it is only since 2015 that the union has adopted its name in the short form using &quot;only the initials&quot; NASUWT and subtitled &#x27;The Teachers&#x27; Union&#x27;. The change reflected that 84 per cent of its members were now women and it was effectively able to remove from its name the now archaic term &#x27;schoolmasters&#x27;.

== Industrial relations, bargaining and strikes ==
The union as the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) with 21,000 members attempt to seek representation in national pay negotiations known as the Burnham Committee was rejected in 1960. The Burnham Committees however were dominated by representatives of the much larger National Union of Teachers (NUT) with a membership of 201,000.

However following a series of strikes and rallies the NAS achieved recognition for national pay bargaining on the Burnham Committees in 1962. Despite a successful campaign, the NUT continued to hold the majority of seats. In 1969 for instance, the NUT had 15 members on the Teachers’ Panel, with the NAS holding the 2 seats it achieved on joining the Committee in 1962. The NUT general secretary also held the joint secretaryship of the main &quot;Burnham Committees&quot; and the leadership of their &quot;Teachers&#x27; Panels&quot; for most of their existence.

By the mid-1980s, the pay rises for teachers of the previous decade had been considerably eroded by inflation In February, 1985 the NASUWT along with other teaching unions withdrew &#x27;goodwill&#x27; in pursuit of higher pay. Members refused to supervise at lunchtimes, attend meetings with parents outside school hours, or cover for absent colleagues. The dispute escalated and a series of strikes followed for a period of the next two years.

By 1987 the divisions over strategy with other unions, notably the NUT, brought the dispute to an end. The result was the &quot;1987 Teachers&#x27; Pay and Conditions Act&quot;, which abolished the national pay negotiations and replaced them with an &quot;Interim Advisory Committee on School Teachers&#x27; Pay and Conditions&quot;, on which the unions had no representation. This was in turn replaced in 1991 by &quot;The School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB).&quot; An independent body to examine and report on such matters relating to the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales.

==Social partnership and work force reform==

From 2003 to 2010 the NASUWT was involved in &quot;social partnership&quot; – a programme of meetings between union leaders, the Labour government and employers&#x27; organisations. The meetings were initially to discuss pay and workforce issues but developed into a forum for broader discussion on policy proposals. The National Union of Teachers chose not to participate in social partnership. The NASUWT argues that social partnership brought about benefits to teachers&#x27; terms and conditions through the &quot;National Agreement – Raising Standards, Tackling Workload&quot;, especially the introduction of defined planning and assessment time for all teachers.

Social partnership was confined to the Labour government, and did not continue after the establishment of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Instead, the union lodged a formal trade dispute with the government over workload, conditions of service, pensions, and jobs. In November 2011, members of the NASUWT voted by a 4-to-1 margin (on a 39% turnout) to take strike action, and begin working to the letter of their contracts. The NASUWT set aside historical differences with the National Union of Teachers; a joint declaration in May 2012 led to a co-ordinated work-to-rule and strike action in autumn 2013.
==NASUWT campaigns==

The NASUWT has initiated a number of influential campaigns in recent years, including a campaign leading to the abolition of a code of conduct proposed by the General Teaching Council, a campaign recognising the effects of cyberbullying, a campaign to preserve the anonymity of teachers from malicious or false allegations, and a campaign to bar members of the British National Party from the teaching profession.

After 2010, the union joined campaigns against the coalition government. It asserted that &quot;the Education Act 2011 heralded the break-up of the entire state education service&quot; and subsequently lobbied under the slogan &quot;Reclaim the promise&quot;, harking back to the Education Act 1944. NASUWT encouraged its members to join marches sponsored by the TUC, and participated in the Robin Hood tax campaign.

==Location==
The headquarters is situated by the Lickey Hills Country Park in North Worcestershire which borders the southern edge of the City of Birmingham (NASUWT Rose Hill, Rednal, Birmingham B45 8RS). Built as a businessman&#x27;s private house in 1897, Hillscourt was a preparatory school before the union bought it in 1971. Its library was named the Terry Casey Library in 1983 to commemorate Casey&#x27;s 20 years as general secretary. The union also has nine regional centres in England, and national centres each of Northern Ireland, Wales/Cymru and Scotland.

<doc id="989094" wikidata="Q30892495" url="?curid=989094" title="Discursive psychology">
<text>Discursive psychology (DP) is a form of discourse analysis that focuses on psychological themes in talk, text, and images.

As a counter to mainstream psychology&#x27;s treatment of discourse as a &quot;mirror&quot; for people&#x27;s expressions of thoughts, intentions, motives, etc., DP&#x27;s founders made the case for picturing it instead as a &quot;construction yard&quot; wherein all such presumptively prior and independent notions of thought and so on were built from linguistic materials, topicalised and, in various less direct ways, handled and managed. Here, the study of the psychological implies commitment not to the inner life of the mind, but rather, to the written and spoken practices within which people invoked, implicitly or explicitly, notions precisely like &quot;the inner life of the mind&quot;. Discursive psychology therefore starts with psychological phenomena as things that are constructed, attended to, and understood in interaction. An evaluation, say, may be constructed using particular phrases and idioms, responded to by the recipient (as a compliment perhaps) and treated as the expression of a strong position. In discursive psychology, the focus is not on psychological matters somehow leaking out into interaction; rather, interaction is the primary site where psychological issues are live. It is philosophically opposed to more traditional cognitivist approaches to language. It uses studies of naturally occurring conversation to critique the way that topics have been conceptualised and treated in psychology.

==History==
The origins of what is now termed &quot;discursive psychology&quot; can arguably be traced to the late 1980s, and the collaborative research and analysis sessions that took place as part of Loughborough University&#x27;s then newly formed Discourse and Rhetoric Group (DARG). A key landmark was the publication of Jonathan Potter and Margaret Wetherell&#x27;s classic text &quot;Discourse and social psychology: Beyond attitudes and behaviour&quot; in 1987. Charles Antaki, writing in the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot;, described the impact of this book:

The field itself was originally labeled as DP during the early 1990s by Derek Edwards and Potter at Loughborough University. It has since been developed and extended by a number of others, including (but by no means limited to): Charles Antaki, Malcolm Ashmore, Frederick Attenborough, Bethan Benwell, Steve Brown, Carly Butler, Derek Edwards, Alexa Hepburn, Eric Laurier, Hedwig te Molder, Sue Speer, Liz Stokoe, Cristian Tileaga, Sally Wiggins and Sue Wilkinson. Discursive psychology draws on the philosophy of mind of Gilbert Ryle and the later Ludwig Wittgenstein, the rhetorical approach of Michael Billig, the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the conversation analysis of Harvey Sacks and the sociology of scientific knowledge of those like Mike Mulkay, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour. The term &quot;discursive psychology&quot; was designed partly to indicate that there was not just a methodological shift at work in this form of analysis, but also, and at the same time, that it involved some fairly radical theoretical rethinking.

==Study==
Discursive psychology conducts studies of both naturally occurring and experimentally engineered human interaction that offer new ways of understanding topics in social and cognitive psychology such as memory, identity and attitude. Although discursive psychology subscribes to a different view of human mentality than is advanced by mainstream psychology, Edwards and Potter&#x27;s work was originally motivated by their dissatisfaction with how psychology had treated discourse. In many psychological studies, the things people (subjects) say are treated as windows (with varying degrees of opacity) into their minds. Talk is seen as (and, in experimental psychology and protocol analysis, used as) descriptions of people&#x27;s mental content. In contrast, discursive psychology treats talk as social action; that is, we say what we do as a means of, and in the course of, doing things in a socially meaningful world. Thus, the questions that it makes sense to ask also change.

==DP-in-action: an illustration==
DP can be illustrated with an example from Edwards&#x27; research on script formulations. Traditional social psychology treats scripts as mentally encoded templates that guide action. Discursive psychology focuses on the foundational issue of how a description is built to present a course of action as following from a standardized routine. Take the following example from a couple counselling session (the transcription symbols here were developed by Gail Jefferson). The Counsellor says: &quot;before you moved over here how was the marriage&quot;. After a delay of about half a second, Connie, the wife who is being jointly counselled, replies &quot;Oh to me all along, right up to now, my marriage was rock solid. Rock solid = We had arguments like everybody else had arguments, but to me there was no major problems.&quot; One thing that discursive psychologists would be interested in would be the way that Connie depicts the arguments that she and her partner have as the routine kind of arguments that everybody has. While arguments might be thought as a problem with a marriage, Connie &quot;script formulates&quot; them as actually characteristic of a &quot;rock solid&quot; marriage. Action and interaction is accomplished as orderly in interactions of this kind. Discursive psychology focuses on the locally organized practices for constructing the world to serve relevant activities (in this case managing the live question of who is to blame and who needs to change in the counselling). In the discursive psychological vision, scripts are an inseparable part of the practical and moral world of accountability.

==Applications of DP: spoken and textual approaches==
In the past few years, one particular strand of discursive psychology has focused its analytic gaze on spoken interaction. As a consequence, it has relied heavily on (but also contributed to the development of) the principles and practices of conversation analysis. Focusing on material drawn from real world situations such as relationship counselling, child protection helplines, neighbour disputes and family mealtimes, it has asked questions such as: How does a party in relationship counselling construct the problem as something that the other party needs to work on? How does a child protection officer working on a child protection helpline manage the possibly competing tasks of soothing a crying caller and simultaneously eliciting evidence sufficient for social services to intervene to help an abused child? And what makes a parent&#x27;s request to a child to eat different from a directive, and different in turn from a threat?

Although most recent DP oriented studies take talk-in-interaction as their primary data, it is not difficult to locate another strand of DP-related research in which texts are approached as sites for the active literary/narratorial management of matters such as agency, intent, doubt, culpability, belief, prejudice, and so on. One of the founding studies for this kind of textual approach was &quot;Who killed the Princess? Description and Blame in the British Print Press&quot; by Derek Edwards and Katie MacMillan. The &quot;generally applicable discourse analytic approach&quot; articulated and demonstrated therein has proved particularly useful for the study of media texts. Whereas traditional DP studies explore the situated, occasioned, rhetorical use of our rich common sense psychological lexicon across various forms of spoken data, this newer form of textual DP shows that and how authors use that same lexicon in order to present themselves (or others) as individuals and/or members of larger collectives that are (ab)normal, (ir)rational, (un)reasonable, etc. This approach has proved particularly productive in an age marked by the growth in usage of social media, SMS texts, photo messaging apps, blogs/vlogs, YouTube, interactive websites (etc.): never before have so many opportunities for explicitly public, accountably interactional and rhetorically motivated invocations of psychological terms been available to so many people.

<text>Terry Ballantine Bisson (February 12, 1942 – January 10, 2024) was an American science fiction and fantasy author. He was best known for his short stories, including &quot;Bears Discover Fire&quot;, which won the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award, and &quot;They&#x27;re Made Out of Meat&quot;.

==Biography==
Terry Ballantine Bisson was born on February 12, 1942, in Madisonville, Kentucky, and raised in Owensboro, Kentucky.

While a student at Grinnell College (Iowa) in 1961, Bisson was one of a group of students who traveled to Washington, D.C., during the Cuban Missile Crisis supporting U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;peace race&quot;. Kennedy invited the group to the White House (the first time protesters had ever been so recognized) and they met for several hours with McGeorge Bundy. The group received wide press coverage, and this event is regarded as the start of the student peace movement. Over time, they came to be known as the Grinnell 14.

After leaving Grinnell College, Bisson graduated from the University of Louisville in 1964. He lived &quot;on and off&quot; in New York City for most of the next four decades, before moving to Oakland, California, in 2002. He became a &quot;working&quot; writer in 1981. A self-identified member of the New Left, he operated Jacobin Books, a &quot;revolutionary&quot; mail-order book service, from 1985 to 1990, in partnership with Judy Jensen.

Bisson was married three times. He and his first wife, Deirdre Holst, had three children. His second marriage was to Mary Corey. Bisson married his &quot;longtime companion&quot; Judy Jensen on December 24, 2004; the couple had one daughter, and Bisson was stepfather to Jensen&#x27;s two children.

In the 1960s, early in his career, Bisson collaborated on several comic book stories with Clark Dimond, and he edited Major Publications&#x27; black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Web of Horror&quot;, but left before the fourth issue.

Bisson&#x27;s first novel was &quot;Wyrldmaker&quot;, a science fiction novel influenced by James Blish&#x27;s &quot;The Seedling Stars&quot;. His next novel was &quot;Talking Man&quot; (1986), a fantasy about the titular wizard living in the contemporary American South.

In 1996, he wrote two three-part comic book adaptations of &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Avalon&quot;, the first two books in Roger Zelazny&#x27;s Amber series.

In 1997, after Walter M. Miller, Jr.&#x27;s death in 1996, Bisson completed Miller&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot;, the sequel to Miller&#x27;s classic 1960 novel &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;.

Bisson died in the early morning on January 10, 2024, at the age of 81.

<text>Tai Situpa (; from ) is one of the oldest lineages of tulkus (reincarnated lamas) in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism In Tibetan Buddhism tradition, Kenting Tai Situpa is considered as emanation of Bodhisattva Maitreya and Guru Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) and who has been incarnated numerous times as Indian and Tibetan yogis since the time of the historical Buddha.

== History ==
The Tai Situpa is one of the highest-ranking lamas of the Karma Kagyu lineage. Chokyi Gyaltsen was the first to bear the title &quot;Grand Situ&quot; (), conferred upon him in 1407 by the Yongle Emperor of Ming China. He was a close disciple of Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama, who appointed him abbot of Karma Goen, the Karmapa&#x27;s principal monastery at the time. The full title bestowed was &quot;Kenting Naya Tang Nyontse Geshetse Tai Situpa&quot; which is shortened to &quot;Kenting Tai Situ&quot;. The full title means &quot;far reaching, unshakable, great master, holder of the command&quot;. The 9th Karmapa bestowed the 5th Kenting Tai Situpa a Red Vajra Crown of Radiant Gold, which mirrored the Karmapa&#x27;s own Black Vajra Crown. The Red Crown symbolizes the inseparability of the Karmapa and Kenting Tai Situpa. Through seeing the Red Crown, which is presented in a ceremony even today by the Kenting Tai Situpa, one is instantly and irreversibly set onto the path of enlightenment and receives the blessing of the Bodhisattva Maitreya.

The current, 12th Tai Situpa, Pema Tönyö Nyinje, was born in a farming family named Liyultsang in 1954 in the village of Palmey, which is part of Palyul () or Baiyü County, Sichuan, China that was formerly part of the Kingdom of Derge. The Palpung Thupten Chokhorling monastery in Derge was founded by the 8th Tai Situpa &quot;Situ Panchen&quot; in 1727, where presently all the traditional Buddhist teachings are taught to the monks and has preserved traditional printing centre for the Buddhist teaching scrolls.

At the age of twenty-two, the 12th Tai Situpa founded his own new monastic seat, Palpung Sherabling Monastery, Himachal Pradesh, in Northeast India providing traditional Buddhist teachings, astronomy, traditional Tibetan medicine curriculum, higher Tibetan Buddhist university teaching (Shedra), primary teachings to young students, sports facility for students for physical fitness, traditional Tibetan herbs medicine garden, medical clinic , old age home and has accommodations for students. Palpung Sherabling Monastery currently has approximately 1000 monks; 250 are enrolled in the monastic university curriculum on the premises. Palpung Yeshe Rabgyeling Nun Monastery is located near the city of Manali, in the Bunthar town has about 200 nuns. The Monastery also offers the traditional Kagyu three-year retreat for both monks and nuns on the compound. The Palpung congregation[10] consists of monasteries and temples throughout some Chinese and Tibetan districts. Palpung Congregation also has branch institutions in Europe, USA, Canada Oceania and Asia. The 12th Tai Situpa traveled widely, making his first visit to the West in 1981 to Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre in Scotland.

The 12th Tai Situpa was instrumental in recognizing Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa based on a handwritten letter he says was given to him by the 16th Karmapa before he died. This letter was accepted as authentic by all the main Karma Kagyu heart-sons of the 16th Karmapa, including the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche (with the one exception of the 14th Zhamarpa). The 17th Karmapa, whom he and 12th Gyaltsab Rinpoche enthroned at the Tsurphu Monastery the traditional ancient seat of the Karmapa outside Lhasa in August 1992. He also recognized Choseng Trungpa, born on February 6, 1989, in Chamdo County, Tibet Autonomous Region, as the reincarnation of Chögyam Trungpa.

<doc id="989102" wikidata="Q3121250" url="?curid=989102" title="Wilno, Ontario">
<text>Wilno is a settlement in the Township Municipality of Madawaska Valley, Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada.

==Geography==
Wilno is nestled in the rolling, picturesque terrain of the Madawaska valley which was largely shaped during the demise of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the end of the last North American Ice Age.

==History==
Wilno is the first and oldest Polish-Kashubian settlement in Canada. Most of the original settlers in the area came around 1858 from the Polish cultural region of Kashubia. (Prussia had annexed the region from Poland in 1795, but it is now part of Poland again.) They are an integral part of the Kashubian diaspora.

One of the reasons that they chose the area was that the landscape reminded them of their original homes.
Wilno&#x27;s namesake was the city of Vilnius, known in Polish as &quot;Wilno&quot;, which was then in Russian Empire in area that used to belong to Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and is now the capital of Lithuania. The city was a birthplace of Reverend Ludwik Dembski, who was a prominent community spiritual leader and town founder, who would not have wanted the town named after himself. Therefore, the townsfolk, grateful for his contributions to their town, may have suggested the name of Wilno.

The St. Stanislaus Kostka Church was built in 1875, destroyed by fire in 1936 and rebuilt as Saint Mary - Our Lady of Czestochowa. later renamed St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church. The first general store and post office was initially operated by Adam Prince, who became the community&#x27;s first postmaster in 1885; the settlement was initially named Princetown before being renamed Wilno. Flora&#x27;s Store was started by Flora Bank in 1937; it was destroyed by fire in 1940 but rebuilt. The business went through several owners and changes but was closed down in 2015.
In 1894, the Canadian Atlantic Railroad arrived in the Madawaska Valley. Previously, John Rudolphus Booth&#x27;s Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway ran through the town mainly serving the lumber industry. The first hotel near the Wilno rail station was the &quot;Stopping Place.&quot; Anew owner added more rooms and a dining room, and renamed it the &quot;Exchange Hotel.&quot; Subsequent owners modified the property, which became the &quot;Wilno Tavern&quot; in 1979 and the &quot;Wilno Tavern Restaurant&quot; more recently. The restaurant remained in operation as of 2020, and Corinne Higgins has owned it since 1981.

The former train route has now been redeveloped into a recreational path. The former train station has an early settler building and museum presenting the early history of the town. The museum and open air wooden skansen (Polish: &quot;open-air museum&quot;) contain the history of the first Kashubian people as well as their immigration to Canada, freedom and, after many hardships, their settlement journey to the Wilno area. The Polish Kashub Heritage Museum &amp; Skansen opened in 2002. It is open to visitors during July and August. In May, the annual Kashub Day event is held here.


A professor of Slavic Languages, Jan L. Perkowski, reported on rumours of vampires in the Kashubian culture in a study completed in 1969, and published in a paper titled &quot;Vampires, Dwarves, and Witches among the Ontario Kashubs&quot;. According to the professor, the Ontario Kashubs believed that one &quot;must open the tomb of the vampire at midnight, and drive a long nail into his forehead, or, better still, cut off his head with a sharp spade and put it between his feet...&quot;. In 1973, a Catholic priest in Wilno told CBC News that &quot;We get a big laugh out of it, we know the people who have manufactured the story just by reading it... My impression is that [Perkowski] probably stuck a microphone under their noses and to get rid of him they&#x27;d made up these tales&quot;.

In April 2010, Poland&#x27;s Prime Minister Donald Tusk agreed to visit Wilno but an airplane crash, the Smolensk air disaster, that took the life of President Lech Kaczyński, and that of 95 others, led to cancellation of the plan. Tusk visited Wilno in May 2012, commenting that he was the &quot;first Polish prime minister to meet with the minority living there and cultivating its customs since the 19th century&quot;. He toured the Catholic cemetery and later said, &quot;We felt as if we were visiting the graves of our dearest, our relatives, our beloved, because these names, these figures, those stories were our stories.&quot;

===Triple murder===
In September 2015 three womenCarol Culleton, 66, Anastasia Kuzyk, 36, and Nathalie Warmerdam, 46were murdered in and near Wilno. The killer, Basil Borutski, was convicted of the crimes in 2017.

===Historical plaque===
The government of Ontario erected a historical plaque in Wilno, providing these specifics:The first group of Polish immigrants to Canada, some 300 in number, established a settlement in this area in 1864. Adverse social conditions and political unrest in their partitioned homeland had encouraged them to leave. They cleared the land and rapidly established a thriving agricultural community. During the 1880s the village founded here was called Wilno after the birthplace of the Reverend Ludwik Dembski one of their spiritual leaders. In 1875 the parish of Wilno was organized and a chapel dedicated to the polish saint Stanislaus Kostka, was built. The Canadian Atlantic Railway linked Wilno with Ottawa in 1894. This district, which received a new wave of Polish immigrants in the early 1900s, retains much of its cultural heritage.

== Annual Chicken Supper on the Labour Day Weekend ==

This supper has been an annual event since 1936. Approximately 2,000 people have been served each year during Labour Day Weekend. The food is authentic Kaszebe–Polish fare; one source states that it includes &quot;boiled chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, fresh vegetables, such as carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickles, and of course choices of apple, raisin, and coconut cream pies&quot;. In 2019, some 3,000 meals were served by volunteers; the 550 pies were also baked by volunteers.

<doc id="989111" wikidata="Q6410982" url="?curid=989111" title="King's Island, Limerick">
<text>King&#x27;s Island () is an area of central Limerick, Ireland. The area is often referred to colloquially as &quot;The Island&quot; and consists of two distinct areas, &quot;Englishtown&quot; and &quot;St Mary&#x27;s Park&quot;. The historical city of Limerick known as &quot;Englishtown&quot; is located on the southern end and St Mary&#x27;s Park; a local authority housing estate is located on the northern end.

The island is formed from a distributary of the River Shannon. The Abbey River diverts from the Shannon before meeting it again at a confluence near the Potato Market.

The island probably took its name after the 13th-century English King John&#x27;s Castle was built. However, a 150AD map by Ptolemy shows a place called &#x27;Regia&#x27; at the same site as King&#x27;s Island, and history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area. The island&#x27;s location offers an ideal defensive position at a natural river crossing.

==Englishtown==
In times past, the ancient city of Limerick itself was entirely contained in the area now known as Englishtown as a walled city. The Vikings established the city in this area following the Viking Invasion of Ireland. After the Norman Invasion of Ireland, the city was taken by Norman or Old English settlers. It is from this time that the area became referred to as &quot;Englishtown&quot; and also to distinguish it from &quot;Irishtown&quot; south of the Abbey River which was populated by native Irish. It was during the Norman Conquest that many of the city&#x27;s landmarks were built in this district such as the 13th century King John&#x27;s Castle and the 800-year-old St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. Nicholas Street and Mary Street on the island formed the medieval city centre of Limerick and are perhaps the oldest streets in the city. Samuel Lewis writing in 1837 in his &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; describes Limerick&#x27;s old city of &quot;Englishtown&quot; as resembling the city of Rouen, Normandy with the housing built in Flemish fashion. Even by then though there is evidence the district was in decline as he describes the area as exhibiting a &#x27;dirty &amp; neglected appearance&#x27;. Following the development of Newtown Pery the city centre shifted south to the present day centre of the city and the Englishtown area lost its position as the fashionable area of the city. By the late 18th Century the old continental style cramped lofty Dutch &amp; Flemish houses that once characterised the area were transformed into tenements and rented to Limerick&#x27;s poorest. 

Englishtown became characterised by poverty, slum living and squalor. All of the slums were cleared in the early to mid 20th Century, resulting in the loss of most of the areas historical built heritage such as the collection of Flemish townhouses, Ireton&#x27;s Castle, the Exchange building, the Tholsel amongst much more. 

In the late 20th century, corporation houses that were on the site of the modern-day King John&#x27;s castle were demolished and an architectural excavation commenced, prior to its significant redevelopment. In the early 21st century, the Kings Island and Englishtown areas redeveloped into a tourist spot, highlighting the significant historical elements behind the area and embracing the historic culture of the area.

==St Mary&#x27;s Park==

St Mary&#x27;s Park is a local authority housing estate located on the northern part of the island known as the Island Field. As one of the most deprived areas in Limerick city, it is earmarked as part of the overall Limerick city regeneration project which will see the estate replanned and rebuilt with greater integration to the city.

==Landmarks==

As the most historic and ancient part of Limerick, King&#x27;s Island and the Englishtown area contains many notable buildings and landmarks such as:

* King John&#x27;s Castle, Castle Street, dates from the 13th Century
* St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Bridge Street, dates from the 14th Century
* Old Bishop&#x27;s Palace, (now headquarters of Limerick Civic Trust), Castle Street, c1750
* St Munchin&#x27;s Church (now the Island Theatre Company), Church Street, c1825
* Villier&#x27;s Almhouses, Verdant Place, c1820
* (Royal) Military Cemetery, King&#x27;s Island, which dates from 1856
* Bourke&#x27;s Castle, Athlunkard Street
* Fanning&#x27;s Castle, Mary Street, c1641

* Exchange Walls (formerly the Exchange Building), Nicholas Street
* Ruins of the old Dominican Friary, Bishop Street
* Limerick City Hall &amp; Civic Buildings, Merchants Quay
* North Munster Masonic Centre, Castle Street
* Baal&#x27;s Bridge dates from 1830 replacing an earlier structure (which connected Irishtown to Englishtown in medieval times). The bridge is also known for the Baal&#x27;s Bridge Square. When the new bridge was constructed in 1830 an old brass square of Freemasonry symbolism was found in the foundations of the original bridge with a date inscribed to 1517. The Square is reputed to be one of the earliest Masonic items found in the world.

<text>The Selgovae (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Selgowī&quot;) were a Celtic tribe of the late 2nd century AD who lived in what is now Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire, on the southern coast of Scotland. They are mentioned briefly in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, and there is no other historical record of them. Their cultural and ethnic affinity is commonly assumed to have been Brittonic.

Assertions that the Solway Firth preserves the name of the Selgovae are without foundation. &#x27;Solway&#x27; is Anglo-Saxon from the thirteenth century (&quot;sol&quot; = &#x27;mud&#x27;, &quot;wæth&quot; = &#x27;ford&#x27;), and this was the name of the main crossing at Eskmouth at that time. The firth has been known by various names in the past, and this one happened to be the survivor.

== The historical record ==

=== Ptolemy ===

The sole record of the Selgovae and their towns is their mention by Ptolemy in c. AD 150. Their name appears in the 8th century &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; as &#x27;Segloes&#x27;, but the document here is taken to be an imperfect copy of classical sources such as Ptolemy, and not an independent historical reference.

The Novantae are unique among the peoples that Ptolemy names in that their location is reliably known to have been in Galloway due to the way he named several readily identifiable physical features. Since the Selgovae were adjacent to them, their homeland is similarly known.

Ptolemy said that the towns of the Selgovae were &quot;Carbantorigum&quot;, &quot;Uxellum&quot;, &quot;Corda&quot;, and &quot;Trimontium&quot;. However, there were no towns as such in the area at that time, so he was probably referring to Roman military camps and native strong points such as duns. In the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; the town names appear as &quot;Carbantium&quot;, &quot;Uxela&quot;, &quot;Corda&quot;, and &quot;Trimuntium&quot;, respectively, and the towns are given in a list that does not associate any of the towns with any particular people.

Efforts have been made to determine the locations of the towns, but there is not enough information available to reach any degree of certainty, and the locations suggested are little more than guesswork.
In the 19th century, &quot;Carbantorigum&quot; was thought to be the Motte of Urr by Skene, and Rhys thought the name derived from &quot;Carbantorion&quot; (&quot;chariot town&quot;). &quot;Uxellum&quot; was at Wardlaw Hill at Caerlaverock according to Skene and Horsley; it was noted that the name sounds like Welsh &quot;uchel&quot; (&quot;high&quot;) or Gaelic &quot;uas&quot;, &quot;uasal&quot;. &quot;Corda&quot; was at Sanquhar, according to Skene. &quot;Trimontium&quot; was at Birrenswark Hill, according to Skene, who says its name probably represents Welsh &quot;Tref mynydd&quot; (&quot;Town on a Mountain&quot;).

Rhys, agreeing with Wyntoun, thought that &#x27;Selgovae&#x27; means &#x27;the hunters&#x27; (, modern ; , modern &#x27;hunting&#x27;).

=== Roman Era ===

Archaeological evidence indicates that the Selgovae lived in two principal settlement types: stone-built huts and so-called &quot;scooped enclosures&quot;, some of which were abandoned in the 1st century AD while others were established in the 2nd century and developed into multivallate structures. They had possibly lived in the area since the Bronze Age, and certainly during the pre-Roman Iron Age. The pattern of forts subsequently established in the area by the Romans suggests that the Selgovae lived in a number of distinct communities and probably had some degree of tribal and political organisation, perhaps influenced by individuals who had fled the Roman advance further south. They are thought to have had a tribal centre at Eildon Hill North near Melrose. They built a significant number of hillforts, more so than their neighbours, which may explain why the Romans targeted them before the relatively less organised and therefore less threatening tribes to the west and north.

In his account of the campaigns of Gnaeus Julius Agricola (governor 78–84), Tacitus says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay, campaigning against the peoples there. He did not return until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the lands that he had conquered.

The territory of the Selgovae was substantially planted with Roman forts at this time, at Broomholm, Blatobulgium (Birrens), Ward Law, Milton, Drumlanrig, Dalswinton, and Glenlochar on the eastern bank of the River Dee, which was perhaps the boundary between the Selgovae and the neighbouring Novantae. This suggests (but does not confirm) that the Selgovae were among the British peoples who had strongly resisted Roman occupation. This is in contrast to the neighbouring Novantae, where there are no signs of Roman occupation save the fortlet at Gatehouse of Fleet, in the southeast of their territory.

Following the reorganisation of northern Roman Britain and the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (c. 122), the only Roman forts among the Selgovae were at Birrens and Netherby. However, with the construction of the Antonine Wall and the re-occupation of territory north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (c. 142), the territory of the Selgovae was again heavily planted with Roman forts, at Netherby, Broomholm, Birrens, Burnswark, Raeburnfoot, Shieldhill, Milton, Drumlanrig, Dalswinton, Carzield, Lantonside, and Glenlochar. There were no Roman forts planted in the territory of the neighbouring Novantae.

When Rome largely abandoned its occupation of territory north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall under the reorganisation of Marcus Aurelius (c. 175), they nevertheless retained forts at Birrens and Netherby, though there would never again be a large-scale military occupation of the territory of the Selgovae. Rome permanently abandoned the area by 370.

=== Cultural affinity ===
The ethnic and cultural affinity of the Selgovae is assumed to have been Brittonic and there have been suggestions that they were an integral part of the tribe of the Brigantes.

Archaeological evidence is scant, but it includes a Roman-era figure and inscription found at Birrens (the Roman Blatobulgium) that was dedicated to &#x27;Brigantia&#x27;, similar to dedications found in known Brigantian territory in Cumbria and Yorkshire. Tacitus says that the Brigantes were a large tribe, and artefacts associated with the Brigantes have been found across the region just north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, both in England and in Scottish Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.

The Brigantes were troublesome to Roman rule, strongly resisting initial Roman occupation and frequently rising in efforts to throw off Roman rule. The Roman response was overwhelming force and the subsequent heavy plantation of forts of occupation. The heavy plantation of forts in the territory of the Selgovae is similar to the Roman occupation of the Brigantes and unlike Roman treatment of other neighbouring peoples such as the Novantae and Votadini, who were never known to be at war with the Romans, and who were not heavily occupied.

Much later history, better recorded, shows that the territory of the Selgovae was continually associated with Cumbria (homeland of the Brigantes) and Alt Clud (homeland of the Damnonii), both of which are known to have been Britonnic in culture and language.

== Contradicting Ptolemy ==
Ptolemy&#x27;s placement of the Selgovaean town of Trimontium was accepted to be somewhere along the southern coast of Scotland until William Roy (1726–1790) placed it far to the east at Eildon Hills, near Newstead. Roy was trying to follow an itinerary given in the 1757 &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;, and moving Ptolemy&#x27;s Trimontium made the itinerary seem more logical according to his historical work, &quot;Military Antiquities of the Romans in North Britain&quot; (1790, published posthumously in 1793). Roy did not alter Ptolemy&#x27;s placement of the Selgovae in southern Scotland, but chose to assign Trimontium to a different people who were described in &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;.

When &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot; was debunked as a fraud in 1845, Roy&#x27;s misguided placement of Trimontium was retained by some historians, though he was no longer cited for his contribution. Furthermore, some historians not only accepted Roy&#x27;s placement of Trimontium, but also returned the town to the Selgovae by moving their territory such that they would be near Eildon Hills. Ptolemy&#x27;s placement of the Novantae in Galloway was retained, and since Ptolemy said that they were adjacent to the Selgovae, Novantae territory was greatly expanded beyond Galloway to be consistent with this thesis, which survives in a number of modern histories.

The result is that an &#x27;error correction&#x27; to the sole legitimate historical reference (Ptolemy), made so that a fictional itinerary in &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot; would seem more logical, is retained; and the sole legitimate historical reference is further &#x27;corrected&#x27; by moving the Selgovae far from their only known location.

While Roy&#x27;s historical work is largely ignored due to his unknowing reliance on a fraudulent source, his maps and drawings are untainted, and continue to be held in the highest regard. Roy&#x27;s work is highly supported by the town of Selkirk.

<doc id="989119" wikidata="Q141568" url="?curid=989119" title="The Return of the Native">
<text>The Return of the Native is the sixth published novel by English author Thomas Hardy. It first appeared in the magazine &quot;Belgravia&quot;, a publication known for its sensationalism, and was presented in twelve monthly installments from 9 January to 19 December 1878. Because of the novel&#x27;s controversial themes, Hardy had some difficulty finding a publisher; reviews, however, though somewhat mixed, were generally positive. In the twentieth century, &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; became one of Hardy&#x27;s most popular and highly regarded novels.

==Plot summary==
=== Book First: The Three Women ===
The novel takes place entirely in the environs of Egdon Heath, and, with the exception of the epilogue, &quot;Aftercourses&quot;, covers exactly a year and a day. The narrative begins on the evening of Guy Fawkes Night as Diggory Venn is slowly crossing the heath with his van, which is being drawn by ponies. In his van is a passenger. When darkness falls, the country folk light bonfires on the surrounding hills, emphasising the pagan spirit of the heath and its denizens.

Venn is a reddleman; he travels the country supplying farmers with a red mineral called reddle (dialect term for red ochre) that farmers use to mark their sheep. Although his trade has stained him red from head to foot, underneath his devilish colouring he is a handsome, shrewd, well-meaning young man. His passenger is a young woman named Thomasin Yeobright, whom Venn is taking home. Earlier that day, Thomasin had planned to marry Damon Wildeve, a local innkeeper known for his fickleness; however, an inconsistency in the marriage licence delayed the marriage. Thomasin, in distress, ran after the reddleman&#x27;s van and asked him to take her home. Venn himself is in love with Thomasin, and unsuccessfully wooed her two years before. Now, although he believes Wildeve is unworthy of her love, he is so devoted to her that he is willing to help her secure the man of her choice.

At length, Venn reaches Bloom&#x27;s End, the home of Thomasin&#x27;s aunt, Mrs. Yeobright. She is a good woman, if somewhat proud and inflexible, and she wants the best for Thomasin. In former months she opposed her niece&#x27;s choice of husband, and publicly forbade the banns; now, since Thomasin has compromised herself by leaving town with Wildeve and returning unmarried, the best outcome Mrs. Yeobright can envision is for the postponed marriage to be duly solemnised as soon as possible. She and Venn both begin working on Wildeve to make sure he keeps his promise to Thomasin.

Wildeve, however, is still preoccupied with Eustacia Vye, an exotically beautiful young woman living with her grandfather in a lonely house on Egdon Heath. Eustacia is a black-haired, queenly woman, whose Italian father came from Corfu, and who grew up in Budmouth, a fashionable seaside resort. She holds herself aloof from most of the heathfolk; they, in turn, consider her an oddity, and some even think she is a witch. She is nothing like Thomasin, who is sweet-natured. She loathes the heath, yet roams it constantly, carrying a spyglass and an hourglass. The previous year, she and Wildeve were lovers; however, even during the height of her passion for him, she knew she only loved him because there was no better object available. When Wildeve broke off the relationship to court Thomasin, Eustacia&#x27;s interest in him briefly returned. The two meet on Guy Fawkes night, and Wildeve asks her to run off to America with him. She demurs.

=== Book Second: The Arrival ===
Eustacia drops Wildeve when Mrs. Yeobright&#x27;s son Clym, a successful diamond merchant, returns from Paris to his native Egdon Heath. Although he has no plans to return to Paris or the diamond trade and is, in fact, planning to become a schoolmaster for the rural poor, Eustacia sees him as a way to escape the hated heath and begin a grander, richer existence in a glamorous new location. With some difficulty, she arranges to meet Clym, and the two soon fall in love. When Mrs. Yeobright objects, Clym quarrels with her; later, she quarrels with Eustacia as well.
When he sees that Eustacia is lost to him, Wildeve marries Thomasin, who gives birth to a daughter the next summer. Clym and Eustacia also marry and move to a small cottage five miles away, where they enjoy a brief period of happiness. The seeds of rancour soon begin to germinate, however: Clym studies night and day to prepare for his new career as a schoolmaster while Eustacia clings to the hope that he&#x27;ll give up the idea and take her abroad. Instead, he nearly blinds himself with too much reading, then further mortifies his wife by deciding to eke out a living, at least temporarily, as a furze-cutter. Eustacia, her dreams blasted, finds herself living in a hut on the heath, chained by marriage to a lowly labouring man.

=== Book Third: The Fascination ===
At this point, Wildeve reappears; he has unexpectedly inherited a large sum of money, and is now in a better position to fulfill Eustacia&#x27;s hopes. He comes calling on the Yeobrights in the middle of one hot August day and, although Clym is at home, he is fast asleep on the hearth after a gruelling session of furze-cutting. While Eustacia and Wildeve are talking, Mrs. Yeobright knocks on the door; she has decided to pay a courtesy call in the hopes of healing the estrangement between herself and her son. Eustacia looks out at her and then, in some alarm, ushers her visitor out at the back door. She hears Clym calling to his mother and, thinking his mother&#x27;s knocking has awakened him, remains in the garden for a few moments. When Eustacia goes back inside, she finds Clym still asleep and his mother gone. Clym, she now realises, merely cried out his mother&#x27;s name in his sleep.

=== Book Four: The Closed Door ===
Mrs Yeobright, it turns out, saw Eustacia looking out the window at her; she also saw Clym&#x27;s gear by the door, and so knew they were both at home. Now, thinking she has been deliberately barred from her son&#x27;s home, she miserably begins the long, hot walk home. Later that evening, Clym, unaware of her attempted visit, heads for Bloom&#x27;s End and on the way finds her crumpled beside the path, dying from an adder&#x27;s bite. When she expires that night from the combined effects of snake venom and heat exhaustion, Clym&#x27;s grief and remorse make him physically ill for several weeks. Eustacia, racked with guilt, dares not tell him of her role in the tragedy; when he eventually finds out from a neighbour&#x27;s child about his mother&#x27;s visit—and Wildeve&#x27;s—he rushes home to accuse his wife of murder and adultery. Eustacia refuses to explain her actions; instead, she tells him &quot;You are no blessing, my husband&quot; and reproaches him for his cruelty. She then moves back to her grandfather&#x27;s house, where she struggles with her despair while she awaits some word from Clym.

=== Book Fifth: The Discovery ===
Wildeve visits Eustacia again on Guy Fawkes night, and offers to help her get to Paris. Eustacia realises that if she lets Wildeve help her, she&#x27;ll be obliged to become his mistress. She tells him she will send him a signal by night if she decides to accept. Clym&#x27;s anger, meanwhile, has cooled and he sends Eustacia a letter the next day offering reconciliation. The letter arrives a few minutes too late; by the time her grandfather tries to give it to her, she has already signalled to Wildeve and set off through wind and rain to meet him. She walks along weeping, however, knowing she is about to break her marriage vows for a man who is unworthy of her.

Wildeve readies a horse and gig and waits for Eustacia in the dark. Thomasin, guessing his plans, sends Clym to intercept him; she also, by chance, encounters Diggory Venn as she dashes across the heath herself in pursuit of her husband. Eustacia does not appear; instead, she falls or throws herself into nearby Shadwater Weir. Clym and Wildeve hear the splash and hurry to investigate. Wildeve plunges recklessly after Eustacia without bothering to remove his coat, while Clym, proceeding more cautiously, nevertheless is also soon at the mercy of the raging waters. Venn arrives in time to save Clym, but is too late for the others. When Clym revives, he accuses himself of murdering his wife and mother.

=== Book Sixth: The Aftercourses ===
In the epilogue, Venn gives up being a reddleman to become a dairy farmer. Two years later, Thomasin marries him and they settle down happily together. Clym, now a sad, solitary figure, eventually takes up preaching.

====Alternative ending====
In a footnote towards the end of the novel in some compendium editions, Hardy writes:
==Discussion==
With its deeply flawed heroine and its (for the time) open acknowledgement of illicit sexual relationships, &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; raised some eyebrows when it first appeared as a serial in Victorian Britain. Although he intended to structure the novel into five books, thus mirroring the classical tragic format, Hardy submitted to the tastes of the serial-reading public sufficiently to tack on a happy ending for Diggory Venn and Thomasin in a sixth book, &quot;Aftercourses&quot;. In Hardy&#x27;s original conception, Venn retains his weird reddleman&#x27;s character, while Thomasin lives out her days as a widow.

Hardy&#x27;s choice of themes—sexual politics, thwarted desire, and the conflicting demands of nature and society—makes this a truly modern novel. Underlying these modern themes, however, is a classical sense of tragedy: Hardy scrupulously observes the three unities of time, place, and action and suggests that the struggles of those trying to escape their destinies will only hasten their destruction. To emphasise this main part he uses as setting an ancient heath steeped in pre-Christian history and supplies a Chorus consisting of Grandfer Cantle, Timothy Fairway, and the rest of the heathfolk. Eustacia, who manipulates fate in hopes of leaving Egdon Heath for a larger existence in Paris, instead becomes an eternal resident when she drowns in Shadwater Weir; Wildeve shares not only Eustacia&#x27;s dream of escape, but also her fate; and Clym, the would-be educational reformer, survives the Weir but lives on as a lonely, remorseful man.

Some critics—notably D. H. Lawrence—see the novel as a study of the way communities control their . In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitable bride for her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be a witch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia&#x27;s supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her in effigy. Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community&#x27;s values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time—by drowning in the weir like any woman instead of floating, witchlike—she proves her essential innocence to the community.

== Character list ==
* Clement (Clym) Yeobright—A man of about thirty who gives up a business career in Paris to return to his native Egdon Heath to become a &quot;schoolmaster to the poor and ignorant&quot; (Hardy himself gave up a successful career as a London architect and returned to his native Dorchester to become a writer). &quot;The beauty here visible would in no time be ruthlessly overrun by its parasite, thought.&quot; Clym is the &quot;native&quot; to which the book&#x27;s title refers.
* Eustacia Vye—A raven-haired young beauty who chafes against her life on the heath and longs to escape it to lead the more adventure-filled life of the world. Some of the heathfolk think she is a witch. Hardy describes her as &quot;the raw material of a divinity&quot; whose &quot;celestial imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour had proved to be somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon.&quot;
* Mrs. Yeobright—Clym’s mother, a widow of inflexible standards. Thomasin has lived with her for many years, but Clym is her only child. She strongly disapproves of Eustacia.
* Thomasin (Tamsin) Yeobright—Clym’s cousin and Mrs. Yeobright&#x27;s niece, a young girl of gentle ways and conventional expectations. In Hardy&#x27;s original manuscript, Wildeve tricks her with a false marriage to seduce her. &quot;Mrs Yeobright saw a little figure...undefended except by the power of her own hope.&quot;
* Damon Wildeve—Eustacia&#x27;s former lover and Thomasin&#x27;s first husband. He is an ex-engineer who has failed in his profession and who now keeps an inn, &quot;The Quiet Woman&quot;—so-called because its sign depicts a decapitated woman carrying her own head. He has a wandering eye and an appetite for women. &quot;A lady killing career.&quot;
* Diggory Venn—A resourceful man of twenty-four and a reddleman (a travelling seller of reddle, red chalk used for marking sheep). He selflessly protects Thomasin throughout the novel despite the fact that she refused to marry him two years before. He keeps a watchful eye on Eustacia to make sure Wildeve doesn&#x27;t go back to her. At the end, he renounces his trade to become a dairy farmer like his father, and in doing so loses the red skin. He is then seen as a suitable husband for Thomasin. Venn&#x27;s red coloration and frequent narrative references to his &#x27;Mephistophelean&#x27; or diabolical character are symbolic and important. In one particularly significant chapter (&quot;The Morning and Evening of an Eventful Day&quot;), Venn displays an increasingly unlikely string of good luck, repeatedly rolling dice and defeating a rival. This event makes Venn something of a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, as well as a quasi-magical figure. While Hardy abandons these aspects of Venn&#x27;s character by the end of the novel, during his &#x27;reddleman&#x27; phase, Venn lends elements of magical realism and what modern readers would understand to be superheroic elements to the novel.
* Captain Drew—Eustacia’s grandfather and a former naval officer (renamed Captain Vye in later editions).
* Timothy Fairway—A sententious man of middle age who is greatly respected by the other heathfolk.
* Grandfer Cantle—A somewhat senile and always lively ex-soldier of about sixty-nine.
* Christian Cantle—Grandfer Cantle&#x27;s fearful and timid thirty-one-year-old son.
* Humphrey—Clym&#x27;s eventual colleague, a furze cutter (furze is a low, prickly shrub more commonly called gorse).
* Susan Nunsuch—Eustacia&#x27;s nearest neighbour and bitterest enemy who convinces herself that Eustacia&#x27;s witchery has caused her son&#x27;s sickliness. In a memorable scene, Susan tries to protect him by making a wax effigy of Eustacia, sticking it full of pins, and melting it in her fireplace while uttering the Lord&#x27;s Prayer backward. Eustacia drowns later that night.
* Johnny Nunsuch—Susan’s son, a young boy. He encounters Mrs. Yeobright during her fatal walk home and, in obedience to her wishes, reports her last words to Clym: &quot;I am a broken-hearted woman cast off by my son.&quot;
* Charley—A sixteen-year-old boy who works for Captain Drew and who admires Eustacia, largely from afar.
* Egdon Heath—The setting for all the novel&#x27;s events; considered by some critics to be the leading character as well. It is profoundly ancient, the scene of intense but long-forgotten pagan lives. As its tumuli attest, it is also a graveyard that has swallowed countless generations of inhabitants without changing much itself. To Thomasin, Clym, and Diggory, it is a benign, natural place; in Eustacia&#x27;s eyes, it becomes a malevolent presence intent on destroying her.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Return of the Native&quot; was filmed for &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; and broadcast on television in 1994. It was filmed in Exmoor National Park. The film stars Catherine Zeta Jones as Eustacia Vye, Clive Owen as Damon Wildeve, Ray Stevenson as Clym Yeobright, and Joan Plowright as Mrs. Yeobright. Jack Gold directed.

In 2010 an Americanised film adaptation of &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; was directed by Ben Westbrook. It is set in the Appalachian Mountains in the 1930s during The Great Depression.

In 1956, a Bengali film starring Uttam Kumar and Mala Sinha titled &quot;Putrabadhu&quot; (trans:Daughter-in-Law) was released. The plot was based roughly on Hardy&#x27;s novel, albeit with a happy ending.

The novel has also been adapted for the stage several times. &quot;Dance on a Country Grave&quot; is a musical stage adaptation by Kelly Hamilton.
On 15 June 1948 a radio adaptation featuring Michael Redgrave aired on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Studio One&quot;.

==In popular culture==

* Monty Python&#x27;s 1973 record, &quot; Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot;, includes a piece called &quot;Novel Writing&quot;. In the sketch, a crowd gathers to watch Thomas Hardy begin his latest novel while enthusiastic sports announcers provide a running commentary. The novel is &quot;The Return of the Native.&quot;
* In the early 1970s, Granada Television produced a half-hour documentary in its &quot;Parade&quot; art series entitled &quot;Egdon Heath&quot; in which an actor portraying Gustav Holst walks across the barren heath while the music from his tone poem &quot;Egdon Heath&quot; is playing, and sees scenes and characters from the novel which inspired the music.
* In J. D. Salinger&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; this novel is mentioned by Holden Caulfield. Caulfield singles out the character, Eustacia Vye, a wild-spirited and confident woman, who is portrayed as an outsider in the community. Holden indicates that he likes a book that makes you feel as if the author is a friend that you could call. He adds that he’d like to call Thomas Hardy, and also that he likes &quot;that Eustacia Vye&quot;. Later he wonders what a nun would think of her.
* In 1993, the English traditional singer Johnny Collins recorded &quot;Diggery Venn the Raddle Man&quot; (sic) on his album &quot;Pedlar of Songs&quot;.
* In 1994, the Seattle band Thrones released a single entitled &quot;Reddleman&quot;.
* Kansas band The Rainmakers released a song called &quot;Reddleman Coming&quot;.
* The indie band Nightmare of You&#x27;s 2009 CD &quot;Infomaniac&quot; contains a song called &quot;Eustacia Vye&quot;.
* Musician Patrick Wolf&#x27;s song &quot;House&quot; references the novel.
* The novel is referenced in the 2014 dark thriller &quot;Kill Your Darlings&quot;.
* English fast punk band Flat Back Four have a song called &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;, based on the novel.

<text>Jonathan Potter (born 8 June 1956) is a British psychologist and Dean of the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University. He is one of the pioneers of discursive psychology.

==Life==
Jonathan Potter was born in Ashford, Kent, and spent most of his childhood in Laughton, East Sussex. His father was a school teacher, and his mother was a batik artist. He attended school in Lewes and pursued a degree in Psychology at the University of Liverpool in 1974. During his studies, he became interested in alternative therapies and the emerging critical perspectives in social psychology, influenced by the work of John Shotter, Kenneth Gergen, and Rom Harré.

Potter then completed a master&#x27;s degree in the philosophy of science at the University of Surrey, where he studied speech act theory and post-structuralism, particularly the work of Roland Barthes. His interest in the philosophy of science led him to the new sociology of scientific knowledge, engaging with the work of Harry Collins, Michael Mulkay, and Steve Woolgar.

In 1979, Potter applied for PhD funding at the University of Bath to work with Harry Collins, but the offer was withdrawn due to budget cuts. He began a part-time PhD at the University of Surrey, studying the experiences of overseas tourists in Bath. During this period, he met and started living with Margaret Wetherell, a prominent figure in British social psychology.

Potter later transferred to the University of York, working with Michael Mulkay on the sociology of scientific knowledge, focusing on scientific discourse analysis. He completed his DPhil in 1983.

Potter joined the University of St Andrews, where he taught statistics and developed a course on discourse, covering various theories and methods that influenced his later work. After four years of temporary contracts, he moved to Loughborough University in 1988. He progressed from lecturer to Professor of Discourse Analysis and eventually became Head of Department in 2010. At Loughborough, he collaborated with colleagues such as Derek Edwards, Michael Billig, Charles Antaki, and Elizabeth Stokoe.

Since 1996, Potter has lived with and collaborated with Alexa Hepburn. He has conducted workshops and short courses internationally. In 2005, his book &quot;Cognition and Conversation&quot; (co-edited with Hedwig te Molder) received the inaugural prize of the American Sociological Association&#x27;s Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis section. In 2008, he was elected to the UK Academy of Social Sciences.

==Work==

In 1984, Jonathan Potter published &quot;Social Texts and Context: Literature and Social Psychology&quot; with Margaret Wetherell and Peter Stringer. This collaboration developed alongside Potter and Wetherell&#x27;s PhD research.

Potter co-authored the influential book &quot;Discourse and Social Psychology&quot; with Margaret Wetherell, which is a foundational text in the development of a discourse analytic approach to social psychology, now known as discursive psychology. The book introduced new ways to conceptualize fundamental social psychological concepts such as attitudes, categories, social representations, and rules. It has been cited over three thousand times in more than a hundred different journals. One of its key contributions was the development of the analytic notion of &#x27;interpretative repertoires,&#x27; adapted from Gilbert and Mulkay&#x27;s work on scientific discourse, and its application to social psychological topics. A joint grant led by Margaret Wetherell resulted in the 1992 volume &quot;Mapping the Language of Racism&quot;, which examined how racism is expressed and legitimized in conversations, newspaper articles, and parliamentary debates.

In the early 1990s, Potter and Derek Edwards authored &quot;Discursive Psychology&quot;, establishing a specific style of work now prevalent in social science journals. This approach challenged core notions in cognitive psychology, particularly memory and attribution, by demonstrating that cognitive processes and events are embedded in and part of language use. For example, they reanalyzed Ulric Neisser&#x27;s work on the Watergate testimony, showing how John Dean&#x27;s accounts of his memory were used by counsel in building the case against Richard Nixon. This work differed from earlier discourse analytic approaches by using records of natural interaction rather than open-ended interviews and focusing on sequential interaction instead of identifying interpretative repertoires.

In 1996, Potter published &quot;Representing Reality&quot;, which built on his engagement with the sociology of scientific knowledge and other approaches to factuality. The book provided an overview, extension, and critique of social constructionism in the social sciences, developing a discursive version of constructionism in contrast to the more familiar social constructionism of thinkers such as Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann.

Potter co-edited &quot;Conversation and Cognition&quot; with Hedwig te Molder, a collection that brought together conversation analysts, ethnomethodologists, and discursive psychologists, including Geoff Coulter, John Heritage, Anita Pomerantz, and Robert Hopper, to address fundamental issues at the intersection of cognition and interaction.

In 2007, Potter edited a three-volume set of books that compiled a wide range of studies in discursive psychology.

==Recent Work==

Much of Jonathan Potter&#x27;s recent work has been in collaboration with Alexa Hepburn. They have developed a research program using material collected from the UK National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children&#x27;s child protection helpline. This research combines a theoretical interest in how concepts such as emotion and joint understanding are conceptualized in social psychological research with a focus on applied topics, such as advice resistance and its management.

Their paper on the problems and prospects of using qualitative interviews in psychology, published in &quot;Qualitative Research in Psychology&quot;, sparked a debate with Jonathan Smith, Wendy Hollway, and Elliot Mishler, and has been widely cited. This discourse stimulated further discussion in &quot;Qualitative Research&quot; with Chris Griffin and Karen Henwood.

Potter and Hepburn&#x27;s new research focuses on studying video records of mealtime interactions in families with young children. This work examines actions such as directives, requests, and threats, with a broader concern about how interaction analysis can contribute to the study of obesity.

In a 2010 paper in the British Journal of Social Psychology, Potter summarized and continued the debate over the status of discursive psychology concerning both traditional social psychology and alternative styles of critical work.

<doc id="989126" wikidata="Q919944" url="?curid=989126" title="Urdu literature">
<text>Urdu literature (, ) comprises the literary works, written in the Urdu language. While it tends to be dominated by poetry, especially the verse forms of the &quot;ghazal&quot; () and &quot;nazm&quot; (), it has expanded into other styles of writing, including that of the short story, or &quot;afsana&quot; (). Urdu literature is popular mostly in Pakistan, where Urdu is the national language, and in India, where it is an Eighth Schedule language.

==Origin==
Urdu developed during the 12th to 13th centuries, although the name &quot;Urdu&quot; did not exist at the time for the language. Amir Khusrau, who lived in the thirteenth century, wrote and gave shape to the Rekhta dialect (the Persianized combination of Hindavi), which was the early form of Modern Standard Urdu. He was thus called, the &quot;father of Urdu literature&quot;. The continuing traditions of Islam and patronizations of foreign culture centuries earlier by Muslim rulers, usually of Turkic or Afghan descent, marked their influence on the Urdu language given that both cultural heritages were strongly present throughout Urdu territory. The Urdu language, with a vocabulary almost evenly split between Sanskrit-derived Prakrit and Arabo-Persian words, was a reflection of this cultural amalgamation.

==Religious period (1350–1590)==
Literary composition in Urdu first started in the Deccan in the 14th century. An early form of Urdu was first introduced in the Deccan by the soldiers of Alauddin Khalji who raided the Deccan from 1294 to 1311. In 1326, Muhammad bin Tughluq shifted his capital from Delhi to the Deccan and in 1347 Zafar Khan, his governor in the Deccan, declared independence establishing the Bahmani Sultanate and took the title of Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah. The Bahmani sultans cultivated the use of Urdu in the kingdom as opposed to Persian which was the court language of the Delhi Sultanate. This dialect, which up to 1375 had no difference with Delhi Urdu, was influenced by local languages like Gujarati and Marathi came to be known as Dakhini. The works composed during this period are mostly Dakhini prose and poetry on religious themes.

Important writers of this period include Bande Nawaz whose &quot;Miraj ul Asiquin&quot;, a Sufi tract is one of the earliest Urdu prose. Other important writers included Shah Miranji and his son Shah Buran.

==Urdu in the Deccan (1590–1730)==
===Qutub Shahi poets (1590–1687)===
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golkonda and founder of the city of Hyderabad, was a royal poet and prolific writer in Persian and Dakhini. Other poets included Wajhi and Gavvasi. In 1655, Ibn e Nishati wrote &quot;Phul ban&quot;, a romance in 1300 lines. &quot;Qissa o bairam e Gul andman&quot; written by Tab’i is an important work of the period. Written in 1670, it is nearly 2700 lines long.

===Adil Shahi poets (1590–1688)===
Ibrahim Adil Shah II was another royal poet who was also a patron of art and literature. His Kitab-e-Navras (Book of Nine Rasas) in Dakhani is a collection of 59 poems and 17 couplets. Other important poets included Rustami, Nusrati, and Mirza.

===Urdu in Deccan under Mughal Rule (1687–1730)===
The most important Urdu writer of this period was Wali Mohammed Wali.

==18th century==
===First Urdu period in Delhi (1730–1830)===

In the 18th century, the three most important forms of Urdu poetry were &quot;ghazal&quot;, the &quot;qasida,&quot; and the &quot;masnavi&quot;. Shaikh Zahuruddin Hatim was an important poet in Delhi during this period. His major works include two volumes of poetry, &quot;Diwan&quot; and &quot;Diwanzada&quot;. Urdu poetry was dominated by Mazhar, Sauda, Mir, and Dard, who later came to be known as “the Four Pillars of Urdu Poetry”. Another major figure was Mir Hasan, known for his masnavis, the most famous being &quot;Sihar-ul-Bayan,&quot; often referred to as &quot;Masnavi e Mir Hasan&quot;.

Other important poets of this period include Mas&#x27;hafi, Insha and Nazeer.

==19th century==
===Poetry===

====Urdu poetry in Lucknow====
During the nineteenth century, the centre of Urdu literature shifted from Delhi as most literary men migrated to other parts of India like Hyderabad, Patna, and Lucknow. The Lucknow court emerged as the centre of Urdu poetry as it received poets from Delhi with much enthusiasm. Chief among these poets were Khaliq, Zamir, Aatish, and Nasikh. Other poets included Anis and Dabir.

====Second Urdu period in Delhi====
The second quarter of the nineteenth century saw the revival of Urdu poetry in Delhi in the Mughal court. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor, was himself a poet and a patron of poetry. Chief poets who flourished under his patronage includes Zauq, Ghalib, Azurda, and Momin.

Some of Momin&#x27;s pupils in poetry such as Shefta and Mir Hussain Taskin became distinguished poets themselves.

==== New movement ====
The fall of the Mughal empire and kingdom of Awadh after the Rebellion of 1857 and the contact with English language started a new movement in Urdu literature. The flag bearers of this new movement were Syed Ahmad Khan, Muhammad Husain Azad, and Altaf Hussain Hali. This period saw the rise of prose, criticism, and drama in Urdu literature. Writers and poets began to explore new subjects and themes and experiment with new forms.

Altaf Hussain Hali was a prolific poet who left a vast amount of work behind. His major poetic works include &quot;Masnavis&quot;, &quot;Musaddas e Hali&quot;, &quot;Shikwa e Hind,&quot; and &quot;Qasida e Ghyasia&quot;. He also wrote &quot;marsias&quot; or elegies on the deaths of Ghalib, Hakim Mahmud Khan, and Sir Syed.

Suroor Jahanabadi was another exponent of the new movement in Urdu poetry. He wrote patriotic poems like &quot;Khak-i-Watan&quot; (The Dust of the Motherland), &quot;Urus-i-Hubbi-Watan&quot; (The Bride of the Love of the Country), and &quot;Madar-i-Hind&quot; (Mother India). His historical and religious poems include &quot;Padmani&quot;, &quot;Padmani-ki-Chita&quot; (Funeral Pyre of Padmani), and &quot;Sitaji-ki-Giria-o-Zari&quot; (The Laments of Sita).

===Prose===
Ghalib, better known for his poetry, also wrote a considerable amount of Urdu prose during his lifetime which includes his collection of letters and three short pamphlets entitled &quot;Lataif-i-Ghalib&quot;, &quot;Tegh-i-Tez,&quot; and &quot;Nama-i-Ghalib&quot;. His letters, autobiographical in nature, were collected and published in two volumes as &quot;Urdu-i-Mualla&quot; (the Royal Urdu) and &quot;Ud-i-Hindi&quot; (Fragrant Stick of India).

====Fort William College writers====
Until the nineteenth century, Persian was the official language of the court and culture and all correspondence was carried out in Persian. The development of Urdu prose for practical purposes can be traced back to the establishment of the Fort William College in Calcutta in 1800 which was founded to instruct British officers of the East India Company in Indian vernacular languages. John Gilchrist, the head of the college, was author of many Hindustani works such as &quot;Oriental Linguist, an Introduction to the Language of Hindustani&quot; and &quot;Hindustani Grammar&quot;. He gathered a group of Indian scholars at the college who went on to write books for the use of fresh officers and also created a standard prose for Urdu and Hindi. The chief among these scholars were Mir Amman Dehelvi, Mir Sher Ali Jaafri, Mir Bahadur Ali Husaini, Sayid Haidar Bakhsh, Kazim Ali Jawan, Nihalchand, Hafizuddin Ahmad, Ikram Ali Khan, Lallujilal, Beni Narayan, and Mirza Ali Lutf.

====Aligarh movement====

Syed Ahmed Khan, the leading figure of the Aligarh Movement, was also a voracious writer and journalist who wrote various books from theological to historical subjects. His major theological work, &quot;Al-Khutbat al-Ahmadiya fi&#x27;l Arab wa&#x27;I Sirat al-Muhammadiya&quot; (A Series of Essays on the Life of Muhammad and Subjects Subsidiary Therein), was published in 1876. He made significant contributions to Urdu journalism through his journals and periodicals, &quot;Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq&quot; and the &quot;Aligarh Institute Gazette&quot;.

The Aligarh movement produced a band of literary enthusiasts who had a far-reaching influence on Urdu literature. The chief among them were Shibli Nomani and Zakaullah Dehlvi who wrote on history, Chiragh Ali, Mohsin-ul-Mulk, and Waqar-ul-Mulk who wrote on literature.

Shibli Nomani is regarded as the father of modern history in Urdu. He wrote several biographical and historical books such as &quot;Sirat-un-Nabi&quot;, Sirat an-Nu&#x27;man, Al-Farooq, Al-Ma&#x27;mun, Al-Ghazali, (a biography of Imam Al-Ghazali), Mawlana Rumi (a biography of Mawlana Rumi), and Aurangzeb Alamgir Par Ek Nazar, a book on the life of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. He also wrote the first travelogue in Urdu, &quot;Safar Nama e Rome-o-Misr-o-Sham,&quot; which is an account of his travels abroad.

&quot;Tarikh-e-Hindustan&quot;, a fourteen-volume compilation of Indian history in Urdu written by Zakaullah Dehlvi, was a monumental achievement of this period.

Apart from poetry, Altaf Hussain Hali also made significant contributions to Urdu prose. &quot;Hayat-i Saadi&quot;, a biography of Saadi, &quot;Hayat-i Javed&quot;, a biography of Syed Ahmad Khan, and &quot;Yadgar-e-Ghalib&quot;, a biography and criticism on Ghalib, are some of his most important works in prose.

====Urdu novel====
In 1869, Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi published &quot;Mirat-ul-Uroos&quot;, the first original novel in Urdu. It served as Nazir&#x27;s form of conduct literature about marriage. He also wrote &quot;Binat-un-Nash&quot; and &quot;Toba tun Nasoh&quot; during this period, both of which are conduct books designed to instill moral virtues.

Muhammad Husain Azad laid the foundation of historical novels in Urdu with &quot;Qisas ul-hind&quot; and &quot;Darbār-e akbarī&quot;. His&quot; Aab-e hayat,&quot; which is a history of Urdu poetry from Wali to Ghalib, is regarded as the first chronological history of Urdu poetry.

Ratan Nath Dhar Sarshar introduced proper fiction and touch of realism in Urdu novels with his serialised novel &quot;Fasana-e-Azad&quot; which was influenced by Don Quixote. His other notable novels are &quot;Sair-i-Kohsar&quot; and &quot;Jam-i-Sarshar&quot;. He also wrote articles and short stories for the humorous journal, Awadh Punch.

Influenced by the historical romances of Walter Scott, Abdul Halim Sharar introduced historical elements in his own works such as &quot;Malikul Azia Vārjina&quot;.

Mirza Hadi Ruswa was a poet and writer, best remembered for his Umrao Jaan Ada, published at the end of the nineteenth century.

===Drama===
Drama in Urdu was introduced in the 19th century through the production of &quot;Inder Sabha&quot; written by Agha Hasan Amanat, and first staged in 1853. It was a musical comedy with a thin plot line and was modelled after the European opera.

==20th century==
===Prose===
====Age of Premchand====
Premchand emerged on the literary scene in the early 1890s and soon became probably the most significant writer and novelist in the history of Urdu literature. He also wrote in Hindi. He wrote on the themes of religious and social reforms in &quot;Isare-e-Muabid&quot; and &quot;Hum Khurma-O Hum Swab&quot;, on the predicament of a prostitute in &quot;Bazaar-e-Husn&quot;, the problems of the farmers in &quot;Gosha-e Aafiat,&quot; and the problems of the middle class and women in &quot;Nirmala&quot;. Premchand was also the first writer to introduce European-style short stories in Urdu. His first collection of short stories, &quot;Soz-e- Watan&quot;, published in 1907, was banned by the British government.

Other major writers during this period include Sudarshan, Mohammad Mehdi Taskeen, Qazi Abdul Gaffar, Majnun Gorakhpuri, Niaz Fatehpuri, Krishan Prasad Kaul, and L.M. Ahmed.

====Progressive Writers’ Movement====
In the 1930s, the short story became the leading prose genre in Urdu due to the influx of western influences especially the English, French, and Russian. The publication of &quot;Angarey&quot;, a short story collection by Sajjad Zaheer, Rashid Jahan, Mahmud-uz-Zafar, and Ahmed Ali in 1932 marked the beginning of the Progressive Writers&#x27; Movement that went on to substantially influence the content of Urdu literature for the next two decades.

Ismat Chughtai was an important progressive novelist and short story writer who wrote extensively on femininity. Her major works include the collection of short stories &quot;Kaliyan&quot; and &quot;Chotein&quot;. She is best remembered for her short story &quot;Lihaaf&quot; published in 1942.

Krishan Chander realistically portrayed life in his novel and stories such as &quot;Ek Gadhe ki Sargushisht&quot;, &quot;Shikast&quot;, &quot;Zindagi ke Mor Par&quot;, &quot;Hum Waishi Hain&quot;, &quot;Anna Datta&quot;, &quot;Kalu Bhangi&quot;, and &quot;Paude&quot;.

Another leading writer of this period was Saadat Hasan Manto who wrote elaborately drawn stories like &quot;Khol do&quot;, &quot;Toba Tek Singh&quot;, &quot;Mozelle&quot;, and &quot;Thanda Gosht&quot;.}

==Special contributors==
Amir Khusrau exercised great influence on the initial growth of not only Urdu literature, but the language itself (which only truly took shape as distinguished from both Persian and Old Hindi during the late 13th century). He is credited with the systematization of northern Indian classical music, including Hindustani music, and he wrote works both in Persian and Hindavi. While the couplets that come down from him are representative of a latter-Prakrit Hindi bereft of Arabo-Persian vocabulary, his influence on court viziers and writers must have been transcendental, for a century after his death Quli Qutub Shah was speaking a language that might be considered to be Urdu. Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah was a scholar in Persian and Arabic. He also wrote poetry in Telugu language, Persian language and Urdu language. His poetry has been compiled into Dewan or volume entitled &quot;Kulliyat-e-Quli Qutub Shah.&quot; Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah had the distinction of being the first Saheb-e-dewan Urdu poet and is credited with introducing a new sensibility into prevailing genres of Persian/Urdu poetry. It is said that the Urdu language acquired the status of a literary language due to his contributions. He died in the year 1611.

Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri is considered as the first researcher of Deccaniyat. some of the works of Allama Hakeem Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri are Salateen e Muabber 1929, Urdu-i-qadim 1930, Tareekh E Maleebaar, Mowarrikheen E Hind, Tahfat al Mujahidin 1931, Imadiya, Nizam Ut Tawareekh, Tareekh Zuban Urdu-Urdu-E-Qadeem, Tareekh Zuban Urdu Al Musamma Ba Urdu-E-Qadeem, Tareekh Zuban Urdu Yaani Urdu-E-Qadeem, Tarikh Vol III, Asaarul Karaam, Tarikh Shijrah Asifiya, Ahleyaar, Pracina malabar

== Dāstāngoi (epics) ==

Urdu literature was generally composed more of poetry than of prose. The prose component of Urdu literature was mainly restricted to the ancient form of epic stories called dāstān (). These long stories have complicated plots that deal with magical and otherwise fantastic creatures and events.

The genre originated in the Middle East and was disseminated by folk storytellers. It was assimilated by individual authors. Dastan plots are based both on folklore and classical literary subjects. Dastan was particularly popular in Urdu literature, typologically close to other narrative genres in Eastern literatures, such as Persian masnawi, Punjabi qissa, Sindhi waqayati bait, etc., and also reminiscent of the European novel. The oldest known Urdu dastans are &quot;Dastan-i-Amir Hamza&quot;, recorded in the early seventeenth century, and &quot;Bustan-i Khayal&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Imagination&quot; or &quot;The Garden of Khayal&quot;) by Mir Taqi Khayal (d. 1760). Most of the narrative dastans were recorded in the early nineteenth century, representing the inclusion of &#x27;wandering&#x27; motifs borrowed from the folklore of the Middle East, central Asia and northern India. These include &quot;Bagh-o-Bahar&quot; (&quot;The Garden and Spring&quot;) by Mir Amman, &quot;Mazhab-i-Ishq&quot; (&quot;The Religion of Love&quot;) by Nihalchand Lahori, &quot;Araish-i-Mahfil&quot; (&quot;The Adornment of the Assembly&quot;) by Hyderbakhsh Hyderi, and &quot;Gulzar-i-Chin&quot; (&quot;The Flower Bed of Chin&quot;) by Khalil Ali Khan Ashq.
Other famous Urdu dastans include &quot;Nau Tarz-i Murassa‘&quot; by Husain ‘Atā Khān Tahsīn, &quot;Nau Ā&#x27;īn-i Hindī&quot; (&quot;Qissa-i Malik Mahmūd Gīti-Afroz&quot;) by Mihr Chand Khatrī, &quot;Jazb-i ‘ishq&quot; by Shāh Husain Haqīqat, &quot;Nau Tarz-i Murassa‘&quot; by Muhammad Hādī (a.k.a. Mirzā Mughal Ghāfil), and &quot;Talism Hoshruba&quot; by Muhammad Husain Azad.

== Tazkiras (narrations) ==
Tazkiras (تذکیرہ) are compilations of literary memoirs that include verses and maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentaries on their styles. They are often a collection of names with a line or two of information about each poet, followed by specifics about his composition. Some of these tazkiras give biographical details, and a little idea of the style or poetical power is transmitted. Even the large anthologies do not systematically review an author&#x27;s work. Most of them have the names in alphabetical order, but one or two are ordered by historical chronology. The majority quote only lyrics, and the quotations are usually chosen randomly.

== Poetry ==

Urdu poetry (), reached its peak in the 19th century. The most well-developed form of poetry is the ghazal, known for its quality and quantity within the Urdu tradition.

===Sonnets===
Urdu poets influenced by English and other European-language poetry began writing sonnets in Urdu in the early 20th century. Azmatullah Khan (1887-1923) is believed to have introduced this format to Urdu poetry. Other renowned Urdu poets who wrote sonnets are Akhtar Junagarhi, Akhtar Sheerani, Noon Meem Rashid, Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi, Salaam Machhalishahari and Wazir Agha.

==Novels==
Initially, Urdu novels focused on urban social life, eventually widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, the partition of India had a great impact on the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration as can be seen in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratul Ain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the contemporary life and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of the current generation of Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in contemporary life, are &quot;Makaan&quot; by Paigham Afaqui, &quot;Do Gaz Zameen&quot; by Abdus Samad, and &quot;Pani&quot; by Ghazanfer. These works, especially &quot;Makaan&quot;, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of partition and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern-day realities and issues of life in India. &quot;Makaan&quot; had an impact on many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further impacted significant works such as &quot;Andhere Pag&quot; by Sarwat Khan, &quot;Numberdar Ka Neela&quot; by S M Ashraf and &quot;Fire Area&quot; by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui&#x27;s second major novel, &quot;Paleeta&quot;, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India&#x27;s independence. Bewildered by the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire.

===Famous novels===
*&quot;Mirat-ul-Uroos&quot; (&quot;The Bride&#x27;s Mirror&quot;; 1868–1869) by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed is regarded as the first novel in Urdu. Within twenty years of publication over 100,000 copies had been printed; and was also translated into Bengali, Braj, Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Gujarati. It has never been out of print in Urdu. In 1903 an English translation was published in London by G. E. Ward.
*&quot;Umrao Jaan Ada&quot; by Mirza Hadi Ruswa is considered the first Urdu novel by many critics.
*&quot;Binat-ul-Nash&quot; (&quot;The Daughters of the Bier&quot;, a name for the constellation Ursa Major) is another novel by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed. It was his 2nd novel after &quot;Mirat-tul-uroos&quot;. Like &quot;Mira-tul-Uroos&quot;, this novel is also on the education of women and their character building.
*&quot;Zindagi&quot; (&quot;Everything Happens in Life&quot;; 1933–1934) by Chaudhry Afzal Haq describes the ups and downs of life for developing moral values and guidance of young people. His entire work is full of the teaching of moral values.
*&quot;Taubat-un-Nasuh&quot; (&quot;Repentance of Nasuh&quot;; 1873–1874) by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed also focused on moral lessons for youth.
*&quot;Fasaana-e-Mubtalaa&quot; (1885) was another novel for developing moral values and guidance for youth.
*&quot;Jasoosi Dunya&quot; and &quot;Imran&quot; series by Ibn-e-Safi
*&quot;Aag Ka Darya&quot; by Quratulain Haider
*&quot;Aangan&quot; by Khadija Mastoor
*&quot;Udaas Naslain&quot; by Abdullah Hussain
*&quot;Jangloos&quot; by Shaukat Siddiqui
*&quot;Daira&quot; by Muhammad Asim Butt 
*&quot;Pir-e-Kamil&quot; by Umera Ahmad
*&quot;Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi&quot; by Rahman Abbas
*&quot;Ek Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani&quot; by Rahman Abbas
*&quot;Rohzin&quot; by Rahman Abbas

In the first decade of twenty first century, Rahman Abbas has emerged as most influential Urdu fiction writer. &quot;The Hindu&quot; writes about work of Rahman Abbas, &quot;With his uncanny ability to subvert what people believe, Rehman Abbas raises the art of story-telling to a new level.&quot;

===Short stories (afsanah nigari)===
Urdu literature has included the short story form for slightly more than one hundred years. During this period it has passed through some major phases including the early romantic period, progressive writings, modernist writings, and the current phase. Although a number of male and female writers wrote short stories during the first phase(including both romantic stories and social criticisms), the short story crystallized as a regular part of Urdu literature in the growth of the writings of Munshi Premchand. His notable short stories include &quot;Kafan&quot; and &quot;Poos Ki Raat&quot;. The Urdu short story gained momentum with the phenomenal publication of &quot;Angare&quot;, a collection of many writers towards the end of the life of Premchand. Writers like Ghulam Abbas, Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Krishan Chander and Ismat Chughtai, to name but a few, turned the short story into a major genre of Urdu literature.

The next generation of Urdu short story writers included Qurratulain Hyder, Qazi Abdul Sattar and Joginder Paul. The short story tradition continues with younger generation writers like Zahida Hina, Paigham Afaqui, Syed Muhammad Ashraf, Salam Bin Razzaq, Naeem Baig, Akhlaq Ahmed Khan, Moinuddin Jinabade, as well as notable women writers like Afra Bukhari and Wajida Tabassum.

Urdu short stories have dealt with a wide range of the dimensions of life, but the most famous stories concern the trauma of the partition of the sub-continent and the violence generated out of it. Towards the end of the last century, short stories became grounded in the complexity of daily life which can be seen in the unique collection of short stories in Paigham Afaqui&#x27;s &quot;Mafia&quot;. An entirely different approach is seen in the collection of short stories &quot;T&#x27;abir&quot; by Moinuddin Jinabade and &quot;Taus Chaman Ka Maina&quot; by Nayyer Masood.

==Drama==

Urdu drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theater traditions have greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Among all the languages, Urdu (which was called Hindi &quot;meaning:Language of the Hind&quot; by some early writers), along with Gujarati, Marathi, and Bengali theatres have remained popular. Many Urdu dramas have also been made into films.

Classic playwrights include Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J. N. Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi and Jameel Shaidayi. Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi and Anwar are a few of the post-modern playwrights actively contributing to Urdu drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour in plays like &quot;Ghalib in New Delhi&quot;, &quot;Maulana Azad&quot; and &quot;Big B&quot;.

Danish Iqbal&#x27;s &quot;Dara Shikoh&quot;, directed by M S Sathyu, is considered a modern classic for its use of newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are &quot;Sahir&quot;, on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet; &quot;Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam&quot;, a Celebration of the Faiz&#x27;s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals; and &quot;Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan&quot;, another play inspired from Faiz&#x27;s letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including &quot;Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa&quot; and &quot;Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon&quot;.

Shahid&#x27;s &quot;Three B&quot; is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups including &#x27;Natwa&#x27;. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu Theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of the previous generation, Sayeed, Shahid, Iqbal, and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but rather their work is a product of a vigorous performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu. His play &quot;Aur Kitne Jalyanwala Baugh??&quot; won several awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for the stage and not for libraries.

According to The Dawn, the Progressive Writers Movement in Urdu literature was the strongest movement after Sir Syed&#x27;s education movement.

===Modernism===
The modernist movement started in Urdu literature around 1960. This movement laid more stress on symbolic and other indirect expressions as opposed to direct and clear expressions. The most well-known names in this movement included Shamsur Rehman Farooqui and Gopichand Narang and the poets Noon Meem Rashid and Meeraji. Apart from them, a number of other poets like Zafer Iqbal, Nasir Kazmi, Bashir Bader and Shahryar are related to this movement.

===Halqa e Arbab e Zauq===
Halqa e Arbab e Zauq was a literary movement begun in Lahore, British Raj in 1939. Early members included poets Noon Meem Rashid, Zia Jallandhari, Muhtar Siddiqui, Hafeez Hoshiarpuri and Meeraji, brought to the meeting by his friend, Qayyum Nazar, an active member of the group. The Halqa was the second modern literary movement in Urdu poetry in the 20th century, founded just a couple of years after the leftist Progressive Writers&#x27; Movement, and is considered to be the most influential group on modern poetry in the Urdu Language.

===Post-modernism===
Post-modernism was introduced to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also attached to this approach to criticism. Post-modernism does not claim to be a movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature in the light of its content—mostly examining features like feminism, Dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends.

===Independent writers===
By the end of the 1980s the atmosphere in Urdu literature became very depressing. The progressive movement was almost dead and the modernist movement had started running out of ideas. But this was also the time for an upsurge of new creative forces rooted in the new life that was metamorphosing the socio-economic and political climate in the sub-continent. It was under this climate that a new era of fiction started with the publication of Paigham Afaqui&#x27;s novel &quot;Makaan&quot;. Afaqui and other writers refused to be identified by any movement and displayed complete independence in using personally developed styles and techniques for writing novels and explored their own philosophy and vision of life. It was a serious departure from the theme of partition which dominated writers like Qurtul Ain haider and Abdullah Hussain and the theme of existentialism which was the benchmark of modernism. Writers like Ghazanfer and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have further widened the horizons of new themes and concerns.

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd is a new and somewhat rare genre in the history of Urdu literature. The first play of the genre was written and published by the Pakistan research-writer, poet, lawyer and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi in December 2008 under the title &quot;Mazaron Ke Phool&quot; (i.e. &quot;Graveyard Flowers&quot;).

==Classical literature vs. popular literature==
There is an old distinction of classical literature () and popular literature () in Urdu language, where the popular writers of digests/magazines are discriminated somewhat as a &quot;lower caste&quot;. While the literary critics are still reluctant to acknowledge the popular writers, nevertheless, the contributions of Ibn-e-Safi and other writers like Mohiuddin Nawab, Ilyas Sitapuri, MA Rahat, Ishtiaq Ahmed, and many others, to Urdu literature cannot be ignored.

<text>Discourse analysis (DA), or discourse studies, is an approach to the analysis of written, spoken, or sign language, including any significant semiotic event.

The objects of discourse analysis (discourse, writing, conversation, communicative event) are variously defined in terms of coherent sequences of sentences, propositions, speech, or turns-at-talk. Contrary to much of traditional linguistics, discourse analysts not only study language use &#x27;beyond the sentence boundary&#x27; but also prefer to analyze &#x27;naturally occurring&#x27; language use, not invented examples. Text linguistics is a closely related field. The essential difference between discourse analysis and text linguistics is that discourse analysis aims at revealing socio-psychological characteristics of a person/persons rather than text structure.

Discourse analysis has been taken up in a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics, education, sociology, anthropology, social work, cognitive psychology, social psychology, area studies, cultural studies, international relations, human geography, environmental science, communication studies, biblical studies, public relations, argumentation studies, and translation studies, each of which is subject to its own assumptions, dimensions of analysis, and methodologies.

==History==
===Early use of the term===

There is ongoing discussion about whether Austria-born Leo Spitzer&#x27;s &quot;Stilstudien&quot; (&quot;Style Studies&quot;) of 1928 is the earliest example of &quot;discourse analysis&quot; (DA). Michel Foucault translated it into French. However, the term first came into general use following the publication of a series of papers by Zellig Harris from 1952 reporting on work from which he developed transformational grammar in the late 1930s. Formally equivalent relations among the sentences of a coherent discourse are made explicit by using sentence transformations to put the text in a canonical form. Words and sentences with equivalent information then appear in the same column of an array.

This work progressed over the next four decades (see references) into a science of sublanguage analysis (Kittredge &amp; Lehrberger 1982), culminating in a demonstration of the informational structures in texts of a sublanguage of science, that of immunology (Harris et al. 1989), and a fully articulated theory of linguistic informational content (Harris 1991). During this time, however, most linguists ignored such developments in favor of a succession of elaborate theories of sentence-level syntax and semantics.

In January 1953, a linguist working for the American Bible Society, James A. Lauriault (&quot;alt.&quot; Loriot), needed to find answers to some fundamental errors in translating Quechua, in the Cuzco area of Peru. Following Harris&#x27;s 1952 publications, he worked over the meaning and placement of each word in a collection of Quechua legends with a native speaker of Quechua and was able to formulate discourse rules that transcended the simple sentence structure. He then applied the process to Shipibo, another language of Eastern Peru. He taught the theory at the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Norman, Oklahoma, in the summers of 1956 and 1957 and entered the University of Pennsylvania to study with Harris in the interim year. He tried to publish a paper,&quot;Shipibo Paragraph Structure&quot;, but it was delayed until 1970 (Loriot &amp; Hollenbach 1970). In the meantime, Kenneth Lee Pike, a professor at the University of Michigan, taught the theory, and one of his students, Robert E. Longacre, developed it in his writings. Harris&#x27;s methodology disclosing the correlation of form with meaning was developed into a system for the computer-aided analysis of natural language by a team led by Naomi Sager at NYU, which has been applied to a number of sublanguage domains, most notably to medical informatics. The software for the Medical Language Processor is publicly available on SourceForge.

===In the humanities===
In the late 1960s and 1970s, and without reference to this prior work, a variety of other approaches to a new cross-discipline of DA began to develop in most of the humanities and social sciences concurrently with, and related to, other disciplines. These include semiotics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and pragmatics. Many of these approaches, especially those influenced by the social sciences, favor a more dynamic study of oral talk-in-interaction. An example is &quot;conversational analysis&quot; (CA), which was influenced by the sociologist Harold Garfinkel, the founder of ethnomethodology.

==Perspectives==
The following are some of the specific theoretical perspectives and analytical approaches used in linguistic discourse analysis:

*Applied linguistics, an interdisciplinary perspective on linguistic analysis
* Cognitive neuroscience of discourse comprehension
*Cognitive psychology, studying the production and comprehension of discourse.
*Conversation analysis
*Critical discourse analysis
*Discursive psychology
*Emergent grammar
*Ethnography of communication
*Functional grammar
*Interactional sociolinguistics
*Mediated stylistics
*Pragmatics
*Response based therapy (counselling)
*Rhetoric
*Stylistics (linguistics)
*Sublanguage analysis
*Tagmemics
*Text linguistics
*Variation analysis

Although these approaches emphasize different aspects of language use, they all view language as social interaction and are concerned with the social contexts in which discourse is embedded.

Often a distinction is made between &#x27;local&#x27; structures of discourse (such as relations among sentences, propositions, and turns) and &#x27;global&#x27; structures, such as overall topics and the schematic organization of discourses and conversations. For instance, many types of discourse begin with some kind of global &#x27;summary&#x27;, in titles, headlines, leads, abstracts, and so on.

==Topics of interest==
Topics of discourse analysis include:
* The various levels or dimensions of discourse, such as sounds (intonation, etc.), gestures, syntax, the lexicon, style, rhetoric, meanings, speech acts, moves, strategies, turns, and other aspects of interaction
*Genres of discourse (various types of discourse in politics, the media, education, science, business, etc.)
*The relations between discourse and the emergence of syntactic structure
*The relations between text (discourse) and context
*The relations between discourse and power
*The relations between discourse and interaction
*The relations between discourse and cognition and memory
*Lexical density

===Political discourse===

Political discourse is the text and talk of professional politicians or political institutions, such as presidents and prime ministers and other members of government, parliament or political parties, both at the local, national and international levels, includes both the speaker and the audience.

Political discourse analysis is a field of discourse analysis which focuses on discourse in political forums (such as debates, speeches, and hearings) as the phenomenon of interest. Policy analysis requires discourse analysis to be effective from the post-positivist perspective.

Political discourse is the formal exchange of reasoned views as to which of several alternative courses of action should be taken to solve a societal problem.

=== Corporate discourse ===
Corporate discourse can be broadly defined as the language used by corporations. It encompasses a set of messages that a corporation sends out to the world (the general public, the customers and other corporations) and the messages it uses to communicate within its own structures (the employees and other stakeholders).

<text>Annual or Anoual (Berber language: Anwal) is a small town in northeastern Morocco about 60 km west of Nador. There, during the Rif War or War of Melilla, on July 22, 1921, the Spanish army suffered a grave military defeat against the Rifian Berber army, known as the Battle of Annual.

<doc id="989141" wikidata="Q2333298" url="?curid=989141" title="Madvillainy">
<text>Madvillainy is the only studio album by American hip-hop duo Madvillain, consisting of British-American rapper MF Doom and American record producer Madlib. It was released on March 23, 2004, on Stones Throw Records.

The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Madlib created most of the instrumentals during a trip to Brazil in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a turntable, and a tape deck. Fourteen months before the album was released, an unfinished demo version was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they had released other solo projects.

While &quot;Madvillainy&quot; achieved only moderate commercial success, it became one of the best-selling Stones Throw albums. It peaked at number 179 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and attracted attention from media outlets not usually covering hip-hop music, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;Madvillainy&quot; received widespread critical acclaim for Madlib&#x27;s production and MF Doom&#x27;s lyricism, and is regarded as Doom&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. It has since been widely regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time in general, being ranked in various publications&#x27; lists of all-time greatest albums, including at 411 on &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at 365 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and at 18 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.

== Background ==
In 1997, after the death of his brother DJ Subroc and the rejection of KMD&#x27;s album &quot;Black Bastards&quot; by Elektra Records four years previously, rapper Daniel Dumile (formerly known as Zev Love X) returned to music as the masked rapper MF Doom. In 1999, Doom released his debut solo album &quot;&quot; on Fondle &#x27;Em Records. According to Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, the album &quot;has attained mythic status; its legend has grown in proportion to its relative unavailability&quot;. Soon after release of the album, in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Madlib stated that he wanted to collaborate with two artists: J Dilla and Doom.

In 2001, after Fondle &#x27;Em closed, Doom disappeared. During that time, he lived between Long Island, New York, and Kennesaw, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. Coincidentally, Eothen &quot;Egon&quot; Alapatt, who was the manager of Madlib&#x27;s label Stones Throw Records, had a friend in Kennesaw. He asked the friend to give Doom (who did not know about Madlib and Stones Throw at the time) some instrumentals from Madlib. Three weeks later, the friend called back, telling him that Doom loved the instrumentals and wanted to work with Madlib. Soon, one of Doom&#x27;s &quot;quasi-managers&quot; made an offer, asking for plane tickets to Los Angeles and $1,500. Despite the fact that the label didn&#x27;t have enough money after buying the tickets, they immediately agreed. According to Egon, soon after arrival, the manager went to him demanding money, while Doom visited Madlib:

Egon&#x27;s plan was successful, and Doom and Madlib began working together. Soon after, Stones Throw Records managed to collect the money necessary to pay Doom and a contract to the label was signed, which was written on a paper plate.

==Recording==
Doom and Madlib started working on &quot;Madvillainy&quot; in 2002. Madlib created one hundred beats in a matter of weeks, some of which were used on &quot;Madvillainy&quot;, some were used on his collaboration album with J Dilla &quot;Champion Sound&quot;, while others were used for M.E.D.&#x27;s and Dudley Perkins&#x27; albums. Even though Stones Throw booked Doom a hotel room, he spent most of the time in Madlib&#x27;s studio, based in an old bomb shelter in Mount Washington, Los Angeles. When the duo was not working on the album, they were spending free time together, drinking beer, eating Thai food, smoking marijuana, and taking psychedelic mushrooms. &quot;Figaro&quot; and &quot;Meat Grinder&quot; were among the songs recorded during this time.

In November 2002, Madlib went to Brazil to participate in a Red Bull Music Academy lecture, where he debuted the first music from the album by playing an unfinished version of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Blunted&quot;. Madlib also went crate digging during his time in Brazil, searching for obscure vinyl records he could sample later, with fellow producers Cut Chemist, DJ Babu, and J.Rocc. According to Madlib himself, he bought multiple crates full of vinyl records, two of which he later lost. He used some of these records to produce beats for &quot;Madvillainy&quot;. Most of the album, including beats for &quot;Strange Ways&quot;, &quot;Raid&quot;, and &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;, was produced in his hotel room in São Paulo, using a portable turntable, a cassette deck, and a Boss SP-303 sampler. While Madlib was working on the album in Brazil, the unfinished demo was stolen and leaked on the internet, 14 months before its official release. Jeff Jank, Stones Throw&#x27;s art director, remembers the leak in the interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;:

Doom and Madlib decided to work on different projects. Madlib released &quot;Champion Sound&quot; with J Dilla, while Doom released two solo albums: &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, as King Geedorah, and &quot;Vaudeville Villain&quot;, as Viktor Vaughn. Nevertheless, after the release of these albums, they decided to return to &quot;Madvillainy&quot;. For the final version of the album, Doom altered his voice, described by Peanut Butter Wolf as going from &quot;really hyper, more enthusiastic&quot; to &quot;a more mellow, relaxed, confident, less abrasive&quot;, and changed some lyrics to coincide with this change. Madlib was also asked by the label to change some instrumentals, but told them that he forgot the samples he used, in order to allow for them to remain on the album. Additionally, the label also requested the duo make a proper ending for the album, forcing them to rent a studio for the recording of &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;. The beat used, however, was produced in Brazil.

===Production===

&quot;Madvillainy&quot; was produced almost entirely by Madlib, except the first track, which he produced in collaboration with Doom. On the album, Madlib incorporates his distinctive production style, based on using samples, mostly obscure, from albums recorded in different countries. Aside from sampling records by American artists, namely from jazz and soul, Madlib also used Indian (for example, &quot;Shadows of Tomorrow&quot; samples &quot;Hindu Hoon Main Na Musalman Hoon&quot; by R. D. Burman) and Brazilian records (&quot;Curls&quot; samples &quot;Airport Love Theme&quot; by Waldir Calmon) for &quot;Madvillainy&quot;. In regards to Madlib&#x27;s production on the album, he stated in an interview:

I did most of the Madvillain album in Brazil. Cuts like &quot;Raid&quot; I did in my hotel room in Brazil on a portable turntable, my 303, and a little tape deck. I recorded it on tape, came back here, put it on CD, and Doom made a song out of it.

The album consists of 22 songs, most of which are under 3 minutes and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, &quot;sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field [marijuana]-toting skits&quot;. He also noted that some instrumentals on the album &quot;[seem] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; compared the album to a buffet, where &quot;Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as they have them, giving them as much attention as they need, and moving on to the next thing&quot;. Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised Madlib&#x27;s instrumentals and said that they &quot;make the album a sonic feast&quot;.

===Lyrics===
Doom&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Madvillainy&quot; are free-associative. According to &quot;Stereogum&quot;, the album &quot;is about using sound to craft semi-indecipherable vignettes that are situated somewhere between the real and the mythical&quot;. Despite originally featuring a more enthusiastic, excited delivery, the leak prompted Doom to go with a slower and more relaxed flow on the final version of the album. This move has been praised by various publications, including &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, which said that it was &quot;ultimately better-suited&quot; than the original.

Throughout the album, Doom uses a number of literary devices, including multisyllabic rhymes, internal rhymes, alliteration, assonance, and holorimes. Music critics also noted extensive use of wordplay and double entendres. &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;You can spend hours poring over the lyric sheet and attempting to grok Doom&#x27;s infinitely dense verbiage. If language is arbitrary, then many of Doom&#x27;s verses exploit the essence of words stripped of meaning, random conglomerations of syllables assembled in an order that only makes sense from a rhythmical standpoint&quot;, the critic added. &quot;The Observer&quot; stated that &quot;the densely telegraphic lyrics almost always reward closer inspection&quot; and that Doom&#x27;s &quot;rhymes miss beats, drop into the middle of the next line, work their way through whole verses&quot; allowing for a smooth listen.

==Artwork==
The album cover art was created by Stones Throw&#x27;s art director Jeff Jank, based on a grayscale photo of Doom in his metal mask. In an interview with &quot;Ego Trip&quot;, Jank said:

The photo was created by photographer Eric Coleman at Stones Throw&#x27;s house in Los Angeles, and edited by Jank. While working on the &quot;Madvillainy&quot; album cover, Jank drew inspiration from King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; artwork. However, following its completion, he noticed the artwork eerily resembled Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot; artwork. Despite this, Jank stuck with the original artwork, labeling it as the &quot;rap version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;&quot;. A small orange square was added to the final version of &quot;Madvillainy&quot;, due to Jank&#x27;s thinking that the artwork &quot;needed something distinctive&quot;, comparing it to the orange &quot;O&quot; on the &quot;Madonna&quot; cover.

==Release and promotion==
Two singles from &quot;Madvillainy&quot; were released before the album release: &quot;Money Folder&quot; bundled with &quot;America&#x27;s Most Blunted&quot;, and &quot;All Caps&quot; bundled with &quot;Curls&quot;. The first single peaked at number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;Madvillainy&quot; was released on March 23, 2004. Despite Stones Throw Records being a relatively small label, the album achieved moderate commercial success, which was big for the label. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;after two years of hectoring Stones Throw for making unsalable records, distributor EMI couldn&#x27;t keep &quot;Madvillainy&quot; in stock.&quot; The album peaked at number 179 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold approximately 150,000 copies, making it one of the label&#x27;s best-selling albums. Its success allowed Stones Throw to open an office in Highland Park, Los Angeles.

Four official videos were created for the album upon its initial release: &quot;All Caps&quot; (directed by James Reitano), &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Accordion&quot; (both directed by Andrew Gura), and &quot;Shadows of Tomorrow&quot; (directed by System D-128). &quot;All Caps&quot; and &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; appear on the DVD &quot;Stones Throw 101&quot; along with a hidden easter egg video for &quot;Shadows Of Tomorrow&quot; as a special bonus feature. An impromptu video for &quot;Accordion&quot; was filmed in 2004 but was not released until 2008&#x27;s &quot;In Living the True Gods&quot; DVD. In November 2024, Stones Throw re-released &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Accordion,&quot; to their YouTube channel, both remastered by director Andrew Gura from the original files to 4K resolution.

An instrumental version of the album was released in 2004 only in vinyl format and digitally through various online stores, with the tracks &quot;The Illest Villains&quot;, &quot;Bistro&quot;, &quot;Sickfit&quot;, &quot;Do Not Fire!&quot;, and &quot;Supervillain Theme&quot; being omitted. It was re-released in 2012 on vinyl with picture sleeve.

In 2014, in honor of the 10th anniversary of &quot;Madvillainy&quot;, Stones Throw released a special edition of the album on vinyl. The album re-entered &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, peaking at number 117, higher than it did originally. The same year &quot;Madvillainy&quot; was also released on Compact Cassettes, as part of the Cassette Store Day.

===Remixes===
Several remixes of the album were released. Two remix EPs of &quot;Madvillainy&quot; were released on Stones Throw in 2005. The remixes were done by Four Tet and Koushik. &quot;Madvillainy 2: The Madlib Remix&quot; was released on Stones Throw in 2008, containing a complete remix of the album by Madlib as a part of a Madvillain box set. According to &quot;Stereogum&quot;, it was Madlib&#x27;s &quot;attempt to get Doom excited enough to work on a true follow-up&quot;, recorded after he got tired of waiting for Doom to record the official sequel.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Madvillainy&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim from music critics and became one of the most critically acclaimed projects of both artists. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 93, based on 20 reviews; it was the year&#x27;s best-reviewed rap album and third highest reviewed album overall, according to the website. It also was the second most acclaimed rap album at the time of its release, behind Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Stankonia&quot;. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic wrote that album&#x27;s strength &quot;lies in its mix between seemingly obtuse beats, samples, MCing, and some straight-up hip-hop bumping&quot; and that &quot;MF Doom&#x27;s unpredictable lyrical style fits quite nicely within Madlib&#x27;s unconventional beat orchestrations&quot;. Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;indie rap blowing session by two guys near the top of their game&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; praised &quot;Madvillainy&quot; as &quot;all invention and no indulgence&quot;, while &quot;HipHopDX&quot; dubbed it an &quot;experimental, eclectic, raw, spontaneous&quot; classic. &quot;Mojo&quot; praised the album, calling it &quot;a symphony of such densely constructed chaos&quot; and noting that &quot;&quot;Madvillainy&quot;&#x27;s very opacity is part of its brilliance&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; called &quot;Madvillainy&quot; &quot;inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of carefully considered yet immediate hip-hop, forward-thinking but always close to its roots&quot;, noting that &quot;the samples are smart and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as MF Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; called Madlib &quot;the most innovative beatsman since Prince Paul&quot;, who created &quot;an oddball, cartoon-heavy backdrop for MF Doom&#x27;s mellifluous wordplay&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Madlib&#x27;s tracks as, &quot;fuzzy and crackling with dust&quot;, and praised MF Doom, whose flow was commended as &quot;a particularly elegant slur, with syllables spreading over a beat, not crisply adhering to it&quot;. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a chameleonic masterpiece that alone validates the artistry of sampler culture&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, praised the album as &quot;a glorious phantasmagoria of flow&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot;″s Jody Rosen called it a &quot;torrid album that marries old-school rap aesthetics to punk-rock concision.&quot;

&quot;Madvillainy&quot; also attracted positive reviews from several publications with infrequent coverage of hip-hop music. David Segal of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the album &quot;hysterical, [...] perplexing, arresting, thought-provoking or just plain silly&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a delirious collaboration&quot; and hailed MF Doom as a rapper who &quot;understands the deformative power of rhyme&quot; and &quot;delivers long, free-associative verses full of sideways leaps and unexpected twists&quot;. Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the album, noting that &quot;the point of &quot;Madvillainy&quot; is largely poetic—celebrating the language of music and the music of language&quot; and that while the album&#x27;s beats are based on samples of records, it&#x27;s &quot;hard to say which ones, even in a general way&quot;.

===Accolades===
Several publications included &quot;Madvillainy&quot; in their lists of the best albums of the year. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it number six on their list of the 50 best albums of 2004, stating that &quot;the collaboration brings out the best in both men, without copying anything in their catalogs&quot;. &quot;Prefix&quot; ranked the album first on its list of the 60 best albums of 2004, stating that &quot;when Doom and Madlib combine, they form like Voltron&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; positioned it at number nine on their list of the 100 best albums of 2004, commending MF Doom&#x27;s &quot;royal, pop culture-laden flow&quot; and Madlib&#x27;s &quot;beat-mining expertise&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number 17 on their list of the 40 best albums of 2004, praising Madlib&#x27;s production, &quot;thick, woozy slabs of beatnik bass&quot;, that &quot;keeps things hotter than an underground volcano lair&quot;. Washington City Paper ranked Madvillainy number one on their list of the top 20 albums of 2004. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; named it the second best album of 2004.

Numerous publications included &quot;Madvillainy&quot; in various lists of the best albums. &quot;Clash&quot; positioned it at number 47 in their list of top 100 albums of &quot;Clash&quot; lifetime, calling it &quot;slapdash and dilapidated, wholly unconcerned with making sense&quot;, &quot;defined by its flippancy and attitude to professionalism&quot;. The magazine also listed it on their list of ten best hip-hop albums ever, calling it &quot;one of this decade&#x27;s finest hip-hop albums&quot; that &quot;elevated the profile of both [artists] to whole new levels&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; placed the album in their list of 100 best albums available on Spotify, calling it &quot;dusty, weeded up, 22-song masterpiece that stood alone and brought us all into its own little world&quot; and stating that &quot;Madlib and MF Doom&#x27;s classic wasn&#x27;t meant for the radio, but it was too good to be kept to the underground&quot;. The magazine also listed it among 25 albums of the decade that deserve classic status, describing it as &quot;a classic record that had a goofy cartoony unpredictability, balanced with moments of oddball sincerity&quot; and 71st on the list &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Complex Decade&quot;. &quot;HipHopGoldenAge&quot; ranked it first in their list of the Top 150 Hip Hop Albums of the Decade, calling it &quot;a perfect example of what can happen if two left-field geniuses combine powers.&quot;&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; featured the album on the list &quot;The Best Music of the Decade&quot;, referring to the album as &quot;an instant masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Fact&quot; ranked it number 14 at their list of 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised it as &quot;a perfect synergy between raw beats and incredible rhymes&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; ranked the album number 411 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, describing it as &quot;stoner humour and mind-bending beats from a hip-hop dream team&quot; and stating that &quot;MF Doom and Madlib might not have invented underground rap, but they damn well perfected it&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 13 in their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004, commenting, &quot;While Madlib&#x27;s special power played tricks on your ears – a sample you were sure was the sound of cars rolling by on the street might sound like the hiss of a record on a different day (&quot;Rainbows&quot;) – MF Doom unfurled his clever lyrics like a roll of sod on earth... and the album curved in on itself like a two-way mirror.&quot;&quot;Pitchfork&quot; also ranked &quot;Madvillainy&quot; as the 25th best album of the 2000s, describing it as &quot;a preternaturally perfect pairing of like-minded talents&quot; who &quot;have each been responsible for tons of great, grimy underground hip-hop&quot;. &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s.

In 2016 &quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Madvillainy&quot; among the albums that didn&#x27;t appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that &quot;underground hip-hop&#x27;s cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF Doom, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it &quot;a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles&quot;. The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip-hop debut albums since &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib&#x27;s production, based on &quot;an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples&quot;, and stating that the album was &quot;displaying the future of hip-hop&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Madvillainy&quot; influenced a generation of artists. Among some of them are rappers Joey Badass, the late Capital Steez, Bishop Nehru, Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Danny Brown, Kirk Knight, producer and rapper Flying Lotus, producer and DJ Cashmere Cat, neo soul collective Jungle, indie rock band Cults, and Radiohead singer Thom Yorke. The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums. According to Earl Sweatshirt, &quot;Madvillainy&quot; influenced his generation the same way Wu-Tang Clan influenced the rappers of the 1990s with their album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;. In 2009 a video of Mos Def working on his album &quot;The Ecstatic&quot; in a studio was released. In the video he praised Doom, saying that &quot;he rhymes as weird as I feel&quot;, and recited some of Doom&#x27;s lines, including the ones from &quot;Madvillainy&quot;. He added:

In 2015, in honor of the release of All-New, All-Different Marvel comics line and to pay homage to classic and contemporary hip-hop albums, Marvel released variant covers inspired by influential albums. One of them was variant cover of The Mighty Thor comics, based on &quot;Madvillainy&quot; cover. It used grayscale image of Jane Foster&#x27;s face behind the metal mask, with a picture of Mjolnir in a small orange square on top right corner and &quot;THE MIGHTY THOR&quot; text in pixelated font on top left. In 2024, Marvel comics released Doom #1, which opens with the line &quot;living off borrowed time, the clock ticks faster,&quot; in direct reference to the track &quot;Accordion&quot;. According to &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;Madvillainy&quot; Spotify&#x27;s streams have increased by an average of 73 percent, year over year, starting with 183 thousands streams in 2009 (Spotify&#x27;s first full year in operation), and reaching 226 million streams in 2023. In total, &quot;Madvillainy&quot; has accumulated over one billion all-time streams on Spotify, and songs from the album have been featured in over 8.2 million playlists.

On July 23, 2008 Stones Throw announced the release of &quot;Madvillainy 2: The Box&quot;, a box set containing, among other things, a cassette of the leaked &quot;Madvillainy&quot; demo tape. The box was later released on September 15 of that year, marking the first official release of the &quot;Madvillainy&quot; demo.

<text>Madvillain was an American hip hop supergroup formed in 2002, consisting of rapper MF Doom and producer Madlib. Their only album, &quot;Madvillainy&quot; (2004), earned critical acclaim and cult popularity, widely regarded as one of the greatest rap albums of all time and a benchmark record for alternative hip hop. Their intricate rhymes and lyrics, short song structures and use of obscure, stylistically diverse samples made for a sound that was generally unfriendly to commercial radio but was lauded for its influence on underground rap. A follow-up album to &quot;Madvillainy&quot; was rumored to be in production at various times since the late 2000s, but no further original material has surfaced from the duo since 2010, and MF DOOM&#x27;s death in 2020 has left the future of the project uncertain.

== History ==
In 2006, Madvillain was featured on Stones Throw Records and Adult Swim&#x27;s DVD/CD &quot;Chrome Children&quot; with a new song and live performance. Kidrobot followed this by announcing a Madvillain action figure.

Madvillain&#x27;s label Stones Throw announced in 2009 that MF DOOM and Madlib were currently working on a second Madvillain album.

On May 26, 2010, Madvillain released the song &quot;Papermill&quot; via Adult Swim&#x27;s website. On January 3, 2011, Madvillain released the songs &quot;Avalanche&quot; and a remix of the Doomstarks song &quot;Victory Laps&quot; via Stones Throw mixtape.

In late 2011, during an interview at the Red Bull Music Academy in Madrid, MF DOOM admitted that the second Madvillain album had been nearly done for about two years and that it should be out &quot;soon&quot;, sometime after MF DOOM finishes his part on it in &quot;say, January&quot; 2012.

On September 6, 2012, MF DOOM co-hosted Benji B&#x27;s late night BBC Radio 1 show. As well as talking about the origins of Madvillain and what it was like to work with Madlib, he announced during the show that he just had to &quot;touch up a couple of tracks&quot; on the new Madvillain album and said that it should be out by the end of 2012, depending on when Stones Throw choose to release it.

On January 9, 2014, Madlib stated in a &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; interview that it is up to MF DOOM to decide on whether he wants to finish the second Madvillain album, and that he does not have to. &quot;It’s not close to finished because it has to be a continuation of the last one. It doesn&#x27;t have to be better or worse but it has to be a continuation.&quot;

MF DOOM died on October 31, 2020, leaving the future of the project uncertain.

<text>Texas blues is blues music from Texas. As a regional style, its original form was characterized by jazz and swing influences. Later examples are often closer to blues rock and Southern rock.

==History==

Texas blues began to appear in the early 1900s among African Americans who worked in oilfields, ranches and lumber camps. In the 1920s, Blind Lemon Jefferson innovated the style by using jazz-like improvisation and single string accompaniment on a guitar; Jefferson&#x27;s influence defined the field and inspired later performers. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, many bluesmen moved to cities including Galveston, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. It was from these urban centers that a new wave of popular performers appeared, including slide guitarist and gospel singer Blind Willie Johnson. Future bluesmen such as Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Lil&#x27; Son Jackson, and T-Bone Walker were influenced by these developments. Robert Johnson&#x27;s two recording sessions both took place in Texas, although he was from Mississippi.

T-Bone Walker relocated to Los Angeles to record his most influential work in the 1940s. His swing-influenced backing and lead guitar sound became an influential part of the electric blues. It was T-Bone Walker, B.B. King once said, who “really started me to want to play the blues. I can still hear T-Bone in my mind today, from that first record I heard, ‘Stormy Monday.’ He was the first electric guitar player I heard on record. He made me so that I knew I just had to go out and get an electric guitar.” He also influenced Goree Carter, whose &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; (1949) featured an over-driven electric guitar style and has been cited as a strong contender for the &quot;first rock and roll record&quot; title.

The state&#x27;s R&amp;B recording industry was based in Houston with labels such as Duke/Peacock, which in the 1950s provided a base for artists who would later pursue the electric Texas blues sound, including Johnny Copeland and Albert Collins. Freddie King, a major influence on electric blues, was born in Texas, but moved to Chicago as a teenager. His instrumental number &quot;Hide Away&quot; (1961), was emulated by British blues artists including Eric Clapton.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Texas Blues scene began to flourish, influenced by country music and blues rock, particularly in the clubs of Austin. The diverse style often featured instruments such as keyboards and horns with emphasis on guitar soloing. The most prominent artists to emerge in this era were the brothers Johnny and Edgar Winter, who combined traditional and southern styles. In the 1970s, Jimmie Vaughan formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds and in the 1980s his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan broke through to mainstream success with his virtuoso guitar playing, as did ZZ Top with their brand of Southern rock.

<text>Distributed cognition is an approach to cognitive science research that was developed by cognitive anthropologist Edwin Hutchins during the 1990s.

From cognitive ethnography, Hutchins argues that mental representations, which classical cognitive science held that are within the individual brain, are actually distributed in sociocultural systems that constitute the tools to think and perceive the world. Thus, a native of the Carolina Islands can perceive the sky and organize his perceptions of the constellations typical of his culture (the groupings of stars are different than in the traditional constellations of the West) and use the position of the stars in the sky as a map to orient himself in space while sailing overnight in a canoe.

According to Hutchins, cognition involves not only the brain but also external artifacts, work teams made up of several people, and cultural systems for interpreting reality (mythical, scientific, or otherwise).

Distributed cognition theory is part of the interdisciplinary field of embodied cognitive science, also called embodied cognition.

Hutchins&#x27; distributed cognition theory influenced philosopher Andy Clark, who shortly after proposed his own version of the theory, calling it &quot;extended cognition&quot; (see, for example, the paper &quot;The Extended Mind&quot;).

Hutchins&#x27; distributed cognition theory explains mental processes by taking as the fundamental unit of analysis &quot;a collection of individuals and artifacts and their relations to each other in a particular work practice&quot;.

&quot;DCog&quot; is a specific approach to distributed cognition (distinct from other meanings) which takes a computational perspective towards goal-based activity systems.

The distributed cognition approach uses insights from cultural anthropology, sociology, embodied cognitive science, and the psychology of Lev Vygotsky (cf. cultural-historical psychology). It emphasizes the ways that cognition is off-loaded into the environment through social and technological means. It is a framework for studying cognition rather than a type of cognition. This framework involves the coordination between individuals, artifacts and the environment.

According to Zhang &amp; Norman (1994), the distributed cognition approach has three key components:
# Embodiment of information that is embedded in representations of interaction
# Coordination of enaction among embodied agents
# Ecological contributions to a cognitive ecosystem

DCog studies the &quot;propagation of representational states across media&quot;. Mental content is considered to be non-reducible to individual cognition and is more properly understood as off-loaded and extended into the environment, where information is also made available to other agents (Heylighen, Heath, &amp; Overwalle, 2003). It is often understood as an approach in specific opposition to earlier and still prevalent &quot;brain in a vat&quot; models which ignore &quot;situatedness, embodiment and enaction&quot; as key to any cognitive act (Ibid.).

These representation-based frameworks consider distributed cognition as &quot;a cognitive system whose structures and processes are distributed between internal and external representations, across a group of individuals, and across space and time&quot; (Zhang and Patel, 2006). In general terms, they consider a distributed cognition system to have two components: internal and external representations. In their description, internal representations are knowledge and structure in individuals&#x27; minds while external representations are knowledge and structure in the external environment (Zhang, 1997b; Zhang and Norman, 1994).

DCog studies the ways that memories, facts, or knowledge is embedded in the objects, individuals, and tools in our environment. DCog is a useful approach for designing the technologically mediated social aspects of cognition by putting emphasis on the individual and his/her environment, and the media channels with which people interact, either in order to communicate with each other, or socially coordinate to perform complex tasks. Distributed cognition views a system of cognition as a set of representations propagated through specific media, and models the interchange of information between these representational media. These representations can be either in the mental space of the participants or external representations available in the environment.

These interactions can be categorized into three distinct types of processes: 
# Cognitive processes may be distributed across the members of a social group.
# Cognitive processes may be distributed in the sense that the operation of the cognitive system involves coordination between internal and external (material or environmental) structure.
# Processes may be distributed through time in such a way that the products of earlier events can transform the nature of related events.

==Early research==
John Milton Roberts thought that social organization could be seen as cognition through a community . He described the cognitive aspects of a society by looking at the present information and how it moves through the people in the society.

Daniel L. Schwartz (1978) proposed a distribution of cognition through culture and the distribution of beliefs across the members of a society.

In 1998, Mark Perry from Brunel University London explored the problems and the benefits brought by distributed cognition to &quot;understanding the organisation of information within its contexts.&quot; He considered that distributed cognition draws from the information processing metaphor of cognitive science where a system is considered in terms of its inputs and outputs and tasks are decomposed into a problem space. He believed that information should be studied through the representation within the media or artifact that represents the information. Cognition is said to be &quot;socially distributed&quot; when it is applied to demonstrate how interpersonal processes can be used to coordinate activity within a social group.

In 1997, Gavriel Salomon stated that there were two classes of distributive cognition: shared cognition and off-loading. Shared cognition is that which is shared among people through common activity such as conversation where there is a constant change of cognition based on the other person&#x27;s responses. An example of off-loading would be using a calculator to do arithmetic or creating a grocery list when going shopping. In that sense, the cognitive duties are off-loaded to a material object.

Later, John Sutton (2006) defined five appropriate domains of investigation for research in Dcog:
# External cultural tools, artifacts, and symbol systems.
# Natural environmental resources.
# Interpersonal and social distribution or scaffolding.
# Embodied capacities and skills.
# Internalized cognitive artifacts.

==Theory==
In ontogenesis, the first act of the mental representation distribution succeeds in the mother-child dyad that constitutes in the child the tools to think and perceive the world. Based on evidence in hyperscanning research and psychophysiological research studies, Research Professor Igor Val Danilov developed the Shared intentionality notion first introduced by Professor of psychology Michael Tomasello. According to the hypothesis, the mother distributes the mental representation to the child to teach the young nervous system how to respond to environmental changes correctly. Due to this ecological learning, the child grasps the perception of objects and begins to cognize the environment at the simple reflexes stage of development without communication and abstract thinking. According to Igor Val Danilov, Shared intentionality switches on cognition in the child beginning from the embryonal period.

==Applications==
The application area of DCog is systems design and implementation in specific work environments. Its main method is field research, going into the workplace and making rigorous observations, e.g. through capturing work performances with video, studying and coding the recorded activities using qualitative research methods to codify the various ways in which cognition is distributed in the local environment, through the social and technical systems with which the workers engage.

Distributed cognition as a theory of learning, i.e. one in which the development of knowledge is attributed to the system of thinking agents interacting dynamically with artifacts, has been widely applied in the field of distance learning, especially in relation to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and other computer-supported learning tools. For example, in the field of teaching English Composition, Kevin LaGrandeur has argued that CSCL provides a source of common memory, collaborative space, and a cognitive artifact (tool to enhance cognition) that allows students to more easily build effective written compositions via explicit and implicit machine-human collaboration. Distributed cognition illustrates the process of interaction between people and technologies in order to determine how to best represent, store and provide access to digital resources and other artifacts.

Collaborative tagging on the World Wide Web is one of the most recent developments in technological support for distributed cognition. Beginning in 2004 and quickly becoming a standard on websites, collaborative tagging allows users to upload or select materials (e.g. pictures, music files, texts, websites) and associate tags with these materials. Tags can be chosen freely, and are similar to keywords. Other users can then browse through tags; a click on a tag connects a user to similarly tagged materials. Tags furthermore enable tag clouds, which graphically represent the popularity of tags, demonstrating co-occurrence relations between tags and thus jump from one tag to another.

Dcog has also been used to understand learning and communication in clinical settings and to obtain an integrated view of clinical workplace learning. It has been observed how medical actors use and connect gestural practices, along with visual and haptic structures of their own bodies and of artifacts such as technological instruments and computational devices. In so doing they co-construct complex, multimodal representations that go beyond the mental representations usually studied from a cognitive perspective of learning.

Distributed cognition can also be seen through cultures and communities. Learning certain habits or following certain traditions is seen as cognition distributed over a group of people. Exploring distributed cognition through community and culture is one way to understand how it may work.

With the new research that is emerging in this field, the overarching concept of distributed cognition enhances the understanding of interactions between individual human beings and artifacts such as technologies and machines, and complex external environments. This concept has been applied to educational research in the areas of distributed leadership and distributed instruction.

Distributed cognition between internal and external processing has also been used to study problem-solving and Bayesian reasoning. For example, it has been observed that the use of external manipulable materials such as cards and tokens can help improve performance and reduce cognitive bias such as the base-rate fallacy, even among adult problem-solvers, as long as they physically interact with these artefacts. It has also been reported that interacting with tokens can reduce the impact of mathematical anxiety on mental calculation performance and supports insight although the evidence is mixed with regards to the impact of distributing cognition between internal and external processing with regards to insight.

==Metaphors and examples==
Distributed cognition is seen when using paper and pencil to do a complicated arithmetic problem. The person doing the problem may talk with a friend to clarify the problem, and then must write the partial answers on the paper in order to be able to keep track of all the steps in the calculation. In this example, the parts of distributed cognition are seen in:
* setting up the problem, in collaboration with another person,
* performing manipulation/arithmetic procedures, both in one&#x27;s head and by writing down resulting partial answers.

The process of working out the answer requires not only the perception and thought of two people, it also requires the use of a tool (paper) to extend an individual&#x27;s memory. So the intelligence is distributed, both between people, and a person and an object.

Another well-researched site for analyzing distributed cognition and applying the discovered insights towards the design of more optimal systems is aviation, where both cockpits and air traffic control environments have been studied as scenes that technologically and socially distribute cognition through systems of externalized representational media. It is not the cognitive performance and expertise of any one single person or machine that is important for the continued operation or the landing and takeoff of airplanes. The cognition is distributed over the personnel, sensors, and machinery both in the plane and on the ground, including but not limited to the controllers, pilots and crew as a whole.

Hutchins also examined another scene of distributed cognition within the context of navigating a US navy vessel. In his book on USS Palau, he explains in detail how distributed cognition is manifested through the interaction between crew members as they interpret, process, and transform information into various representational states in order to safely navigate the ship. In this functional unit, crew members (e.g. pelorus operators, bearing takers, plotters, and the ship&#x27;s captain) play the role of actors who transform information into different representational states (i.e. triangulation, landmark sightings, bearings, and maps). In this context, navigation is embodied through the combined efforts of actors in the functional unit.

In his study on process, representation and task world, Mark Perry demonstrated how distributed cognition analysis can be conducted in a field study. His example was design analysis in Civil engineering. In this work, he showed how an information processing approach can be applied by carrying a detailed analysis of the background of the study - goals and resources, inputs and outputs, representations and processes, and transformational activity, &quot;how information was transformed from the design drawings and site onto tables of measurements (different representations)&quot; and then onto &quot;a graphical representation&quot; which provided a clearer demonstration of the relationship between the two data sets.

<doc id="989156" wikidata="Q1434067" url="?curid=989156" title="United States Aviator Badge">
<text>A United States Aviator Badge refers to three types of aviation badges issued by the United States Armed Forces, those being for Air Force, Army, and Naval (to include Marine and Coast Guard) aviation.

Air Force Pilot and Army Aviator Badges are issued in three ratings: Basic, Senior, and Command (Air Force)/Master (Army). The higher degrees are denoted by a star or star with wreath above the badge. Air Force regulations state that the basic rating denotes completion of specified training and that the advanced ratings denote experience levels. The Naval Aviator Badge is issued to pilots upon designation as a Naval Aviator for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard aviators who successfully complete flight training. There is a single badge design regardless of an individual’s further qualifications.

==United States Air Force==
===World War I===
The first United States Aviator Badges were issued to members of the Air Service during World War I. The badges were issued in three degrees: Observer (a &quot;US&quot; shield and one left-side wing), Junior Aviator or Reserve Aviation Officer (a &quot;US&quot; shield between two wings), and Senior Aviator (a star over &quot;US&quot; shield between two wings). The Army Air Service also issued a badge for balloon pilots, known as the Aeronaut Badge.

Enlisted Aviators wore their regular rank insignia and the Observer&#x27;s badge. There were 29 enlisted pilots before the American entry into World War I. The second enlisted aviator, William A. Lamkey, got a discharge and flew for Pancho Villa. The remaining enlisted pilots received commissions in 1917. There were 60 enlisted mechanics who were trained as pilots in France during the war, but they were used for ferrying duties and did not fly in combat. The recruiting and training of enlisted Aviators ended in 1933.

===World War II===
During World War II, with the rise of the Army Air Forces, a second series of aviator badges were issued to include a design that has survived to the modern day. The Pilot Badge was issued in three degrees, including Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Command Pilot. A polished silver colored version of these badges is currently used as the United States Air Force Pilot Badges.

From August 1941 to November 1942, the Enlisted Aviator program was restarted. Candidates had to be at least 18, possess a high school diploma, and have graduated at the top of their high school class. Graduates were rated as Flight Staff Sergeants or Flight Technical Sergeants and wore the same pilot&#x27;s wings as officers. They were usually assigned to pilots of transport and auxiliary aircraft to free officer pilots to pilot the more prestigious fighters and bombers. Auxiliary pilots received their own special wings to indicate their status and specialty. In November 1942 all enlisted pilots were promoted to Flight Officer rank and enlisted cadets were graded as Flight Officers or Second Lieutenants depending on merit. The qualifying requirements for the Senior Pilot Wings are: Seven (7) years as rated pilot and permanent award of pilot rating. Plus 2000 total hours or 1300 hours primary and instructor flight (refer to U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating for details).

===Independent Air Force===
In 1947, the U.S. Army Air Forces became its own separate service as the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force use the same pilot&#x27;s badges as the earlier USAAF design, except that starting in the mid-1990s, they began to be made of chrome metal or sterling silver rather than the dull alloy wings used by the Army Air Forces and Air Force from 1947 to the mid-1990s. The U.S. Air Force currently issues several aviation badges including pilot, combat systems officer (formerly navigator), air battle manager, flight surgeon, flight nurse, non-rated officer aircrew, and enlisted aircrew. The requirements to earn these are listed here.

==United States Army==

After the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947, Army Aviation continued to a degree that warranted a new badge for Army Aviators (who piloted light observation and liaison airplanes and helicopters). The result was the creation of the Army Aviator Badge, which is a modified version of the U.S. Air Force Pilot Badge. It comes in three grades: Basic, Senior (7 years&#x27; service and 1,000 flight hours, pilot-in-command status), and Master (15 years&#x27; service and 2,000 flight hours, pilot-in-command status). The Aviator and Senior Aviator Badges were approved on 27 July 1950 and the Master Aviator Badge was approved on 12 February 1957.

==United States Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard==

The aviator badge currently used in the Navy has remained virtually unchanged since it was first issued on 13 November 1917. The Naval Aviator Badge is earned by all U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard aviators upon graduation from advanced flight training. Additional aviator badges exist for Naval Flight Officers (USN &amp; USMC), Naval Flight Surgeons, Naval Aviation Physiologists, Naval Flight Nurses, Naval Aviation Observers (USN &amp; USMC) and enlisted Naval Aircrewman (USN, USMC &amp; USCG). Naval Aviators&#x27; badges are gold in color. Unlike the Air Force and the Army, the naval services do not employ senior or command/master aeronautical ratings.

==NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps==

The NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps Aviator Insignia is a gold-colored pin, winged, with a central device consisting of a fouled anchor surcharged with a NOAA Corps device. NOAA Corps officer pilots and navigators may wear the NOAA aviator insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps.

==NASA==
With the dawn of the Space Age, all of the United States Aviator badges are upgradable to the Astronaut Badge, for those military members who become astronauts.

<doc id="989157" wikidata="Q697605" url="?curid=989157" title="Wokou">
<text>Wokou (; ; ; ), which translates to &quot;Japanese pirates&quot;, were pirates who raided the coastlines of China and Korea from the 13th century to the 17th century. The wokou were made of various ethnicities of East Asian ancestry, which varied over time and raided the mainland from islands in the Sea of Japan and East China Sea. Wokou activity in Korea declined after the Treaty of Gyehae in 1443 but continued in Ming China and peaked during the Jiajing wokou raids in the mid-16th century. Chinese reprisals and strong clamp-downs on pirates by Japanese authorities saw the wokou disappear by the 17th century.

== History ==
There are two distinct eras of wokou piracy. The early wokou mostly set up camp on the outlying islands of the Japanese archipelago in the Sea of Japan, as opposed to the 16th-century wokou who were mostly non-Japanese. The early wokou raided the Japanese as well as the Chinese and Koreans.

The first recorded use of the term wokou (倭寇) is on the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in modern Ji&#x27;an, Jilin, China to celebrate the exploits of Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo (). The stele states that &quot;wokou&quot; (&quot;Japanese robbers&quot;) crossed the sea and were defeated by him in 404. The term wokou is a combination of the Chinese terms &quot;Wō&quot; (倭), referring to either dwarfs or pejoratively to the Japanese, and &quot;kòu&quot; () &quot;bandit&quot;.

===Early wokou===
The origin of the term wokou dates back to the 4th century, but among wokou&#x27;s activities, which are divided into two academic periods, the pirates called &quot;early wokou&quot; were borne from the Mongol invasions of Japan. As a result of the war, the coastal defense capabilities of China and Korea were significantly reduced, and the people living in Tsushima, Iki, and Gotō Islands in Kyushu suffered extreme poverty. For these reasons, wokou gradually intensified their looting on the coasts of China and Korea. Chŏng Mong-ju was dispatched to Japan to deal with the problem. During his visit, Kyushu governor Imagawa Sadayo suppressed the wokou, returning their captured property and people to Korea. In 1405, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu sent 20 captured pirates to China, where they were boiled in a cauldron in Ningbo.

According to Korean records, wokou were particularly rampant roughly from 1350. After almost annual invasions of the southern provinces of Jeolla and Gyeongsang, they migrated northwards to the Chungcheong and Gyeonggi areas. The &quot;History of Goryeo&quot; has a record of sea battles in 1380 whereby one hundred warships were sent to Jinpo to rout Japanese pirates there, releasing 334 captives. Wokou sorties decreased thereafter. The wokou were effectively expelled through the use of gunpowder technology, which the wokou lacked, after Goryeo founded the Office of Gunpowder Weapons in 1377 (which was abolished twelve years later).

In 1419, the Korean army landed in Tsushima and started the Ōei Invasion, the largest operation against the wokou. General Yi Jongmu&#x27;s fleet of 227 ships and 17,285 soldiers set off from Geoje Island toward Tsushima on 19 June 1419. According to &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot; a Korean history book, on 20 June the Korean army captured 129 wokou ships, burned 1,939 houses, killed 114 people, captured 21 people, and rescued 131 Chinese who the wokou had captured. On 29 June, they burned 15 wokou ships and 68 houses, killed 9 people, and rescued 15 people, including Chinese and Koreans, who had been held captive, but more than 100 soldiers were killed by wokou. On 3 July, the Korean army withdrew to Geoje Island and finally withdrew completely after giving up the re-landing and occupation of Tsushima because of the loss of Korean army and worsening weather. In the record of 10 July, the number of soldiers killed by wokou was rectified to 180. On the other hand, according to historical documents recorded by the Sō clan, the death toll of the Korean army was 2,500.

When the Treaty of Gyehae was concluded between the Joseon and Sō Sadamori of Tsushima in 1443 and the Sō clan was given trade privileges, wokou&#x27;s activities along the Korean Peninsula calmed down. Some of the coastal forts built for defense against wokou can still be found in Zhejiang and Fujian. Among them are the well-restored Pucheng Fortress (in Cangnan County, Zhejiang) and Chongwu Fortress (in Chongwu, Huai&#x27;an County, Fujian), as well as the ruins of the Liu&#x27;ao Fortress in Liu&#x27;ao, Fujian.

===Later wokou===
In attempts to centralize political control, the Ming dynasty enacted trade bans with the consensus being that &quot;unrestricted trade would lead to chaos&quot;. With maritime trade outlawed, China&#x27;s navy was reduced, and as a result, they could not combat increased smuggling, which led to wokou control over the southeastern coast. Although wokou means &quot;Japanese pirates&quot;, major wokou groups in the 16th century were led by Chinese traders whose livelihoods were halted by the Ming trade bans. According to the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, 30% of the 16th-century wokou were Japanese, and 70% were ethnic Chinese. According to Censor Du Zhonglu, in a memorial dated 1553, the pirates were 10% barbarian people, 20% Ryukyuan people, and the rest from Fujian and Ningbo areas of China. According to Ray Huang, a Chinese-American historian, the Japanese pirates frequently collaborated with Chinese groups. Japan served as a base for the pirates, and the Japanese provided much of the military expertise and equipment to the pirates. Because of the extent of corruption in the Ming court, many Chinese officials had relations with the pirates and benefited from the piracy, making it difficult for central authorities to control.

Two well-known Chinese military figures involved in combating the wokou were Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou. Yu Dayou was a Ming dynasty general assigned to defend the coast against the wokou. In 1553, a young man named Qi Jiguang became the Assistant Regional Military Commissioner of the Ming dynasty. He was assigned to &quot;punish the bandits and guard the people&quot;, which meant taking on the wokou attacking the Ming east coast. At that time, he was 26 years old. On the eve of the following year, he was promoted to the full commissioner in Zhejiang because of his successes.

The wokou even entered the Philippines before their extermination in the 17th century. Aparri in northern Luzon was established as a pirate city-state under the patronage of the wokou. The area around Aparri was the site of the 1582 Cagayan battles between wokou and Spanish soldiers. The wokou were not limited to Aparri. The pirate-warlord Limahong attempted and failed to invade Manila and afterwards set up a temporary pirate state in Caboloan (Pangasinan) before the Spanish expelled him.

==Controversy over identity==
The identity of the wokou is subject to some debate, with various theories about the ethnic makeup and national origin of the pirates.

Professor Takeo Tanaka of University of Tokyo proposed in 1966 that the early wokou were Koreans living on these outlying islands. In the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, the compiled section for King Sejong relates that a vassal named Yi Sun-mong (, 1386–1449) told his monarch &quot;I hear that in the late Goryeo kingdom period, wokou roaming (our country) and the peasants could not withstand them. However only 1 or 2 (out of 10) were caused by (real) Japanese. Some of our peasants imitatively wore Japanese clothing, formed a group and caused trouble... in order to stop all evils, there is nothing more urgent than the &quot;Hopae&quot; (personal identification system)&quot;. However, Yi did not live during the Goryeo dynasty and was likely relating rumor or legend as opposed to solid documented evidence. Moreover, the thrust of Yi&#x27;s speech concentrates on how national security was deteriorating and how it required special attention; it is possible he made use of unreliable information to support his point. Yi&#x27;s assertion is therefore not highly valued as a source for wokou by other researchers. &quot;Goryeosa&quot; records 529 wokou raids during the 1223–1392 period but mentions the &quot;fake Japanese&quot; only three times.

The current prevailing theory is that of Shōsuke Murai, who demonstrated in 1988 that the early wokou came from multiple ethnic groups rather than one singular nation. Murai writes that the wokou were &quot;marginal men&quot; living in politically unstable areas without national allegiances, akin to the Zomia thesis. Supporters of this theory point out that one of the early wokou leaders, Ajibaldo, was variously claimed by period sources to be Mongolian, Japanese, Korean, and an &quot;islander&quot;; his name is apparently Korean and Mongolian in origin.

<text>Edwin Hutchins (born 1948) is a professor and former department head of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego. Hutchins is one of the main developers of distributed cognition.

Hutchins was a student of the cognitive anthropologist Roy D&#x27;Andrade and has been a strong advocate of the use of anthropological methods in cognitive science. He is considered the father of modern cognitive ethnography. His early work involved studies of logic in legal discourse among people of the Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea.

For a time he worked in the Navy doing research on how crews of a ship can function as a distributed machine, offloading the cognitive burden of ship navigation onto each member of the crew. He was a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot;.

In 1995, Hutchins published &quot;Cognition in the Wild&quot;, a detailed study of distributed cognitive processes in a navy ship (an &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship); like other works related to distributed cognition, it criticizes disembodied views of cognition and proposes an alternative which looks at cognitive systems that may be composed of multiple agents and the material world.

Other areas of his work include the study of airline cockpits, the development of cognitive ethnographic methods and tools, and human-computer interaction. He ran the Distributed Cognition and Human Computer Interaction Laboratory at UC San Diego, in collaboration with James Hollan until 2014. He is now professor emeritus in the UC San Diego Department of Cognitive Science.

<text>Terresa Graves (January 10, 1948October 10, 2002), credited as Teresa Graves, was an American actress and singer, best known for her starring role as undercover police detective Christie Love in the ABC crime-drama television series &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot; (1974–1975). 
The role made Graves the second African-American female to star in a non-stereotypical role for a U.S. drama television series. The first was 
Diahann Carroll in &quot;Julia&quot;, which aired 3 years earlier from 1968 to 1971. The &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot; series was based on Dorothy Uhnak&#x27;s crime-thriller novel &quot;The Ledger&quot;.

==Career==
===Singing===
Graves was born on January 10, 1948, the middle of three children in Houston, Texas to Marshall (1921–1967) and Willie Graves (1920–2005). The family moved to Los Angeles, California, when she was five. In high school she was a 4.0 student, active in both glee club and drama society; her senior class voted her &quot;Most Talented&quot;. Her vocal talent brought her to the attention of the Doodletown Pipers founder George Wilkins in 1966. After graduating from George Washington Preparatory High School in 1966, Graves elected to take his offer to join the singing group over a fully paid music scholarship to USC. She spent the next three years touring North America with the Pipers. It was with the group that she made her initial television appearances. She also recorded a self-titled album in 1970.

===Acting===
She soon turned to acting and became a regular in the two variety shows: &quot;Our Place&quot; (1967) and the infamous single episode of &quot;Turn-On&quot; (1969). In 1969, Graves toured with Bob Hope&#x27;s USO tour in Southeast Asia. Graves later landed more acting roles, becoming a regular on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; during its third season. Graves appeared in several films. In the 1973 film &quot;That Man Bolt&quot;, in which she played Samantha Nightingale, Graves&#x27; character is shot to death when she is in bed during a love scene with Fred Williamson, who plays the leading role of Jefferson Bolt.

Graves pivotal role in the 1974 ABC crime drama television movie and later series &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot; featured Charles Cioffi and Jack Kelly as Lieutenants Reardon and Ryan, respectively, Love&#x27;s supervisors. At the time of the series creation, Graves&#x27; was noted as the second African-American woman to star in her own hour–long television series, after Diahann Carroll in &quot;Julia&quot; which aired six years prior. An article in the November 1974 issue of &quot;Jet&quot; magazine described Graves as &quot;television&#x27;s most delightful detective, the epitome of a tough lady cop with more feminine features than Venus&quot;. In 1983, Graves retired from show business to devote her time to her faith.

==Personal life and death==
Graves married William Reddick in 1977. They divorced in 1983. They had no children together.

 Graves was baptized as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness in 1974, and almost immediately began using her celebrity to bring international awareness to the brutal persecution of Witnesses in Malawi under then-leader Hastings Kamuzu Banda&#x27;s &quot;one-party rule&quot;.

Due to moral conflicts with scripts and other aspects in the entertainment industry, Graves chose to retire from acting and performing in 1984. She then devoted all of her time to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses activities. She resided at 3437 West 78th Place in the Hyde Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, where she cared for her mother. On October 10, 2002, Graves&#x27; home caught fire due to a faulty space heater. Graves was found unconscious in a bedroom before being rushed to the hospital where she later died. She was 54 years old.

<doc id="989173" wikidata="Q1569899" url="?curid=989173" title="Tower of Power">
<text>Tower of Power is an American R&amp;B and funk based band and horn section, originating in Oakland, California, that has been performing since 1968. The band has had a number of lead vocalists, the best-known being Lenny Williams, who fronted the band between early 1973 and late 1974, the period of their greatest commercial success. They have had eight songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; their highest-charting songs include &quot;You&#x27;re Still a Young Man&quot;, &quot;So Very Hard to Go&quot;, &quot;What Is Hip?&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Horses (in the Middle of a Stream)&quot;.

==History==
In the summer of 1968, tenor saxophonist/vocalist Emilio Castillo met Stephen &quot;Doc&quot; Kupka, who played baritone sax. Castillo had played in several bands, and hired Kupka after a home audition on the advice of his father. Within months the group, then known as The Motowns, began playing various gigs around Oakland and Berkeley, attracting audiences from minority and counterculture communities.

In order to play Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, the band changed its name to Tower of Power, which then stuck.

By 1970, the renamed band—now including trumpet/arranger Greg Adams, first trumpet Mic Gillette, first saxophone Skip Mesquite, Francis &quot;Rocco&quot; Prestia on bass, Willie Fulton on guitar, and drummer David Garibaldi—signed a recording contract with Bill Graham&#x27;s San Francisco Records and released their first album, &quot;East Bay Grease&quot;. Rufus Miller performed most of the lead vocals on this debut album. The group was first introduced to the San Francisco Bay area by radio station KSAN, which played a variety of artists such as Cold Blood, Eric Mercury, and Marvin Gaye.

Augmented by percussionist/conga/bongo player Brent Byars, Tower of Power was released from their San Francisco label contract and moved to Warner Bros. Records. Rick Stevens replaced Rufus Miller as lead singer on 1972&#x27;s &quot;Bump City,&quot; which gave the band their first national exposure. This album included the hit single &quot;You&#x27;re Still a Young Man&quot;, which peaked at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Stevens&#x27; pinnacle vocal performance before leaving the band. Emilio Castillo, who co-wrote the tune with Stephen Kupka, told Songfacts that the song was based on a true story about him and a former girlfriend who was six years his senior.

&quot;Tower of Power&quot;, released in the spring of 1973, was the third album for the band. It featured soul singer Lenny Williams on lead vocals and Lenny Pickett on lead tenor saxophone. Bruce Conte replaced guitarist Willie Fulton and keyboardist Chester D.Thompson also joined the band during the recording of the album. The album spawned their most-successful single &quot;So Very Hard to Go&quot;. Although the single peaked at #17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it was included in the Top 10 in the surveys of many West Coast Top 40 radio stations, placed #1 on several of them. The album also charted two other singles on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;This Time It&#x27;s Real&quot; and &quot;What Is Hip?&quot;

1974&#x27;s &quot;Back to Oakland&quot; spawned the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Horses (in the Middle of a Stream)&quot;, which reached #26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;, which charted at #69. The funk-jazz instrumental &quot;Squib Cakes&quot; also came from this album.

On &quot;Urban Renewal&quot; (1974), the band moved more toward funk than soul; however, they continued recording ballads as well. Williams left the band in late 1974, and was replaced as vocalist by Hubert Tubbs. The band&#x27;s airplay on chart radio declined. During the late 1970s they briefly tried recording disco-sounding material.

On January 12, 2017, long-time drummer David Garibaldi and bassist Marc Van Wageningen were hit by a train as they walked across tracks before a performance in Oakland. They both survived the accident. According to their manager, Jeremy Westby, they were both &quot;responsive and being treated at a local hospital&quot;. They fully recovered and returned to the active lineup later that year.

== Collaborations ==
Tower&#x27;s horn section appeared on a number of other artists&#x27; recordings, including Otis Redding, Aaron Neville, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, David Sanborn, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Labelle, Huey Lewis, Little Feat, Heart, Michelle Shocked, Paula Abdul, Santana and Stevie Nicks.

The horn section also recorded with bassist Larry Graham&#x27;s Graham Central Station, Grateful Dead, Carlos Santana, Journey, Elkie Brooks, Cat Stevens (on his &quot;Foreigner Suite&quot;), Luis Miguel, Linda Lewis, R.A.D. (Rose Ann Dimalanta), Jermaine Jackson, John Lee Hooker, Helen Reddy, Rufus, Rod Stewart, Jefferson Starship, Mickey Hart, Heart, Damn Yankees, Frankie Valli, Spyro Gyra, KMFDM, Lyle Lovett, Poison, Phish (two songs on their album &quot;Hoist&quot; ), Toto, Pharoahe Monch, Ned Doheny, Brothers Johnson, and Sam The, among many other acts.

The song &quot;So Very Hard To Go&quot; was featured on the soundtracks of the 2002 film &quot;City of God&quot;, and Will Ferrell&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;.

<text>The Pact of San Sebastián was a meeting led by Niceto Alcalá Zamora and Miguel Maura, which took place in San Sebastián, Spain on 17 August 1930. Representatives from practically all republican political movements in Spain at the time attended the meeting. Presided over by Fernando Sasiaín (representative of the Unión Republicana), the attendees included:

:- from the Radical Republican Party: Alejandro Lerroux;
:- from the Republican Action: Manuel Azaña;
:- from the Radical Socialist Republican Party: Marcelino Domingo, Álvaro de Albornoz and Ángel Galarza;
:- from the Liberal Republican Right: Niceto Alcalá Zamora and Miguel Maura;
:- from Catalan Action: Manuel Carrasco Formiguera;
:- from the Republican Action of Catalonia: Matías Mallol Bosch;
:- from the Estat Català: Jaume Aiguader;
:- from the Autonomous Galician Republican Organization: Santiago Casares Quiroga;
:- in their own right: Indalecio Prieto, Felipe Sánchez Román, Fernando de los Ríos, and Eduardo Ortega y Gasset, brother of philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. Gregorio Marañón was not able to attend, but sent a letter associating himself with the group.

At the meeting, a &quot;revolutionary committee&quot; was formed, headed by Alcalá-Zamora; this committee eventually became the first provisional government of the Second Spanish Republic. The committee was in close contact with a group of soldiers, with the intent of bringing about a military coup in favor of a republic. The coup was set for 15 December 1930. Nonetheless, Captain Fermín Galán attempted to start the uprising on 12 December, which resulted in the failure of the coup. Galán and Captain Ángel García Hernández were executed by a firing squad.

<doc id="989184" wikidata="Q1757956" url="?curid=989184" title="Wagyu">
<text>Wagyu (, Hepburn: &quot;wagyū&quot;, ) is the collective name for the four principal Japanese breeds of beef cattle. All wagyū cattle originate from early twentieth-century cross-breeding between native Japanese cattle and imported stock, mostly from Europe.

Wagyu beef is among the most expensive meats in the world. It features marbling, meaning that streaks of fat exist within the red meat that make it tender and moist, while adding flavor. Wagyu beef is often known by different names depending on its place of origin. In several Japanese prefectures, Wagyu beef is shipped with an area name; examples include Matsusaka beef, Kobe beef from the Tajima cattle, Yonezawa beef and Ōmi beef. In recent years, Wagyu beef has increased in fat percentage due to a decrease in grazing and an increase in the use of feed, resulting in larger, fattier cattle.

== Definition ==
Wagyu refers to &quot;Japanese cattle&quot; and is not a specific breed, derived from &quot;Wa&quot; means Japanese and &quot;Gyu&quot; means cow. Japanese native cattle became almost extinct after the Meiji Restoration (1868), mainly as a result of crossbreeding with European breeds, with exceptions such as the Mishima cattle. There are only a few hundred Japanese native cattle, and meat from these cattle is seldom sold on the market. Today, Wagyu refers to four breeds known as &quot;improved Wagyu&quot; (, &quot;kairyō wagyū&quot;), which have been established as distinct breeds through crossbreeding with European cattle.

The rich marbling that is considered a characteristic of Wagyu is actually a feature of the Japanese Black breed, and not of the other three breeds. This is often misunderstood because the Japanese Black currently accounts for 97% of all Wagyu raised in Japan.

In 2001, bovine spongiform encephalopathy was reported in Japanese cattle and became a major social problem. Since then, stringent testing and registration measures for cattle in Japan have been implemented. Since 2007, only four breeds of &quot;kairyō wagyū&quot; and their crossbreds, as well as cattle born, raised, and duly registered in Japan, have been allowed to be labeled as Wagyu.

Western breeds such as Holstein and Jersey are also raised in Japan for dairy cattle. When meat from these cattle is sold in Japan, it must be labeled &quot;domestic beef&quot; (), not &quot;Wagyu.&quot; 

==Origin==

In 1927, fossils of an ancient wild cattle, &quot;Hanaizumi Moriushi&quot; (Leptobison hanaizumiensis), dating from the Paleolithic period about 20,000 years ago, were discovered at the Hanaizumi Site in Ichinoseki City, Iwate Prefecture. The &quot;Hanaizumi Moriushi&quot; is a species similar to the bison and is said to be close to the steppe bison (Bison priscus) lineage. Fossil bones of Aurochs (Bos primigenius) have also been found in Ichinoseki City. Since Hokkaido and Honshu were land-locked with the Eurasian continent during the Ice Age, these animals came from the continent via Hokkaido.

In addition, projectile points made from polished wild cattle bones have been found at the same site, although in small quantities, suggesting that humans existed during this period and that &quot;Hanaizumi Moriushi&quot; and aurochs were hunted.

At the Ohama Site in Goto City, Nagasaki Prefecture, cattle teeth dating to the middle Yayoi period were excavated. Among them were also processed cattle molars. However, this excavation was controversial because it contradicted the statement in Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (Wajinden) that there were no cattle or horses in Japan. Later, radiocarbon dating of the excavated cattle molars yielded a date of around 40 AD (±90 years).

However, some in the Japanese archaeological community remain skeptical about the presence of cattle in Japan during the Yayoi period, and there is a persistent view that they were brought to Japan from the Korean peninsula by the &quot;toraijin&quot;, a group of people who came to Japan in the mid-5th century during the Kofun period. At the Nango-Ōhigashi site in Gose City, Nara Prefecture, excavations revealed cow bones believed to date back to the 5th century. At the Funamiya Kofun Tumulus (late 5th century) in Asago City, Hyōgo Prefecture, pieces of a cow-shaped haniwa (clay figurine), believed to be the oldest in Japan, have been excavated. In addition, a cow-shaped haniwa was excavated from the Hashida No. 1 Tumulus in Tawaramoto Town, Shiki-gun, Nara Prefecture in the first half of the 6th century, and was designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan in 1958.

On the other hand, recent genetic studies have shown that Wagyu and Korean cattle (Hanwoo and others) differ greatly in their genetic information. Livestock cattle are divided into two major lineages: northern lineage cattle (Bos taurus) and Indian lineage cattle (Bos indicus), and both Wagyu and Korean cattle belong to the northern lineage and do not contain Indian lineage such as Zebu cattle.

However, in terms of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, haplogroup T4 (East Asian type) is predominant in the Wagyu (Japanese Black) at about 65%, while haplogroup T3 (European type) is predominant in Korean cattle at 66-83%.

T4 is a haplogroup unique to East Asia that is not observed in Near Eastern, European, and African cattle, and T3 is the predominant haplogroup in European cattle, but T3 is also predominant in Korean cattle. This means that the present breed of Korean cattle is not the main ancestor of the Wagyu.

In addition, haplogroup P has additionally been detected in about 46% of the Japanese Shorthorn. It has been detected in many extinct European aurochs, but has only been found in a total of three current livestock cattle—one Chinese and two Korean—out of several thousand individuals in the database.

The Japanese Shorthorn was created by crossing the Nanbu cattle bred in the former Nanbu Domain territory in northeastern Japan (present-day Iwate Prefecture) with Shorthorns and other breeds imported from the United States, but P has not been detected in Shorthorns and is thought to be derived from the Nanbu cattle.

Fossils of &quot;Hanaizumi Moriushi&quot; and Aurochs have been found in Iwate Prefecture, but it is unclear if the Nanbu cattle were related to these. Haplogroup P has also been found in Chinese and Korean cattle, but it is extremely rare compared to T4. Therefore, it is suggested that the ancestors of the Nanbu cattle have a different origin from the ancestors of the Japanese Black in western Japan, where T4 is abundant, and that there is no single ancestor of the Wagyu.

== History ==
Cattle were brought to Japan from the Korean Peninsula or China, but archaeological and genetic studies have proposed different dates for their arrival, ranging from around the turn of the era to the 5th century.

=== Nara period (710-794) ===
In 675, due to the influence of Buddhism, Emperor Tenmu issued a decree banning meat eating, and eating cattle was officially prohibited in Japan. However, a study of human excrement excavated from the Heijo Palace site has revealed that Japanese people in the Nara period (710–794) continued to eat cattle even after the prohibition. In addition, the Yoro Code (757) stipulates that when a government-owned horse and ox die, it should be dismembered and the skin, brain, horns, and gall bladder removed, and if there is calculus bovis (gallstones), it should be delivered to the state. The Yoro Code also includes provisions for the sale of the hides and meat of horses and cattle, and there were distribution channels throughout Japan for buying and selling these items during the Nara period.

=== Heian and Kamakura periods (794-1333) ===

During the Heian period (794 - 1185), the main use of cattle was for bullock carts. Cattle that excelled in this use were called &quot;sun-gyū&quot; (駿牛, swift bulls) and were regarded as excellent bulls. Owning such an excellent bull became a source of pride for the aristocrats of Japan at that time.

The &quot;Pictorial Record of Swift Bulls&quot; (駿牛絵詞) which is believed to have been written around 1279, is said to be the world&#x27;s oldest specialized book on bulls. In the same book, the names of 52 bulls are listed as swift bulls. At the time, the cattle from Iki Island in present-day Nagasaki Prefecture had the highest reputation as swift bulls, but they were temporarily destroyed by the Mongolian army during the Mongolian invasion, which killed them and used them as food.

From the Kamakura period (1185–1333) to the Muromachi period (1336–1573), farming using cattle and horses became popular mainly in western Japan, contributing greatly to the development of agriculture. In a complaint by a farmer in 1423, describing the wrongdoing of a manor administrator, it mentions that the farmer owned cattle and used them for farming.

=== Edo period (1603-1867) ===

Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, cattle were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and transport, and as a source of fertilizer. Milk consumption was unknown, and – for cultural and religious reasons – meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy.

Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of the intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time.

In western Japan during the Edo period (1603–1867), superior cattle were produced by aggressive inbreeding, and the superior bloodlines were called &quot;tsuru&quot; (, ), and cattle with superior bloodlines (&quot;tsuru-ushi&quot;, ) were traded at high prices. Famous &quot;tsuru&quot; include the Takenotani &quot;tsuru&quot; (Okayama Prefecture), Bokura &quot;tsuru&quot; (Shimane Prefecture), Iwakura &quot;tsuru&quot; (Hiroshima Prefecture), and &quot;Shusuke tsuru&quot; (Hyōgo Prefecture). In Japan, where meat eating was frowned upon and the use of milk was not widespread, cows in the Edo period were primarily work cattle that plowed the fields, so a good cow in this period meant one that was healthy and obedient.
The famous &quot;Tajiri-go&quot; bull was born from the &quot;Atsuta &quot;tsuru&quot;,&quot; which is a descendant of the Shusuke &quot;tsuru&quot;. According to a survey conducted by the Japan Wagyu Registry Association, the pedigree was traced from a database of 718,969 Japanese black cattle mothers registered in Japan, and it was found that 718,330 or 99.9% of them are descended from the Tajiri-go.

On the other hand, there are those who are concerned about the current situation in which only the Tajima cattle line represented by the Tajiri-go is spreading and genetic diversity is being lost from Wagyu, and the movement to revive the Takenotani &quot;tsuru&quot; has been attracting attention in recent years.

In 1859, Japan opened the port of Yokohama in accordance with the demands of Western nations. At the same time, a foreign settlement was established in Yokohama. Foreign residents sought cattle for meat from neighboring villages but were refused, so cattle were imported from the U.S., China, and Korea, which gradually became unable to meet the demand.

In 1865, before the Port of Kobe was opened, the Hyogo Port Opening Demand Incident occurred, in which nine warships from Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States invaded Hyogo Port demanding its opening. At that time, sailors negotiated with local cattle merchants for cattle, which were initially slaughtered on board, but as demand increased, it became necessary to slaughter them on land. 1866 saw the first slaughter of cattle by foreigners in the pine forests of Cape Wadamisaki. In this way, foreign ships bought 30 or 40 cows at a time in Kobe before the official opening of the port and brought them to Yokohama, where &quot;Kobe beef&quot; (actually Tajima beef) became well known for its delicious taste.

=== Modern times ===

In January 1868, when the new port of Kobe opened east of Hyogo Port, the Kobe foreign settlement was established. In 1868, Englishman Edward Charles Kirby established the first slaughterhouse in Kobe, and in 1869, a sukiyaki restaurant called &quot;Gekka-tei&quot; opened there.

According to a newspaper article in 1875, Kobe was the first place where meat eating was popular, with 800 cows slaughtered in a month. Next was Yokohama with 600, followed by Tokyo with 500, and Osaka and Nagoya with 300.

The reputation of Wagyu beef as having a superior taste spread from the residents of the foreign settlement to the Japanese, and it was written in books of the time that &quot;Wagyu beef has a better taste than foreign beef&quot; and &quot;there has never been beef as good as Kobe&#x27;s beef&quot;.

At the same time, however, it was also believed that Wagyu were superior to Western breeds for plowing use but inferior in milk and meat production, and their improvement was urgently needed.

Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some foreign cattle were imported. At first, there was little interest in cross-breeding these with the native stock, but from about 1900, it became widespread.

In 1900, the Japanese government established a committee to investigate the improvement of cattle breeding, and began a systematic crossbreeding program between Wagyu and Western breeds. The Ayrshire and Simmental breeds were imported first, followed by the Brown Swiss, but few people wanted to crossbreed with them because of their large size, and the Japanese government encouraged it, but the crossbreds were very unpopular. 

The crossbreds&#x27; oversized stature made them inconvenient for Japan&#x27;s narrow arable land, and their movements were slow and sluggish, and their temperaments were rough and lacking in obedience. They also had poor meat quality and were condemned from all quarters as being unsuitable for sukiyaki. As a result, from around 1907, there were no more crossbreds being bred, and in reaction, the old black cattle were considered good, and as long as they were small and black, they could be sold.

As crossbreeding with Western breeds progressed, the term &quot;pure Wagyu&quot; (, &quot;junsui Wagyū&quot;) emerged to describe native Japanese cattle, and by 1912, it was claimed that there were two definitions of Wagyu: &quot;pure Wagyu&quot; and &quot;improved Wagyu&quot; (, &quot;kairyō Wagyū&quot;).

At that time, Mendel&#x27;s laws had just been rediscovered, and both the Japanese government and cattle farmers lacked sufficient knowledge of genetics. The unpopularity of crossbred cattle led to the Japanese government&#x27;s decision in 1911 to suspend plans to purchase Brown Swiss and Simmental cattle. In 1912, the Japanese government decided to formally end its policy of encouraging crossbreeding by announcing that crossbreeding between Wagyu and European breeds had been sufficiently successful. From then on, Wagyu improvement was based on pure Wagyu and improved Wagyu (crossbred cattle).
In October 1912, when the 6th Chugoku Six Prefectures United Livestock Breeders&#x27; Show was held in Himeji City, Hyōgo Prefecture, two crossbred bulls won first prize as &quot;Improved Japanese Breed&quot; (改良和種, &quot;kairyō washu&quot;) and the term &quot;Improved Japanese Breed&quot; came into use thereafter. Thereafter, organized breeding efforts to increase the number of superior Wagyu cattle began.

According to a survey conducted in 1914, there were 61 different breeds of Wagyu in Japan at that time, including Tajima cattle, Iwaizumi cattle, Mishima cattle, Aso cattle, and others. However, these were not actual breeds, but only names of regional classifications.

In the case of Hyōgo Prefecture, the leading producer of Wagyu cattle (Kobe cattle and Tajima cattle) at that time, the number of stud bulls owned by breed as of 1914 was as follows.

Even after the Meiji era when hybrid cattle were encouraged, there were still a considerable number of pure Wagyu cattle remaining in the Taisho era (1912–1926). As a policy for the improvement of Wagyu, efforts were made to eliminate negative characteristics of hybrid cattle as much as possible. Specifically, the elimination of &quot;sudare&quot; (tiger stripes), &quot;nori-kuchi&quot; (grayish-white lips), &quot;unagi-sen&quot; (different fur color on the dorsal line), white spots, etc. On the other hand, efforts were made to improve the physique and weight of both pure and improved Wagyu cattle, and from around the 1920s, the term &quot;improved Wagyu&quot; came to refer to all Wagyu cattle, including not only improved Wagyu but also pure Wagyu.

Around 1919, the examination and registration of Wagyu began mainly in western Japan, and pedigrees and body types began to be registered. Nine breeds were registered: Tajima, Bisaku, Hiroshima, Bocho, Shimane, Inhaku, Bungo, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima. However, the examination and registration process was carried out by each prefecture, and the criteria for examination varied. Around 1925, the results of the improvements became visible: the negative characteristics of crossbreeding had almost disappeared from Wagyu cattle, their size and weight had increased, and improvements in hindquarters were clearly visible.
In 1937, when the former Japan Livestock Industry Association became the central organization for the registration of cattle throughout Japan, the breed names of &quot;Japanese Black,&quot; &quot;Japanese Polled,&quot; and &quot;Japanese Brown&quot; were created in place of the above nine breeds.
In 1944, it was officially decided to abolish the conventional name &quot;Improved Japanese Breed&quot; and call the breeds Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, and Japanese Polled, as the characteristics of each breed had been clarified as a result of improvements. This officially recognized the three crossbreeds as fixed breeds. Then, in 1957, the Japanese Shorthorn was added. They are collectively known as Wagyu.

The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from 1986 to 1994, which set rules for liberalization of international trade, decided to liberalize imports of foreign beef to Japan. Beef imports have been liberalized since 1991. In FY1993, beef imports jumped 34% over the previous year, and as a result, Japan&#x27;s beef self-sufficiency rate dropped below 50%.

The liberalization of beef imports has brought about changes in Japan&#x27;s domestic Wagyu beef production system. In order to compete with cheaper foreign beef, Japanese livestock farmers have become more focused on raising the Japanese Black breed, which has a unique marbling characteristic. As a result, the number of the other three Wagyu breeds has decreased.

Following the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Japan, the Law for Special Measures Concerning the Management and Relay of Information for Individual Identification of Cattle (Beef Traceability Law) was enacted in 2003. This law stipulates the attachment of ear tags to cattle, the notification, recording, and storage of historical information from birth to beef, and the publication of recorded information on the Internet. In other words, it is possible to trace the history of all Japanese beef sold in Japan.

== Breeds and brands ==
=== Breeds ===
==== Wagyu ====
Most of today&#x27;s Wagyu are improved Wagyu (, &quot;kairyō wagyū&quot;) that have been fixed as breeds through crossbreeding with foreign breeds. There are four breeds of improved Wagyu as follows:

* The Japanese Black (, &quot;kuroge washu&quot;), which constitutes over 97% of beef cattle in Japan; regional strains within the breed include the Tottori, Tajima, Shimane and Okayama.
* The Japanese Brown or Japanese Red (, &quot;akage washu&quot; or &quot;akaushi&quot;), the other main breed, representing about 5% of all beef cattle; reared in southern Japan, in Kōchi Prefecture on Shikoku island, and in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu island.
* The Japanese Polled (, &quot;mukaku washu&quot;), found principally in Yamaguchi Prefecture
* The Japanese Shorthorn (, &quot;nihon tankaku washu&quot;), reared in northern Japan, mainly in Iwate Prefecture; it constitutes less than one percent of all wagyu cattle.

==== Native Wagyu ====
Native Wagyu (, &quot;zairai wagyū&quot;) are cattle from ancient Japan that have not been crossbred with foreign breeds. It is also called &quot;Japanese breed,&quot; &quot;pure Japanese breed,&quot; &quot;pure Wagyu,&quot; etc. There are two breeds of native Wagyu as follows:

* Mishima cattle
* Kuchinoshima cattle

=== Brands ===
Today, each region in Japan has its own brand of Wagyu beef, numbering more than 320. The first Wagyu beef to gain a reputation was Kobe beef, already famous since the 1860s and known to foreign countries through foreign residents. Ōmi beef also had a reputation since the Meiji era (1868–1912) for its delicious taste. In the Taisho era (1912–1926), Matsusaka beef also became well known. These were originally Tajima cattle, and calves were purchased from the Tajima region, fattened in each region, and then sold. In the Tokyo area, Yonezawa beef has also been known since the Meiji era.

Since the 1980s, Wagyu beef branding has been promoted in various regions of Japan. However, the Japanese Trademark Law at the time did not allow for the establishment of regional collective trademarks, which posed a problem in terms of legal protection. Before the Beef Traceability Law (2003) was enacted, there were also issues regarding the verification of the origin, breeding location, and distribution of Wagyu beef.

In 2006, the Japanese Trademark Law was amended to recognize regional collective trademarks, allowing Wagyu beef to be registered as a &quot;regional brand.&quot; In 2014, the Geographical Indications Law was passed, and the operation of Geographical Indications (GI) protection began in 2015. Currently, the GI-registered brands of Wagyu beef are as follows.

* Tajima Beef: Tajima beef is beef from the Tajima region of Hyōgo Prefecture, and has a history of about 1,200 years.
* Kobe Beef: Kobe Beef is a brand given to the highest quality beef from Hyōgo Prefecture&#x27;s Tajima cattle and has a history of about 170 years.
* Special Matsusaka Beef: Special Matsuzaka Beef (Tokusan Matsusaka Ushi) is a brand given to the highest quality virgin female beef from the Matsuzaka region of Mie Prefecture. The Matsusaka beef brand has a history of about 100 years.
* Yonezawa Beef: Yonezawa Beef (Yonezawa Gyu) is beef from virgin Japanese black female cattle in the Okitama region of Yamagata Prefecture and has a history of about 150 years.
* Maesawa Beef: Maesawa Beef is a brand given to the highest quality beef from the Maesawa area of Iwate Prefecture, and has a history of about 70 years.
* Miyazaki Beef: Miyazaki Beef is a brand of wagyu beef from Miyazaki Prefecture, and has often won the Wagyu Olympics in recent years.
* Ōmi Beef: Ōmi Beef is a wagyu beef brand from Shiga Prefecture with a history of about 400 years.
* Kagoshima Black Beef: Kagoshima Black Beef (Kagoshima Kuroushi) is a wagyu beef brand from Kagoshima Prefecture that won the recent Wagyu Olympics.
* Kumamoto Red Beef: Kumamoto Red Beef (Kuamoto Akaushi) is a wagyu beef from Kumamoto Prefecture, characterized by its lean meat.
* Hiba Beef: Hiba Beef is a brand of Japanese black cattle from Shobara City, Hiroshima Prefecture, with a history dating back to the Edo period.
* Hida Beef: Hida Beef is a Japanese beef from Gifu Prefecture and has a history of about 100 years.
* Olive-Fed Wagyu Beef: Olive-Fed Wagyu Beef is a brand of Japanese black cattle that is fed olives. It is one of the rarest beef in the world.

== Characteristics of Wagyu beef ==

One of the primary characteristics of Wagyu beef is the fine marbling of fat within the red meat, referred to as &quot;sashi&quot;, and the high ratio of intramuscular fat. However, of the four Wagyu breeds, only the Japanese Black breed has this level of marbling, while the other three breeds do not have a high degree of marbling. The degree of marbling varies depending on sex, castration, and fattening method, but in the case of the Japanese Black, genes are thought to play a major role.

This characteristic of marbled meat is also found in the Mishima cattle, a native Wagyu breed. However, this characteristic is not seen in the Kuchinoshima cattle, which are also a native Wagyu breed. In addition, it is the Tajima cattle strain among the Japanese Black cattle that tend to have marbled meat, while the Takenotani &quot;tsuru&quot; strain in Okayama Prefecture, for example, is characterized by rather red meat.

The Japanese Black breed is known to be rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid). Generally, the melting point of beef fat is 40-50 degrees Celsius, but monounsaturated fatty acids have a lower melting point, so the melting point of Wagyu beef fat is below that of butter (around 30 degrees Celsius). Therefore, the fat melts at body temperature as soon as it is put in the mouth, and this is thought to be one of the main reasons for the tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture that is unique to Wagyu beef.

Wagyu beef, especially Japanese black beef, is known to have a unique sweet aroma called &quot;Wagyu beef aroma,&quot; which is thought to be caused by complex compounds such as lactones. Lactones, which are also found in peaches and coconuts, are more abundant in Wagyu beef, and their aroma increases when the beef is heated.

== Wagyu beef grades ==
Beef grades indicate the meat quality, and in Japan they are determined based on the &quot;Beef Carcass Trade Standards&quot; approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Two factors are used to determine the rating: the yield grade and the meat quality grade.

The yield grade has three levels: A, B, and C, with A being the highest. The meat quality grade has five levels: 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, with 5 being the highest.

Beef is graded in 15 combinations: A1 to A5, B1 to B5, and C1 to C5, with A5 representing the highest quality for both yield and meat quality.

The yield grade refers to the percentage of edible meat in the carcass. The meat quality grade is determined by four criteria: marbling, meat color, firmness and texture, and fat luster and quality.

== International Wagyu ==
International Wagyu is regulated and promoted through the World Wagyu Council. National Wagyu Day, also referred to as World Wagyu Day, is on June 21 to promote Wagyu by the World Wagyu Council. This day was founded in 2022 by Steve Haddadin and was adopted by the World Wagyu Council and British Wagyu Breeders Association as World Wagyu Day.

=== Australia ===

The Australian Wagyu Association is the largest breed association outside Japan. Both fullblood and Wagyu-cross cattle are farmed in Australia for domestic and overseas markets, including Taiwan, China, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the U.K., France, Germany, Denmark and the U.S. Australian Wagyu cattle are grain fed for the last 300–500 days of production. Wagyu bred in Western Australia&#x27;s Margaret River region often have red wine added to their feed as well.

=== United States ===
In the United States, some Japanese Wagyu cattle are cross-bred with American Angus stock. Meat from this cross-breed may be marketed as &quot;American-Style Kobe Beef&quot;, or &quot;Wangus&quot;, although many American retailers simply (inaccurately) refer to it as Wagyu. Wagyu were first competitively exhibited at the National Western Stock Show in 2012. Other U.S. Wagyu breeders have full-blooded animals directly descended from original Japanese bloodlines, that are registered through the American Wagyu Association.

=== Canada ===
Wagyu cattle farming in Canada appeared after 1991 when the Canadian Wagyu Association was formed. Wagyu style cattle and farms in Canada are located in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Canadian Wagyu beef products are exported to the US (including Hawaii), Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

===United Kingdom===
In 2008, a herd of Wagyu cattle was imported to North Yorkshire, first becoming available for consumption in 2011. Since 2011, there have been Wagyu herds in Scotland.
There are British &amp; Irish Wagyu Fullbloods registered through the British Wagyu Breeders Association.

===Brazil===

Brazilian Wagyu is regulated and promoted by the Brazilian Wagyu Association, a member of the World Wagyu Council.

===Germany===

German Wagyu is regulated and promoted by the German Wagyu Association, a member of the World Wagyu Council.

===South Africa===
South African Wagyu is regulated and promoted by the Wagyu Society of South Africa, a member of the World Wagyu Council.

===Namibia===
Namibian Wagyu is regulated and promoted by the Namibian Wagyu Society, a member of the World Wagyu Council.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand Wagyu is regulated and promoted by the New Zealand Wagyu Breeders, a member of the World Wagyu Council.

<text>Ceftriaxone, sold under the brand name Rocephin, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. These include middle ear infections, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease. It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection. Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle.
Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions. Other possible side effects include &quot;C. difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, gall bladder disease, and seizures. It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions. The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium. There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is a third-generation cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall.
Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical use ==
Ceftriaxone and other third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics. Due to emergent resistance, ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of &quot;Enterobacter&quot; infections. Before using ceftriaxone, it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria. If sepsis is being considered, empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing.

Medical uses include:
* lower respiratory tract infections
* acute bacterial otitis media
* skin and skin structure infections
* urinary tract infections
* uncomplicated gonorrhea
* pelvic inflammatory disease
* bacterial sepsis
* intra-abdominal infections
* meningitis
* surgical prophylaxis
* Lyme disease

Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci, meningococci, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;susceptible enteric Gram-negative rods, but not &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;.&quot;

In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin, ceftriaxone used to be recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. Due to increased risk of developing azithromycin resistant strains and the high efficacy of higher doses of ceftriaxone the guidance has been updated to mono-antibiotic therapy with a higher dose of ceftriaxone.

=== Spectrum of activity ===
Like other third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is active against &quot;Citrobacter&quot; spp., &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, and beta-lactamase-producing strains of &quot;Haemophilus&quot; and &quot;Neisseria&quot;. However, unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone, ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. It is generally not active against &quot;Enterobacter&quot; species, and its use should be avoided in the treatment of &quot;Enterobacter&quot; infections, even if the isolate appears susceptible, because of the emergence of resistance. Some organisms, such as &quot;Citrobacter&quot;, &quot;Providencia&quot;, and &quot;Serratia&quot;, have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases (enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive).
Although not being used as first line therapy against &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, ceftriaxone retains activity against isolates of methicillin-susceptible &quot;S. aureus&quot; and is used in clinic for infections sustained by this bacterium. In this case the dose should be doubled (e.g. 2 g intravenously every 12 hours).

=== Available forms ===
Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes. Ceftriaxone is stored as a dry powder in a vial, and is reconstituted (dissolved) immediately before use. The solution is used promptly after preparation, still, reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for 24 hours at 25°C (or for 3 days when stored between 2 and 8°C). The solutions are pale yellowish in color, but the change of color to amber or reddish suggests hydrolysis of the amide bond of the β-lactam ring, thereby affecting the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic. Diluents containing calcium are not used to reconstitute ceftriaxone, and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calcium-containing solutions, as a ceftriaxone-calcium precipitate could form. This precipitation risk is particularly high in newborns (up to age 28 days), especially if they are premature or have impaired bilirubin binding.

=== Specific populations ===

====Pregnancy====

Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B . It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies, but a lack of well-controlled studies done in pregnant women exists.

====Breastfeeding====

Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are &quot;not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants.&quot; The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed.

==== Newborns ====
Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone. It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

==== Elderly ====
According to the package insert, clinical studies did not
show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but &quot;greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.&quot;

== Adverse effects ==

Although generally well tolerated, the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts, local reactions at site of administration, rash, and diarrhea.

Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1%:
* Eosinophilia (6%)
* Thrombocytosis (5.1%)
* Elevations in liver enzymes (3.1–3.3%)
* Diarrhea (2.7%)
* Leukopenia (2.1%)
* Elevation in BUN (1.2%)
* Local reactions: pain, tenderness, irritation (1%)
* Rash (1.7%)

Some less frequently reported adverse events (incidence &lt; 1%) include phlebitis, itchiness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, elevations of bilirubin, elevations in creatinine, headache and dizziness.

Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile, causing biliary sludge, biliary pseudolithiasis, and gallstones, especially in children. Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects. Haemolysis is reported. It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children. Like other antibiotics, ceftriaxone use can result in &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. In this regard it has been reported that shifting from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime would have a lower impact on &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection rates, since cefotaxime is almost entirely excreted by the kidneys while ceftriaxone has a 45% biliary excretion 

===Contraindications===

Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation. Although there is negligible cross-reactivity between penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins, caution should still be used when using ceftriaxone in penicillin-sensitive patients. Caution should be used in people who have had previous severe penicillin allergies. It should not be used in hyperbilirubinemic neonates, particularly those who are premature because ceftriaxone is reported to displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites, potentially causing bilirubin encephalopathy. Concomitant use with intravenous calcium-containing solutions/products in neonates (≤28 days) is contraindicated even if administered through different infusion lines due to rare fatal cases of calcium-ceftriaxone precipitations in neonatal lungs and kidneys.

==Mechanism of action==

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation antibiotic from the cephalosporin family of antibiotics. It is within the β-lactam family of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone selectively and irreversibly inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to transpeptidases, also called transamidases, which are penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan polymers forming the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan cell wall is made up of pentapeptide units attached to a polysaccharide backbone with alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid. PBPs act on a terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety on a pentapeptide unit and catalyze the formation of a peptide bond between the penultimate D-alanine and a glycine unit on an adjacent peptidoglycan strand, releasing the terminal D-alanine unit in the process. The structure of ceftriaxone mimics the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety, and the PBP attacks the beta-lactam ring in ceftriaxone as if it were its normal D-alanyl-D-alanine substrate. The peptidoglycan cross-linking activity of PBPs is a construction and repair mechanism that normally helps to maintain bacterial cell wall integrity, so the inhibition of PBPs leads to damage and destruction of the cell wall and eventually to cell lysis.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Absorption: Ceftriaxone can be administered intravenously and intramuscularly, and the drug is completely absorbed. It is not available orally.

Distribution: Ceftriaxone penetrates tissues and body fluids well, including cerebrospinal fluid to treat central nervous system infections. Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins and the binding of ceftriaxone decreases with increasing concentration from a value of 95% at plasma concentrations less than 25 mcg/mL to 85% at plasma concentration of 300 mcg/mL. Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the apparent volume of distribution ranged from 5.8 to 13.5 L.

Metabolism: 33–67% of ceftriaxone is renally excreted as unchanged drug, but no dose adjustments are required in renal impairment with dosages up to 2 grams per day. The rest is excreted in the bile as unchanged drug which is ultimately excreted in feces as inactive compounds from hepatic and gut flora metabolism.

Elimination: The average elimination half-life in healthy adults is 5.8–8.7 (mean 6.5) hours, with some reviews estimated half-life is up to 10 hours. In people with renal impairment, the average elimination half-life increases to 11.4–15.7 hours.

== Chemistry ==

Ceftriaxone is commercially available as a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder for reconstitution. Reconstituted ceftriaxone injection solutions are light yellow- to amber-colored depending on how long the solution had been reconstituted, the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution, and the diluent used. To reduce pain with intramuscular injections, ceftriaxone may be reconstituted with lidocaine.

The &quot;syn&quot;-configuration of the methoxy oxime moiety confers resistance to beta-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The stability of this configuration results in increased activity of ceftriaxone against otherwise resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In place of the easily hydrolyzed acetyl group of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone has a metabolically stable moiety.

==Research==

Ceftriaxone has also been investigated for efficacy in preventing relapse to cocaine addiction.

Ceftriaxone seems to increase excitatory amino acid transporter-2 pump expression and activity in the central nervous system, so has a potential to reduce glutamatergic toxicity.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to have neuroprotective properties in a number of neurological disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite earlier negative results in the 1990s, a large clinical trial was undertaken in 2006 to test ceftriaxone in ALS patients, but was stopped early after it became clear that the results would not meet the predetermined criteria for efficacy.

<doc id="989193" wikidata="Q299029" url="?curid=989193" title="Wendy Fitzwilliam">
<text>Wendy Marcelle Fitzwilliam (born 4 October 1972) is a Trinidadian lawyer, actress, model, singer, tv host and beauty queen who won Miss Trinidad and Tobago Universe 1998 and became the second Miss Universe in history from Trinidad and Tobago. Miss Universe 1998 is also the third woman of African heritage to win the beauty pageant.

==Early life==
Fitzwilliam has one sibling, a younger sister, Dionyse Fitzwilliam. She grew up in Jade Gardens, Diamond Vale, Diego Martin and attended Diego Martin Girls R.C before attending St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent in Port of Spain. She also studied Law at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill.

==Miss Universe==
Fitzwilliam modeled for local fashion designer Meiling in her teenage and early years. She won Miss Universe Trinidad and Tobago. At age 25, she participated in the 1998 Miss Universe pageant held at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. She beat off challenges from the other semifinalists: Top 10 semifinalists Anna Malova of Russia, Andrea Roche of Ireland, Kerishnie Naicker of South Africa, Lymaraina D&#x27;Souza of India and Michella Marchi of Brazil, Top 5 finalists Silvia Ortiz of Colombia and Shawnae Jebbia of USA, eventual 2nd Runner-Up Joyce Giraud of Puerto Rico, and eventual 1st Runner-Up Veruska Ramírez of Venezuela.

Fitzwilliam&#x27;s regal air and perfect evening gown presentation won her the favor of the judges and made her the favorite to capture the crown that night. However, once the final 3 were announced, the final answer portion led people to suspense, since there was a deadlock between her and Ramirez of Venezuela who had won the swimsuit competition with the highest score ever seen at the time. Because there were eight members on the panel of judges and no way to break an eventual tie, the decision promised to be a nail-biter.

In the end, Fitzwilliam prevailed and became the first contestant in history to win wearing a bikini in the swimsuit competition, denying Ramírez that title as well. Her win came 21 years after another Trinidadian, Janelle Commissiong, who also happened to be the first Miss Universe of African heritage, captured in 1977 the crown for her country for the first time. Fitzwilliam is, thus, the second titleholder from Trinidad and Tobago and the third of African heritage, after Commissiong and biracial Chelsi Smith of the United States.

During her reign, she was honored by the United Nations and bestowed the title of UNAIDS and UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador for her work in HIV/AIDS education and awareness.

Her dedication to the HIV/AIDS cause also led her to found The Hibiscus Foundation (THF) in Trinidad and Tobago on 6 September 1998. This organization was established to heighten AIDS awareness in Trinidad and Tobago and to give assistance, financially and otherwise, to children&#x27;s homes in Trinidad.

She was the international spokesperson for Clear Essence Skin Care and made several notable television appearances having hosted segments of &quot;Wild On…&quot; for E! Entertainment Television and the Miss Universe Special for the same network.

She made appearances on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathy Lee&quot;, &quot;The Magic Hour&quot;, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, &quot;The O’Reilly Factor&quot;, CNN’s &quot;Talk Back Live&quot;, Trinidad and Tobago Carnival&quot; for BET, &quot;The Johnny Cockran Show&quot; on Court TV, Soca Monarch Finals for CNMG with Danny Glover and Chris Tucker, among others.

==After Miss Universe==
After her reign, she recorded a jazz demo and continued her education. In 2000, she was admitted into the bar.

Fitzwilliam has also acted as a judge and host for many regional and international pageants, such as Miss Guyana, Miss Trinidad and Tobago and Miss Universe.

She was the Vice President of Investment Promotion at the &quot;Evolving TecKnologies and Enterprise Development Company Limited&quot; (E TecK), a state-owned company in Trinidad and Tobago. She is also attached to the Trinidad Guardian&#x27;s &quot;Guardian in Education: Making a Difference&quot; project, a series of motivational school tours that also features former World Champion sprinter Ato Boldon and cyclist Michael Phillips, aiming to promote the development of the country&#x27;s diversity.

She was appointed the Red Cross Ambassador of Youth for the Caribbean.

Wendy is also referenced in the 2016 DJ Bravo Song &quot;Champion&quot;, which gained cult status following the victory of the West Indies cricket team in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 tournament.

She is one of the judges of the reality television competition &quot;Caribbean&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

In 2023, she was a guest judge of the &quot;71st edition&quot; of &quot;Miss Universe&quot;, held at the &quot;New Orleans Morial Convention Center&quot; in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.

==Personal life==

Fitzwilliam gave birth to her son, Ailan Andrew Panton in June 2006. She separated from his father, David K Panton, a Rhodes Scholar, CEO and former Senator in the Jamaican government, in 2008. She currently resides in her native Trinidad and Tobago with her son Ailan Panton.

<doc id="989194" wikidata="Q181359" url="?curid=989194" title="Talavera de la Reina">
<text>Talavera de la Reina () is a city and municipality of Spain, part of the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha. Its population of 83,303 makes it the second most populated municipality of the province of Toledo and the fourth largest in the region.

Although the city straddles both banks of the Tagus, a few kilometres downstream from the junction of the former with the Alberche, most of the urbanisation concentrates on the right (northern) bank. There are two islands in the centre of the city called Isla Grande and Chamelo Island. Three bridges cross the Tagus in Talavera.

The city is well known for its pottery craft. The Talavera de la Reina pottery was declared intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2019.

==Toponymy==
There are remnants of prehistoric cultures in the area. The village was founded by the Celts as a ford of the Tagus. The first mention of the city (with the name &quot;Aebura&quot;) occurs in Livy&#x27;s description of a battle between the Romans and the Carpetanoi, a Celtiberian tribe.

After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as &quot;Caesarobriga&quot;, one of many Celtic toponyms preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting &quot;fortified&quot; that was extended to many non-fortified towns: &quot;Caesarburg&quot;. Caesarobriga served as an important centre for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE. During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its Celtiberian name: &quot;Elbora&quot; or &quot;Ebora&quot;.

Its modern name is derived from &quot;Talabayra&quot;, the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name. The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under Alfonso VI of Castile in 1083.

==History==

=== Foundation===

Talavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers Alberche and Tagus. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area.

===Roman Empire and Visigothic Age===
During the time of the Roman Empire, the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of Emerita Augusta. The leader Viriato, in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE.

In this period, Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths established themselves in the city. Talavera was known then as &quot;Aküis&quot; or &quot;Aibura&quot;.

In the year 602, King Liuva II made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called Mondas, which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary.

===Middle ages===

The Muslims conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries. Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with Córdoba and Badajoz. Alfonso VI of León-Castile seized the city in 1083. The city was retaken temporarily by Muslims in 1109.

12th-century geographer Al-Idrisi reflects on Talavera describing it as a &quot;large town by the riverside of the Tagus&quot;, &quot;with a great number of watermills&quot; and &quot;surrounded of fertile fields&quot;.

The countryside of Talavera endured Almohad &quot;algara&quot;s in the early 1170s. Violence resumed after a truce in 1177, as answer to the simultaneous Castilian siege on Cuenca. In 1182, an Almohad army set up a camp near Talavera. Following the Almohad victory at Alarcos by Abu Yusuf Yaqub in 1195, Almohad forces ravaged the countryside of Talavera by 1197, yet apparently the well-fortified city (at least the citadel) stood still. Following the battle of Las Navas in 1212, the territory north of the Montes de Toledo became secure from Muslim incursions for good. Talaveran militias reportedly launched unsuccessful raids in Southern Iberia for the remaining of the 13th century.

The repopulation of the territory after the Christian conquest was led by Castilians, Franks and Mozarabs. Also a number of Moors from the south would increase the preexisting Muslim population of Talavera. Until 1290, Castilians and Mozarabs lived under the aegis of different law regimes. By the mid 13th century, Talavera and Plasencia sealed the creation of a brotherhood seeking to counter the territorial push southwards of the powerful &quot;concejo&quot; of Ávila.

Formerly a town, sometimes property of queens, such as Maria of Portugal, Talavera was transferred by Henry II of Castile on 25 June 1369 to Gómez Manrique (the transfer was confirmed in the 1371 Cortes of Toro), the Archbishop of Toledo, as payment for the latter&#x27;s support in the Castilian Civil War, and, since then, the town became attached to the Archbishops of Toledo.

The change from the &quot;concejo abierto&quot; towards a &quot;regimiento&quot; system of municipal government in Talavera should have happened by the second half of the 14th century. Unlike other locations the chief municipal public offices (&quot;regidurías&quot;) in Talavera were not subject to transfer from father to son, so the nobiliary elite relied in an alternative strategy to ensure its supremacy, based on a system that allowed them to control the candidates to the &quot;regidoría&quot;.

King Sancho IV gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year.

===Early Modern history===

By the late third of the 16th century the city reached a population of 10,000.

Upon the death of King Charles II in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown. Talavera supported Philip V&#x27;s French faction, which was the winner.

In the mid-18th century, by 1748, as part of the economic policies enforced by the Spanish Bourbons, the Royal Factory of Silk, Silver and Gold Fabric, was opened in the city, during the reign of Ferdinand VI.

The number of hidalgos reduced during the 18th century. The clergy retained an important socioeconomic importance. Towards the end of the century, a number of religious French emigrees would arrive to Talavera after the triumph of the Revolution. During the second half of the century, the bulk of the working population comprised the non-specialised workers and textile workers, ceramics workers (with a diminishing importance compared to previous centuries) and those dedicated to services, followed by the food industry, leather and the shoemaking sector.

=== 19th and 20th centuries===
The Peninsular War had great consequences for Talavera. On 27 and 28 July 1809 the Battle of Talavera took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French. The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army expelled the French from the city.
The manufacturing complex of the Royal Silk Factory closed towards 1851.

Talavera was granted the title of city (&quot;ciudad&quot;) in 1876.

Following the and the ensuing installment of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the local branch of the Patriotic Union (UP) formed in the city in March 1924 and the paramilitary Somatén in December 1924, during an event scheduled by Duchess of Talavera. A number of public events and demonstrations took place as part of the legitimization of the regime. The good connections of Mayor Justiniano López Brea with provincial and national officeholders fostered several projects of public works in the later part of the dictatorial period.

The railroad brought new opportunities for improvement. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo. The city had a population of 16,654 in 1936. The city had a population of 18,631 in 1940.

During the Francoist dictatorship the Instituto Nacional de Colonización promoted a large irrigated zone in the surroundings of Talavera, following which two new settlements were created, called Talavera la Nueva and Alberche del Caudillo, the latter located in the neighboring Calera y Chozas municipality. During the 1960s a &quot;baby boom&quot; caused an increase in the population, added to by the immigrants coming from the nearby villages and poor areas of Extremadura.

===Recent developments===

After Franco died in 1975, Talavera&#x27;s first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful. The succeeding mayor, Pablo Tello of the Socialist Party, made significant contributions, including the creation of Alameda Park.

In 1989, a sense of marginalization took hold of the city, prompting a group called &quot;Nosotros Talavera&quot; (We Talavera) to advocate for the establishment of a university campus and other initiatives to benefit the city. A Centre for University Studies was opened in the city in 1994. It was fully integrated as a campus of the University of Castile-La Mancha (UCLM) four years later, in 1998.

== Main sights ==
Rising over 192 metres, the , built in the outskirts of the city, was the highest bridge in Spain at the time of its completion. Given the enormous cost and limited use, it is considered a wasteful investment. Spanning over 318 m over the main channel of the Tagus, the cable-stayed bridge it is nonetheless one of the city&#x27;s most distinctive features.

===Pottery===

The city is internationally known for its ceramics, which Philip II of Spain used as tiled revetments in many of his works, such as the monastery of El Escorial. The nickname of Talavera de la Reina is &#x27;The City of Pottery&#x27; (&quot;La Ciudad de la Cerámica&quot;, in Spanish). Mexico&#x27;s famous Talavera pottery was named after the city.
==Transportation==

The city is located at the intersection of Autovía A-5 (part of European route E90) and N-502. Located on the route between Madrid and Badajoz, it has a railway station. Talavera de la Reina&#x27;s city bus system is Eborabus.

<doc id="989195" wikidata="Q2481447" url="?curid=989195" title="A-class submarine (1903)">
<text>The A-class was the Royal Navy&#x27;s first class of British-designed submarines. Thirteen were built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness between 1902 and 1905 as an improvement on the US . 

==Design and construction==
While there was considerable variation amongst the boats of the class, they were around long and displaced around 200 tons when submerged. The first, &quot;A1&quot; (ordered as &quot;Holland No. 6&quot;), was launched in July 1902, the last, &quot;A13&quot;, in April 1905.

===Propulsion===
All were propelled underwater by battery-powered electric motors and on the surface by shaft-drive Wolseley petrol engines of (&quot;A1&quot;), (&quot;A2-A4&quot;) or (&quot;A5&quot;-&quot;A12&quot;). &quot;A13&quot; had an experimental Vickers diesel engine, which proved to be unreliable.

===Armaments===
Armament was two torpedo tubes with four torpedoes except for &quot;A1&quot;, which had 1 tube and 3 torpedoes.

==Service history==
This submarine class was plagued by numerous accidents and failures; almost every boat in the class (&quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A3&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, &quot;A5&quot;, &quot;A7&quot;, and &quot;A8&quot;) was involved in some sort of accident over the course of their operational history. Many were fatal to the crew, and resulted in the decommissioning of the submarine. &quot;A1&quot; was sunk off Portsmouth on 18 March 1904, in collision with the liner &quot;Berwick Castle&quot;, but raised and put back into service before finally being sunk as a naval gunnery target in 1911, followed in 1912 by &quot;A3&quot;. &quot;A7&quot; was lost in Whitsand Bay in 1914 after diving into mud. &quot;A13&quot; was laid up in 1914 due to engine unreliability.

The remainder were used during World War I for harbour defence, &quot;A2&quot; and &quot;A4&quot;, &quot;A5&quot; and &quot;A6&quot; at Portsmouth, &quot;A8&quot; and &quot;A9&quot; at Devonport, and &quot;A10&quot;, &quot;A11&quot; and &quot;A12&quot; at Ardrossan. All survived the war and were converted to training in 1918 and sold in 1919–1920 except for &quot;A2&quot;, which was wrecked while awaiting disposal and finally sold in 1925.

<doc id="989196" wikidata="Q15521352" url="?curid=989196" title="Jeremiah Chase">
<text>Jeremiah Townley Chase (May 23, 1748 – May 11, 1828) was an American lawyer, jurist, and land speculator from Annapolis, Maryland. He served as a delegate for Maryland in the Continental Congress of 1783 and 1784, and for many years was chief justice of the state’s court of appeals.

==Early life ==
Chase was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Richard and Catherine Chase. When both his parents died in 1757 he was adopted by his uncle Reverend Thomas Chase, who was the Anglican rector of St. Paul&#x27;s parish in Annapolis. (St. Paul&#x27;s later became part of the American Episcopal Church.) His uncle also took over his education as he had done earlier for his own son, Samuel Chase.

When Jeremiah Chase was a young man, he followed his second cousin Samuel Chase to Annapolis. He read law in Samuel&#x27;s office and was admitted to the bar of Anne Arundel County in 1771. Chase established a practice in both Annapolis and Baltimore, which he continued in Annapolis until 1791 with interruptions for public service. He never went into practice with his cousin but they made several appearances in court for the same clients, and a few as opponents. There were several young men who studied law with both cousins, especially when one was out of town. This list of men included Roger B. Taney who was later Chief Justice of the United States.

He married Hester Baldwin on June 24, 1779.

==Political career ==
In 1773 Chase was elected to the Colonial House of Delegates. In 1774 he joined the prerevolutionary Maryland &quot;Committee of Correspondence&quot; for Baltimore and was elected to the revolutionary Annapolis Convention that created the state constitution of Maryland. In 1776 he attended the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention for Anne Arundel County. Under the new constitution he was elected to the House of Deputies in Baltimore from 1775 to 1777.

Chase&#x27;s adopted father, Rev. Chase, died in 1779 and after that Jeremiah moved fully to Annapolis. That same year he was named a member of Maryland&#x27;s Executive Council, which functioned as the upper house of the legislature, and he would serve there until 1783, and later from 1785 to 1788. Chase was also Mayor of Annapolis in 1783 and 1784. Those same years he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, which held sessions for those years in Annapolis. It was there he became a friend of David Howell of Rhode Island.

In 1788 Chase was a delegate to the Maryland convention called to ratify the United States Constitution. He was among those opposed to its adoption, believing that a Bill of Rights should be included. When the Bill of Rights was formally adopted by Congress in 1789, Chase generally became a supporter of the Federalist Party. He drafted the Northwest Ordinance of 1784 as part of its drafting committee.

Jeremiah Chase and his cousin, John Francis Mercer vehemently opposed the Federal Constitution&#x27;s ratification. Being elected to the state convention, he became an Antifederalist leader. Chase feared the Federalists would abolish state laws protecting personal rights, and he called for a federal bill of rights at the convention.

Having owned 11 slaves, by mid-1780s Chase was of the opinion Maryland&#x27;s slaves should be freed. At the 1788 state ratification convention he spoke against slavery being supported by a federal Constitution. He was one of 12 leaders who voted against the federal Constitution&#x27;s ratification.

==Judicial career ==
Chase returned to state politics after the constitutional crisis. Despite his opposition to the Constitution, Chase was named as a justice in the state&#x27;s General Court in 1789, serving for six years. He held the tax commissioner office of Anne Arundel County in 1788. As tax commissioner, together with Charles Ridgely and his cousin Samuel, he speculated in ex-Tory lands in Annapolis and the port of Baltimore. He also served in the Maryland State Senate in 1796, where he became a strong Republican in a Federalist state. In 1806 he was appointed chief justice of the Maryland Court of Appeals, for the third district, until 1826, retiring that year.

==Later life==
Jeremiah Chase remained married to Hester Baldwin until her death in 1823 and had five children: Richard, Frances, Hester, Matilda, and Catherine. He rented a wing of the Hammond House from Matthias Hammond as a law office. His residence was on nearby King George Street. In 1811 he purchased the Hammond-Harwood House for his eldest daughter Frances Lookcerman to live in with her husband Richard Loockerman. It was customary for the father-in-law to give the deed to his son-in-law. However, Judge Chase did not trust his son-in-law, and kept the deed in his name. When Chase died at home in Annapolis on May 11, 1828, he was buried in the &quot;City Cemetery&quot;, or St. Anne&#x27;s Cemetery in Annapolis. Some of his land was confiscated by the state from former Tories.

The Hammond-Harwood House still stands on Maryland Avenue at King George Street in Annapolis. The home is operated as a museum and is open to visitors. The museum interprets the Loockerman family living in the house.

<text>Scorpion is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. A ninja dressed in yellow, his primary weapon is a &quot;rope dart&quot;, which he uses to harpoon opponents. Since his debut in the original 1992 game, Scorpion has appeared as a playable character in every main installment except &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995).

The series&#x27; original Scorpion is Hanzo Hasashi (), an undead Japanese warrior principally defined by his quest to avenge the deaths of himself, his family, and his clan. After killing Bi-Han / Sub-Zero, whom he believed to be the killer, Hasashi develops a feud with Bi-Han&#x27;s younger brother and second Sub-Zero, Kuai Liang, that spans most of the franchise before discovering the sorcerer Quan Chi is the real murderer. While Hasashi has been depicted as a neutral figure focused primarily on seeking revenge, he will side with those who can help him achieve his goals. Following two reboots, Kuai Liang () becomes the new Scorpion in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), while alternate timeline variants of Hasashi make minor appearances. Scorpion has received critical acclaim since his debut and frequently appears in media outside of the games.

== Character creation ==
Scorpion appeared in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; as one of three palette-swapped ninja characters, along with Sub-Zero and Reptile. His early origins were revealed by the series&#x27; original chief character designer, John Tobias, in September 2011, when he posted several pages of old pre-production character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as &quot;[a] palette swap for 2 ninjas—a hunter and the hunted,&quot; while Tobias also considered the concepts of either one of them fleeing their clan or a &quot;revenge story&quot; involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans. In regards to the game&#x27;s strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon recalled: &quot;A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and so we knew that if we could take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we&#x27;d save a lot of money and we&#x27;d have two characters.&quot;

Scorpion yells one of two taunts — &quot;Get over here!&quot; and &quot;Come here!&quot; — at his opponents when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games and both feature films, but only one of them (&quot;Come here!&quot;) was included in the home ports of &quot;MK&quot; and &quot;MKII&quot; due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character&#x27;s phrases originated because he thought &quot;it would be funny to have him yell out &#x27;Get over here!&#x27; when he [threw the spear],&quot; and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts. Twenty years after the first &quot;MK&quot; game&#x27;s release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise&#x27;s history, adding: &quot;I remember people sitting in my office all day just doing this uppercut [on a speared enemy] again and again, like &#x27;Oh my God, that feels so good.&#x27; It just became the cornerstone of [the game].&quot; &quot;MKII&quot; saw the debut of the phrase &quot;Toasty!&quot;, which was voiced by series sound designer Dan Forden during a variation of Scorpion&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Skull&quot; Fatality or at random when any of the game&#x27;s characters landed an uppercut. According to Tobias, it first originated as &quot;You&#x27;re Toast!&quot;, which was a taunt bandied among the designers during game-testing sessions.

===Design===
Scorpion was given a yellow palette because the developers decided it symbolized fire in contrast to Sub-Zero&#x27;s ice blue. Their similar appearance but opposite nature &quot;prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan-type characters.&quot; A third ninja swap, Reptile, was added in the third revision as a hidden non-playable character who was outfitted in green and used Scorpion&#x27;s spear (along with Sub-Zero&#x27;s freeze) as part of his offensive arsenal; he was devised by Boon as &quot;a cooler version of Scorpion.&quot; The original costume was created from a modified ninja-like outfit bought at a Chicago costume shop and was red for filming in the first game, but a different yellow one with a quilted vest and knee-high shin guards was utilized for &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. This in turn made the other male ninja characters therein—Sub-Zero, Reptile, and hidden characters Smoke and Noob Saibot—palette swaps of Scorpion, with the latter two also using Scorpion&#x27;s spear when players fought them separately in secret battles. Scorpion and the ninja characters were first played by Daniel Pesina, who was replaced by John Turk for &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and the 1996 compilation &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, while Sal Divita played the character in &quot;MK: Mythologies&quot;.

While his ninja-outfit template from the first generation of games has remained relatively unchanged over time, the improved graphics of the post-&quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; three-dimensional releases have allowed more details to better differentiate the male ninja characters, and Scorpion&#x27;s costumes were duly enhanced with objects such as two katana swords strapped to his back and his spear attached to a rope tied to his belt in &quot;Deadly Alliance,&quot; and a set of ornate shoulder epaulets in &quot;Deception,&quot; in which his alternate costume was a throwback to the two-dimensional &quot;MK&quot; titles. Scorpion&#x27;s &quot;MK2011&quot; costume was inspired by his namesake, such as the character&#x27;s abdomen-shaped shoulder pads, the two stinger-handled swords crisscrossed on his back, and the exoskeletal pattern on his hard-shell face mask. Scorpion was included with Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Ermac in a bundle of classic costumes from the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; that was released as downloadable content for the 2011 reboot. For &quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot;, he received a new costume designed by comic artist Jim Lee. In the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s fighter-selection screen, Scorpion had regular human eyes, as his identity as a resurrected specter was meant to be a mystery, but he was given solid yellow or white eyes for every release thereafter starting with &quot;MKII&quot;, while actors portraying Scorpion in live-action media such as the feature films and the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; web series were outfitted with opaque contact lenses in order to achieve this effect.

===Gameplay===
Scorpion&#x27;s signature special move throughout the series has him hurling a harpoon-like spear attached to a length of rope at his opponents. The spear impales his opponents through the chest before Scorpion pulls them in to close range for a free hit. His other incumbent special move throughout the series, save for &quot;Deadly Alliance,&quot; has been his Teleport Punch, where he flies offscreen during battle and then reappears to strike his opponent from behind. Scorpion additionally gained a new leg-takedown maneuver in &quot;MKII&quot; that was not well-received (&quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; called it a &quot;ridiculous&quot; move that &quot;no one ever used&quot;). He was considered a lower-tier character by &quot;GamePro&quot; in their 1993 &quot;MKII&quot; character rankings, rating him eighth out of the game&#x27;s twelve playables and describing both him and Sub-Zero as &quot;formerly a top-tier character [who] doesn&#x27;t have much of a chance in &quot;MKII&quot; since all of the male ninjas have some poor matchups,&quot; with Scorpion faring the worst against Jax and Mileena. 

Ed Lomas of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; described the character as having &quot;simple yet effective&quot; special moves in &quot;UMK3&quot; that &quot;make him good for beginners, [which] doesn&#x27;t stop him from being a useful character,&quot; while his &quot;trusty&quot; spear was &quot;perfect for setting up combos.&quot; GameSpy, in their &quot;Deception&quot; walkthrough, described the character as &quot;a well-rounded character that has strengths in combos as well as in special and normal moves.&quot; They additionally described the spear as &quot;useful as ever&quot; in &quot;Armageddon&quot;, adding, &quot;Between [that and his] other special moves ... Scorpion pretty much has everything covered.&quot; Prima Games&#x27; &quot;MK2011&quot; strategy guide considered Scorpion to be well-balanced with no distinct weaknesses or advantages, while winning more than half of his fights against the game&#x27;s other characters. He is also a playable character for both the versus and story modes in &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;, where his move sets in this game are largely identical to Liu Kang&#x27;s with some original techniques.

Scorpion&#x27;s signature finishing move from the original game up until &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was his &quot;Fire Breath&quot; Fatality, in which he removed his ninja hood and face like a mask to reveal a skull right before immolating his opponent. A variation of this finisher was included in &quot;MKII&quot;: entering a different button/joystick combination added the spoken &quot;Toasty!&quot; phrase that simultaneously appeared on the screen. While the &quot;Fire Breath&quot; was brought back for &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; in 2008, his spear has otherwise served as his primary tool in his fatalities in the three-dimensional games, from impaling his opponents through the head and then decapitating them in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;, using it to yank off their limbs in &quot;Deception&quot;, and plunging it into their chest before kicking them through a portal that left nothing but a skinned corpse hanging from the spear&#x27;s chain in &quot;MK2011&quot; (&quot;Nether Gate&quot;). His second Fatality in the reboot, &quot;Split Decision&quot;, had Scorpion using one of his back-mounted swords to hack his opponent to pieces.

Scorpion would indirectly play a role in the fabrication of the then-nonexistent character Ermac when &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; published a doctored screenshot of Scorpion from the original game in 1993. This subsequently spawned false player rumors of a glitch that would turn Scorpion&#x27;s sprite red, with the name &quot;Error Macro&quot; appearing in the energy bar. Ermac became playable in &quot;UMK3,&quot; in which he was a red palette swap of Scorpion who shared his Teleport Punch.

==Appearances==
=== Midway games ===
First appearing in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), Scorpion is a warrior with a wife and child who was killed by the ninja Sub-Zero and becomes an undead specter to seek revenge by killing him in turn. In &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Scorpion believes Sub-Zero is alive until he realizes it is his younger brother, Kuai Liang, causing him to seek redemption. In &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, Emperor Shao Kahn enlists Scorpion&#x27;s aid, but the latter eventually defects to Earthrealm&#x27;s defenders due to his work pitting him against Kuai Liang.

Appearing as a boss in the prequel &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; (1997), Scorpion&#x27;s history is expanded on. Years prior, Hanzo Hasashi was a Shirai Ryu clan ninja who was enlisted by the sorcerer Quan Chi to find a map hidden in a Shaolin temple, unaware that the sorcerer also tasked Bi-Han of the rival Lin Kuei clan with the same task. During their subsequent fight, Bi-Han kills Hasashi, allowing Quan Chi to slaughter the Shirai Ryu and Hasashi&#x27;s wife Harumi and son Satoshi. Following this, Quan Chi resurrects Hasashi as Scorpion. Additionally, Scorpion appears as a boss in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005), which serves as an alternate take on &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and sees him attempting to kill Liu Kang and Kung Lao.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), Quan Chi sends Scorpion to kill Kuai Liang, only for Scorpion to learn the truth behind his clan and family&#x27;s deaths and drag Quan Chi to the Netherrealm. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002) and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), Scorpion loses Quan Chi, but escapes the Netherrealm, becomes a servant to the Elder Gods, and joins Earthrealm&#x27;s defenders in fighting the dragon king Onaga. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), Scorpion serves the Elder Gods in exchange for them resurrecting the Shirai Ryu and his family, only for the Elder Gods to turn them into undead beings. Enraged by this, Scorpion seeks the elemental Blaze&#x27;s power to destroy them, but is defeated by the protagonist Taven.

=== Netherrealm Studios games ===
In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Earthrealm defender Raiden tries to convince Scorpion to spare Bi-Han in exchange for the Elder Gods resurrecting the Shirai Ryu and his family, but Quan Chi provokes Scorpion into killing Bi-Han. This leads to Scorpion becoming a recurring enemy to the protagonists. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Scorpion continues to serve Quan Chi until Raiden and his allies restore his human form and free him from the necromancer&#x27;s control. Over the course of the following two decades, Scorpions reforms the Shirai Ryu and forms several alliances until he can kill Quan Chi and enact his true revenge. As of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), Kronika brings a past version of Scorpion to the present and recruits him, promising to resurrect his clan and family. Upon learning of this, Scorpion joins forces to oppose Kronika&#x27;s soldier. Hasashi convinces his younger self to defect to Earthrealm&#x27;s side but is killed by Kronika&#x27;s agent, D&#x27;Vorah. The past Scorpion agrees to help Earthrealm&#x27;s defenders stop Kronika in his stead.

Four incarnations of Scorpion appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, with &quot;Kuai Liang&quot; appearing as a playable character and via the story mode; Hasashi as an assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, and an alternate timeline variant via the &quot;Invasions&quot; mode; and a variant of Harumi, also via the &quot;Invasions&quot; mode. In the aforementioned story mode, Fire God Liu Kang creates a third new timeline, where Kuai Liang became Scorpion. After Bi-Han betrays them to join forces with Shang Tsung and learns Bi-Han allowed their father to die, Kuai Liang and Smoke leave the Lin Kuei and escape to Japan. There, they gain Harumi&#x27;s help in founding the Shirai Ryu clan and becoming Earthrealm&#x27;s new guardians. Additionally, Hasashi appears in Smoke&#x27;s ending, in which he is a young thief who the latter recruits into the Shirai Ryu. In the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC, Bi-Han leads an ambush on the Shirai Ryu during Kuai Liang&#x27;s marriage to Harumi, but they are able to fend them off after Scorpion reveals Bi-Han&#x27;s deception to Cyrax. He later works with Cyrax and Sektor to rescue Geras and Bi-Han from Titan Havik, discovering the latter had been transformed into Noob Saibot in the process. After Titan Havik&#x27;s defeat, Kuai Liang forgives Cyrax for her role in the wedding ambush and allows her to join the Shirai Ryu. In the &quot;Invasions&quot; mode, a variant of Hasashi / Scorpion travels across multiple timelines to find a living version of Harumi before Liu Kang sends him to one where he died and Harumi became Scorpion.

This version is a regular specter who wields a morning star. In the former, he seeks to solve all the riddles inside Shang Tsung&#x27;s mystical tome, the &quot;Tao Te Zhan&quot;, in order to gain absolute power. In the latter, Shao Kahn uses a mystical gem called the Deathstone to restore Scorpion&#x27;s human form and place him in charge of an undead army.

This version is a young man who acquires his powers after the soul of his deceased father merges with his body in the hopes of using it as a vessel to seek revenge against Sub-Zero for his murder.

===Film and television===

Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion makes minor appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; (1997), portrayed by Chris Casamassa in the former and J. J. Perry in the latter. This version works for Shang Tsung. Additionally, Scorpion makes a non-speaking appearance in the prequel, &quot;Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins&quot;.

Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; episode &quot;Sting of the Scorpion&quot;. This version is an independent entity who wields a length of chain tipped with a snake-like head.

An original, unidentified incarnation of Scorpion appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot; episode &quot;The Serpent and the Ice&quot;, portrayed again by Chris Casamassa. This version comes from the Great Kung Lao&#x27;s time period and was in a relationship with a woman named Peron. Additionally, he displays a rivalry with his time&#x27;s Sub-Zero, which stems from Peron killing the latter&#x27;s sister, leading to Sub-Zero killing Peron in turn.

Hanzo Hasashi appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot;, portrayed by Ian Anthony Dale. This version is a voluntary prisoner of the Deacon City Police Department.

Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, portrayed again by Ian Anthony Dale. In flashbacks, he was a family man who served as the Shirai Ryu&#x27;s leader and worked to train his son, Jubei. Additionally, he was a childhood friend of Bi-Han / Sub-Zero of the Lin Kuei clan before their mutual hatred towards each other&#x27;s clans drove them apart. Two decades later, their clans have formed a truce. Though Hasashi killed Bi-Han&#x27;s younger brother Kuai Liang off-screen, they attempted to maintain their truce until Quan Chi assumed Bi-Han&#x27;s form and killed Hasashi&#x27;s clan and family before killing Hasashi himself so the necromancer could resurrect him as his undead servant. Dale, who has a background in kung fu, said that after rehearsals, his &quot;arms and shoulders felt like they had daggers in them&quot;, while the contacts he wore were &quot;cumbersome&quot;.

Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, voiced by Patrick Seitz. After succeeding in killing Quan Chi and avenging his family in the former film, Scorpion chooses to die on Shang Tsung&#x27;s island. In the latter film, however, Scorpion finds himself in the Netherrealm, where fallen Elder God Shinnok confronts him for killing Quan Chi and tells him his soul contains the key to freeing Shinnok. Scorpion consults Raiden, who informs him of a powerful magical artifact called the Kamidogu. While looking for it, Scorpion forms an uneasy alliance with Kuai Liang / Sub-Zero before joining Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors in killing Shinnok.

Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada. Following his clan and most of his family&#x27;s deaths at Bi-Han&#x27;s hands, Hasashi tries to avenge them, but is killed as well. Nonetheless, Raiden rescues Hasashi&#x27;s daughter. Banished to the Netherrealm as a vengeful specter, Hasashi eventually returns in the present to aid his descendant Cole Young in defeating and killing Bi-Han. While he was initially unfamiliar with the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise, while conducting research on Scorpion, Sanada refers to him as &quot;a very tasty role for an actor: family man changed to fighting machine.&quot;

===Merchandise and promotion===
Along with the original series characters, Scorpion was highlighted on an individual track from The Immortals&#x27; album &quot;Mortal Kombat: The Album&quot; (1994), titled &quot;Lost Soul Bent on Revenge&quot;.

Scorpion has appeared in various types of merchandise during his tenure in the &quot;MK&quot; series, mostly action figures and sculptures. Hasbro released the first Scorpion figures in 1994: a 3.75&quot; version in which his mask was blue and he was packaged with a plastic scorpion accessory, then a twelve-inch figure whose design and packaged weaponry were more in line with the games. Toy Island distributed a Scorpion figure in 1996 as part of their &quot;MK Trilogy&quot; collection, which included a pair of hookswords, and Infinite Concepts put out a Scorpion figure in 1999. Jazwares released a 6&quot; &quot;Deception&quot; figure in 2005, and a 2006 &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot; figure that was also included as part of a Hot Topic-exclusive two-pack with Sub-Zero, in addition to a collection of figures in 2011: a 4&quot; figure from their &quot;MK2011&quot; line, a &quot;Klassic&quot; four-incher, and a &quot;Retro&quot; figure that featured an interchangeable skull head and was packaged with Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Smoke in a box set. Syco Collectibles released a host of Scorpion merchandise in 2011-2012: 10&quot; (with glow-in-the-dark eyes) and 18&quot; polystone statues, along with two busts—a 1:2 scale with a 15&quot; base and light-up eyes; and a smaller bust with an 11&quot; base that featured a detachable head. Pop Culture Shock distributed a life-sized bust in 2011 that featured removable shoulder pads and light-up eyes, as well as a 19&quot; statuette based on his &quot;UMK3&quot; design, as part of their &quot;Mortal Kombat Klassics&quot; collection. A 16.5&quot; mixed-media statue was released by the company in 2012, in which Scorpion was sculpted in a spear-throwing pose and was outfitted in all black.

Scorpion was one of thirteen &quot;MK2011&quot; characters depicted on life-sized standing cardboard cutouts from Advanced Graphics. Funko released a Scorpion bobblehead in 2011, and he was one of twenty characters featured on 2.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; collectible magnets by Ata-Boy Wholesale that year. He appeared along with other Mortal Kombat series villains, Kabal, Quan Chi, and Shao Kahn, in a collection of 2.5&quot; super-deformed figures released by Jazwares in 2012.

==Reception and legacy==
===Cultural impact===
Scorpion has made several cameo appearances in television programs, such as &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;. The character was featured along with Raiden, Ermac, Jax, and Shang Tsung in a 2014 animated short film produced by Comedy Central that parodied the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games.

===Critical reception and popularity===
Scorpion, along with Sub-Zero, is often regarded as one of the most popular and iconic characters in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise, and in the fighting-game genre in general. &quot;Game Informer&quot; rated Scorpion the third-best fighting game character in 2009, while UGO Networks ranked Scorpion second only to the series&#x27; main protagonist, Liu Kang, in their 2012 list of the top characters in the franchise. &quot;PLAY&quot; magazine ranked him fourth on their list of top ninja characters in 2013. Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked him as the seventh best fighting game character in the genre&#x27;s history due to the &quot;coolness of his &#x27;undead antagonist&#x27; factor. Despite the fact that he started out as a mere palette swap, Scorpion&#x27;s appeal made him a frontrunner in every major &quot;MK&quot; game to date.&quot; in addition to &quot;Complex&quot; naming him the fourth-&quot;most dominant&quot; fighting game character.

As Scorpion is regularly intertwined with Sub-Zero throughout the series, they have often been paired together in regards to the critical reception being praised by &quot;PC World&quot;, &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, and a &quot;GamesRadar&quot; article discussed their evolution across the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series, citing them as its two most popular characters. Together, Scorpion and Sub-Zero were voted the fifth most iconic characters in the two-decade history of the PlayStation by readers of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – UK&quot; in 2015. &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked ninjas from the series third best palette-swapped video game characters, adding that Midway Games &quot;has turned the art of making new characters from other, different-colored characters into a science.&quot; Scorpion&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Get over here!&quot; was listed in &quot;PLAY&quot;″s joke list of ten best chat-up lines. According to &quot;PlayStation Universe&quot; in 2011, Scorpion &quot;has spawned one of the most iconic catchphrases in gaming history&quot; and &quot;remains a firm fan favorite nineteen years since his debut.&quot;

Special moves and fatalities have been mostly well received. &quot;IGN&quot; regarded Scorpion&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Skull&quot; as the second-best &quot;MK&quot; Fatality without specifying any particular title in the series, due to how the player&#x27;s perception of the character changes when he removes his mask. They called it an &quot;enduring classic&quot;, noting that the finisher was notably unchanged in future games as a result of its connection with the character. His spear attack was ranked ninth in was called single most powerful yet balanced attack in the original game, as well as for its initial shock value, furthermore deeming it &quot;the definitive &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; move.&quot; The &quot;Nether Gate&quot; from &quot;MK2011&quot; was included by &quot;FHM&quot; on their list of the game&#x27;s nine most brutal Fatalities. His &quot;MKII&quot; Friendship, shared with Sub-Zero and Reptile, placed in Prima Games&#x27; list of the series&#x27; top 50 fatalities, in addition to the &quot;Nether Gate&quot;, his stage fatality from &quot;MK2011&quot;, and the &quot;Flaming Skull&quot; from the original &quot;MK&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; rated it the fourth-best Fatality from &quot;MK2011,&quot; in addition to rating the &quot;Flaming Skull&quot; as the third-best finisher from the first game. However, his Animality from &quot;UMK3/Trilogy&quot; (a penguin that lays an exploding egg) tied with that of Rain as the eighth worst finisher in the series according to &quot;GamePro&quot;.

&quot;The Escapist&quot; called the Scorpion and Sub-Zero-themed episode 7 &quot;one of the best episodes&quot; in the series, lending an emotional weight to the most famous tale in the franchise. On the other hand, Film School Rejects bemoaned the series&#x27; expectation that its viewers be knowledgeable about the franchise&#x27;s history, explaining that without previous knowledge of the games, the viewer is left with too many questions that may never be answered. Critical reception of Scorpion&#x27;s role in his spin-off was the subject of mixed commentary, as Alessandro Fillari of &quot;GameSpot&quot; as it excelled when it focused on Scorpion, but felt the character-heavy storyline &quot;makes for an overstuffed plot&quot;. Sam Stone of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised its development of the protagonist&#x27;s backstory, However, Bob Chipman of &quot;The Escapist&quot; opined that Scorpion&#x27;s was the film&#x27;s only grace, as he overshadows the rest of the cast of the film. Joshua Yehl of &quot;IGN&quot; commented, &quot;The movie’s biggest problem is that it tries to do the epic Mortal Kombat tournament arc on top of a more personal Scorpion story and ends up doing justice to neither.&quot; Meanwhile, Scorpion&#x27;s backstory from the 2021 live-action film was praised how violent it was without ruining the film. &quot;IGN&quot; in particular liked the handling of Scorpion and Sub-Zero&#x27;s rivalry across the movie&#x27;s fight scenes, &quot;Grim Dark Magazine&quot; agreed while also liking how the film properly cast Sanada and his rival for the roles, making them faithful to the original material.

<doc id="989200" wikidata="Q3328668" url="?curid=989200" title="Music of Djibouti">
<text>The Djiboutian Music (, ) refers to the musical styles, techniques and sounds of Djibouti. The first major form of modern Djiboutian music began in the mid-1940s, when Djibouti was a part of the French Somaliland. Djiboutian music is characterized by poetry, so that listening to a Djiboutian song is first paying attention to its meaning. The artist rocks the listeners in the cheerfulness of the refrains and the turn of the sentences. Often sung by a couple, a song is played in the form of a sleight of hand between a man and a woman, one recounting his feelings and his love, even his passion for the other, until the other accepts or rejects this offer.

The Djiboutian song is also distinguished by the &quot;Gouux&quot;, a deep and sensual voice which highlights the artist&#x27;s passion for his work.

==Overview==
Djibouti is a multiethnic country. The two largest ethnic groups are the Somali and the Afar. There are also a number of Arab, Ethiopian and European (French and Italian) residents. Traditional Afar music resembles the folk music of other parts of the Horn of Africa such as Ethiopia; it also contains elements of Arabic music. The history of Djibouti is recorded in the poetry and songs of its nomadic people and goes back thousands of years to a time when the peoples of Djibouti traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, India and China. Afar oral literature is also quite musical. It comes in many varieties, including songs for weddings, war, praise and boasting.
Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore. Most Somali songs are pentatonic; that is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Modern Djiboutian popular music can be traced back to the late 1940s, Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (), songwriters (), and singers ( or &quot;voice&quot;). Balwo is a Somali musical style centered on love themes that is popular in Djibouti.
The national anthem of Djibouti is &quot;Djibouti&quot;, adopted in 1977 with words by Aden Elmi and music by Abdi Robleh. &quot;Miniature poetry&quot;, invented by a truck driver named Abdi Deeqsi, is well known in Djibouti; these are short poems (&quot;balwo&quot;), mostly concerning love and passion. They perform music and dance from two of Djibouti&#x27;s main ethnic groups (Somali, Afar), they feature regularly on Djiboutian radio and television shows and perform as representatives of Djiboutian culture around the world. This festival draws performers from all over the country, and live recordings of headliner acts have proved popular with international audiences. Among the best-known performers are the Dinkara and Aïdarous. The government sponsors several organizations dedicated to the preservation of traditional culture and dance.

Djiboutian traditional instruments include the tanbura, bowl lyre and oud. It is often accompanied by small drums and a reed flute in the background.

== Music institutions ==
The first radio station in Djibouti to air popular Djiboutian music was (ORTF) Radio based in Djibouti. It started broadcasting in 1940 in French, Somali, Afar and Arabic. Djiboutian music is now regularly broadcast on the state-run Radio Television of Djibouti, whose in-house band is Groupe RTD.

<doc id="989202" wikidata="Q2006300" url="?curid=989202" title="Shinichi Watanabe">
<text>is a Japanese anime director and voice actor. He is best known for his over-the-top adaptation of Rikdo Koshi&#x27;s &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, in which he appears as the character Nabeshin.

Watanabe stated that the nickname Nabeshin (a name blending of &quot;nabe&quot; in Watanabe and &quot;shin&quot; in Shinichi) came to him from God.

About his unique appearance (dressing similar to the character Lupin III) Watanabe said he grew out his afro and started wearing bright clothing in order to stand out and get attention.

<text>Etolin Strait is a strait of the Pacific Ocean in western Alaska, the United States.

==Geography==
The strait connects Kuskokwim Bay and the Bering Sea, at . It is long and 48–80 km (30-50) miles wide. It is known for strong tidal currents.

It is between Nunivak Island to its west and Nelson Island and the Alaskan mainland to its east. It is demarcated by Cape Etolin to the northwest and Cape Corwin to the southwest (both on Nunivak Island), by Cape Vancouver on Nelson Island to the northeast, and by Cape Avinol on the Alaskan mainland to the southeast.

==History==
Etolin Strait is named after Adolf Etolin, who was the first European to discover it, and originally named it Cook Strait. Etolin was subsequently the colonial governor of Russian America from 1840 to 1845.</text><links>

<doc id="989207" wikidata="Q828414" url="?curid=989207" title="Anti-tank mine">
<text>An anti-tank or AT mine is a type of land mine designed to damage or destroy vehicles including tanks and armored fighting vehicles.

Compared to anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines typically have a much larger explosive charge, and a fuze designed to be triggered by vehicles or, in some cases, remotely or by tampering with the mine.

==History==

===First World War===
The first anti-tank mines were improvised during the First World War as a countermeasure against the first tanks introduced by the British towards the end of the war. Initially they were nothing more than a buried high-explosive shell or mortar bomb with its fuze upright. Later, purpose-built mines were developed, including the Flachmine 17, which was simply a wooden box packed with explosives and triggered either remotely or by a pressure fuze. By the end of the war, the Germans had developed row mining techniques, and mines accounted for 15% of U.S. tank casualties during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Third Battle of the Aisne, Battle of Selle and Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

===Inter-War Period===
The Soviet Union began developing mines in the early 1920s, and in 1924 produced its first anti-tank mine, the EZ mine. The mine, which was developed by Yegorov and Zelinskiy, had a 1 kg charge, which was enough to break the tracks of contemporary tanks. Meanwhile, in Germany, defeat spurred the development of anti-tank mines, with the first truly modern mine, the Tellermine 29, entering service in 1929. It was a disc-shaped device approximately 30 cm across filled with about 5 kg of high explosives. A second mine, the Tellermine 35 was developed in 1935. Anti-tank mines were used by both sides during the Spanish Civil War. Notably, Republican forces lifted mines placed by Nationalist forces and used them against the Nationalists. This spurred the development of anti-handling devices for anti-tank mines.

The Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland also saw widespread use of anti-tank mines. Finnish forces, facing a general shortage of anti-tank weapons, could exploit the predictable movements of motorized units imposed by difficult terrain and weather conditions.

===Second World War===

The German Tellermine was a purpose-built anti-tank mine first introduced in 1929. Some variants were of a rectangular shape, but in all cases the outer casing served only as container for the explosives and fuze, without being used to destructive effect (e.g. shrapnel). Tellermine was the prototypical anti-tank mine, with many elements of its design emulated by later mines such as the Pignone P-1, NR 25, and M6. Because of the Tellermine&#x27;s high operating pressure, a vehicle would need to pass directly overhead to detonate it. But since the tracks represent only about 20% of a tank&#x27;s width, the pressure fuze had a limited area of effect.

As one source has it: &quot;Since they were pressure-detonated, these early anti-tank mines typically did most of their damage to a tank&#x27;s treads, leaving its crew unharmed and its guns still operational but immobilised and vulnerable to aircraft and enemy anti-tank weapons ... During World War II they (the Wehrmacht) began using a mine with a tilt-rod fuze, a thin rod standing approximately two feet up from the center of the charge and nearly impossible to see after the mine had been buried. As a tank passed over the mine, the rod was pushed forward, causing the charge to detonate directly beneath it. The blast often killed the crew and sometimes exploded onboard ammunition. Now that tank crews were directly at risk, they were less likely to plow through a minefield.&quot;

Although other measures such as satchel charges, sticky bombs and bombs designed to magnetically adhere to tanks were developed, they do not fall within the category of land mines as they are not buried and detonated remotely or by pressure. The Hawkins mine was a British anti-tank device that could be employed as a mine laid on the road surface for a tank to run over setting off a crush fuze or thrown at the tank in which case a timer fuze was used.

Shaped charge devices like the Hohl-Sprung mine 4672 were also developed by Germany later in the war, although these did not see widespread use. The most advanced German anti-tank mine of the war was their minimal metal Topfmine.

In contrast to the &quot;dinner plate&quot; mines such as the German Tellermine were &quot;bar mines&quot; such as the German Riegel mine 43 and Italian B-2 mine. These were long mines designed to increase the probability of a vehicle triggering it, the B-2 consisted of multiple small shaped charge explosive charges along its length designed to ensure a mobility kill against enemy vehicles by destroying their tracks. This form of mine was the inspiration for the British L9 bar mine.

===Modern===

Several advances have been made in the development of modern anti-tank mines, including:
*more effective explosive payloads (different explosive compounds and shaped charge effects)
*use of non-ferrous materials making them harder to detect
*new methods of deployment (from aircraft or with artillery)
*more sophisticated fuzes (e.g. triggered by magnetic and seismic effects, which make a mine blast resistant, or which ignore the first target vehicle to drive over it and therefore can be used against convoys or mine rollers)
*sophisticated &quot;anti-handling&quot; devices to prevent or discourage tampering or removal.

==Design==
More modern anti-tank mines are usually more advanced than simple containers full of explosives detonated by remote or the vehicles pressure. The biggest advances were made in the following areas:
*Power of the explosives (explosives such as RDX).
*Shaped charges to increase the armour piercing effect.
*Advanced dispersal systems.
*More advanced or specific detonation triggers.

Most modern mine bodies or casings are made of plastic material to avoid easy detection. They feature combinations of pressure or magnetically activated detonators to ensure that they are only triggered by vehicles.

==Dispersal systems==
There are several systems for dispersing mines to quickly cover wide areas, as opposed to a soldier laying each one individually. These system can take the form of cluster bombs or be artillery fired. Cluster bombs contain several mines each, which could be a mixture of anti-personnel mines. When the cluster bomb reaches a preset altitude it disperses the mines over a wide area. Some anti-tank mines are designed to be fired by artillery, and arm themselves once they impact the target area.

==Off-route mines==

Off-route mines are designed to be effective when detonated next to a vehicle instead of underneath the vehicle. They are useful in cases where the ground or surface is not suitable for burying or concealing a mine. They normally employ a Misnay–Schardin shaped charge to fire a penetrating slug through the target armour. This self-forging projectile principle has been used for some French and Soviet off route mines and has earned infamy as an improvised explosive device (IED) technique in Israel and especially Iraq.
Due to the critical standoff necessary for penetration and the development of standoff neutralization technologies, shaped charge off-route mines using the Munroe effect are more rarely encountered, though the British/French/German ARGES mine with a tandem warhead is an example of one of the more successful.

The term &quot;off-route mine&quot; refers to purpose-designed and manufactured anti-tank mines. Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs) are one type of IED that was used in Iraq, but most &quot;home-made&quot; IEDs are not employed in this manner.

==Countermeasures==

The most effective countermeasure deployed against mine fields is mine clearing, using either explosive methods or mechanical methods. Explosive methods, such as the Giant Viper and the SADF Plofadder 160 AT, involve laying explosives across a minefield, either by propelling the charges across the field with rockets, or by dropping them from aircraft, and then detonating the explosive, clearing a path. Mechanical methods include plowing and pressure-forced detonation. In plowing, a specially designed plow attached to the front end of a heavily armored tank is used to push aside the earth and any mines embedded in it, clearing a path as wide as the pushing tank. In pressure-forced detonation, a heavily armored tank pushes a heavy spherical or cylindrical solid metal roller ahead of it, causing mines to detonate.

There are also several ways of making vehicles resistant to the effects of a mine detonation to reduce the chance of crew injury. In case of a mine&#x27;s blast effect, this can be done by absorbing the blast energy, deflecting it away from the vehicle hull or increasing the distance between the crew and the points where wheels touch the ground–where any detonations are likely to centre.
Another way to protect a vehicle from mines was to attach wooden planks to the sides of armored vehicles to prevent enemy soldiers from attaching magnetic mines. In the close combat on Iwo Jima, for example, some tanks were protected in this manner. A Japanese soldier running up from a concealed foxhole would not be able to stick a magnetic mine on the side of a tank encased in wood. A simple, and highly effective, technique to protect the occupants of a wheeled vehicle is to fill the tires with water. This will have the effect of absorbing and deflecting the mine&#x27;s blast energy. Steel plates between the cabin and the wheels can absorb the energy and their effectiveness is enhanced if they can be angled to deflect it away from the cabin. Increasing the distance between the wheels and passenger cabin, as is done on the South African Casspir personnel carrier, is an effective technique, although there are mobility and ease of driving problems with such a vehicle. A V-hull vehicle uses a wedge-shaped passenger cabin, with the thin edge of the wedge downwards, to divert blast energy away from occupants. Improvised measures such as sandbags in the vehicle floor or bulletproof vests placed on the floor may offer a small measure of protection against tiny mines.

Steel plates on the floor and sides and armoured glass will protect the occupants from fragments. Mounting seats from the sides or roof of the vehicle, rather than the floor, will help protect occupants from shocks transmitted through the structure of the vehicle and a four-point seat harness will minimise the chance of injury if the vehicle is flung onto its side or its roof–a mine may throw a vehicle 5 – 10 m from the detonation point. Police and military can use a robot to remove mines from an area.

==Combat use==

Anti-tank mines have played an important role in most wars fought since they were first used.
===Second World War===
Anti-tank mines played a major role on the Eastern Front, where they were used in huge quantities by Soviet troops. The most common included the TM-41, TM-44, TMSB, YAM-5, and AKS. In the Battle of Kursk, combat engineers laid 503,663 AT mines, achieving a density of 1500 mines per kilometer. This was four times greater than what was seen in the Battle of Moscow.

Furthermore, mobile detachments were tasked with laying more mines directly in the path of advancing enemy tanks. A January 1943 report on Russian anti-tank tactics by the American &quot;Intelligence Bulletin&quot; attributes the following to an unnamed Soviet intelligence officer: &quot;Each artillery battalion and, in some cases, each artillery battery, had a mobile reserve of 5 to 8 combat engineers equipped with 4 to 5 mines each. Their function was to mine unguarded tank approaches after the direction of the enemy attack had been definitely ascertained. These mines proved highly effective in stopping and even in destroying many enemy tanks.&quot;

The Wehrmacht also relied heavily on anti-tank mines to defend the Atlantic Wall, having planted six million mines of all types in Northern France alone. Mines were usually laid in staggered rows about 500 yards (460 meters) deep. Along with the anti-personnel types, there were various model of Tellermines, Topfmines, and Riegel mines. On the Western front, anti-tank mines were responsible for 20-22% of Allied tank losses. Since the majority of these mines were equipped with pressure fuzes (rather than tilt-rods), tanks were more often crippled than destroyed outright.

===Vietnam War===

During the Vietnam War, both &#x27;regular&#x27; NVA and Viet Cong forces used AT mines. These were of Soviet, Chinese or local manufacture. Anti-tank mines were also used extensively in Cambodia and along the Thai border, planted by Pol Pot&#x27;s Maoist guerrillas and the Vietnamese army, which invaded Cambodia in 1979 to topple the Khmer Rouge. Millions of these mines remain in the area, despite clearing efforts. It is estimated that they cause hundreds of deaths annually.

===Southern Africa===
Conflict in southern Africa since the 1960s have often involved Soviet, United States or South African supported irregular armies or fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare. Anti-tank mines were widely used in unconventional roles and spurred the development of effective mine-resistant vehicles. As a result, both Angola and Mozambique are littered with such devices to this day (as with Cambodia).

In the Angolan Civil War or South African Border War that covered vast sparsely populated area of southern Angola and northern Namibia, it was easy for small groups to infiltrate and mine roads, often escaping without ever being detected. The anti-tank mines were most often placed on public roads used by civilian and military vehicles and had a great psychological effect.

Mines were often laid in complex arrangements. One tactic was to lay multiple mines on top of each other to increase the blast effect. Another common tactic was to link together several mines placed within a few metres of each other, so that all would detonate when any one was triggered.

It was because of this threat that some of the first successful mine protected vehicles were developed by South African military and police forces. Chief amongst these were the Buffel and Casspir armoured personnel carriers and Ratel armoured fighting vehicle. They employed V-shaped hulls that deflected the blast force away from occupants. In most cases occupants survived anti-tank mine detonations with only minor injuries. The vehicles themselves could often be repaired by replacing the wheels or some drive train components that were designed to be modular and replaceable for exactly this reason.

Most countries involved in Middle Eastern peace keeping missions deploy modern developments of these vehicles like the RG-31 (Canada, United Arab Emirates, United States)
and RG-32 (Sweden).

<text>Nelson Island () is an island in the Bethel Census Area of southwestern Alaska. It is 42 miles (68 km) long and 20–35 miles (32–56 km) wide. With an area of 843 square miles (2,183 km2), it is the 15th largest island in the United States. It is separated from the Alaska mainland to its north by the Ningaluk River, to its east by the Kolavinarak River and from Nunivak Island to its southwest by the Etolin Strait.

Nelson Island has four permanent communities along its coast: 
* Tununak 
* Toksook Bay
* Nightmute
* Mertarvik

Umkumiut, a seasonally occupied is also located on the island.

A snowmobile trail connects the Tununak and Nightmute in the winter. These three communities comprise the entire population of the island at 1,065 inhabitants as of the 2000 census. The largest community is Toksook Bay. The rest of the island, over 77 percent of its area, is unpopulated.

The village of Newtok, on the mainland across the Ningaluk River north of the island, is in the process of being moved to Nelson Island, due to erosion of the water table in the area where Newtok is currently located.

The natives are Yupiit, who maintain a predominantly traditional diet, fishing and hunting musk ox and caribou.

==Etymology==
Nelson Island was named after Edward William Nelson, a Smithsonian Institution naturalist and ethnologist who studied the island and people there in 1878.

==Demographics==

Nelson Island reported on the 1930 and 1940 U.S. Censuses as an unincorporated area (which included 5 villages on the 1940 census, including Nevortolemute, Nigtmuit (Nightmute), Pngortalick, Tanunak (Tununak), and Ukak. It has not reported as a separate entity since.

<text>Chiemsee () is a freshwater lake in Bavaria, Germany, near Rosenheim. It is often called &quot;the Bavarian Sea&quot;. The rivers Tiroler Achen and Prien flow into the lake from the south, and the river Alz flows out towards the north. The Alz flows into the Inn which then merges with the Danube. The Chiemsee is divided into the bigger, north section, in the northeast, called , and the , in the southwest.

The Chiemgau, the region surrounding the Chiemsee, is a popular recreation area.


At the bottom of the lake, there is a double meteor crater.

== Origin ==
The Chiemsee was formed, like many other pre-alpine lakes, at the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago from a hollow carved out by a glacier (a ). Originally the lake covered an area of almost , which is about three times its present area. Within 10,000 years its area had shrunk to around . Before 1904 the water level was lowered by about a metre. As a result, large areas of dry land were reclaimed.

==Islands==
There are three main islands on the lake: Herreninsel (&quot;gentlemen&#x27;s island&quot;), the largest, with an area of ; Frauenchiemsee, , also called &quot;Fraueninsel&quot; (&quot;ladies&#x27; island&quot;); and the uninhabited Krautinsel (&quot;cabbage island&quot;), , called by this name because in the Middle Ages it was cultivated with cabbages and other vegetables.
*Herreninsel has a palace built by King Ludwig II in 1878 called , which was never completed but was meant to be a replica of the Palace of Versailles. Many of its rooms are open to tourists; tours of the palace and its extensive grounds are conducted throughout the summer.
*Frauenchiemsee, the smaller of the two main islands, houses a Benedictine nunnery, built in 782, as well as a small village. The nuns make a liquor called (&quot;cloister liquor&quot;) and marzipan (almond paste).

The smallest island in the lake is the west of Frauenchiemsee, which is of square outline, with a side length of only or an area of . This tiny island had probably been created artificially to mark a shallow spot for sailboats. There is a willow on the island, originally planted in 1935, and replaced by a young tree in the 2000s.

==AFRC Lake Hotel==
On 1 September 1938 the first Autobahn rest house opened on the A8 on the outskirts of Bernau am Chiemsee on the lake’s southern shore. From 1945 until 2 September 2003 the building served as an Armed Forces Recreation Center for the US military, called the Lake Hotel. The building is now an orthopaedic clinic.

<doc id="989222" wikidata="Q11627064" url="?curid=989222" title="Music of Western Sahara">
<text>The inhabitants of the Western Sahara have created both traditional as well as modern music styles. Sahrawi music shares much in common with neighbouring musical traditions, such as those of Mauritania and southern Morocco, and retains aspects of pre-colonial heritage. 

The &quot;tbal&quot; is the basic percussion instrument, while the traditional string instrument called &quot;Tidinit,&quot; has largely been replaced by the electric guitar. Some performers are tribespeople who lived a nomadic existence before the Western Sahara War against Morocco between 1975 and 1991, which was true of the family of Mariem Hassan.

The first Sahrawi music album, titled &quot;Polisario vencerá&quot;, was recorded live in Barcelona, in 1982 by the band Shahid El Uali. From 1998, Nubenegra (a Spanish music label) marketed several Sahrawi music CDs in the United States and Germany, with a first release of a three-disc box titled &quot;&quot;. Featured artists in the compilation were singers Mariem Hassan and Aziza Brahim, Leyoad, and guitarist Nayim Alal. In 2000, American label Rounder Records released their own compilation &quot;Starry Nights in Western Sahara&quot;. In 2003 Nubenegra edited the album &quot;Nar&quot; (&quot;Fire&quot;) from guitarist and singer Nayim Alal.

In 2002 Mariem Hassan and Leyoad released a collaboration album, &quot;Mariem Hassan con Leyoad&quot;. Then, in 2005 Nubenegra edited Mariem Hassan&#x27;s first solo album, titled &quot;Deseos&quot; (&quot;Wishes&quot;). In 2009, her album &quot;Shouka&quot; (&quot;Thorn&quot;) was published. Her last work, &quot;El Aaiun egdat&quot; (&quot;El Aaiun on fire&quot;) was released in 2012.

On November 8, 2007 Tiris released the album &quot;Sandtracks&quot; on British label Sandblast Records. In 2007, the American label Sublime Frequencies edited the album &quot;Guitar Music from Western Sahara&quot;, from the Dakhla-based band Group Doueh. In June 2009, Group Doueh released the album &quot;Treeg Salaam&quot; (&quot;Streets of Peace&quot;).

In 2008, Aziza Brahim released her first EP with the French label Reaktion, titled &quot;Mi Canto&quot; (&quot;My Singing&quot;). Her LP &quot;Mabruk&quot; with her band Gulili Mankoo was scheduled for June 2012.

Some Sahrawi musicians have settled in Dakar, where they have played with musicians from West Africa.

<doc id="989223" wikidata="Q967977" url="?curid=989223" title="United States Porpoise-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Porpoise&quot; class were submarines built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s, and incorporated a number of modern features that would make them the basis for the subsequent , , , , , and classes. In some references, the &quot;Porpoise&quot;s are called the &quot;P&quot; class.

==Design==
The four submarines of the &quot;Porpoise&quot; and &quot;Shark&quot; groups were authorized for construction in Fiscal Year 1934. The two submarines of the &quot;Porpoise&quot; group were developed by the Bureau of Construction &amp; Repair at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. It was a full double hull design that was essentially an enlarged &quot;Cachalot&quot; (SS-170). The two submarines of the &quot;Shark&quot; group were developed by Electric Boat and they were built to a partial double hull design with single hull ends, a refinement of an earlier hull type used on the &quot;Dolphin&quot; (SS-169). Six submarines of the &quot;Perch&quot; group were authorized for construction in Fiscal Year 1935. The Navy thought the Electric Boat design to be the better of the two, so all six boats were built to the partial double hull pioneered by Electric Boat. All ten submarines carried the same armament and propulsion machinery, and had the same operating characteristics and thus were considered to be the same class.

The five boats of this class built at the government owned Portsmouth Navy Yard and Mare Island Navy Yard were the last submarines in the USN to be built to a riveted construction method. While welding was used in non-critical areas, riveting was still used on the inner and outer hulls. Design conservatism and the economic realities of the Great Depression drove this decision by Portsmouth. The five boats built by Electric Boat were the first all welded submarines in the USN. All submarines built for the USN after this class by all yards were of all-welded construction.
In general, they were around long and diesel-electric powered. Displacement was 1,934 tons submerged for the first four boats, 1,998 tons for the later ones.

The goal of a 21-knot fleet submarine that could keep up with the standard-type battleships was still elusive. The relatively high surfaced speed of was primarily to improve reliability at lower cruising speeds. A major improvement essential in a Pacific war was an increase in range from &quot;Perch&quot; onwards, nearly doubling from to at . This allowed extended patrols in Japanese home waters, and would remain standard through the &quot;Tench&quot; class of 1944.

Although it proved successful with improved equipment beginning with the &quot;Tambor&quot; class of 1940, the diesel-electric drive was troublesome at first. In this arrangement, the boat&#x27;s four main diesel engines drove only electric generators, which supplied power to high-speed electric motors geared to the propeller shafts. The engines themselves were not connected to the propeller shafts. For submerged propulsion, massive storage batteries supplied electricity to the motors. Problems arose with flashover and arcing in the main electric motors. There was also a loss of in transmission through the electrical system. The Winton Model 16-201A 16-cylinder diesels also proved problematic, and were eventually replaced with 12-278As. &quot;Pompano&quot; would be the sole boat of the class fitted with the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler Model 89DA, an innovative double acting diesel engine. Unfortunately, these engines gave &quot;Pompano&quot; considerable trouble due to excessive vibration and improperly forged gearing. A lack of funding for replacements forced the Navy to nurse the engines along until they could be replaced with Fairbanks-Morse 38A8 units in 1942.

Five of the class received an additional pair of external bow torpedo tubes, probably early in World War II: &quot;Porpoise&quot;, &quot;Pike&quot;, &quot;Tarpon&quot;, &quot;Pickerel&quot;, and &quot;Permit&quot;. The original Mark 6 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was eventually replaced during the war by the Mark 21 model. The new gun provided a nominal anti-aircraft capability because it allowed high elevations, although this capability was rarely used in combat. &quot;Plunger&quot; received a Mark 9 4 inch (102 mm)/50 caliber gun during an overhaul in 1943. The boats also originally carried two water jacketed M2 Browning .50 caliber machine guns, with one mounted on the &quot;cigarette deck&quot; on the aft end of the conning tower fairwater and one on a mount on the main deck forward. These guns were taken below when the boat submerged.

These boats were all built with a large bulky conning tower fairwater with an enclosed (but free-flooding) wheelhouse and a surface steering station at the forward end. Two periscopes were fitted, one that let into the control room and one that let into the conning tower. The original 30 foot periscopes proved to be too short and were later replaced with 34 foot models.

==Boats in class==
The &quot;Porpoise&quot; class consisted of the &quot;Porpoise&quot; group, the &quot;Shark&quot; group, and the &quot;Perch&quot; group subclasses:



==Service==
Following participation in exercises from 1937, all but three of the ten &quot;Porpoise&quot; class were forward deployed to the Philippines in late 1939. In October 1941 most of the front-line submarine force, including all sixteen &quot;Salmon&quot; and &quot;Sargo&quot; class boats, joined them. The Japanese occupation of southern Indo-China and the August 1941 American-British-Dutch retaliatory oil embargo had raised international tensions, and an increased military presence in the Philippines was felt necessary. The Japanese did not bomb the Philippines until 10 December 1941, so almost all of the submarines were able to get underway prior to the attack.

War experience showed that the boats were not optimized for combat. Armament needed to be upgraded and new technologies needed to be implemented. The conning tower fairwater in particular was deemed a liability as it was too large and easily sighted by the Japanese while surfaced. The Navy immediately authorized modification programs to address these issues. The conning tower fairwater was reduced in size in a fashion similar to the other fleet submarines, with both the forward and after sections cut away. This gave the fairwater a smaller, stepped appearance. Reducing the size of the fairwater also provided new platforms for mounting heavier machine guns, with two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons being mounted. An SD air search radar was mounted on an extendable mast on the forward edge of the conning tower fairwater, and an SJ surface search radar was added on a short mast on the bridge itself. As noted above the torpedo armament was upgraded on five of the boats, and improved engines were installed.

Two of the class were lost in Southeast Asian waters in early 1942, and another two were lost near Japan in 1943. By early 1945, all six surviving boats had been transferred to New London, Connecticut for training duties. Of these, four were used postwar as decommissioned reserve training submarines until they were scrapped in 1957.

<doc id="989234" wikidata="Q7733507" url="?curid=989234" title="The Fat Controller">
<text>The Fat Controller is a fictional character in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; books written by Reverend W. Awdry and his son, Christopher Awdry. In the first two books in the series (&quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot; and &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;) he is known as The Fat Director, and as of the third book (&quot;James the Red Engine&quot;) he becomes The Fat Controller, as the railway has been nationalised. In the foreword to the 1951 book &quot;Henry the Green Engine&quot;, his real name is revealed to be Sir Topham Hatt.

The Fat Controller also appears in the television series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, adapted from the books. On television, he was usually portrayed in the form of several different static figures made with either wood or lead during series one, and resin from series two onwards, but has been portrayed using CGI from the twelfth series onward.

The term &quot;fat controller&quot; has since been adopted in various contexts in the English language, beyond the sphere of the original stories, usually in reference to someone who runs a railway.

==Origin of nickname==
The character is first seen in &quot;The Sad Story of Henry&quot; in the first book in the &quot;Railway Series&quot;, &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;. When Henry refused to leave a tunnel, the story says that &quot;A fat director, who was on the train, told the guard to get a rope&quot;. The character is referred to as The Fat Controller from the third book, &quot;James the Red Engine,&quot; for the remainder of the &quot;Railway Series,&quot; due to the nationalisation of British Railways. The name Sir Topham Hatt is first mentioned in the foreword to &quot;Henry the Green Engine&quot; and also appears on his luggage trunk in the same book in the story &quot;Percy and the Trousers&quot;. The first use of the name Sir Topham Hatt in the TV series comes in the episode &#x27;The Sad Story of Henry&#x27; when the narrator (Ringo Starr in both UK version and the first US version and George Carlin in the second US version) introduces him to the audience.

==In real life==
&quot;Day Out with Thomas&quot; events are a popular way of raising money for heritage railways. These events are an opportunity for children to meet characters from the books and television series (or at least, engines that have been &quot;dressed up&quot; to resemble them). These events are invariably presided over by a Fat Controller, played by a railway volunteer of appropriate age and build. The copyright holders are strict about how these volunteers should appear: the South Devon Railway&#x27;s Fat Controller was forced to either quit or shave off his beard, and it is absolutely forbidden for a Fat Controller to be too thin. In the United States, on the other hand, he is instead portrayed as a costumed character (with the performer&#x27;s face hidden).

<text>Tabassum Fatima Hashmi (born 4 November 1971), known professionally as Tabu, is an Indian actress who works primarily in Hindi films. Regarded as one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s most accomplished actresses, she has also worked in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, English, Bengali and Marathi films. She has often played troubled women, from fictional to literary, in both mainstream and independent cinema. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two National Film Awards, seven Filmfare Awards (including a record five Critics Awards for Best Actress), and two Filmfare Awards South. In 2011, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian honour.

Tabu had her first credited role as a teenager in Dev Anand&#x27;s &quot;Hum Naujawan&quot; (1985) and played her first leading role in the Telugu film &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (1991). In 1994, she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for the Hindi action drama &quot;Vijaypath&quot;. She won the National Film Award for Best Actress for playing a young woman affected by the Punjab insurgency in the political thriller &quot;Maachis&quot; (1996). Also in 1996, she had commercial successes in &quot;Ninne Pelladata&quot;, &quot;Kadhal Desam&quot;, &quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot; and &quot;Jeet&quot;. Further box-office hits came with the dramas &quot;Iruvar&quot;, &quot;Border&quot; (both 1997), &quot;Biwi No.1&quot;, &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Kandukondain Kandukondain&quot;, and &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; (both 2000).

Tabu gained acclaim for portraying troubled women in &quot;Virasat&quot; (1997), &quot;Hu Tu Tu&quot; (1999), and &quot;Astitva&quot; (2000), all of which won her Filmfare Critics Awards; and as a bar dancer in &quot;Chandni Bar&quot; (2001) which earned her a second National Film Award. This acclaim continued with her roles in the romantic comedy &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; (2007) which earned her a record fourth Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Vishal Bhardwaj-directed Shakespearean tragedies—&quot;Maqbool&quot; (2004) and &quot;Haider&quot; (2014), the latter earning her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Tabu expanded to American cinema with &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2006) and &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012). Her biggest commercial successes in India came with the comedies &quot;Golmaal Again&quot; (2017), &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2&quot; (2022)—for which she earned the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics)—and &quot;Crew&quot; (2024), the action drama &quot;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&quot; (2020), and the crime thrillers &quot;Andhadhun&quot; (2018) and &quot;Drishyam 2&quot; (2022).

== Early and personal life ==
Tabassum Fatima Hashmi was born on 4 November 1971 to Jamal Ali Hashmi and Rizwana in a Hyderabadi Muslim family. Her father was an actor in Pakistan, with some well-received roles in the 1970s, who moved back to India in order to live with her mother. He left the family when she was three. She has an older sister, Farah, who is also an actor. Her mother was a school-teacher and her maternal grandparents were retired professors who ran a school. Her grandfather, Mohammed Ahsan, was a professor of mathematics, and her grandmother was a professor of English Literature.

Tabu did her schooling at St. Ann&#x27;s High School, Vijayanagar Colony, Hyderabad. She moved to Mumbai in 1983 and studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s College for 2 years. She is the niece of Shabana Azmi, Tanvi Azmi and Baba Azmi. She is reluctant to discuss her familial life in the media.

As a child, Tabu had an uncredited appearance at the age of 11 in &quot;Bazaar&quot; (1982) and in &quot;Hum Naujawan&quot; (1985) at the age of 14—she played Dev Anand&#x27;s daughter in the latter.

Tabu&#x27;s personal life has been subject to substantial media speculation due to her decision to remain unmarried unlike most of her contemporaries and has remained reticent when asked about her choice. When asked about her decision, Tabu said she &quot;was working and wanted to see the world on my own. If I&#x27;d given it all up, it&#x27;d have been a disservice to me and my abilities. An ideal relationship is when both individuals grow by being in each other&#x27;s lives. Relationships are meant to liberate, not stifle&quot;.

==Career==
=== Debut and breakthrough (1991–1999) ===
In 1987, producer Boney Kapoor launched two major films; &quot;Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja&quot; and &quot;Prem,&quot; in which Tabu was signed opposite Sanjay Kapoor, Boney&#x27;s younger brother. Tabu debuted into Telugu cinema with &quot;Coolie No.1&quot; (1991) co-starring Venkatesh. The film proved to be a major box-office success.

Tabu&#x27;s first release in Hindi as a leading lady was in the romantic drama &quot;Pehla Pehla Pyar&quot; (1994), which generally went unnoticed. However, a turning point in her career came with action film &quot;Vijaypath&quot; (1994) opposite Ajay Devgn, for which she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. The film marked the first of many collaborations with Devgn. In the following year, significant appearances for Tabu included her role in the box-office success &quot;Haqeeqat&quot; and the romantic drama film &quot;Saajan Ki Baahon Mein&quot; alongside Rishi Kapoor and Raveena Tandon.

In 1996, Tabu had eight releases, two of which—&quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot; and &quot;Jeet—&quot;emerged as commercial successes and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of that year.&quot;&quot; For the latter, she received her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was also seen in Gulzar&#x27;s critically acclaimed political thriller &quot;Maachis&quot; opposite Chandrachur Singh. Her role as a Punjabi woman caught in the rise of Sikh insurgency earned unanimous critical claim; she earned her first National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance, in addition to her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Tabu considered the film a turning point in her career, as it helped her recognise her potential as an actress despite her initial hesitation in accepting the role due to its serious subject matter. She followed this with a role opposite Nagarjuna in &quot;Ninne Pelladutha&quot; (1996), the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time of its release. For her performance, she earned her first Filmfare award for Best Actress – Telugu. Anupama Chopra described her as &quot;breathtakingly sensuous&quot;. This acclaim continued with the Malayalam period epic &quot;Kaalapani&quot;, directed by Priyadarshan. She also made her debut in Tamil cinema with the successful romantic-drama &quot;Kadhal Desam&quot;, directed by Kathir.

Tabu&#x27;s first release of 1997 was the J. P. Dutta-helmed &quot;Border&quot;, an ensemble war drama that retells the real-life events surrounding the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pak War of 1971; she played the role of Sunny Deol&#x27;s wife. Though her role in the film was brief, it went on to be the second highest-grossing Indian film of 1997. That year, she also starred in the critically acclaimed action-drama &quot;Virasat&quot; for which she earned her first nomination at Filmfare for Best Actress (Critics). She followed this with a role in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s Tamil political drama &quot;Iruvar,&quot; which had an ensemble cast consisting of Mohanlal, Aishwarya Rai, Prakash Raj and Gautami. She also appeared in &quot;Chachi 420&quot; (1998), a remake of Tamil film &quot;Avvai Shanmughi&quot; co-starring Kamal Haasan. In her final release of the year, she starred in &quot;Aavida Maa Aavide.&quot;

In 1999, Tabu was seen among two successful ensemble films—the comedy &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; and the family drama &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot;, which went on to become the second highest-grossing, and the highest-grossing films of the year respectively. She also received near-unanimous critical acclaim for her performance in the drama &quot;Hu Tu Tu&quot;, with Namrata Joshi of &quot;India Today&quot; describing her as &quot;mesmerising and eloquent&quot;. She won her second Filmfare Best Actress (Critics) Award.

=== Career expansion (2000–2009) ===
In 2000, Tabu had five releases across several languages. She first starred in the comedy &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; and the drama &quot;Astitva&quot; in Hindi. The former was a box-office success, while the latter earned critical acclaim. Hindustan Times&#x27; Arnab Banerjee praised her performance in &quot;Astitva&quot;, writing: &quot;Tabu is brilliant and once again proves her mettle as an actress. The mind-blowing range of emotions she displays, her exquisite face and her subtle quiet dignity with which she handles her character, will take her far in her film career&quot;. She won her third Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) for &quot;Astitva&quot;, along with her fourth nomination for Best Actress. In the South, Tabu had two Tamil releases and one Malayalam film. Her Tamil films included the romantic musical &quot;Kandukondain Kandukondain&quot;, an adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and the mystery thriller &quot;Snegithiye&quot;. In &quot;Kandukondain Kandukondain&quot;, she starred alongside Mammootty, Ajith Kumar, and Aishwarya Rai as Sowmya, based on the character of Elinor Dashwood—Rai&#x27;s sagacious older sister. In &quot;Snegithiye&quot;, directed by Priyadarshan, Tabu portrayed a headstrong police officer investigating the murder of twin sisters. Both films were critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Tabu&#x27;s Malayalam release, the action thriller &quot;Cover Story&quot;, featured her alongside Suresh Gopi and received positive reviews from critics.

In 2001, Tabu starred in Madhur Bhandarkar&#x27;s &quot;Chandni Bar&quot; as a bar dancer. Despite her initial hesitation due to the failure of Bhandarkar&#x27;s previous film &quot;Trishakti&quot;, she accepted the role after hearing the film&#x27;s narration. The film, along with Tabu&#x27;s performance, received unanimous critical acclaim, and she received her second National Film Award for Best Actress and a fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Critic Taran Adarsh wrote, &quot;&quot;Chandni Bar&quot; is Tabu&#x27;s film all the way and there are no two opinions on that. Her performance deserves the highest marks and of course, all the awards. Her work is flawless and the impact her character makes on the minds of the viewer is also due to a tailor-made role&quot;. In a similar fashion, Salil Kumar of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; reviewed, &quot;if there is one actress who can carry a film on her shoulders, it is Tabu. As usual, she sparkles!&quot; Several publications have since regarded the performance as one of the finest of her career.

In 2003, Tabu starred in an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, titled &quot;Maqbool,&quot; that saw Irrfan Khan in the eponymous role. Based on the character of Lady Macbeth, she played Nimmi, Khan&#x27;s domineering wife. Helmed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the film was the first of his Shakespearean Trilogy and premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;Maqbool&quot; was a box-office failure, but was met with acclaim; Tabu&#x27;s performance also received unanimous acclaim with critic Ron Ahluwalia writing, &quot;Tabu shines in a dark role. The most versatile actress in Bollywood takes to villainy like second nature.&quot;.

She played the supporting role of a RAW officer in &quot;Fanaa&quot; (2006), alongside Aamir Khan and Kajol. The film went on to become the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. The same year, she starred in her first Hollywood film &quot;The Namesake&quot;, directed by Mira Nair. The film was a success overseas, and she received positive reviews for her performance. In R Balki&#x27;s romance &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; (2007), Tabu played a 34-year-old tourist in London who falls in love with a chef in his sixties (played by Amitabh Bachchan). Due to budget constraints, Balki borrowed equipment from Nikkhil Advani&#x27;s &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq&quot; for filming. &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; received positive reviews from critics; Taran Adarsh praised Tabu for holding her own in the presence of Bachchan. Though the film was moderately successful in the domestic market, it performed particularly well in the UK and US. She acquired a record-setting fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) for her performance in the film.

=== Career fluctuations (2010–2017) ===
Following a brief hiatus, which she attributed to being meticulous in her film selection, Tabu starred in &quot;Toh Baat Pakki!&quot;, a romantic comedy about a woman searching for a husband for her sister (played by Yuvika Chaudhary). The film was widely panned by critics, with Raja Sen of Rediff.com calling it a &quot;bland, preposterously dated &#x27;comedy&#x27;&quot; and pointing out that Tabu&#x27;s poorly written character limited her performance. She next starred opposite Sunny Deol as a CBI officer investigating the murder of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra in the action drama &quot;Khuda Kasam&quot;. Both &quot;Toh Baat Pakki!&quot; and &quot;Khuda Kasam&quot; had minuscule box-office returns. She returned to Malayalam cinema in 2011 with a song appearance in the multi-starrer &quot;Urumi&quot;, directed by Santosh Sivan. Tabu had also completed filming for B. R. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai&quot;; however, the film was indefinitely shelved due to plagiarism disputes.In 2012, she had a brief role in her second Hollywood film, &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, playing the protagonist&#x27;s mother. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her limited screen time as &quot;excellent&quot;. Tabu&#x27;s sole release of 2013 was in Bejoy Nambiar&#x27;s Hindi-Tamil bilingual crime thriller &quot;David&quot; co-starring Vikram and Neil Nitin Mukesh; the film failed at the box-office.
Keen to take on a light-hearted role, Tabu returned to commercial cinema with the Salman Khan-starrer &quot;Jai Ho&quot; (2014), a remake of the Telugu film &quot;Stalin&quot; (2006).&quot;&quot; Despite being six years younger than Khan, she played the role of his elder sister. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s David Chute wrote that, &quot;Stately-tall and with the profile of an Egyptian princess, Tabu is operating here several kilometers beneath her gifts&quot;. With a gross of over , it emerged as the sixth-highest grossing Hindi film of the year. She then reunited with Bhardwaj for &quot;Haider&quot;, his film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The film completed Bhardwaj&#x27;s Shakespearean Trilogy that previously featured Tabu in &quot;Maqbool&quot;. She initially passed on the role as she was hesitant toward playing a mother to Shahid Kapoor, but relented when Bhardwaj stressed the character&#x27;s importance to the plot. She essayed the role of Ghazala Meer, the Gertrude character, to Kapoor&#x27;s Haider (Hamlet). &quot;Haider&quot; received critical acclaim, with Tabu&#x27;s performance being particularly praised. Both Rachel Saltz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Lisa Tsering of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; concurred that Tabu overshadowed the rest of the cast with her performance. She earned her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Tabu continued to receive critical acclaim with her next venture, &quot;Drishyam&quot; (2015), in which she portrayed Meera, a police officer investigating the murder of her son. Directed by Nishikant Kamat, the film was a remake of the Malayalam film of the same name. Writing for Scroll.in, Nandini Ramnath wrote that Tabu&#x27;s &quot;raspy voice and impassive face convey the systemic obduracy that Meera Deshmukh represents&quot;. She earned her third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Both &quot;Haider&quot; and &quot;Drishyam&quot; emerged as modest commercial successes.

&quot;Fitoor&quot;—the Hindi adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot;—was Tabu&#x27;s sole release of 2016 alongside Katrina Kaif and Aditya Roy Kapur. Based on the character of Miss Havisham, she essayed the role of Begum Hazrat, Kaif&#x27;s manipulative mother. Tabu&#x27;s performance divided critics; While Rachel Saltz remarked that her performance was inferior to her other roles in adapted English tragedies, she praised her ability to convey loss with &quot;her great tragedienne&#x27;s face&quot;, and Subhash K. Jha of &quot;Firstpost&quot; thought that she had been miscast in the role of Kaif&#x27;s mother, but both criticised the inadequacy of the script. It emerged as a box-office bomb. In 2017, Tabu joined Rohit Shetty&#x27;s &quot;Golmaal&quot; (film series) in the sequel &quot;Golmaal Again&quot;. She cited her admiration for Shetty&#x27;s work as the reason for her return to comedy. Her portrayal of a ghostbuster drew praise from critics with &quot;The Indian Express&quot;″ Shubhra Gupta writing that &quot;her inclusion to the film is an unexpected pleasure&quot;. &quot;Golmaal Again&quot; became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of the year.

===Resurgence (2018–present)===
Tabu&#x27;s first release of 2018 was Mukul Abhyankar&#x27;s &quot;Missing&quot;, a thriller opposite Manoj Bajpayee. She lent her vocals for the film&#x27;s only song, a lullaby titled &quot;So Ja Re&quot;. Despite earning praise for her portrayal of a mother in search of her missing daughter, the film underperformed at the box office. She followed this with a special appearance in Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s biopic &quot;Sanju&quot;, starring Ranbir Kapoor. Tabu described her scene in the film as her &quot;Truman Show moment&quot;, as she recreated the moment she presented Sanjay Dutt the award for Best Actor in a Comic Role at the 49th Filmfare Awards. A turning point in her career came with Sriram Raghavan&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Andhadhun&quot;, which saw her as the parallel lead to Ayushmann Khurrana. The film, along with her performance, received unanimous critical acclaim. Critic Rajeev Masand lauded Tabu as &quot;the film&#x27;s towering performance&quot; and reviewers for &quot;Reuters&quot; and &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; commended her capabilities as the femme fatale. With a gross of over , the film emerged as a top-grossing Indian film, and earned her a sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress&quot;,&quot; and fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics).

In Akiv Ali&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;De De Pyaar De&quot; (2019), she starred as the ex-wife of Devgn&#x27;s character who disapproves of his relationship with a younger woman (played by Rakul Preet Singh). She was drawn to exploring how a middle-aged divorcee navigates love. &quot;Rediff.com&quot;″s Sukanya Verma praised Tabu for enhancing a mediocre picture. She ended the year with a brief role as the missing younger sister of Salman Khan&#x27;s character in Ali Abbas Zafar&#x27;s partition drama &quot;Bharat.&quot;

Tabu made her comeback to Telugu cinema after a decade, appearing in Trivikram Srinivas&#x27; &quot;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&quot; (2020), as the mother of Allu Arjun&#x27;s character. The film went on to become the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year and Tabu&#x27;s performance received praised critically, earning her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress (Telugu). She followed this with both her television and streaming foray as Saeeda Begum, a ghazal singer who engages in a relationship with a younger man (played by Ishaan Khatter) in Nair&#x27;s post-partition drama &quot;A Suitable Boy.&quot; Based on Vikram Seth&#x27;s 1993 novel of the same name, the series marked the first BBC period-drama series to have a non-white cast. Critics were divided on the series, but Tabu&#x27;s performance earned widespread praise; in a positive review for RogerEbert.com, Roxana Hadadi wrote that Tabu &quot;gives nuance to Saeeda’s sense of otherness in a community that seems to both treasure and abhor her&quot;. She ended the year with a brief role (billed as a special appearance) in the unremarkable family comedy &quot;Jawaani Jaaneman.&quot;In the spiritual sequel &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2&quot; (2022), Tabu received critical acclaim for her dual role as twin sisters seeking vengeance against each other. She found the experience of playing the dual role particularly challenging as she had to showcase the characters in multiple time periods. Reception to the film was generally mixed but Tabu&#x27;s performance was seen as a highlight; Writing for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, Monika Rawal Kukreja thought that Tabu &quot;stole the show&quot;, but considered her portrayal of Manjulika inferior to that of Vidya Balan&#x27;s in the predecessor. She earned a seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress&quot;,&quot; and a record-setting fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics). Later that year, she reprised her role as Meera in the thriller sequel &quot;Drishyam 2&quot;, directed by Abhishek Pathak. Archika Khurana of &quot;The Times of India&quot; described her as &quot;simply outstanding&quot;, and WION&#x27;s Shomini Sen appreciated her for subtly complementing Devgn&#x27;s performance. Both &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2&quot; and &quot;Drishyam 2&quot; rank among the highest-grossing Hindi films of 2022, with the latter earning over worldwide.

2023 witnessed Tabu portray a government official thrice in the thrillers &quot;Kuttey&quot;, &quot;Bholaa&quot; and &quot;Khufiya&quot;. In &quot;Kuttey&quot;, she essayed the role of a corrupt police officer—a role originally written for a man. Sukanya Verma commended Tabu for elevating a poorly-written script. Once again as a police officer, Tabu starred opposite Devgn in the action thriller &quot;Bholaa&quot;, which he also directed. In her mixed review of the film, Monika Rawal Kukreja felt that Tabu had not been given adequate scope to perform as she is &quot;made to disappear as Devgn takes spotlight while fighting the bad guys&quot;. Both &quot;Kuttey&quot; and &quot;Bholaa&quot; underperformed at the box-office. In &quot;Khufiya&quot;, she reunited with Bhardwaj for their fifth collaboration as an operative of an intelligence agency alongside Ali Fazal and Wamiqa Gabbi. Released directly on to Netflix, the film had a generally ambivalent reception from critics. Anuj Kumar of &quot;The Hindu&quot; was appreciative of Tabu&#x27;s consistent performances in Bhardwaj&#x27;s projects, but thought that she had been overshadowed by Gabbi.

Tabu returned to commercial cinema in 2024 alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan and Kriti Sanon in the female-led heist comedy &quot;Crew&quot;, in which the trio played flight attendants. In preparation, they received training from former cabin crew members. &quot;Outlook&quot; Garima Das commended Tabu as the film&#x27;s standout. Ranking among the top-grossing Hindi films of 2024, it emerged as a major commercial success. She next reunited with Devgn for their tenth collaboration in Neeraj Pandey&#x27;s &quot;Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha&quot;, a romantic thriller about a married woman who rekindles a relationship with her incarcerated former lover&quot;.&quot; The film was unable to recoup its estimated investment. Lachmi Deb Roy of &quot;Firstpost&quot; panned the film&#x27;s antiquated storyline and the underutilisation of both Devgn and Tabu, though Dhaval Roy took note of Tabu delivering a performance of &quot;quiet intensity&quot;. In her final release of the year, she had a brief role as Francesca in the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise prequel series &quot;&quot;, a character she described as &quot;deep and intense&quot;. Praising her styling and look in the series, Mini Anthikad Chhibber of &quot;The Hindu&quot; remarked that &quot;Tabu does what she can with her thinly written character&quot;, and &quot;The Hindustan Times&quot;&#x27; Abhimanyu Mathur compared her performance unfavourably to those of her other English-language roles in &quot;Life of Pi&quot; and &quot;The Namesake.&quot;

She will next star opposite Akshay Kumar in Priyadarshan&#x27;s horror comedy &quot;Bhoot Bangla&quot; and reunite with Devgn and Rakul Preet Singh for the sequel &quot;De De Pyaar De 2&quot;.

==Media image and artistry==

Tabu is among the most accomplished actresses in Hindi cinema, known for her work in both mainstream and independent cinema. &quot;India Today&quot; observes that Tabu&#x27;s &quot;uncontrived freshness&quot; and &quot;mobile face&quot; have made her a favourite in Bollywood, with her performances showcasing &quot;a considerable range&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; adds that her presence in a film&#x27;s credits automatically raises audience expectations. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Tabu portrayed strong, women-oriented characters long before such roles were labelled &quot;game-changers,&quot; while &quot;Vogue&quot; highlights her ability to deliver &quot;non-stop stellar and heart-swooning performances.&quot; &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; describes her as a &quot;versatile performer&quot; often called upon to bring depth to commercial blockbusters. &quot;Film Companion&quot; has commented on the &quot;aura of mystery&quot; surrounding her as a celebrity, adding that her onscreen presence carries an &quot;ineffable, intuitive quality.&quot; Despite having no formal acting background, Tabu considers herself a risk-taker, relying on instinct and her director&#x27;s guidance rather than extensive preparation.

Members of the Indian film industry have often commented on Tabu&#x27;s beauty and talent. Lyricist Gulzar hailed Tabu as &quot;the beginning of a new era&quot; and &quot;a thinking actress in the mould of Nargis, Nutan and Meena Kumari&quot;. For filmmaker Karan Johar, Tabu is &quot;truly the country&#x27;s greatest actor&quot;, as well as &quot;versatile&quot;, &quot;adaptive&quot; and &quot;timeless&quot;. She describes her aunt, Shabana Azmi, as her &quot;biggest critic&quot;. In 2023, journalist Rajeev Masand named her one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s best actresses of all time.

Known to be selective about her film roles, Tabu once said, &quot;I do films which move me and most of all, the unit and the director should appeal to me&quot;. In 2019, at the 17th Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles she was honoured with &quot;Opening Night Tribute&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Film Companion&quot; ranked Tabu&#x27;s performance in &quot;Haider&quot; and &quot;Andhadhun&quot; among the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of the Decade&quot;. &quot;India Today&quot; named her in their &quot;Top Bollywood Actresses&quot; list. She was placed in &quot;Filmfare&quot;″s &quot;Top Ten Actresses&quot; of 2003. In &quot;Rediff.com&quot;″s &quot;Top Ten Actresses&quot; list, she ranked 9th in 2007. She topped the list in 2014 and 2018. In 1998, Tabu received the Smita Patil Memorial Award for Best Actress, for her contribution to Indian cinema. &quot;Forbes India&quot; included Tabu in its &quot;50 Showstoppers&quot; list of 2022.

==Controversy==

In 1998, Tabu was charged with poaching two blackbucks on the outskirts of Kankani village in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan during the filming of &quot;Hum Saath Saath Hain&quot; along with co-stars Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Neelam Kothari. A lower court charged her with the others under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the IPC. She had filed a revision petition before a sessions court which discharged her of Section 51 (causing harm to wildlife) of Wildlife Act and both of 147 (punishment for rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly of persons) of the Indian Penal Code. The Rajasthan State Government then filed a revision petition before the Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur which again added Section 149 against her, which had been dropped earlier. In December 2012, the Jodhpur court summoned her along with all the accused for commencement of the trial with the revised charges on 4 February 2013. Although Tabu was acquitted in the blackbuck poaching case on 5 April 2018, the Rajasthan High Court issued her with a notice, challenging her acquittal on 11 March 2019.

== Awards and nominations ==
Tabu received the National Film Award for Best Actress for &quot;Maachis&quot; and &quot;Chandni Bar&quot;. She received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) for &quot;Virasat&quot;, &quot;Hu Tu Tu&quot;, &quot;Astitva&quot;, &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; and &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyya 2&quot;, along with Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Haider&quot;, and the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for &quot;Vijaypath&quot;. She was awarded the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award, by the Government of India for her contributions towards the arts in 2011.

<text>The Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino () was the umbrella political opposition coalition during the 1998 Philippine general election that led to the election of then Vice President Joseph Estrada as President of the Philippines. It was the largest political party during that time, uniting the major Philippine political parties which included Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino, Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition and Partido ng Masang Pilipino, along with minor and regional parties. 

Estrada won the presidential election against then-House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr.. Meanwhile, Estrada&#x27;s running mate Edgardo Angara lost to fellow senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of Lakas–NUCD–UMDP.

Shortly after the 1998 elections, the party&#x27;s name was changed into Lapian ng Masang Pilipino (Organization of the Filipino Masses), as the &quot;struggle&quot; ended with Estrada&#x27;s victory.

==Slogan==
The coalition devised an acronym for the Senate slate which is: TPW (&quot;The Pilipino Win/The Philippine Way&quot;), JOBS and LABOR. T stands for Torres; P for Pimentel; W for Webb; J for Jaworski; O for Ople; B for Bagatsing; S for Sotto; L for Lagman; A for Aquino-Oreta; B for Biazon; O for Osmeña; R for Romero.

==Senatorial slate==
Below is the official senatorial slate of LAMMP for the 1998 Philippine senatorial election.

==Election results==
The success of the coalition was partly because of the popularity of its presidential bet, Vice President Estrada who won the presidential election. His senatorial slate also gained majority of 7 out of 12 available seats in the Senate. The following were the LAMMP senatorial bets who won:

* Tito Sotto 
* Nene Pimentel
* Rodolfo Biazon
* Blas Ople
* John Henry Osmeña
* Robert Jaworski
* Tessie Aquino-Oreta

The coalition also gained great majority in the House of Representatives and majority of elected local officials who ran as members of the coalition.

== Abolishment ==

LAMMP was abolished during the 2001 midterm legislative elections and was replaced by a new coalition of pro-Estrada legislators led by Angara&#x27;s LDP, named &quot;Puwersa ng Masa&quot; (Force of the Masses) which was led by Estrada&#x27;s wife, Luisa Pimentel-Ejercito.

<text>Marie-Claire Blais (5 October 1939 – 30 November 2021) was a Canadian writer, novelist, poet, and playwright from the province of Quebec. In a career spanning seventy years, she wrote novels, plays, collections of poetry and fiction, newspaper articles, radio dramas, and scripts for television. She was a four-time recipient of the Governor General’s literary prize for French-Canadian literature, and was also a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for creative arts.

Some of her works included &quot;La Belle Bête&quot; (1959)&quot;, The Manuscripts of Pauline Archange&quot; (1968)&quot;, Deaf to the City&quot; (1979), and a ten-volume series &quot;Soifs&quot; written between 1995 and 2018.

== Early life ==
Blais was born on 5 October 1939 into a blue collar family in Québec, the daughter of Fernando and Véronique (Nolin) Blais. She was the eldest in a family of five children. She studied at a convent school, but had to interrupt her education at the age of 15 to seek employment as a clerk and later as a typist. At the age of seventeen, she enrolled in a few classes at Université Laval, where she met professor and literary critic Jeanne Lapointe and priest and sociologist Georges-Henri Lévesque, both of whom encouraged her to write.

== Career ==
Blais published her first novel &quot;La Belle Bête&quot; (translated as &quot;Mad Shadows&quot;) in 1959, when she turned 20. She received a grant from the Canada Council of Arts which allowed her to begin writing full-time. She first moved to Paris and later moved to the United States in 1963 initially living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. She was also helped by American literary critic Edmund Wilson who introduced her to artists and writers in Cape Cod including feminist Barbara Deming and writer and painter Mary Meigs. The three lived together in Wellfleet for six years. Blais remained a longtime partner of Mary Meigs until Meigs&#x27; death in 2002.

During this time, Blais was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships. In 1975, after two years of living in Brittany, France, she moved back to Québec. For about twenty years she divided her time between Montréal, the Eastern Townships of Québec and Key West, Florida, where she maintained her permanent home.

In 1972, she became a Companion of the Order of Canada. Many of her works have been adapted for other formats: &quot;La belle bête&quot; was made into a ballet by the National Ballet of Canada in 1977. The same book was made into a movie by Karim Hussain in 1976. Hussain won the Director&#x27;s Award at the Boston Underground Film Festival for his work. Some of Blais&#x27; other works that were made into movies included &quot;Une saison dans la vie d&#x27;Emmanuel&quot; (Claude Weisz, 1973), which won the Prix de la Quinzaine des jeunes réalisateurs at the Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Le sourd dans la ville&quot; (Mireille Dansereau, 1987), which won an award at the Venice Film Festival, and &quot;L&#x27;océan&quot; (Jean Feuchère, 1971).

Blais won the Governor General&#x27;s Prize in Canada for two of her novels, &quot;The Manuscripts of Pauline Archange&quot; (1968) and &quot;Deaf to the City&quot; (1979). She also wrote a 10-volume series starting with &quot;Soifs&quot; (1995) () translated into English as &quot;These Festive Islands&quot;. The series was set in an island town modeled on Key West and featured an interlocked cast of over a hundred characters including drag queens, painters, writers, and , many of them based on acquaintances that she had made on the island where she had been a part of a community that included a journalist and novelist John Hersey and poet James Merrill. The writing was based on long sentences described as &#x27;meandering&#x27; with a combination rapidly shifting between characters&#x27; internal monologues and dialogues. The books were written in a &#x27;stream-of-consciousness&#x27; style, with no chapters and no paragraph breaks. The last book in the 10-volume series &quot;Une réunion près de la mer&quot; was published in 2018.

She sponsored the starting in 2005; awarded annually to a French author for their debut novel.

Blais enjoyed an ardent readership in French language literature and had won four Governor General&#x27;s Literary Awards throughout her career. Writing in an article in a Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, literary critic Jade Colbert called her &quot;the 21st century Virginia Woolf&quot; while Quebec novelist Michel Tremblay called her &quot;one of our greatest national treasures&quot;.

In addition to her novels, Blais has written several plays, collections of poetry and fiction, newspaper articles, radio dramas, and scripts for television. Her works had characters that included delinquent children, wayward nuns and abusive priests and included issues like white supremacy, nuclear holocaust, and the AIDS epidemic. Her books included suffering as recurring themes, though she herself had noted in an interview that she preferred serenity to suffering.

== Personal life ==
Blais was a longtime partner of American writer and painter Mary Meigs. Meigs predeceased her in 2002.

Blais died on November 30, 2021, in Key West, Florida.

<text>The Avon Gorge () is a 1.5-mile (2.5-kilometre) long gorge on the River Avon in Bristol, England. The gorge runs south to north through a limestone ridge west of Bristol city centre, and about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth of the river at Avonmouth. The gorge forms the boundary between the unitary authorities of North Somerset and Bristol, with the boundary running along the south bank. As Bristol was an important port, the gorge formed a defensive gateway to the city.

On the east of the gorge is the Bristol suburb of Clifton, and The Downs, a large public park. To the west of the gorge is Leigh Woods, the name of both a village and the National Trust forest it is situated in. There are three Iron Age hill forts overlooking the gorge, as well as an observatory. The Clifton Suspension Bridge, an icon of Bristol, crosses the gorge.


== Geology and formation ==

The gorge cuts through a ridge mainly of limestone, with some sandstone. This particular ridge runs from Clifton to Clevedon, 10 miles (16 km) away on the Bristol Channel coast, although limestone is found throughout the Bristol area. The fossil shells and corals indicate that the limestone formed in shallow tropical seas in the Carboniferous, 350 million years ago. For a long time it was unclear what caused the Avon to cut through the limestone ridge, rather than run southwest through the Ashton Vale towards Weston-super-Mare. However, Bristol was at the southern edge of glaciation during the Anglian ice age, and it has been suggested that ice blocked the river&#x27;s natural route through Ashton Vale to the west. At the Clifton Suspension Bridge the Gorge is more than wide and deep.

In the 18th century the gorge was quarried to produce building stone for the city. Stone was taken by boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world&#x27;s celestine, but the enterprise did not last long into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.

== Ecology ==

The steep walls of the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts&#x27;s whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are many parts of the gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.

The steep gorge walls make an ideal habitat for peregrine falcons, with a plentiful supply of food nearby in the form of pigeons and gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in the gorge, but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in the gorge after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to the gorge, and have successfully bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in the gorge, on which birds of prey soar while hunting. The gorge also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes in the caves and bridge buttresses.

Due to its geology and ecology, an area of of the gorge and surrounding woodland has been protected as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the original notification taking place in 1952. The site may in future be protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The Leigh Woods side of the gorge is largely owned by the National Trust. The Downs on the city side of the gorge are owned by Bristol City Council and managed as a large public park. The gorge side is protected in partnership with Bristol Zoo, WWF and English Nature. The council&#x27;s management of the gorge involves balancing the need to protect its ecology with recreational uses such as rock climbing.

Green-flowered helleborine is found on the western side of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley on the west side of the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane&#x27;s-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.

== History of human use ==

The gorge area was inhabited at least as early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above Nightingale Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BC to 1AD, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces of the gorge and Nightingale Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across Nightingale Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated on the opposite side of the gorge, in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, suggest they played a role in defending the gorge.

During the Middle Ages and Industrial Revolution the area which now forms The Downs was used as common grazing land. It was mined for lead, calamine, iron and limestone, and became home to a windmill which produced snuff from the tobacco which had become one of the city&#x27;s principal imports. In 1777 the windmill burnt out in a storm, and the building was converted into the observatory, which houses a camera obscura. In the 18th and 19th centuries Bristol&#x27;s economy boomed and Clifton became a desirable place to live. Mansion houses were built overlooking the gorge, but after grazing was stopped, trees grew and obscured the view from these mansions. In the Victorian era, with houses creeping further onto the Downs, an Act of Parliament was passed to protect them as a park for the people of Bristol. In 1754 a bridge to span the gorge was proposed, but it was nearly 80 years before work began on Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge, and a further 30 years before it was completed. Today the bridge is perhaps the best known landmark in Bristol.

Throughout Bristol&#x27;s history the gorge has been an important transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. It is the gateway to Bristol Harbour, and provided protection against storms or attack. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the &quot;SS Demerara&quot; soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner &quot;Gipsy&quot; in 1878, the steam tug &quot;Black Eagle&quot; in 1861 and the &quot;Llandaff City&quot;. The phrase &quot;ship shape and Bristol fashion&quot; arises from when the main harbour in Bristol was tidal, the bottom of which was rocky. If ships were not of stout construction then they would simply break up as the tide receded, hence the phrase.
A railway, the Bristol Port Railway, was built through the gorge on the east side from Hotwells to Avonmouth between 1863 and 1865. The Portishead Railway was opened on the west side in 1867. The section of the Bristol Port Railway between Hotwells and Sneyd Park junction was closed in 1922, when construction of a major road through the gorge, the Portway, was started. The Portway was opened in 1926. The road is now part of the A4 road, linking Bristol city centre to the M5 motorway, which bypasses the city near Avonmouth. In the late 1990s the wide pavement through nearly all the Avon Gorge was designated to be legally usable by both cyclists and the fewer pedestrians.

Two railways still run through the gorge. On the east side the Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and Severn Beach uses the remaining part of the Bristol Port Railway through part of the gorge, and through a tunnel under the Downs. On the west side the Portishead Railway was closed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, but has since been reopened for freight traffic as far as Royal Portbury Dock, 2.5 miles (4 km) downstream, and funding is now in place to reopen the rest of the line and reintroduce passenger services to Portishead. Between 1893 and 1934, the Clifton Rocks Railway linked the passenger steamer pier at Hotwells with Clifton on the rim of the gorge.

A footpath and National Cycle Network cycleway run alongside the Portishead Railway and along the old towpath.

The gorge&#x27;s proximity to the urban population of Bristol made it a popular venue for rock climbing from the 1940s – a time when most UK climbing was centred in mountain areas. The first guide to climbing routes in Avon Gorge was published in 1955 by the University of Bristol Mountaineering Club. The same year, British mountaineer Chris Bonington climbed Main Wall putting up Mercavity. The 2017 edition of The Climbers&#x27; Club Guide to Avon Gorge by Martin Crocker lists 400 pages of routes and guidance. Avon Gorge is often criticised as being so over-climbed many of the routes are &quot;polished&quot;.

== Mythology ==
The formation of the Avon Gorge is the subject of mediaeval mythology. The myths tell tales of two giant brothers, Goram and Vincent, who constructed the gorge. One variation holds that Vincent and Goram were constructing the gorge together and Goram fell asleep, to be accidentally killed by Vincent&#x27;s pickaxe. Another variation tells of the brothers falling for Avona, a girl from Wiltshire, who instructs the giants to drain a lake which stretches from Rownham Hill to Bradford-on-Avon (i.e. the Avon valley). Goram began digging the nearby Hazel Brook Gorge in Blaise Castle estate, but consumed too much beer and fell asleep. Vincent dug the Avon Gorge and drained the lake, winning the affection of Avona. Upon waking Goram stamped his foot, creating &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Footprint&quot; in the Blaise Castle estate, and threw himself into the Bristol Channel, turning to stone and leaving his head and shoulder above water as the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm.

<text>The Harpers are a fictional and semi-secret organization in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting of the role playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

==Publication history==
The Harpers were introduced in 1987 as part of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, as written by Ed Greenwood. &quot;The Code of the Harpers&quot; (1993), also written by Greenwood, is a resource book for runes, spells, and other unique abilities only Harpers have.

==Organization==
The organization was created near the founding of Myth Drannor by elven elders, generals, and priests, and led by an elven mage named &quot;Lady Steel&quot; (and advised by a young Elminster.) Over time, and after the fall of Myth Drannor, this organization evolved into a new group, founded by Elminster and other influential and powerful individuals, with support from many freedom loving and good-aligned deities and churches (although the churches don&#x27;t always agree with Harper aims, the deities themselves do.) The deities who sponsored the Harpers are; Deneir, Eldath, Liira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Selune, Silvanus, Tymora, and The entire Seldarine. Most of the Seven Sisters, especially Storm Silverhand, are dedicated Harpers.

Pushing for Balance as well as what is right, they oppose all evil organizations such as the Zhentarim and the Red Wizards of Thay. The Harpers strive for many small, allied kingdoms, keeping rulers close to their people and too occupied with actively helping their subjects to be concerned with making war and conquering their neighbors. They are also concerned with maintaining a balance between nature and civilization, keeping woodlands and other natural areas safe from too much destruction, and with preserving all knowledge and learning, especially history, music and art. They recruit a variety of people, but the majority tend to be human, elven, and half-elven rangers and bards (people who are free to roam around a lot); there are more female than male Harpers. Harper members are recognizable by their magically imbued silver pins, which grant various magical protections (such as immunity to electricity, and to magic missiles.)

Harpers are hated in many countries such as Thay or Tethyr, for a variety of reasons, but especially for their vehement opposition to the practice of slavery. The Tethyrian government has a grudge against the Harpers for assassinating their last recognized leader, driving the country of Tethyr into a swirling chaos of civil war and assassinations. However, the Harpers were framed by another, unknown, secret organization.

In 1371DR - The Year of the Unstrung Harp (1 year previously to the start of the 3rd edition campaign) - there has been growing divisions between the Harpers who wished to further the cause of Balance (neutral-aligned) and those who wished to combat evil (good-aligned). A schism happened after the Harper Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun made a deal with Fzoul Chembryl, leader of the Zhentarim. He was expelled from the Harpers, and, with his wife Laeral Silverhand of the Seven Sisters, he went on to form the Harper splinter organization known as the Moonstars.

==Other media==

===&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;===
The Harpers are part of the plot of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; computer game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

===&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;===
The Harpers play an important role in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;.

===&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;===
The Harpers can be either allies or enemies to the characters in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;.

===Film===
In the 2023 film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;, Edgin is a member of the Harpers.

==Reception==
Jonathan Palmer for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine commented on the Harpers as &quot;fighters for freedom and justice. Laudable.&quot;

<text>Southern University and A&amp;M College (Southern University, Southern, SUBR or SU) is a public historically black land-grant university in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. It is the largest historically black college or university (HBCU) in Louisiana, a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and the flagship institution of the Southern University System. Its campus encompasses , with an agricultural experimental station on an additional site, north of the main campus on Scott&#x27;s Bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in the northern section of Baton Rouge.

Southern University&#x27;s 13 intercollegiate athletics teams are known as the Jaguars, and are members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) in NCAA Division I. The Human Jukebox is a well known collegiate marching band that has been representing Southern University since 1947.

==History==
At the 1879 Louisiana State Constitutional Convention, African-American political leaders P.B.S. Pinchback, Theophile T. Allain and Henry Demas proposed founding a higher education institution &quot;for the education of persons of color&quot;.

In 1880, the Louisiana General Assembly chartered what was then called Southern University for Colored Students, originally located in New Orleans. Southern opened its doors on March 7, 1881 with 12 students. The school was held for a time at the former Israel Sinai Temple on Calliope Street, between St. Charles and Camp streets.

In 1890, the legislature designated Southern as a land grant college for blacks, in order to continue to satisfy federal requirements under the land grant program to support higher education for all students in the state, despite having a segregated system. It established an Agricultural and Mechanical department.
The 1904 &quot;Picayune Guide to New Orleans&quot; described the university, then on the 5100 block of Magazine Street in Uptown New Orleans, as &quot;for the education of colored persons. Coeducation is in force here. The school is excellent and the instruction of an advanced character.&quot;

For various reasons, including proximity to more rural Louisiana residents and pressure from White neighbors in the Tulane area, in 1914 the university moved to Scotlandville, an area just north of Baton Rouge along Scott&#x27;s Bluff facing the Mississippi River. Now absorbed into the capital, this area is included as a historic destination of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. The first president of college after the move was Dr. Joseph Samuel Clark, an African-American leader from Baton Rouge, who previously led Baton Rouge College and the Louisiana Colored Teachers Association.

In 1921, the Louisiana Constitutional Convention authorized the reorganization and expansion of Southern University; Legislative Act 100 of 1922 provided that the institution be reorganized under the control of the State Board of Education. Clark continued to preside over Southern University during its resulting expansion. Student enrollment grew from 47 to 500, and two of the school&#x27;s early buildings were built during this time.

The Southern University Laboratory School System began operating in September 1922. The Laboratory School was first accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1936 and has conferred more than 5,000 high school diplomas since its inception. Clark presided until his retirement in 1938.

Clark&#x27;s son Dr. Felton Grandison Clark was appointed as president that year. He had been serving as a dean at Southern since 1934. The State School for the Negro Deaf and Blind was established here in 1938, under supervision of Southern University. In 1943, the university was visited by the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. F. G. Clark generated much more expansion of the university: 33 of 114 current buildings were erected during his 30 years of tenure. The student enrollment grew from 500 to nearly 10,000 students by the end of his tenure.

Under segregated state education, LSU Law School had refused to admit Charles J. Hatfield, III, an African American college graduate who filed a lawsuit in 1946 to gain professional education in the state. A special Louisiana Convention established a law program in 1947 at Southern University; it is now known as the Southern University Law Center. F. G. Clark expanded affiliated centers for Southern University, founding Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO) (1956) and Southern University at Shreveport (SUSLA) (1964). They were officially incorporated by the legislature into the Southern University System in 1974.

In 1969, Clark retired and Dr. G. Leon Netterville was selected as president. On November 16, 1972, in a second day of protests as students argued to be included in determining administration policies and decisions, Denver Smith and Leonard Brown were shot during a protest outside the Old Auditorium (now the Southern University Museum of Art). The murders have never been solved, but the students were killed with buckshot, which the sheriff&#x27;s deputies were using. These two students were involved with &quot;Students United,&quot; a student activist group. The governor and sheriff&#x27;s office denied that their people were responsible for the deaths. Governor Edwin Edwards ordered the campus temporarily closed, and it was patrolled by troops to keep the peace.

The institution continued to grow. In 1974, a special session in the Louisiana Legislature established the Southern University System, with Jesse N. Stone of Shreveport as its president. The system consists of Southern University and A&amp;M College, Baton Rouge (SUBR); Southern University, New Orleans (SUNO); Southern University Law Center (SULC); Southern University Agricultural Center (SUAC); and Southern University, Shreveport (SUSLA). SUSLA is a two-year commuter college.

Between 1970 and 1990, the university consistently enrolled over 10,000 students and secured the title of being the largest HBCU in the nation.

Between 2004 and 2013, Southern University ranked 4th in the nation for baccalaureate-origin institution of black male doctorate recipients.

In 2013, Southern University was censured from the American Association of University Professors for &quot;for its decision during the 2011-12 school year to lay off 19 tenured professors while giving the faculty little to no say in the matter.&quot;

In 2021, Southern attained the R2 Carnegie Classification (Doctoral University; High Research Activity). Southern is one of only 11 HBCUs to be granted R2 status and the first HBCU in Louisiana in this category.

==Academics==

Southern has six degree-granting colleges and a law school on campus:

*College of Education, Arts, and Humanities
*College of Business
*College of Sciences and Engineering
*College of Social and Behavioral Sciences
*College of Sciences and Agriculture
*College of Nursing and Allied Health
*Southern University Law Center

The Southern University Law Center is one of only two public law schools in Louisiana. The law school is accredited by the American Bar Association and was established in 1947. The law school has approximately 700 full-time and part-time students and operates as an independent entity.

Southern University is the first Louisiana institution to offer degrees in philanthropic studies.

In 2023, the College of Nursing and Allied Health won Louisiana&#x27;s nursing school of the year award given by the Louisiana Nursing Foundation for the sixth time. The college is one of only two in Louisiana to offer a PhD in Nursing and is the largest producer of African Americans with Master of Science in Nursing degrees in the nation.

Southern University is the only HBCU and one of six public universities in Louisiana with an engineering program.

Southern University has nationally recognized Army and Navy ROTC programs.

The Dolores Spikes Honors College is a selective non degree-granting college specifically established to provide an enhanced educational experience for undergraduates with strong academic achievements and intellectual ability. The college is named after Southern University graduate and only woman president of the institution, Dr. Dolores Richard Spikes.

Southern University and A&amp;M College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==Legacy of Lacumba==

Southern University was the first HBCU to house a live exotic animal mascot on campus. Henry J. Bellaire, alumnus and president of the 1961 senior class, and alumna Helen Williams presented a baby jaguar as a gift to Southern University. The jaguar was named &quot;Lacumba&quot; (meaning &quot;Heart of Africa&quot;) and was born on May 26, 1971. In 1991, Lacumba retired to the Acadiana Zoo in Broussard, LA and was replaced with Lacumba II. Lacumba II (commonly referred to as simply Lacumba) was born on May 12, 1991, the offspring of two rare black jaguars bred in hopes of producing a black jaguar. However, Lacumba II was born brown; it grew to be 200 pounds. Lacumba II died of natural causes at the age of 15 in December 2004 and was the last jaguar to live on campus. Animal rights advocates dissuaded the university from purchasing a new jaguar. The jaguar pen remains in front of the A.W. Mumford football stadium off Harding Boulevard. The legacy of Lacumba lives on through the school&#x27;s costumed jaguar mascot, Cafe Lacumba, a bronze jaguar statue near Mumford stadium, and a jaguar named after Lacumba at the Baton Rouge Zoo.

<doc id="989271" wikidata="Q2734717" url="?curid=989271" title="Within a Mile of Home">
<text>Within a Mile of Home is the third studio album by the Celtic punk band Flogging Molly. Released in 2004, the album reached No. 20 on the U.S. Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 1 on the Independent Music chart. The album is dedicated to Joe Strummer and Johnny Cash, as indicated in the album&#x27;s liner notes. The song &quot;To Youth (My Sweet Roisin Dubh)&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot;.

== Reception ==

In their review, &quot;AllMusic&quot; noted Flogging Molly&#x27;s &quot;more mature, more polished&quot; sound on this album and its stylistic variations. They pointed to the Cajun-influenced accordions on &quot;Tomorrow Comes a Day Too Soon&quot;, the a capella performance on &quot;The Wrong Company&quot; and guest Lucinda Williams&#x27; guest appearance on &quot;Factory Girls&quot; as evidence of this. The reviewer also appreciated the album&#x27;s varied themes which include modern-day U.S. policy concerns (&quot;Screaming at the Wailing Wall&quot;) and Oliver Cromwell shipping Irish workers to Barbados during the 17th century (&quot;Tobacco Island&quot;). In another positive review, &quot;Punknews.org&quot; said that Flogging Molly &quot;have a mastery of the traditional sound, and their harder and faster songs are definitely a lot of fun.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;PopMatters&quot; had high praise for the album. The review referred to the opening track &quot;Screaming at the Wailing Wall&quot; as a &quot;toe-tapping, arm-in-arm Celtic boogie tune&quot; and the following song &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; as a &quot;kitchen-party Celtic assault&quot;. The review also noted that the song &quot;To Youth (My Sweet Roisin Dubh)&quot; sounds like a &quot;Dublin-ized Mike Ness of Social Distortion&quot; and that &quot;The Wanderlust&quot; as a combination of The Clash and The Pogues.
