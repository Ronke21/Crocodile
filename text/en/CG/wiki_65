<doc id="994247" wikidata="Q3110657" url="?curid=994247" title="Nissan RB engine">
<text>The RB engine is an oversquare 2.0–3.0 L straight-6 four-stroke gasoline engine from Nissan, originally produced from 1985 to 2004. The RB followed the 1983 VG-series V6 engines to offer a full, modern range in both straight or V layouts. It was part of a new engine family name PLASMA (Powerful ＆ Economic, Lightweight, Accurate, Silent, Mighty, Advanced).

The RB engine family includes single overhead camshaft (SOHC) and double overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines. Both SOHC and DOHC versions have an aluminium head. The SOHC versions have 2 valves per cylinder and the DOHC versions have 4 valves per cylinder; each cam lobe moves only one valve. All RB engines have belt driven cams and a cast iron block. Most turbo models have an intercooled turbo (the exceptions being the single cam RB20ET &amp; RB30ET engines), and most have a recirculating factory blow off valve (the exceptions being when fitted to Laurels and Cefiros) to reduce compressor surge when the throttle quickly closes.

The RB engines are derived from the six-cylinder L20A engine, which has the same bore and stroke as the RB20. All RB engines were made in Yokohama, Japan where the VR38DETT engine was made. Some RB engines were rebuilt by Nissan&#x27;s NISMO division at the Omori Factory in Tokyo as well. All Z-Tune Skylines were rebuilt at the Omori Factory.

After a 15-year hiatus, production of the RB series resumed in 2019.

==Bore and stroke==
All Nissan engines follow a naming convention, identifying the engine family (in this case, RB), displacement, features present—see the list of Nissan engines for details.

The stock dimensions for the Nissan RB Engine:
* RB20 - , bore x stroke: 
* RB24 - , bore x stroke: 
* RB25 - , bore x stroke: 
* RB26 - , bore x stroke: 
* RB30 - , bore x stroke: 
* &quot;D&quot; indicates a dual overhead cam as opposed to a single overhead cam
* &quot;E&quot; indicates the individual engine ports are electronically fuel-injected &#x27;single-cam&#x27;
* &quot;S&quot; indicates the engine is carbureted
* &quot;T&quot; indicates the engine has a factory installed turbocharger
* &quot;TT&quot; indicates the engine has factory installed twin turbochargers
* &quot;P&quot; indicates the engine runs on LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)

== RB20 (2.0L I6)==


The first RB20ET/DE/DET engines were fitted to the HR31 Skyline and the Nissan Fairlady 200ZR (Z31 chassis), produced from August 1985. The early twin cam engines featured the NICS (Nissan Induction Control System) injection system, while the later twin cam engines used ECCS (Electronic Concentrated Control System). Later versions which used ECCS engine management, discarded the twelve tiny runners for six much larger ones (though they retained twelve ports on the head, so there was a splitter plate). It was also fitted to the A31 Cefiro, C32 and C33 Laurel. The Fairlady 200ZR was fitted with an intercooled NICS type RB20DET.

The first RB20E engine was used in the C32 Nissan Laurel, produced from October 1984.

Laurels, R32 Skyline and Cefiros used the second (1989–1993) series RB20E/DE/DET. This had an improved head design, and used the ECCS injection system. These later motors are known as &quot;Silver Top&quot; engines.

The RB20DET-R was used in the Nissan Skyline 2000GTS-R (HR31) and was limited to 800 units.

There were a variety of 2.0 L RB20 engines produced:
*RB20E
*:single-cam
*:Power: at 5600 rpm
*:Torque: at 4000–4400 rpm
*:Camshaft duration: 232° intake; 240° exhaust

==RB24S (2.4L I6)==

This is a comparatively rare engine, as it was not produced for the Japanese domestic market. These were fitted to some left hand drive Nissan Cefiros exported from Japan new. Mechanically, the RB24S combines an RB30E head, RB25DE/DET block and RB20DE/DET crank with 34 mm height pistons. The resulting bore and stroke combined to form a inline-six engine.

This engine used carburetors instead of the Nissan ECCS fuel injection system. It is able to rev higher than the RB25DE/DET (as it has the same stroke as the RB20DE/DET) as well as being almost the same displacement as the RB25DE/DET. A common modification is to fit a twin cam head from other RB series motors while retaining the carburetor set-up. The standard single cam form produced at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 3,000 rpm.

==RB25 (2.5L I6)==


The RB25 series of engines was first introduced in the R32 Nissan Skyline GTS25 sedan and coupe models in 1991. The RB25DE (naturally aspirated) and DET (turbocharged) variants produced from August 1993 also featured NVCS (Nissan Variable Cam System) for the intake cam. This gave the new RB25DE more power and torque at lower rpm than the previous model. From 1995 (series 2 engines), both the RB25DE and RB25DET had a revised electrical system and the turbocharger on the RB25DET(S2) had a ceramic turbine wheel rather than aluminium. The most obvious change to the system was the introduction of ignition coils with built in ignitors, therefore the coil ignitor that was on previous models was not used. Other changes were a different air flow meter, ECU, cam angle sensor and throttle position sensor. Mechanically the series 1 and 2 are very similar, the only mechanical difference would be the camshafts as the series 2 cam angle sensor&#x27;s shaft that goes into the exhaust cam is slightly different. Early series 2 featured the traditional Mitsubishi CAS which was later swapped for the Black Hitachi CAS which used a grooved shaft because of a half circle positioning tooth which occasionally broke off when removing CAS.

In May 1998 a NEO head was fitted, which enabled the engine to be classified as a low emission vehicle (LEV) engine due to their lower fuel consumption and emission output. The NEO head featured solid lifters (needing adjustment over time) rather than hydraulic (self adjusting), revised camshafts (higher lift lower duration to complement smaller ports and torque), with on/off solenoid variable VCT, used a hotter thermostat, model-specific coil packs and a revised inlet manifold (the runner diameter is reduced from to increase air velocity and low end torque) in particular the RB25DE NEO which had two inlets going into the inlet manifold. The combustion chamber of the head is smaller so model-specific pistons are used to compensate. The turbo received the larger OP6 turbine wheel, while some came with an aluminium compressor and super alloy turbine wheels, others had the nylon plastic compressor wheel and ceramic turbine wheel. Turbo engines were upgraded to use GT-R spec connecting rods. Some also used an N1 type oil pump and had the oil pump drive collar on the crank revised to help cope with the breakage problems associated with fast, high revs.
All in all they are quite a different engine in their own right — a culmination of 20 years of Nissan RB engine building rolled into one.

The non-VCT, non-turbo RB25DE was fitted to the R32 Skyline, the VCT turbo and non-turbo was fitted to R33 Skylines and the WNC34 Stagea and the Laurel C34. R34 Skyline, C35 Laurel and later Stagea (WGNC34) models use the NEO RB.

The 2.5 L RB25 engine was produced in four different forms:

*RB25DE
*:twin-cam, non-turbo with 10:1 compression ratio
*:Power: at 6000 rpm
*:Torque: at 4000 rpm
*RB25DET
*:twin-cam, turbocharged (T3 Turbo) with 9:1 compression ratio
*:Power: 
*:Torque: 
*RB25DE NEO
*:twin-cam, non-turbo with 10:1 compression ratio
*:Power: at 6000 rpm
*:Torque: at 4000 rpm
*RB25DET NEO
*:twin-cam, turbocharged (T3 Turbo, &quot;45V3&quot; with OP-6 compressor) with 9:1 compression ratio
*:Power: at 6400 rpm
*:Torque: at 3200 rpm)

==RB26 (2.6L I6)==
===RB26DE===
The RB26DE is a naturally aspirated variant of the RB26DETT made specifically for the 1992 Nissan Skyline Autech Version GTS-4 (HNR32) sedan. Mechanically, it is similar to the RB26DETT as it uses the same cylinder head, bore and stroke () and individual intakes as the RB26DETT, minus the usage of a parallel twin-turbo system. The engine and ECU (engine control unit) were tuned by Autech and S&amp;S Engineering to make at 6,800rpm and at 5,200rpm. It also has a higher compression ratio than the RB26DETT, at 10.5:1.

===RB26DETT===

The RB26DETT engine is a twin-turbo inline-six engine manufactured by Nissan, for use in the 1989-2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R. The RB26DETT engine block is made from cast iron, while the cylinder head is made from aluminium alloy, which contains DOHC 4 valves per cylinder (24 valves in total) setup. The intake of the RB26DETT varies from other RB-series motors in that it has six individual (3 sets of 2 throttle assemblies that are siamesed together) instead of a single throttle body. The engine also uses a parallel twin-turbo system, using a pair of T25-type ceramic turbochargers set by the wastegates to limit boost pressure to , although the Skyline GT-R has a built in boost restrictor to keep boost under .

The first 2.6 L RB26DETT was rated by Nissan at around at 6,800 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. By the end of production, power levels had gone up to around at 6,800 rpm and at 4,400 rpm, not only because of developments and modifications to the engine, but also because of the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement&quot; made between automakers at the time to limit the &quot;advertised&quot; horsepower of any vehicle to . While the published figures from Nissan were as quoted above, it has been known among enthusiasts that the car actually had a factory power output closer to the figure. The RB26 is widely known and became quite popular for its strength and power potential thanks to its iron block and forged internals, making it a modification friendly platform for tuners and aftermarket modifications in general.
Some factory features of the RB26DETT:
* 6 throttle body intake
* Solid lifter valve actuation, shim under bucket
* Belt driven cams
* CAS (crank angle sensor) driven off exhaust cam, tells ECU (engine control unit) crank/cam position 
* water cooled, oil pressure lubed turbos
* OEM cast pistons have cooling channels under the crowns (extra oil cooling to keep piston temperatures down)
* Piston oil squirters
* Sodium filled exhaust valves
* 8 Counter weighted crankshaft
* &#x27;I&#x27; beam connecting rods

There is a common oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the crankshaft meets the oil pump was machined too small, eventually leading to oil pump failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider oil pump drive, which is found in all R33+ RB26 motors. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make oil pump extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who moves away from the OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the oil pump gears in the same way as the Toyota&#x27;s 1JZ-GTE engine found in the Toyota Supra (MK3). This kit is available for most uprated RB26 oil pumps including Nissan&#x27;s own OEM, N1 and Nismo parts, although most high HP RB-series engines all over the world have been proven to be reliable without spline driven oil pumps when built and tuned correctly.

Besides minor cosmetic updates and ECU fine tunings, changes were made in the R34 generation to ball bearing T28 turbochargers as opposed to journal bearing turbos. The R34 GT-R turbos retained the ceramic exhaust turbine wheel. Models that had steel exhaust turbine wheels included the R32 Nismo, R32-R33-R34 N1 models and R34 Nür spec skyline GT-R&#x27;s.

R34 GT-R model RB26DETT engine specific differences to the R32-R33 engines include:
* Candy red cam/coil pack covers
* Different coil cover emblem
* Plastic CAM gear cover
* Non-painted inlet plenum (apparently also a lighter casting)
* Hitachi CAS (Crank angle sensor) has different drive fitting compared to earlier R32-R33 exhaust cams
* Igniter built into coil packs (no igniter pack on the rear of coil cover)
* Ball bearing turbochargers with ceramic exhaust turbine wheels
* Stainless steel dump pipes
* Sump front differential has a different ratio (3:55)
* Different diameter coolant/heater pipes on intake side of block
* Dual mass flywheel

Originally, the R32 GT-R was planned to have the 2.4 L RB24DETT and compete in the 4000 cc class (in Group A rules, the displacement is multiplied by 1.7 if the engine is turbocharged). This was at a time when Nismo was going through the process of designing the R32 GT-R to be a Group A race car. However, when the engineers added the AWD system, they found that it made the car heavier than expected and as a result, much less competitive. Nismo made the decision to make the engine a 2.6 L twin-turbo and compete in the higher 4500 cc class, resulting in the RB26DETT engine many known today.

The RB26DETT was used in the following vehicles:
* Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR32
* Nissan Skyline GT-R BCNR33
* Nissan Skyline GT-R Autech Version 40th Anniversary BCNR33 (Autech factory-installed RB26DETT and AWD 5spd transmission in R33 sedan chassis)
* Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR34
*Nissan Stagea 260RS WGNC34改 (RS4 chassis used)
* Tommykaira ZZII (concept car) 

===RB26DETT N1===
The RB26DETT N1 is a modified version of the RB26DETT engine, developed by Nismo (Nissan Motorsports) for Group A and Group N motorsport. Nismo found that the standard RB26DETT engine required too much maintenance for use in a Group-A or Group-N race car and subsequently designed the N1 block; this was first used in Bathurst, Australia. Nismo balanced the crankshaft to a higher specification than stock, as the standard RB26DETT engine experiences vibrations between 7,000 and 8,000 rpm. The engine also received improved water and oil channels within the engine block. The pistons and top piston rings were also upgraded to . The N1 engine also has upgraded camshafts and upgraded turbochargers.

Although all versions of the RB26DETT N1 engine use Garrett T25 turbochargers, the specification of the turbochargers changed through the 3 generations of the RB26DETT N1 engine (R32, R33, and R34). The R32, and R33 versions used Journal Bearing T25 Turbochargers. The R34 RB26DETT N1 engine used Garrett GT25 turbo chargers (which use a set of ball bearings).

The biggest difference between the turbochargers used in the N1 engine, and the standard RB26DETT engine, is that the turbine wheels in the turbocharger are made from steel, rather than the ceramic used for the standard RB26DETT turbochargers. The ceramic turbine wheels are found to be very unreliable when used at high rotational speeds inducing higher centrifugal forces (such as when the turbochargers are used at a higher boost pressure than stock). With the advances in manufacturing technology such as sealing and material processes.

The Nismo RB26DETT N1 engine block uses an bore which can be bored up to either . The N1 block is cast with an identification mark of 24U, whereas the standard RB26DETT block is marked with 05U. The RB26DETT N1 block is compatible with all GT-R engine bays.

===RB26DETT Z1 and Z2===
The RB26DETT Z1 and Z2 (and often referred to as an &quot;RB28DETT Z1/Z2&quot;) was the engine used in the Nissan Skyline GT-R Z-Tune built by Nismo. It uses a stronger RB26 block based on Nissan&#x27;s Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing vehicles (stamped with RRR), stroked crankshaft, upgraded turbochargers, and a higher bore and stroke at a displacement of 2.8 L. It produces and of torque. The &#x27;Z2&#x27; revision includes upgraded turbochargers supplied by IHI, and additional improvements to allow it to reach maximum RPM speeds of up to 8,000 rpm.

==RB30 (3.0L I6)==
===RB30E/ET===

RB30 were produced from 1985–1991:
* RB30S GQ Patrol - carburetted single-cam at 4,800 rpm, at 3000 rpm
* Powertech 6Ei (RB30E) VL Commodore - fuel-injected single-cam at 5,200 rpm, at 3,600 rpm)
* RB30E R31 Skyline - fuel-injected single-cam at 5,200 rpm, at 3,600 rpm) Initially quoted as 117 kW, 252 N⋅m but later revised
* RB30E R31 Skyline GTS1 - fuel-injected single-cam at 5,500 rpm, at 3,900 rpm)
* RB30E R31 Skyline GTS2 - fuel-injected single-cam at 5,600 rpm, at 4,400 rpm)
* Powertech 6EiT (RB30ET) VL Commodore - fuel-injected single-cam turbo at 5,600 rpm, at 3,200 rpm)

This motor was produced for use in the Skylines, Patrols and rights bought by Holden because the Holden 202 (3.3 L) powering the Holden Commodore could no longer satisfy tightening emissions requirements, and with all new cars required to run on unleaded petrol by 1986 a quick replacement was needed. Nissan Motor Co. sold the RB30E to Holden for the VL Commodore. Holden would give the engine the name &#x27;Powertech 6Ei&#x27; and &#x27;Powertech 6EiT&#x27; (for turbocharged applications), although these names would only appear in official videos and brochures, seldom being used outside of Holden content. The radiator being a cross flow design and is fitted lower in relation to the engine in the VL, there is an increased likelihood of air locks forming in the (alloy) cylinder head if the correct bleeding procedure isn&#x27;t followed, causing this to overheat and warp. This was very unlikely in comparison to the R31 Skyline as the radiator is mounted higher. The engine proved to be very reliable apart from this issue. The RB30S was found in some Middle Eastern R31 Skylines and some GQ Nissan Patrols. The RB30E was found in R31 Skylines and VL Commodores in Australia as well as in South African R31 Skylines (with at 5,000 rpm and at 3,500 rpm)

The turbocharged RB30ET (producing ) was found only in the VL Commodore due to the conditions set out by Holden to Nissan in the contract to supply engines. It consists of a lower compression RB30E bottom end, more powerful oil pump, knock sensor, Garrett T3 turbocharger, injectors, different intake manifold and supporting ECU. The motor itself is still popular today in Australian and New Zealand motorsport and drag racing in VL Commodores, R31 Skylines and swaps in other vehicles.

Nissan Special Vehicles Division Australia produced two limited models of R31 Skylines, the GTS1 and GTS2. These contained slightly more powerful RB30E engines, containing longer opening duration cams and better flowing exhausts.
* GTS1 RB30E - injected single-cam at 5,500 rpm, at 3,500 rpm) - special cam profile, special exhaust
* GTS2 RB30E - injected single-cam at 5,600 rpm, at 4,400 rpm) - special cam profile, special exhaust, piggy back computer, valve porting

===RB30DE===
These rare engines were used in the Tommykaira M30 based on the R31 Skyline GTS and R32 Skyline GTSt. For the R31 M30, a modified RB20DE head was bolted onto the RB30E block. It delivered at 7000 rpm and at 4800 rpm.

For the R32 M30, the bore was enlarged to 87 mm and increased the displacement to 3030 cc. The head was also replaced with RB26DE head. This new version delivered at 7200 rpm and at 6100 rpm.

More commonly a hybrid conversion with an RB30E block and a twin cam RB25 head without a turbo is also used as a basis for the RB30DE.

===RB30DET===
Nissan did not produce this engine. It refers to a turbocharged engine using an RB30E short block with the twin-cam head installed from another RB series engine. A common hybrid in Australia and New Zealand (referred to as the RB25/30 or RB26/30) uses an RB30E bottom end mated to a RB25DE, RB25DET or RB26DETT cylinder head and turbo (RB20DE and DET heads are not used as the bores are different in size (RB30 RB20 ); but were originally modified and used on the Tommykaira RB30DE as the RB25 engine did not exist at the time). The RB25DE cylinder head from the A31 Cefiro C33 Laurel or R32 Skyline (aka: Non VCT) can be used. The RB25DET (from the R33 Skyline or C34 Laurel or Stagea) head is also used, however an external oil feed must be fabricated for the variable cam timing (VCT) on the RB25DET, and the oil galleries at the front of the engine are misaligned. The variable cam timing may be disconnected altogether. It may be necessary to reduce the size of the oil restrictors in the block and machine a full face oil pump drive collar onto the crank, (to prevent it shattering at high RPM), with the use of a twin cam oil pump.

The fitment of a twin cam head from any of these engines onto a standard compression RB30E bottom end gives a forced induction friendly compression ratio (around 8.2:1), for a mild to moderately modified street turbo engine, making the conversion popular amongst those who would otherwise convert their RB30E to a high compression RB30ET using original ET bolt on externals.

Although it has a larger displacement than the RB26DETT, maximum possible horsepower is less, as the RB30 block lacks the RB26 block&#x27;s internal bracing, and consequently cannot rev as high due to harmonic issues at ~7500 rpm. To compensate, the RB30DET produces more torque at lower revs due to its longer stroke. However they have been known to reach engine speeds up to 11,000 rpm with extensive balancing and blueprinting.

There is also an &#x27;RB30DETT&#x27; kit manufactured by OS Giken of Japan, which bolts an extension on top of the RB26 engine block, and fits liners, to give a bore and stroke of . It is available as an assembled short block, containing billet chrome-molybdenum crank, billet chrome-molybdenum H-beam connecting rods, forged pistons, and costs ¥1,500,000.

===RB-X GT2 and RB28DET (2.8L)===
The RB-X GT2 (designed and built by REINIK) is an engine specially made for the NISMO 400R. The difference between this engine and a RB26DETT is that the engine is bored and stroked which results in . The engine produces at 6800 rpm and at 4400 rpm.

This engine was manufactured with a reinforced cylinder block and cylinder head, metal head gasket, pistons with cooling channels, forged crank shaft, forged connecting rods, N1 turbine with reinforced actuator, high flow intake, stainless down pipe, and low exhaust resistant sport cats, most of which were not offered for the RB26DETT. RB-X GT2 engines competed in LeMans 24hr race, Pikes Peak, and other forms of motorsports. GT500 and Z-tune engines are also based on REINIK&#x27;s design although later built by NISMO&#x27;s Omori Factory.

REINIK also made over 20 RB28DET based on the R33 RB25DET. These engines were ordered by Prince Nissan Dealership network for a special edition R33 GT25t called 280 Type-MR. The engine was built for high torque and limited to and of torque.

==Stroker kits==
There are many stroker kits available for RB engines (some only available as proper kits while others being achievable by using cranks from other engines, for example a GT-R crank, pistons and rods in an RB25DET will make its displacement 2.6L as the bore is the same as an RB26DETT).

Achievable stroker displacements for RB engines:
*RB20 - 2.2, 2.4
*RB25 - 2.6, 2.7, 2.8
*RB26 - 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.15
*RB30 - 3.2 (Nitto), 3.3 (RIPS), 3.4 (Spool Imports)
*RB26 - 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. (Project RB)

<text>In rare cases, baseball games are forfeited, usually when a team is no longer able to play. Although not uncommon in baseball&#x27;s early days, forfeits are now rare. There have been only five forfeits in Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1954; the last forfeit was in 1995, and prior to that, 1979. Since 1914, there has only been one incident where a team deliberately made a decision to forfeit a game, by the 1977 Baltimore Orioles.

==Usage==
In the event of forfeiture in Major League Baseball (MLB), the score is recorded as 9–0, as stated in rule 2.00 of the &quot;Official Baseball Rules&quot; issued by the league. The 9–0 score equates to one run per each regulation game inning not played. Actual game statistics are recorded as they stand at the time of the forfeit; the game is recorded as a loss in the standings for the forfeiting team and a win for the other team, even if the forfeiting team is ahead at that point. Leagues with seven-inning games, such as high school baseball or softball, generally award a rule-based score of 7–0. The same is true for Little League Baseball, per Rule 2.00, under the definition of &quot;Forfeit&quot;, there is one run allocated per inning, resulting in scores of 6–0 or 7–0, depending on the division. If a game is already official (in an MLB game, this means if five innings were played, or innings if the home team is ahead) and the non-forfeiting team is ahead, then pitchers are credited for a win and loss using the same criteria as if the game were called for any other reason (such as weather); otherwise, no pitcher will be credited for a win, nor charged with a loss.

In college baseball, the NCAA has the authority to retroactively vacate results if the winning team is found to have violated NCAA rules; however although this is sometimes considered a retroactive &quot;forfeiture&quot; by fans and media, this is not actually the case, as for the losing team the loss is &quot;not&quot; retroactively changed to a win. The vacating of results is pursuant to a general NCAA rule that is not exclusive to baseball. In the NCAA, regardless of the sport, wins are usually vacated retroactively as a consequence of recruiting violations, if players or teams are caught violating the NCAA&#x27;s strict rules regarding amateurism or if one or more players are otherwise found to have been ineligible to play for some reason. Retroactive forfeiture can happen for Little League World Series games, and occurred following the and events, in both cases after the offending teams were found to have fielded players in violation of age or residency restrictions.

== MLB forfeits ==
===Before 1960===
In the early days of the major leagues, forfeits were not rare. In 1871, six games were forfeited in two months. There was at least one forfeit almost every year from 1882 until 1909. 1884 saw forfeits in the double digits, many because one team failed to appear for a game or refused to continue playing. Game 2 of the 1885 World Series was forfeited when St. Louis pulled its team from the field to protest the umpiring. There were five forfeits in the National League in 1886.

Sometimes teams would forfeit games if they lacked enough players to take the field. During the 19th century, major league club rosters were typically much smaller than today since owners were often reluctant to spend more than absolutely necessary on payroll. Moreover, the fastest means of communication and transportation between cities was telegraph and railroad respectively, thus teams often could not replace players who became unavailable for whatever reason for several days. In addition, prior to the 20th century it was not uncommon for businessmen to outright own more than one team (or at least to have financial interests in multiple teams), obvious conflicts of interest that would later be prohibited. Often, such owners would unscrupulously transfer players from a weaker team to a stronger one, sometimes without regard to whether the weaker team would have enough players to play upcoming games. Particularly if the team was also floundering at the gate, ownership interests sometimes disregarded such considerations and forfeited one or more game(s).

The high rate of forfeits slowed after 1910, with one forfeit every few years. Game 7 of the 1934 World Series was in jeopardy of being forfeited when Detroit Tigers fans began showering the outfield with debris after St. Louis Cardinals left fielder Joe Medwick slid hard into Tigers third baseman Marv Owen. A potential blemish to the Series was averted when Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered both Medwick and Owen replaced in the one-sided game.

In games that were played before the advent of stadium lighting (and/or were subject to a relatively early curfew), forfeits were also sometimes declared as a result of a team&#x27;s stalling tactics. A baseball game scheduled for nine innings is not official until five innings have been completed, or innings if the home team is winning. Consequently, a team that was behind by a considerable number of runs before the end of the fifth inning might deliberately slow down the game, in the hopes that darkness or the curfew would come before the game was declared official—this was because for most of baseball history, games ended before becoming official were re-played from the beginning at a later date. Such deliberate attempts to slow down play are subject to a forfeiture being declared. The last such major-league incident took place in 1954. On July 18, the visiting Philadelphia Phillies were leading the hometown St. Louis Cardinals, 8–1, in the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader. With darkness approaching and the game not yet official, Cardinals manager Eddie Stanky brought in three new pitchers in the inning. Umpire Babe Pinelli, citing an unnecessary delay of the game on the part of the Cardinals, forfeited the game to the Phillies. Starting with the 2020 season, MLB now more broadly uses suspended games, to avoid re-playing games from the beginning.

There are three known instances when MLB games were initially ruled a forfeit by umpires but the ruling was later overturned. Each occurred in the latter part of the season, in 1913 (later played to completion), in 1918 (doubleheader left unplayed), and in 1939 (set to be played to completion, but rained out and left as a tie). None had an effect on the postseason.

===Since 1960===
Forfeits have become extremely rare in MLB. The advent of night baseball eliminated the use of stalling tactics to beat the sunset, and any curfews still in force are much more lenient than in the past (for example, only prohibiting innings from starting after 1 am, long after a game is likely to be official). In the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a more stringent curfew in a city scheduled to host MLB games (such as the 1989 World Series earthquake), it is extremely unlikely that MLB would allow the game(s) to be played. In such cases, MLB typically reschedules the game(s) or moves the game(s) to the opponents&#x27; stadium or a neutral venue. In one exceptional case, when the 2015 Baltimore protests caused local authorities to impose a curfew, MLB satisfied the terms of the curfew by ordering the affected game to be played earlier in the day and without spectators.

Finally, major league rosters today are of a standard size with ample personnel to replace sick or injured players, and the modern minor league farm system as well as modern transportation and communication infrastructure allows teams to rapidly replace players unavailable for a longer period, meaning it is extremely unlikely that a team would be unable to play a game due to lack of players. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when teams occasionally had multiple players unable to play without warning, MLB opted for a policy of rescheduling games rather than forcing affected teams to forfeit.

Of the five forfeits that have occurred in the expansion era of baseball (post-1960), all but one have been the result of fans disrupting the game to a point where the stadium staff cannot control them, at which point the home team is forced to forfeit.

* Washington Senators&#x27; final game at RFK Stadium: On September 30, 1971, the home team led the New York Yankees by 7–5 with two outs in the top of the ninth inning. Senators fans were angered by the team&#x27;s impending move to Dallas–Fort Worth, where the Senators were to become the Texas Rangers in 1972. Apparently unaware that there was one out left in the game, spectators began to storm the field and vandalize the stadium. With no prospect of order being restored after the security staff had simply left during the game, resulting in thousands of people walking in without paying, the umpires forfeited the game to the Yankees.
* Ten Cent Beer Night: A promotion held by the Cleveland Indians on June 4, 1974, backfired when intoxicated Cleveland fans ran onto the field and attacked Texas Rangers outfielder Jeff Burroughs with the score tied 5–5 in the ninth inning. This led to a riot in which the drunk and rowdy fans, armed with an array of improvised weapons and various other objects, including chunks of the stadium seating, ed with players and officials from both teams as well as with the umpires, who subsequently forfeited the game to Texas.
* During the September 15, 1977, game between the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium, the grounds crew placed a tarpaulin over the two mounds in the Blue Jays&#x27; bullpen, which was in foul territory, outside the left field foul line after light rain. Before the start of the bottom of the fifth inning (with the Blue Jays leading 4–0), Orioles manager Earl Weaver came out of the dugout and claimed to umpire Marty Springstead that the tarp endangered his players by exposing them to the risk that they could slip or trip on it when entering the bullpen to catch a fly ball; Weaver ordered his team from the field, and said that they would not return until the tarp was removed. Springstead ordered the tarp removed from the mound that was closest to fair territory, but not the tarp from the other mound, and told Weaver that he could play the game under protest. After arguing with Springstead for nearly 20 minutes, Weaver returned to the dugout. Springstead then waited five minutes (the period of time specified by the rule book) for the Orioles to retake the field. When Weaver said they would not do so, Springstead ordered the game forfeited to the Blue Jays.
* Disco Demolition Night: On July 12, 1979, the Chicago White Sox held a promotion in which Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl came onto the field to blow up a box full of disco records between games of a doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. After the box was blown up, rowdy and intoxicated fans who had packed Comiskey Park beyond capacity stormed the field, engaged in various acts of vandalism and theft, and did not leave the field until Chicago police arrived in full riot gear. The field was so badly damaged that the umpires and managers decided the second game could not be played. American League president Lee MacPhail later forfeited the second game to the Tigers, ruling that the White Sox had failed to provide acceptable playing conditions.
* On August 10, 1995, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave out baseballs to paying customers as they entered the Dodger Stadium gates for a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Fans interrupted the game in the seventh inning when they threw these baseballs onto the field. In the eighth inning, Dodger first baseman Eric Karros was ejected for arguing balls and strikes, and in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the Cardinals leading 2–1, when the first Dodgers batter, Raúl Mondesí, was called out on strikes and ejected by home plate umpire Jim Quick for arguing, followed by Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda moments later for arguing with and abusing Quick. Dodger fans, fueled by a series of close calls, again threw their souvenir baseballs onto the field. The Cardinals left the field due to safety concerns, causing a several-minute delay, but when the Cardinals returned to the field, Dodgers fans threw more balls out of the center field bleachers, forcing the umpires to forfeit the game to St. Louis. As a result of this incident, MLB ruled that in any future promotional giveaways of baseballs or any other throwable object, the items would be given out as fans exited the stadium.

<doc id="994259" wikidata="Q445580" url="?curid=994259" title="Keratolytic">
<text>Keratolytic () therapy is a type of medical treatment to remove warts, calluses and other lesions in which the epidermis produces excess skin. In this therapy, acidic topical medicines, such as Whitfield&#x27;s ointment or Jessner&#x27;s solution, are applied to the lesion in order to thin the skin on and around it. This therapy causes the outer layer of the skin to loosen and shed.

Keratolytics can also be used to soften keratin, a major component of the skin. This serves to improve the skin&#x27;s moisture binding capacity, which is beneficial in the treatment of dry skin. Such agents (keratolytics) include alkalis (by swelling and hydrolysis of skin), salicylic acid, urea, lactic acid, allantoin, glycolic acid, and trichloroacetic acid.

While cytostatic agents such as zinc pyrithione are first line, keratolytics (salicylic acid and sulfur) can also be used in the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.

Sulfur and salicylic acid can also be used to effectively treat acne and cradle cap in some patients. Resorcinol is another keratolytic that is usually combined with sulfur. Urea acts as a keratolytic due to its hygroscopic property.

<doc id="994264" wikidata="Q721668" url="?curid=994264" title="Professional wrestling aerial techniques">
<text>Aerial techniques, also known as &quot;high-flying moves&quot; are performance techniques used in professional wrestling for simulated assault on opponents. The techniques involve jumping from the ring&#x27;s posts and ropes, demonstrating the speed and agility of smaller, nimble and acrobatically inclined wrestlers, with many preferring this style instead of throwing or locking the opponent. 

Aerial techniques can be challenging for wrestlers to learn since they learn to trust the other performer, the nominal opponent, to either target the jump correctly or to safely catch their fall. Due to the risk of injury caused by these high-risk moves, some promotions have banned the use of some of them. 

The next list of maneuvers was made under general categories whenever possible.

==Attacks==

=== 187 ===

====Diving headbutt====
Also known as a Diving headbutt drop or a Flying headbutt, it is delivered from the turnbuckle with the wrestler leaping forward into the air head-first to fall and strike anywhere on the opponent&#x27;s prone or supine body. The move was accidentally invented by Harley Race, who adapted it as a signature move and it was then further popularized by The Dynamite Kid, Chris Benoit, Bam Bam Bigelow, D-Von Dudley, Tomoaki Honma and recently Bryan Danielson and Chad Gable. The wrestler will sometimes use this move with a swan diving motion by spreading their arms outwards while arching their legs backwards midair while performing the move. Benoit and Danielson are best known to use this technique. Benoit also used a version of this move by simply falling forward off the turnbuckle, with his arms spread up and outwards, to hit an opponent at close range. Honma also uses this version that he calls the &quot;Kokeshi&quot; while keeping his arms to his sides. This move, popular in lucha libre, can also be used to hit a standing opponent as demonstrated by Rey Mysterio who has used diving and springboard versions of this move earlier, and rarely at later parts in his career, as a signature and finisher. It was later publicized that the move in general could cause severe spine, brain, leg or chest damage.

====Diving knee drop====
A move in which a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle, top rope, or the apron, landing one knee across a supine opponent. There is also a variation where a wrestler jumps from the elevated position and lands both knees across the supine opponent, referred to as a &quot;diving double knee drop&quot;.

Springboard, slingshot, and standing or running versions of this move are also possible with the latter being used while the attacker is charging towards an opponent, against a charging opponent, or a combination of both. Innovated by CIMA, who has used both a springboard and top rope version as finishing maneuvers in Dragon Gate, and named it after the Greek landmark where he proposed to his wife. American wrestlers Sasha Banks and Matt Sydal also use it as a signature move, the latter having also performed in Dragon Gate.

=====Shooting star knee drop=====
This move sees the wrestler jumping forward from the second turnbuckle, executing a mid-air backflip, landing knee first on an opponent down all on fours. It is a finishing move used by &quot;Speedball&quot; Mike Bailey as &quot;Ultima Weapon&quot;.

This can also be performed onto an opponent prone or supine on the mat. 

A variation of this move known as the &quot;Banzai Drop&quot;, popularized by Yokozuna and by Rikishi as the &quot;Rump Shaker&quot;, sees the wrestler standing over a fallen opponent next to the turnbuckle, then climbing up to the second rope and jumping down, landing on the opponent&#x27;s stomach or chest.

=====Molly-Go-Round=====

=====Rolling senton bomb=====
Another variant where the attacking wrestler, facing away from the ring, does a 180° twist followed by the senton bomb. This was popularised by Jeff Hardy calling it &quot;Whisper in the Wind&quot;. This can be done with the opponent standing up or laying. Matt Riddle is also a notable user of this move, who calls it the &quot;Floating Bro&quot;.

====Shooting star senton====
Jumping forward from an elevated position, the attacking wrestler executes a mid-air backflip ending in a senton.

This basic maneuver involves a wrestler jumping forward from a raised platform, landing stomach first horizontally across an opponent lying on the ground below. This move was popularized by Jimmy Snuka, naming it the &quot;Superfly Splash&quot;, for his “Superfly” gimmick, and is currently used by his daughter Tamina Snuka as a tribute to her father. The Usos also use this move as their finishers called the &quot;Uso Splash&quot;, and is also occasionally used by Solo Sikoa called &quot;Flying Solo&quot;. Bronson Reed also uses this as a finishing move called the &quot;Tsunami&quot;.

====450° splash====
Also known as &quot;firebird splash&quot;, involves an attacker facing the ring from the top of the turnbuckles, then performing a &quot;Rudolph&quot; (front somersault with 1 twists) to land the upper body&#x27;s front on the opponent. This move was innovated by Japanese superstar Hayabusa, hence why it is also called the &quot;Firebird Splash&quot;. Scott Steiner introduced the move in 1987 before 2 Cold Scorpio popularized the move in the 1990s. It can also be dangerous when it cannot be executed properly, as WWE previously banned it in 2005 after Juventud Guerrera broke Paul London&#x27;s face before they allowed Justin Gabriel to use it in 2010. It is often used by high-flying wrestlers, but has also been used by mat-based wrestler Kris Statlander as her finisher, which is dubbed the &quot;Friday Night Fever&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Area 451&quot;).

=====Corkscrew 450° splash=====
The move was innovated and popularized by Hayabusa, who named it the &quot;Phoenix splash&quot;. The wrestler facing away from the ring on the top turnbuckle performs a 180° turn in mid-air while performing a 450° splash onto a lying opponent. Kota Ibushi, Rich Swann as well as Pac are other notable users of the move, the latter referring to the move as the &quot;Black Arrow&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Red Arrow&quot; during his tenure in WWE as Adrian Neville and Neville).

=====Imploding 450° splash=====
Also known as &quot;flaming star press&quot; or &quot;inverted / reverse 450° splash&quot;, sees the attacking wrestler standing on the top turnbuckle facing away from the ring. Then jumping backwards executing a 450° splash inwards (facing the turnbuckle) onto a downed opponent on the mat. Mustafa Ali once used this move, naming it the &quot;054&quot;.

=====Imploding corkscrew 450° splash=====
The attacking wrestler stands on the top turnbuckle facing towards the ring and performs a 180° turn in mid-air while performing a 450° splash inwards.

====Corner slingshot splash====
The wrestler places the opponent lying supine perpendicular to the turnbuckle. Then approaching to the turnbuckle in the same corner, grabbing a hold both hands on the top rope and climbing to the first or second rope, the wrestler bounces on the ropes before throwing both legs backwards and placing the body parallel to the mat as releasing the ropes, thus falling inwards and downwards to the ring squashing and pinning the opponent. Often referred to as &quot;Vader Bomb&quot;, for it was (Big Van) Vader who popularized it. Jack Swagger used a running variation as his signature in WWE, calling it a &quot;Swagger Bomb&quot; and is currently being used by Otis as the &quot;Dozer splash&quot;.

===Moonsault===
A wrestler executes a backflip and lands torso first on the opponent. A basic moonsault is generally attempted from the top turnbuckle, though myriad variations exist.

====Diving crossbody====
To perform the move, the wrestler jumps from an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle) onto an opponent, landing horizontally across the opponent&#x27;s torso, forcing them to the mat and usually resulting in a pinfall attempt. There is also a reversed version, called a &quot;reverse crossbody&quot;, where the wrestler faces away from the prone opponent before executing the maneuver. This move is one of the basic moves of lightweight wrestlers. This move was made famous as the finisher of WWE Hall of Famer Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat. The Hurricane used diving crossbody as his finisher and named it the &quot;Cape&quot;.

====Frog splash====
This move is performed by leaping from the top rope, stretching out to a horizontal position, and bringing one&#x27;s feet and hands inward and outward before landing.

Eddie Guerrero made the frog splash famous in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. However, the move itself was innovated by La Fiera in Mexico in the early 1980s. Later it was used by Art Barr in the late 1980s and was named by 2 Cold Scorpio who remarked Barr looked &quot;like a frog&quot; whilst performing the move which resulted in Barr naming it. After Barr&#x27;s death in 1994, Guerrero used the move in tribute to his fallen tag team partner. After Guerrero&#x27;s death in 2005, Christian Cage began using the move as a tribute to Guerrero. The legendary Hiroshi Tanahashi uses this move as &quot;High Fly Flow&quot;. T.J. Perkins uses this move since 2020 and calls it the &quot;Mamba Splash&quot; in honor of the late basketball player Kobe Bryant, of whom Perkins is a fan. Cedric Alexander uses this as one of his finishing moves, called &quot;Overtime&quot;.

There is a high-angle turning variation named the &quot;Five-Star Frog Splash&quot; where the opponent is not placed perpendicular to the corner. Instead, the attacker turns mid-air to land on the opponent in the splash position, regardless of which direction the opponent is lying in. It was made famous by ECW, WWF/E and TNA superstar Rob Van Dam as it was used as his finisher. He also uses a regular version, generally going halfway or more than halfway across the ring to hit his opponent. Lio Rush uses a split-legged version called the &quot;Final Hour&quot;. The split-legged version was popularized by D&#x27;Lo Brown, who dubbed his version the &quot;Lo Down&quot;. Montez Ford uses a spinning version of this move called &quot;From the Heavens&quot;, as well as Mike Santana, who calls the move the &quot;Puppy Splash&quot;.

===Diving stomp===

The wrestler jumps down from a raised platform onto an opponent, dropping one foot onto the opponent&#x27;s body. A variation known as a &quot;diving double foot stomp&quot; sees the attacking wrestler jumping down from a raised platform on an opponent, driving both feet into the opponent. Finn Balor uses this as his finishing move called the &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot;. Cameron Grimes uses a running variation of this move called the &quot;Cave-In&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Caveman Stomp&quot;. Swerve Strickland uses a variant where he stomps an opponent on a seated position called &quot;Swerve Stomp&quot;.

====Moonsault double foot stomp====
Also known as the &quot;Moonstomp&quot;, this variation sees the wrestler perform a moonsault, but instead of landing on a fallen opponent in the splash position, the wrestler continues the rotation driving both feet into the opponent. Innovated by Hikari Fuokoka while Sonjay Dutt and IYO SKY occasionally use this as an finishing move.

====Mushroom stomp====
While situated on the middle turnbuckle, a wrestler jumps over a charging opponent, driving one or both feet into the opponent&#x27;s back, pushing the opponent into the turnbuckle or down to the ground, before landing on their feet. The technique&#x27;s name is a reference to the stomping attacks used by video game character Mario.

===Flying body press===
Differentiating themselves from a splash or a senton, these maneuvers are performed from an upright position, using momentum and weight to run over a standing opponent or pin a fallen one.

====Falling Thesz press====
Sitting on the top turnbuckle, the attacking wrestler rests both feet with spread legs on the second ropes waiting for an incoming opponent, then jumps forward through springboarding to sit on the opponent&#x27;s midsection as in a standing Thesz press.

====Shooting star press====
A technique invented by Jushin Thunder Liger. The wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position and presses their knees to their own chest, executes a backflip and lands on the opponent as if performing a body press. This move was used by Brock Lesnar and is Matt Sydal&#x27;s finisher, but was popularized by Billy Kidman in WCW. The move was previously banned in WWE in 2005 for safety reasons, as the move can easily be botched and cause serious injuries, much like the piledriver. Mark Andrews of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) uses this as a high-flying move called &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;.

=====Corkscrew shooting star press=====
This move sees a wrestler jump forward while twisting 360° and performing a backflip. This move is used and has been popularized by PAC who called it the &quot;Red Arrow&quot;, and later the &quot;Black Arrow&quot;. It is also known for being used by Will Ospreay and Komander.

===Flying kicks===
Several attacks taken from eastern martial arts to &quot;Lucha libre&quot;, these are widely popular maneuvers amongst fans worldwide.

====Diving calf kick====
Standing over the top turnbuckle or top rope, the attacking wrestler jumps off and twists slightly so as soaring midair faces away from the opponent, connecting the side of their lead leg&#x27;s calf-heel cord area to the opponent&#x27;s face or chest.

====Missile dropkick====
A move in which the wrestler jumps from an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle) and strikes a standing opponent with the soles of both feet, essentially executive a diving version of a dropkick. Shane McMahon uses a variation where he leaps from the one corner of the ring to the adjacent side before executing the maneuver to the cornered opponent, naming it the &quot;Coast-to-Coast&quot;.

==Throws==

===Diamond dust===
This maneuver is performed by an attacking wrestler standing or sitting on an elevated platform facing the back of a standing opponent while applying an inverted facelock. From this position, the attacking wrestler somersaults forward to roll the inverted facelock into a facelock. As they fall, the wrestler either drops to a seated position driving the opponent&#x27;s jaw into their shoulder, or back-first forcing the opponent&#x27;s face into the mat. Innovated by Masato Tanaka.

===Diving hurricanrana===
This move is executed by jumping forward off the top rope with legs apart, then straddling on a standing opponent&#x27;s shoulders and using the momentum to snap off, rolling and throwing the opponent forward. This move was popularized by Lita as the &quot;Litacanrana&quot;. Rey Mysterio popularized a springboard version called the &quot;West Coast Pop&quot;, but rarely uses it in his later years due to knee injuries.


====Frankensteiner====
This variant is executed on an opponent sitting on the top turnbuckle. With the attacking wrestler&#x27;s legs scissored around the opponent&#x27;s head while they face each other, the wrestler backflips to swing through the opponent&#x27;s open legs, dragging the opponent into a forced somersault that distances the wrestler from the opponent, who lands back-first. The name comes from Scott Steiner, who possibly invented the move.

A handstand variation can also be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handspring on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping both shins or feet around the opponent&#x27;s neck. The wrestler then throws both legs forward towards the ring, pulling and flipping over the opponent to the mat back first.

Rey Mysterio and Último Dragón uses a spinning version of this move which sees the wrestling positioned on the top rope behind the opponent seated on the same top rope facing the ring inward. The wrestler then places themselves on both the opponents shoulders, spins around 180 degrees, and executes the backflip to land chest first to flip the opponent onto their back. Último Dragón uses this move as a finisher and calls it the &quot;Dragonsteiner&quot;.

=====Reverse Frankensteiner=====
Also known as &quot;Inverted Frankensteiner&quot; or &quot;Poisoned Frankensteiner&quot;, this is executed on an opponent sitting on the top turnbuckle. However, the opponent is facing away from the ring on the top turnbuckle thus the opponent backflips over and lands face first. This move can also be performed to the outside of the ring if the opponent is facing the inside of the ring or sitting on one edge of the corner turnbuckle facing the audience both legs outside of the ring on the same side. There is also a standing variation of this move in which the wrestler jumps onto the opponent&#x27;s shoulders from behind and then flips backwards driving the opponent&#x27;s head or chest onto the mat.

====Dragonrana====
In this variant the wrestler performs a front flip from the top rope before executing a true hurricanrana into a pin. The technique is named by and after Dragon Kid, who popularized the maneuver.

====Phoenixrana====
With this variant the wrestler, facing away from the ring and situated on the top turnbuckle, performs a 180° turn in mid-air and then performs a front flip before executing a pinning hurricanrana.

===Shiranui===

Invented by Naomichi Marufuji. A backflip inverted facelock drop where a wrestler puts the opponent into a facelock, then runs up the corner turnbuckles or ring ropes and jump backwards performing a backflip, and landing face down driving the opponent down to the mat back-first. Sometimes a standing variant is performed by wrestlers with adequate leaping ability or when assisted by a tag team partner. The move is popularly known, especially in North America, as &quot;Sliced Bread No. 2&quot;, a name created by wrestler Brian Kendrick. In a slight variation named &quot;sitout shiranui&quot; the wrestler lands into a seated position instead, driving the opponent&#x27;s head between the legs.

===Sunset flip===
A pinning move where wrestler and opponent face each other, with the wrestler on higher ground (such as the top turnbuckle). The wrestler dives over the opponent, catches them in a waistlock from behind, and rolls into a sitting position landing onto the mat. As the wrestler rolls over, the opponent is pulled over backwards, landing back first in a rana.

==Transition moves==
Some moves are meant neither to pin an opponent, nor weaken them or force them to submit, but intended to set up the attack on the opponent.

===Corkscrew===
The term implies adding a spiral resembling a corkscrew to a maneuver. It can also refer to the motion when a backflip is twisted around so the attacker faces the inside of the ring instead of the outside when the maneuver ends.

===Moonsault===

A wrestler executes a backflip and lands torso first on the opponent. A basic moonsault is generally attempted from the top turnbuckle, though myriad variations exist.

===Ropewalk===
As the name implies, this term is used to refer to any move which sees the attacking wrestler walking along the top rope before performing a move.

===Shooting star===
When a wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position and executes a mid-air backflip. Many techniques can be performed.

===Slingshot===
When a wrestler, standing on the ring apron, pulls on the top rope using the momentum to hurl over the ropes and into the ring. Alternatively, a wrestler may use the ropes to bounce the opponent off of them to power a throw or attack such as a powerbomb or a suplex.

===Somersault===
A simple front-flip used to modify an aerial technique. A corkscrew is often added to the somersault to further modify a move.

===Springboard===

When a wrestler using any of the ring ropes bounces upward. Most high-flying techniques can be performed after a spring board. Sometimes wrestlers will bounce off one set of ring ropes then off another to perform a move, this is referred to as a &quot;double springboard&quot;. A variation of a springboard is the rope run or climb, in which a wrestler runs up, effectively with one foot off each ring rope.

====Step-through====
A variation of the springboard, the wrestler starts by standing on the ring apron. As they start entering the ring, the wrestler springboards off of the bottom rope with one leg and performs a hold or attack on the opponent. The most common move performed out of the step-through is a tornado DDT, which Xavier Woods used for a brief time. It is also possible to perform it from the inside of the ring into the outside on an opponent on the apron or on the ground.

==Modifiers==

===Plancha===
An accepted term in American wrestling for a slingshot crossbody where the wrestler goes from the inside of the ring over the top ring rope to the outside. In &quot;lucha libre&quot;, this variant is often called a &quot;pescado&quot; (Spanish for &quot;fish&quot;) since a proper &quot;plancha&quot; is referring to any kind of crossbody. In America, however, a move from the top turnbuckle to a standing opponent on the outside where the chests impact each other is commonly referred to as such. It is also used to refer to any attack from the ring to the outside in which the wrestlers&#x27; chests impact each other. For example, a shooting star press to the outside onto a standing opponent is referred to as a &quot;shooting star plancha&quot;.

===Standing===
The term is used to refer to any move performed at the same level the opponent, usually right on the mat, rather than most aerial moves where the attacking wrestler performs them from a raised platform.

===Suicide===
Often occurring in Spanish as &quot;suicida&quot;, this term is placed before any move that goes from any of the ring parts to the outside of the ring. The most common example is the suicide dive known as &quot;topé suicida&quot; (Spanish for &quot;suicide headbutt&quot;).
When a somersault is performed after leaping through the ropes, or by jumping over the top rope, to land on the opponent back first, the move is known as a &quot;suicide senton&quot; or &quot;topé con giro&quot; (Sp. spinning headbutt). Outside Mexico, the move is incorrectly referred to as &quot;topé con hilo&quot;, for it was mistranslated in Japan (Since &quot;hilo&quot; in Spanish actually means &quot;thread&quot;) and the term has remained as such.

===Super===
This term (often exchanged for &quot;diving&quot;, &quot;elevated&quot;, &quot;top-rope&quot;, or &quot;avalanche&quot;) is placed before any move performed normally on the mat but when executed off the top or second rope.

===Topé===
A &quot;topé&quot; (from the original Spanish &quot;tope&quot;, meaning &quot;headbutt&quot;), like the plancha, is a move most often performed by jumping from the inside of the ring and out, but instead of going over the top rope, the &quot;topé&quot; is performed by leaping forward through the ropes in order to strike the opponent with the head. In Mexico, &quot;topé&quot; also refers to any variation of a battering ram.

<text>Marianne Cerilli (born 1961) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served as a New Democratic member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 until 2003, though she was not called to cabinet when the party formed government in 1999.

Cerilli was born in Toronto, raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba (from which she holds a B.P.E. and a Bachelor of Education degree). Before entering political life, she worked as a high school athletics coach, and was a counsellor in the Winnipeg School Division. She also worked at the &quot;Unemployed Health Centre&quot; of Winnipeg, and was a consultant to &quot;Manitoba Employment and Youth Services&quot; for three years.

==Political career==
Cerilli initially intended to run for the NDP in the centre Winnipeg riding of Broadway in the 1990 provincial election, but lost the party nomination to Conrad Santos by one vote. She instead ran in the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson, where she defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Thompson by almost 1,500 votes (incumbent Liberal MLA Allan Patterson finished third). The Progressive Conservatives won the general election, and Cerilli joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature.

Cerilli was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal challenger Art Miki by 4,891 votes to 2,401. The Progressive Conservatives won the general election again; during her time in opposition, Cerilli served as NDP critic for Housing, Workplace Safety, Health and Youth. She was regarded as one of the more left-wing members of caucus, and was the only Manitoba MLA to support Svend Robinson, rather than Lorne Nystrom, for the leadership of the federal NDP in 1995.

The NDP were victorious in the 1999 provincial election, and Cerilli personally defeated Progressive Conservative Henry McDonald by 5,198 votes to 3,114. She was not appointed to cabinet, but served as legislative assistant to the Minister of Family Services and Housing. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

Prior to the 2003 provincial election, she decided to leave her Radisson riding to run for the nomination in Wolseley. She lost the nomination to Rob Altemeyer, who served as an MLA until he retired in 2019. She now teaches part-time at the University of Winnipeg, and is operating a community development business.

On September 15, 2006, Cerilli officially registered as a candidate for Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in the 2006 municipal election, but came second to incumbent mayor Sam Katz.

<doc id="994284" wikidata="Q782979" url="?curid=994284" title="COMEFROM">
<text>In computer programming, COMEFROM (or COME FROM) is an obscure control flow structure used in some programming languages, originally as a joke. codice_1 is the inverse of codice_2 in that it can take the execution state from any arbitrary point in code to a codice_1 statement.

The point in code where the state transfer happens is usually given as a parameter to codice_1. Whether the transfer happens before or after the instruction at the specified transfer point depends on the language used. Depending on the language used, multiple codice_1s referencing the same departure point may be invalid, be non-deterministic, be executed in some sort of defined priority, or even induce parallel or otherwise concurrent execution as seen in Threaded Intercal.

A simple example of a &quot;codice_6&quot; statement is a label codice_7 (which does not need to be physically located anywhere near its corresponding codice_1) that acts as a &quot;trap door&quot;. When code execution reaches the label, control gets passed to the statement following the codice_1. This may also be conditional, passing control only if a condition is satisfied, analogous to a GOTO within an IF statement. The primary difference from GOTO is that GOTO only depends on the local structure of the code, while COMEFROM depends on the global structure – a GOTO transfers control when it reaches a line with a GOTO statement, while COMEFROM requires scanning the entire program or scope to see if any COMEFROM statements are in scope for the line, and then verifying if a condition is hit. The effect of this is primarily to make debugging (and understanding the control flow of the program) extremely difficult, since there is no indication near the line or label in question that control will mysteriously jump to another point of the program – one must study the entire program to see if any COMEFROM statements reference that line or label.

Debugger hooks can be used to implement a COMEFROM statement, as in the humorous Python goto module; see below. This also can be implemented with the gcc feature &quot;asm goto&quot; as used by the Linux kernel configuration option CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL. A no-op has its location stored, to be replaced by a jump to an executable fragment that at its end returns to the instruction after the no-op.

==History==
codice_1 was initially seen in lists of joke assembly language instructions (as &#x27;CMFRM&#x27;). It was elaborated upon in a Datamation article by R. Lawrence Clark in 1973, written in response to Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s letter &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;. COMEFROM was eventually implemented in the C-INTERCAL variant of the esoteric programming language INTERCAL along with the even more obscure &#x27;computed codice_1&#x27;. There were also Fortran proposals for &#x27;assigned codice_12&#x27; and a &#x27;codice_13&#x27; keyword (to complement the existing &#x27;codice_14&#x27; loop).

On 1 April 2004, Richie Hindle published an implementation of both codice_15 and codice_1 for the Python programming language. Despite being released on April Fools&#x27; Day and not being intended for serious use, the syntax is valid and the implementation fully works.

==Practical uses==

===Examples===
The following is an example of a program in a hypothetical BASIC dialect with &quot;codice_1&quot; instead of &quot;codice_15&quot;.

10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT &quot;WHAT IS YOUR NAME? &quot;; A$
30 PRINT &quot;HELLO, &quot;; A$
40 REM

This program (hypothetically) works by asking the user for their name, greeting them with the same name, and continuing all over again. The instruction &quot;codice_19&quot; on line 40 is simply a NOP (in this case, a REMark or comment) — the &quot;codice_1&quot; statement on line 10 causes a branch back to that line when execution reaches line 40, regardless of its contents.

A fully runnable example in Python with the joke codice_21 module installed (which uses debugger hooks to control program execution) looks like this:

from goto import comefrom, label

comefrom .repeat
name = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
if name:
 print(&quot;Hello&quot;, name)
 label .repeat
print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
This is an implementation in Ruby of the Intercal COME FROM statement.

$come_from_labels = {}

def label(l)
 if $come_from_labels[l]
 $come_from_labels[l].call
 end
end

def come_from(l)
 callcc do |block|
 $come_from_labels[l] = block
 end
end
=== OS/360 Fortran G ===
The OS/360 Fortran G compiler has a debug packet feature. Its &quot;AT&quot; statement is similar to COMEFROM in that it hands the control flow over to the debug block. Breakpoints in general are similar.

* Example 1: the values of SOLON, GFAR, and EWELL are examined as they were at the completion of statement 10. The AT statement indicates statement 11.

 INTEGER SOLON, GFAR, EWELL
 .
10 SOLON = GFAR * SQRT(FLOAT(EWELL))
11 IF (SOLON) 40, 50, 60
 .
 DEBUG UNIT(3)
 AT 11
 DISPLAY GFAR, SOLON, EWELL
 END

* Example 2: all the values of STOCK are displayed when statement 35 is encountered.

 DIMENSION STOCK(1000),OUT(1000)
 .
 DO 30 I=1, 1000
25 STOCK(I)=STOCK(I) - OUT(I)
30 CONTINUE
35 A = B + C
 .
 DEBUG UNIT(3)
 AT 35
 DISPLAY STOCK
 END

* Example 3: tracing begins at statement 10, at statement 20, tracing stops while the loop is executed, and resumes after the loop. Tracing stops just before statement 30 is executed.

10 A = 1.5
12 L = 1
15 B = A + 1.5
20 DO 22 I = 1,5
 .
22 CONTINUE
25 C = B + 3.16
30 D = C/2
 STOP
 .
 DEBUG UNIT(3), TRACE
C DEBUG PACKET NUMBER 1
 AT 10
 TRACE ON
C DEBUG PACKET NUMBER 2
 AT 20
 TRACE OFF
 DO 35 I = 1,3
 .
35 CONTINUE
 TRACE ON
C DEBUG PACKET NUMBER 3
 AT 30
 TRACE OFF
 END

<doc id="994292" wikidata="Q1748800" url="?curid=994292" title="Hogan's Alley (video game)">
<text>is a light gun shooter video game developed and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Family Computer in 1984 and then the arcade Nintendo VS. System and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. It was one of the first hit video games to use a light gun as an input device, along with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; (1984). The game presents players with &quot;cardboard cut-outs&quot; of gangsters and innocent civilians. The player must shoot the gangs and spare the innocent people. It was a major arcade hit in the United States and Europe.

The game is named after and based on Hogan&#x27;s Alley, a shooting range for law enforcement training somewhat similar in design to the city block rounds, first constructed at Camp Perry in Port Clinton, Ohio in the 1920s and later redesigned for use at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia in 1954. Three years after the release of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, a third rendition of the Hogan&#x27;s Alley range was constructed at the FBI Academy, resembling a small town, that is still used today.

==Gameplay==
The game begins with three cardboard cutouts moving into position against a blank wall and turning to face the player. The cutouts display a mixture of gangsters and innocent/friendly people; the player must react quickly and shoot only the gangsters. In later rounds, the backdrop changes from the blank wall to a city block, with some cutouts already exposed as they emerge into view. The player is confronted with five cutouts in each of these latter rounds.

After five rounds apiece in the wall and city block, a bonus round is played. Here, the player has a limited supply of ammunition with which to shoot up to ten tin cans thrown from one side of the screen, trying to bounce them onto ledges at the opposite side for points. After this round, the player returns to the wall rounds and the game continues at an increased speed.

Shooting an innocent person, or failing to shoot a gangster, costs the player one life, which is indicated by the &quot;MISS&quot; counter incrementing by one. No lives can be lost in the bonus round. When all lives are lost, indicated by the &quot;MISS&quot; counter reaching 10 or more, the game is over.

==Release==
The game is available on the Nintendo Entertainment System and as a Nintendo VS. System Game Pak, which was installed into VS. System Arcade cabinets.

In the United States, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 as one of the original 17 launch titles for the system. There are three modes: &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley A&quot; (the blank wall), &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley B&quot; (the town), and &quot;Trick Shot&quot; (shooting soda cans to bounce them onto ledges).

==Ports==
A modified version of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; using the Wii Remote in place of the NES Zapper was released for the Wii U Virtual Console on January 7, 2016 in North America.

==Reception==
In North America, the arcade version of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; became popular and popularized light gun video games along with &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; in 1985. In the United States, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; had topped the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts by November 1985 In Europe, it had also become a very popular arcade game by 1986.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade version a generally positive review, calling it &quot;a pleasant change&quot; from the space shooters popular in arcades at the time, but noted the gameplay is similar to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Bank Panic&quot; which released the same year and that it may not appeal to everyone. Mike Roberts and Eric Doyle of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, praising the realistic gun controller. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; as 1988&#x27;s Best Target Game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, calling it &quot;an entertaining variation on the theme&quot;.

==Legacy==
Digital artist Cory Arcangel hacked the &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; game to produce &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, an art piece that replaces the game&#x27;s targets with images of Andy Warhol. This is a reference to the film of the same name that dramatized Valerie Solanas&#x27;s attempted assassination of the artist.

&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;-inspired games appear in &quot;&quot; and other games in the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;, the &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; character has the ability to kick the can from the bonus rounds of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, which can be continually bounced forward by an off-screen shooter using the NES Zapper until it eventually explodes. The character&#x27;s Final Smash attack causes opponents to get caught in the middle of a shootout between the enemies from &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; and &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;.

<text>Burma Valley is a low-lying area on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, located southeast of the Bvumba Mountains. The main tarred road from Mutare leads through the mountains, reaching communal farmlands of Chigodora and then passes down into Burma Valley.

The valley is rainy and fertile and was used by European colonists for use as tobacco and fruit growing land. There are still a number of large commercial farms in the valley. During the independence war, a tarred road was built from Mutare into the valley for the easy movement of Rhodesian forces, who were helping to protect the farmers of the area.

More recently, some of the commercial farm land in the area has been re-allocated as part of the government&#x27;s land reform programme.

<text>In cultural anthropology and cultural geography, cultural diffusion, as conceptualized by Leo Frobenius in his 1897/98 publication &quot;Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis&quot;, is the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages—between individuals, whether within a single culture or from one culture to another. It is distinct from the diffusion of innovations within a specific culture. Examples of diffusion include the spread of the war chariot and iron smelting in ancient times, and the use of automobiles and Western business suits in the 20th century.

==Types==
Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined:
* Expansion diffusion: an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there, while also spreading outward to other areas. This can include hierarchical, stimulus, and contagious diffusion.
* Relocation diffusion: an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas, leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait.
* Hierarchical diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places, often with little regard to the distance between places, and often influenced by social elites.
* Contagious diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population with no regard for hierarchies. HIV/AIDS first spread to urban neighborhoods (Hierarchical diffusion) and then spread outwards (contagious diffusion)
* Stimulus diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept. Occurs when a certain idea is rejected but the underlying concept is adopted. Early Siberian people domesticated reindeer only after exposure to the domesticated cattle raised by cultures to their south. They had no use for cattle but the idea of domesticated herds appealed to them, and they began domesticating reindeer, an animal they had long hunted.

==Mechanisms==
Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways. Migrating populations will carry their culture with them. Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors, such as merchants, explorers, soldiers, diplomats, slaves, and hired artisans. Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or another inducement. Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed. Among literate societies, diffusion can occur through letters, books, and, in modern times, through electronic media.

There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms:
* Direct diffusion occurs when two cultures are very close to each other, resulting in intermarriage, trade, and even warfare. An example of direct diffusion is between the United States and Canada, where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey, which started in Canada, and baseball, which is popular in American culture.
* Forced diffusion occurs when one culture subjugates (conquers or enslaves) another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people. An example would be the forced Christianization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the Spanish, French, English, and Portuguese, or the forced Islamization of West African peoples by the Fula or of the Nuristanis by the Afghans.
* Indirect diffusion happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture, without the first and final cultures being in direct contact. An example could be the presence of Mexican food in Canada since a large territory (the United States) lies between.

Direct diffusion was common in ancient times when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements. Indirect diffusion is common in today&#x27;s world because of the mass media and the invention of the Internet. Also of interest is the work of American historian and critic Daniel J. Boorstin in his book &quot;The Discoverers&quot;, in which he provides a historical perspective on the role of explorers in the diffusion of innovations between civilizations.

==Theories==
The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are:
* Migrationism, the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements
* Culture circles diffusionism (&quot;Kulturkreise&quot;)—the theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures
* &quot;Kulturkugel&quot; (a German compound meaning &quot;culture bullet&quot;, coined by J. P. Mallory), a mechanism suggested by Mallory to model the scale of invasion vs. gradual migration vs. diffusion. According to this model, local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity, so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization.
* Hyperdiffusionism—the theory that all cultures originated from one culture

A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of &quot;an idea whose time has come&quot;—whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibnitz, and the inventions of the airplane and of the electronic computer.

==Hyperdiffusionism==

Hyperdiffusionists deny that parallel evolution or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history; they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture.

Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about South America being the origin of mankind. Antonio de León Pinelo, a Spaniard who settled in Bolivia, claimed in his book &quot;Paraíso en el Nuevo Mundo&quot; that the Garden of Eden and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by migrations from there. Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada; in his book &quot;La Lengua de Adán&quot; he attempted to prove that Aymara was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in Sorata in the Bolivian Andes. The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine paleontologist Florentino Ameghino in 1880, who published his research in &quot;La antigüedad del hombre en el Plata&quot;.

The work of Grafton Elliot Smith fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that copper–producing knowledge spread from Egypt to the rest of the world along with megalithic culture. Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient Egyptians and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers. His views became known as &quot;Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism&quot;. William James Perry elaborated on Smith&#x27;s hypothesis by using ethnographic data. Another hyperdiffusionist was Lord Raglan; in his book &quot;How Came Civilization&quot; (1939) he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from Mesopotamia. Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear, but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia.

==Medieval Europe==
Diffusion theory has been advanced as an explanation for the &quot;European miracle&quot;, the adoption of technological innovation in medieval Europe which by the 19th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing the Islamic world and China. Technological imports to medieval Europe include gunpowder, clock mechanisms, shipbuilding, paper, and the windmill; however, in each of these cases, Europeans not only adopted the technologies but improved the manufacturing scale, inherent technology, and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin.

There are also some historians who have questioned whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder, the compass, the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures.

However, historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences, particularly trade, through the Middle East and Central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the &quot;rise of the West&quot;. He argues that the Renaissance was funded with trade with the east (due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the Fourth Crusade), and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe. But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage, and a desperate need to use them in expansion.

==Disputes==

While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general, conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed. An example of such disputes is the proposal by Thor Heyerdahl that similarities between the culture of Polynesia and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Andes are due to diffusion from the latter to the former—a theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists.

<text>Roberto Arlt (April 2, 1900 – July 26, 1942) was an Argentine novelist, storyteller, playwright, journalist and inventor.

==Biography==
He was born Roberto Godofredo Christophersen Arlt in Buenos Aires on April 2, 1900. His parents were both immigrants. His father, Karl Arlt, was from Posen (now Poznań in present-day Poland) and his mother was Ekatherine Lobstraibitzer, born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a native of Trieste and Italian speaking. German was the language commonly used at their home. His relationship with his father was stressful, as Karl Arlt was a very severe and austere man, by Arlt&#x27;s own account. The memory of his oppressive father would appear in several of his writings. For example, Remo Erdosain (a character at least partially based on Arlt&#x27;s own life) often recalls his abusive father and how little if any support he would give him. After being expelled from school at the age of eight, Arlt became an autodidact and worked at all sorts of different odd jobs before landing a job at a local newspaper: a clerk at a bookstore, apprentice to a tinsmith, painter, mechanic, welder, manager in a brick factory, and dock worker.

His first novel, &quot;El juguete rabioso&quot; (1926) (&quot;Mad Toy&quot;), was the semi-autobiographical story of Silvio, a dropout who goes through a series of adventures trying to be &quot;somebody.&quot; Narrated by Silvio&#x27;s older self, the novel reflects the energy and chaos of the early 20th century in Buenos Aires. The narrator&#x27;s literary and sometimes poetic language contrasts sharply with the street-level slang of Mad Toy&#x27;s many colorful characters.

Arlt&#x27;s second novel, the popular &quot;Los siete locos&quot; (&quot;The Seven Madmen&quot;) was rough, brutal, colloquial, and surreal, a complete break from the polite, middle-class literature more typical of Argentine literature. &quot;Los lanzallamas&quot; (&quot;The Flame-Throwers&quot;) was the sequel, and these two novels together are thought by many to be his greatest work. What followed were a series of short stories and plays in which Arlt pursued his vision of bizarre, half-mad, alienated characters pursuing insane quests in a landscape of urban chaos. In 1932 he published &quot;El amor brujo&quot;.

During his lifetime, however, Arlt was best known for his &quot;Aguafuertes&quot; (&quot;Etchings&quot;), the result of his contributions as a columnist - between 1928 and 1942 - to the Buenos Aires daily &quot;El Mundo&quot;. Arlt used these columns to comment, in his characteristically forthright and unpretentious style, on the peculiarities, hypocrisies, strangeness, and beauty of everyday life in Argentina&#x27;s capital. These articles included occasional exposés of public institutions, such as the juvenile justice system (&quot;Escuela primaria de delincuencia&quot;, 26–29 September 1932) or the Public Health System. Some of the &quot;Aguafuertes&quot; were collected in two volumes under the titles &quot;Secretos femeninos. Aguafuertes inéditas&quot; and &quot;Tratado de delincuencia. Aguafuertes inéditas&quot; which were edited by Sergio Olguín and published by Ediciones 12 and Página/12 in 1996.

Between March and May 1930, Arlt wrote a series of &quot;Aguafuertes&quot; as a correspondent to &quot;El Mundo&quot; in Rio de Janeiro. In 1935 he spent nearly a year writing as he traveled throughout Spain and North Africa, on the eve of the Spanish Civil War. At the time of his death, Arlt was hoping to be sent to the United States as a correspondent.

Worn out and exhausted after a lifetime of hardships, he died from a stroke on July 26, 1942. His coffin was lowered from his apartment by an operated crane, an ironic end, considering his bizarre stories.

Arlt has been massively influential on Latin American literature, including the 1960s &quot;Boom&quot; generation of writers such as Gabriel García Márquez. &quot;Let&#x27;s say, modestly, that Arlt is Jesus Christ,&quot; propounded Roberto Bolaño. Analogues in English literature are those who avoid literary &#x27;respectability&#x27; by writing about the poor, the criminal and the mad: writers like William Burroughs, Iceberg Slim, and Irvine Welsh. Arlt, however, predated all of them. He is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern Argentine novel; among those contemporary writers who claim to have been influenced by Arlt are Abelardo Castillo, Ricardo Piglia and César Aira. At least two Argentine movies were based on his novels, &quot;Los siete locos&quot; (1974) and &quot;El juguete rabioso&quot; (1985). Peter Damian Bellis, an editor of the independent press River Boat Books of Minneapolis, became resolved to make &quot;Los siete locos&quot; and &quot;Los lanzallamas&quot; available together in English translation. Although a plan to publish the two closely linked novels in the same volume initially proved unfeasible, &quot;The Seven Madmen&quot; and &quot;The Flamethrowers&quot;, respectively translated by Naomi Lindstrom and Larry Riley, appeared simultaneously in July 2018. River Boat&#x27;s combined edition of both novels eventually appeared in January 2022 under the title &quot;Madmen in Revolt.&quot; In 2002 Duke University Press published &quot;Mad Toy&quot; translated and introduced by Michele McKay Aynesworth.

<doc id="994304" wikidata="Q1275853" url="?curid=994304" title="William Wilson (short story)">
<text>&quot;William Wilson&quot; is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1839 in &quot;The Gift&quot;, with a setting inspired by Poe&#x27;s formative years on the outskirts of London. The tale features a doppelgänger. It also appeared in the 1840 collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot;, and has been adapted several times.

==Plot summary==

The story follows a man of &quot;a noble descent&quot; who calls himself William Wilson because, although denouncing his past, he does not accept full blame for his actions, saying that &quot;man was never thus ... tempted before&quot;. After several paragraphs, the narration then segues into a description of Wilson&#x27;s boyhood, which is spent in a school &quot;in a misty-looking village of England&quot;.
William meets another boy in his school who has the same name and roughly the same appearance, and who was even born on the same date (January 19, Poe&#x27;s birthday). William&#x27;s name (he asserts that his actual name is only similar to &quot;William Wilson&quot;) embarrasses him because it sounds &quot;plebeian&quot; or common, and he is irked that he must hear the name twice as much on account of the other William.

The boy also dresses like William, walks like him, but can only speak in a whisper. He begins to give advice to William of an unspecified nature, which he refuses to obey, resenting the boy&#x27;s &quot;arrogance&quot;. One night, he steals into the other William&#x27;s bedroom and recoils in horror at the boy&#x27;s face—which now resembles his own. William then immediately leaves the academy and, in the same week, the other boy follows suit.

William eventually attends Eton and University of Oxford, gradually becoming more debauched and performing what he terms &quot;mischief&quot;. For example, he steals from a man by cheating at cards. The other William appears, his face covered, and whispers a few words sufficient to alert others to William&#x27;s behavior, and then leaves with no others seeing his face. William is haunted by his double in subsequent years, who thwarts plans described by William as driven by ambition, anger and lust. In his latest caper, he attempts to seduce a married noblewoman at Carnival in Rome, but the other William stops him. The enraged protagonist drags his &quot;unresisting&quot; double—who wears identical clothes— into an antechamber, and, after a brief sword fight in which the double participates only reluctantly, stabs him fatally.

After William does this, a large mirror suddenly seems to appear. Reflected at him, he sees &quot;mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood&quot;: apparently the dead double, &quot;but he spoke no longer in a whisper&quot;. The narrator feels as if he is pronouncing the words: &quot;In me didst thou exist—and in my death, see ... how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.&quot;

== Background ==

The setting of &quot;William Wilson&quot; is semi-autobiographical and relates to Poe&#x27;s residence in England as a boy. The &quot;misty-looking village of England&quot; of the story is Stoke Newington, now a suburb of north London. The school is based on the Manor House School which Poe attended from 1817 to 1820. Poe&#x27;s headmaster there, the Reverend John Bransby, shares the same name as the headmaster in the story, though, in the latter, he acquires the dignity of being a &quot;Doctor&quot;. This school has since been demolished. The church mentioned in the story is based on St Mary&#x27;s &quot;Old&quot; Church, the original parish church of Stoke Newington. This building is still extant. In Poe&#x27;s story the church is described to have a Gothic spire. The spire, however, was only added to the church in 1829, some nine years after Poe had left the school.

Additionally, Poe acknowledged that the idea of a story about the irritation one feels by meeting someone with the same name, thereby ruining a feeling of uniqueness, was inspired by Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;An Unwritten Drama of Lord Byron&quot;. At the end of Irving&#x27;s tale, the main character kills his double with his sword, only to see his own face behind the mask.

==Analysis==
&quot;William Wilson&quot; clearly explores the theme of the double. This second self haunts the protagonist and leads him to insanity and also represents his own insanity. According to Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn, the second self represents the conscience. This division of the self is reinforced by the narrator&#x27;s admission that &quot;William Wilson&quot; is actually a pseudonym. The name itself is an interesting choice: &quot;son&quot; of &quot;will&quot;. In other words, William Wilson has willed himself into being along with the double which shares that name.

Poe wrote the story very carefully and with subtlety. Sentences are balanced, with very few adjectives, and there is little concrete imagery beyond the description of Wilson&#x27;s school. Pacing is purposely set as leisurely and measured using a formal style and longer sentences. Rather than creating a poetic effect or mood, as Poe recommends in &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;, Poe is creating a tale based on rationality and logic.

==Publication history==
&quot;William Wilson&quot; was published in the October 1839 issue of &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, though it appeared earlier that year in &quot;The Gift: A Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Present&quot; dated for 1840. The tale was later translated into French in December 1844, printed in the Paris newspaper &quot;La Quotidienne&quot; in two installments. This was the first translation of Poe&#x27;s work to a language other than English and marked Poe&#x27;s introduction to France.

==Critical reception==

When Poe wrote to Washington Irving asking for a word of endorsement, he specifically requested a response to &quot;William Wilson&quot;, calling it &quot;my best effort&quot;. Irving responded, &quot;It is managed in a highly picturesque Style and the Singular and Mysterious interest is well sustained throughout&quot;. Thomas Mann said of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Double: A Petersburg Poem&quot;, which explores a similar doppelgänger theme, &quot;by no means improved on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &#x27;William Wilson,&#x27; a tale that deals with the same old romantic motif in a way far more profound on the moral side and more successfully resolving the critical [theme] in the poetic&quot;.

In Poe&#x27;s review of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;, Poe noted that the short story &quot;Howe&#x27;s Masquerade&quot; was similar to &quot;William Wilson&quot;. As he wrote, &quot;not only are the two general conceptions identical but there are various points of similarity&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1913, &quot;William Wilson&quot; was freely adapted into &quot;The Student of Prague&quot;, a German film directed by Stellan Rye and Paul Wegener and starring Wegener. A 1926 version was also made in Germany and directed by Henrik Galeen and starred Conrad Veidt. A third German adaptation, made in 1935, was directed by Arthur Robison and starred Anton Walbrook.

In 1943, &quot;William Wilson&quot; was adapted as a radio play for &quot;The Weird Circle&quot; on the Mutual Broadcasting System.

A French-Italian collaboration came out in 1968 called &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot; or &quot;Histoires extraordinaires&quot;. The film is composed of three vignettes, directed by Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini and starring Alain Delon and Brigitte Bardot. The other two segments adapt Poe&#x27;s &quot;Metzengerstein&quot; and &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot;. It would also form the basis for The Smithereens&#x27; song of the same name, from their 1989 album &quot;11&quot;.

In 1968, Editora Taika in Brazil published a comic adaptation in &quot;Album Clássicos de Terror #6&quot;. Art was by Osvaldo Talo. It was reprinted in &quot;Clássicos de Terror&quot; (2nd series) #5 in June 1973.

In 1974, Skywald published a comic adaptation in &quot;Nightmare&quot; #19 (June 1974), adapted by Al Hewetson, with art by Alfonso Font. This was reprinted by Mehmet K. Benli Turkey in &quot;Vampirella&quot; #3 (October 25, 1976) and &quot;Vampirella&quot; # (1977); and by Eternity Comics in &quot;Edgar Allan Poe: The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories&quot; #1 (June 1988).

In 1976 the BBC anthology series &quot;Centre Play&quot; aired an adaptation written by Hugh Whitemore featuring Norman Eshley as the title character along with Stephen Murray, Anthony Daniels, and Robert Tayman.

In 1976, British filmmaker Peter de Rome made a loose adaptation of the story with his second and final feature, &quot;The Destroying Angel&quot;, a hybrid of horror movie and gay porn film, produced by New York studio Hand in Hand Films. The film is about a man on sabbatical from seminary who experiences inner conflict between his sexual desires and his call to the cloth, which is made manifest through the appearances of his doppelgänger. The stabbing scene in Poe&#x27;s story is the one moment that is directly paralleled in the film. Peter de Rome said he was inspired to make this film when he saw a portrait of Poe and realized that Poe was, essentially, visually his own doppelganger.

In 1979, Ediciones de la Urraca in Argentina published a comic adaptation in &quot;El Péndulo&quot; #2 (October 1979). Adaptation was by Guillermo Saccomanno, art was by Alberto Breccia. This was reprinted by Les Humanoïdes Associés in France in &quot;Le Cœur révélateur&quot; (1992 and September 1995) and by Doedyeeditores in Argentina in &quot;El gato negro y otras historias&quot; (2011).

In 1979, Bloch Editores S.A. in Brazil published a comic adaptation in &quot;Aventuras Macabras&quot; #12 (1979). The adaptation and art were by José Menezes.

In 1999, Spanish director Jorge Dayas released a 35 mm animated short film, awarded in Animadrid 2000 and Málaga Film Festival.

==References in other works==

There are strains of the story of &quot;William Wilson&quot; in Andrew Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The American Boy&quot;, in which Edgar Allan Poe himself is featured as a character.

Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; has been cited as at least a parody of the story.

In Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Pierrot Le Fou&quot;, the main character, Ferdinand, summarizes the story as an example of things that he and the other protagonist, Marianne, could perform to earn money.

Paul Auster&#x27;s novel &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; features a character named Quinn who writes under the pseudonym &quot;William Wilson&quot;. The novel uses intertextuality to explore the nature of identity and reality.

In Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Outsider&quot;, the detective character Anderson draws a parallel between the case he investigates and Poe&#x27;s story &quot;William Wilson&quot;. Stephen King also told the media that the novel is partly inspired by this story. King also refers to &quot;William Wilson&quot; in his 1980 novel &quot;Firestarter&quot;, in which a man subjected to mind control begins dangerously obsessing over the Poe story.

<doc id="994309" wikidata="Q5255340" url="?curid=994309" title="Demic diffusion">
<text>Demic diffusion, as opposed to trans-cultural diffusion, is a demographic term referring to a migratory model, developed by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, of population diffusion into and across an area that had been previously uninhabited by that group and possibly but not necessarily displacing, replacing, or intermixing with an existing population (such as has been suggested for the spread of agriculture across Neolithic Europe and several other &quot;Landnahme&quot; events).

In its original formulation, the demic diffusion model includes three phases: (1) population growth, prompted by new available resources as in the case of early farmers, and/or other technological developments; (2) a dispersal into regions with lower population density; (3) a limited initial admixture with the people encountered in the process.

==Evidence==
Theoretical work by Cavalli-Sforza showed that if admixture between expanding farmers and previously-resident groups of hunters and gatherers was not immediate, the process would result in the establishment of broad genetic gradients. Because broad gradients, spanning much of Europe from southeast to northwest, were identified in empirical genetic studies by Cavalli-Sforza, Robert R. Sokal, Guido Barbujani, Lounès Chikhi and others, it seemed likely that the spread of agriculture into Europe occurred by the expansion and the spread of agriculturists, who possibly originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East. That is referred to as the Neolithic demic diffusion model.

Craniometric and archaeological studies have also arrived at the same conclusion.

<doc id="994312" wikidata="Q1266338" url="?curid=994312" title="History of the Balkans">
<text>The Balkans, partly corresponding with the Balkan Peninsula, encompasses areas that may also be placed in Southeastern, Southern, Eastern Europe and Central Europe. The distinct identity and fragmentation of the Balkans owes much to its often turbulent history, with the region experiencing centuries of Ottoman conflict and conquest. The Balkan Peninsula is predominantly mountainous, featuring several mountain ranges such as the Dinaric Alps, the Pindus Mountains and the Balkan Mountains.

==Prehistory==
===Mesolithic===

First human settlement in Europe is Iron Gates Mesolithic (11000 to 6000 BC), located in Danube River, in modern Serbia and Romania. It has been described as &quot;the first city in Europe&quot;, due to its permanency, organisation, as well as the sophistication of its architecture and construction techniques.

===Neolithic===

Archaeologists have identified several early culture-complexes, including the Cucuteni culture (4500 to 3500 BC), Starcevo culture (6500 to 4000 BC), Vinča culture (5500 to 3000 BC), Linear pottery culture (5500 to 4500 BC), and Ezero culture (3300—2700 BC). The Eneolithic Varna culture in Bulgaria (4600–4200 BC radiocarbon dating) produced the world&#x27;s earliest known gold treasure and had sophisticated beliefs about afterlife. A notable set of artifacts are the Tărtăria tablets found in Romania, which appear to be inscribed with proto-writing.

The &quot;Kurgan hypothesis&quot; of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origins assumes gradual expansion of the &quot;Kurgan culture&quot;, around 5000 BC, until it encompassed the entire pontic steppe. Kurgan IV was identified with the Yamna culture of around 3000 BC.

Yamnaya steppe pastoralists apparently migrated into the Balkans about 3000 to 2500 BCE, and they soon admixed with the local populations, which resulted in a tapestry of various ancestry from which speakers of the Albanoid, Hellenic, and other Paleo-Balkan languages emerged.

===Bronze and Iron Age===
At ca. 1000 BC, Illyrian tribes appear in what is modern day Albania and all the way aside Adriatic Sea in modern day Montenegro, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, parts of Serbia and North Macedonia. The Thracians lived in Thrace and adjacent lands (now mainly Bulgaria, but also Romania, northeastern Greece, European Turkey, eastern Serbia and North Macedonia), and the closely related Dacians lived in what is today Romania. These three major tribal groups spoke Paleo-Balkan languages, Indo-European languages. The Phrygians seem to have settled in the southern Balkans at first, centuries later continuing their migration to settle in Asia Minor, now extinct as a separate group and language.

==Antiquity==

=== Iron Age ===
After the period that followed the arrival of the Dorians, known as the Greek Dark Ages or the Geometric Period, the classical Greek culture developed in the southern Balkan peninsula, the Aegean islands and the western Asia Minor Greek colonies starting around the 9th or 8th century BC and peaking with the democracy that developed in 6th and 5th century BC Athens. Later, Hellenistic culture spread throughout the empire created by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. The Greeks were the first to establish a system of trade routes in the Balkans, and in order to facilitate trade with the natives, between 700 BC and 300 BC they founded a number of colonies on the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus) coast, Asia Minor, Dalmatia, Southern Italy (Magna Graecia) etc.

By the end of the 4th century BC, Greek language and culture were dominant not only in the Balkans but also around the whole Eastern Mediterranean. In the late 6th century BC, the Persians invaded the Balkans, and then proceed to the more fertile areas of Europe. Parts of the Balkans and more northern areas were ruled by the Achaemenid Persians for some time, including Thrace, Paeonia, Macedon, and most Black Sea coastal regions of Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia. However, the outcome of the Greco-Persian Wars resulted in the Achaemenids being forced to withdraw from most of their European territories.

The Thracian Odrysian kingdom was the most important Thracian state union. It was founded c.470 BC after the Persian defeat in Greece, had its capital at Seuthopolis, near Kazanlak, Stara Zagora Province, in central Bulgaria. Other tribal unions existed in Dacia at least as early as the beginning of the 2nd century BC under King Oroles. The Illyrian tribes were situated in the area corresponding to today&#x27;s Adriatic coast. The name &quot;Illyrii&quot; was originally used to refer to a people occupying an area centered on Lake Skadar, situated between Albania and Montenegro (Illyrians proper). However, the term was subsequently used by the Greeks and Romans as a generic name for the different peoples within a well defined but much greater area. In the same way, the territory to the north of the kingdom of Macedon was occupied by the Paeonians, who were also ruled by kings.

===Achaemenid Persian Empire (6th to 5th century BC)===
Around 513 BC, as part of the military incursions ordered by Darius I, a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the Western Scythians roaming to the north of the Danube river. Several Thracian peoples, and nearly all of the other European regions bordering the Black Sea (including parts of the modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia), were conquered by the Achaemenid army before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius&#x27;s highly regarded commander Megabazus was responsible for fulfilling the conquest of the Balkans. The Achaemenid troops conquered Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, and the Paeonians. Eventually, in about 512–511 BC, the Macedonian king Amyntas I accepted the Achaemenid domination and surrendered his country as a vassal state to the Achaemenid Persia. The multi-ethnic Achaemenid army possessed many soldiers from the Balkans. Moreover, many of the Macedonian and Persian elite intermarried. For instance, Megabazus&#x27; own son, Bubares, married Amyntas&#x27; daughter, Gygaea; and that supposedly ensured good relations between the Macedonian and Achaemenid rulers.

Following the Ionian Revolt, the Persian authority in the Balkans was restored by Mardonius in 492. This not only included the re-subjugation of Thrace, but also the full subordinate inclusion of Macedon into the Persian Empire. The Persian invasion led indirectly to Macedonia&#x27;s rise in power and Persia had some common interests in the Balkans; with Persian aid, the Macedonians stood to gain much at the expense of some Balkan tribes such as the Paeonians and Greeks. All in all, the Macedonians were &quot;willing and useful Persian allies.&quot; Macedonian soldiers fought against Athens and Sparta in Xerxes&#x27; army.

Although Persian rule in the Balkans was overthrown following the failure of Xerxes&#x27; invasion, the Macedonians and Thracians borrowed heavily from the Achaemenid Persians their tradition in culture and economy in the 5th- to mid-4th centuries. Some artifacts, excavated at Sindos and Vergina may be considered as influenced by Asian practices, or even imported from Persia in the late sixth and early fifth centuries.

===Pre-Roman states (4th to 1st centuries BC)===
Bardylis, a Dardanian chieftain, created a kingdom which turned Illyria into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. The main cities of this kingdom were Scodra (present-day Shkodra, Albania) and Rhizon (present-day Risan, Montenegro). In 359 BC, King Perdiccas III of Macedon was killed by attacking Illyrians.

But in 358 BC, Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, defeated the Illyrians and assumed control of their territory as far as Lake Ohrid (present-day North Macedonia). Alexander himself routed the forces of the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus in 335 BC, and Illyrian tribal leaders and soldiers accompanied Alexander on his conquest of Persia. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the Greek states started fighting among themselves again, while up north independent Illyrian polities arose again. In 312 BC, King Glaukias seized Epidamnus. By the end of the 3rd century BC, an Illyrian kingdom based in Scodra controlled parts of northern Albania, and littoral Montenegro. Under Queen Teuta, Illyrians attacked Roman merchant vessels plying the Adriatic Sea and gave Rome an excuse to invade the Balkans.

In the Illyrian Wars of 229 BC and 219 BC, Rome overran the Illyrian settlements in the Neretva river valley and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe. In 180 BC, the Dalmatians declared themselves independent of the Illyrian king Gentius, who kept his capital at Scodra. The Romans defeated Gentius, the last king of Illyria, at Scodra in 168 BC and captured him, bringing him to Rome in 165 BC. Four client-republics were set up, which were in fact ruled by Rome. Later, the region was directly governed by Rome and organized as a province, with Scodra as its capital. Also, in 168 BC, by taking advantage of the constant Greek civil wars, the Romans defeated Perseus, the last King of Macedonia and with their allies in southern Greece, they became overlords of the region. The territories were split to Macedonia, Achaia and Epirus.

==Roman period==
Starting in the 2nd century BC, the rising Roman Republic began annexing the Balkan area, transforming it into one of the Empire&#x27;s most prosperous and stable regions. To this day, the Roman legacy is clearly visible in the numerous monuments and artifacts scattered throughout the Balkans, and most importantly in the Latin-based languages used by almost 25 million people in the area (the Eastern Romance languages). However, the Roman influence failed to dissolve Greek culture, which maintained a predominant status in the Eastern half of the Empire, and continued to be strong in the southern half of the Balkans.

Beginning in the 3rd century AD, Rome&#x27;s frontiers in the Balkans were weakened because of internal political and economic disorders. During this time, the Balkans, especially Illyricum, grew to greater importance. It became one of the Empire&#x27;s four prefectures, and many warriors, administrators and emperors arose from the region. Many rulers built their residences in the region.

Though the situation had stabilized temporarily by the time of Constantine, waves of non-Roman peoples, most prominently the Thervings, Greuthungs and Huns, began to cross into the territory, first (in the case of the Thervingi) as refugees with imperial permission to take shelter from their foes the Huns, then later as invaders. Turning on their hosts after decades of servitude and simmering hostility, Thervingi under Fritigern and later Visigoths under Alaric I eventually conquered and laid waste the entire Balkan region before moving westward to invade Italy itself.

By the end of the Empire the region had become a conduit for invaders to move westward, as well as the scene of treaties and complex political maneuvers by Romans, Goths and Huns, all seeking the best advantage for their peoples amid the shifting and disorderly final decades of Roman imperial power.

===Rise of Christianity===

Christianity first came to the area when Paul the Apostle and some of his followers traveled in the Balkans passing through Thracian, Illyrian and Greek populated areas. He spread Christianity to the Greeks at Beroia, Thessaloniki, Athens, Corinth and Dyrrachium. Andrew also worked among the Thracians, Dacians and Scythians, and had preached in Dobruja and Pontus Euxinus. In 46 AD, this territory was conquered by the Romans and annexed to Moesia.

In 106 AD the emperor Trajan invaded Dacia. Subsequently, Christian colonists, soldiers and slaves came to Dacia and spread Christianity. 

The Edict of Serdica, also called Edict of Toleration by Emperor Galerius, was issued in 311 in Serdica (today Sofia, Bulgaria) by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity in the East. In the 3rd century the number of Christians grew. When Emperor Constantine of Rome issued the Edict of Milan in 313, thus ending all Roman-sponsored persecution of Christianity, the area became a haven for Christians. Just twelve years later in 325, Constantine assembled the First Council of Nicaea. In 391, Theodosius I made Christianity the official religion of Rome.

The East-West Schism, known also as the Great Schism (though this latter term sometimes refers to the later Western Schism), was the event that divided Christianity into Western Catholicism and Greek Eastern Orthodoxy, following the dividing line of the Empire in Western Latin-speaking and Eastern Greek-speaking parts. Though normally dated to 1054, when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius excommunicated each other, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between the two Churches.

The primary claimed causes of the Schism were disputes over papal authority—the Pope claimed he held authority over the four Eastern patriarchs, while the patriarchs claimed that the Pope was merely a first among equals—and over the insertion of the filioque clause into the Nicene Creed. Most serious (and real) cause of course, was the competition for power between the old and the new capitals of the Roman Empire (Rome and Constantinople).
There were other, less significant catalysts for the Schism, including variance over liturgical practices and conflicting claims of jurisdiction.

==Early Middle Ages==

=== Eastern Roman Empire ===
The Byzantine Empire was the Greek-speaking, Eastern Roman Empire during the Middle Ages, centered at its capital in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). During most of its history this Empire controlled provinces in the Balkans and in Asia Minor. Under the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I (), the Byzantines for a time retook and restored much of the territory once held by the unified Roman Empire, from Spain and Italy via North Africa to Anatolia. Unlike the Western Roman Empire, which met a famous if rather ill-defined death in the year 476 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire came to a much less famous but far more definitive conclusion at the hands of Mehmet II and the Ottoman Empire in the year 1453. Its expert military and diplomatic power ensured inadvertently that Western Europe remained safe from many of the more devastating invasions from eastern peoples during a period when the still new and fragile Western Christian kingdoms might have had difficulty containing them.

The magnitude of influence and contribution which the Byzantine Empire made to Europe and to Christendom has only begun to be recognised recently. The Emperor Justinian I&#x27;s formation of a new code of law, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; of 529 to 534, served as a basis of subsequent development of many European legal codes. Byzantium played an important role in the transmission of classical Greco-Roman knowledge to the Islamic world and to Renaissance Italy. Byzantium&#x27;s rich historiographical tradition preserved ancient knowledge upon which splendid art, architecture, literature and technological achievements were built.

Byzantine culture is embodied in the Byzantine version of Christianity, which spread Orthodoxy and eventually led to the development of the so-called &quot;Byzantine commonwealth&quot; (a term coined by 20th-century historians) throughout Eastern Europe. Early Byzantine missionary-work spread Orthodox Christianity to various Slavic peoples, amongst several of which it still is a predominant religion. Jewish communities also spread through the Balkans at this time, while the Jews were primarily Romaniotes. In a Greek-influenced &quot;Byzantine commonwealth&quot;, the Greek Christian culture and also the Romaniote culture influenced the emerging societies both of the Christian and of the Jewish communities of the Balkans and of Eastern Europe.

Throughout its history, Byzantium had fluctuating borders: the Empire often became involved in multi-sided conflicts with not only the Arabs, Persians and Turks of the east, but also with its Christian neighbours- the Bulgarians, Serbs, Normans and the Crusaders, which each at one time or another conquered large amounts of its territory. By the end, the Empire consisted of nothing but Constantinople and small holdings in mainland Greece, with all other territories both in the Balkans and in Asia Minor gone. The conclusion came in 1453, when Mehmet II successfully besieged the city and brought the Second Rome to an end.

===Barbarian incursions===
Coinciding with the decline of the Roman Empire, many &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes entered or passed through the Balkans; most of them did not leave any lasting state. During these &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, Eastern Europe, like Western Europe, regressed culturally and economically, although enclaves of prosperity and culture persisted in the coastal towns along the Adriatic and in the major Greek cities in the south. As the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s borders shrank more and more, in an attempt to consolidate its waning power, vast areas were de-urbanised and roads abandoned; native populations may have withdrawn to isolated areas such as mountains and forests.

The first tribal barbarians to enter the Byzantine-era Balkans were the Goths. From northern East Germany, via Scythia, they pushed southwards into the Roman Balkans following the threat of the Huns. Roman Emperors eventually granted these Goths lands inside the Byzantine realm (south of the Danube), as (allies). However, after a period of famine, the proto-Visigoths rebelled and defeated the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens in 378. The Visigoths subsequently sacked Rome in 410, and in an attempt to deal with them, the Western Roman Emperor Honorius granted them lands in Gaul.

The Huns, a confederation of a Turkic-Uralic ruling core that subsequently incorporated various Germanic, Sarmatian and Slavic tribes, moved west into Europe, entering Pannonia in 400–410 AD. The Huns may have triggered the great migration of Germanic peoples into western Europe.
From their Pannonian base, the Huns subdued many peoples and carved out a sphere of terror extending from Germany and the Baltic to the Black Sea. With the death of Attila in 454 AD, succession struggles led to the rapid collapse of Hun prestige and the subsequent fading of the Huns from European history.

The Ostrogoths freed themselves from Hunnish domination in 454 AD and became as well. The Ostrogoths, commissioned by the Byzantines, migrated westwards and established a state in Italy. In the second half of the 5th- and first half of the 6th-centuries, new Germanic barbarian tribes entered the Balkans. The Gepids, having lived in Dacia in the 3rd century with the Goths, settled Pannonia and eventually conquered Singidunum (Belgrade) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), establishing a short-lived kingdom in the 6th century. The Lombards entered Pannonia in 550s, defeated the Gepids and absorbed them. In 569 the Lombards moved into northern Italy, establishing their own kingdom at the expense of the Ostrogoths.

===Migration Period===

The Slavs, called by the Greco-Romans &#x27;Sklavenoi&quot; and &quot;Antes&quot;, migrated in successive waves from the 6th century onwards. The Slavs migrated from Eastern and Central Europe, those settling in the Balkans and eventually became known as South Slavs. Most still remained subjects of the Roman Empire.
The Avars were a Turkic group (or possibly Mongol), possibly with a ruling core derived from the Rouran that escaped the Göktürks. They entered Central Europe in the 7th century AD, forcing the Lombards to flee to Italy. They continuously raided the Balkans, contributing to the general decline of the area that had begun centuries earlier. After their unsuccessful siege on Constantinople in 626, the Avars limited themselves to Central Europe. They ruled over the Western Slavs who already inhabited the region. By the 10th century, the Avar confederacy collapsed due to internal conflicts and to Frankish and Slavic attacks. The remnant Avars were subsequently absorbed by the Slavs and Magyars.

The Bulgars, a Turkic people of Central Asia, first appeared in a wave which commenced with the arrival of Asparuh&#x27;s Bulgars. Asparuh was one of the successors of Kubrat, the Great Khan of Old Great Bulgaria on the pontic Steppe. The Bulgars had occupied the fertile plains of Ukraine for several centuries until the Khazars swept in to their confederation in the 660s and triggered their further migration. One part of them — under the leadership of Asparuh — headed southwest and settled in the 670s in present-day Bessarabia. In 680 AD they invaded Moesia and Dobrudja and formed a confederation with the local Slavic tribes who had migrated there a century earlier.

After suffering a defeat at the hands of Bulgars and Slavs, the Byzantine Empire recognised the sovereignty of Asparuh&#x27;s Khanate in a subsequent treaty signed in 681 AD. The same year is usually regarded as the year of the establishment of Bulgaria (see History of Bulgaria). A smaller group of Bulgars under Khan Kouber settled almost simultaneously in the Pelagonian plain in western Macedonia after spending some time in Pannonia. Some Bulgars actually entered Europe earlier with the Huns. After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire the Bulgars dispersed mostly to eastern Europe.

The Magyars, led by Árpád, were the leading clan in a ten-tribe confederacy. They settled at the end of the 9th century in the Carpathian Basin. There they encountered a predominantly Slavic populace and Avar remnants. The Magyars were a Uralic people, originating from west of the Ural Mountains. They learned the art of horseback warfare from Turkic people. They then migrated further west around 400 AD, settling in the Don-Dnieper area. Here they were subjects of the Khazar Khaganate. They were neighboured by the Bulgars and the Alans. They sided with three rebel Khazar tribes against the ruling factions. Their loss in this civil war, and ongoing battles with the Pechenegs, probably served as the catalyst for them to move further west into Europe.

===First Bulgarian Empire===
In the 7th century, the First Bulgarian Empire was established by Khan Asparuh. It greatly increased in strength in the following centuries, stretching from the Dnieper to present-day Budapest and the Mediterranean. Bulgaria dominated the Balkans for the next four centuries and was instrumental in the adoption of Christianity in the region and among other Slavs. Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great (), following the cultural and political course of his father Boris I (), ordered the creation of the Bulgarian alphabet, which was later spread by missionaries to the north, reaching the lands of present-day Russia.

=== Principality of Arbanon ===

Arbanon, ruled by the native Progoni family, is officially viewed (ignoring the Illyrian tribe of the Abroi/Albanoi) as the first Albanian state. It was founded 1190 in the lands of Kruja, to the east and northeast of Venetian territories. Progon&#x27;s sons Gjin and Demetrius succeeded their father and managed to retain a considerable degree of autonomy from the Byzantine Empire. However, , Arbanon lost its great autonomy.

==High Middle Ages==

===Republic of Venice===
The Uprising of Asen and Peter was a revolt of Bulgarians and Vlachs living in Moesia and the Balkan Mountains, then the theme of Paristrion of the Byzantine Empire, caused by a tax increase. It began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, ruled by the Asen dynasty.
In building its maritime commercial empire, the Republic of Venice dominated the trade in salt, acquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean, including Cyprus and Crete, and became a major &quot;power&quot; in the Near East and in all the Balkans. Venice seized a number of locations on the eastern shores of the Adriatic Sea before 1200, partly for purely commercial reasons, but also because pirates based there were a menace to its trade. The Doge since that time bore the titles of &quot;Duke of Dalmatia&quot; and &quot;Duke of Istria&quot;. Venice became a fully imperial power following the Venetian-financed Fourth Crusade, which in 1203 captured and in 1204 sacked and conquered Constantinople, dividing the Byzantine Empire into several smaller states and established the Latin Empire.

Venice carved out a sphere of influence in the Aegean known as the Duchy of the Archipelago, and gained control of the island of Crete. Weakened by constant warfare with Bulgaria and the unconquered sections of the empire, the Latin Empire eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it until the 14th century.

==Late Middle Ages==

===Serbian Empire===

In 1346, The Serbian Empire was established by King Stefan Dušan (Who was known by many as &quot;Dušan the Mighty&quot;). He was able to significantly expand the state. Under Dušan&#x27;s rule, Serbia was the major power in the Balkans, and a multi-lingual empire that stretched from the Danube to the Gulf of Corinth, with its capital in Skopje. He also promoted the Serbian Archbishopric to the Serbian Patriarchate. Dušan enacted the constitution of the Serbian Empire, known as Dušan&#x27;s Code, which was one of the most important literary works of Medieval Serbia. He was crowned as Emperor and autocrat of the Serbs and Greeks (Romans). His son and successor, Uroš the Weak, lost most of the territory conquered by Dušan, hence his epithet. The Serbian Empire effectively ended with the death of Uroš V in 1371 and the break-up of the Serbian state.

===Ottoman invasion===
In the 14th century, Ottoman rule would extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Sultan Orhan captured the city of Bursa in 1326 and would make it the new capital of the Ottoman state. The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern Anatolia. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Empire controlled nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when Timur invaded Anatolia in the Battle of Ankara in 1402. The son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, reorganized the state and the military, and demonstrated his martial prowess by capturing Constantinople on 29 May 1453, at the age of 21.

The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Mehmed II cemented the status of the Empire as the preeminent power in southeastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean. After taking Constantinople, Mehmed met with the Orthodox patriarch, Gennadios. An agreement would later be worked out in which the Eastern Orthodox Church would exchange their ability to maintain its autonomy and land and then accepted Ottoman authority. The Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective Sultans. Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) dramatically expanded the Empire&#x27;s eastern and southern frontiers by defeating Shah Ismail of Safavid Persia, in the Battle of Chaldiran.

===League of Lezhë===

The League of Lezhë, also commonly referred to as the Albanian League, was a military and diplomatic alliance of the Albanian aristocracy, created in the city of Lezhë on 2 March 1444. The League of Lezhë is considered the first unified independent Albanian country in the Medieval age, with Skanderbeg as leader of the regional Albanian chieftains and nobles united against the Ottoman Empire. Skanderbeg was proclaimed &quot;Chief of the League of the Albanian People&quot;. 
The League&#x27;s forces had victories against the Ottomans at Torvioll (1444), Mokra (1445), Otonetë (1446), Oranik (1448), a loss at Svetigrad (1448) victory in Polog (1453), victory at Krujë (1450), Albulena (1457), Ohrid (1464), Mokra (1462) and many others.

Skanderbeg&#x27;s first big victory against the Ottomans was at the Battle of Torvioll, and the news of the victory of the Albanians over the Turks spread very quickly in Europe. In the two years that followed, the Albanian-Tetan coalition won over the Ottomans. On May 14, 1450, the first siege of Kruja began, which the Ottomans had to end the following year without success. In 1451, Skanderbeg formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Naples for the time being; however, the Albanians received no help from there. In 1452, the Ottomans were defeated at Mokrra and Meçadi. After the fall of Constantinople, Albanians received financial aid from Naples and Venice as well as from the Pope. Until 1462, Skanderbeg&#x27;s troops were able to defeat the Ottomans every year without significantly weakening their superiority. Every year, the sultan was able to send a new army without difficulty. Only in 1460 and 1463 did ceasefires interrupt the fighting. In 1462, Skanderbeg succeeded in taking the important city of Ohrid.
In 1466 the second siege of Kruje Castle was knocked down. However, the Ottomans founded the fortress Elbasan south in the valley of the Shkumbin and thus finally settled in Albania. In 1467 a third siege of Kruje failed.
By 1468, the 10,000-strong Skanderbeg army could withstand the Ottomans. The Albanians received financial support from Venice and from the kings of Hungary and Naples. After Skanderbeg died in 1468, the Lezha League began to disintegrate. Following the Venetians, the Northern Albanians in particular continued the fight against the Ottomans. When Shkodra, which until then had been dominated by the Venetians, was taken by the Ottomans in 1479, the resistance collapsed, and the entire Albanian settlement area was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.

===Adriatic region===
From the 14th century, Venice controlled most of the maritime commerce of the Balkans with important colonial possessions on the Adriatic and Aegean coasts. Venice&#x27;s long decline started in the 15th century, when it first made an unsuccessful attempt to hold Thessalonica against the Ottomans (1423–1430). She also sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks (1453). After the city fell to Sultan Mehmet II, he declared war on Venice. The war lasted thirty years and cost Venice many of the eastern Mediterranean possessions. Slowly the Republic of Venice lost nearly all possessions in the Balkans, maintaining in the 18th century only the Adriatic areas of Istria, Dalmatia and Albania Veneta. The Venetian island of Corfu was the only area of Greece never occupied by the Turks. In 1797 Napoleon conquered Venice and caused the end of the Republic of Venice in the Balkans.

==Early modern period==

===Ottoman Empire===
 
Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the Early modern period. Ottoman rule was long, lasting from the 14th century up until the early 20th in some territories. The Ottoman Empire was religiously, linguistically and ethnically diverse, and, at times, a much more tolerant place for religious practices when compared to other parts of the world. The different groups in the empire were organised along confessional lines, in the so-called the Millet system. Among the Orthodox Christians of the empire (the Rum Millet) a common identity was forged based on a shared sense of time defined by the ecclesiastical calendar, saint&#x27;s days and feasts.

The social structure of the Balkans in the late 18th century was complex. The Ottoman rulers exercised control chiefly in indirect ways. In Albania and Montenegro, for example, local leaders paid nominal tribute to the Empire and otherwise had little contact. The Republic of Ragusa paid an annual tribute but otherwise was free to pursue its rivalry with the Republic of Venice. The two Romance-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia had their own nobility, but were ruled by Greek families chosen by the Sultan. In Greece, the elite comprised clergymen and scholars, but there was scarcely any Greek aristocracy.

A million or more Turks had settled in the Balkans, typically in smaller urban centers where they were garrison troops, civil servants, and craftsmen and merchants. There were also important communities of Jewish and Greek merchants. The Turks and Jews were not to be found in the countryside, so there was a very sharp social differentiation between the cities and their surrounding region in terms of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ottoman Empire collected taxes at about the 10% rate but there was no forced labor and the workers and peasants were not especially oppressed by the Empire. The Sultan favoured and protected the Orthodox clergy, primarily as a protection against the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics.

==Rise of nationalism in the Balkans==

The rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire caused the breakdown of millet concept. With the rise of national states and their histories, it is very hard to find reliable sources on the Ottoman concept of a nation and the centuries of the relations between House of Osman and the provinces, which turned into states. Unquestionably, understanding the Ottoman conception of nationhood helps us to understand what happened in the Balkans in the late Ottoman period.
* Bulgarian National Revival and National awakening of Bulgaria (18-19th century) 
* Serbian Revolution (1804–1815/1817/1833)
* Greek War of Independence (1821–1832)
* Albanian National Awakening (1830-1912)
* Bosnian uprising (1831–1832)

Serbian revolt in Herzegovina in 1875, which led to Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878), and the bloody suppression of the April Uprising in Bulgaria, became occasion of the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and the Liberation of Bulgaria and Serbia in 1878.

===Congress of Berlin===

The Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the leading statesmen of Europe&#x27;s Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire. In the wake of the Russia&#x27;s decisive victory in a war with Turkey, 1877–78, the urgent need was to stabilize and reorganize the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimize the risks of major war, while recognizing the reduced power of the Ottoman Empire, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers.

As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria lost Eastern Rumelia, which was restored to the Turks under a special administration. Macedonia, and East and Western Thrace were returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform and Northern Dobrudja became part of Romania, which achieved full independence but had to turn over part of Bessarabia to Russia. Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories. The Habsburgs took over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and effectively took control of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, in order to separate Serbia and Montenegro.

The results were at first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilization. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into World War in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, called at the time the &quot;sick man of Europe,&quot; was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that caused the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. The Habsburg Empire gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and found that he had tied Germany too closely to the Habsburg presence in the Balkans.

In the long-run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The congress was aimed at the revision of the Treaty of San Stefano and at keeping Constantinople in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia&#x27;s victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria, most notably Macedonia, thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 was one of many causes of the First Balkan War.

==20th century==
===Balkan Wars===
The Balkan Wars were two wars that took place in the Balkans in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, was defeated in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its holdings in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, was weakened as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus was a &quot;prelude to the First World War.&quot;

===World War I===
====Coming of war in 1914====
World War I was ignited from a spark in the Balkans, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austrian throne, Franz Ferdinand. Princip was a member of a Serbian secret military society called the Crna Ruka (Serbian for &quot;Black Hand&quot;). Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary sent Serbia an ultimatum in July 1914 with several provisions largely designed to prevent Serbian compliance. When Serbia only partially fulfilled the terms of the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914.

Many members of the Austro-Hungarian government, such as Conrad von Hötzendorf had hoped to provoke a war with Serbia for several years. They had a couple of motives. In part they feared the power of Serbia and its ability to sow dissent and disruption in the empire&#x27;s &quot;south-Slav&quot; provinces under the banner of a &quot;greater Slav state&quot;. Another hope was that they could annex Serbian territories in order to change the ethnic composition of the empire. With more Slavs in the Empire, some in the German-dominated half of the government hoped to balance the power of the Magyar-dominated Hungarian government. Until 1914 more peaceful elements had been able to argue against these military strategies, either through strategic considerations or political ones. However, Franz Ferdinand, a leading advocate of a peaceful solution, had been removed from the scene, and more hawkish elements were able to prevail. Another factor in this was the development in Germany giving the Dual-Monarchy a &quot;blank cheque&quot; to pursue a military strategy that ensured Germany&#x27;s backing.

Austro-Hungarian planning for operations against Serbia was not extensive and they ran into many logistical difficulties in mobilizing the army and beginning operations against the Serbs. They encountered problems with train schedules and mobilization schedules, which conflicted with agricultural cycles in some areas. When operations began in early August Austria-Hungary was unable to crush the Serbian armies as many within the monarchy had predicted. One difficulty for the Austro-Hungarians was that they had to divert many divisions north to counter advancing Russian armies. Planning for operations against Serbia had not accounted for possible Russian intervention, which the Austro-Hungarian army had assumed would be countered by Germany. However, the German army had long planned on attacking France before turning to Russia given a war with the Entente powers. (See: &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot;) Poor communication between the two governments led to this catastrophic oversight.

====Fighting in 1914====
As a result, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s war effort was damaged almost beyond redemption within a couple of months of the war beginning. The Serb army, which was coming up from the south of the country, met the Austrian army at the Battle of Cer beginning on 12 August 1914.

The Serbians were set up in defensive positions against the Austro-Hungarians. The first attack came on 16 August, between parts of the 21st Austro-Hungarian division and parts of the Serbian Combined division. In harsh night-time fighting, the battle ebbed and flowed, until the Serbian line was rallied under the leadership of Stepa Stepanovic. Three days later the Austrians retreated across the Danube, having suffered 21,000 casualties against 16,000 Serbian casualties. This marked the first Allied victory of the war. The Austrians had not achieved their main goal of eliminating Serbia. In the next couple of months the two armies fought large battles at Drina (6 September to 11 November) and at Kolubara from 16 November to 15 December.

In the autumn, with many Austro-Hungarians tied up in heavy fighting with Serbia, Russia was able to make huge inroads into Austria-Hungary capturing Galicia and destroying much of the Empire&#x27;s fighting ability. It wasn&#x27;t until October 1915 with a lot of German, Bulgarian, and Turkish assistance that Serbia was finally occupied, although the weakened Serbian army retreated to Corfu with Italian assistance and continued to fight against the central powers.

Yugoslav Committee, a political interest group formed by South Slavs from Austria-Hungary during World War I, aimed at joining the existing south Slavic nations in an independent state. From this plan, a new kingdom eventually was born: The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians.

Montenegro declared war on 6 August 1914. Bulgaria, however, stood aside before eventually joining the Central Powers in 1915, and Romania joined the Allies in 1916.
In 1916 the Allies sent their ill-fated expedition to Gallipoli in the Dardanelles, and in the autumn of 1916 they established themselves in Salonika, establishing front. However, their armies did not move from front until near end of the war, when they marched up north to free territories under rule of Central Powers.
====Bulgaria====

Bulgaria, the most populous of the Balkan states with 7 million people sought to acquire Macedonia but when it tried it was defeated in 1913 in the Second Balkan War. In 1914 Bulgaria stayed neutral. However its leaders still hoped to acquire Macedonia, which was controlled by an ally, Serbia. In 1915 joining the Central Powers seemed the best route. Bulgaria mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. The Bulgarian-German-Austrian invasion of Serbia in 1915 was a quick victory, but by the end of 1915 Bulgaria was also fighting the British and French—as well as the Romanians in 1916 and the Greeks in 1917. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black markets elsewhere.

By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly was in control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918, which failed in 1916 &amp; 1917 was successful at Dobro Pole. Troops mutinied and peasants revolted, demanding peace. By month&#x27;s end Bulgaria signed an armistice, giving up its conquests and its military hardware. The Czar abdicated and Bulgaria&#x27;s war was over. The peace treaty in 1919 stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of £100 million.

===Consequences of World War I===

The war had enormous repercussions for the Balkan peninsula. People across the area suffered serious economic dislocation, and the mass mobilization resulted in severe casualties, particularly in Serbia where over 1.5 million Serbs died, which was approx. ¼ of the total population and over half of the male population. In less-developed areas World War I was felt in different ways: requisitioning of draft animals, for example, caused severe problems in villages that were already suffering from the enlistment of young men, and many recently created trade connections were ruined.

The borders of many states were completely redrawn, and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later Yugoslavia, was created. Both Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were formally dissolved. As a result, the balance of power, economic relations, and ethnic divisions were completely altered.

Some important territorial changes include:
* The addition of Transylvania and Eastern Banat to Romania
* The incorporation of Serbia, Montenegro, Slavonia, Croatia, Vojvodina, Carniola, part of Styria, most of Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.
* Istria, Zadar, and Trieste became part of Italy,

Between World War I and World War II, in order to create nation-states the following population movements were seen:
* In the interwar period, almost 1.5 million Greeks were removed from Turkey; almost 700,000 Turks removed from Greece
* The 1919 Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine provided for the reciprocal emigration of ethnic minorities between Greece and Bulgaria. Between 92,000 and 102,000 Bulgarians were removed from Greece; 35,000 Greeks were removed from Bulgaria. Although no agreement on exchange of population between Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was ever reached because of the latter&#x27;s adamant refusal to recognise any Bulgarian minority in its eastern regions, the number of refugees from Macedonia and Eastern Serbia to Bulgaria also exceeded 100,000. Between the two world wars, some 67,000 Turks emigrated from Bulgaria to Turkey on basis of bilateral agreements.
* Under the terms of 1940 Treaty of Craiova, 88,000 Romanians and Aromanians of Southern Dobruja were forced to move in Northern Dobruja and 65,000 Bulgarians of Northern Dobruja were forced to move in Southern Dobruja.

===World War II===

World War II in the Balkans started from the Italian attempts to create an Italian empire. They invaded Albania in 1939 and annexed after just a week to the Kingdom of Italy. Then demanded Greece to surrender in October 1940. However, the defiance of the Greek prime minister Metaxas on 28 October 1940, started the Greco-Italian war. After seven months of hard fighting, with some of the first Allied victories and the Italians losing nearly one third of Albania, Germany intervened to save its ally. In 1941, it invaded Yugoslavia with the forces they later used against the Soviet Union.

After the fall of Sarajevo on 16 April 1941 to Nazi Germany, the Yugoslav provinces of Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina were recreated as fascist satellite states, Nezavisna Država Hrvatska (NDH, the Independent State of Croatia). Croat-nationalist, Ante Pavelić was appointed leader. The Nazis effectively created the Handschar division and collaborated with Ustaše in order to combat the Yugoslav Partisans.

With help from Italy, they succeeded in conquering Yugoslavia within two weeks. They then joined forces with Bulgaria and invaded Greece from the Yugoslavian side. Despite Greek resistance, the Germans took advantage of the Greek army&#x27;s presence in Albania against the Italians to advance in Northern Greece and consequently conquer the entire country within 3 weeks, with the exception of Crete. However, even with the fierce Cretan resistance, which cost the Nazis the bulk of their elite paratrooper forces, the island capitulated after 11 days of fighting.

On 1 May the Balkan frontiers were once again reshuffled, with the creation of several puppet states, such as Croatia and Montenegro, the Albanian expansion into Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgarian annexation of territories in the Greek North, creation of a Vlach state in the Greek mountains of Pindus and the annexation of all the Ionian and part of the Aegean islands into Italy.

With the end of the war, the changes of the ethnic composition reverted to their original conditions and the settlers returned to their homelands, mainly the ones settled in Greece. An Albanian population of the Greek North, the Cams, were forced to flee their lands because they collaborated with the Italians. Their numbers were about 18 000 in 1944.

===Aftermath of World War II===

On 7–9 January 1945 Yugoslav authorities killed several hundred of declared Bulgarians in Macedonia as collaborators, in an event known as the &quot;Bloody Christmas&quot;.

The Greek Civil War was fought between 1944 and 1949 in Greece between the armed forces of the Greek government, supported at first by Britain and later by the United States, against the forces of the wartime resistance against the German occupation, whose leadership was controlled by the Communist Party of Greece. Its goal was the creation of a Communist Northern Greece. It was the first time in the Cold War that hostilities led to a proxy war. In 1949, the partisans were defeated by the government forces.

===Cold War===
During the Cold War, most of the countries in the Balkans were ruled by Soviet-supported communist governments.
The nationalism was not dead after World War II. Yugoslavia was not an isolated case of ethnic tension. For example: in Bulgaria, beginning in 1984, the Communist government led by Todor Zhivkov began implementing a policy of forced assimilation of the ethnic Turkish minority. Ethnic Turks were required to change their names to Bulgarian equivalents, or to leave the country. In 1989, a Turkish dissident movement was formed to resist these assimilationist measures. The Bulgarian government responded with violence and mass expulsions of the activists. In this repressive environment, over 300,000 ethnic Turks fled to neighboring Turkey.
However, despite being under communist governments, Yugoslavia (1948) and Albania (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. After World War 2, communist plans of merging Albania and Bulgaria into Yugoslavia were created, but later nullified when Albania broke all relations with Yugoslavia, due to Tito breaking from the USSR. Marshal Josip Broz Tito (1892–1980), later rejected the idea of merging with Bulgaria, and instead sought closer relations with the West, later even creating the Non-Aligned Movement, which brought them closer ties with third world countries. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward Communist China, later adopting an isolationist position.
The only non-communist countries were Greece and Turkey, which were (and still are) part of NATO.

Religious persecutions took place in Bulgaria, directed against the Christian Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches as well as the Muslim, Jewish and others in the country. Antagonism between the communist state and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church eased somewhat after Todor Zhivkov became Bulgarian Communist Party leader in 1956 for &quot;its historic role in helping preserve Bulgarian nationalism and culture&quot;.

===Post-Communism===
The late 1980s and the early 1990s brought the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. As westernization spread through the Balkans, many reforms were carried out that led to implementation of market economy and to privatization, among other capitalist reforms.

In Albania, Bulgaria and Romania the changes in political and economic system were accompanied by a period of political and economic instability and tragic events. The same was the case in most of former Yugoslav republics.

====Yugoslav wars====
The collapse of the Yugoslav federation was due to various factors in various republics that comprised it. In Serbia and Montenegro, there were efforts of different factions of the old party elite to retain power under new conditions along, and an attempt to create Greater Serbia by keeping all Serbs in one state. In Croatia and Slovenia, multi-party elections produced nationally inclined leadership that followed in the footsteps of their previous Communist predecessors and oriented itself towards capitalism and secession. Bosnia and Herzegovina was split between the conflicting interests of its Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, while Macedonia mostly tried to steer away from conflicting situations.

An outbreak of violence and aggression came as a consequence of unresolved national, political and economic questions. The conflicts caused the death of many civilians. The real start of the war was a military attack on Slovenia and Croatia taken by Serb-controlled JNA. Before the war, JNA had started accepting volunteers driven by ideology of Serbian nationalists keen to realise their nationalist goals.

The Ten-Day War in Slovenia in June 1991 was short and with few casualties. However, the Croatian War of Independence in the latter half of 1991 brought many casualties and much damage on Croatian towns. As the war eventually subsided in Croatia, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina started in early 1992. Peace only came in 1995 after such events as the Srebrenica massacre, Operation Storm, Operation Mistral 2 and the Dayton Agreement, which provided for a temporary solution, but nothing was permanently resolved.

The economy suffered an enormous damage in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the affected parts of Croatia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also suffered an economic hardship under internationally imposed economic sanctions. Also many large historical cities were devastated by the wars, for example Sarajevo, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Mostar, Šibenik and others.

The wars caused large population migrations, mostly involuntary. With the exception of its former republics of Slovenia and Macedonia, the settlement and the national composition of population in all parts of Yugoslavia changed drastically, due to war, but also political pressure and threats. Because it was a conflict fueled by ethnic nationalism, people of minority ethnicities generally fled towards regions where their ethnicity was in a majority. Since the Bosniaks had no immediate refuge, they were arguably hardest hit by the ethnic violence. The United Nations tried to create &quot;safe areas&quot; for the Bosniak populations of eastern Bosnia but in cases such as the Srebrenica massacre, the peacekeeping troops (Dutch forces) failed to protect the &quot;safe areas&quot; resulting in the massacre of thousands. The Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia, fixating the borders between the warring parties roughly to the ones established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of population transfers following the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region. A number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia&#x27;s former president Slobodan Milošević, were put on trial by the United Nations&#x27; International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for a variety of war crimes—including deportations and genocide that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Croatia&#x27;s former president Franjo Tuđman and Bosnia&#x27;s Alija Izetbegović died before any alleged accusations were leveled at them at the ICTY. Slobodan Milošević died before his trial could be concluded.

Initial upsets on Kosovo did not escalate into a war until 1999 when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) was bombarded by NATO for 78 days with Kosovo being made a protectorate of international peacekeeping troops. A massive and systematic deportation of ethnic Albanians took place during the Kosovo War of 1999, with over one million Albanians (out of a population of about 1.8 million) forced to flee Kosovo. This was quickly reversed from the aftermath.

==2000 to present==

==Overview of state histories==

* Albania: The proto Albanians were likely a conglomerate of Illyrian tribes that resisted assimilation with later waves of migrations into the Balkans. The Ardiaean kingdom, with its capital in Scodra, is perhaps the best example of a centralized, ancient Illyrian state. After several conflicts with the Roman Republic, building up to the Third Illyrian War, Ardiaean as well as much of the region in Southeast Europe was brought into Roman rule for centuries onward. Its last ruler, King Gentius, being taken captive in 167 BC to Rome. After the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s collapse the territory of what is today Albania remained under Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations. It was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century. The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the Principality of Arbër and the Kingdom of Albania. The first records of the Albanian people as a distinct ethnicity also date to this period. Most of the coast of Albania was controlled by the Republic of Venice from the 10th century until the arrival of the Ottoman Turks (Albania Veneta), while the interior was ruled by Byzantians, Bulgarians or Serbs. Several Albanian principalities lead by Albanian feudals were created later, such as Balshaj, Principality of Kastrioti, Principality of Thopia, Muzaka, Morea etc. In the early 1400s the became targets of Ottoman expansion. In 1444 the League of Lezhë was created, lead by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, an Albanian militarist who was kidnapped by the Ottomans since childhood and served the Ottoman army. He betrayed the Ottomans and returned to his homeland. He united all Albanian principalities and aristocrats to start the rebellion against the Turks. Despite the long resistance of Skanderbeg with many battles won (First Siege of Krujë, Second Siege of Krujë, Battle of Albulena, Battle of Torvioll, Battle of Ohrid etc), the area was conquered in the end of the 15th century by the Ottoman Empire and remained under their control as part of the Rumelia province until 1912, when the first independent Albanian state was declared. The formation of an Albanian national consciousness dates to the later 19th century with the creation of the Albanian National Awakening in 1830, the League of Prizren in 1878 and several uprisings from 1909 to 1912. It is part of the larger phenomenon of rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire. After the independence, Albania suffered a period of instability and internal conflicts. During World War I Albania declared itself neutral, but still it was invaded by both Central Powers (Austria-Hungary) and the Entente (Third French Republic, Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Italy). In 1920 Albania regained its independence after the Vlora War, when the Albanians kicked out the Italians. Political stability was established in 1925 when Ahmed Zogu gained power and became president. In 1928 he established the Kingdom of Albania and proclaimed himself the King of Albania. He was called King Zog I. He made some modernisation laws, but many of them failed because of many conservative movements and the existence of feudalism. He cooperated with Fascist Italy until the Italian invasion of Albania. Albania became an Italian protectorate and joined the Axis powers in World War II. Anti-fascist movements started in Albania but they were very weak. After the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the German invasion of Greece Albania got new territories from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece. In 1942 the National Liberation Movement was established and its leader was Enver Hoxha. In 1943 Albania became a German puppet state. The LANÇ (the Albanian partisan war) started. A civil war started between nationalists of the Balli Kombëtar and the communist partisans. In 29 November 1944 the partisans took control of all Albania, marking the Liberation Day. Albania joined the Allies. After World War II, Enver Hoxha seized power. The Kingdom of Albania was disbanded and a communist republic was founded (People&#x27;s Republic of Albania and People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania. He implemented Stalinist policies. He implemented radical modernisation policies such as disbanding feudalism, elimination of high social classes and aristocratic titles, the electrifying of the country, creation of agricultural cooperatives, building of new roads, railways and new communist style buildings. Religion belief and practicing was banned, making Albania the first Atheist country in the world. Many people were killed for opposing the regime. Albania became isolated from the rest of the world. Enver Hoxha died in 1985, marking the beginning of the end of communism in Albania. In 1990 student demonstrations spread in many cities. In 1992 communism officially fell, starting an era of major challenges such as the Albanian Civil Unrest in 1997. Democratic reforms were done. Albania joined NATO in 2009 and now it is aiming to join the EU. 
* Bosnia and Herzegovina: The territory was divided between Croatia and Serbia in the Early Middle Ages. &quot;Bosnia&quot; itself was a Serbian polity according to the DAI. Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of Duklja in the 11th century. In time, Bosnia became separated under its own ruler. After 1101, Bosnia was detached from Duklja, and subsequently came under Hungarian suzerainty, as was the case with Croatia. Byzantine rule interrupted Hungarian rule, and under Byzantine suzerainty, the Banate of Bosnia came to existence. The later &quot;ban&quot; became a Hungarian nominal vassal. The Bosnian Church was a Christian church in Bosnia deemed heretical, which some rulers were adherents of. The rulers empowered themselves through trade with Ragusa, and gained lands from Serbia (Herzegovina). Bosnia reached its zenith under the rule of Tvrtko who took more lands, including parts of Dalmatia, and crowned himself as king in 1377. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, Bosnia followed. The Sanjak of Bosnia was established, and the local population was subject of Islamization during the following centuries by the Ottoman Empire which guaranteed more rights to Muslims. The ethnic tensions that arose in modern times stem from this religious division. Austria-Hungary took over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and annexed it in 1908. It was subsequently joined to Yugoslavia. After the Bosnian War, the state received international independence for the first time.
* Bulgaria: The Bulgars settled the Balkans permanently after 680. They invaded from northeast from the territories of Old Great Bulgaria and created the First Bulgarian Empire uniting with the numerous local Slavs. Bulgaria became officially Christian in the late 9th century. During the 9th and 10th century, Bulgaria at the height of its power spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea and became an important power in the region competing with the Byzantine Empire. It became the foremost cultural and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe throughout most of the Middle Ages thanks to the Golden Age of Bulgaria. The Cyrillic was developed in the Preslav Literary School in Bulgaria in the late 9th - beginning of the 10th century. The Bulgarian Church was recognized as autocephalous during the reign of Boris I of Bulgaria and became Patriarchate during tsar Simeon the Great, who greatly expanded the state over Byzantine territory. In 1018, Bulgaria became an autonomous theme in the Roman empire until the restoration by the Asen dynasty in 1185. In the 13th century Bulgaria was once again one of the powerful states in the region. By 1422 all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube became part of the Ottoman state, however local control remained in Bulgarian hands in many places. North of the Danube, Bulgarian Boyars continued to rule for the next three centuries. Bulgarian language continued to be used as the official language north of the Danube until the 19th century.
* Croatia: Following the settlement of Slavs in the Roman provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia, Croat tribes established two duchies. They were surrounded by the Franks (and later Venetians) and Avars (and later Magyars), while Byzantines tried to maintain control of the Dalmatian coast. The Kingdom of Croatia was founded in 925. It covered parts of Dalmatia, Bosnia and Pannonia. The state came under Papal (Catholic) influence. In 1102, Croatia entered a union with Hungary. Croatia was still considered a separate, albeit a vassal, kingdom. With the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, Croatia fell after successive battles, finalized in 1526. The remaining part then received Austrian rule and protection. Much of its border areas became part of the Military Frontier, inhabited and protected by Serbs, Vlachs, Croats and Germans since the area had previously become deserted. Croatia joined Yugoslavia in 1918–20. Independence was retained following the Croatian War.
* Greece: The oldest civilization of Europe - the non-Greek and non-Indo-European Minoan civilization. Greeks, an ancient ethnic and/or linguistic group (Athenians, Spartans, Peloponnesians, Thessalians, etc.) created the Mycenaean greek civilisation on the mainland (1600–1100 BC). The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes.
* Montenegro: In the 10th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, Travunia, and Serbia (&quot;Raška&quot;). In the mid-11th century Duklja attained independence through a revolt against the Byzantines; the Vojislavljević dynasty ruled as Serbian monarchs, having taken over territories of the former Serbian Principality. It then came under the rule of the Nemanjić dynasty of Serbia. By the 13th century, &quot;Zeta&quot; had replaced &quot;Duklja&quot; when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as &quot;Crna Gora&quot; (Venetian: &quot;&quot;). Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. The Republic of Venice dominated the coasts of today&#x27;s Montenegro from 1420 to 1797; the area around the Kotor became part of Venetian Albania. Parts were also briefly controlled by the First French Empire and Austria-Hungary in the 19th century. From 1696 until 1851 the metropolitans of Cetinje (of the House of Petrović-Njegoš) ruled the polity of Montenegro (Old Montenegro) alongside tribal rulers. The Petrović-Njegoš transformed Montenegro into a principality in 1851 and ruled until 1918. Independence of the Principality of Montenegro was received in 1878. From 1918, it was a part of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro became independent.
* North Macedonia: North Macedonia officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (, &quot;Den na nezavisnosta&quot;), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St. Elijah&#x27;s Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic.
* Serbia: Following the settlement of Slavs, the Serbs established several principalities, as described in the DAI. Serbia was elevated to a kingdom in 1217, and an empire in 1346. By the 16th century, the entire territory of modern-day Serbia was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire. In the early 19th century the Serbian Revolution re-established the Serbian state, pioneering in the abolition of feudalism in the Balkans. Serbia became the region&#x27;s first constitutional monarchy, and subsequently expanded its territory in the wars. The former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina united with the Kingdom of Serbia in 1918. Following World War I, Serbia formed Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples which existed in several forms up until 2006, when the country retrieved its independence.

<text>Robert Beck (born Robert Lee Maupin or Robert Moppins Jr.; August 4, 1918 – April 28, 1992), better known as Iceberg Slim, was an American pimp who later became a writer. Beck&#x27;s 1967 memoir, &quot;Pimp: The Story of My Life&quot; sold very well, mainly among Black audiences. By 1973, it had been reprinted 19 times and had sold nearly 2 million copies. Pimp was eventually translated into German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and Greek. He also wrote novels such as &quot;Trick Baby.&quot;

==Early life==
Maupin was born in Chicago, Illinois. He spent his childhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois, until he returned to Chicago. When his mother was abandoned by his father, she established a beauty shop and worked as a domestic hairstylist to support both of them in Milwaukee. In his autobiography, Maupin expressed gratitude to his mother for not also abandoning him. She earned enough money working in her salon to give her son the privileges of a middle-class life such as a college education, which at that time was difficult for the average person.

Slim attended Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama, but having spent time in street culture, he soon began bootlegging and was expelled as a result. After his expulsion, his mother encouraged him to become a criminal lawyer so that he could make a legitimate living while continuing to work with the street people he was so fond of, but Maupin, seeing the pimps bringing women into his mother&#x27;s beauty salon, was far more attracted to the lifestyle of money and control over women that pimping provided.

==Pimp activity==
According to his memoir, &quot;Pimp&quot;, Slim started pimping at 18 and continued until age 42. The book claims that during his career he had over 400 women, both black and white, working for him. He said he was known for his frosty temperament and for staying calm in emergencies, which, combined with his slim build, earned him the street name Iceberg Slim. When verbal instruction and psychological manipulation failed to keep the women compliant, he beat them with wire hangers; in his autobiography he concedes he was a ruthless, vicious man.

Slim had been connected with several other well-known pimps, one of them Albert &quot;Baby&quot; Bell, a man born in 1899 who had been pimping for decades and had a Duesenberg and a bejeweled pet ocelot. Another pimp, who had gotten Slim hooked on cocaine, went by the name of &quot;Satin&quot; and was a major drug figure in the eastern part of the country.

Throughout his pimping career, Slim, who was known as Cavanaugh Slim, was noted for being able to effectively conceal his emotions, something he said he learned from Baby Bell: &quot;A pimp has gotta know his whores, but not let them know him; he&#x27;s gotta be god all the way.&quot;

Iceberg Slim retired from pimping at the age of 42 because he could no longer handle the physical and mental stress of the job, particularly when it came to managing his prostitutes, who tended to have difficult personalities. In his words: &quot;I did not want to be teased, tormented, and brutalized by young whores.&quot;

==Prison stints==
At age 17, Slim convinced a girlfriend named in his memoir as &quot;June&quot; to work as a prostitute for him. His second customer recognized the girl and informed her father, and the father in turn contacted the police. Slim was sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison for &quot;carnal knowledge and abuse&quot;. June&#x27;s father used his influence to prevent Slim from being charged with &quot;pandering&quot; because he did not want his daughter to be labelled a prostitute. Slim served his sentence in Wisconsin Green Bay Reformatory.

Slim returned to Milwaukee after being released. Four and a half months after being paroled, a man named &quot;Weeping&quot; paid Slim $500 to have sex with a woman named &quot;Pepper&quot; at her house with the intent to secretly take photographs of the couple in bed and blackmail Pepper. But after Slim did the deed and was paid, he was arrested by police and accused of stealing the money from Pepper&#x27;s house. Pepper testified against Slim at his trial, and Slim was convicted of burglary and sentenced to two years in prison, which he served in Waupun State Prison. He was released three months early for good behavior. Slim stated he never found out why Weeping and Pepper framed him.

==Writing==
In 1961, after serving 10 months of solitary confinement in a Cook County jail, Maupin decided he was too old for a life of pimping at the age of 42 and was unable to compete with younger, more ruthless pimps.

In 1961, Maupin moved to Los Angeles and changed his name to Robert Beck, taking the last name of the man his mother was married to at the time. He met Betty Shue, who became his common-law wife and the mother of his three daughters, while he was working as an insecticide salesman. Betty encouraged Beck to write the story of his life as a novel, and they began sporadically writing some draft chapters. According to her, a white writer, whom Beck would later only refer to as &quot;the Professor&quot;, became interested in writing Beck&#x27;s life story; Beck became convinced that the man was trying to steal their idea for himself, so they cut him out of the deal and finished it without him. Bentley Morris of Holloway House recognized the merit of &quot;Pimp&quot;, and it was published in 1967.

The hip-hop writer Mark Skillz wrote that when Beck began work on &quot;Pimp&quot;, &quot;he made two promises to himself: no glamorizing his former life and no snitching.&quot; Hip hop artist Fab 5 Freddy, a friend of Beck&#x27;s, claimed that &quot;Many of Bob&#x27;s friends were still alive when he wrote that book. So he changed all of their names and descriptions. &#x27;Baby&#x27; Bell became &#x27;Sweet&#x27; Jones, his best friend &#x27;Satin&#x27; became &#x27;Glass Top&#x27;, and he created composite characters of some of his former &#x27;employees.

Reviews of &quot;Pimp&quot; were mixed. Beck&#x27;s vision was considerably bleaker than most other Black writers of the time; his work tended to be based on his personal experiences in the criminal underworld and revealed a world of seemingly bottomless brutality and viciousness. His was the first insider look into the world of Black pimps, to be followed by a half-dozen pimp memoirs by other writers.

In 1973, Hollie West questioned in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; whether societal changes and the women&#x27;s movement would soon render the outlook expressed in &quot;Pimp&quot; obsolete: &quot;The Iceberg Slim of yesteryear is considered an anachronism to the young dudes now out there on the block trying to hustle. They say he is crude and violent, overlooking his tremendous gift of the gab. Iceberg acknowledges that pimping has changed because &#x27;women have changed.&#x27; The advent of women&#x27;s lib, changing sexual mores, general affluence in this society and widespread use of drugs by pimps to control prostitutes have made an impact.&quot;
&quot;Pimp&quot; sold very well, mainly among Black audiences. By 1973, it had been reprinted 19 times and had sold nearly 2 million copies. &quot;Pimp&quot; was eventually translated into German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and Greek.

Following &quot;Pimp&quot;, Beck wrote several more novels, an autobiography, and a story collection. He sold over six million books before his death in 1992, making him one of the best-selling African-American writers.

===Recordings===
In 1976, Iceberg Slim released the album &quot;Reflections&quot;, in which he recited passages from his autobiography over a funky musical backing supplied by the Red Holloway Quartet. The album, produced by David Drozen, was initially released on ALA records. It was reissued by Infinite Zero in 1994, then by Uproar Entertainment in 2008. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Victor W. Valdivia wrote &quot;For those who aren&#x27;t easily offended, this album will be spellbinding. Slim&#x27;s skills as a storyteller cannot be overstated; even at his crudest, he still spins riveting yarns.&quot; Valdivia praised the record for &quot;the mixture of street smarts and the intellectual and emotional depth shown here&quot;, which, he said, was often lacking in Iceberg Slim&#x27;s followers.

An audiobook adaptation of his autobiography &quot;Pimp: The Story of My Life&quot;, narrated by Cary Hite, was released by Urban Audiobooks in 2011. Hite went on to voice other works of Iceberg Slim, including &quot;Long White Con&quot;, &quot;Trick Baby&quot;, and &quot;Airtight Willie and Me&quot;.

===Film adaptations===
Slim&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Trick Baby&quot;, was adapted as an eponymous 1972 movie directed by Larry Yust and produced independently for $600,000, with a cast of unknowns. Universal Pictures acquired the film for $1,000,000 and released it in 1973 to a considerable amount of Iceberg Slim fanfare; the movie grossed $11,000,000 at the US box office. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film for its depiction of race relations and the friendship between two con men, set &quot;in the grimier reaches of Philadelphia&quot;.
In 2006, independent film producers Dave Mortell and David Harb acquired the film rights to produce a film adaptation of &quot;Mama Black Widow&quot;. In 2008 Mos Def was contacted to play the character of Papa Tilson alongside Rihanna (in what would have been her acting debut in a feature film at the time), Kerry Washington and Macy Gray.

In 2009, television executive producer Rob Weiss, of the HBO show &quot;Entourage&quot;, and Mitch Davis purchased the film rights to produce a screen adaptation of &quot;Pimp&quot;.

==Personal life==
After his release from prison in 1961, Beck met Betty Shue, who became his common-law wife and the mother of his three daughters (Melody, Misty and Camille) and one son (Leon) while he was working as an insecticide salesman. Shue encouraged Beck to write his life story and helped him write drafts.

Beck married Diane Millman Beck in 1982.

==Death==
According to Beck&#x27;s widow, Diane Millman Beck, Beck&#x27;s final years were plagued by financial worries and deteriorating health. Beck suffered from diabetes and became increasingly reclusive. He died from liver failure in April 1992, aged 73. In 2005, Diane Millman Beck and Beck&#x27;s three daughters from his previous relationship, Melody, Misty and Camille, filed suit against Holloway House for back payment of royalties. They claimed in their suit that Robert Beck died penniless.

==Influence==
Scottish author Irvine Welsh said: &quot;Iceberg Slim did for the pimp what Jean Genet did for the homosexual and thief and William Burroughs did for the junkie: he articulated the thoughts and feelings of someone who had been there.&quot;

===Academia===
Welsh adds that a course at Harvard University featured &quot;Pimp&quot; as a &quot;transgressive novel&quot;.

===Comedy===
*In his special &quot;The Bird Revelation&quot;, comedian Dave Chappelle used the life of Iceberg Slim and the world of his book &quot;Pimp&quot; as a parable for his experience in show business.
* Eddie Murphy&#x27;s character Velvet Jones, from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, has been described as a spoof of Iceberg Slim.

===Films ===
*In 1970, incarcerated Bay Area pimp Robert Poole was influenced by Beck&#x27;s &quot;Pimp&quot; while writing a screenplay about his life, &quot;The Mack and His Pack&quot;. The film was released under the title &quot;The Mack&quot; (1973), starring Max Julien and Richard Pryor.
*Ice-T produced the documentary &quot;Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp&quot; (2012), told through talking-head admirers, including Chris Rock, Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, Henry Rollins, Quincy Jones, and others. The film was directed by Jorge Hinojosa and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012.

===Literature===
*Author Donald Goines acknowledged the strong influence of Beck&#x27;s &quot;Pimp&quot; when he created his urban fiction set in a black milieu. Goines was also published by Bentley Morris of Holloway House.
*Peter A. Muckley published &quot;Iceberg Slim: The Life as Art&quot; (2003), a critical study of the fiction of Iceberg Slim.

===Music===
Slim is an important influence on hip-hop artists. For example:
*Many of the current musical references to pimp culture, for example in the work of Snoop Dogg and Too Short, can be traced back to Iceberg Slim.
*Iceberg Slim&#x27;s last book, &quot;Doom Fox&quot; (written in 1978 but not published until 1998), contains an introduction written by Ice-T.
*Spiceberg Slim is a moniker and the eighth studio album (released in 2002) by American rapper Spice 1.
*On Xiu Xiu&#x27;s album &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot;, the title track is subtitled &quot;(Mama Black Widow Version)&quot;.
*Australian rock band Doomfoxx adopted their name from the novel &quot;Doom Fox&quot;.
*Southern hip hop artist Killer Mike mentions having read Robert Beck on a 2024 track Bussin Bricks Intro.

<text>Jean Friesen (born July 30, 1943) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for thirteen years, and was a member of New Democratic Premier Gary Doer&#x27;s cabinet from 1999 to 2003.

Friesen was born in Oldham, Lancashire, in England, and moved to Canada at a young age, when her father, Reg Edwards, took up a teaching position at McGill University. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from McGill University and a PhD from the University of British Columbia during the 1960s. Friesen was employed by the National Museum of Canada from 1967 to 1973, and has been a faculty member in the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Department of History since that time. In 1991, she co-edited a work entitled &quot;Aboriginal Resource Use in Canada: Historical and Legal Aspects&quot;.

Friesen was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Harold Taylor by over one thousand votes in the central-Winnipeg riding of Wolseley. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Friesen joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. In the 1995 provincial election, she was re-elected for Wolseley in a landslide. Also in 1995, she supported Lorne Nystrom for the federal New Democratic Party leadership.

The NDP were victorious in the election of 1999, and Friesen again scored an easy victory in her own riding. She was appointed Deputy Premier of Manitoba and Minister of Intergovernment Affairs on October 5, 1999, also receiving ministerial responsibility for Cooperative Development on September 25, 2002. Also in 2002, she defended the provincial government&#x27;s controversial decision to spray malathion in the Winnipeg area, as a means of controlling the city&#x27;s insect population during an outbreak of West Nile fever.

In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

Friesen did not run for re-election in 2003, and formally stepped down from cabinet on June 25 of that year. She has subsequently returned to her teaching position at the University of Manitoba, and in 2004 issued a work entitled &quot;Magnificent Gifts: The Treaties of Canada with Indians of the Northwest, 1869-76&quot;.

<text>Eleanor Joanna Waley-Cohen (born 10 June 1952) is an English academic who is Provost for New York University Shanghai and Silver Professor of History at New York University, where she has taught Chinese history since 1992. As Provost, she serves as NYU Shanghai&#x27;s chief academic officer, setting the university&#x27;s academic strategy and priorities, and overseeing academic appointments, research, and faculty affairs.

Her research interests include early modern Chinese history, especially the Qing dynasty; China and the West; and Chinese imperial culture, especially in the Qianlong era; warfare in China and Inner Asia; Chinese culinary history.

==Early life==
Waley-Cohen was born in 1952 at Westminster Hospital in London, the daughter of Sir Bernard Waley-Cohen, Baronet and Hon. Joyce Nathan. She was born into a prominent Anglo-Jewish family, the granddaughter of Sir Robert Waley Cohen and Lord Nathan.

==Career==
Waley-Cohen received her B.A. and M.A. degrees in Chinese Studies from Cambridge University, then took a degree in law. When she moved with her husband to the United States, she could not practice law, and enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Yale University, receiving her degree in 1987.

Waley-Cohen&#x27;s books include &quot;The Culture of War in China: Empire and the Military under the Qing Dynasty&quot; (I.B. Tauris, 2006); &quot;The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History&quot; (W.W. Norton, 1999); and &quot;Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang, 1758-1820&quot; (Yale University Press, 1991). Her current scholarly projects include a revised history of imperialism in China, a study of daily life in China c.1800, and a history of culinary culture in early modern China.

==Influence and reception==

Nicholas D. Kristof welcomed &quot;Sextants &quot;in the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;sensibly organized and engagingly told&quot; but &quot;In the end, I disagreed with much of the thesis of this book, but that is not to say that I disliked it. On the contrary, I probably liked it more for disagreeing with it. Partly because of the boldness of the argument, it is stimulating and refreshing...&quot;

Her 2003 article &quot;New Qing History&quot; summarized American revisionist scholarship in history of the Qing dynasty and gave it the name New Qing History which has come into widespread use.

<text>John Edgell Rickword, MC (22 October 1898 – 15 March 1982) was an English poet, critic, journalist and literary editor. He became one of the leading communist intellectuals active in the 1930s.

==Early life==
Rickword was born in Colchester, Essex, the fifth and last child of George Rickword, borough librarian, and his wife Mabel, née Prosser. After a dame school, he attended the local grammar school. He served in the British Army in World War I, having joined the Artists&#x27; Rifles in 1916, before being commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Berkshire Regiment in October 1917. Almost exactly a year later, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC), the citation for which reads:

He was a published war poet, and collected his early verse in &quot;Behind the Eyes&quot; (1921).

On 4 January 1919, Rickword developed an illness that was diagnosed as a &quot;general vascular invasion which had resulted in general septicaemia&quot;. His left eye was so badly infected that they thought it necessary to remove it to prevent the infection from spreading to the other eye.

He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1919, staying only four terms reading French literature, and leaving when he married. Literary friends from this period included mainly other ex-soldiers: Anthony Bertram, Edmund Blunden, Vivian de Sola Pinto, A. E. Coppard, Louis Golding, Robert Graves, L. P. Hartley and Alan Porter. His work appeared in the &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot; 1921 anthology, with Blunden, Golding, Porter, Graves, Richard Hughes and Frank Prewett.

==Critic==

He then took up literary work in London. He reviewed for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, which led to a celebrated review of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. J. C. Squire published him in the &quot;London Mercury&quot;, and Desmond MacCarthy as literary editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; gave him work.

He started the &quot;Calendar of Modern Letters&quot; literary review, now highly regarded, in March 1925. It lasted until July 1927, assisted by Douglas Garman and then Bertram Higgins, and contributions from his cousin C. H. Rickword. The &quot;Scrutinies&quot; books of collected pieces from it were a &quot;succes d&#x27;estime&quot;; the purpose of the publication was a mass killing of the sacred cows of Edwardian literature (G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, John Masefield, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells). Its undoubted influence as a precursor of later criticism was very marked in the early days of &quot;Scrutiny&quot;, the magazine founded a few years later by F. R. Leavis and Q. D. Leavis. Rickword also wrote for that publication.

==Communist==

He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1934, and became increasingly active in political work during the period of the Spanish Civil War; while still writing poetry. He was friendly with Randall Swingler, the &#x27;official&#x27; poetry voice of the CPGB, and with Jack Lindsay, his only real rival as a theoretician. He was closely connected with the leading cultural figures on the hard Left, such as Mulk Raj Anand, Ralph Winston Fox, Julius Lipton, A. L. Morton, Sylvia Townsend Warner and Alick West. When Lawrence &amp; Wishart was created as the official CPGB publishing house, in 1936, Rickword became a director. It was through Rickword that Lawrence &amp; Wishart published Nancy Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Negro: An Anthology&quot;, though at her own expense.

At that same period he was a co-founder of the &quot;Left Review&quot;, which he edited. His associates included James Boswell, who was the art editor; they had met around 1929. &quot;Left Review&quot; existed from 1934 to 1938, was set up by Rickword and Douglas Garman, had as writers both CPGB members and notable figures outside the party, and founded Marxist criticism in the UK.

Later he became editor of &quot;Our Time&quot;, the Communist review, from 1944 to 1947, working with Arnold Rattenbury and David Holbrook. Rickword had an upbeat view at the time on the possibilities of popular culture and radical politics, and the circulation rose as he broadened the publication&#x27;s scope from popular political poetry. The post-war clique around &quot;Our Time&quot;, the Salisbury Group (named for a pub), included Christopher Hill, Charles Hobday, Holbrook, Mervyn Jones, Lindsay, Rattenbury, Montagu Slater, Swingler, E. P. Thompson; and Doris Lessing joined it.

In 1949, writing a preface to Christopher Caudwell&#x27;s &quot;Further Studies in a Dying Culture,&quot; Rickword stated that themes of Caudwell&#x27;s essay is &quot;the unity of thinking and doing, the nullity of either in isolation.&quot; Further, Rickword wrote that Caudwell here &quot;reminds us that poetry and art were as essential to his sense of fitness as bread and air.&quot;

<doc id="994347" wikidata="Q11509815" url="?curid=994347" title="Nissan VG engine">
<text>The VG engine is a family of V6 engines designed and produced by Nissan between 1983 and 2004. 

Nissan&#x27;s and Japan&#x27;s first mass-produced V6, the iron block/aluminum head 60° VG engine was produced in displacements between 2.0 and 3.3 liters. Early versions used SOHC cylinder heads with two valves per cylinder; later models featured DOHC cylinder heads, four valves per cylinder, a slightly different engine block and N-VCT, Nissan&#x27;s own version of variable valve timing, delivering a smoother idle and more torque at low to medium engine speeds. 

Both production blocks and head castings were used successfully in the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90 race cars which won the IMSA GT Championship three years in a row.

==Origins==
Development of the &quot;VG&quot; series began in 1979 by Nissan Machinery, a former member of the Nissan Group &quot;keiretsu&quot;. The objective was to replace the inline 6 Nissan L engine, which traces its roots back to the Mercedes-Benz M180 engine introduced in 1951, with an all-new V6. 

Nissan engineers wanted the &quot;VG&quot; to have improved performance, fuel economy, reliability, and refinement, while being both lighter and more compact than its predecessor. The resulting engine was designed by Nissan from scratch, and shared few mechanical components with its predecessor, or with any other automaker. It was added to a new engine family name PLASMA (Powerful ＆ Economic, Lightweight, Accurate, Silent, Mighty, Advanced).

Extensive computer design techniques were used during development, which made the &quot;VG&quot; series one of the most advanced and high-tech engines of its day. It featured a sequential multi-port fuel injection system, and Nissan&#x27;s Electronic Concentrated Control System (ECCS).

ECCS used a microprocessor and an oxygen sensor to control fuel delivery, spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation rate, and engine idle speed, depending on the current operating conditions of the engine. This system reduced carbon emissions, improved fuel economy, and improved engine performance during cold-start and warm-up conditions.

The advantages of the &quot;VG&quot; engine over its inline 6 predecessor was that its V6 configuration would have greater torsional rigidity for higher performance potential, and its shorter length would give Nissan designers and engineers more freedom for vehicle design, allowing for both more frontal crush zone space and transverse mounting for front-wheel-drive vehicles.

All &quot;VG&quot; engines use a timing belt to synchronize the camshafts with the crankshaft rather than a timing chain. The &quot;VG&quot; series engine was put into thousands of Nissan vehicles, debuting in Japan in the 1983 Nissan Gloria/Nissan Cedric, and in the US and other markets in the 1984 Nissan 300ZX.

When the Nissan VQ engine was introduced in 1994, the &quot;VG&quot; engine was slowly phased out in Nissan cars, and after 2002 it was only available in the Nissan Frontier and Nissan Xterra. The &quot;VG&quot; engine was retired in 2004, by which time all V6-powered Nissans had switched to the VQ.

==VG20E==
The VG20E is a SOHC engine produced from 1984 on. It produces between and net. In the earlier gross rating system, early eighties&#x27; models claim .

Applications:
* 1983–1987 Nissan Gloria/Nissan Cedric Y30
* 1987–1999 Nissan Gloria/Nissan Cedric Wagon/Van Y30
* 1986-1988 Nissan Bluebird Maxima U11

==VG20ET==

The VG20ET was based on the VG20E, but with an added an Variable-geometry turbocharger. The VG20ET produces . This SOHC motor debuted at the same time as the VG20E. Also coming with the Y30, this motor was known as the &quot;Jet Turbo&quot;, and came with the Nissan Leopard models XS, and XS-II Grand Selection. Contrary to the VG30ET that came out in the US, the VG20ET came with an intercooler in certain models to push the horsepower output to , a great jump from the normally aspirated VG20E. The turbo included with the VG20ET had two different settings. At low speeds, the turbo&#x27;s wastegate would stay closed improving the response at low rpm. At high speeds, the flap would stay open, decreasing resistance and increasing exhaust flow. At its maximum flow, the flap would open at an angle of 27 degrees, while the A/R ranged from 0.21–0.77. Being that the VG20ET had a short stroke , it was thought to have insufficient low end torque. Nevertheless, the VG20ET was a great improvement over the VG20E.

There are two versions of the VG30DE. The first was introduced in 1986 on the Japanese 300ZR (Z31) and Nissan Leopard F31, and were never sold in North America. The VG30DE has two throttle bodies facing the front of the vehicle (Nissan 300ZX and Fairlady Z) or two throttle bodies to the left (sedans and 300ZR). It was also installed with N-VTC, an early form of variable valve timing.

Early VG30DEs used large oval intake ports, and round exhaust ports, though the flange was similar to the SOHC VG engine, bolt spacing was slightly different. Late VG30DE&#x27;s used slightly smaller oval intake ports, and oval exhaust ports. The bolt spacing was shared with the round-port variant from earlier years.

<doc id="994361" wikidata="Q7041073" url="?curid=994361" title="Nissan VE engine">
<text>The VE engine is a piston V6 engine from Nissan. It is based on the Nissan VG engine and was only used for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 model years. This engine has an iron block, aluminum cylinder heads with 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing on the intake camshafts, coil-on-plug ignition, and an available variable intake manifold (5-speed only). Additionally, the engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio, a cylinder bore of 87.0 mm, and a piston stroke of 83.0 mm.

The most significant difference between the VE30DE and the VG30DE engine are the heads. The low under-hood clearance on the 1992–1994 J30 Nissan Maxima demanded a special head to be developed with 30°, rather than 46°, between the valves. Lack of space also demanded a redesigned camshaft drive system, so a special chain drive was developed. The camshafts are driven by a single primary and two secondary chains. The engine is otherwise similar to the VG30DE.

==VE30DE==
The VE30DE produces at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm. This engine redlines at 6600 rpm. It was built from July, 1991 through March, 1994.
It is used in the following vehicle:

<doc id="994363" wikidata="Q1484575" url="?curid=994363" title="Jaguar C-Type">
<text>The Jaguar C-Type (officially called the Jaguar XK120-C) is a racing sports car built by Jaguar and sold from 1951 to 1953. The &quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;competition&quot;.

The car combined the running gear of the contemporary, road-proven XK120, with a lightweight tubular frame designed by Jaguar Chief Engineer William Heynes, and an aerodynamic aluminium body, jointly developed by William Heynes, R J (Bob) Knight and later Malcolm Sayer. A total of 53 C-Types were built, 43 of which were sold to private owners, mainly in the US.

==Specification==

The road-going XK120&#x27;s 3.4-litre twin-cam, straight-six engine produced between 160 and . The C-Type version was originally tuned to around . The early C-Types were fitted with SU carburettors and drum brakes. Later C-Types, produced from mid 1953, were more powerful, using triple twin-choke Weber carburettors and high-lift camshafts. They were also lighter, and braking performance was improved by using disc brakes on all four wheels. The lightweight, multi-tubular, triangulated frame was designed by Heynes. Heynes, Knight and Sayer together developed the aerodynamic body. Made of aluminium in the barchetta style, it was devoid of road-going items such as carpets, weather equipment and exterior door handles. According to the Jaguar Heritage Registry, the cars were produced between May 1952, starting with XKC001, and ending in August 1953 with XK054. The original alloy body was marked with the prefix K (e.g. K1037).

==Racing==
The C-Type was successful in racing, most notably at the Le Mans 24 hours race, which it won twice.

In 1951, the car won at its first attempt. The factory entered three, whose driver pairings were Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman, Leslie Johnson and triple Mille Miglia winner Clemente Biondetti, and the eventual winners, Peter Walker and Peter Whitehead. The Walker-Whitehead car was the only factory entry to finish, the other two retiring with lack of oil pressure. A privately entered XK120, owned by Robert Lawrie, co-driven by Ivan Waller, also completed the race, finishing 11th.

In 1952, Jaguar, worried by a report about the speed of the Mercedes-Benz 300SLs that would run at Le Mans, modified the C-Type&#x27;s aerodynamics to increase the top speed. However, the consequent rearrangement of the cooling system made the cars vulnerable to overheating, and all three retired from the race. The Peter Whitehead-Ian Stewart and Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton cars blew head gaskets, and the Stirling Moss-Peter Walker car, the only one not overheating having had a full-sized radiator hurriedly fitted, lost oil pressure after a mechanical breakage. Testing by Norman Dewis at MIRA after the race proved that the overheating was caused more by the revisions to the cooling system than by the altered aerodynamics: the water pump pulley was undersized, so it was spinning too fast and causing cavitation; also the header tank was in front of the passenger-side bulkhead, far from the radiator, and the tubing diameter was too small at 7/8 inch. With the pump pulley enlarged, and the tubing increased to -inch, the problem was eliminated. The main drawback of the new body shape was that it reduced downforce on the tail to the extent that it caused lift and directional instability at speeds over on the Mulsanne Straight. These cars had chassis numbers XKC 001, 002 and 011. The first two were dismantled at the factory, and the third survives in normal C-type form.

In 1953, C-Types won again, and also placed second and fourth. This time the body was in thinner, lighter aluminium and the original twin H8 sand cast SU carburettors were replaced by three DCO3 40mm Webers, which helped boost power to . Philip Porter mentions additional changes:
Further weight was saved by using a rubber bag fuel tank ... lighter electrical equipment and thinner gauge steel for some of the chassis tubes ... [T]he most significant change to the cars were the triple Weber carburetors and [switch to] disc brakes.
Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt won the race at – the first time Le Mans had been won at an average of over .
Disc brakes were novel in 1953, and Jaguar&#x27;s win, partly due to their superiority, set off a scramble to include discs in production cars.

1954, the C-Type&#x27;s final year at Le Mans, saw a fourth place by the Ecurie Francorchamps entry driven by Roger Laurent and Jacques Swaters.

==Values==
When new, the car sold for about $6,000, approximately twice the price of an XK120. In an article in the 11 June 2003 issue of &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine (&quot;Slick Cat Jaguar&quot;, p. 70) the value of a &quot;genuine, healthy&quot; C-Type is estimated as £400,000, and the value of the 1953 Le Mans winner is about £2 million; replicas are available from a variety of sources from £40,000. A C-Type once owned and raced by Phil Hill sold at an American auction in August 2009 for $2,530,000 and another C-type was sold at the Pebble Beach auction in 2012 for $3,725,000, Recently an unrestored C-Type that raced at Le Mans has sold for £5,715,580, during the Grand Prix Historique race meeting in Monaco. In August 2015, an ex-Ecurie Ecosse Lightweight C-type, chassis XKC052 and the second of only three works lightweights, driven by Peter Whitehead and Ian Stewart to fourth at the 1953 Le Mans 24 Hours, fetched $13.2 million (£8.4 million) at auction in California.

<doc id="994370" wikidata="Q541370" url="?curid=994370" title="Processor Direct Slot">
<text>A processor direct slot (PDS) is a slot incorporated into many older Macintosh models that allowed direct access to the signal pins of a CPU, similar to the functionality of a local bus in PCs. This would result in much higher speeds than having to go through a bus layer, such as NuBus, which typically ran at a slower 10 MHz speed.

== Overview ==
Typically, if a machine had bus expansion slots it would feature multiple bus expansions slots. However, there was never more than one PDS slot, as rather than providing a sophisticated communication protocol with &quot;arbitration&quot; between different bits of hardware that might be trying to use the communication channel at the same time, the PDS slot, for the most part, just gave direct access to signal pins on the CPU, making it closer in nature to a local bus.

Thus, PDS slots tended to be CPU-specific, and therefore a card designed for the PDS slot in the Motorola 68030-based Macintosh SE/30, for example, would not work in the Motorola 68040-based Quadra 700.

The one notable exception to this was the PDS design for the original Motorola 68020-based Macintosh LC. This was Apple&#x27;s first attempt at a &quot;low-cost&quot; Mac, and it was such a success that, when subsequent models replaced the CPU with a 68030, a 68040, and later a PowerPC processor, Apple found methods to keep the PDS slot compatible with the original LC, so that the same expansion cards would continue to work.

== History ==

=== SE slot (Motorola 68000) ===
The SE &quot;System Expansion&quot; slot, introduced in the Macintosh SE in 1987, was the first processor direct slot, using a 96-pin Euro-DIN connector to interface with the Motorola 68000 processor. This slot was also used in the Macintosh Portable.

=== IIci cache slot (Motorola 68030) ===
The L2 cache slot of the Macintosh IIci, introduced in 1989, was a 32-bit version of a PDS which used a 120-pin Euro-DIN connector to support the Motorola 68030 processor. This slot also appeared in the IIvi, and IIvx. These allowed for 3rd party companies, such as DayStar Digital, to develop processor upgrades that did not require the removal of the CPU.
The IIci cache slot is different from the other PDS slot as it doesn&#x27;t have provision for external connectors, and it does not include an interrupt request signal, thus limiting its use. Its pin configuration is also completely different from the one in most later MC68030-based non-LC Macintoshes.

=== IIsi, SE/30 slot (Motorola 68030) ===
The Macintosh SE/30 included a PDS slot that uses the same 120-pin Euro-Din connector as the IIci, but a different pin configuration. The primary clock is the 16 MHz clock for the CPU. Unlike the IIci cache slot, it includes three interrupt request signals. There is also provision in the case for external connectors, so it was commonly used for graphic or network devices.
The Macintosh IIsi included a motherboard slot very similar to the SE/30, although clocked at 20 MHz like the onboard MC68030. This slot was not intended for direct use, Apple instead offered two adapter cards with a second connector mounted at a right angle (so the board would be parallel to the motherboard). One card provided a NuBus slot, while the other was essentially a pass-though configuration enabling a slot very similar to the IIsi, but with only one interrupt signal supported. Both cards also included an MC68882 FPU, which was not present on the IIsi motherboard.

=== IIfx PDS (Motorola 68030) ===
The Macintosh IIfx, introduced in 1990, included a PDS that was almost identical to the SE/30 and IIsi, but not entirely. In particular, the clock signal is running at 20 MHz like the IIsi but the CPU is running at 40 MHz. The clock signal is also on a different pin from the IIsi and SE/30. Unlike other PDS, the connections to the processor signals are not direct, with intermediate buffering needed to handle the different clocks based on the physical address requested - some address would be accessed with the 20 MHz clock, and some other with the (not directly available on the slot) 40 MHz CPU clock (&quot;fast slot space&quot;). The physical space available for the board was also different from the SE/30 and IIsi.

=== LC slot (Motorola 68020/68030) ===
The LC slot, introduced in 1990, began as a PDS for the Motorola 68020 / 68030 processors in the Macintosh LC / LC II. It only supported the asynchronous cycle of the MC68020, and did not connect all address signals, though it did connect all 32 data signals. The 96-pin Euro-DIN connector is similar to the SE slot connector, but the two are completely incompatible. Latter models added 18 more pins through a notched in-line extension to support the full MC68030 bus (synchronous cycle, all address lines, clock both from the CPU and backward-compatible 16 MHz), while retaining backwards compatibility with older cards. This configuration proved to be so popular for Apple&#x27;s Performa line that later 68040 such as the Macintosh LC 475 and PowerPC-based versions were essentially emulating the 68030 pin signals for the LC slots that they inherited.

=== Quadra PDS (Motorola 68040) ===
The Macintosh Quadra series was introduced in 1991 with a new PDS for the Motorola 68040 processor which was in-line with one of the NuBus slots. The Quadra 605 and Quadra 630 were exceptions which used the full 114-pins version of the LC slot. Both allowed for PowerPC upgrades, including through the &quot;Ready for PowerPC upgrade&quot; program, using Apple&#x27;s Macintosh Processor Upgrade Card.

=== Duo Dock connector (Motorola 68030 / NuBus) ===
The PowerBook Duo line was introduced in 1992 with a unique 68030-based connector that could allow the subnotebook logic board to communicate with an array of desktop docking systems, some of which could be upgraded with floating-point units. Because of the complexity of larger Duo Docks, NuBus was used to manage parts of the subsystems.

=== Power Macintosh PDS (PowerPC 601) ===
First generation Power Macintosh systems with NuBus architecture, such as the 6100, 7100, and 8100, included a PDS that was used for high-speed AV cards. It was later used by third-party manufacturers to support PowerPC G3 and G4 upgrades.

=== PowerPC daughtercard slot ===
High-end second generation Power Macintosh systems with PCI architecture, such as the 7500 through 9600, had their PowerPC 601 and 604 processors on daughtercards which could be swapped out for PowerPC G3 and G4 upgrades.

=== PowerPC cache slot ===
Mid-range Power Macintosh systems based on PowerPC 603e processors with PCI architecture, such as the 5400, 5500, and 6360 through 6500, featured an L2 cache slot which provided direct access to the CPU. This allowed enterprising third-party manufacturers to build PowerPC G3 upgrades for this slot.

More recent Macs have such high processor speeds that a PDS would not be practical and instead adopted PCIe and Thunderbolt (interface). The last implementation resembling such a slot by Apple is the processor tray connector in the 2009 to 2012 Mac Pros. More recent models have had Intel Xeon processors socketed directly to the logic board.

<doc id="994375" wikidata="Q7730097" url="?curid=994375" title="The Diane Rehm Show">
<text>The Diane Rehm Show was a call-in show based in the United States that aired nationally on NPR (National Public Radio). In October 2007, &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; was named to the Audience Research Analysis list of the top ten most powerful national programs in public radio, the only talk show on the list. ACT 1 Systems Inc., using Nielsen audience data, estimated that the program (sometimes shortened to &quot;The DR Show&quot;) at that time had &quot;1.7 million listeners,&quot; a number that was later revised upward to 2.4 million listeners in December 2015. It was produced by WAMU and hosted by Diane Rehm. The show debuted on WAMU in the 1970s as &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, a weekday morning arts and discussion program. Diane took over as host in 1979, and the show became &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; in 1984. The final broadcast of &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; was aired on December 23, 2016. As of January 2, 2017, WAMU broadcasts 1A in the same timeslot.

== Format ==
The show aired live Monday through Friday from 10:00 to 12:00 EST, but some local stations re-aired it at later times. The first hour of the show was an in-depth discussion of a topic or theme in the news. Occasionally, it was an interview with a newsmaker. Two examples of past show topics for the first hour include &quot;European &amp; Arab Media on the U.S. in Iraq&quot; and &quot;Drug-Resistant Bacteria&quot;. The second hour was either an interview with an author about a book or a segment of general interest. The books could be fiction or nonfiction and covered a wide range of subjects and opinions. Occasionally, Rehm allowed callers to call in and interact with the author directly, often resulting in a lively debate. 

There were also recurring features. Each Friday, there was a two-hour weekly &quot;News Roundup&quot; where the major national and international headlines of the past week were discussed by reporters. The first hour was devoted to domestic American news, the second to international stories. A (usually) monthly &quot;Reader&#x27;s Review&quot; was when older books are reviewed and discussed.

The show was produced by Sandra Pinkard, Nancy Robertson, Susan Nabors and Denise Couture, Monique Nazareth and Sarah Ashworth. The engineers were Tobey Schreiner, Jonathan Charry, Timothy Olmstead, and Andrew Chadwick. Natalie Yuravlivker answered the phones. Streaming recordings of the show are available via the official web site.

== Host ==

Diane Rehm hosted the show from 1979, when it was titled &#x27;Kaleidoscope&#x27;; it was renamed for her in 1984. The show was sometimes guest hosted when Rehm was out for treatment for her spasmodic dysphonia, by a rotating list of NPR and NPR-related hosts including Susan Page, Tom Gjelten, Steve Roberts, Terence Smith, Frank Sesno, Andrea Seabrook, and Katty Kay. In March 2007, Rehm missed shows due to a bout of pneumonia. In March 2007, Diane Rehm suffered severe and painful corneal burns when she sprayed perfume on her contact lens during a trip to Oklahoma City. Rehm said that she labeled the identical three-ounce tinted plastic bottles to show they held different solutions but that the labels became blurred and hard to read, especially without her lenses in.

From August 21 into September 2009, Susan Page, of &quot;USA Today&quot;, filled in for the sidelined host, initially reporting that Rehm &quot;caught her heel in the hem of her slacks while she was dashing across the street yesterday afternoon, and she cracked her pelvis when she fell.&quot; Rehm&#x27;s spasmodic dysphonia has also required her to miss several shows in recent years.

Rehm announced her retirement from the show on December 8, 2015. The final broadcast of &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; was aired on December 23, 2016.

== Awards ==

Awards won include: the 2002 New York Festival Bronze World Medal for Best Regularly Scheduled Talk Program Interview, the 2002 American Bar Association Silver Gavel Honorable Mention, the 1999 New York Festival&#x27;s Bronze World Medal, and two 1999 American Women in Radio and Television first place Gracie Allen Awards. In 2009, Diane Rehm won a coveted George Foster Peabody Award.

<doc id="994394" wikidata="Q11509806" url="?curid=994394" title="Nissan QR engine">
<text>The QR family of inline-four piston engines by Nissan were introduced in 2000 and range from in displacement. These motors are aluminum, dual overhead camshaft (DOHC), four-valve designs with variable valve timing and optional direct injection. The engine shares much of its architecture with the YD diesel engine.

==QR20DE==
The QR20DE produces at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. The bore and stroke is and a compression ratio of 9.9:1. The QR20DE was replaced with the MR20DE engine in most applications in early 2005.

Vehicle applications:
* 2001-2007 Nissan X-Trail T30, 
* 2001-2007 Nissan Primera P12
* 2002–present Nissan Serena C24,

==QR25DE==

The QR25DE is a variant built with cast steel connecting rods, a steel timing chain, counter-rotating balance shafts, and an aluminum intake manifold. The engine bore and stroke is and a compression ratio ranging from 9.5:1 to 10.5:1 depending on the vehicle.

Output is rated at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm in the Altima 2.5 and Sentra SE-R models. The Sentra SE-R Spec V originally claimed 180 hp, but this was adjusted downward to 175 once production started in late 2001. The redline is 6100 rpm. Altimas that are PZEV compliant create and of torque. In the 2005+ Nissan Frontier the QR25DE generates and of torque.

===2007+ QR25DE===
The revised QR25DE found in the 2007+ Sentra, Altima, Rogue, etc. has a number of improvements over the older QR25DE. These include:
* A simpler, larger diameter single path resin intake manifold replaced the old dual path design. (Note: California emissions models do have a swirl control valve located in the intake)
* Revised piston crown shape to support a higher compression ratio of 9.6:1.(10.5:1 in Sentra SE-R Spec V.)
* The balancer system has been moved back slightly from the crank pulley to a more centric location in the block.
* Revised cam shaft profile.
* Reinforced connecting rods only available in the Sentra SE-R Spec V 2007-2012 .

<text>MCHotDog (; born April 10, 1978) is a Taiwanese rap artist and best known as “The Father of Taiwanese Hip Hop Music”. He is also known for his use of explicit lyrics in his songs.

In 2001, his four mini-CDs sold over 220,000 copies. In 2004, he toured with Chang Chen-yue in the North American Kill Kitty tour. In 2006, MCHotDog released an album &quot;Wake Up&quot;, which contains hit song 「我愛臺妹」 (I Love Taiwanese Girls). 「我愛臺妹」 is currently featured in a commercial for Kuang Chuan Tea Time. It sampled Glenn Frey&#x27;s &quot;The One You Love&quot; and The Spinners (American group)&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot;. The track won &quot;Best Karaoke Song&quot; at the 2007 HITO Radio Music Awards, presented by Taiwanese radio station Hit FM. &quot;Wake Up&quot; was both a critically acclaimed album as well as a commercial success, as it provided MCHotDog with crossover appeal. In 2008, MCHotDog released a new album called &quot;Mr. Almost&quot;.

He has been a judge on The Rap of China television show.

==Career==
MC HotDog&#x27;s career began when he was a student at Fu Jen Catholic University, which he attended from 1996 to 2001. During this period, he self-published his music through the website &quot;Master U&quot;. These songs attracted significant attention from the Mandarin-speaking hip hop community, leading HotDog to be regarded as Taiwan&#x27;s first underground rap artist. After performing at a 1999 concert, HotDog was introduced by the venue owner to figures from the Magic Stone Music label. He subsequently signed with Big Circus Music Studio, a subsidiary of Magic Stone that also represented artists like Dwagie, in 2000. Through Big Circus, HotDog released a sequence of four EPs throughout 2001, which collectively sold over 300,000 copies.

In 2002 and 2003, MC HotDog was unable to release any music, as he was performing his mandatory military service. However, after his discharge from the military, he rapidly began touring. In 2004 and 2005, HotDog supported Chang Chen-yue in tours throughout Taiwan, the United States and Hong Kong. He also performed at the 17th Golden Melody Awards in 2006.

MC HotDog released his first studio album, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, in January 2006. This album proved to be a critical success, winning Best Mandarin Album at the 18th Golden Melody Awards. HotDog also followed the album&#x27;s release with an April 2006 solo concert at Taipei World Trade Center II. MC HotDog followed &quot;Wake Up&quot; with the 2008 album &quot;Mr. Almost&quot; and the 2012 album &quot;Poverty Million Star&quot;.

In 2017, MC HotDog joined the cast of reality competition show &quot;The Rap of China&quot; as a judge. He continued to serve in this role for the show&#x27;s second and third seasons. HotDog also appeared as a contestant on the reality show &quot;Call Me by Fire&quot; in 2021.

MC HotDog served as an instructor for &quot;Rap for Youth&quot; in 2020.

MC HotDog won the Golden Melody Award for Best Male Mandarin Singer in 2024, for his album &quot;Disgusted Artist&quot;, as well as the Golden Melody Award for Best Lyricist for the song &quot;The Landlord Upstairs&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a 2014 interview, MC HotDog stated that during his youth he had taken drugs such as MDMA, marijuana and ketamine, but that he had since quit for the sake of his health.

<doc id="994402" wikidata="Q3545350" url="?curid=994402" title="Ottoman (furniture)">
<text>An ottoman is a piece of furniture. Generally, ottomans have neither backs nor arms. They may be an upholstered low couch or a smaller cushioned seat used as a table, stool or footstool. The seat may have hinges and a lid for the inside hollow, which can be used for storing linen, magazines, or other items, making it a form of storage furniture. The smaller version is usually placed near to an armchair or sofa as part of living room decor, or may be used as a fireside seat.

Ottoman footstools are often sold as coordinating furniture with armchairs, sofas, or gliders. Other names for this piece of furniture include footstool, hassock, pouf (sometimes spelled pouffe), in Shropshire, England, the old dialect word tumpty, and in Newfoundland humpty.

==History==
The ottoman traces its roots to furnishing practices in the Ottoman Empire in modern-day Turkey, where it was the central piece of residential seating, generally designed as a low wooden platform intended to be piled with cushions. It was first developed as sectional furniture that wrapped around three walls of a room, before evolving into smaller versions that fit into the corner of a room or circular padded seats surrounding a column or pole in a public room.

The ottoman was eventually brought to other parts of Europe from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century and named after its place of origin. The earliest known instance of the use of the name is &quot;ottomane&quot; in French in 1729. The first known recorded use in English occurs in one of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s memorandum books from 1789, &quot;P[ai]d. for an Ottomane of velours d&#x27;Utrecht.&quot;

Over the subsequent generation, the ottoman became a common piece of bedroom furniture. European ottomans standardized on a smaller size than the traditional Turkish ottoman, and in the 19th century they took on a circular or octagonal shape. The seat was divided in the center by arms or by a central, padded column that might hold a plant or statue. Hinged seats also began to appear, so that the space inside the ottoman could be used to store items.

The ottoman footstool, a closely allied piece of furniture, was an upholstered footstool on four legs, which could also be used as a fireside seat, the seat covered with carpet, embroidery, or beadwork. By the 20th century, the word ottoman encompassed both forms.

<text>James Allan Barcia (born February 25, 1952) is an American Democratic politician from Michigan. He has served successively in the Michigan House of Representatives, the Michigan Senate, the United States House of Representatives and then again the Michigan Senate, from which he was term-limited in January 2011. He has served as County Executive of Bay County, Michigan, since January, 2017.

==Early life and education==
Barcia was born in Bay City, Michigan, and graduated from Bay City Central High School. He received a B.A. from Saginaw Valley State University in 1974. He was staff assistant to United States Senator Philip A. Hart of Michigan in 1971. Barcia also was a community service coordinator for the Michigan Blood Center, between 1974 and 1975, and he was an administrative assistant to Michigan state representative Donald J. Albosta, from 1975 to 1976.

==Career==
Barcia was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, from 1977 to 1983. He left the House after being elected to the Michigan Senate, where he served until he resigned in 1993 to enter the United States House of Representatives.

Barcia was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district to the 103rd Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1993, to January 3, 2003. Like many Michigan Democrats outside of Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Flint, Barcia was more conservative than most Democrats, opposing abortion and gun control, and had a lifetime rating of 54 from the American Conservative Union—the highest of any Democrat from Michigan at the time.

After the United States 2000 Census, Barcia&#x27;s district was dismantled by the Republican-controlled state legislature. Most of his district&#x27;s territory was shifted to the 10th District, but his home in Bay City was merged with the neighboring 9th District of fellow Democrat Dale Kildee. The new district retained Barcia&#x27;s district number (the 5th), but was geographically more Kildee&#x27;s district. Under the circumstances, Barcia opted to run for his old seat in the State Senate and won.

On October 10, 2002, Jim Barcia was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

With Kildee announcing his retirement July 2011, Barcia considered running for his congressional seat in 2012.

In 2016, Barcia won a heated election to the position of Bay County Executive, after winning the Democratic primary against long-time incumbent Thomas L. Hickner in August. During the campaign, Barcia was accused of hiding campaign funds and using a misleading TV ad.

<doc id="994407" wikidata="Q538193" url="?curid=994407" title="Jesus wept">
<text>&quot;Jesus wept&quot; (, ) is a phrase famous for being the shortest verse in the King James Version of the Bible, as well as in many other translations. It is not the shortest in the original languages. The phrase is found in the Gospel of John, chapter 11, verse 35. Verse breaks—or versification—were introduced into the Greek text by Robert Estienne in 1551 in order to make the texts easier to cite and compare.

== Context ==

This verse occurs in John&#x27;s narrative of the death of Lazarus of Bethany, a follower of Jesus. Lazarus&#x27;s sisters—Mary and Martha—sent word to Jesus of their brother&#x27;s illness and impending death, but Jesus arrived four days after Lazarus died. Jesus, after talking to the grieving sisters and seeing Lazarus&#x27;s friends weeping, was deeply troubled and moved. After asking where Lazarus had been laid and being invited to come see him, Jesus wept. He then went to the tomb and told the people to remove the stone covering it, prayed aloud to his Father, and ordered Lazarus to come out, resurrected.

The Gospel of Luke also records that Jesus wept as he entered Jerusalem before his trial and death, anticipating the destruction of the Temple.

== Text ==

== Interpretation ==
Significance has been attributed to Jesus&#x27;s deep emotional response to his friends&#x27; weeping, and his own tears, including the following:
* Weeping demonstrates that Christ was a true man, with real bodily functions (such as tears, sweat, blood, eating and drinking—note, for comparison, the emphasis laid on Jesus&#x27; eating during the post-resurrection appearances). His emotions and reactions were real; Christ was not an illusion or spirit (see the heresy of Docetism). Pope Leo I referred to this passage when he discussed the two natures of Jesus: &quot;In His humanity Jesus wept for Lazarus; in His divinity he raised him from the dead.&quot;
* The sorrow, sympathy, and compassion Jesus felt for all mankind.
* The rage he felt against the tyranny of death over mankind.
* Although the bystanders interpreted his weeping to mean that Jesus loved Lazarus (verse 36), Witness Lee considered the Jews&#x27; opinion to be unreasonable, given Jesus&#x27; intention to resurrect Lazarus. Lee argued instead that every person to whom Jesus talked in John 11 (his disciples, Martha, Mary, and the Jews) was blinded by their misconceptions. Thus he &quot;groaned in his spirit&quot; because even those who were closest to him failed to recognize that he was, as he declared in verse 26, &quot;the resurrection and the life&quot;. Finally, at the graveside, he &quot;wept in sympathy with their sorrow over Lazarus&#x27; death&quot;.

== In history ==
Jesus&#x27;s tears have figured among the relics attributed to Jesus.

== Use as an expletive ==

In some parts of the English-speaking world, including Great Britain, Ireland (particularly Dublin and Belfast) and Australia, the phrase &quot;Jesus wept&quot; is an expletive some people use when something goes wrong or to express incredulity. In Christianity, this usage is considered blasphemous and offensive by the devout, as it is seen as violating the second or third of the Ten Commandments. Historically, certain Christian states had laws against profane use of Jesus Christ, among other religious terms. The Harris Poll conducted a 2017 study and found 90% of evangelical Christians would not view a film that disrespectfully used the name of Jesus Christ. In Catholic Christianity, the faithful pray Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ for abuse of the Holy Name, which constitutes a sin.

In 1965, broadcaster Richard Dimbleby accidentally used the expletive live on air during the state visit of Elizabeth II to West Germany.

It is a common expletive in novels by author Stephen King. Other authors using it as an expletive include Neil Gaiman in the &quot;Sandman&quot; series, Bernard Cornwell in the &quot;Sharpe&quot; series, Mick Herron in the Slough House series, David Lodge in &quot;Nice Work&quot;, Mike Carey in the &quot;Hellblazer&quot; series and &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, Garth Ennis in &quot;The Boys&quot;, Peter F. Hamilton in &quot;The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy&quot;, Mark Haddon in &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;, Dan Simmons in &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;, Minette Walters in &quot;Fox Evil,&quot; Elly Griffiths in the &quot;Dr Ruth Galloway&quot; series, and Jason Matthews in &quot;Red Sparrow&quot;.

This usage is also evidenced in films and television programmes including &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), &quot;Razorback&quot; (1984), &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (1987), &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; (1990), &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994), &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996), &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; (1996), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006), &quot;True Blood&quot;, &quot;Cranford&quot;, &quot;The Bank Job&quot; (all 2008), &quot;Blitz&quot; (2011), &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; (2013), &quot;Community&quot; (2015), &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (2016), &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, &quot;Derry Girls&quot; (both 2018), &quot;Troop Zero&quot; (2019), &quot;Silent Witness&quot; (2023), and &quot;Murder in a Small Town&quot; (2024).

Car journalist Jeremy Clarkson of the hit show &quot;Top Gear&quot; used the expletive many times during the show’s 22nd season.

The verse is also used in the The&#x27;s song &quot;Angels of Deception&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;Infected.&quot; 

Kanye West uses the verse to end &quot;Bound 2&quot;, the last song on his 2013 album &quot;Yeezus&quot;.

He is a three-time Emmy, two-time Golden Globe and one-time Grammy Award winner, as well as a two-time Screen Actors Guild Award nominee. Bridges also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to television. He is the son of actor Lloyd Bridges and elder brother of fellow actor Jeff Bridges.

==Early life==
Bridges was born on December 9, 1941 in Los Angeles, California, the son of actors Lloyd Bridges (1913–1998) and Dorothy Bridges (née Simpson; 1915–2009). He was nicknamed Beau by his parents after Ashley Wilkes&#x27; son in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. His younger brother is actor Jeff Bridges, and he has a younger sister, Lucinda. Another brother, Garrett, died in 1948 of sudden infant death syndrome. Beau has shared a close relationship with Jeff, for whom he acted as a surrogate father during childhood when their father was busy with work. He and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles.

Wanting to become a basketball star, he played in his freshman year at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under legendary coach John Wooden, where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He later transferred to the University of Hawaii. In 1959, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard Reserve and served for eight years.

In 1949 he played a third juvenile role in the film &quot;The Red Pony&quot;. In the 1962–1963 television season, Bridges, along with his younger brother, Jeff, appeared on their father&#x27;s CBS anthology series, &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;.

<doc id="994411" wikidata="Q1424180" url="?curid=994411" title="Zidane Tribal">
<text>is a video game character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and the main protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. He was conceived and written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, while his appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano and re-interpreted by Toshiyuki Itahana. Like other members of the &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; cast, but unlike characters of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, Zidane was designed after the plot for the game was written. Presented as a charming, puckish character, Zidane has an outgoing, self-confident and womanizing personality whose mixture of lechery and devil-may-care attitude helps put danger into perspective.

Zidane has appeared in the &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off series, and in smaller roles in various spin-off &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and crossover games. While some sources have criticized &quot;Final Fantasy IX&#x27;s&quot; art style and the visual design of its characters, Zidane is mostly well received, particularly in Japan where he is rated as one of the most popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters in fan polls. Various sources have commented on Zidane&#x27;s characterization being a departure from prior &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; protagonists who are known for being moody as well as his relationship with Garnet, while criticism was focused on his inconsistent character arc.

==Concept and creation==
Zidane, along with other characters, was designed after the creation of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;″s plot, unlike its predecessors, &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot;, which had its protagonists created before the story. He was one of the original three characters revealed, along with Vivi and Steiner. He was conceived and written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, while his appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano and re-interpreted by Toshiyuki Itahana. Both Zidane and Vivi&#x27;s size and age were less than that of the characters from &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot;. Zidane&#x27;s womanizing aspect was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. Sakaguchi described him as a person who &quot;likes girls and doesn&#x27;t care for much&quot;, lacking any real objective and being carefree, but a key character nonetheless. Kazuhiko Aoki regrets not developing how Zidane is afflicted by the difference in social status between him and Garnet. Illustrating the breakdown of relations with the nobles in Treno due to their disapproval of Zidane and Garnet&#x27;s relationship, Zidane butting up against the social confines he faces and the incredible power Garnet holds as royalty, and how Zidane gets back up on his feet despite all of that. Aoki believes he should have helped the team more to properly develop Zidane&#x27;s characterization.

Zidane has shoulder-length blonde hair, blue eyes, and a monkey-like tail that has prehensile capabilities, as seen in game when Zidane hangs from his tail to evade Steiner. He can either use two daggers or a single swallow-blade as weapons. In trance form, Zidane&#x27;s hair becomes longer, and his clothing is replaced with pink fur. Zidane is identified as a thief, and has the unique ability to steal items from enemies. As he is considered the main character of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, the stealing mechanic was made more important than in previous games, which means that players have ample opportunity to acquire a lot of valuable items earlier than normal through stealing them from enemies.

He was redesigned by Tetsuya Nomura in the video game &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;. As downloadable content, Nomura readapted Zidane&#x27;s black clothing from the ending of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; as an alternative costume. He is voiced by Romi Park and Bryce Papenbrook in the Japanese and English versions of &quot;Dissidia&quot; respectively. Papenbrook described Zidane as a &quot;really really fun character&quot;. In particular, he enjoys voicing Zidane as during his childhood he used to play the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games as well as the Square Enix game &quot;Bravely Default&quot;. For &quot;Dissdiia NT&quot; he in particular aims to bring a feeling sassiness in his lines while calling him &quot;snarky&quot; due to his womanizing traits. He was glad during a convention where he met a cosplayer of Zidane who expressed satisfaction with his performance in his games.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;===

Zidane first appears in the video game &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; as one of its protagonists. Prior to the events of the game, an orphaned Zidane leaves his adoptive father Baku to search for his real home, his only memory being a blue light. Unsuccessful in his search, he returns to Baku and rejoins his troupe of performers and criminals called Tantalus.

At the age of sixteen, he becomes involved in Baku&#x27;s scheme to kidnap Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII, fomented by Regent Cid Fabool VIII of Lindblum in order to distance the princess from her increasingly hawkish adoptive mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria. Zidane and his cohorts travel to the kingdom of Alexandria aboard the airship &quot;Prima Vista&quot;, ostensibly to perform a theatre play as a part of their plot to kidnap Princess Garnet.

While the rest of the crew is performing the play &quot;I Want to be Your Canary&quot; before Queen Brahne and her citizens, Zidane would use the cover to sneak in and attempt to kidnap the princess. He first encounters her when she tries to sneak out of the palace herself, and, at her request, promises to do his best to kidnap her. During the crew&#x27;s escape flying out of the castle in the &quot;Prima Vista&quot; with the princess, the Queen&#x27;s forces managed to damage the airship. From there, Zidane and his crew, along with Garnet, her stowaway bodyguard Adelbert Steiner, and a little black mage named Vivi all wind up crash-landing into a magical forest full of monsters. The group will commence their travel into a world-spanning adventure involving war, subterfuge, magical crystals, summoned monsters, and clones.

Zidane takes a liking to the princess and does not hesitate to flirt with her throughout the game, much to Steiner&#x27;s dismay. His dagger became the inspiration for Princess Garnet&#x27;s chosen alias for herself. Zidane would adapt to his role as party leader, his charisma and personality drawing many characters in the game: Eiko joins the party after becoming infatuated with him, and his rival Amarant joins the party out of curiosity following his defeat by Zidane.

Later in the game, it is discovered that the true reason for Zidane&#x27;s existence is revealed: he is a Genome, an artificially constructed cloned life form doll-like humanoid. He was originally created by the wizard Garland on the planet Terra to replace his failed creation, the villain Kuja, as a more powerful &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, whose purpose is to wipe out all life on the planet Gaia. As part of the Terran&#x27;s original plan to save their dying civilization, the young planet of Gaia was selected for on assimilation. The Terrans left their physical bodies and locked their souls in Pandemonium to be watched over by Garland until the Fusion&#x27;s completion. The Fusion was a disastrous failure, leaving Gaia&#x27;s surface in ruin and ending up with Terra shifting inside the planet of Gaia. Garland was tasked with removing the souls of Gaia&#x27;s &quot;cycle of souls&quot; and replacing them with Terra&#x27;s. The Genomes are empty, soulless vessels synthesized by Garland to eventually host the Terran souls, and he planted the Iifa Tree, a gigantic brain-like tree filtering the souls of Gaia.

Bitter and jealous of his successor, Kuja casts Zidane down to Gaia, where he is found and adopted by Baku. The revelation drives Zidane to despair and he briefly abandons the party, but later returns as the group managed to mollify him. After the party is rescued from the Iifa Tree by Kuja, Zidane choose to go back inside the collapsing structure to save Kuja. For nearly a year it is believed that he did not survive; however, he makes a dramatic reappearance on stage in Alexandria at the end of the game, reuniting with Garnet.

===Other appearances===
Zidane appears as the protagonist hero representing &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; in the &quot;Dissidia&quot; series of games: &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Dissidia 012&quot;, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;, and &quot;Dissidia Opera Omnia&quot;. He is also featured in the rhythm game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Curtain Call&quot; as the main character representing &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. His appearances in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off games include &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;, &quot;Brave Exvius&quot;, and &quot;All the Bravest&quot;. His appearances in crossover video games include &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot;, &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, and &quot;Puzzle and Dragons&quot;.

==Promotion and reception==
Zidane, along with three other protagonists of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Cloud Strife, Squall Leonheart, and Tidus were released as figurines as part of the first volume of the &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; Trading Arts series to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Zidane, along with Cloud, Squall, Tidus, and Lightning are part of a line of super-deformed mini figures released by &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; Trading Arts series. Zidane was released as a figurine in Square Enix&#x27;s Bring Arts line, sold as a pair along with Garnet.

Since his appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, Zidane has received a generally positive reception. He is regarded by &quot;Famitsu&quot; readers as one of the best video game characters, placing #17 in the &quot;Famitsu&quot; top 50 character ranking in 2010. In 2020 NHK conducted an All-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Grand Poll of Japanese players, featuring over 468,000 votes. The poll results revealed that Zidane was ranked the fifth greatest &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character by Japanese respondents, just after Vivi who was ranked fourth. Game journalists listed him as one of the greatest &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters based on multiple of his traits.

Some reviewers praised the character&#x27;s personality. &quot;IGN&quot; editor David Smith called him charming, and that he &quot;breaks the streak of reluctant &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; heroes, injecting a touch of redder blood back into the series&quot;. For Zidane&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; editor Ryan Clements described Zidane as a &quot;laid back, flirtatious character and one full of energy and enthusiasm&quot;, unlike his peers from other numbered entries. He adds that seeing his &quot;short blades spin in a dizzying frenzy is definitely a sight to behold&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; editor Andrew Vestal called Zidane&#x27;s &quot;instinctive womanizing&quot; as an amusing trait of his. Jeremy Parish from &quot;Polygon&quot; thought Zidane have &quot;a roguish, Han Solo-like quality to him, making him something of a small fry and an outsider in a big-picture narrative that involves kingdoms at war, almighty summoned monsters and ancient races&quot;, until the manifestation of conventional &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; tropes which reveal Zidane&#x27;s true cosmic origins. Lucas White from &quot;Playstation Lifestyle&quot; noted that &quot;his personality and motivations are drastically different from those of his peers, making him the driving force of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&#x27;s&quot; unique flavor&quot;, and that at his core is &quot;his ability to protect people he cares about; his essence is his virtue&quot;. Daniella Lucas from &quot;Gamesradar&quot; thought Zidane was &quot;cool with his dual daggers&quot;, and noted that &quot;Zidane&#x27;s tale of adventure and self discovery while dealing with the evil that Kuja inflicts upon the world of Gaia is as classic as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; gets&quot;. Michel S. Beaulieu, co-author of the book &quot;Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough&quot; suggested that Zidane is a revolutionary, fighting against the abusive power of the upper class, represented by Queen Brahne.

Nadia Oxford from &quot;USGamer&quot; commented that she had mixed feelings about how Zidane&#x27;s character is developed, in particular the Genomes and Terra reveal towards the end of the game, which she believes overlaps with Vivi&#x27;s character arc. Oxford believed that there could have been an interesting contrast between Zidane and Vivi if the entire sequence was handled with a better focus; Oxford compared him to other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; protagonists such as Terra Branford and Cloud, noting that it was typical of JRPG&#x27;s from the 1990s where many characters would suffer an existential crisis upon realizing that they are not who they actually think they are. Nevertheless, Oxford is satisfied by his overall character arc, noting that the surprise reveal of Zidane&#x27;s true nature does tie into the game&#x27;s narrative theme. Oxford concluded that Zidane is likeable and well-developed as a character, as he eventually accepts that he is not the sum of his parts and he could find his own purpose. &quot;GameCritics&quot; editor Erin Bell called Zidane the &quot;strangest looking &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; hero to date&quot;, citing his &quot;nondescript features and monkey tail&quot;. However, she did describe him as a hero that is easy for one to understand and sympathize with.

Zidane also received a less positive response from some reviewers. Beaulieu described Zidane and his altruistic motto of &quot;you don&#x27;t need a reason to help people&quot; as a &quot;hopeless case&quot; when judged against the Hobbesian model of moral philosophy. Chris Carter of &quot;Destructoid&quot; was of the view that Zidane as the protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; is not being discussed as much as his peers from other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, and expressed a personal preference for Vivi. &quot;Houston Press&quot; expressed disappointment with the story of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; as he felt Garnet was more interesting as a main character than Zidane, criticizing how besides having some unlikable traits, in the ending the character tries to save the main antagonist, Kuja. Scott Baird from &quot;Screen Rant&quot; echoed Oxford&#x27;s view that Zidane&#x27;s character arc overlaps with Vivi&#x27;s, commenting that the plot twist &quot;might not have been so bad if it wasn&#x27;t also being done in a far superior manner with Vivi&quot;, and criticized the developers&#x27; decision to add &quot;unnecessary layers of grimness&quot; to Zidane&#x27;s backstory which came out of nowhere and &quot;doesn&#x27;t really add anything to the story&quot;.

Zidane&#x27;s relationship with Garnet has invited some comment from various sources. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; believed that their relationship is poorly depicted, citing a lack of chemistry between the two characters and disapproved of their big-headed, childlike character design. Mia Consalvo, author of &quot;Hot Dates and Fairy-Tale Romances&quot; published in the book &quot;The Video Game Theory Reader&quot;, described his appearance as feminized, referencing his small stature, long hair, clothing with laces, and lack of obvious muscles. She questioned whether heterosexual players may identify less with a character like this, and whether homosexual players may. She added that his relationship with female protagonist Garnet saves him from being considered &quot;abnormal&quot;, and that the ultimate goal is for the players to relate to Zidane as best as possible. She added that no matter how the players proceed, Zidane always ends up forming a relationship with Garnet, and players are encouraged to insert themselves into the character as their avatar. Because of this, she questions how female and homosexual players would feel about their relationship, which she states would destroy the immersion. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Leah B. Jackson was more positive towards the relationship, finding the early premise that Garnet wanted to be kidnapped by Zidane intriguing. Jason Schreier from &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised the game&#x27;s final scene, in which Zidane returns to Garnet, as being particularly memorable.

<text>George Town is a town located on the island of Great Exuma in the Exuma district of the Bahamas. It had a population of 2,488 based on 2012 estimates.

The Government Building is a popular tourist attraction inspired by the architecture of the Government House in Nassau. The deep water of Elizabeth Harbour is a popular spot for sea-faring travelers. Pirates used the harbor in the 17th century and plantation owners from Virginia settled the town in the 18th century. During World War II the US Navy used the port.

Services in George Town include shops, restaurants, liquor stores, a gas station, insurance companies, churches, schools, a police station, a hospital and various other small businesses, along with a BTC and Aliv telecommunications office and the &quot;iconic&quot; Peace &amp; Plenty Hotel and a small library. In 2015 the town&#x27;s historic straw market caught fire and burned down due to an electrical fault and no fire trucks were available to combat the blaze.

Lake Victoria lies in the center of George Town, on the edges of which are a boat rental company, boat ramp, and a dock adjacent to one of the grocery stores in town. Water access to Lake Victoria from Exuma Harbour is under a small bridge in the downtown area.

George Town relies heavily on tourism as a source of income for its businesses and residents, and hosts an annual &quot;Winter Residents&#x27; Reception&quot; to welcome seasonal residents and boaters.

George Town hosts the Bahamas&#x27; National Family Island Regatta each year, but for the first time in 67 years it was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns. The annual Run for Pompey marathon is also a major tourist attraction held annually starting and ending in George Town but due to COVID-19 was held as a virtual race.

<text>Nathia Gali or Nathiagali () is a hill station and mountain resort town located in the Abbottabad District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is located at the centre of the Galyat range, where several hill stations are situated. Nathia Gali is known for its scenery, hiking trails and weather, which is much cooler than the rest of the Galyat range due to it being at a higher altitude. It is situated approximately away from both Murree and Abbottabad.

==History==
During British rule, Nathia Gali, then part of Abbottabad tehsil of Hazara District, served as the summer headquarters of the Chief Commissioner of the (then) Peshawar division of the Punjab. The town, along with Dunga Gali constituted a notified area under the Punjab Municipalities Act, 1891. The income in 1903-04 was Rs. 3,000, chiefly derived from a house tax, while expenditure was Rs. 1,900.

==Climate==
The weather of Nathia Gali remains cool, pleasant and foggy in summers (1 May to 31 August). During the monsoon season (1 July to 16 September), rain is expected almost every day. Cool winds start to lower temperatures in autumn. Winters (1 November to 28 February) are cold and chilly. In December and January, heavy snowfall may occur. The weather remains cool throughout the spring. In Nathia Gali, the most comfortable weather is during the summer season. Frequent rainfall occurs here annually. Annual rainfall ranges between and . In the winter, temperatures can drop to below , and in summer it rise to highs over .

==Transportation==
The town is connected to Abbottabad and Murree by the Nathia Gali road. Public transport runs daily from Abbottabad and Rawalpindi to Nathia Gali.

Between December and January, heavy snowfall is possible in the area and the road leading to Nathia Gali may occasionally be blocked by heavy snow.

==Tourism==

Nathia Gali also serves as the administrative centre of the Nathia Gali Union Council. It is located in the Abbottabad District, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At an elevation of , it is a popular tourist resort in the summer months. It is forested with pine, cedar, oak, walnut and also other broad-leaved trees.

During the summer, Nathia Gali is relatively popular amongst tourists, but due to its limited area and availability of property, it is not thronged by as many people as the hill-station Murree, which is only an hour away, even though it has more recreation. Nathiagali is known for its trek that leads to Thandiani that passes through Dagri Naka.

Ayubia National Park is also one of the spots here that tourists and nature lovers often visit.

The Nathia Gali Bazaar has a variety of local handicrafts and products available. From traditional shawls, scarves, and embroidered fabrics to intricate woodwork and handmade jewelry, this bazaar is a treasure trove for souvenir hunters.

== Scenery ==

The natural scenery is highly attractive. Nathia Gali is famous for its lush, green meadows and deep forests of oak, cedar and pine. In winter, snowfall adds to the scene.
Nathia Gali has a church, St. Matthew&#x27;s, a remnant from the British period and made entirely of wood. It is situated at the edge of the mountain with a nice panorama towards Kashmir.
Nathia Gali has a small bazaar. Mukshpuri and Miranjani are two nearby high peaks. On a clear day, Nanga Parbat can be seen in the distance.

==Wildlife==

Nathia Gali is home to various species of birds, insects, butterflies and other animals such as rhesus monkeys. The World Wildlife Fund has an office in the Galyat and has assisted in the breeding and reintroduction of the species of the near-extinct common hill leopard in the forests of the Ayubia National Park, right by Dunga Gali and Nathia Gali. This area was thought to be a perfect habitat for them but according to local reports they frequently came out of the forest after cattle of the local villagers and were occasionally shot. Packs of pi-dogs, which were previously considered to be a nighttime menace, can no longer be seen anywhere in the Galyat; it is thought that most have been killed by leopards. 

In the summer of 2006, several women were found dead in the deep valleys of Galyat with wounds from attacks. A large leopard was caught and eventually shot. His body has been stuffed and kept in the Dunga Gali Wildlife Museum, where he has been named the &#x27;Ghost of Galyat&#x27;. However, despite their reputation, these leopards are rarely spotted.

==Subdivisions==

The Union Council of Nathia Gali is divided into the following areas: Bagan, Donga Gali, Jhansa, Keri Sarafali, Keri Raiki, Lassan, Malach, Nathiagali Pasala, and Badhair. Badhair is the central part of the Nathiagali Union Council.

== Ethnic groups ==
The main tribe of Nathia Gali are the Karlal, and a minority of Dhunds (who now call themselves &#x27;Dhund-Abbasis&#x27;). The locals are a kin to the people of other parts of Galyat and speak Hindko. Until well into the 1960s, most of these tribes and clans were mostly living rather basic and primitive lives, due to lack of educational and employment opportunities. Most of them had to seek jobs and education down in the plains and cities such as Rawalpindi, Lahore, Peshawar and even as far away as Karachi. However, in more recent times, with economic development, many of them are either employed locally in the tourism industry or in various jobs and businesses in the Abbottabad area. It is monitored by GDA.

<doc id="994414" wikidata="Q4664040" url="?curid=994414" title="Abbey Mills Pumping Station">
<text>Abbey Mills Pumping Station is a sewage pumping station in Mill Meads, East London, operated by Thames Water. The pumping station lifts sewage from the London sewerage system into the Northern Outfall Sewer and the Lee Tunnel, which both run to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.

The original pumping station, designed by engineer Joseph Bazalgette, Edmund Cooper, and architect Charles Driver, was built between 1865 and 1868, housing eight beam engines by Rothwell &amp; Co. of Bolton. Two engines on each arm of a cruciform plan, with an elaborate Byzantine style, described as &quot;The Cathedral of Sewage&quot;. Another of Bazalgette&#x27;s designs, Crossness Pumping Station, is located south of the River Thames at Crossness, at the end of the Southern Outfall Sewer.

A modern sewage pumping station (Station F) was completed in 1997 about south of the original station.

==History==
The pumping station was built at the site of an earlier watermill owned by the former Stratford Langthorne Abbey, from which it gained the name &quot;Abbey Mills&quot;. It was first recorded as &quot;Wiggemulne&quot; in 1312, i.e., &quot;the mill of a man called Wicga&quot;, an Old English personal name, and subsequently became associated with the abbey. The abbey lay between the Channelsea River and Marsh Lane (Manor Road). It was dissolved in 1538. By 1840, the North Woolwich Railway ran through the site, and it began to be used to establish factories, and ultimately the sewage pumping stations.

===Purpose===
Abbey Mills Pumping Station was constructed to lift sewage between the two Low Level Sewers and the Northern Outfall Sewer, which was built in the 1860s to carry the increasing amount of sewage produced in London away from the centre of the city to the sewage treatment plant at Beckton.

Details of the pumps in the year 1912/13 were as follows:

The pumping capability was increased with the addition of gas engine driven pumps. Details of the operation of the pumps in the year 1919/20 were as follows:

Two Moorish styled chimneys – unused since steam power had been replaced by electric motors in 1933 – were demolished in 1941, as it was feared that a strike from German bombs might topple them onto the pumping station.

The building still houses electric pumps – to be used to assist the new facility next door when required.

The main building is Grade II* listed and there are many Grade II-listed ancillary buildings, including the stumps of the demolished chimneys.

==Modern pumping station==

The modern pumping station (Station F) was designed by architects Allies and Morrison. The original building (Station A) has electrical pumps and these are used to assist the modern pumping station during high flows if required.
It is one of the three principal London pumping stations dealing with foul water.
Both pumping stations are able to discharge flows directly into the Lee Tunnel.

==Lee Tunnel==
The Lee Tunnel is a sewage tunnel that runs from Abbey Mills to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works and is designed to handle the 16 million tons of overflow sewage that was previously discharged into the River Lea each year at Abbey Mills, as well as the additional wastewater brought to Abbey Mills by the Thames Tideway tunnel. Construction of the Lee Tunnel began in 2012 and it was opened for service in early 2016.

==Thames Tideway Scheme==
Abbey Mills is the endpoint of the main Thames Tideway tunnel, where sewage will be transferred into the Lee Tunnel and onwards to Beckton for treatment. Both the Lee Tunnel and the main Thames Tideway tunnel also serve as storage reservoirs to store wastewater during heavy rainfall.

<doc id="994415" wikidata="Q300442" url="?curid=994415" title="A Hole in My Heart">
<text>A Hole in My Heart () is a 2004 Swedish experimental drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson, starring Thorsten Flinck, Sanna Bråding, Björn Almroth and Goran Marjanovic. The story revolves around a man who makes a pornographic film in his apartment with a male friend and a woman, while his teenage son stays in his room and listens to ambient noise music.

The film is notable for its explicit imagery, including close-ups of vaginal reconstruction surgery, an uncomfortable anal sex scene, a masturbation scene with a toothbrush, and an extended scene about the woman&#x27;s vagina. Moodysson leaves the interpretation of the film to the viewer: &quot;I have cooked you a delicious meal, but I&#x27;m not going to chew it for you.&quot;

==Plot==

In an apartment somewhere in Sweden, a woman, a man and his friend are recording an amateur porn movie, while the one man&#x27;s teenage son is trying to stay out of their way in his room. As time progresses, their filming gets out of hand. All the while, the father is concerned that his son has no respect for him, and the son is concerned about how his father treats the woman.

==Cast==
* Thorsten Flinck as Rickard
* Sanna Bråding as Tess
* Björn Almroth as Erik
* Goran Marjanovic as Geko

==Production==
Moodysson&#x27;s original intent was to have the film taking place in the United States, using an American cast. Research was made about the American porn industry, but eventually Moodysson decided to set the story in Sweden: &quot;I was, like, hit by a truck — and that truck was &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot;. When I tried to return to that American version, some kind of story that takes place in the American porn industry, I discovered I couldn’t do it. I had to transform it into this much smaller and more claustrophobic Swedish story.&quot;

Filming took place during 4 weeks in Trollhättan. The film was shot digitally with DVCams. After the first day of filming, Thorsten Flinck went to a hospital and lied to a doctor about having an aching back, which prompted the doctor to give him three morphine pills. When Flinck woke up the next morning he started the day by swallowing all three pills. He was nearly fired when he arrived at the set on drugs, but was given a second chance. The rest of the production was free from incidents.

==Release==
The film premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in Sweden on 17 September 2004. The theatrical poster featured a warning sign about strong images. Lukas Moodysson has expressed disapproval over the future VHS and DVD releases of the film (the decision to release it was out of his hands) — he would have preferred a theatres-only release, to avoid children being exposed to it.

===Critical response===
The Swedish reception was split. With a few reservations, Malena Janson at &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; rated the film 5 out of 6 and praised Moodysson for his daring approach: &quot;&quot;A Hole in My Heart&quot; consolidates Moodysson&#x27;s role as the fearless innovator, border stretcher and truth teller in European cinema - who fully masters, and isn&#x27;t reluctant to use, the film medium&#x27;s artistic and political possibilities. To the delight of those who dare to watch.&quot; Jens Peterson at &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; respected the film for being uncompromising, but couldn&#x27;t give it a higher rating than 2 out of 5: &quot;Several times, the narrative style stands in the way of the story. &quot;A Hole in My Heart&quot; is both more overly obvious and stranger than Moodysson&#x27;s three earlier, better, films. Occasionally even tedious, a word you never could have used about Moodysson.&quot;

The film was poorly received by English-language critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 44% based on reviews from 18 critics.

Chicago was formed in early 1967, first as the Big Thing, then Chicago Transit Authority when producer James William Guercio took them on in 1968. Their trademark was fusing brass and jazz with a soulful rock and roll feel that Guercio thought would prove successful, lobbying for his label to sign the band.

Chicago Transit Authority signed to Columbia Records late in 1968 and recorded their first album in late January 1969 at CBS studios on 52nd Street in New York City. While Guercio had recently produced Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears&#x27; second album (which proved to be a huge smash), he did so to raise capital for his band, and to secure the contract with Columbia (which was reluctant at first to have two jazz-rock bands since Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears was already on their roster). By the end of the &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; sessions, the band had decided they wanted it to be a double album. Skeptical, as the band had no track record, Columbia agreed to the concept only if the group would take a royalty cut.

In addition to the material recorded for the album, &quot;Wake Up Sunshine&quot;, &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; (both later released on their second album), &quot;Loneliness is Just a Word&quot; (later released on &quot;Chicago III&quot;), and an early version of &quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot; (with mostly different music than its eventual versions on &quot;Live in Japan&quot; and &quot;Chicago XI&quot;) all date from this era, and were performed as early as 1968. Other early original songs, such as &quot;Dedicated to Girl Number 1&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Life&quot;, were never released.

Released in April 1969, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; (sometimes informally referred to simply as &quot;CTA&quot;) was not an immediate hit, eventually reaching No. 17 in the US and No. 9 in the UK. While critical reaction was generally favorable, sales were slow at first and the album initially failed to produce any hit singles, with the group seen as an album-oriented collective. Meanwhile, FM radio, with its album-oriented format, helped push sales along. In 1970 and 1971, &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot; (No. 7), &quot;Beginnings&quot; (No. 7) and &quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot; (No. 71 and No. 24 for the 1971 re-release) all made it into the Billboard Hot 100 belatedly. Buoyed by the success of their later albums, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; had stayed on the charts for 171 weeks as of June 1975, setting the then record for a rock album&#x27;s chart longevity by October 1974 at 155 weeks, and was certified gold (and later platinum and double platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

While the band toured the album, legal action was threatened by the actual Chicago Transit Authority, forcing the group to truncate their name to simply &quot;Chicago&quot;.

==Musical style, writing, composition==
Keyboardist Robert Lamm, guitarist Terry Kath and bassist Peter Cetera shared lead vocals, while James Pankow, Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider handled all brass and woodwinds (trombone, trumpet and saxophone, clarinet and flute respectively) and Danny Seraphine played drums. Band members added percussion during sections of a song when they weren&#x27;t playing their main instrument. For example, on &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, Pankow was on cowbell, Parazaider on tambourine, and Loughnane on claves. Lamm, Kath and Pankow were the band&#x27;s main composers at this time. According to the band&#x27;s producer, James William Guercio, Jimi Hendrix was an avowed fan of Kath&#x27;s playing. According to the album&#x27;s original liner notes, the solo performance of Kath on &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; was created without the use of any pedals. In a nod to Hendrix&#x27;s guitar expressionism (Hendrix most notably used wah and fuzz pedals), Kath instead plugged directly into his studio amplifier and improvised the entire track in one take for the purpose of pure tone.

The album is one of two not to have any songwriting contributions from Cetera during his tenure in the band, the other being &quot;Chicago V&quot;. He started writing songs with the second album, &quot;Chicago&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
Because of dealings between the recording company and the group&#x27;s producer, James William Guercio, the group&#x27;s studio time was limited to only five days of basic tracking and five days of overdubbing by the recording company. According to Guercio, the album was &quot;done 8-track.&quot;

According to band member Walter Parazaider, when the group went into the studio to record the album, they &quot; &#x27;found out we knew very little about what we were doing. ... The first song was “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?” We tried to record it as a band, live, all of us in the studio at once.&#x27; &quot; Finally it was decided that drums, bass, keyboard, and guitars would be recorded first, and then the horns and vocals.

== Artwork ==
The cover design for the album is called &quot;Painted Shingle&quot; on the group&#x27;s official web site. The inside jacket features individual photos of each band member, which reviewer Peter Morelli notes, &quot;For a band deliberately constructed to be a leaderless democracy, Robert Lamm (far right, standing) sure stands out in the band photos!&quot;

== Reissues ==

In 1974, the album was also mixed in quadraphonic sound and released on SQ encoded LP (GQ-33255) and Dolby Quadraphonic 8-Track (QCA-33255).

In 2002, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records and Columbia Records. Rhino Records trimmed some of the songs, noticeably the fadeouts on &quot;Questions #67 and #68&quot; (six seconds longer on the LP) and &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; (five seconds longer), the 10 second gap between &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Liberation&quot;, and some studio chatter.

In 2010, Rhino Handmade re-released the original quadraphonic mix of the album on a limited edition DTS DVD, and in 2016, in DTS-HD Master Audio, as part of Chicago Quadio Box Set.

On June 26, 2019, Rhino Records announced a 50th Anniversary Remix edition of &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, offering it in both CD and double LP formats. Although the press release announced an August 30, 2019 release date, the date was pushed back to September 13, 2019 outside of Canada. The band worked with engineer Tim Jessup, who also mixed the band’s &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival.&quot; Robbie Gerson, reviewing the vinyl release for &quot;Audiophile Audition&quot;, gave an overall positive review, saying, &quot;Rhino has done an outstanding job in re-mastering &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; to 180-gram vinyl.&quot; In his review for &quot;All About Jazz&quot;, Doug Colette gave the CD four out of five stars, noting that there&#x27;s &quot;less precedence for the harmony singing,&quot; but that there&#x27;s &quot;wallop to the drums,&quot; &quot;edge to the guitar,&quot; and &quot;great care throughout to highlight, without overstatement but with proportionate accuracy and impact, the tightly-fused rhythm work of drummer Danny Seraphine and bassist Peter Cetera: both sound equally vigorous and muscular in their playing.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==

In 1969, the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

In 2014, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="994429" wikidata="Q1319988" url="?curid=994429" title="Chesapeake Bay Bridge">
<text>The Gov. William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge (informally called the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and, locally, the Bay Bridge) is a major dual-span bridge in the U.S. state of Maryland. Spanning the Chesapeake Bay, it connects the state&#x27;s rural Eastern Shore region with its urban and suburban Western Shore, running between Stevensville and Sandy Point State Park near the capital city of Annapolis. The original span, opened in 1952 and with a length of , was the world&#x27;s longest continuous over-water steel structure. The parallel span was added in 1973. The bridge is named for William Preston Lane Jr., who as the 52nd Governor of Maryland launched its construction in the late 1940s after decades of political indecision and public controversy.

The bridge is part of U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301, and serves as a vital link in both routes. As part of cross-country US 50, it connects the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area with Ocean City, Maryland, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and other coastal tourist destinations. As part of US 301, it serves as part of an alternative route for Interstate 95 travelers, between northern Delaware and the Washington, D.C., area. The bridge is busy and often congested with traffic, particularly during peak hours and summer months.

The bridge&#x27;s role in transportation was filled by ferries before the first span&#x27;s construction. The bridge has fostered the state&#x27;s economic growth, particularly of Queen Anne&#x27;s County and Ocean City. Further expansion of the bridge has been discussed since 2004, with a task force being formed to investigate the possibility of building a third span.

==History==
===Proposals and ferries===
It is possible that studies may have been conducted as early as the 1880s into the possibility of a bridge across the Chesapeake Bay. However, the first known proposal came about in 1907 and called for a crossing between Baltimore and Tolchester Beach. In 1927, local businesspeople were authorized to finance the construction of a Baltimore to Tolchester Beach crossing. Plans for the new bridge were made, but construction was canceled following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 with the collapse of the American economy and resulting Great Depression of the 1930s.

Ferries were used as the main mode of transportation across the bay from the colonial period until the completion of the 1952 bridge. The first service ran from Annapolis to Broad Creek on Kent Island, roughly where the bridge is today. In 1919, the Claiborne–Annapolis Ferry Company began running ferries between Annapolis and Claiborne, a community near St. Michaels.

In July 1930, the Claiborne–Annapolis Ferry Company added a new route, one running from Annapolis to Matapeake, a significantly shorter distance. The auto and passenger ferries were taken over by the State Roads Commission in 1941 (reorganized into today&#x27;s State Highway Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation in 1973). Two years later, the commission moved the western terminus of the old Annapolis–Matapeake ferry to Sandy Point (later adjacent to Sandy Point State Park), shortening the cross-bay trip.

===Construction of 1952 span===

A 1938 proposal by the Maryland General Assembly was the first to call for a bridge at the Sandy Point–Kent Island location. Although the legislation authorizing the new bridge passed, the involvement of the United States in World War II delayed the bridge&#x27;s construction. In 1947, with the war over, the Assembly, under the leadership of Maryland Governor William Preston Lane Jr., (1892–1967), passed legislation directing the old State Roads Commission to begin construction. Ground was broken in January 1949, and after a -year construction project, the bridge opened to traffic on July 30, 1952, as both the longest continuous over-water steel structure, and the third longest bridge in the world. Before the opening, a parade of vehicles made the first official crossing, led by then current Governor Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, (1900–1974), and other state officials in a distinctive white Cadillac convertible flying huge American and Maryland flags. On November 9, 1967, the bridge was dedicated to Governor Lane, who had died earlier that year, and officially renamed the &quot;William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge&quot;.
===1973 expansion and later construction===
In 1967, due to increasing traffic volume, the Maryland General Assembly authorized three possible new crossings, all suggested during the 1964 Chesapeake Bay crossing study. These included one further north near Baltimore, one in southern Maryland, and an additional span to be added to the existing bridge from Kent Island to Sandy Point; ultimately, the third option was chosen. Construction of the new parallel span began in 1969 to the north of the original bridge, and it was completed on June 28, 1973.
From 1986 to 1988, the eastbound Chesapeake Bay Bridge had its deck replaced. This resulted in all traffic temporarily using the westbound span.

From 2006 to 2010, the westbound Chesapeake Bay Bridge had its deck replaced.

===Notable incidents===

Because of its height, the narrowness of the spans (there are no hard shoulders), the low guardrails, and the frequency of high winds, it is often cited as one of the scariest bridges in the United States. Several weather-related incidents have caused complete closures of the bridge.

The bridge has been closed four times due to extreme weather. The first time was September 18, 2003, during Hurricane Isabel and its high winds. On August 27, 2011, the bridge was closed to all traffic due to the impact of Hurricane Irene. Then-Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley ordered the bridge closed when sustained winds exceeded . On October 29, 2012, the bridge was closed due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy. On March 6, 2013, during the March 2013 nor&#x27;easter, high winds again caused the bridge to be closed.

On August 10, 2008, a tractor trailer involved in a head-on collision near the west end fell from the bridge; the driver died in the crash. The incident highlighted concern that the bridge may not be structurally safe, but the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) discounted any structural or engineering problems with it. Inspections of the wall in the weeks following the accident revealed that there was deterioration in the form of corrosion of the steel reinforcements inside barriers; this prompted immediate repairs to the wall.

On June 24, 2024, traffic on both spans was suspended for nearly 30 minutes in late morning as the cargo ship MV &quot;Dali&quot; passed under, escorted by tugboats, on its journey from the Port of Baltimore to Virginia International Gateway in Norfolk, VA. The &quot;Dali&quot; had collided with Baltimore&#x27;s Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, leading to that bridge&#x27;s collapse.

==Specifications and operations==

With shore-to-shore lengths of , the two spans of the bridge form the longest fixed water crossing in Maryland. The bridge&#x27;s western terminus is in Sandy Point State Park, located northeast of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and its eastern terminus is in Stevensville on Kent Island in Queen Anne&#x27;s County. The two spans are relatively similar in height, with the older span at and the newer span at .

===Structural details===
With the exception of the number of lanes on each (two on the original span and three on the newer span) and differences owing to the design standards for the periods in which they were built, the spans are structurally similar. Both were designed by J. E. Greiner Company, which later became a part of AECOM through the company&#x27;s acquisition of URS Corporation. Each span features:
*Two main spans over the bay&#x27;s two shipping channels:
**A long suspension section over the western channel with a maximum clearance of at the main span—high enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels and tall ships
**A through-truss cantilever span over the eastern channel
*Deck truss and steel girder spans flanking the main spans
*Concrete beam spans on the portions closest to the shores
*A curve near the western terminus, which is required so that the main spans cross the bay&#x27;s shipping channels at 90 degrees per United States Army Corps of Engineers requirements

===Traffic control===

Traffic patterns on the bridge&#x27;s five lanes can be adjusted via its lane control system, which consists of overhead lane control signals on both spans and approaches. Typically, the two lanes on the south-most span are configured for vehicles traveling east on eastbound US 50/US 301, while the three lanes on the north-most span are configured for vehicles traveling west on westbound US 50/US 301; the spans are therefore referred to as the &quot;eastbound span&quot; and &quot;westbound span&quot;, respectively. However, this pattern is adjusted during incidents or peak travel times: for instance, on the outset of weekends when there is a high volume of beach-bound traffic, one lane on the westbound span is configured for eastbound traffic.

In 2006, pink markers were placed along the eastbound span to mark out the suggested following distance, similar to systems used in Minnesota and Pennsylvania. The markers are a part of the MDTA&#x27;s &quot;Pace Your Space&quot; campaign to prevent vehicle collisions and traffic congestion due to tailgating on the bridge.

In April 2013, changes were made to increase safety on the westbound span during two-way operations: signs, pavement markings, and rumble strips were modified, and a buffer zone between the left and center lanes was created. As a result, motorists can no longer switch between the left and center lanes, whether or not two-way operations are in effect. Two-way traffic may occur on the eastbound span during overnight roadwork or during emergency situations that close the westbound span, on which two-way traffic is more common. When the MDTA closes either span for overnight roadwork, it implements two-way traffic on the span that remains open. During eastbound span closure, two-way traffic operates on the westbound span with the center lane closed.

In January 2020, Governor Larry Hogan announced that the tollbooths on the eastbound side of bridge were being removed in preparation for all-electronic tolling on the Kent Island side of the eastbound bridge. The merged lanes tie directly into the two lanes on the eastbound bridge. The MDTA is replacing lane control signals on both bridges with those that have flashing strobe lights to indicate a lane closure or a lane with contraflow traffic, and is installing an automated gate system on the bridge to allow quicker implementation of two-way traffic on the bridge. The automated gate system will reduce traffic congestion when implementing two-way traffic. Illuminated pavement markings will be installed to show where the crossovers are during two-way traffic operations. MDTA crews will no longer have to manually open and close the crossovers for two-way traffic operations.

The MDTA has used traffic cones and barrels to open and close crossovers, and to create tapers for the reversible lane. When two-way traffic is implemented, the MDTA momentarily stops traffic to reposition traffic cones and barrels to taper traffic into the reversible lane. MDTA Police then escort traffic across the bridge in the reversible lane. The MDTA will not implement two-way traffic in certain weather conditions, including excess precipitation and high winds. The MDTA may stop all traffic when the wind speed exceeds 55 mph. Two-way traffic on the bridge requires all associated signage and systems to be operational. The MDTA has to monitor two-way traffic operations on the bridge due to the length of the bridge and its lack of shoulders. The MDTA will stop two-way traffic if westbound delays pile up, at which point westbound traffic will be prioritized. Any time contraflow traffic is implemented on either of the bridges, the speed limit for the contraflow lane is reduced to 40 mph while the other lanes remain at 50 mph. MDTA Police will momentarily stop traffic for MDTA crews to reposition traffic cones and barrels to close off the left lane leading up to the bridge in the event of inclement weather during contraflow traffic.

===Tolls and fees===

Operated by the MDTA, the bridge has a one-way toll (eastbound) of $4.00 for two-axle vehicles; vehicles with a Maryland E-ZPass pay $2.50. Previously the bridge had a one-way (eastbound) toll of $6.00 for two-axle vehicles (raised from $4 on July 1, 2013); vehicles with E-ZPass that were enrolled in the Bay Bridge Commuter Plan paid $2.10 (raised from $1 on July 1, 2013).

Tolls were collected in both directions until April 1989, when tolls were doubled and only collected in the Eastbound direction.

In 2005, E-ZPass lanes were added at the Chesapeake Bay Toll Plaza.

All-electronic tolling began on May 12, 2020, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition.

The MDTA previously provided transportation across the bridge for nervous drivers, but that role is now filled by private companies.

==Bay Bridge Walk and Run==
While there are no pedestrian facilities on the bridge, the Bay Bridge Walk and Governor&#x27;s Bay Bridge Run used to afford an opportunity to cross the bridge on foot, usually on the first Sunday in May. The events took place on the eastbound span, which was closed to vehicles while two-way traffic shared the westbound span. Participants started on the east end of the bridge (on Kent Island) and proceeded west to the finish near the toll plaza. WMATA and MTA transit buses transported participants between outlying parking areas and the start and finish points.

The run, a 10K race across the bridge, is held early in the morning before the walk. It is conducted by the Annapolis Striders, a local running organization, and controlled by the MDTA and Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Proceeds went to the Chesapeake Bay Trust in support of the bay.

The first walk was held in 1975, when a Towson Boy Scout leader asked Governor Marvin Mandel if his troop could walk across the bridge during maintenance. The annual walk was canceled for the first time in 1980 due to poor weather conditions, and later saw frequent cancellations throughout the 2000s. During this period the walk was canceled in:
*2002 and 2007 due to poor weather conditions.
*2003 and 2005 due to security concerns.
*2008, 2009, and 2010 due to construction activity in the area on the west side of the bridge where participants would otherwise be staged. Fiscal concerns were also cited as a contributing factor to the 2010 cancellation.
*2011 due to fiscal concerns.
*2012 for undisclosed reasons.

Following its cancellation in 2005, the MDTA considered decreasing the annual frequency of the event, citing traffic, fiscal, manpower, and security concerns. The most recent event (held in 2006) cost over $350,000, and the cost estimate for 2012 was almost $400,000. In late 2011, a non-profit group, the Greater Washington Sports Alliance (GWSA), approached the MDTA Capital Committee to propose sponsoring the event, along with a concert at Sandy Point State Park, at no cost to the MDTA. While the Capital Committee unanimously recommended that the MDTA Board approve the proposal contingent upon an agreement between the GWSA and the MDTA, the 2012 event was ultimately cancelled.

After increasingly consistent cancellations of the walking event, the MDTA, along with Queen Anne&#x27;s County, contracted with an outside company to have a professional 10K race across the bridge, which has been labeled the &quot;Across the Bay 10K&quot;. The inaugural event occurred November 9, 2014. The Race Director is Dave McGillivray, who has served in that capacity for the BAA Boston Marathon since 1988. The Across the Bay 10K has several charity beneficiaries, including bay research, bay restoration, and breast cancer research. The IRONMAN Foundation took over the race&#x27;s organization in 2016. In 2019, the race was held virtually due to maintenance on the bridge.

==Impact==

Since its construction, the bridge has made significant impacts on both sides of the bay; among them has been the growth of Eastern Shore communities. When the bridge opened in 1952, and again when the second span was added in 1973, the Eastern Shore was given easier access to Baltimore and Washington, causing areas in southern Queen Anne&#x27;s County to develop as bedroom communities. This extension of the Baltimore–Washington suburbs has led Queen Anne&#x27;s County to be listed as part of the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area. The bridge has also given easier access to Ocean City from the Western Shore, which has caused Ocean City to grow from a small town to one that is said to become the second largest city in Maryland during the summer.

In 1948, the impending completion of the bridge gave rise to an extension of US 50 to Ocean City. The route was extended along the corridor of Maryland Route 404 (MD 404) and a large portion of US 213, cutting both of those routes back. During the 1950s, US 50 on the Western Shore was rerouted onto the long-proposed Annapolis–Washington Expressway (now known as the John Hanson Highway), which was built at the time in order to provide better access to the bridge. As the Eastern Shore, particularly Ocean City, grew, further upgrades and realignments of US 50 took place. This work included the aforementioned 1973 completion of the second Bay Bridge span, the extension of the US 50 freeway eastward to the US 50/US 301 split in Queenstown, and the construction of a freeway bypass around the north side of Salisbury in 2002. Additionally, the road has been upgraded and realigned over the years from its original two-lane configuration to a four-lane divided highway, with the last such section being in Vienna, bypassed in 1991. Previous plans to expand US 50&#x27;s freeway portion and replace the aging Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge into Ocean City have been delayed.

The bridge is often the site of suicides by jumpers. As of 1995, more than 75 people had committed suicide during the bridge&#x27;s 43-year existence.

==Future expansion==

In December 2004, a study concluded that traffic across the bridge was expected to increase by 40% by 2025. The following year, a task force formed by Governor Bob Ehrlich met to again explore the possibility of establishing a new Chesapeake Bay crossing. The task force concluded that a bridge would be the best option for an additional crossing, and four geographic locations for such a bridge were explored: Anne Arundel County to Queen Anne&#x27;s County (the existing location), Baltimore County to Kent County, Anne Arundel or Calvert County to Talbot County, and Calvert County to Dorchester County. In late 2006, the task force released a report on the study but did not make a final recommendation; members of the task force requested additional time to continue the study.

In 2020, it was announced that 11 of 14 potential sites for a third span had been rejected by the Maryland Transportation Authority following a $5 million study into the impacts of an additional span. Significant environmental and economic impacts were identified, with a report stating that any additional crossing is &quot;expected to be multiple billions of dollars.&quot;

<doc id="994437" wikidata="Q163855" url="?curid=994437" title="Lake Torrens">
<text>Lake Torrens (Kuyani: Ngarndamukia) is a large ephemeral, normally endorheic salt lake in central South Australia. After sufficiently extreme rainfall events, the lake flows out through the Pirie-Torrens corridor to the Spencer Gulf.

Islands on the lake include Andamooka Island and Murdie Island, both near the western shore; Trimmer Inlet runs between Andamooka Island and the shore, and Carrapateena Arm is an arm extending westwards south of Murdie Island.

==Description==
Lake Torrens lies between the Arcoona Plateau to the west and the Flinders Ranges to the east, about north of Port Augusta and about north of the Adelaide city centre. The lake is approximately above sea level, with a maximum depth of 1 m. It is located within the boundaries of Lake Torrens National Park.

Lake Torrens stretches approximately in length and in average width. It is Australia&#x27;s second largest lake when filled with water and encompasses an area of .

Usually the Lake Torrens catchment is an endorheic basin, having no outflow of water to the ocean.

Andamooka Island is the largest of several islands, lying along the western shore. It is a pastoral property, but an important area for birds such as the red-capped plover and cinnamon quail-thrush, and other islands host banded stilts and others. Murdie Island lies just south of Andamooka, its name of either Barngarla or Kuyani origin and identified in the 1850s. Its name, along with Carrapateena, reflect &quot;the earliest known and identifiable cultural associations to Lake Torrens&quot;, according to a 2016 court judgement. Other geographic features include Carrapateena Inlet (also called Carrapateena Arm) and Trimmer Inlet.

==History==
Approximately 35,000 years ago, the lake water was fresh to brackish, but has become increasingly saline since.

In a 2016 case in the Supreme Court of South Australia, the lake was noted as an sacred site and ownership was contested by three claimant groups: the Kokatha, Adnyamathanha/Kuyani and Barngarla peoples. The court ruled that none of the groups would be awarded native title to the area, as although all three groups had &#x27;significant and credible spiritual connection to parts of Lake Torrens&#x27; it was not possible to &#x27;prioritise one set of spiritual beliefs over the other&#x27;. In 2020, mine exploration licences covered part of the lake with prospecting for minerals underway The first European to see the lake was Edward Eyre in 1839, who spotted the salt bed from Mount Arden at the head of the Spencer Gulf.

Eyre named the lake after Colonel Robert Torrens who was one of the founders of the colony of South Australia. However the Kuyani people had long called the lake Ngarndamukia, meaning &quot;shower of rain&quot;.

The lake filled in 1897 and again in April 1989. The 1989 filling resulted in the lake outflowing through the Pirie-Torrens corridor to the Spencer Gulf, suggesting it likely did so in 1897 as well. It has a thin salt crust with red-brown clays beneath, which are soft and boggy. The area around the lake is sparsely vegetated with samphire, saltbush and bluebush.

In April 2013, the full extent of Lake Torrens was gazetted by the Government of South Australia as a locality with the name Lake Torrens.

==Protected area status==

===South Australian government===
The full extent of Lake Torrens has been protected as a national park under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; since 1991.

===Non-statutory arrangements===
Lake Torrens is part of an area known as the &quot;Inland Saline Lakes&quot; which has been listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia since at least 1995.

Lake Torrens has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area known as the &quot;Lake Torrens Important Bird Area&quot; (IBA) because it supported up to 100,000 breeding banded stilts during the major filling event of 1989. It may occasionally support over 1% of the world population of red-capped plovers. Cinnamon quail-thrushes are also common in the IBA.
==Exploratory drilling for minerals==
In April 2017 Kelaray, a subsidiary of mining company Argonaut Resources, secured native title permission to do exploratory drilling for iron, copper and gold under the lake, intending to work with traditional owners to “preserve and protect” important sites. The area was drilled in 2007 to 2008 without obtaining permission of the Kokatha people, who then held native title (see History, above). In February 2018, the South Australian Environment, Resources and Development (ERD) Court granted authority to enter and undertake mining operations (exploration) within those parts of the western area of the lake defined in an application by Argonaut. Some drilling was done in 2019, but was paused pending a technical review relating to the aquifer below the lake. In September 2020, representatives of the local Kuyani and Kokatha people raised concerns about further drilling proposals.

In January 2021, the state government under Steven Marshall granted permission to Kelaray to conduct drilling on the lake, over an area including Murdie Island, part of Andamooka Island, and part of Carrapateena Arm, after they had made an application under Section 23 of the &quot;Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988&quot;, &quot;to damage, disturb or interfere with any Aboriginal sites, objects or remains&quot;. Mitigation strategies to protect the environment include purpose-built mats which would be used on the lake&#x27;s surface to &quot;protect the salt crust&quot; from vehicles travelling over it, and the company intends to consult regularly with Aboriginal representatives. However Kuyani woman Regina McKenzie expressed concerns that her people were not consulted and no cultural assessments were made. The work, scheduled to begin in 2021, would &quot;target iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) copper mineralisation&quot;, similar to mines at Olympic Dam and Carrapateena mines. It has been called the Murdie project in Argonaut&#x27;s documentation.

Drilling was set to start from 15 March 2021, despite recommendations against doing so being provided to Marshall (who is also Aboriginal Affairs minister) by the state-government-appointed Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation and the State Aboriginal Heritage Committee (SAHC) and Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation (part of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet). 20 semi-trailer trucks delivered accommodation units and equipment to Murdie Island in preparation. In the same week, the Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation launched legal action to put a stop to the drilling, on the grounds that it is &quot;one of the most significant cultural sites in South Australia&quot;.

In August 2022, the Chief Justice of South Australia, Chris Kourakis, overturned Marshall&#x27;s decision, citing concerns that Kelaray&#x27;s heritage plan and procedures would &quot;substantially detract&quot; from the state’s Aboriginal heritage laws.

<doc id="994438" wikidata="Q1049736" url="?curid=994438" title="Wiglaf">
<text>Wiglaf (Proto-Norse: *&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;battle remainder&quot;; ) is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He is the son of Weohstan, a Swede of the Wægmunding clan who had entered the service of Beowulf, king of the Geats. Wiglaf is called &quot;Scylfing&quot; as a metonym for Swede, as the Scylfings were the ruling Swedish clan. While in the service of the Scylfing Onela, king of the Swedes, Weohstan killed the rebel prince Eanmund and took his sword as a trophy; Wiglaf later inherited it. Weohstan belonged to the clan of the Wægmundings, the same clan Beowulf&#x27;s father Ecgþeow belonged to; so Wiglaf is Beowulf&#x27;s distant cousin, and his only living relative at the time of Beowulf&#x27;s death.

Scholars have proposed various interpretations of Wiglaf&#x27;s role in the poem, but agree that he is important, and that he was Beowulf&#x27;s nephew, a key relationship in heroic tales of the period.

Wiglaf has a counterpart in Scandinavian sources named &quot;Hjalti&quot; who serves as a side-kick to Beowulf&#x27;s counterpart Bödvar Bjarki, and in &quot;Bjarkamál&quot;, Hjalti makes speeches comparable to those made by Wiglaf in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Beowulf==
Wiglaf first appears in &quot;Beowulf&quot; at line 2602, as a member of the band of thanes who go with Beowulf to seek out the dragon that has attacked Geat-Land. This is the first time Wiglaf has gone to war at Beowulf&#x27;s side. He is called a &quot;praise-worthy shield-warrior&quot;, a &quot;prince of the Scylfings&quot;, and &quot;mæg ælfheres&quot;, &quot;kinsman of Ælfhere.&quot;

When Beowulf damages his sword wounding the dragon and is burned by the dragon&#x27;s fire, Wiglaf is the only man of Beowulf&#x27;s band to overcome his fear of the dragon. He rebukes the other thanes and goes to Beowulf&#x27;s aid crying words of encouragement.

Wiglaf does not retreat, though his shield is consumed by fire. When Beowulf wounds the dragon a second time, striking so hard his sword shatters, Wiglaf strikes at the open wound with his own sword, tearing at the dragon&#x27;s throat so it can no longer breathe fire. His hand is badly burned, but his attack allows Beowulf to close and kill the dragon. The poet says of Wiglaf, &quot;So should a man be, a thane at need!&quot;

At Beowulf&#x27;s command, Wiglaf gathers treasure from the dragon&#x27;s lair and piles it where Beowulf can see it. The dying Beowulf tells Wiglaf to &quot;watch his people&#x27;s needs&quot; (by which he means that Wiglaf is to become the next king.) He tells Wiglaf to build him a funeral mound and gives Wiglaf his rings, helm, and mail-shirt. He says that Wiglaf is now &quot;the last of the Wægmundings.&quot;

The other eleven men that came with Beowulf gather around the body, and Wiglaf condemns them for their failure of duty and declares that he will order them exiled. He sends a messenger to tell the other Geats what has happened. When the Geats have gathered, Wiglaf addresses them, mourning Beowulf&#x27;s death and expressing dismay at the bleak future of the Geats without Beowulf to guard them.

Wiglaf&#x27;s last appearance is at line 3120, where he chooses seven thanes to help him push the dragon&#x27;s corpse over the cliff into the sea, loot the lair, and lay the treasure on Beowulf&#x27;s funeral pyre.

== Significance ==

=== Flees, and turns back ===
R. R. Lumiansky notes that while a common interpretation is that Wiglaf is the only one of Beowulf&#x27;s companions who does not flee, Wiglaf actually flees along with the cowardly companions, as he must be far away from the fight when he addresses the cowards. In this interpretation, Wiglaf then remembers his duty of kinship and the bravery of his father Weohstan. This brings a feeling of remorse, and he tries without success to persuade the companions; he returns to the fight alone. He then feels moved to encourage Beowulf, an action that could be seen as surprising from a youth facing his first fight to a heroic King, and at last to join the fight against the dragon.

=== A Wægmunding, Beowulf&#x27;s nephew ===
Norman E. Eliason notes that Wiglaf is a member of the Waegmundings, a Swedish clan. In his view, this is &quot;of crucial significance&quot;. As he dies, Beowulf gives Wiglaf his armour and torque, which Eliason glosses as &quot;very likely a royal emblem he had worn about his neck&quot;, noting that if he had had a son, he would have given this emblem to him. However, the poet, at this crucial moment, leaves the relationship between the two men vague, rather than doing the conventional thing in heroic verse of making it an uncle-nephew relationship, as scholars like Larry Benson have assumed, and like that of Beowulf and Hygelac. Eliason however disagrees with the widespread scholarly interpretation that Beowulf, too, was a Waegmunding, finding the suggestion that he was half-Swedish &quot;unthinkable or even ridiculous&quot;. But, he writes, the poet &quot;makes it clear that as a Geat Beowulf had to take vengeance on Onela and that as a Waegmunding he was entitled to Onela&#x27;s favour&quot;. This leads Eliason to suggest that Beowulf&#x27;s sister married Weohstan the Waegmunding, so Wiglaf is Beowulf&#x27;s nephew after all.

=== Allegory ===
Richard North revisits the old hypothesis that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; Wiglaf, and indeed the whole poem, was commissioned by the historical King Wiglaf of Mercia as a memorial to King Beornwulf, at the same time presenting himself as successor; he had been an ealdorman, not the King&#x27;s son, so the succession could have been in doubt. He notes the resemblance of the names (Beornwulf, Wiglaf) to the heroes in the poem, claiming that Wiglaf cannot be traced to any Scandinavian source.

The scholar Kevin Kiernan likens the survival of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript to Wiglaf&#x27;s survival of the last fight of Beowulf the hero, noting however that while Wiglaf&#x27;s efforts were all in vain, the manuscript somehow limped on.

=== Etymology ===
Wiglaf&#x27;s name appears to be an example of etymological refraction. The name is composed of two Old English elements, namely &quot;wig&quot; (fight, battle, war) and &quot;laf&quot; (what or who is left). When Wiglaf first enters battle alongside his lord, the poem is structured to reflect greater significance on his name. The separation and reversal of the elements of the name in the manuscript suggest that the name &quot;Wiglaf&quot; signifies &quot;the inheritor of strength&quot; or &quot;one that is fulfilled through battle&quot;, according to the scholars Patrick J. Gallacher and Helen Damico.

An alternate understanding of the name in the context of a typical dithematic name, where the two elements may be as independent in meaning as separate names, &quot;laf&quot; could be read as &quot;one who remains, one who survives or endures&quot;. Gallacher and Damico have acknowledged this alternative interpretation but feel that it is unnecessary to argue that one discernible element within a name submerges another as all interpretations are collectively useful in the pursuit of deep analysis.

==Cultural references==
In the 1981 animated film &quot;Grendel Grendel Grendel&quot;, Wiglaf (voiced by Ernie Bourne) is portrayed as one of Hrothgar&#x27;s thanes rather than an ally of Beowulf, and is killed by Grendel.

In the 2007 film &quot;Beowulf&quot; (directed by Robert Zemeckis), Wiglaf&#x27;s role (played by Brendan Gleeson) is larger; he is present in the film from the first introduction of Beowulf and the Geats to the end when Beowulf vanquishes the dragon and dies. The film makes Wiglaf into a sidekick, the second-in-command and the best friend of the epic hero.

<text>Open Cluster NGC 2175 (also known as OCL 476 or Cr 84) is an open cluster in the Orion constellation, embedded in a diffusion nebula. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and independently discovered by Karl Christian Bruhns in 1857. NGC 2175 is at a distance of about 6,350 light years away from Earth.

The nebula surrounding it is Sharpless catalog Sh 2-252, and it is sometimes called the Monkey Head Nebula due to its appearance.

There is some equivocation in the use of the identifiers NGC 2174 and NGC 2175. These may apply to the entire nebula, to its brightest knot, or to the star cluster it includes. Burnham&#x27;s &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; lists the entire nebula as 2174/2175 and does not mention the star cluster. The NGC Project (working from the original descriptive notes) assigns NGC 2174 to the prominent knot at J2000 , and NGC 2175 to the entire nebula, and by extension to the star cluster. Simbad uses NGC 2174 for the nebula and NGC 2175 for the star cluster.

<doc id="994449" wikidata="Q2451193" url="?curid=994449" title="Chicago (album)">
<text>Chicago (retroactively known as Chicago II) is the second studio album by the American rock band Chicago, released on January 26, 1970, by Columbia Records. Like their debut album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, it is a double album. It was their first album released under the name Chicago—the band&#x27;s prior name, Chicago Transit Authority, was changed due to a threatened lawsuit from the actual mass-transit operator bearing the same name—and the first to use the now ubiquitous cursive Chicago logo on the cover.

&quot;Chicago&quot; was commercially successful. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in April of the same year of its release, and certified platinum in 1991. It reached No. 4 on the album charts in the United States and No. 6 on the album charts in the UK, and produced three top ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album received three Grammy Award nominations: for Album of the Year, Contemporary Vocal Group, and Best Album Cover. It was voted best album of 1970 by readers of &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine, and the 1971 best small-combo LP by readers of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

==History==
The album was released in 1970 after the band had shortened its name from &quot;The Chicago Transit Authority&quot; following the release of their self-titled debut album the previous year, in order to avoid legal action being threatened by the actual mass-transit company. The official title of the album is &quot;Chicago&quot;, although it came to be known as Chicago II, keeping it in line with the succession of Roman numeral-titled albums that officially began with &quot;Chicago III&quot; in 1971.

&quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; was a success, yet &quot;Chicago&quot; is considered by many to be the group&#x27;s breakthrough album, yielding three singles that made it into the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, including &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (number 9), &quot;Colour My World&quot; (number 7), and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (number 4).

&quot;Chicago&quot; was released in January 1970 on Columbia Records and was an instant hit, reaching number 4 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and number 6 in the UK. Columbia Records was very active in promoting its quadraphonic four-channel surround-sound format in the mid-1970s, and nine of Chicago&#x27;s first ten albums were made available in quad. The quad mix features elements not heard in the standard stereo mix, including additional guitar work from virtuoso Terry Kath in &quot;25 Or 6 To 4&quot; and a different vocal take from Lamm in &quot;Wake Up Sunshine,&quot; which reveals a different lyric in the song&#x27;s last line.

In 2002, &quot;Chicago&quot; was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records with the single versions of &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; as bonus tracks. Rhino released a DVD-Audio version of the album in 2003, featuring both Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes. In 2016, British producer and musician Steven Wilson remixed &quot;Chicago&quot; from the original multitrack tapes. This version was released on January 27, 2017, by Rhino Records. A vinyl edition of the remix cut by Kevin Gray was released on August 11, 2017. Robert Lamm stated in an interview that the album has been nominated for the Grammy Hall of Fame more than once.

==Musical style, writing, composition==
In a 2015 article, &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; says the album saw Chicago&#x27;s, &quot;full immersion into mainstream success while still building on their fusion of rock, funk and jazz.&quot;

In Danny Seraphine&#x27;s book &quot;Street Player&quot;, he describes it this way: &quot;In between the dates of our touring schedule, we somehow found the opportunity to jump into CBS Studios in Los Angeles and record a second album in August 1969. Whereas the first record was a compilation of raw energy, we took a more controlled approach to our new effort.&quot;

The centerpiece of the album was the 13-minute song cycle &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; written by trombone player James Pankow, from which came the singles &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot;. Guitarist Terry Kath also participated in an extended classically styled cycle of four pieces, three of which were co-written by arranger, composer, and pianist Peter Matz. Politically outspoken keyboardist Robert Lamm expresses his qualms in &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;, another modular piece. Bassist Peter Cetera contributed his first song to Chicago with &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;.

== Recording, production ==
The album was produced by James William Guercio, who was Chicago&#x27;s producer for its first eleven albums, and was recorded in less than a month, during August 1969.

In 1970, James Pankow said about the album, &quot;We . . . think it is better recorded and better played than the first. None of us feel, though, that we are really a recording group yet. We are all scared in the studio. We are really a live group.&quot;

==Artwork, packaging==
The Chicago logo, which made its first appearance on the cover of this album, was designed by John Berg and fashioned by Nick Fasciano, who were both nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover for their efforts. John Berg said the Coca-Cola logo was the inspiration for the Chicago logo. The cover art work is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The band&#x27;s official web site labels the cover design, &quot;silver bar.&quot;

The double-LP album&#x27;s inner cover includes the playlist; the entire lyrics to &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;; a &quot;Producer&#x27;s Note&quot; stating, &quot;This endeavor should be experienced sequentially&quot;; and a declaration written by Robert Lamm, &quot;With this album, we dedicate ourselves, our futures and our energies to the people of the revolution. And the revolution in all of its forms.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, writer Al Rudis says Chicago&#x27;s second album &quot;confirms&quot; that &quot;Chicago is one of the most exciting, most original, and most accomplished jazz-rock groups in existence.&quot; whereas in a review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave a review of &quot;Chicago&quot; as a &quot;D+&quot; and called it &quot;sterile and stupid&quot;, writing that if &quot;Duke Ellington never got away with an extended work for horns and meaningfulness, [what] makes James William Guercio and the self-designated revolutionaries who are his cohorts think they can?&quot;

There have been positive retrospective reviews. Lindsay Planer from AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and said its songs &quot;underscore the solid foundation of complex jazz changes with heavy electric rock &amp; roll that the band so brazenly forged on the first set&quot;. Jim Beviglia, writing for &quot;American Songwriter,&quot; said, &quot;50 years after its release, &quot;Chicago II&quot; still stands as the one of the band’s signature achievements. ...Listening to &quot;Chicago II&quot; now, it is remarkable just how smoothly the various pieces blend together.&quot;

<doc id="994456" wikidata="Q159967" url="?curid=994456" title="Augusto Roa Bastos">
<text>Augusto Roa Bastos (13 June 1917 – 26 April 2005) was a Paraguayan novelist and short story writer. As a teenager he fought in the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia, and he later worked as a journalist, screenwriter and professor. He is best known for his complex novel &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; (&quot;I the Supreme&quot;) and for winning the &quot;Premio Miguel de Cervantes&quot; in 1989, Spanish literature&#x27;s most prestigious prize. &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; explores the dictations and inner thoughts of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, the eccentric dictator of Paraguay who ruled with an iron fist, from 1814 until his death in 1840.

Roa Bastos&#x27;s life and writing were marked by experience with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos&#x27;s work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by Guaraní words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos&#x27;s canon includes the novels &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; (1960; &quot;Son of Man&quot;) and &quot;El fiscal&quot; (1993; &quot;The Prosecutor&quot;), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.

== Biography ==

=== Early life (1917–1932) ===
Roa Bastos was born in Asunción on 13 June 1917. He spent his childhood in Iturbe, a provincial town in the Guaira region where his father was an administrator on a sugar plantation. It was here, some to the south of the Paraguayan capital of Asunción, that Roa Bastos learned to speak both Spanish and Guaraní, the language of Paraguay&#x27;s indigenous people. At the age of ten he was sent to school in Asunción where he stayed with his uncle, Hermenegildo Roa, the liberal bishop of Asunción.

His uncle&#x27;s extensive personal library provided the young Roa Bastos with his first exposure to the classical Spanish literature of the Baroque and Renaissance traditions that he would imitate in his early poetry throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In addition, his uncle&#x27;s emphasis on the mystical aspects of classic literature would have a profound Roa Bastos&#x27;s later writings. His experience of Guaraní social customs and language combined with the traditional Spanish education that he received in Asunción, created a cultural and linguistic duality that would manifest itself in much of Roa Bastos&#x27;s writing. His rural upbringing also exposed Roa Bastos to the exploitation and oppression of the indigenous and peasant peoples of Paraguay, which would become a prominent theme in his writing.

=== War and writing (1932–1947) ===
In 1932 the territorial Chaco War began between Paraguay and Bolivia and continued until 1935. At some point, perhaps as late as 1934, Roa Bastos joined the Paraguayan army as a medical auxiliary. The war would have a profound effect on the future writer who said: &quot;when I left for that war I dreamed of purification in the fire of battles.&quot; Instead of glory he found &quot;maimed bodies&quot; and &quot;destruction&quot; which left him to question &quot;why two brother countries like Bolivia and Paraguay were massacring each other&quot;, and as a consequence Roa Bastos became a pacifist.

Directly after the war he worked as a bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for &quot;Fulgencia Miranda&quot;, although the book was never published. In the early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later draw upon in his first published novel, &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; (&quot;1960; Son of Man&quot;). In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunción daily &quot;El País&quot;.

In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month fellowship for journalism in London. During this time he traveled extensively in Britain, France and Africa and witnessed the devastation of WWII first hand. He served as the &quot;El País&quot; war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General Charles de Gaulle after the latter&#x27;s return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs at the invitation of the BBC and France&#x27;s Ministry of Information.

Throughout this eventful period in his life Roa Bastos continued to write and he was considered a poet of the Paraguayan &quot;avant garde&quot;. In 1942 he published a book of poems in the classic Spanish style, which he titled &quot;El Ruiseñor De La Aurora&quot; (&quot;The Dawn Nightingale&quot;), a work he later renounced. He also had plays successfully performed during the 1940s, though they were never published. Of his prolific poetry of the late 1940s only &quot;El naranjal ardiente&quot; (1960; &quot;The Burning Orange Grove&quot;) was published.

=== Exile in Argentina (1947–1976) ===
During the 1947 Paraguayan Civil War, Roa Bastos was forced to flee to Buenos Aires, Argentina, because he had spoken out against President Higinio Moríñigo. About 500,000 of his fellow Paraguayans left for Argentina at the same time. Roa Bastos remained in Argentina until just before the establishment of the military dictatorship there in 1976, and he did not return permanently to Paraguay until 1989. He found exile difficult, but his time in Buenos Aires was a prolific period. Roa Bastos said this in reference to his exile:
I can&#x27;t complain...Exile brought out in me, in addition to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling for the universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which to know my own country from other people&#x27;s point of view, and from which to live for the enormity of its misfortune.
In 1953 the collection of 17 short stories &quot;El trueno entre las hojas&quot; (1953; &quot;Thunder Among the Leaves&quot;) was published and circulated internationally, but it was not until the 1960 publication of the novel &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; (&quot;Son of Man&quot;) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.

Roa Bastos further established himself as a screenwriter with the screenplay of &quot;Shunko&quot; (1960), directed by Lautaro Murúa and based on the memoirs of a country school teacher. In 1961 he once again collaborated with Murúa for &quot;Alias Gardelito&quot; (1961), which depicted the lives of urban petty criminals and became a major independent film of the &quot;nuevo cine&quot; movement. In 1974 Roa Bastos published his influential masterpiece &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;, the result of seven years&#x27; work. When Jorge Rafael Videla&#x27;s military dictatorship came to power in 1976, however, the book was banned in Argentina, and Roa Bastos was exiled once again, this time to Toulouse, France.

=== France (1976–1989) ===
In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaraní and Spanish literature at the University of Toulouse. Although he had been allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities. There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane&#x27;s English translation of &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; (&quot;I the Supreme&quot;), published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos&#x27;s writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos retired from the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andrés Rodríguez.

=== Return to Paraguay and Cervantes Prize (1989–2005) ===
Following the toppling of the Stroessner regime, Roa Bastos won the Premio Cervantes (Cervantes Prize), awarded by the Spanish Royal Academy in partnership with the Spanish government, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Spanish-language literature. It was at this time that Roa Bastos began to travel frequently between Paraguay and France. In 1991, representing Paraguay, Roa Bastos signed &quot;The Morelia Declaration&quot; &quot;demanding the reversal of the ecological destruction of the planet.&quot; It was at this time that Roa Bastos again became an active novelist and screenwriter.

In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; for the screen. His first novel since &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;, &quot;Vigilia del almirante&quot; (1992; &quot;Vigil of the Admiral&quot;) was published in 1992, and &quot;El fiscal&quot; (1993; &quot;The Prosecutor&quot;) the following year. Although neither of his later novels had the impact of his earlier work, &quot;El fiscal&quot; is considered an important work. Roa Bastos died on 26 April 2005 in Asunción from a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his third wife, Iris Giménez, and a reputation as one of Latin American&#x27;s finest writers.

== Major works ==

=== &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; ===

&quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; (1960; &quot;Son of Man&quot;), Roa Bastos&#x27;s first published and award-winning novel, represents his definitive break with poetry. It is seen as a refined &quot;outgrowth&quot; of his earlier works of short fiction such as &quot;El trueno entre las hojas&quot; (1953), which also dealt with themes of political oppression and social struggle in Paraguay. This novel portrays the conflict between the governing élite and the oppressed masses in Paraguay from 1912 until just after the end of the Chaco War with Bolivia in 1936. Like his later &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;, &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; draws upon a series of Paraguayan legends and stories dating back to start of Dr. Francia&#x27;s dictatorship in 1814.

&quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; builds upon a system of Christian metaphors as part of the Neobaroque concept of Magic Realism, in order to examine the pain of being Paraguayan. This novel contrasts two figures: Miguel Vera and Cristóbal Jara. Vera narrates the odd chapters, although he might also be the narrator of all nine chapters (this is unclear). He is a well-to-do and educated romantic supporter of revolution, who is unable to take real action to support his ideals and in the end betrays them (not unlike Judas). Jara, on the other hand, is an uneducated &quot;son of man&quot; who becomes a Christ-like leader for Paraguayan people through action and strength of character. Although it was a massive critical success, Roa Bastos remained dissatisfied with the work for a number reasons. It was fourteen years before he published another novel.

=== &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; ===


&quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; (&quot;I the Supreme&quot;) is a fictionalized account of the 19th-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as &quot;Dr. Francia&quot;. The book&#x27;s title derives from the fact that Francia referred to himself as &quot;El Supremo&quot; or &quot;The Supreme.&quot; The first in a long line of dictators, The Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. He ruled absolutely from 1814 until his death in 1840, and is a unique figure in Latin American history. The goal of his rule mirrored that of the Jesuits who had ruled Paraguay for much of its history before him: to keep the Paraguayan people and their customs pure by protecting them from the corrupting influence of European and other outside forces. In &quot;Yo, el supremo&quot;, Roa Bastos is also fundamentally concerned with the power (and the weakness) of writing itself: its plot revolves around the dictator&#x27;s efforts to uncover who has been forging his signature on a series of pasquinades discovered around the capital, and his relationship with his secretary, Patiño, to whom he dictates his thoughts and orders, but whom he never fully trusts.

The novel itself is &quot;an exceptional cultural phenomenon.&quot; It has been suggested that it &quot;[is] more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, [and the] strictly historical importance [may] be even greater than that of García Márquez&#x27;s fabulously successful creation.&quot; &quot;Yo, el supremo&quot; has contributed widely to a number of different genres and styles. It belongs to the genre of &quot;novelas de dictadores&quot; or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. &quot;Yo, el supremo&quot; is also an important milestone in the evolution of the historical novel genre. &quot;Yo, el supremo weaves a plethora of formats into a single work: history, novel, sociological essay, moral philosophy, biographical novel, revolutionary pamphlet, testimonial documentary, poetic prose, autobiographic confession, ideological debate over literary limits, and linguistic treatise on the limits of verbal expression.&quot;

=== &quot;El Fiscal&quot; ===
&quot;El Fiscal&quot; (1993; &quot;The Prosecutor&quot;), is the third novel of the trilogy written by Augusto Roa Bastos. These three works contemplate what the author has termed “the monotheism of power.” The Prosecutor explores the atrocities of the Alfredo Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay, which lasted from 1954 to 1989. The novel links the protagonist to Paraguay&#x27;s past as he struggles to give meaning to his life by assassinating the dictator and freeing the Paraguayan people. Combining autobiography, detective fiction, historical novel and philosophy, the novel examines the question of whether one man has the right to judge another. Helene Carol Weldt-Basson&#x27;s translation was published in 2018 (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press; Annotated edition (20 February 2018)); she is professor of Spanish and Latin American literature at University of North Dakota.

== Precursors and influences ==
Ruy Díaz de Guzmán&#x27;s &quot;Anales del descubrimiento, población y conquista del Río de la Plata&quot;, is considered one of the most important antecedents to Roa Bastos&#x27;s writings. Guzmán, a Paraguayan explorer of Guaraní and Spanish heritage, wrote extensively about the geography of Paraguay using mythical descriptions of the landscape and the Guaraní language. The most important precursor to Roa Bastos, however, is Rafael Barrett (1876–1910), whose writings incorporated many of the important themes and writings styles that Roa Bastos would later master including: Spanish-Guaraní bilingualism, magic realism, the revision of Paraguayan history, social literature, exploration of collective memory and the universe of poetic symbols. Barrett&#x27;s essay &quot;Lo que son los yerbales&quot; is a severe critique of the exploitation of workers on &quot;yerba mate&quot; tea plantations. Roa Bastos spent part of the early 1940s documenting this same issue and there is much speculation about the role of &quot;Lo que son los yerbales&quot; in the creation of his first major novel &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot;. The Uruguayan writer Horacio Quiroga is another important predecessor.

== Style ==
Roa Bastos was an exponent of the Neobaroque style that brought Latin American literature to the fore internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very closely tied to the land, flora and culture of the particular writer, especially in the case of Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (&quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.

Roa Bastos started out writing poetry in the Spanish Renaissance and Baroque traditions. Later he took on &quot;a new sensibility&quot; in response to the poetry of Valle-Inclán, Juan Ramón Jiménez, and García Lorca. However, it is as a prose-fiction writer Roa Bastos has built his considerable reputation, through his novels and numerous short stories. Roa Bastos&#x27;s novels blend the present and past by creating scenes with myths from pre-colonial times and Christian legends, developing a special kind of Magic Realism, although there are significant stylistic variations between his major novels.

== Themes ==

=== Paraguay: collective memory ===
The majority of Roa Bastos&#x27;s work was written in exile owing to the oppressive political condition of his country, at a time when Paraguay was one of the least culturally, economically, and politically developed countries in Latin America. Thus, much of Roa Bastos&#x27;s important writing is an attempt to &quot;capture the tragic essence, the &#x27;inner weakness&#x27; as well as the inner strength of his country&#x27;s people.&quot; His work reveals an intense preoccupation not only with contemporary Paraguay but with its history, looking back to the beginning of the 19th century and the rule of Dr. Gaspar de Francia (whose life is the focus of &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;). While key historical figures and events interest Roa Bastos, it is the impact of these &quot;socio-historical roots&quot; on &quot;the nature of the masses&quot; that forms the central theme of his literary work.

His writing deploys symbols and multiple narratives that build on the collective memory of the Paraguayan people. &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot;, for example, constructs an &quot;alternative history of popular movements&quot; out of the people&#x27;s recollections and symbols. The intertextual novel &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; is particularly representative of this technique, both in its construction and narrative. In &quot;El Fiscal&quot; (1993), a third novel about the abuses of political power—this time focusing on Stroessner&#x27;s régime—Roa Bastos again offers an alternative to the accepted versions of events in Paraguay and challenges &quot;the intelligibility of history&quot;. To this end he weaves elements of fantasy and metafiction into his narratives.

=== Humanism and the engaged writer ===
Roa Bastos believed that it was the role of the writer to directly engage in the interpretation of both contemporary and historical events. Rather than be the objective &quot;chronicler&quot;, he thought the writer should engage morally with the social problems depicted in the writing. According to Roa Bastos, ”literary activity has come to signify the necessity for facing up to a destiny, the will to enlist in the vital reality of a collectivity, in its true moral context and social structure, in the complex relationships of a contemporary reality – that is to say, by projecting themselves toward a universal world of man.” Thus, one of the major themes in the writing of Roa Bastos is a deep and universal humanism, with a particular focus on suffering

Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos&#x27;s own experiences played a significant role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot;. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, &quot;El Trueno entre las Hojas&quot;, set the stage for &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot; and &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos&#x27;s idea of the &quot;engaged writer&quot;. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay&#x27;s first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.

=== Bilingualism ===
As is customary for most Paraguayans of peasant or working class origins, Roa Bastos learned to speak Spanish and Guaraní from birth. Both Spanish and Guaraní are the official languages of Paraguay (the latter is primarily an oral language). Although Guaraní remains the &quot;popular&quot; language spoken at home and on the &quot;street&quot;, Spanish is the language of official business and of power. The preservation and widespread use of an indigenous language after centuries of European immigration is unique in Latin America, and Guarani remains a symbol of Paraguayan nationalism and an &quot;important vehicle for interpreting the country&#x27;s reality&quot;. This is the legacy of the Jesuits who ruled Paraguay in the 18th century and used Guarani (instead of Spanish or Latin) to spread Christianity throughout Paraguay.

While Roa Bastos wrote primarily in Spanish, the interplay between these two languages is an essential part of his style. His bilingualism gives Roa Bastos a much greater range of language to work with, but also creates tension between an internationally recognized language and one that is obscure and fiercely Paraguayan. Roa Bastos has described the relationship between the two languages as &quot;an almost schizophrenic split not only on communicational levels of the spoken language, but also and quite particularly in the literary language.&quot;

== Honors and distinctions ==
Over the course of his career, Roa Bastos received a diversity of honors and distinctions. In 1941 he won the Ateneo Paraguayo Prize for his (unpublished) novel &quot;Fulgencio Miranda&quot;. This first award was followed by a British Council fellowship for journalism that enabled him to travel to Europe during World War II. In 1959 Roa Bastos won the Losada prize for his first published novel &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot;. The adaptation of this novel, for which he wrote the screenplay, won best film in the Spanish language and first prize of the Argentine Instituto de Cinematografia the following year. His most prestigious awards include two John Guggenheim Foundation Fellowships, awarded in 1970 and 1979, and the Cervantes Prize, an award given by the Spanish government for lifetime achievement, and Spanish language literature&#x27;s most prestigious prize, which he received in 1989. Roa Bastos donated most of his prize money to provide easier access to books in Paraguay. In 1995, he received Paraguay&#x27;s National Prize for Literature. In 1997 France distinguished him as Chevalier of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur.

== Legacy ==
The writing of Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his lifetime he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, and to the &quot;Nuevo Cine&quot; film movement through screenplays like &quot;Alias Gardelito&quot; (1961). Roa Bastos&#x27;s influence can be found in the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos&#x27;s relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay&#x27;s new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.

Even before &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot;, Roa Bastos was considered part of &quot;the pantheon of great writers&quot; by some critics, due to &quot;Hijo de hombre&quot;. However, it was the former work that cemented his place as a significant literary figure. According to Juan Manuel Marcos, &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; &quot;anticipates many of the post-boom writing techniques&quot; such as &quot;the carnivalization of historical discourse, transtextualization, and parody&quot;. Mexican literary great, Carlos Fuentes has called &quot;Yo, el Supremo&quot; one of the milestones in Latin American literature. While his reputation rests on his novels, Roa Bastos&#x27;s achievements in film, creative writing, and journalism add further substance to his legacy.

<text>NGC 2204 is an open cluster of stars in the Canis Major constellation. It was discovered by the German-English astronomer William Herschel on 6 February 1785. The cluster has an integrated visual magnitude of 8.6 and spans a diameter of . Resolving the individual member stars is a challenge with a 10 to 12-inch amateur telescope. It is located at a distance of approximately 13,400 light years from the Sun. The cluster shows a mean radial velocity of relative to the Sun, and is orbiting the inner galactic disk region about 1 kpc below the galactic plane.

This is a rich but diffuse cluster with a Trumpler class of III 3m, spanning a physical diameter of about . It is an older cluster with an estimated age of . The metallicity is correspondingly poor, showing an abundance of iron about 59% of that in the Sun. There is a prominent giant branch clump on the HR diagram. The cluster has a significant population of blue stragglers, an indicator of past stellar mergers. It has a pair of candidate chemically peculiar stars, and five variable stars have been discovered, including four eclipsing variables.

<text>NGC 2360 (also known as Caroline&#x27;s Cluster or Caldwell 58) is an open cluster in the constellation Canis Major. It was discovered on 26 February 1783 by Caroline Herschel, who described it as a &quot;beautiful cluster of pretty compressed stars near 1/2 degree in diameter&quot;. Her notes were overlooked until her brother William included the cluster in his 1786 catalogue of 1000 clusters and nebulae and acknowledged her as the discoverer. The cluster lies 3.5 degrees east of Gamma Canis Majoris and less than one degree northwest of the eclipsing binary star R Canis Majoris; it has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. It is 13 arc minutes in diameter. By the western edge of the cluster is the unrelated star, 5.5-magnitude HD 56405.

American astronomer Olin J. Eggen surveyed the cluster in 1968, concluding that the brightest star in the field, magnitude-8.96 HD 56847, is likely to lie in the field and not a true member of the cluster. He also identified one or possibly two blue stragglers. These are unexpectedly hot and luminous stars that appear younger than surrounding stars, and have likely developed by sucking matter off companion stars. Four are now recognised to be in the cluster. By analysing the masses of the smallest stars that have evolved into red giants—namely, stars of 1.8 or 1.9 solar masses—Swiss astronomers Jean-Claude Mermilliod and Michel Mayor were able to date the age of the cluster at 2.2 billion years. The cluster has a diameter of around 15 light-years and is located 3700 light-years from Earth.

<text>Xujiahui (, , romanized as: Zikawei, Ziccawei, or Siccawei) is a locality in Shanghai. It is a historic area of commerce and culture administratively within Xuhui District, which is named after the locality. The area is a well-known precinct for shopping and entertainment in Shanghai. It is served by the Xujiahui Station of the Shanghai Metro.

== Name ==

Xujiahui means &quot;Xu family junction&quot; - more precisely, &quot;property of Xu family at the junction of two rivers&quot;. The &quot;Xu family&quot; refers to the family of Xu Guangqi (Hsü Kuang-ch&#x27;i; 1562–1633), China&#x27;s most notable Catholic convert. Most of what is now Xujiahui was once the ancestral home of the Xu family. Baptized by famed Italian Jesuit, Matteo Ricci, Xu Guangqi and his descendants donated large plots of land to the Catholic Church, including the site of the St. Ignatius Cathedral.

During the 18th century it was known by Shanghai&#x27;s western residents as &quot;Ziccawei&quot; or &quot;Siccawei&quot; in English, and &quot;Zikawei&quot; or &quot;Zi-ka-wei&quot; in French, from the pronunciation of its name in Shanghainese. These names survive in the names of some institutions, such as the Bibliotheca Zi-Ka-Wei, and the area is still listed in a number of contemporary guidebooks and literature as &quot;Zikawei&quot; or some variant thereof.

== History ==

With land donated by Xu Guangqi&#x27;s family and those acquired by other means, the Society of Jesus established a grand cathedral as well as an entire one square mile complex that covers most of present-day Xujiahui. In addition to the cathedral, the French Jesuits also built orphanages, monasteries, schools, libraries and the (now the Shanghai Bureau of Meteorology).

In time, it became a stronghold of Catholics in East Asia. One of the first structures to be built by the Jesuits was the St. Ignatius Cathedral in 1847, later reconstructed in 1906. The Cathedral is located on what is now known as North Caoxi Road and is still referred to in English as the St. Ignatius Cathedral. The sign on the street calls it simply &quot;Catholic Church.&quot; The cathedral was featured in the opening scenes of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;.
A number of other structures survive from its days as a center of Catholicism. One is the Collège Saint Ignace or Xuhui College on 68 Hongqiao Road, now renamed Xuhui High School (or Xuhui Middle School). Established by Jesuits in 1850, Xuhui (St. Ignatius) College was the first educational institution in China to offer a fully western curriculum. Another is the &quot;Bibliotheca Zikawei&quot; (or &quot;Bibliotheque de Mission&quot;), now a branch of Shanghai Library, adjacent to the cathedral. Several of the convent buildings scattered around Xujiahui are still visible in various states of preservation: one (structurally modified but still recognizable) serves as the office of the Xuhui District Government and People&#x27;s Procurate. The Tou-Se-We Orphanage (Mandarin: Tushanwan) operated by the church, whose workshops supplied much of the religious art on Xujiahui&#x27;s religious buildings, is half a mile to the south of Xujiahui junction; the sole surviving building of the orphanage is now the Tou-Se-We Museum.

The educational institutions founded by the Catholic church led to Xujiahui&#x27;s reputation as a center of education. The Aurora University was founded by the Jesuits in Xujiahui. The imperial Nanyang Public School system was founded in Xujiahui at the end of the 19th century, and the historic main campus of its most prominent descendent school, Jiao Tong University, one of Shanghai&#x27;s most prestigious, is still located in Xujiahui. Fudan University, also one of Shanghai&#x27;s most prestigious, was located in Xujiahui until 1922.

While central Xujiahui was administratively part of the Chinese area of Shanghai, it was in reality controlled by the Catholic Church, which was closely associated with the French authorities of the French Concession. From 1914, Xujiahui sat just outside the borders of the French Concession, and remained under heavy French influence.

Catholic Xujiahui came to an abrupt end with the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. A few years after the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered Shanghai, the Jesuits abandoned Xujiahui and relocated to nearby posts such as Macau or Manila. Many of those who remained were imprisoned by Communist authorities. These include Cardinal Ignatius Kung, who spent decades in prison, and Father Chang-min &quot;Beda&quot; Chang, who died in prison in November 1951.
From 1949 onwards, most of the large houses and estates in Xujiahui were compulsarily acquired or seized by the government and converted into factories. Up until the late 1990s, the area was predominantly an industrial area.
During the late 1990s, many of the state-owned factories were sold off and torn down. Xujiahui is now mainly a retail district of downtown Shanghai.

== Economy ==

Xujiahui today is mainly a commercial area, though the Catholic church retains a significant presence and there are still educational and scientific institutions in the area.

The main Xujiahui shopping district is centered on the intersection of the streets Hongqiao Rd, Huashan Rd, Zhaojiabang Rd and North Caoxi Rd. Each of these streets terminates at the intersection, which is home to three supermarkets, six major shopping malls and nine large-scale office towers. (Clockwise from Hongqiao Road, Grand Gateway, Huashan Road, Pacific Sogo, Hengshan Road Tunnel, Huijin Department Store, Zhaojiabang Road, Metro-City, North Caoxi Road, Oriental Shopping Mall.) Everything from cosmetics to cars to cucumbers is available within five minutes, but the type of product that Xujiahui is most famous for is electronics. It is one of the biggest places for people to get electronic equipment, from cameras to PSPs to Xboxes and modchips for those Xboxes and other game consoles as well. However, the biggest shopping mall for electronic equipment has closed in 2016. Currently, a brand new shopping center is under construction, it is located on Hongqiao Road, right beside the Grand Gateway. The new shopping center will officially open in 2016.

==Education==
The historic main campus of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University is located in Xujiahui, to the north of the Xujiahui junction. While due to space limitations the university has moved its undergraduate department to a new campus on the outskirts of Shanghai, the Xujiahui campus still houses the university&#x27;s School of International Education and several research institutes. The campus is notable for a number of historic buildings dating from the early 20th century, including its imperial-style gate and remnants of the imperial-style marble bridges, reflecting the university&#x27;s former status as the Imperial Polytechnic.

The former Collège Saint Ignace, founded in 1850 and now Xuhui High School, is still in Xujiahui.

The former Shanghai Medical University, now Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, is located close to Xujiahui metro station.

The Bibliotheca Zi-Ka-Wei (Xujiahui Library) is in the area.

==Parks==
On the location of a former brick factory now stands the Xujiahui park, which was completed in 2002. The park also contains a manmade meandering brook (miniature model of the course of the Huangpu River), basketball courts, and a children&#x27;s playground. The park is traversed by a roughly 250 meter (820 feet)-long elevated pathway. The eastern part of the park features the historic Red House, which once housed the Pathé China record company. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music - also located in Xuhui district - often stages free performances during the Spring and Autumn months in the park, as these are the times when weather in Shanghai is the best.

The other notable park in Xujiahui is Guangqi Park, which features the tomb of Xu Guangqi, after whom the area and district are ultimately named. The tomb, recently restored according to its original set-up, is a curious combination of a large Christian cross as the grave marker, with a traditional Chinese &quot;spirit way&quot; lined with stone animals. Also located in the park is a traditional house relocated here as a result of urban redevelopment elsewhere in the district.

== Transportation ==
The main intersection at Xujiahui is a transportation hub. It is served by dozens of bus routes, and by the Xujiahui metro station on Lines 1, 9 and 11 of the Shanghai Metro.

== Xujiahui Subdistrict ==
Xujiahui Subdistrict was established in May 1994 as a subdistrict of Xuhui District, Shanghai. The subdistrict covers . There are 31,624 households which total 94,872 residents. There are roughly 110,000 permanent residents in the district. The subdistrict is not co-extensive with the geographical locality.

<doc id="994479" wikidata="Q41624" url="?curid=994479" title="Erna Schneider Hoover">
<text>Erna Schneider Hoover (born June 19, 1926) is an American mathematician notable for inventing a computerized telephone switching method which &quot;revolutionized modern communication&quot;. It prevented system overloads by monitoring call center traffic and prioritizing tasks on phone switching systems to enable more robust service during peak calling times. At Bell Laboratories where she worked for over 32 years, Hoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology.

==Early life==
Erna Schneider was born on June 19, 1926, in Irvington, New Jersey. Her family lived in South Orange, New Jersey and her father was a dentist and her mother was a teacher. She had a younger brother who died from polio at the age of five. She loved swimming, sailing, canoeing, and was interested in science at an early age. According to one source, she read the biography of Marie Curie which suggested to her that she could succeed in a scientific field despite the prevailing ideas about gender roles at the time. She graduated from Columbia High School in nearby Maplewood in 1944, which would later induct her into its hall of fame in 2007.

Hoover attended Wellesley College where she studied classical and medieval philosophy and history. She graduated from Wellesley in 1948 with honors, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and was honored as a &quot;Durant Scholar&quot;. She earned her PhD from Yale University in philosophy and foundations of mathematics in 1951.

== Personal life ==
While at Yale, she met Charles Wilson Hoover, Jr. She married him in 1953, during her three year stint teaching at Swarthmore (1951-1954). They had three daughters.

==Career==
Hoover was a professor at Swarthmore College from 1951 to 1954 where she taught philosophy and logic. However, she had been unable to win a tenure-track position, possibly because of her gender and marital status, according to one view. Her husband was very supportive of his wife&#x27;s career pursuits. When they moved to Summit, New Jersey in 1954, for his new job at Bell Laboratories, she had difficulty finding a teaching job. Instead, she joined her husband&#x27;s employer as a senior technical associate, and was promoted in 1956. According to one source, the internal training program was the &quot;equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree in computer science.&quot; Switching systems were moving from electronic to computer-based technologies. Problems happened when a call center would be inundated with thousands of calls in a short amount of time, overwhelming the unreliable electronic relays, and causing the entire system to &quot;freeze up.&quot;

Hoover used her knowledge of symbolic logic and feedback theory to program the control mechanisms of a call center to use data about incoming calls to impose order on the whole system. It used computer electronic methods to monitor the frequency of incoming calls at different times. Her method gave priority to processes that were concerned with the input and output of the switch over processes that were less important such as record keeping and billing. The computer, as a result, would adjust the call center&#x27;s acceptance rate automatically, greatly reducing the overloading problem. The system became known as stored program control.

Hoover&#x27;s thinking about the invention happened while she was in a hospital recuperating after having given birth to her second daughter, according to several sources. Lawyers for Bell Labs handling the patent had to go to her house to visit her while she was on maternity leave so that she could sign the papers. The result of the invention was much more robust service to callers during peak load times:
For her invention, termed &quot;Feedback Control Monitor for Stored Program Data Processing System&quot;, Hoover was awarded patent #3,623,007 in November 1971, one of the first software patents ever issued. The patent was applied for in 1967 and issued in 1971. As a result of her invention, she became the first woman supervisor of a technical department at Bell Labs. She headed the operations support department in 1987. The principles of her invention are still being used in telecommunications equipment in the 21st century.

Hoover worked on various high-level applications such as research radar control programs of the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System, which were systems to intercept incoming intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. Her department worked on artificial intelligence methods, large databases, and transactional software to support large telephone networks. She worked at Bell Labs for 32 years until retiring in 1987. In addition, she served on the boards of higher education organizations in New Jersey. As a member of the board of Trustees of The College of New Jersey, she was described as a visionary who was instrumental in increasing women faculty as well as enrolling the &quot;best prepared high school graduates&quot; in the state, and she helped build the college into a respected institution of higher education by lobbying extensively for state funding.

==Awards==
She was awarded one of the first patents for computer software. She was elected as a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. She received the Wellesley College alumni achievement award. In 2020, the College of New Jersey awarded her an honorary degree for services to higher education in New Jersey, after her time on their board. Schneider Hoover was the recipient of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology&#x27;s 2023 Pioneer Award.

Her invention laid the groundwork for the interconnected communication systems we witness today. While her initial system has evolved and integrated with modern advancements, the fundamental principles of automated telephone switching systems persist. The legacy of Erna Schneider Hoover&#x27;s work endures in the seamless and efficient communication networks that underpin contemporary society, particularly in business-to-customer interactions. Her life&#x27;s work not only transformed the telecommunications industry but also paved the way for future generations of women in science and technology.

<text>The Washington Huskies are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Washington, located in Seattle. The school competes at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level as a member of the Big Ten Conference.

Washington students, sports teams, and alumni are called Huskies. The husky was selected as the school mascot by the Associated Students of UW in 1922. It replaced the &quot;Sun Dodger&quot;, an abstract reference to the local weather that was quickly dropped in favor of something more tangible. The costumed &quot;Harry the Husky&quot; performs at sporting and special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs, traditionally leads the football team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote. The choice was purportedly inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot;.

On-campus facilities include Husky Stadium (football), Hec Edmundson Pavilion (basketball, gymnastics and volleyball), Husky Ballpark (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium (softball), the Nordstrom Tennis Center, the Dempsey Indoor practice facility, and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing). Recently added was the Husky Track located just north of the Husky Ballpark. The golf team&#x27;s home course is at the Washington National Golf Club in Auburn. &quot;Montlake&quot; is used as a metonym for the athletic department and its teams, with most on-campus facilities located north of the Montlake Cut and on or near Montlake Boulevard in Seattle.

== Sports sponsored ==

The University of Washington sponsors teams in nine men&#x27;s and twelve women&#x27;s NCAA-sanctioned sports, plus men&#x27;s rowing, primarily competing in the Pac-12 Conference, with men&#x27;s rowing in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association and both track and field programs in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

===Football===
The university football team&#x27;s first game was in 1889.

On November 20, 1903 Chief Joseph and his nephew Red Thunder watched a game that ended 2 - 0, a score on safety and Washington victory, and he concluded that &quot;I saw a lot of white men almost fight today. I do not think this good. I feel pleased that Washington won the game. Those men I would think would break their legs and arms, but they did not get mad. I had a good time at the game with my white friends.&quot; This both spirited approval and set a precedent for many victories, as during this period, Washington won 40 games in a row under coach Gil Dobie, currently the second longest winning streak in NCAA Division I-A history. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 64 consecutive games, an NCAA Division I-A record. In 1916, Dobie finished his remarkable coaching career at Washington with an undefeated 58–0–3 record.

The 1925 team posted an undefeated record but lost to Alabama 21–20 in the Rose Bowl. The 1960 team finished 10–1, under coach Jim Owens, and won its second consecutive Rose Bowl by defeating national champion Minnesota 17–7 (the national champion was declared before the bowl games in 1960). Coach Owens served from 1957 to 1974. Don James became head coach in 1975 and transformed the team into a national power while compiling a 153–57–2 record. James&#x27; first successful year was in 1977 with the team quarterbacked by Warren Moon culminating in a 27–20 victory over Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Washington and Michigan played again in the 1981 Rose Bowl, a 23–6 loss. The next year, the Huskies returned to the Rose Bowl and defeated Iowa 28–0, the last Rose Bowl shutout and the only shutout in the past half century. Following a two-year hiatus during which cross-state rival WSU prevented the Huskies from Rose Bowl appearances by defeating them in the last game of the 1982 and 1983 seasons, in 1984 Washington posted an 11–1 record and beat Oklahoma 28–17 to win the Orange Bowl. Senior running back, Jacque Robinson won the MVP award and was the first player to win MVP awards for both the Orange and Rose Bowls.

The 1991 team is considered to be the best Washington Husky football team and among the best in college football history. The team went undefeated, winning against opponents by an average score of 42–9 in regular season, including wins over No. 9 Nebraska, No. 7 California and a 34–14 win over No. 4 Michigan in the Rose Bowl. In 2000, Washington finished with an 11–1 record, and won its seventh Rose Bowl under the leadership of Marques Tuiasosopo.
Washington officially claims two national championships in football: 1960 and 1991. Washington was selected in 1960 by the Helms Athletic Foundation and in 1991 by the Coaches Poll and other selectors.

===Men&#x27;s golf===
The men&#x27;s golf team has won seven Pac-12 Conference championships: 1961, 1963, 1988, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2022. James Lepp won the NCAA (individual) Championship in 2005.

===Women&#x27;s golf===
The women&#x27;s golf team won their first NCAA national championship in 2016 by beating Stanford 3–2. In 1961 Judy Hoetmer won the women&#x27;s national intercollegiate individual golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports through 1981, the first year of the rival NCAA women&#x27;s golf championship).

===Rowing===

The University of Washington rowing is a longstanding tradition at the UW dating back to 1899. The Washington men&#x27;s crew won the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, defeating the German and Italian crews, chronicled in the 2023 film The Boys in the Boat.

The crew&#x27;s traditional rival has been the other West Coast powerhouse, the University of California Golden Bears.

==Former sports==

===Swimming===

The University of Washington swimming team dates back to 1932 when the men&#x27;s team was founded. The women&#x27;s team was founded in 1975. In 2009 the athletic department announced both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs would be eliminated due to a $2.8 million budget cut in the athletic department. In 2000 the it was announced that both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team would be cut but an outpouring of mail and phone calls, plus concern in the media about discontinuing the sport, led to a reversal of the decision and both programs were reinstated. In 1975 UW announced it was cutting the men&#x27;s team, citing financial issues involved in having to implement a new women&#x27;s program to comply with Title IX and decreasing revenue from a shaky economy and a struggling football team. The men&#x27;s team was reinstated a couple of months later but with fewer scholarships.

Throughout the history of the swimming programs at UW there were many successful athletes to compete for the huskies. The UW swimming program produced several Olympic medalists. These include Jack Medica, Rick and Lynn Colella, Rick DeMont, Doug Northway, and Robin Backhaus. In the 1970&#x27;s the men&#x27;s team had multiple top five finishes at the NCAA championship meet. In 2008, the year before the program was eliminated, the women&#x27;s team finished 15th while the men&#x27;s team finished 16th at the NCAA championship.

===Wrestling===
The men&#x27;s wrestling team at Washington was cut in 1980. The highlight of the program came in 1972 when UW wrestler Larry Owings defeated Dan Gable of Iowa State in the NCAA 142-pound championship. Gable, a senior competing in his final college match, had been undefeated in seven years and 181 matches of high-school and college wrestling. Gable never would lose again, including in the 1972 Olympics when he was unscored upon on his way to a gold medal. The upset over Gable by Owings was called &quot;one of the most unforgettable moments in the history of the sport and possibly all sport&quot; by The Chicago Tribune.

As a team the Huskies won three Pac-8 championships and finished in the top 10 at the NCAA national meet several times. The Amateur Wrestling News rated Washington among the 20 best college programs of the 1970s.

==Notable non-varsity sports==

===Boxing===
Both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s boxing teams compete in the National Collegiate Boxing Association. The Huskies won the very first NCBA national women&#x27;s championship in 2014, and won again in 2015 and 2016.

===Rugby===
Founded in 1963, the University of Washington Husky Rugby Club plays college rugby in Division 1 in the Northwest Collegiate Rugby Conference against local rivals such as Washington State and Oregon. The Huskies won the Northwest championship in 1996, 2002, 2004 and 2005 and the D1AA Varsity Cup in 2014. The Huskies rugby team is partially funded by an endowment from the alumni association.

===Lacrosse===
The University of Washington Husky Lacrosse Club plays college lacrosse in the Division 1 of the Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) against local rivals such as Washington State, Oregon, Oregon St. and Western Washington. The Lacrosse team plays their home games on the IMA fields, and are regularly attended and popular amongst UW students; especially when in-state rival, Washington St. comes into town. The Husky&#x27;s Lacrosse team is funded by annual dues paid by the players, as well as assistance from the IMA, and fundraisers.

==National championships==

The Washington Huskies have won 9 NCAA team championships, 35 non-NCAA rowing national championships (1 AIAW), and 10 other team national championships. They also claim 2 national championships in college football. The championships are as follows:

=== NCAA team championships ===


=== Football ===
Washington claims two national championships in college football: 1960 and 1991.

The 1960 team was selected by the Helms Athletic Foundation following Washington&#x27;s victory over AP and UPI national champion Minnesota in the 1961 Rose Bowl. In that era, the final wire service polls were taken at the end of the regular season.

The 1991 team finished No. 1 in the Coaches Poll and earned The Coaches&#x27; Trophy as well as the NFF MacArthur Bowl and the FWAA Grantland Rice Trophy. The title was split, with the AP Poll selecting Miami (FL).

In addition to their claimed titles, NCAA-designated &quot;major selectors&quot; also selected Washington for 1984 and 1990.

=== Rowing ===

=== Other ===

Washington won 7 National Rifle Association intercollegiate team championships prior to the introduction of the NCAA Rifle Championship in 1980.

The Huskies won the 1940–1942 intercollegiate championship ski meets held at Sun Valley, Idaho, prior to the first NCAA Skiing Championship in 1954.

== Nickname and mascot ==

In the university&#x27;s early history, Washington athletic teams were unnamed. Local sportswriters dubbed the varsity teams the &quot;Vikings&quot;, &quot;Indians&quot;, &quot;Cougars&quot;, and other names in their headlines.

===Sun Dodgers===

On January 28, 1920, the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) chose the Sun Dodgers as the official nickname of varsity athletic teams at the university. The name ranked first from a list of names submitted to the 3,233 voters.

The Sun Dodgers nickname was suggested by students and sportswriters in November 1919 before coming up for the vote. The name was derived from &quot;Sun Dodger&quot;, a campus humor magazine published by the students, and as a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the city of Seattle&#x27;s rainy weather.

The Sun Dodgers were represented by the mascot Sunny Boy, a 3.5 foot gold-painted wooden statue of a Washington undergraduate standing in front of the university&#x27;s four columns. After being stolen from a fraternity trophy room and missing for decades, Sunny Boy was rediscovered in South Bend and returned to the Huskies prior to the 1948 game versus Notre Dame.

Seattle newspapers ran joint editorials on December 25, 1921, calling for the retirement of &quot;Sun Dodgers&quot; and proposing &quot;Vikings&quot; as a new nickname for Washington&#x27;s athletic teams.
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote that Sun Dodgers &quot;lacks punch&quot; and that &quot;nobody knows what it means, anyway.&quot; The new name was said to be supported by head football coach Enoch Bagshaw and professor Edmond S. Meany, among other coaches, athletes, and administrators. The newspapers immediately began using &quot;Vikings&quot; in their headlines.

Upon returning to campus following Christmas vacation, students were surprised to learn that their teams had been renamed without consultation. &quot;Vikings&quot; was quickly abandoned. With &quot;Sun Dodgers&quot; having been found unsuitable, a joint committee of students, coaches, faculty, alumni, and businessmen was assembled in order to choose a permanent name for the university&#x27;s athletic teams.

===Huskies===

UW teams were first introduced as the Huskies on February 3, 1922, during the halftime intermission of a basketball game vs. Washington State. The newly christened Huskies beat the Cougars, who adopted their nickname in 1919, by a score of 40–10.

The &quot;Husky&quot; nickname was the selection of the committee formed to replace &quot;Sun Dodger&quot;. Other suggested names considered by the committee were &quot;Wolves&quot;, &quot;Malamutes&quot;, &quot;Tyees&quot;, &quot;Vikings&quot;, &quot;Northmen&quot;, and &quot;Olympics&quot;.

The Husky was likely chosen due to its relative ease to draw, short name for use in newspapers at the time, and it represented the ferocity of the athletic program. The ASUW felt that The Husky was a true representation of the Seattle area because many viewed Seattle as the &quot;Gateway to the Alaskan frontier&quot;, a phrase dating back to the Alaskan Gold Rush.

====Live mascot====

Dubs (first of his name) became the Husky mascot in 2009. He is an Alaskan Malamute from Burlington, Washington and was born in November 2008. Following tradition, an online vote was conducted at GoHuskies.com for the name. With more than 20,000 votes cast, &quot;Dubs II&quot; was chosen.

Dubs II was officially unveiled as Dubs&#x27; successor on March 23, 2018 (National Puppy Day). He had been selected from a group of 90 puppies to become the 14th live mascot for the University of Washington. Dubs continued to fill in as mascot during the 2018 season, with his final performance leading the team out of the tunnel during Senior Day 2018 (though he later reappeared in a home game against the Oregon Ducks in 2019). Dubs II took over at halftime leading the football team out against the Oregon State Beavers.

Dubs II is present before every home Husky football game.

<text>Bramhope is a village and civil parish in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, West Yorkshire, England, north of Holt Park and north east of Cookridge.

The village is north of Leeds city centre and it is in the LS16 Leeds postcode area. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 3,400. The population had increased to 3,533 at the 2011 Census. It is predominantly made up of large, privately owned houses which tend to be above the average value for properties in West Yorkshire.

Bramhope sits in the Leeds North West constituency and the Adel &amp; Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Bramhope&quot; appears first in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Brahop&quot; and &quot;Bramhop&quot;, with later medieval spellings including &quot;Bramhop(a)&quot; and &quot;Bramhop(p)e&quot;. The name seems to derive from the Old English words &quot;brōm&quot; &#x27;broom&#x27; and &quot;hōp&quot; &#x27;a small valley, side-valley off a larger valley&#x27;, here referring to a small valley off Wharfedale, probably the one through which flows Bramhope Beck.

== History ==

The earliest known settlement in the area was a British camp established off Moor Road. The Romans built a road through the area from Adel to Ilkley, traces of which remain in a field near Leeds Bradford Airport.

In 1086, Bramhope was the manor of an Anglo-Saxon thegn, Uchill. In 1095 the manor passed to the Percy family, and in 1165 was sold to Ralph de Bramhope. In the 13th century the monasteries owned much of the land and had granges where sheep were grazed. The monks used tracks, such as Scotland Lane and Staircase Lane, as they travelled from their outlying granges to Kirkstall Abbey.

The village had a small population until the 20th century. The Black Death of 1348-49 reduced the number of adults to 34, but this gradually increased to about 400 in 1900. Now it is approximately 3,400. Water was drawn from private wells or the town well at the foot of Northgate (now Church Hill). The town well was restored in 1991 by the Bramhope History Group, and is located opposite St Giles&#x27; Church. The plaque says that the well was exposed in 1991, so perhaps it had been lost for some time.

== Churches ==

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries Henry VIII gave the land to the Earl of Cumberland. In the 16th century the Dyneley family moved into the area and acquired Bramhope Hall. In 1649 they built the Puritan Chapel, which was taken over by the Church of England after the Restoration. The chapel is one of only a few built during the Commonwealth period. It is said not to have been consecrated but nevertheless was regularly used for church services until 1881–82. The Puritan Chapel was listed Grade I in 1966.

When the chapel proved too small for the growing population, St Giles&#x27; Church was built in 1881. The original Methodist chapel was built in 1837 and replaced by the much bigger church in 1896. There is a map showing the location of St Giles and the Methodist church here. Bramhope Cemetery, established in 1861, is in Moor Road, but there are still some historical gravestones remaining in the cemetery of the Puritan Chapel.
== Road and railway ==

For many centuries travellers to the market towns in the vicinity used Otley Old Road. However, it was the Leeds to Otley turnpike road, with its tollhouses, opened in 1842, which routed travellers through the outskirts of Bramhope. It is along this route that motorists today travel between Leeds and the northwest. The milestones along the road were erected in 1850.

The railway was excavated under the village through the Bramhope Tunnel constructed between 1845 and 1849. The tunnel has an elaborate castellated northern entrance and there are many heaps of spoil and several ventilation shafts along its length. There is a replica of the tunnel entrance in Otley churchyard, erected as a memorial to the 24 men who lost their lives during the tunnel&#x27;s construction. A railway station has never been built at or near Bramhope.

== Schools ==
A village school was built in Eastgate where the war memorial garden is situated. A plaque states &quot;On this site in 1790 a Day School was erected by the freeholders and copyholders of Bramhope Township. It was also used as a Sunday School and Public Meeting Place. Demolished 1961&quot;. The school became overcrowded whilst tunnelling work for the railway was going on in the late 1840s. It was replaced by a larger building in 1873 in Breary Lane, next to the shopping parade. The present school, situated on Tredgold Crescent, was opened in 1961.

== Community ==

Bramhope has a Round Table, which organises activities to raise money for charity. Bramhope has a cricket club which plays at the Recreation Ground on Old Lane. The club plays in the Leeds and Wetherby Cricket League and has two senior teams.

=== Memorial Hall ===
Robert Craven Memorial Hall (originally the Craven Institute, 1896) was part of the bequest of Robert Craven, a local farmer. It is now the village hall and administered as a registered charity. It has a crown bowling green, car park and tennis courts. Inside there are various rooms plus a large hall with stage, which doubles as a badminton court. On the second Saturday of every month a farmer&#x27;s market is hosted at this hall. The memorial hall also hosts a yearly flower show in the autumn, and a bridge club.

===Bramhope Scout Campsite===
The 13-acre Bramhope Scout Campsite, to the west of the village, is owned by Central Yorkshire Scouts.

<text>The Zeeland Bridge () is the longest bridge in the Netherlands. The bridge spans the Eastern Scheldt estuary. It connects the islands of Schouwen-Duiveland and Noord-Beveland in the province of Zeeland.

The Zeeland Bridge was built between 1963 and 1965. It was inaugurated on 15 December 1965 by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, and was originally called Eastern Scheldt Bridge () before being renamed the Zealand Bridge on 13 April 1967. At the time of its completion, it was the longest bridge in Europe. It has a total length of 5,022 metres, and consists of 48 spans of 95 metres, 2 spans of 72.5 metres and a movable bridge with a width of 40 metres.

The province of Zeeland borrowed the money for the construction of the bridge. The loan was repaid by levying tolls for the first 24 years.

<doc id="994484" wikidata="Q15086" url="?curid=994484" title="NGC 2362">
<text>NGC 2362, also known as Caldwell 64, is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of Canis Major. It was discovered by the Italian court astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna, who published his finding in 1654. William Herschel called it a &quot;beautiful cluster&quot;, while William Henry Smyth said it &quot;has a beautiful appearance, the bright white star being surrounded by a rich gathering of minute companions, in a slightly elongated form, and nearly vertical position&quot;. In the past it has also been listed as a nebula, but in 1930 Robert J. Trumpler found no evidence of nebulosity. The brightest member star system is Tau Canis Majoris, and therefore it is sometimes called the Tau Canis Majoris Cluster.

The cluster is located at a distance of approximately 1.48 kpc from the Sun, and appears associated with the giant nebula Sh2-310 that lies at the same distance, about one degree to the east. This giant H II region is being ionized by the brighter members of the NGC 2362 cluster.

NGC 2362 is a relatively young 4–5 million years in age but is devoid of star-forming gas and dust, indicating that the star formation process has come to a halt. It is a massive open cluster, with more than 500 solar masses, an estimated 100-150 member stars, and an additional 500 forming a halo around the cluster. Of these cluster members, only around 35 show evidence of a debris disk. There is one slightly evolved O-type star, Tau Canis Majoris, and around 40 B-type stars still on the main sequence. Only one candidate classical Be star has been found, as of 2005.

<doc id="994488" wikidata="Q841667" url="?curid=994488" title="Neutral Ground (Louisiana)">
<text>The Neutral Ground (also known as the Neutral Strip, the Neutral Territory, and the [[No Man&#x27;s Land]] of Louisiana; sometimes anachronistically referred to as the Sabine Free State) was a disputed area between Spanish Texas and the United States&#x27; newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. Local officers of Spain and the United States agreed to leave the Neutral Ground temporarily outside the jurisdiction of either country. The area, now in western Louisiana, had neutral status from 1806 to 1821.

== Background ==
Spain had been concerned for many years with what it viewed as the encroachment of the French from Louisiana into Texas. About 1734, the French moved their post at Natchitoches from the east to the west side of the Red River. The Spanish governor of Texas, Manuel de Sandoval, was reprimanded for not protesting this violation of what Spain believed was its sovereign territory. In 1740, Governor Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra was ordered to investigate French intrusion in the Natchitoches area. Other investigations were ordered in 1744 and 1751.

In 1753, Texas Governor Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui determined that the French had encroached on Texas by occupying territory to the west of Arroyo Hondo, a small creek in western Natchitoches Parish that had previously been used by the French as their western boundary with Texas. In 1764, the boundary dispute became temporarily moot when France ceded its Louisiana colony to Spain. This colony was the large area west of the Mississippi River but drained by the same, plus New Orleans and its immediate vicinity. The transfer was made without resolving the earlier border dispute, which did not seem significant under the circumstances. Spain administered the area from Havana, contracting out governing to people from many nationalities as long as they swore allegiance to Spain and promised to publicly worship in Catholic churches. Many Americans took advantage of these grants that would eventually become known as Rio Hondo claims.

By the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Louisiana was formally transferred back to France, although the Spanish continued to administer it. The terms of the treaty did not specify the boundaries of the territory being returned. Rumors of the treaty reached U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, who sought to purchase land at the mouth of the Mississippi to ensure American access to the Gulf of Mexico. Jefferson discovered that Napoleon was willing to sell the entire territory to help fund his wars in Europe. France took formal control of Louisiana from Spain on November 30, 1803, and turned over New Orleans to the United States on December 20, 1803. The U.S. took over the rest of the territory on March 10, 1804. The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States and opened U.S. expansion west to the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf Coast.

== The boundary dispute between Spain and the United States ==
The precise boundaries of the area had still not been determined. The United States, having purchased the territory from France, claimed the same boundaries France had claimed before the transfer to Spain. In fact, the U.S. asserted a claim to the Rio Grande as the western border, based on the temporary settlement by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in Texas in 1684. The more serious U.S. claim, however, was to the Sabine River, today&#x27;s boundary between the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas. Spanish claims were the same as before — to the Arroyo Hondo in Natchitoches Parish and, south of the Kisatchie Hills, to the Calcasieu River.

Negotiations to resolve the dispute broke down in 1805 when Spain severed diplomatic relations with the United States. From October 1805 until October 1806, there was continual skirmishing, both verbal and military, around the Sabine River. There were rumors that both sides were amassing troops near the disputed area.

=== Establishment of the Neutral Ground ===
Neither side, however, wanted to go to war over the dispute. In order to avert further armed clashes, U.S. General James Wilkinson and Spanish Lt. Col. Simón de Herrera, the two military commanders in the region, signed an agreement declaring the disputed territory Neutral Ground (November 5, 1806), until the boundary could be determined by the respective governments. The agreement was not a treaty and was not ratified by either government, although it was largely respected. Even with this agreement, the boundaries of the Neutral Ground were not entirely specified.

The Arroyo Hondo and (unconnected) Calcasieu River were the eastern boundary, with the Sabine River serving as the western boundary. The southern boundary was undoubtedly the Gulf of Mexico, and it can be assumed that the northern boundary was the thirty-second parallel, approximately. It included portions of the present-day Louisiana parishes of De Soto, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon, Rapides, Beauregard, Allen, Calcasieu, Jefferson Davis, and Cameron.

The area covered by the agreement was declared off-limits to soldiers of both countries. The agreement also stipulated that no settlers would be permitted in the Neutral Ground. Nevertheless, settlers from New Spain and the United States territory began to move in. After the area was recognized as a part of the United States, these settlers were granted third class homestead claims. (Those with Spanish land grants predating the sale of the Louisiana Purchase to the United States were granted first class claims.) Some of the settlers from the United States would form the nucleus of the Louisiana Redbone community. This lawless area also attracted exiles, deserters, political refugees, fortune hunters, and a variety of criminals. Eventually, the highwaymen organized to the degree that they manned outposts and organized spies in order to better fleece travelers and avoid the American and Spanish military. In 1810, and again in 1812, the two governments sent joint military expeditions into the area to expel outlaws.

== Resolution and afterward ==
The Adams–Onís Treaty, signed in 1819 and ratified in 1821, recognized the U.S. claim, setting the border at the Sabine River. Spain surrendered any claim to the area. (Two years after the treaty was negotiated, New Spain won its independence as the Mexican Empire.) After the treaty, however, the Neutral Ground and the adjacent part of East Texas remained in the hands of the Spanish. The Regulator–Moderator War in East Texas in 1839–44 had its roots in the earlier anarchy of the Neutral Ground.

<text>Pomfrets are scombriform fish belonging to the family Bramidae. The family currently includes 20 species across seven genera. Several species are important food sources for humans, especially &quot;Brama brama&quot; in South Asia. The earlier form of the pomfret&#x27;s name was &quot;&quot;, a word which probably ultimately comes from Portuguese &quot;pampo&quot;, referring to various fish such as the blue butterfish (&quot;Stromateus fiatola&quot;). The fish meat is white in color.

==Distribution==

They are found globally in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as numerous seas including the Norwegian, Mediterranean, and Sea of Japan. Nearly all species can be found in the high seas. However, fish in the genera &quot;Pterycombus&quot; and &quot;Pteraclis&quot; tend to be found off continental shelves. Further, fishes in the genus &quot;Eumegistus&quot; are hypothesized to be largely benthic and found to occupy deep water shelves.

Some species of pomfrets are also known as monchong, specifically in Hawaiian cuisine.

==Genera==
The following genera are placed within the family Bramidae:

* &quot;Brama&quot; 
* &quot;Eumegistus&quot; 
* &quot;Pteraclis&quot; 
* &quot;Pterycombus&quot; 
* &quot;Taractes&quot; 
* &quot;Taractichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Xenobrama&quot; 
The following fossil genera are also known:

* ?†&quot;Bramoides&quot; 
* ?†&quot;Goniocranion&quot; (possibly a lampriform)
* †&quot;Paucaichthys&quot; 

The fossil genus &quot;Digoria&quot; was also previously placed with the Bramidae, but is now known to be a beardfish.

<text>IrfanView () is an image viewer, editor, organiser and converter program for Microsoft Windows. It can also play video and audio files, and has some image creation and painting capabilities. IrfanView is free for non-commercial use; commercial use requires paid registration. It is noted for its small size, speed, ease of use, and ability to handle a wide variety of graphic file formats. It was first released in 1996.

IrfanView is named after its creator, Irfan Škiljan, from Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina, living in Vienna. The current version of IrfanView, 4.70, works under all versions of Windows from Windows XP to Windows 11. Version 4.44 and older versions were compatible with Windows 95/98/Me and can also be run in Linux under Wine and in macOS using WineBottler. 

==Features==
IrfanView is specifically optimized for fast image display and loading times. It supports viewing and saving of numerous file types including image formats such as BMP, GIF, JPEG, JP2 &amp; JPM (JPEG2000), PNG (includes the optimizer OptiPNG; APNG can be read), TIFF, raw photo formats from digital cameras, ECW (Enhanced Compressed Wavelet), EMF (Enhanced Windows Metafile), FSH (EA Sports format), ICO (Windows icon), PCX (Zsoft Paintbrush), PBM (Portable BitMap), PDF (Portable Document Format), PGM (Portable GrayMap), PPM (Portable PixelMap), TGA (Truevision Targa), WebP, FLIF (Free Lossless Image Format) and viewing of media files such as Flash, Ogg, Vorbis, MPEG, MP3, MIDI, and text files.

Image editing includes crop, resize, and rotate. Images can be adjusted by modifying their brightness, contrast, tint, and gamma level manually or automatically, and by converting them between file formats. Many of these changes can be applied to multiple images in one operation using batch processing.

A plugin allows IrfanView to support lossless JPG operations: horizontal or vertical flip, rotation by 90° increments, and cropping.

===Plugins===
IrfanView uses plugins to handle several additional images, video, and sound formats and to add optional functionality such as filter processing or other program features. With its diverse set of format plugins, the program has been recommended for viewing obscure image formats, or corrupted files, which commercial photo editing software cannot read.

===Search engine toolbar===
Prior to version 4.41 installer versions of IrfanView supported a number of browser toolbars. Version 4.40 optionally installed the Amazon 1Button App (formerly the Amazon Browser bar).

==Reception==
Irfanview has been positively reviewed as &quot;really good&quot; for easily and rapidly viewing and manipulating images, with its editing and drawing tools. Other writers have focused on its ability to open a wide variety of image formats. In a series of image quality tests conducted in 2004, compared with commercial image compressors and Adobe Photoshop 7, Irfanview 3.91 produced &quot;consistently better images than the Adobe Photoshop JPEG encoder at the same data rate&quot;, and its JPEG2000 compression quality &quot;closely followed&quot; the best codec, JasPer.&quot; According to IrfanView&#x27;s official website, since 2003, IrfanView has been downloaded over 1 million times per month. One independent review in 2017 described Irfanview, as &quot;the Swiss Army Knife of image viewers&quot;.

==Author==
Irfan Škiljan graduated from the Vienna University of Technology. In a 2006 interview, then 32-year-old Škiljan said that he was able to more or less live off the software, generating income with the sale of licenses for commercial users and of special versions for different customers.

=== Pronunciation ===
The author claims that the software is pronounced as &quot;EarfanView&quot;; it is named after himself and is an Islamic Arabic name, Irfan.

===Logo/mascot===
According to Škiljan, the IrfanView logo and mascot is a &quot;road cat&quot; (there is a tire track across the smallest and the biggest icon for Windows Explorer, as well as the version for Microsoft Store) but that he &quot;likes cats&quot;, and the icon is &quot;a joke&quot; – the IrfanView website pictures him holding a white domestic cat.

<text>Horacio Silvestre Quiroga Forteza (31 December 1878 – 19 February 1937) was a Uruguayan playwright, poet, and short story writer.

He wrote stories which, in their jungle settings, used the supernatural and the bizarre to show the struggle of man and animal to survive. He also excelled in portraying mental illness and hallucinatory states, a skill he gleaned from Edgar Allan Poe, according to some critics. Quiroga&#x27;s work influenced Gabriel García Márquez and Julio Cortázar.

== Biography ==
===Youth===
Horacio Quiroga was born in the city of Salto in 1878 as the sixth child and second son of Prudencio Quiroga and Pastora Forteza, a middle-class family. At the time of his birth, his father had been working for 18 years as head of the Argentine vice-consulate. Before Quiroga was two and a half months old, on 14 March 1879, his father accidentally fired a gun he was carrying in his hands and died as a result. Quiroga was baptized three months later in the parish church of his native town.

===Development===

Quiroga finished school in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. He studied at the National College and also attended the Polytechnic Institute of Montevideo for technical training. From a very young age, he showed great interest in a variety of subjects and activities including literature, chemistry, photography, mechanics, cycling and country life. Around this time he founded the Salto Cycling Club and achieved the remarkable feat of cycling from his home town to Paysandú, a distance of 120 kilometres (74½ miles)

It was also around this time that he worked in a machinery repair shop; under the influence of the owner&#x27;s son he became interested in philosophy, describing himself as a &quot;forthright and passionate foot soldier of materialism.&quot;

At the age of 22, Quiroga became interested in poetry, discovering the work of Leopoldo Lugones, with whom he would later become great friends, and of Edgar Allan Poe. This led him to dabble in various forms and styles of poetic expression himself: post-romanticism, symbolism and &quot;modernismo&quot;. He soon began to publish his poems in his home town. While studying and working, he collaborated with publications such as &quot;La Revista&quot; and &quot;La Reforma&quot;, improving his style and making a name for himself.

During the Carnival of 1898, the young poet met his first love, a girl named Mary Esther Jurkovski, who would inspire two of his most important works: &quot;Las sacrificadas&quot; (1920; &quot;The Slaughtered&quot;) and &quot;Una estación de amor&quot; (1912; &quot;A Season of Love&quot;). However, the young girl&#x27;s Jewish parents disapproved of the relationship on the grounds that Quiroga was a Gentile, and the couple were forced to separate.

In his home town, he founded a magazine titled &quot;Revista de Salto&quot; (1899). In the same year, his stepfather committed suicide by shooting himself; Quiroga witnessed the death. With the money he received as inheritance he embarked on a four-month trip to Paris, which turned out to be a failure: he returned to Uruguay hungry and disheartened.

===Early career===
On his return Quiroga gathered together his friends Federico Ferrando, Alberto Brignole, Julio Jaureche, Fernández Saldaña, José Hasda and Asdrúbal Delgado, and with them founded the &quot;Consistorio del Gay Saber&quot; (&quot;The Consistory of The Gay Science&quot;), a literary laboratory for their experimental writing, in which they found new ways to express themselves and their modernist goals. In 1901 Quiroga published his first book, &quot;Los Arrecifes de Coral&quot; (&quot;Coral Reefs&quot;), but the achievement was overshadowed by the deaths of two of his siblings, Prudencio and Pastora, who were victims of typhoid fever in Chaco Province. That fateful year held yet another shocking event in store for Quiroga. His friend Federico Ferrando had received bad reviews from Germán Papini, a Montevideo journalist, and challenged him to a duel. Quiroga, anxious about his friend&#x27;s safety, offered to check and clean the gun that was to be used. While inspecting the weapon, he accidentally fired off a shot that hit Ferrando in the mouth, killing him instantly. When the police arrived, Quiroga was arrested, interrogated and transferred to a correctional prison. The police investigated the circumstances of the homicide and deemed Ferrando&#x27;s death an accident; Quiroga was released after four days&#x27; detention. He was eventually exonerated of blame.

Racked with grief and guilt over the death of his beloved friend, Quiroga dissolved The Consistory and moved from Uruguay to Argentina. He crossed the Río de la Plata in 1902 and went to live with María, one of his sisters. In Buenos Aires Quiroga the artist reached professional maturity, which would come to full fruition during his stays in the jungle. His sister&#x27;s husband also introduced him to pedagogy and found him work as a teacher under contract to the board of examination for the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He was appointed professor of Spanish at the British School of Buenos Aires in March 1903.

In June of that year Quiroga, already an experienced photographer, accompanied Leopoldo Lugones on an expedition, funded by the Argentine Ministry of Education, in which the famous Argentine poet planned to investigate some ruins of Jesuit missions in the Misiones Province. The jungle of Misiones left a profound impression on Quiroga that marked his life forever: he spent six months and the last of his inheritance (seven thousand pesos) on some land for cotton in Chaco Province, located seven kilometers from Resistencia, next to the Saladito River. The project failed, due to problems with his aboriginal workers, but Quiroga&#x27;s life was enriched by experiencing life as a countryman for the first time. His narrative benefited from his new knowledge of country people and rural culture; this permanently changed his style.
Upon returning to Buenos Aires after his failed experience in the Chaco, Quiroga embraced the short story with passion and energy. In 1904 he published a book of stories called &quot;The Crime of Another&quot;, which was heavily influenced by the style of Edgar Allan Poe. Quiroga did not mind these early comparisons with Poe, and until the end of his life, he would often say that Poe was his first and principal teacher.

Quiroga worked for the next two years on a multitude of stories, many were about rural terror, but others were delightful stories for children. During this time he wrote the magnificent horror story, &quot;The Feather Pillow&quot;. It was published in 1917 by a famous magazine in Argentina, &quot;Caras y Caretas&quot; (&quot;Faces and Masks&quot;), which went on to publish eight of his other stories that year. Shortly after it was published, Quiroga became famous and his writings were eagerly sought by thousands of readers.

===First marriage===
In 1906 Quiroga decided to return to his beloved jungle. Taking advantage of the fact that the government wanted the land to be used, Quiroga bought a farm (with Vincent Gozalbo) of in the province of Misiones, on the banks of the Upper Parana, and began making preparations, while teaching Castilian and Literature nearby. He moved in during the winter of 1908.

Quiroga fell in love with one of his teenage students, Ana María Cires, to whom he would dedicate his first novel, entitled &quot; History of a Troubled Love&quot;. Quiroga insisted on the relationship despite the opposition of her parents, eventually garnering their permission to marry her and take her to live in the jungle with him. Quiroga&#x27;s parents-in-law were concerned about the risks of living in Misiones, a wild region, and that is why they decided to join their daughter and son-in-law, and live close by in order to help them. So, Ana María&#x27;s parents and a friend of her mother moved into a house near Quiroga.

In 1911, Ana María gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, at their home in the jungle; they named her Eglé Quiroga. During the same year, the writer began farming in partnership with his friend, fellow Uruguayan Vicente Gozalbo, and he was also appointed justice of the peace in the civil registry of San Ignacio. This job was not the best fit for Quiroga who, forgetful, disorganized and careless, took to the habit of jotting down deaths, marriages and births on small pieces of paper and &quot;archiving&quot; them in a cookie tin. Later, a character in one of his stories was given a similar trait.

The following year Ana María gave birth to a son, named Darío. Quiroga decided, as soon as the children could walk, that he would personally take care of their upbringing. Stern and dictatorial, Quiroga demanded that every little detail be done according to his requirements. From a young age, he got his children used to the mountains and the jungle. Quiroga exposed them to danger so that they would be able to cope alone and overcome any situation. He even went so far as to leave them alone at night in the jungle, or make them sit on the edge of a cliff with their legs dangling into the void. His daughter learned to breed wild animals and the son to use a shotgun, ride a motorbike and travel alone in a canoe. Quiroga&#x27;s children never objected to these experiences and actually benefited from them. Their mother, however, was terrified and exasperated by her husband&#x27;s eccentric ways. Elements of this upbringing appear in his short story, &quot;Hijo,&quot; (&quot;Son&quot;) written in 1935 and included in his collection &quot;Más allá&quot;.

Between 1912 and 1915 the writer, who already had experience as a cotton farmer and herbalist, undertook a bold pursuit to increase the farming and maximize the natural resources of their lands. He began to distill oranges and produce coal and resins, as well as many other similar activities. Meanwhile, he raised livestock, domesticated wild animals, hunted, and fished. Literature continued to be the peak of his life: in the journal &quot;Fray Mocho de Buenos Aires&quot; Quiroga published numerous stories, many set in the jungle and populated by characters so naturalistic that they seemed real.

But Quiroga&#x27;s wife was not happy: although she had become well-adapted to life in the jungle, the relationship between her and her husband was fraught with discord. Clashes between the couple occurred frequently, and although the cause was usually trivial, their excessive arguments became daily setbacks. These incidences, accentuated by Quiroga&#x27;s volatile nature, disturbed his wife so greatly that she became depressed. After a violent fight with Quiroga, Ana María ingested a fatal dose of the mercury dichloride that Quiroga used for his photography. The poison did not kill her instantly; she died on 14 December 1915.

===Buenos Aires===
After Ana María&#x27;s death, Quiroga left for Buenos Aires with his children where he became an under-secretary general accountant at the Uruguayan Consulate, thanks to the efforts of some of his friends who wanted to help. Throughout the year 1917, Quiroga lived in a basement with his children on Avenue Canning, alternating his diplomatic work with setting up a home office and working on many stories, which were being published in prestigious magazines. Quiroga collected most of the stories in several books, the first was &quot; Tales of Love, Madness and Death &quot; (1917). Manuel Galvez, owner of a publishing firm, had suggested that he write it and the volume immediately became a huge success with audiences and critics, consolidating Quiroga as the true master of the Latin American short story.

The following year he settled in a small apartment on Calle Agüero, while he published &quot;Jungle Tales&quot; (1918, a collection of children&#x27;s stories featuring animals and set in the Misiones rainforest). Quiroga dedicated this book to his children, who accompanied him during that rough period of poverty in the damp basement.

In 1919, Quiroga was twice promoted in the consular ranks. He also had published his latest collection of stories, &quot;The Wild&quot;. The next year, following the idea of &quot;The Consistory&quot;, Quiroga founded the Anaconda Association, a group of intellectuals involved in cultural activities in Argentina and Uruguay. His only play, &quot; The Slaughtered&quot;, was published in 1920 and was released in 1921, when &quot; Anaconda&quot; was release, another book of short stories. An important Argentine newspaper, &quot;La Nación&quot; (The Nation), also began to publish his stories, which by now already enjoyed impressive popularity. Between 1922 and 1924, Quiroga served as secretary of a cultural embassy to Brazil and he published his new book: &quot; The Desert &quot; (stories). He worked as a film critic for a time and also wrote the screenplay for a feature film, &quot;The Florida Raft&quot;, that was never realized. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to form a school of cinematography by Soviet investors, but it was unsuccessful.

===Second marriage===

Quiroga then returned to Misiones. He was in love again, this time with a 22-year-old Ana María Palacio. He tried to persuade her parents to let her go to live in the jungle with him. Palacio&#x27;s parents&#x27; unrelenting rejection of this idea and the consequent failure of the relationship inspired the theme of his second novel, &quot; Past love&quot; (published later, in 1929). The novel contains autobiographical elements of the strategies he used himself to pursue Palacio, such as leaving messages in a hollowed branch, sending letters written in code and trying to dig a long tunnel to her room with thoughts of kidnapping her. Finally, the parents grew tired of Quiroga&#x27;s attempts and took her away so he was forced to renounce his love.

In the workshop in his house, he built a boat he christened &quot;Gaviota&quot;. His home was on the water and he used the boat to go from San Ignacio downriver to Buenos Aires and on numerous river expeditions.

In early 1926, Quiroga returned to Buenos Aires and rented a villa in a suburban area. At the height of his popularity, a major publisher honored him, along with other literary figures of the time such as Arturo Capdevila, Baldomero Fernandez Moreno, Benito Lynch, Juana de Ibarbourou, Armando Donoso and Luis Franco.

A lover of classical music, Quiroga often attended the concerts of the Wagner Association. He also tirelessly read technical texts, manuals on mechanics, and books on arts and physics.

In 1927, Quiroga decided to raise and domesticate wild animals, while publishing his new book of short stories, &quot; Exiles&quot;. But the amorous artist had already set his eyes on what would be his last love: María Elena Bravo, a classmate of his daughter Eglé, who married him that year, not even 20 years old (He was 49).

===Return to Misiones===
In 1932 Quiroga again settled in Misiones, where he would retire, with his wife and third daughter (María Elena, called Pitoca, who was born in 1928). To do this, he got a decree transferring his consular office to a nearby city. He was devoted to living quietly in the jungle with his wife and daughter.

Due to a change of government, his services were declined and he was expelled from the consulate. To exacerbate Quiroga&#x27;s problems, his wife did not like living in the jungle, so fighting and violent discussions became a daily occurrence.

In this time of frustration and pain he published a collection of short stories titled &quot;Beyond&quot; (1935). From his interest in the work of Munthe and Ibsen, Quiroga began reading new authors and styles and began planning his autobiography.

===Decline and death===
In 1935 Quiroga began to experience prostate problems. He heeded his wife&#x27;s advice and consulted doctors in Posadas, who diagnosed him with prostate hypertrophy.

Quiroga separated from his second wife, who left along with their youngest daughter back to Buenos Aires. Worsening health prompted Quiroga to travel to Buenos Aires for medical treatment. In 1937, he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. María Elena and his large group of friends came to comfort him.

When Quiroga was in the emergency ward, he had learned that a patient was shut up in the basement with hideous deformities similar to those of Joseph Merrick. Taking pity, Quiroga demanded that the patient, named Vicent Batistessa, be released from confinement and moved into his room. Batistessa was grateful and befriended the writer.

Quiroga disclosed his plan to commit suicide to Batistessa, who offered to help. On the morning of 19 February 1937, Horacio Quiroga drank a glass of cyanide that killed him within minutes. His body was buried in the grounds of the &quot;Casa del Teatro de la Sociedad Argentina de Escritores&quot; (SADE), of which he was the founder and vice-president, although his remains were later repatriated to his homeland.

== Work and influences==

As a follower of the &quot;modernista&quot; school founded by Rubén Darío, as well as admirer of Edgar Allan Poe and Guy de Maupassant, Quiroga was attracted to topics covering the most intriguing aspects of nature, often tinged with horror, disease, insanity and human suffering. Many of his stories belong to this movement, embodied in his work &quot;Tales of Love, Madness and Death&quot;.

Quiroga was also inspired by British writer Rudyard Kipling (&quot;The Jungle Book&quot;), which is shown in his own &quot;Jungle Tales&quot;.

His &quot;Décalogo del Perfecto Cuentista&quot; (Ten Commandments for the Perfect Storyteller), dedicated to young writers, provides certain contradictions with his own work. While the Decalogue touts an economic and precise style, using few adjectives, natural and simple wording, and clarity of expression, in many of his own stories Quiroga did not follow his own principles, using ornate language, with plenty of adjectives and at times ostentatious vocabulary.

==Legacy==
A species of South American snake, &quot;Apostolepis quirogai&quot;, is named in his honor.

<doc id="994499" wikidata="Q773403" url="?curid=994499" title="No man's land">
<text>No man&#x27;s land is waste or unowned land or an uninhabited or desolate area that may be under dispute between parties who leave it unoccupied out of fear or uncertainty. The term was originally used to define a contested territory or a dumping ground for refuse between fiefdoms. It is commonly associated with World War I to describe the area of land between two enemy trench systems, not controlled by either side. The term is also used metaphorically, to refer to an ambiguous, anomalous, or indefinite area, regarding an application, situation, or jurisdiction. It has sometimes been used to name a specific place.

== Origin ==
According to Alasdair Pinkerton, an expert in human geography at Royal Holloway, University of London, the term is first mentioned in Domesday Book (1086), to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; contains a reference to the term dating back to 1320, spelled &quot;nonesmanneslond&quot;, to describe a territory that was disputed or involved in a legal disagreement. The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of London that was assigned as the place of execution. The term is also applied in nautical use to a space amidships, originally between the forecastle and the booms in a square-rigged vessel where various ropes, tackle, block, and other supplies were stored. In the United Kingdom, several places called No Man&#x27;s Land denoted &quot;extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king … ribbons of land between these different regimes of power&quot;.

==Examples==
=== World War I ===
The British Army did not widely employ the term when the Regular Army arrived in France in August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War I. The terms used most frequently at the start of the war to describe the area between the trench lines included &#x27;between the trenches&#x27; or &#x27;between the lines&#x27;. The term &#x27;no man&#x27;s land&#x27; was first used in a military context by soldier and historian Ernest Swinton in his short story &quot;The Point of View&quot;. Swinton used the term in war correspondence on the Western Front, with specific mention of the terms concerning to the Race to the Sea in late 1914. The Anglo-German Christmas truce of 1914 brought the term into common use, and thereafter it appeared frequently in official communiqués, newspaper reports, and personnel correspondences of the members of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).

In World War I, no man&#x27;s land often ranged from several hundred yards to less than , in some cases. Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often extensively cratered by exploded shells, riddled with barbed wire, and littered with rudimentary land mines; as well as the corpses and wounded soldiers who were unable to make it through the hailstorm of projectiles, explosions, and flames. The area was sometimes contaminated by chemical weapons. It was open to fire from the opposing trenches and hard going generally slowed any attempted advance. 

Not only were soldiers forced to cross no man&#x27;s land when advancing, and as the case might be when retreating, but after an attack the stretcher-bearers had to enter it to bring in the wounded. No man&#x27;s land remained a regular feature of the battlefield until near the end of World War I when mechanised weapons (i.e., tanks and airplanes) made entrenched lines less of an obstacle.

Effects from World War I no man&#x27;s lands persist today, for example at Verdun in France, where the &quot;Zone Rouge&quot; (Red Zone) contains unexploded ordnance, and is poisoned beyond habitation by arsenic, chlorine, and phosgene gas. The zone is sealed off completely and still deemed too dangerous for civilians to return: &quot;The area is still considered to be very poisoned, so the French government planted an enormous forest of black pines, like a living sarcophagus&quot;, comments Alasdair Pinkerton, a researcher at Royal Holloway University of London, who compared the zone to the nuclear disaster site at Chernobyl, similarly encased in a &quot;concrete sarcophagus&quot;.

=== Cold War ===
During the Cold War, one example of &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; was the territory close to the Iron Curtain. Officially the territory belonged to the Eastern Bloc countries, but over the entire Iron Curtain, there were several wide tracts of uninhabited land, several hundred meters (yards) in width, containing watch towers, minefields, unexploded bombs, and other such debris. Would-be escapees from Eastern Bloc countries who successfully scaled the border fortifications could still be apprehended or shot by border guards in the zone.

The U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba is separated from Cuba proper by an area called the Cactus Curtain. In late 1961, the Cuban Army had its troops plant a barrier of &quot;Opuntia&quot; cactus along the northeastern section of the fence surrounding the base to prevent economic migrants fleeing from Cuba from resettling in the United States. This was dubbed the &quot;Cactus Curtain&quot;, an allusion to Europe&#x27;s Iron Curtain and the Bamboo Curtain in East Asia. U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 land mines across the no man&#x27;s land, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Americas. On 16 May 1996, President Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. land mines to be removed and replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders. The Cuban government has not removed the corresponding minefield on its side of the border.

=== Israel–Jordan ===

From 1949 to 1967 the border between Israel and Jordan contained a few small regions that were considered &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; because neither side had jurisdiction. The 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan were signed in Rhodes with the help of UN mediation on 3 April 1949. Armistice lines were determined in November 1948. Between the lines territory was left that was defined as no man&#x27;s land. Such areas existed in Jerusalem in the area between the western and southern parts of the Walls of Jerusalem and Musrara. A strip of land north and south of Latrun was also known as &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; because it was not controlled by either Israel or Jordan between 1948 and 1967.

The no man&#x27;s land regions were eliminated when Israel conquered them during the Six day war.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

The battle of Bakhmut, during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has been labeled as one of the bloodiest battles of the 21st century, with the battlefield being described as a &quot;meat grinder&quot; and a &quot;vortex&quot; for both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries.

With extremely high casualties, costly ground assaults with very little ground gained, and shell-pocked landscapes, volunteers, media, and government officials alike compared fighting in Bakhmut to battlefield conditions on the western front of World War I.

Retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Andrew Milburn, the leader of a foreign volunteer group in Ukraine called the Mozart Group and an eyewitness to the battle, compared conditions in the Bakhmut countryside to Passchendaele and the city itself to Dresden in World War II. On 11 January 2023, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described the fighting ongoing at Bakhmut and Soledar as the bloodiest since the start of the invasion. Comparisons have also been made between Bakhmut and the battles of Verdun, the Somme and Stalingrad by both Western and Ukrainian officials.

<doc id="994501" wikidata="Q838997" url="?curid=994501" title="List of tallest buildings in New York City">
<text>New York City, the most populous city in the United States, is home to more than 7,000 completed high-rise buildings of at least , of which at least 102 are taller than . The tallest building in New York is One World Trade Center, which rises . The 104-story skyscraper also stands as the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the seventh-tallest building in the world. At , Central Park Tower is the second-tallest completed building in the city. It has the highest roof of any building outside Asia, and is the tallest residential building in the world. The third-tallest completed building in the city is 111 West 57th Street. Rising to , it is the world&#x27;s most slender skyscraper. The fourth-tallest is One Vanderbilt. At , it is the tallest office building in Midtown. The fifth-tallest is 432 Park Avenue at .

At , the 102-story Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, which was finished in 1931, stood as the tallest building in the world from its completion until 1970, when construction on the North Tower of the original World Trade Center surpassed it. It is the tenth-tallest building in the United States, and rises to a pinnacle of including its antenna. The North Tower (the original One World Trade Center), along with its twin the South Tower (the first Two World Trade Center), which was six feet shorter, held this title only briefly as they were both surpassed by construction of the 110-story Willis Tower in Chicago in 1973. The Twin Towers remained the tallest buildings in New York City until they were destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks, leaving the Empire State Building again as the city&#x27;s tallest building.

The new One World Trade Center began construction in 2006; in April 2012 it surpassed the Empire State Building to become the city&#x27;s tallest. Upon its topping out in May 2013, the One World Trade Center surpassed the Willis Tower to become the tallest building in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. One World Trade Center is part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center, which also includes the 3 World Trade Center, the 4 World Trade Center, the 7 World Trade Center, the approved 900-foot (274 m) 5 World Trade Center, and one partly constructed on-hold building: the 2 World Trade Center.

The majority of skyscrapers in New York City are concentrated in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, although other neighborhoods of Manhattan and the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx also contain some high-rises.
, there were 317 completed skyscrapers that rose at least in height, more than any other city in the Western Hemisphere, and third most in the world exceeded only by Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

== History ==
The history of skyscrapers in New York City began with the construction of the Equitable Life, Western Union, and Tribune buildings in the early 1870s. These relatively short early skyscrapers, sometimes referred to as &quot;preskyscrapers&quot; or &quot;protoskyscrapers&quot;, included features such as a steel frame and elevators—then-new innovations that were used in the city&#x27;s later skyscrapers. Modern skyscraper construction began with the completion of the World Building in 1890; the structure rose to a pinnacle of . Though not the city&#x27;s first high-rise, it was the first building to surpass the spire of Trinity Church. The World Building, which stood as the tallest in the city until 1899, was demolished in 1955 to allow for the construction of an expanded entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Park Row Building, at , was the city&#x27;s tallest building from 1899 to 1908, and the world&#x27;s tallest office building during the same time span. By 1900, fifteen skyscrapers in New York City exceeded in height.

New York has played a prominent role in the development of the skyscraper. Since 1890, ten of those built in the city have held the title of world&#x27;s tallest. New York City went through two very early high-rise construction booms, the first of which spanned the 1890s through the 1910s, and the second from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s. During this period 44 skyscrapers over  were built—including the Singer Building, Met Life Tower, Woolworth Building, 40 Wall Street, the Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building, each of which was the tallest in the world at the time of its completion, the last remaining so for forty years.

Skyscraper construction resumed in the early 1960s, with construction surges in the early 1970s, late 1980s, and late 2010s. In total, the city has seen the rise of over 100 completed and topped-out structures at least high, including the twin towers of the World Trade Center, and the current World Trade Center redevelopment.

== Tallest buildings ==
This list ranks completed and topped out New York City skyscrapers that stand at least tall based on standard height measurements. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. An asterisk (*) indicates that the building is still under construction but has been topped out. The &quot;Year&quot; column indicates the year in which a building was completed.

=== Tallest buildings by pinnacle height ===

This list ranks buildings in New York City based on pinnacle height measurement, which includes antenna masts. Standard architectural height measurement, which excludes non-architectural antennas in building height, is included for comparative purposes. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The &quot;Year&quot; column indicates the year in which a building was completed.

=== Tallest buildings in each borough ===

This lists the tallest building in each borough of New York City based on standard height measurement. The &quot;Year&quot; column indicates the year in which a building was completed.


== Tallest under construction or proposed ==

=== Under construction ===
This lists buildings that are currently under construction in New York City and are expected to rise to a height of at least . Buildings under construction that have already been topped out are also included, as are those whose construction has been suspended. For buildings whose heights have not yet been released by their developers, this table uses a floor count of 50 stories as the cutoff.

* Table entries with dashes (—) indicate that information regarding expected building heights or dates of completion has not yet been released.
=== Approved ===
This table lists buildings that are approved for construction in New York City and are expected to rise at least in height. For buildings whose heights have not yet been released by their developers, this table uses a floor count of 50 stories as the cutoff.

=== Proposed ===
This table lists buildings that are proposed for construction in New York City and are expected to rise at least in height. For buildings whose heights have not yet been released by their developers, this table uses a floor count of 50 stories as the cutoff.

* Table entries with dashes (—) indicate that information regarding building heights or dates of completion has not yet been released.

== Tallest destroyed or demolished ==
This table lists buildings in New York City that were destroyed or demolished and at one time stood at least in height.


== Timeline of tallest buildings ==
This lists buildings that once held the title of tallest building in New York City. Both Trinity Church and the Empire State Building have held the title twice, the latter following the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks. The Empire State Building was surpassed by One World Trade Center in 2012.

<text>No Man&#x27;s Land is a play by Harold Pinter written in 1974 and first produced and published in 1975. Its original production was at the Old Vic theatre in London by the National Theatre on 23 April 1975, and it later transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, July 1975 – January 1976, the Lyttelton Theatre April–May 1976, and New York&#x27;s Longacre Theatre from October–December 1976. It returned to the Lyttelton from January – February 1977. It is a two-act play.

==Setting==
&quot;A large room in a house in North West London&quot; on a summer night and the following morning.

==Characters==
*Hirst, &quot;a man in his sixties&quot;
*Spooner, &quot;a man in his sixties&quot;
*Foster, &quot;a man in his thirties&quot;
*Briggs, &quot;a man in his forties&quot;

Hirst is an alcoholic upper-class litterateur who lives in a grand house presumed to be in Hampstead, with Foster and Briggs, respectively his purported amanuensis and man servant (or apparent bodyguard), who may be lovers. Spooner, a &quot;failed, down-at-heel poet&quot; whom Hirst has &quot;picked up in a Hampstead pub&quot; and invited home for a drink, becomes Hirst&#x27;s house guest for the night; claiming to be a fellow poet, through a contest of at least-partly fantastic reminiscences, he appears to have known Hirst at university and to have shared male and female acquaintances and relationships. The four characters are named after cricket players. It has been suggested that Spooner was originally inspired by the poet Eddie Linden, whom Pinter knew.

==Plot synopsis==

===Act 1===
In the 1970s, Hirst, an ageing man of means begins a night of heavy drinking in his drawing room with an anonymous peer whom he only just met at a pub. Hirst&#x27;s talkative and somewhat disheveled guest, calling himself a poet, long-windedly explains how he is penetratingly perceptive, until he finally introduces himself as &quot;Spooner&quot;. The pair becomes increasingly intoxicated, Hirst remaining quiet as Spooner rambles on, culminating in his taunting Hirst&#x27;s masculinity and wife. Suddenly, Hirst rises and throws his glass, merely commenting &quot;No man&#x27;s land...does not move...or change...or grow old...remains...forever...icy...silent&quot;, before collapsing twice and crawling out of the room. Two domestic employees of Hirst&#x27;s, younger men named Foster and Briggs, enter, talk aimlessly, and question Spooner, who now becomes the softspoken man in the room.

Eventually, Hirst reenters and struggles to remember a recent dream. All are now drinking, and Hirst mentions an album of photographs he keeps, commenting on the appearances of the people in the album. He does not seem to remember Spooner&#x27;s identity, insisting that his true friends are kept safely in the album. Becoming less and less coherent, Hirst continues to ponder his dream—involving someone drowning—when Spooner abruptly says that he was the one drowning in the dream. Hirst drunkenly collapses again and Spooner now rushes in to Hirst&#x27;s aid, brushing away the two younger men and claiming to be Hirst&#x27;s true friend. The younger pair becomes defensive and accusatory, asserting their obligation to protect Hirst against &quot;men of evil&quot;. Briggs helps Hirst out of the room, and Foster concludes to Spooner, &quot;Listen. You know what it&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re in a room with the light on and then suddenly the light goes out? I&#x27;ll show you. It&#x27;s like this&quot;. He flicks off the lights, causing a blackout.

===Act 2===
Alone the next morning, Spooner stands from his chair and attempts to leave, but the door is locked. Briggs, Hirst&#x27;s manservant, soon enters; he delivers food and champagne, ignores Spooner&#x27;s queries about the locked door, and calls the other men poets. Hirst himself then bursts in, delighted to see Spooner, whom he strangely mistakes for, or pretends is, an old friend. He speaks as though he and Spooner were Oxbridge classmates in the 1930s, and the two bizarrely discuss scandalous romantic encounters they had with the same women, leading to a series of increasingly questionable reminiscences and ending with Spooner directly accusing Hirst of having an affair with his wife. 

Hirst separately launches into a rant about once-known faces in his photo album, and all four men are soon present once more, drinking champagne. An odd dynamic emerges where Spooner first pities the younger men&#x27;s employment but then ends up requesting employment from Hirst himself. After all this, Hirst merely replies &quot;Let&#x27;s change the subject for the last time&quot;, which he instantly regrets, since this is taken to mean that Hirst will be unable to change the subject ever again. He thinks back to his youth, when he mistakenly thought he saw a drowned body in a lake. Spooner now comments, &quot;No. You are in no man&#x27;s land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent.&quot; Hirst responds &quot;I&#x27;ll drink to that!&quot; and the lights fade slowly to black.

==Production history==
The London première of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, directed by Peter Hall, opened at the Old Vic Theatre (then home to the National Theatre), on 24 April 1975, starring John Gielgud as Spooner and Ralph Richardson as Hirst and with Michael Kitchen as Foster and Terence Rigby as Briggs. It transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, in London&#x27;s West End, on 15 July 1975 (Baker and Ross xxxiii). This production transferred to Broadway&#x27;s Longacre theatre in New York from October through December 1976, with Richardson nominated for the 1977 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his performance as Hirst. Peter Hall&#x27;s production returned to the National Theatre (NT), playing at the Lyttelton Theatre, from January through February 1977. The original production with Richardson and Gielgud was filmed for the National Theatre Archive and has been shown on British television as part of &quot;Pinter at the BBC&quot; on BBC Four. The production was also recorded and released by Caedmon Records and was nominated for Grammy Award.

A major revival from the Almeida Theatre Company that later transferred to the West End Harold Pinter Theatre (called the Comedy Theatre at the time), London, directed by David Leveaux, opened in February 1993, and starred Paul Eddington as Spooner and Pinter himself as Hirst; Douglas Hodge played Foster and Gawn Grainger played Briggs.

In the Broadway revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company directed by David Jones, which opened on 27 February 1994 at the Criterion Centre Stage Right Theatre, in New York City, with Jason Robards as Hirst, Christopher Plummer (nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) as Spooner, Tom Wood as Foster, and John Seitz as Briggs.

In 2001, another major revival at the NT was directed by Harold Pinter, with Corin Redgrave as Hirst, John Wood as Spooner, Danny Dyer as Foster, and Andy de la Tour as Briggs.

In the summer of 2008, a production directed by Rupert Goold premièred at the Gate Theatre, in Dublin, with Michael Gambon (Hirst), David Bradley (Spooner), David Walliams (Foster), and Nick Dunning (Briggs). Goold&#x27;s production transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, in the West End, London, opening on 7 October 2008 and closing on 3 January 2009, the week after Pinter&#x27;s death on 24 December 2008.

A production directed by Sean Mathias opened at Berkeley Rep in August 2013, with Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley. It opened on Broadway at the James Earl Jones Theatre, in repertory with &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, on 24 November 2013 (previews began on 31 October 2013). It closed on 30 March 2014, but was restaged in the UK in 2016, with Owen Teale and Damien Molony replacing Hensley and Crudup. It played at the Sheffield Lyceum, Newcastle Theatre Royal, Brighton Theatre Royal and Cardiff New Theatre before transferring to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. 

The play was staged as the closing production of Steppenwolf Theatre Company&#x27;s 2022-2023 season in Chicago, under the direction of Les Waters with theatre co-founder Jeff Perry (American actor) playing Hirst.
==Critical reception and interpretation==
In reviewing the London première, on 24 April 1975, Michael Billington, of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, observes that the play is &quot;about precisely what its title suggests&quot;:
the sense of being caught in some mysterious limbo between life and death, between a world of brute reality and one of fluid uncertainty. ... the play is a masterly summation of all the themes that have long obsessed Pinter: the fallibility of memory, the co-existence in one man of brute strength and sensitivity, the ultimate unknowability of women, the notion that all human contact is a battle between who and whom. ... It is in no sense a dry, mannerist work but a living, theatrical experience full of rich comedy in which one speech constantly undercuts another.

Over a decade after having written &quot;The Life and Work of Harold Pinter&quot; (1996), the first edition of his authorised biography of Pinter, Billington discusses his critical perspective on the play in his videotaped discussion for &quot;Pinter at the BBC&quot;, broadcast on BBC Four television from 26 October through 9 November 2002. After admitting that &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; is a &quot;haunting weird play&quot; that he himself &quot;can never fully understand – Who can? – but it works on you&quot;, he reviews the genesis of the play&#x27;s first line (&quot;As it is?&quot;), which came to Pinter in a taxicab while riding home from dinner out alone, and the thematic significance of the titular metaphorical phrase &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;, and finds &quot;something of Pinter&quot; in both of the main characters, each one a writer whom Pinter may have to some degree feared becoming: one &quot;with all the trappings of success but [who] is inured by fame, wealth, comfort&quot; (Hirst); the other, &quot;the struggling, marginal, the pin-striped writer&quot; who &quot;does not make it&quot; (Spooner); though when Billington put his theory to Pinter, Pinter said (jokingly), &quot;Well, yes, maybe; but I&#x27;ve never had two man-servants named Foster and Briggs.&quot;

In reviewing Goold&#x27;s revival of the play at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 2008, Billington points out that &quot;Hirst, a litterateur haunted by dreams and memories, is, as he tells Spooner, &#x27;in the last lap of a race I had long forgotten to run&#x27;. But, while his servants conspire to lead Hirst to oblivion, Spooner attempts a chivalric rescue-act, dragging him towards the light of the living. The assumption is that his bid fails, as all four characters are finally marooned in a no-man&#x27;s land &#x27;which remains forever, icy and silent&#x27;.&quot;

In this play replete with echoes of T. S. Eliot, Spooner may appear to have failed in his apparent efforts to ingratiate himself with and perhaps even to &quot;rescue&quot; Hirst from &quot;drowning&quot; himself in drink. But Spooner still remains in the house at the end of the play, &quot;in no man&#x27;s land,&quot; along with Hirst (and Foster and Briggs), and the play ends in an impasse much like that of Pinter&#x27;s 1960 play &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, to which critics compare &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

As various other critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: &quot;Yes, but what does it all mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the &#x27;gratuitous obscurity&#x27; of Harold Pinter&#x27;s poetic 1975 play when it was first produced by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Billington concludes that &quot;This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin&#x27;s lighting and Adam Cork&#x27;s subliminal sound,&quot; observing: &quot;when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [who was] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream.&quot;

Both Billington and Paul Taylor (in &quot;The Independent&quot;) give the production 4 out of 5 stars, while Charles Spencer, reviewing the production in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, like other critics making inevitable comparisons with the original production, rates it as &quot;equally fine, with Michael Gambon and David Bradley rising magnificently to the benchmark set by their illustrious predecessors,&quot; but points out that he too does not feel that he fully understands it: &quot;Even after three decades I cannot claim fully to understand this haunting drama that proves by turns funny, scary, and resonantly poetic, but I have no doubt that it is one of the handful of indisputable modern classics that Pinter has written, and a piece that will haunt and tantalise the memory of all who see it.&quot;

In another feature on Goold&#x27;s 2008 revival, following the responses of &quot;three Pinter virgins&quot; who did not understand or enjoy it (&quot;Matilda Egere-Cooper, urban music journalist: &#x27;Obscure and exhausting&#x27; &quot;; &quot;David Knott, political lobbyist: &#x27;Don&#x27;t expect to feel uplifted...&#x27; &quot;; and &quot;Susie Rushton, editor and columnist: &#x27;Where&#x27;s the joke?&#x27; &quot;), the &quot;Independent&quot;″s critic, Paul Taylor, reiterates his praise of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, concluding:
What is less clear is the purpose of the play&#x27;s undercurrent of homosexuality. In the opening scene there are repeated references to scopophilia and Spooner asks Hirst if he often hangs &quot;around Hampstead Heath&quot; and the pub Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle, both notorious for homosexual activity in the 1960s and ‘70s. Most analysts have tended to ignore this subtext but it is there. With this and lines with double meaning like &quot;You had a cottage?&quot; as well as oblique but explicit references to baleful mothers, &quot;quaint little perversions&quot;, women &quot;especially in Siam or Bali&quot;, &quot;Lord Lancer&quot;, a man called Bunty and male virginity, it seems likely that Pinter is playing a joke of some kind on more naive critics and admirers.

<text>NGC 2419 (also known as [[Caldwell_catalogue|Caldwell 25]]) is a globular cluster in the constellation Lynx. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31, 1788. NGC 2419 is at a distance of about 300,000 light years from the Solar System and at the same distance from the Galactic Center.

NGC 2419 bears the nickname &quot;the Intergalactic Wanderer,&quot; which was bestowed when it was erroneously thought not to be in orbit around the Milky Way. Its orbit takes it farther away from the galactic center than the Magellanic Clouds, but it can (with qualifications) be considered as part of the Milky Way. At this great distance it takes three billion years to make one trip around the galaxy.

The cluster is dim in comparison to more famous globular clusters such as M13. Nonetheless, NGC 2419 is a 9th magnitude object and is readily viewed, in good sky conditions, with good quality telescopes as small as 102mm (four inches) in aperture. Intrinsically it is one of the brightest and most massive globular clusters of our galaxy, having an absolute magnitude of −9.42 and being 900,000 times more massive than the Sun.

It was proposed that NGC 2419 could be, as Omega Centauri, the remnant of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy disrupted and accreted by the Milky Way. However, that hypothesis has been disputed.

Astronomer Leos Ondra has noted that NGC 2419 would be the &quot;best and brightest&quot; for any observers in the Andromeda Galaxy, looking for globular clusters in our galaxy since it lies outside the obscuring density of the main disk. This is analogous to the way the cluster G1 can be seen orbiting outside of the Andromeda Galaxy from Earth.

It was found to be composed of two different populations, one being more helium-rich than the other, which does not fit the current model for globular cluster formation (which leads to a very homogeneous population in the cluster). This raises new questions on how this globular cluster was formed.

<text>NGC 2438 is a planetary nebula in the southern constellation of Puppis. Parallax measurements by Gaia put the central star at a distance of roughly 1,370 light years. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 19, 1786. NGC 2438 appears to lie within the cluster M46, but it is most likely unrelated since it does not share the cluster&#x27;s radial velocity.

The object is a multi-shell planetary nebula with a bright inner nebula with a diameter of , consisting of two somewhat detached shells. It is expanding with a velocity of . The structure is surrounded by a fainter, mostly circular halo that is more visible on the western half, and has a diameter of . The mass of the main nebula is estimated at , while the shell has 0.5–. The main nebula has a temperature of about 10–13,000 K, rising to 15–17,000 K at the inner edge.

The nebula consists of material ejected from the central star during the asymptotic giant branch stage, beginning about 8,500 years ago. The main nebula was formed at about half that age. The central star of this planetary nebula is a 17.7-magnitude white dwarf, with a surface temperature of about .

<text>NGC 2451 is an open cluster in the Puppis constellation, probably discovered by Giovanni Battista Hodierna before 1654 and John Herschel in 1835. In 1994, it was postulated that this was actually two open clusters that lie along the same line of sight. This was confirmed in 1996. The respective clusters are labeled &quot;NGC 2451 A&quot; and &quot;NGC 2451 B&quot;, and they are located at distances of 600 and 1,200 light-years, respectively.

<text>Lynn Nancy Rivers (née Carruthers; born December 19, 1956) is an American politician and lawyer from Michigan. She served four terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
Rivers was born in Au Gres, Michigan, and graduated from Au Gres-Sims High School, Arenac County, in 1975. She was married the day after graduation, and had 2 children by age 21.

She received a B.A. in biological anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1987 and a J.D. from Wayne State University in 1992.

==Career==
She served as a trustee of the Ann Arbor board of education from 1984 to 1992. She was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives between 1993 and 1994.

Rivers was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 13th District to the United States House of Representatives for the 104th and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2003.

After Michigan lost a district in the United States 2000 Census reapportionment, much of her district was merged into a redrawn 15th District together with long-time incumbent John Dingell. Rivers challenged Dingell in the Democratic primary for the new 15th. However, running in a district that was over 65 percent new to her, she lost to Dingell by 18 points.

Immediately after leaving Congress, she taught political science at the University of Michigan and at Washtenaw Community College.

==Political positions==

===Mental health===
During her first US House run in 1994, Rivers spoke publicly about her long struggle with bipolar disorder. She was about 21 when she was diagnosed. While in Congress she spoke about her condition on the House floor, making her the first openly bipolar member of Congress. In 1998, the National Mental Health Association (NMHA) named her &quot;Legislator of the Year.&quot;

<text>NGC 2477 (also known as Caldwell 71 or the Termite Hole Cluster) is an open cluster in the constellation Puppis. It contains about 300 stars, and was discovered by Abbé Lacaille in 1751. The cluster&#x27;s age has been estimated at 700 million years.

== Visual appearance ==
NGC 2477 is a stunning cluster, almost as extensive in the sky as the full moon. It has been called &quot;one of the top open clusters in the sky&quot;, like a highly resolved globular cluster without the dense center characteristic of globular clusters. Burnham notes that several observers have remarked on its richness, and that although it is smaller than M46 (also an open cluster in Puppis), it is richer and more compact.

==Distance==
Burnham cites several published distances, ranging from to , where &quot;ly&quot; is the abbreviation for light year.

<text>Fate/stay night is a Japanese visual novel game developed by Type-Moon for Windows on January 30, 2004. Fate/stay night Réalta Nua (Irish for &quot;new star&quot;), was released on April 19, 2007, for the PlayStation 2, which replaced the sexual content with alternate scenes, added an extended ending scene to the &quot;Fate&quot; storyline, and featured voice actors from the 2006 anime series. It was later ported to Windows (as a trilogy covering the three storylines: &quot;Fate&quot;, &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot;) in 2011, PlayStation Vita in 2012, and Android and iOS in 2015. A remastered version of &quot;Réalta Nua&quot; was released for Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam in 2024, marking the first time the game was made available outside Japan. The plot focuses on a young mage named Shirou Emiya who becomes a warrior in a battle between &quot;Servants&quot; known as the Holy Grail War. Shirou bonds with a heroine through each route and confronts different adversaries participating in the war. The author, Kinoko Nasu, summarised &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; as:

...the story about legendary heroes and &quot;a boy meets a girl.&quot;... The main theme is &quot;conquering oneself.&quot; There are three story lines in Fate, each has a different themes. The first one is the &quot;oneself as an ideal.&quot; The second one is &quot;struggling with oneself as an ideal.&quot; The third one is &quot;the friction with real and ideal.&quot; This game is describing the growth of the main character Emiya Shirou. The first storyline shows his slanted mind, the next storyline shows his resolve, and the last storyline gives another resolution for him as a human. All three storylines are essentially equal, but they have different forms.

A manga series adaptation by Datto Nishiwaki has serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; magazine between the February 2006 and December 2012 issues. A 24-episode anime series created by Studio Deen aired in Japan between January and June 2006. Both mostly follow the &quot;Fate&quot; route but add events from other storylines. A film adaptation, &quot;Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works&quot;, also by Studio Deen, was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010. A second anime television series, &quot;Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works&quot;, was produced by Ufotable and aired between October 2014 and June 2015, following the game&#x27;s second route as opposed to the first. A second manga adaptation by Taskohna began in 2015 in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Young Ace&quot;, focusing solely on the third route. A film trilogy adapted &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot; route of the visual novel, with the first film, titled &quot;presage flower&quot;, released in 2017, the second film, titled &quot;lost butterfly&quot;, released in 2019, and the final film, titled &quot;spring song&quot;, released in 2020. A third manga adaptation by Daisuke Moriyama began in 2021 in ASCII Media Works&#x27;s &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;, focusing solely on the second route.

&quot;Fate/stay night&quot; spawned the Fate media franchise, consisting of a number of adaptations and spin-offs in various different media. On October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, titled &quot;Fate/hollow ataraxia&quot;. Its plot is set half a year after the events of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;. A light novel series titled &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, set as a prequel to &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, was published from 2006 to 2007, with an anime adaptation by Ufotable airing between October 2011 and June 2012. A spin-off magical girl manga series, &quot;Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya&quot;, began serialization in 2007 and as of 2024 has received four anime television series and two anime movies. Three fighting games have been released: &quot;Fate/unlimited codes&quot; for arcades and PlayStation 2, &quot;Fate/tiger colosseum&quot; and its sequel &quot;Fate/tiger colosseum Upper&quot; for PSP. An RPG titled &quot;Fate/Extra&quot; was released on 2010, and a companion game, &quot;Fate/Extra CCC&quot;, was released in 2013, both for PSP. A gacha game titled &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; was released on Android and iOS in 2015; an anime film adaptation by Lay-duce was released in late 2016, with sequel adaptations by Production I.G, CloverWorks and Signal.MD. , &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; grossed worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing mobile game of all time.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Fate/stay night&quot;″s gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game&#x27;s duration is spent reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters, narration, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a &quot;decision point&quot; where they are given a chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player must replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction. Finishing one route will unlock the next one. When interacting with the heroines in each route, an &quot;affection meter&quot; is created, which is raised by giving them an answer that pleases them. A &quot;True Ending&quot; can be unlocked depending on the player&#x27;s affection.

There are multiple ways in which the player can lose the game, including Shirou&#x27;s death or a decision that causes the heroine to be murdered. Should this happen, the player is taken to an area called the where Taiga Fujimura and Illyasviel von Einzbern give the player hints about what they should do to survive in the next attempt to complete the game.

==Plot==

The story revolves around Shirou Emiya, a hardworking and honest teenager who unwillingly enters a to-the-death tournament called the Fifth Holy Grail War, where combatants fight with magecraft and Heroes from throughout history for a chance to have their wishes granted by the eponymous Holy Grail. Orphaned and the sole survivor of a massive fire in Fuyuki City as a child, Shirou was taken in by a retired mage named Kiritsugu Emiya, who would die years later. His perceived responsibility to those who died and his salvation through his father formed a strong desire for justice and peace in him. Thus, he earnestly trains his body and minuscule ability with magecraft to someday greatly help others, even if people often abuse his generosity at his stage.

One evening, after seeing two devastatingly powerful beings trading blows at his school with swords and spears, he is attacked, as witnesses of supernatural are generally supposed to be eliminated. Chased to his home by the spear-wielding warrior Lancer and barely able to avoid his attacks, Shirou is about to be killed when he is saved by Saber. Saber, the personification of a renowned figure in history (Arturia Pendragon in her case), was created to aid participants in the War. In her supposedly accidental summoning and the appearance of the marks on Shirou&#x27;s hand, his entry as a Master into the Holy Grail War is formalized.

===Fate===
The first of the three heroines, Saber is a mighty warrior who keeps her identity secret, hence her substitute name after her role as a member of the Saber class. She also serves as the route&#x27;s servant protagonist. She was the victor of the Fourth Holy Grail War with another Master and claimed to be the strongest out of all Servants in the Saber Class. However, Shirou is against Saber&#x27;s constant aim for conflicts with other servants and instead seeks to ally with Rin. Shirou drops his pacifism when he discovers that his former friend, Shinji Matou, is a Master with the Servant Rider, aiming to sacrifice all students from their school to increase Rider&#x27;s powers.

Following Shinji and Rider&#x27;s defeat, Shirou learns that Saber cannot fight at full strength without exchanging Mana (magical energy) with her Master. During a confrontation with Master Illya and her Servant Berserker, Shirou has part of his magical circuits ripped out from his system and sacrificed to Saber to create a connection to her, and later assists her in defeating the enemy by projecting one of Artoria&#x27;s lost sword, the Sword-in-the-Stone Caliburn in combat. As Shirou seeks to keep Saber in their world, he learns from the priest Kirei Kotomine that the Holy Grail is cursed. It is revealed that Shirou&#x27;s late guardian, Kiritsugu, once used Saber to destroy the Grail. However, it instead caused the fire where Shirou lost his family.

Shirou rejects the idea of accepting his wish for the Holy Grail as he decides to accept his past and not forget Saber. Moved by Shirou, Saber also rejects the Holy Grail, believing she should not change Britain&#x27;s history and that she should accept herself. As Kotomine aims to use Illya&#x27;s body to recreate the Holy Grail, Shirou and Saber confront him and his Servant, Gilgamesh. Following Shirou&#x27;s and Saber&#x27;s victories, Shirou orders Saber to destroy the Grail. This causes Saber to go back to her last moments before her death, finally accepting her life. In the &quot;Réalta Nua&quot; version of the game, a overarching ending can be unlocked after all the routes, where Shirou fulfills his roles as a heroic spirit in order to meet Saber in Avalon.

===Unlimited Blade Works===
The second of the three heroines is Rin Tohsaka, a model student and idol of Shirou&#x27;s school who is secretly a mage and Master of Archer in the Holy Grail War. Her Servant Archer serves as the Servant protagonist of the route. She descends from a long, distinguished line of mages, with potential to become one of the 100 strongest human magi. Classmates dub Rin &quot;The Ice Queen&quot; for her cold, unreachable persona at school; however, this is simply a front to hide her actual status as a mage. Her presence in the story is established after Lancer mortally wounds Shirou at school. Upon seeing him, she revives him due to his connection with Sakura Matou, with whom Rin is closely acquainted. The two become allies in the war, unaware of Archer&#x27;s true identity as an adult Shirou from one of the series&#x27; numerous alternate universes.

Shirou loses control of Saber during the story but aims to fight with his magical strength to stop the war. Archer betrays Rin and reveals his despondency and bitterness over his past choices to Shirou. He subsequently challenges Shirou to a fight, hoping to destroy his story of being a hero. However, Shirou accepts his future regardless of his regrets and misery, sticking to Kiritsugu&#x27;s ideals. Gilgamesh tries to kill Archer and Shirou, with the former seemingly sacrificing himself to protect the latter. Later, Rin passes Shirou her Mana to fight Gilgamesh to replicate Archer&#x27;s powers. As Gilgamesh almost drags Shirou into their deaths, Archer uses his last strength to save the latter. In the True Ending, Shirou and Rin move to London to study magecraft, as well as start a romantic relationship.

===Heaven&#x27;s Feel===
The third and final heroine is Sakura, a first-year high school student and longtime friend of Shirou&#x27;s, who often visits his home to help him with his daily chores. A quiet, soft-spoken girl, Sakura can be surprisingly stubborn and holds a deep, unparalleled affection for Shirou. She is revealed to be Rin&#x27;s long-lost sister, raised by the Matou family, and has since suffered their abuse while training as a mage. Sakura is also discovered as the true Master of Rider, whom she reasserts control of from Shinji, making Rider the Servant protagonist of the route. In the route, Saber and Berserker are consumed by the shadows of Angra Mainyu. In the ensuing battle with True Assassin and the corrupted servants, a mortally wounded Archer transplants his left arm to save a dying Shirou.

It&#x27;s revealed that Zouken, Sakura&#x27;s adoptive grandfather, placed a shard of the lesser grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her body, infecting Sakura with Angra Mainyu. She becomes Dark Sakura, killing Shinji in his attempt to rape her. Despite the threat Sakura poses to humanity, Shirou, having fallen in love with her, abandons his ideal in favor of saving Sakura, despite Rin&#x27;s initial objections. Upon learning that Illya is another sacrifice to create the Grail, Shirou teams up with Kotomine and uses Archer&#x27;s powers to save Illya from Berserker. Rin is injured after finding herself unable to kill Sakura, while Rider and Shirou successfully eliminate Saber Alter. Shirou talks to Sakura and helps her regain her humanity, freeing her from her contract with Angra Mainyu. He then faces Kotomine in a final battle to later destroy the Grail. In True Ending, after Kotomine dies in combat, Illya sacrifices herself to destroy the Grail and extracts Shirou&#x27;s soul using a weaker version of the Third Magic. Rider later returns to the cave to grab and bring Shirou&#x27;s soul home, and Rin places it within a puppet body. Shirou, Sakura, and Rider live peacefully in Japan, while Rin moves to London to study magecraft.

==Development==
Kinoko Nasu first began writing &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; in college and had not intended it to be a game. Initially, Nasu only wrote what would become the game&#x27;s &quot;Fate&quot; storyline. However, the game went on to have three storylines, the &quot;Fate&quot; storyline being one of them. In his early drafts, &quot;Fate&quot;″s heroine Saber was a man, and the protagonist was a girl with glasses. This early draft was later embodied in the short original video animation (OVA) &quot;Fate/Prototype&quot;, which was released with the final volume of the &quot;Carnival Phantasm&quot; OVA series. Nasu set aside the project and went on to found Type-Moon with artist Takashi Takeuchi. After the success of their first visual novel &quot;Tsukihime&quot; in 2000, Type-Moon transitioned from a dōjin soft organization to a commercial organization. Nasu and Takeuchi decided to turn the old &quot;Fate&quot; story into a visual novel as Type-Moon&#x27;s first commercial product. In the beginning, Nasu was worried that because the main character was a girl, the story might not work as a bishōjo game. Artist Takeuchi suggested switching the protagonist&#x27;s and Saber&#x27;s genders to fit the game market.

The novel &quot;Makai Tensho&quot; influenced Nasu to write a fantasy story in which famous heroic personalities from all over the world would take part. The original idea was limited to the prototype of the &quot;Fate&quot; arc, where the main characters were the female master and her Servant Saber (the embodiment of King Arthur as a man). According to Nasu, this version contained elements of 1980s romance and ideas of transformations to world order, while the final version focuses on changes within people and has other purposes for using the Holy Grail. About a third of the scenario of the future &quot;Fate&quot; arc (up to the battle with Sasaki Kojiro) was completed at that time, but for several personal reasons, Nasu could not write further for more than ten years.

The first two-story arcs completed were &quot;Fate&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;; the latter was partially presented to the public in a preview booklet at Comiket in December 2001. Unlimited Blade Works was based on the idea of a character&#x27;s confrontation with himself and his own ideals, something unrealized during the development of Tsukihime for the arc of Yumizuka Satsuki. In 2002, it was found that the content that was already written was nearly equal in length to &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, leading to proposals to divide the game into two parts. However, due to the high cost of releasing two products at once, the arcs of Illya and Sakura were partially combined, resulting in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot;. Nasu original thought of extending the &quot;Fate&quot; route involving an alternative Fifth Holy Grail War where Shirou fought alongside Saber without a romantic relationship developing between them. Following their separation, Shirou would bond with Rin in a similar way to the true ending of &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;. The main theme in &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; is &quot;conquering oneself&quot;. There are three storylines in the visual novel; each has a different theme. The first one, &quot;Fate&quot;, is the &quot;oneself as an ideal.&quot; The second one, &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;, is &quot;struggling with oneself as an ideal.&quot; The third one, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot;, is &quot;the friction with real and ideal&quot;.

According to Nasu, the main theme of the resulting &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot; arc was chosen to apply the protagonist&#x27;s ideas in practice. This is in contrast it with &quot;Fate&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;, which paid most attention to the demonstration of Shirou&#x27;s ideals. Nasu wanted to portray him as a typical teenager while artist Takashi Takeuchi did not want him to have too much individuality to make players project themselves onto him. In 2002, Takeuchi suggested Gen Urobuchi, a well-known author of Nitroplus visual novels, to connect to the preliminary scenario of the game, but Urobuchi ultimately refused. Afterward, Nasu decided that &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; would be the most significant work in his life, created by him from beginning to end.

===Release history===
After translating the text into code, editing background images and sprites, and debugging audio-visual effects, on October 21, 2003, the game&#x27;s demo version was released on a CD with the magazine Tech Gian from Enterbrain, and on November 1 was posted on Type-Moon&#x27;s site. &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; was released in Japan on January 30, 2004, for Windows PCs. The opening animations were produced by Tatsunoko Productions.

A CERO C-rated version of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, titled &quot;Fate/stay night Réalta Nua&quot;, for the PlayStation 2 was scheduled to be released in late 2006. However, it was postponed until April 19, 2007. This version provided voice acting but the adult content were removed due to the intended broader target audience. In the Fate route, the 2004 release&#x27;s adult content was replaced with a much more anticipated scene from the writers, of which was eventually expanded with a subsequent prequel novel. This &quot;Magical Circuit Grafting&quot; scene was highly abstract and symbolic, revealing the Dragon&#x27;s Core aspect of Saber&#x27;s character that would subsequently remain as a key part of her characterization through the franchise into her appearance in Fate/Grand Order.

The updated re-release also provided not only this key part of the Fate route&#x27;s &#x27;Day 10 &amp; 11&#x27;, but also the true ending to the Fate route. Tatsunoko Productions produced three opening animations, based on the three branching storylines in the game. &quot;Fate&quot;, &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot; are the three branching storylines found within the game. They were released separately through digital download on Windows (but as the &quot;Réalta Nua&quot; version) in the beginning of 2012. A PlayStation Vita port of &quot;Réalta Nua&quot; was released in Japan on November 29, 2012, with three new opening animations by anime studio Ufotable and the option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, 16:9 or in-between.
On January 30, 2024, Type-Moon announced &quot;Fate/stay night Remastered&quot;. It was published by Aniplex worldwide on August 8, 2024 for the Nintendo Switch and Windows via Steam with Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese language options. The remaster is based on the PS Vita version of &quot;Réalta Nua&quot;, and marks the first official release of the visual novel outside Japan.

There have been only small changes to Shirou&#x27;s physical design since its inception. With red hair and stubborn eyes, Takeuchi aimed for a typical design of a straightforward &quot;shōnen&quot; manga genre character. However, he felt that it was too standard, so he added more circles in his eyes. Takeuchi has trouble bringing out Shirou&#x27;s expressions because of his unique eyebrows; as a result, Shirou remains the most difficult &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; character for him to draw. Their goal of creating &quot;a protagonist without a face&quot; to comply with the nature of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games in the initial release of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; is another reason Takeuchi had trouble drawing Shirou, who only appeared in a handful of scenes. In the re-released &quot;Réalta Nua&quot; version of the visual novel aimed at teenagers rather than just adults, the importance of showing non-adult content was increased. So Takeuchi had to draw Shirou more often.

On October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, titled &quot;Fate/hollow ataraxia&quot;. Its plot is set half a year after the events of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; and features new characters such as Avenger, Bazett Fraga McRemitz, and Caren Ortensia, alongside returning characters such as Shirō Emiya, Saber and Rin Tōsaka.

Readers of &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot; ranked the game second in a list of &quot;most interesting bishōjo games&quot; in August 2007.

In early 2007, the popularity of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; and the anime Japanese voice actors led to the launch of the &quot;Fate/stay tune&quot; internet radio drama, featuring the voice talent of Kana Ueda (Rin) and Ayako Kawasumi (Saber). In 2011, the writers Chris Klug and Josiah Lebowitz in their book &quot;Interactive storytelling for video games&quot; praised &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; as a strong example of branching storylines and interactive storytelling, comparing its depth and complexity to that of a traditional novel. In 2019, the franchise took first place in the Comiket event. The spin-off &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; was also a commercial success, surpassing the gross revenue of the video game franchise &quot;Metal Gear&quot; in four years. , &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; grossed worldwide, making it the seventh highest-grossing mobile game of all time.

===Critical response===
&quot;Fate/stay night&quot; is, according to various estimates, one of the most famous representatives of its genre. It has also been described as &quot;among the most well-received visual novels ever published&quot;.

It was noted that TYPE-MOON&#x27;s use of heroes from legends of antiquity encouraged acquaintance with their literary and mythological sources. Uno Tsunehiro from Kyoto University compared Shirou&#x27;s traumatic background in regards the city&#x27;s fire to survivors from the September 11 attacks while also showing different ways the Japanese society used to take care of their lives in such time. As a result, Tsunehiro views Shirou&#x27;s change in each route as a way to recover from the trauma, grow up and become an independent person. According to Lebowitz and Klug, the authors of the book on the theory of visual novels, the chosen format of the visual novel was optimally used since the concept of several plot arcs stretched the exposition of elements important for a common understanding of the plot and supported reader interest. The researchers also identified branchings that contain differently emotionally colored scenes that made it possible to view the situation or characters from several angles. A large number of sudden deaths, coupled with a strong effect of losing control over the situation, according to the authors of the monograph, gave the gameplay an additional emotional coloring and motivated players to continue playing the game, aided by well-developed plot twists. Despite the linearity of the passage of the story arcs, the option of completely skipping the already known scenes &quot;warned players of fatigue and again quickly dipped them into the thick of events&quot;. Story twists were called by various observers &quot;relevant and exciting&quot;. The darker narrative &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot; takes in comparison to &quot;Fate&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot; resulted in the route being compared to the horror genre. Rice Digital claimed the adult content was given a deep theme particularly in Heaven&#x27;s Feel when the heroine, Sakura, is treated differently due to her backstory, which makes her uneasy.

Critics and scholars praised Shirou. &quot;Gamasutra&quot; regarded Shirou as an interesting protagonist due to his childish ideals of becoming a hero and continuing this goal while growing up. The site added that the player&#x27;s in-game choices make Shirou&#x27;s character arcs change dramatically and allow Nasu to convey a different aspect of his ideal. The novelist Shūsei Sakagami praised how the user can witness Shirou&#x27;s &quot;gradual change from a robot to becoming a human&quot; through the three routes, developing distinctive traits in each one. In his analysis of the magical system and details of the personalities of the characters, Makoto Kuroda sees in the idea of Shirou to become a &quot;champion of justice&quot; a direct analogy with the traditional view of the life of bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, seeking to save other people at the cost of their own efforts and suffering. In Kuroda&#x27;s view, Buddhist concepts are opposed to the elements of faux-Christian ethics contained in the plot through the opposition of Shirou and Kirei Kotomine in the form of the main character&#x27;s rejection of the interpretation of Angra Mainyu as a creature who accepted and manifests the sins of others in the name of salvation. A popular online interpretation of the Fate route holds the opposition between Shirou, Saber and Avalon the &quot;divine construct&quot; on the one hand Kotomine to Kirei the &quot;fake priest&quot; and Gilgamesh the great pagan hero to be an incidentally Augustinian thematic point that contrasts true salvific love to the Earthly City&#x27;s desire for pleasure and possession in and outside the Church which Kirei and Gilgamesh respectively represent, just as is done in the St. Augustine&#x27;s City of God. In this interpretation, Shirou wins back the Cross as is promised in Nasu&#x27;s Arthurian source text symbolised by Shirou retrieving Caliburn. Avalon represents the created habit of charity, brought to bear through Saber&#x27;s development of love through Shirou&#x27;s acquisition of humility made by way of Saber. It is thereby argued by proponents of this reading that the Fate route is a story of charity overcomes City of Man as manifest both in the ecclesiastical sphere, represented by Kirei, and in the secular domain, embodied by Gilgamesh and the corrupted principle of evil (the Satanic Grail). The Last Episode signifies the Beatific Vision, while Heaven&#x27;s Feel is more of a Kierkegaardian tale, incidentally or otherwise. In the story aspect, the reviewers considered Shirou&#x27;s behavior and his attitude to his own ideals as the most interesting and well-developed part of the whole novel. The main character in each of the story arcs was placed in different conditions, which gave readers the opportunity to understand the conditions of the setting (&quot;Fate&quot;), to conduct a theoretical understanding of the ideals of the character (&quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;), to face the problems of their implementation (&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel&quot;) and, having combined this, to understand the details of his image.

The images of Rin, Saber, and Sakura received conflicting ratings. Thus, many reviewers recognized that the psychologically deepest arc is &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Feel,&quot; which is largely due to the sharp and versatile disclosure of the image of Sakura Matou, and her romantic line with Shirou is the most &quot;adult&quot; among all the heroines. According to Gen Urobouchi, the author of the &quot;Fate/Zero&quot; prequel, the relationship between the main character and Saber resembled the relationship &quot;between a boy and a boy who became a girl&quot; and more &quot;corresponded to the ancient Greek understanding of love&quot;. The very image of Saber was considered by some reviewers to be &quot;full of dignity and not falling into banality&quot;. According to some reviewers, Rin Tohsaka &quot;emphasized a different opinion about the ideals of Shirou&quot;, and her romantic line looked &quot;most realistic&quot;, where Rin and the main character &quot;compensated for the shortcomings and increased the virtues of each other&quot;. Despite this, TYPE-MOON&#x27;s Takashi Takeuchi maintained that in purview of the essential themes concerning the ideal and overcoming self, &quot;the first story [the Fate route] is Fate itself for me.&quot;

<text>Tivat (Serbo-Croatian: Tivat/Тиват, ) is a town in Coastal region of Montenegro, located in the Bay of Kotor. , its population was 9,367. Tivat is the centre of Tivat Municipality, which is the smallest municipality by area in Montenegro.

==Name==
In Serbo-Croatian, the city is known as (); in Italian and Venetian as . The town was first mentioned in the 14th century records of Kotor, as &quot;Teude&quot;, &quot;Theode&quot;, and &quot;Theudo&quot;, and has been connected to the Illyrian Queen Teuta, who ruled the region in 3rd century BC. Teuta had a residence in Rhizon and a summer residence between the church of St. Rocco in Donja Lastva and Seljanovo. The name could also come from the Greek word &quot;&quot; (, meaning &quot;way of God&quot;), or from the names of old Christian saints: Theodulus, Theodocius or Theodotus. Besides the popular name Theudo, a Latin expression, , comes from the 16th century. Finally, the name could originate from the Celtic word , town.

==History==
Archaeological sites attest that the area was inhabited in antiquity, with Greek and Roman settlements. Tombs and tombstones from the Roman period were discovered in Lastva and Opatovo.

Tivat is the youngest town in the Bay of Kotor area and was established on the plateau at the bottom of the Vrmac. During the Middle Ages, the fertile lands of the area belonged mostly to the aristocrats of Kotor, Prčanj and Dobrota. Estates, castles and chalets were there as well as the collective church of St Anton dating from 1373. Part of this inheritance, which was the property of the wealthy Buća family, is a historic chalet which today houses Tivat&#x27;s museums and galleries. The residence of the metropolitan of the bishopric of Zeta was built from the 13th to the 15th century on the Prevlaka Island. Tivat, known as in Venetian, was under the Republic of Venice as a part of Albania Veneta from 1420 to 1797. In those centuries Teodo enjoyed economic development that attracted many Serb refugees from Ottoman-held areas. Some Venetian-style buildings are still standing today.

Rapid development of Tivat started in the second half of 19th century when the Austrian empire built a maritime arsenal for its fleet. Still the town shaped itself by developing small industry. In the beginning of 1918, in the Tivat Bay sailors revolted against the mighty Austrian empire. With great approval and support, people from this area followed their revolutionary actions. The period between two world wars was marked with syndicate activity in Račica, Krtoli and Arsenal. Between 1941 and 1943 the town was part of the Italian Governatorate of Dalmatia.

In 1889, a naval arsenal was built by Austrians, and was later used as a naval military base of the Italian Navy, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and the Army of Montenegro. The JNA enjoyed an international reputation as a powerful, well-equipped, and well-trained force. The base was also used by Russia and Libya as the technical base for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of their ships and submarines.

==Geography==

Tivat is located in the central part of the Bay of Kotor (&quot;Boka Kotorska&quot;, or simply &quot;Boka&quot;), south of mount Vrmac. The municipality lies mostly south of the town, and has an exit to open sea at the tourist location Pržno inlet near Radovići village to the south. Its central part, where Tivat Airport is located, lies in fertile Grbalj valley. The airport is located near the isthmus of Luštica peninsula, which belongs to the municipality of Herceg Novi for the most part.

Tivat has about 14,000 inhabitants. It is away from Herceg Novi, away from Kotor, away from Budva, from Dubrovnik and from Podgorica. Geomorphologically, Tivat is composed of three areas. The first is the hills and peaks of Vrmac, Velji Vrh () and Popova glava (). Water activity formed capes Seljanovo, Pakovo and Račica. The second area is Tivat field, flattened by water activity. The third area is Krtoli with islands – Island of Flowers, St. Marko, and Lady of Mercy which is bordered by Novski bay on the north-west and Grbalj area on the south-east.

==Demographics==
Tivat is the 12th largest city in terms of population, which was 10,743 in 2023.

The majority of the city’s population consists of Montenegrins, who make up 34.31%, followed by Serbs at 32.23% (2023 census). The same census records that Croats account for 12.89% of residents.
Since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, a significant number of Russians (5.41%) and Ukrainians (1.07%) have moved to Tivat.

Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are mutually intelligible as standard varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. Serbian is the most spoken language in the town, with 37.84% of the population using it, followed closely by Montenegrin at 34.73%. Russian ranks third at 6.21%, while Croatian is spoken by 4.99%. Other languages (Albanian, Bosnian, Ukrainian, and undeclared) speak 16.23% of population.

=== Religion ===
Religion in Tivat is diverse. The predominant religion is Eastern Orthodoxy (64.05%), primarily practiced by the majority of Montenegrins and Serbs. However, Tivat is also home to other religious communities, including Catholics (21.45%), Muslims (4.62%), and other smaller religious communities. There are also 8.11% of non-religious people. The town has Orthodox churches, Catholic churches, mosques and other places of worship catering to the religious needs of its inhabitants.

==Sports==
The local football team is FK Arsenal Tivat, who have spent several seasons in the country&#x27;s second tier. They share their Stadion u Parku with rugby team RFC Arsenal Tivat. The town&#x27;s basketball team is KK Teodo Tivat.

==Tourism==

Already a popular tourist resort, Tivat is set to become a nautical tourism centre for the southern Adriatic.

The inlets near Prevlaka, as well as the localities of Župa and Kalimanj, provide great conditions for the construction of marinas and yachting clubs. Canadian businessman Peter Munk bought a naval shipyard in Tivat, intending to transform it into a luxury vacation resort and a marina for luxury yachts called Porto Montenegro.

In 1971 Tivat Airport acquired a modern runway and is now a significant airport for foreign air traffic. It served 1,367,282 passengers in 2019.

Although it is the youngest town in the Boka region, Tivat has a number of tourist sites. Renaissance Summer House Buca in the centre of city, Ostrvo Cvijeća (Flowers’ Island) with sacred monuments, Gornja Lastva, the old nucleus at an altitude of , the magnificent sandy beach at Plavi Horizonti and the Sveti Marko Island with ex-Club Med cottages are the most visited. In the city itself there is the natural port Kalimanj. There is also a choice of cultural events, such as &quot;Bocce Olympiad&quot; and &quot;Summer Fest&quot;. Tivat boasts a botanic garden planted with gifts from Bokan sailors who brought back a wide variety of exotic tree species and ornamental plants from their voyages.

==Transport==

Tivat is connected with the rest of Montenegro by the Adriatic Highway, a two-laned road that runs down the length of Montenegrin coast. Travelling inland is possible by leaving the Adriatic Highway at Budva or Sutomore (through the Sozina tunnel).

A ferry operates on the Kamenari - Lepetani line across the Verige Strait, eliminating the need to go all the way around Boka Kotorska bay in order to reach the Herceg Novi riviera. It is speculated that a future Verige bridge will be constructed across the bay.

Tivat Airport is away from the city centre, and is one of the two international airports in Montenegro, the other one being Podgorica airport. Traffic at the airport follows the seasonal nature of the tourism industry in coastal Montenegro, with 80% of the total volume of passengers being handled during the peak season (May–September). Due to its proximity to the town, the airport does not operate during the night.

<text>Type-Moon (stylized as TYPE-MOON) is a Japanese video game company, best known for their visual novels, co-founded by author Kinoko Nasu and illustrator Takashi Takeuchi. It is also known under the name for its publishing and corporate operations, as it is the company official name, while Type-Moon is a brand name as a homage to the original doujin group. After creating the popular visual novel &quot;Tsukihime&quot; as a doujin soft circle, Type-Moon has since incorporated and produced the even more popular visual novel &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, which became its most well-known title. Both series have also been adapted into anime and manga series that have amassed a global fanbase.

==History==

Type-Moon was founded by artist Takashi Takeuchi and writer Kinoko Nasu, whose first project was the novel &quot;Kara no Kyoukai&quot;, which was originally released in October 1998 and reprinted in 2004. The company name Type-Moon comes from one of Nasu&#x27;s older works, , written for the angel-themed doujin anthology &quot;Angel Voice&quot; in May 1999. On December 28, 2000, Type-Moon released the adult Windows visual novel &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, which sold extremely well and amassed a large fanbase because of its comprehensive and expansive storyline and writer Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s unique style of storytelling. The game led to the creation of numerous top-selling merchandise, memorabilia, and a fanbase numbering millions worldwide. &quot;Tsukihime&quot; was adapted soon after in 2003 into an anime series, &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot;, which was produced by J.C.Staff and licensed by Geneon in North America, and a manga series based upon &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot; that has been published between October 2003 and September 2010.

Soon after, on January 21, 2001, Type-Moon released a bonus disk to &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, &quot;Plus-Disk&quot;, which featured four short stories and various multimedia. In August 2001, Type-Moon released a fan disk to &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, &quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot;, and soon, in April 2003, released &quot;Tsuki-Bako&quot;, a specially packaged three-disk set that included &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, &quot;Plus-Disk&quot;, and &quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot;, as well as a remixed soundtrack for both games and more multimedia.

On December 30, 2002, Type-Moon, in association with French-Bread (known as Watanabe Seisakujo before 2003), released their first fighting game, &quot;Melty Blood&quot;, a PC-based doujin game based on the &quot;Tsukihime&quot; universe, which was very popular and was followed soon after by an expansion, &quot;Melty Blood Re-ACT&quot;, released on May 20, 2004, to which a patch update, &quot;Melty Blood Re-ACT Final Tuned&quot;, was released as a free download over the Internet. &quot;Melty Blood&quot; is widely considered among the best doujin 2D fighting games ever made and has been released as an arcade port, &quot;Melty Blood: Act Cadenza&quot;, on March 25, 2005, and was released on the PS2 platform on August 10, 2006.

Type-Moon soon transitioned from a doujin soft organization to a commercial organization. On 30 January 2004, they released the first commercial release, a PC-based adult visual novel game, &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, which broke all records on its opening day and became immensely popular. It was later adapted into an anime series that aired 24 episodes in Japan starting 6 January 2006; a second anime series that premiered on October 4, 2014; and a manga series that ran in publication between 26 December 2005 and 26 October 2012, in Monthly Shounen Ace. A sequel to &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, &quot;Fate/hollow ataraxia&quot;, was released on 28 October 2005. &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; was also released on the PS2 platform on April 19, 2007. A prequel, &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, was released as a light novel written by Gen Urobuchi (from nitro+) under Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s supervision, featuring art by Takashi Takeuchi, in 2006–2007, followed by an animated adaptation by ufotable in 2011–2012.

At Comiket 72 on August 27, 2007, they released the &quot;All Around TYPE-MOON drama CD&quot;.

In August 2019, Type-Moon announced that they established a new company called Type-Moon Studio BB, a video game development studio with former Square Enix and Atlus employee Kazuya Nino, who was a director for the series &quot;Trauma Center&quot;, &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest Builders&quot; as the head of the studio. According to Nino, the company plans to develop medium to large-scale 3D games in cooperation with external developers and small-scale 2D games developed in-house.
