<text>, also known as , or simply , was a Japanese author and Buddhist monk. His most famous work is &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot; (&quot;Essays in Idleness&quot;), one of the most studied works of medieval Japanese literature. Kenko wrote during the early Muromachi and late Kamakura periods.

==Life and work==
Kenkō was probably born around 1283, as the son of an administration official. Forged documents by the Yoshida Shinto authorities claimed that his original name was Urabe Kaneyoshi (卜部 兼好), and that his last name was later changed to Yoshida (吉田); all of this was recently demonstrated to be false, according to the latest research by Ogawa Takeo. He became an officer of guards at the Imperial palace. Later in life, he retired from public life and became a Buddhist monk and hermit. The reasons for this are unknown, but it has been conjectured that it was either due to his unhappy love for the daughter of the prefect of Iga Province, or his mourning over the death of Emperor Go-Uda that caused his transformation.

Although he also wrote poetry and entered some poetry contests at the imperial court (his participation in 1335 and 1344 is documented), Kenkō&#x27;s enduring fame is based on &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot;, his collection of 243 short essays, published posthumously. Although traditionally translated as &quot;Essays in Idleness,&quot; a more accurate translation would be &quot;Notes from Leisure Hours&quot; or &quot;Leisure Hour Notes.&quot; Themes of the essays include the beauty of nature, the transience and impermanence of life, traditions, friendship, and other abstract concepts. The work was written in the &quot;zuihitsu&quot; (&quot;follow-the-brush&quot;) style, a type of stream-of-consciousness writing that allowed the writer&#x27;s brush to skip from one topic to the next, led only by the direction of thoughts. Some are brief remarks of only a sentence or two; others recount a story over a few pages, often with discursive personal commentary added. Aside from his magnum opus &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot;, another of his works is &quot;A Cup of Sake Beneath the Cherry Trees&quot;, which is a compilation of reflections and essays of his thoughts, by which it primarily discusses about the fleeting pleasures of life.

The &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot; was already popular in the 15th century and was considered a classic from the 17th century onwards. It is part of the modern Japanese high school curriculum, as well in some International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme schools.

<text>The Senate of Canada Building () is a government building and former railway station that serves as the temporary seat of the Senate of Canada. Located at 2 Rideau Street in downtown Ottawa, it was known as Ottawa Union Station and served as the city&#x27;s central railway station from 1912 until 1966. From 1966 to 2018, it was operated by the Government of Canada as the Government Conference Centre. The building currently includes a temporary Senate chamber, as well as some Senate offices and committee rooms. 

It is situated at the intersection of Wellington Street and the Rideau Canal, across the street from the Château Laurier hotel (which was constructed around the same time). It is from Parliament Hill and Confederation Square.

==History==
===History of Railways in Ottawa===
Before the turn of the twentieth century, several railway companies had run lines into the city and had begun to build railway stations. In chronological order:
#New Edinburgh: Bytown and Prescott Railway
#Broad Street: Canada Central Railway, QMO&amp;O: 1870, 1881, 1896, 1900
#Elgin Street: Canada Atlantic Railway: early 1880s
#Nicholas Street at Mann Avenue: Ottawa and New York Railway: 1895

Broad Street, in the Lebreton Flats area, was the site of several stations including the first Union station (1881), which perished by fire in 1896 and again in 1900 and was rebuilt each time. The last one closed in 1920. Broad Street was near the Prince of Wales Bridge, the link to Montreal via the north shore of the Ottawa River. Broad Street itself no longer exists, erased as part of the National Capital Commission&#x27;s efforts at improving the capital area.

Ottawa became part of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s transcontinental rail service on June 28, 1886, when the first Pacific Express arrived at Broad Street from Montreal via Lachute and Hull, Quebec, on its way to Sudbury, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Port Moody, B.C. It used the existing Prince of Wales Bridge to cross the Ottawa River near the site of the present-day O-Train Bayview Station, west of Parliament Hill. This rail bridge had been built in 1880 by the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway and was transferred to Canadian Pacific in 1882.

However, there was no centrally located station until 1895, through efforts of John Rudolphus Booth. Booth was a Canadian lumber baron known for creating Canada&#x27;s largest sawmill right in Ottawa, near Chaudière Falls. His mill&#x27;s capacity exceeded the distribution infrastructure, and he looked to rail as a solution. (Eighteen years previous, he had established the Canada Atlantic Railway.) Booth had built a central depot in 1895 just south of Rideau Street, on the east side of the canal and reachable by way of a covered stairway from Sappers Bridge. The station seemed to not be truly serving the needs of the railway companies, since it was built for the interests of the Canada Atlantic Railway.

CPR&#x27;s Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge built in 1901 became the second railway bridge to cross the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Hull. It led to Booth&#x27;s central depot. In 1905, Booth sold the Canada Atlantic Railway to the Grand Trunk Railway.

In 1910, the Grand Trunk was apportioned part of the Rideau Canal in order to build a new station and hotel. The hotel would become the famous Chateau Laurier, and the station would become Ottawa&#x27;s Union Station.

===Construction of Union Station===

The building was opened by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1912 as Ottawa&#x27;s central railway station, and the hotel was built across the street to serve travelers. A tunnel under Rideau Street links the station and the hotel. Over the course of the following years, passenger services of other railways moved to this station, thereby clarifying and unifying passenger travel in the city. When the last Canadian Pacific trains moved from the old Union Station on Broad Street to Grand Trunk Central station on January 4, 1920, the old station was closed and the Grand Trunk station became Ottawa Union Station.

The June 1912 opening of the Union Station and the Chateau Laurier was not met with much fanfare, since Grand Trunk Railway general manager Charles Melville Hays had just perished in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster two months previously.

The Doric Roman Revival multi pillar Union station was originally designed by New York-based architect Bradford Lee Gilbert who was eventually dismissed due to concerns of mismanagement. The Montreal firm of Ross and MacFarlane took over the project, making many design changes to the station. Ross and MacFarlane also took over the design of the Château Laurier and later built Toronto&#x27;s Union Station.

Both Canadian National Railways (successor to the Grand Trunk) and Canadian Pacific Railway operated regularly scheduled passenger trains through the facility until it ceased operations on July 31, 1966.

===Connection to railways===
Several tracks which originated from the main railway infrastructure in Ottawa ran immediately adjacent to the Rideau Canal (right on its east banks) and led northward into the city. They approached Union Station through several sheds. From the sheds, emerged two tracks (on the east side of the Rideau Canal), and continued along, proceeding under the bridge where Wellington Street crosses the canal. They then ran immediately adjacent to the west side of Chateau Laurier, in a structure which was used for a time in a converted form, by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography. The track continued, where there is now a paved road and ran to the Alexandra (Interprovincial) Bridge.

Once in Hull, there was the possibility to continue to other parts of Quebec, or to return to Ottawa by making a turn and returning over the Prince of Wales Bridge. Some of the pathways in present-day Gatineau are on locations where rails had once made this possible.

===Post 1966===
In 1966, the National Capital Commission decided to remove the tracks along the east side of the Canal as part of an urban renewal plan. They were replaced by a scenic drive, and a new Ottawa station was built just east of Ottawa&#x27;s downtown area in the neighbourhood of Eastway Gardens. While the NCC had originally planned to tear down the structure, it was spared, becoming the centre of Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1967. After sitting empty for many years, it was turned into the Government Conference Centre. A new entrance and canopy at the rear of the building was built to provide greater security for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers meeting held in 1973. The same year, artist Bruce Garner sculpted bronze doors for the new entrance, titled &quot;Reflections of Canada&quot;. The tracks and sheds south of the station were demolished and now taken over by Colonel By Drive and the Rideau Centre.

It had since been home to many gatherings of civil servants and politicians. In 1981, a pivotal meeting of federal justice minister Jean Chrétien and provincial justice ministers Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow in the kitchen of the conference centre struck what was called the &quot;Kitchen Accord&quot; about the patriation of the Constitution of Canada. In 2001, the building hosted the G20 conference, a gathering of 20 finance ministers from around the world.

As well as hosting conferences, the building was also sometimes used as a gallery. A section of the Berlin Wall was on display inside the main entrance from September 27, 1991, until January 29, 2011. Because the location of the display was not widely publicized, it was decided that the segment would be more prominent at its new location in the Canadian War Museum.

===Architecture===
The building is inspired by the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The main departures hall (now the main conference area) is based on the Great Hall of the Roman Baths of Caracalla at 3/4 scale. It is therefore similar to the now-destroyed departures hall of New York Penn Station.

The cavernous structure has never been well suited to its role as a conference centre. In the mid-1990s a proposal was made to turn it into the new home for the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, but these plans fell through. In his final year in office, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced that the building would become home to a new museum of Canadian political history, but incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin cancelled this project, and it has remained a conference centre.

In 2007, the idea of reverting the building back to its original use sprang up as Ottawa considered various proposals for regional commuter rail systems. It is seen as being feasible to do so (although it would require a long tunnel to reconnect to the existing railway tracks) ; however, the Government of Canada&#x27;s Department of Public Works says the building is not for sale.

===Temporary Senate of Canada building===
In July 2013, it was announced by Public Works Canada that the building would be used to temporarily accommodate the Senate chamber (in the main concourse of the old train station) along with 21 Senate offices and three committee rooms (in the old general waiting room) while the Centre Block undergoes major rehabilitation work projected to take up to ten years. It was decided that the need to rehabilitate this historical building presented a perfect opportunity to find an interim home for the Senate. The works which are already well under way, will include:

* seismic reinforcement;
* restoration of the masonry;
* replacement of roofing materials including skylights, replacement of obsolete electrical, mechanical and life safety systems to meet current codes;
* renovation of the interior space;
* removal of outdated conference amenities added in the 1960s (i.e. translation booths);
* conformity to universal accessibility requirements;
* abatement of hazardous materials; and
* expansion of the loading dock, to improve serviceability limitations of the building.

In February 2019, the Senate of Canada Building formally re-opened in its current role.

<text>Ipsos MORI was the name of a market research company based in London, England which is now known as Ipsos and still continues as the UK arm of the global Ipsos group. It was formed by a merger of Ipsos UK and MORI in October 2005.

The company is a member of the British Polling Council and Market Research Society.

==History==
In 1946, Mark Abrams formed a market research company called Research Services Ltd. (RSL). RSL operated until 1991 when it was acquired by Ipsos, becoming Ipsos UK. 

MORI (Market and Opinion Research International) was founded in 1969 by Robert Worcester. Robert Worcester stepped down from chairmanship of MORI in June 2005. Ipsos announced it would acquire MORI in October 2005 for £88 million, and would merge it with Ipsos UK. The merged company was named Ipsos MORI. In February 2022 the company rebranded to simply .

==Methodology==
Ipsos MORI&#x27;s research is conducted via a wide range of methodologies, using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), as well as face-to-face (CAPI) and Internet surveys. Many telephone surveys use a system called random digit dialing to interview a representative group of the population.

==Controversies==
In May 2013, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Ipsos MORI had negotiated an agreement with the EE mobile phone network to commercialise the data on that company&#x27;s 23 million subscribers. The article stated that Ipsos MORI was looking to sell this data to the Metropolitan Police and other parties. The data included &quot;gender, age, postcode, websites visited, time of day text is sent [and] location of customer when call is made&quot;. When confronted by the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police indicated that they would not be taking the discussions any further. Ipsos MORI defended their actions, stressing that the company only received anonymised data, without any personally identifiable data on an individual customer, and underlining that reports are only ever made on aggregated groups of more than 50 customers.

<doc id="983079" wikidata="Q2012083" url="?curid=983079" title="Pitch (filmmaking)">
<text>In filmmaking, a pitch is a concise verbal (and sometimes visual) presentation of an idea for a film or TV series generally made by a screenwriter or film director to a film producer or studio executive in the hope of attracting development finance to pay for the writing of a screenplay.

The expression is borrowed from &quot;sales pitch&quot;. A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project. Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker&#x27;s project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values. Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent pitch trailer as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker&#x27;s vision.

Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full script or teleplay, animated productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone. For example, the animated television show &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, Dan Povenmire and Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, needed to convince overseas executives for The Walt Disney Company to greenlight the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.

Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program. Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with &quot;Oliver&quot; in &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;Luke&quot; on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. Networks also try to force their ideas on series&#x27; producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers. In 1992, the crew of the animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot; was approached by Nickelodeon, which pitched the idea of a &quot;Rugrats&quot; Hanukkah special. Paul Germain, co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a passover special, which he dubbed a &quot;funny idea.&quot; After they closed production for that special, they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode &quot;A Rugrats Chanukah.&quot;

<text>Kelvin Goertzen (born June 12, 1969) is a Canadian politician who served as the 23rd premier of Manitoba from September to November, 2021. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, he is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for Steinbach, first elected in the 2003 provincial election, and was re-elected in 2007, 2011, 2016, 2019 and most recently in 2023. Goertzen served as interim leader of the PC party, from September 1, 2021 to October 30, 2021. He was sworn as premier on September 1, 2021. Goertzen was succeeded as premier on the afternoon of November 2, 2021, by Heather Stefanson who won the PC leadership election on October 30. Goertzen, upon his swearing-in, selected Rochelle Squires as his deputy premier. Goertzen resumed his role as Deputy Premier of Manitoba on November 3, 2021. His final posts in the Stefanson Government were Government House Leader, Minister of Justice and Attorney General, and Minister responsible for Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI). He currently serves as the Deputy Leader of the PC Party alongside Kathleen Cook.

== Early life and education ==

Goertzen was born on June 12, 1969 in Winnipeg, Manitoba but was raised in Steinbach, Manitoba. He attended public school in Steinbach and graduated high school from the Steinbach Regional Secondary School in June 1987. Goertzen obtained a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Economics, a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Law each from the University of Manitoba. While attending Robson Hall law school at the University of Manitoba, Goertzen was awarded more than a dozen academic prizes and was the school&#x27;s top student during his second year of law studies.

== Community involvement ==

Goertzen served for two years as the Vice-President of the Steinbach Arts Council and served as Vice-President of the Southeast Helping Hands Food Bank in Steinbach for seven years. He has been involved as a participant and fundraiser in a number of community related causes including the Mennonite Heritage Village Museum and the Steinbach Association for Community Living. He is a member of the South East Rotary Club.

In June 2007, Goertzen was awarded the &quot;HOPE&quot; medal by the Lions Club Foundation of Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario for his community service work helping those less fortunate in Manitoba . In 2012 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in recognition of community service by Governor General of Canada David Johnson.

== Political involvement==

Goertzen became involved in political activities while attending high school, serving as an early organizer for the Reform Party of Canada. In 1995, Goertzen was hired as an intern at the Manitoba Legislature serving with the Progressive Conservative Caucus. Following the internship, he served in the Manitoba Department of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship and subsequently worked as an Executive Assistant to MLAs Jim Penner and Albert Driedger. Following the 2000 federal election, Goertzen also worked as an advisor to Provencher Member of Parliament Vic Toews and was a key local organizer for Toews in the 2000, 2004 and 2006 federal elections. In 2003, he participated in a public protest against the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada.

Prior to seeking elected office himself, Goertzen also served as the President of the Steinbach Progressive Conservative Association, as a Regional Director on the Board of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party and as a member of the Management Committee of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party.

== Elected office ==

One week prior to the calling of the 2003 provincial election, Steinbach MLA Jim Penner announced he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and would not be seeking re-election. After the election was called a short nomination process occurred. Some critics suggested Goertzen&#x27;s service as local association President gave him an advantage in the short nomination time frame. The sudden events had no impact on the election result, however. Steinbach is one of the Manitoba PCs&#x27; safest seats, and Goertzen was elected with over 74% of the popular vote despite the poor showing of PC candidates elsewhere in the province. Goertzen became the youngest MLA ever elected from Steinbach since its creation in 1990, as well as the first Manitoba Legislative Intern to be elected to the Manitoba Legislature.

After his election to the Manitoba Legislature, Goertzen was promoted to the shadow cabinet as Chief Justice Critic and in 2005 was also appointed Deputy House Leader. As Justice Critic, Goertzen called for increased police resources, stronger laws against organized crime, electronic monitoring of sex offenders and a drug treatment court to assist individuals addicted to drugs and alcohol. In 2005-2006, Goertzen held a series of informational meetings across Manitoba about Crystal Meth and lobbied for new legislation to allow parents of drug addicted teenagers to place their children in drug treatment. The NDP government accepted that suggestion and legislation was passed June 13, 2006.

Goertzen was a strong supporter of Opposition Leader Stuart Murray and refused to participate in internal Caucus dissent that ultimately led to the end of Murray&#x27;s leadership in November 2005.

Goertzen was among the first MLAs to endorse the provincial PC leadership campaign of Hugh McFadyen who eventually won the leadership. McFadyen reappointed Goertzen as Justice Critic after his leadership election and also appointed him the PC House Leader. Goertzen was again nominated the provincial PC candidate for Steinbach on September 8, 2006. On May 22, 2007 Goertzen was re-elected with 83% of the vote, the largest victory in the history of the riding.

In February 2010, Goertzen was named Deputy Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On October 4, 2011, Goertzen was re-elected in Steinbach by another large majority, although the PC&#x27;s once again lost the election to the NDP. With the resignation of McFayden as party leader after the election, there was some speculation in the local media that Goertzen may be a candidate for the position.

Following the 2011 election and selection of Brian Pallister as leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party, Goertzen was again appointed House Leader and Justice Critic for the PC Caucus. In 2013 he led a filibuster in the Manitoba Legislature to protest the increase of the provincial sales tax (PST) by the NDP government.

In 2013, despite widespread media speculation, he declined to run for the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of Provencher, centered on Steinbach, following the resignation of MP Vic Toews.

Following the Progressive Conservative victory in the 2016 provincial election, newly-elected premier Pallister named Goertzen as a member of the new cabinet, assigning him the office of Health, Seniors and Active Living.

In May 2018, Goertzen was strongly criticized for speaking at an anti-abortion rally in Steinbach, and for constant deferral of questions related to women&#x27;s reproductive matters, including abortion, to Rochelle Squires, minister of the status of women.

In September 2020, Goertzen made a Facebook post emphasizing the right to refuse vaccination, which received widespread condemnation by the public and which many medical experts considered to be problematic coming from an education minister and previous health minister.

== Personal life==

Goertzen married his wife Kimberley Hiebert in 1997. They live in Steinbach, Manitoba and have one son.

Goertzen has published several articles related to law and politics including in the &quot;Asper Review of International Business and Trade Law&quot; (Volume 3- 2003) and &quot;Underneath the Golden Boy&quot; (Volume 3-2004). In November 2006, he published a book on the life of Jim Penner, his predecessor in the Legislature, entitled &quot;A Life Well Lived: The Story of Jim Penner and Penner Foods&quot; (National Library of Canada ).

<text>Bank of Valletta plc (BOV) is a Maltese bank and financial services company headquartered in Santa Venera. It is the oldest established financial services provider in Malta and one of the largest. As of 2014, the bank had 44 branches, 6 regional business centres, a head office, and a wealth management arm located around the Maltese Islands. It has representative offices in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium and Italy.

BOV has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==
With the advent of British rule in Malta, a group of English and Maltese merchants established Anglo-Maltese Bank, which commenced operations on 23 June 1809. Banco di Malta was established on 1 May 1812. Anglo-Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta began early on to issue their own promissory banknotes (payable at sight) at first in Scudi denominations and subsequently in Sterling. The third bank to be set up in Malta was B. Tagliaferro e Figli, which too was founded in 1812. The fourth bank established in Malta was Josef Scicluna et Fils, set up in 1830. These four banks would eventually merge, in stages, to form the National Bank of Malta. This was done in order to have strength in numbers at a time when there was a fear that the government was after the private banks .

Anglo-Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta merged in January 1946 under the name National Bank of Malta.

In 1949, Sciclunas Bank affiliated to the newly established bank. Twenty years after that, i.e., in 1969, National Bank of Malta merged with Tagliaferro Bank through an exchange of shares. In 1973, following a run on the National Bank of Malta and its subsidiary Tagliaferro Bank, the Maltese government after Parliament passed the &#x27;National and Tagliaferro Banks (Temporary Provision) Act 1973&#x27;. The run on the bank is widely considered to have been orchestrated by the then government in an attempt to take control of the banking sector in Malta. On 22 March 1974 the Prime Minister Dom Mintoff announced the setting up of the Bank of Valletta. The new Bank took over the assets and liabilities of the National Bank of Malta, and commenced operations on 25 March 1974. The banking reform was described as a &quot;hijack&quot; by Adrain Busietta, as it created a number of controversies for those who had assets. The National Bank&#x27;s liabilities were artificially inflated by 151% by the government in an attempt to make it appear as insolvent.

The Government, injected Lm3.3 million (equivalent to €7.7 million) into the new Bank in return for a 60 percent share of the capital. The Malta Development Corporation took up the remaining 40 percent, and in time sold 20 percent to the Banco di Sicilia and 10 percent to the Maltese public. In 1986, the Bank inaugurated its first overseas representative office.

In 1990, the Maltese government reduced its stake in Bank to 51 percent by issuing and offering 4.9 million shares to the public. That same year Bank of Valletta launched its fully owned investment bank - the subsidiary Valletta Investment Bank.

In 1992, Bank of Valletta International started operating. This wholly owned international banking subsidiary of the Bank of Valletta Group was Malta&#x27;s first Offshore Bank. That same year Bank of Valletta became the first bank to be listed on the Malta Stock Exchange.

In 1995, Bank of Valletta and Insight Investment Management Limited established the Valletta Fund Management.

In September 2000, BOV set up its stockbroking arm, BOV Stockbrokers Limited (&quot;BOVSL&quot;). In time, Bank of Valletta amalgamated Bank of Valletta International Limited, Valletta Investment Bank Limited, Card Services Limited, and BOVSL.

Bank of Valletta continued to evolve its internationalisation through the opening of other representative offices in the Euro-Mediterranean region, though it closed the representative offices in Cairo and Tunis in 2011. With Malta&#x27;s accession into the European Union, Bank of Valletta has become an active member of the European Savings Banks Group.

On 9 January 2014, a Maltese court found that the shareholders of the National Bank of Malta had suffered human rights abuses when the government of Malta had in 1975 forced them to sign away their shares for zero compensation. On 6 February 2014, a Maltese court again found that shareholders of the National Bank of Malta had their rights violated when their assets were taken by the Government of Malta. The government of Malta appealed these decisions, both the Constitutional Court of Malta has now confirmed the judgements of the previous courts. Shareholders will be able to negotiate a compensation package that is likely to involve Bank of Valletta shares.

== Shareholding ==
In 1992, the Bank became the first public company to be listed on the Malta Stock Exchange. Presently, 25% of the Bank&#x27;s equity is held by the Government of Malta, UniCredit S.p.A. holds 10.20% and the remaining 64.80% is in the hands of the general public.

<text>Randi Joyce Robertson (née Bueten; born January 28, 1958), better known by her air name Randi Rhodes, is an American progressive political commentator, activist and talk radio host. &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; is live streamed having been previously broadcast nationally on Air America Radio, Nova M Radio, and Premiere Radio Networks.

==Early life==
Rhodes was born Randi Joyce Bueten in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. Randi grew up in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City, her father was a mechanical engineer and World War II veteran and her mother was a dress shop worker; they divorced by the time Rhodes was 15 years old.

Rhodes has described her adolescence as mischievous and cites it as why she enlisted in the United States Air Force. Her married name is Randi Robertson.

Rhodes is a radio name chosen to honor Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s guitar player Randy Rhoads, whom Rhodes describes as &quot;a consummate professional ... but he always practiced. I mean, he practiced eight hours a day. He lived to be the best.&quot;

==Military experience==

Rhodes enlisted in the United States Air Force and worked stateside at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey as an aircraft mechanic, achieving the rank of Airman first class (E-3). She served two years in the Air Force and one year in the reserves. Rhodes went through basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. From there she went to Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas, and was being trained as a flight engineer.

After she transferred to what would be her permanent station in New Jersey, she decided to leave the active-duty Air Force through the Palace Chase program and was honorably discharged after three years service (two active duty and one reserve) at the age of 21.

In the 1980 presidential election, Rhodes voted for Republican candidate Ronald Reagan, explaining: &quot;I was young and stupid and sick of the gas lines&quot;, but never voted Republican again.

==Radio career==
===Early work===
Rhodes&#x27; radio career began in Seminole, Texas at a country music station. Her next job was in a larger market, Mobile, Alabama. While in Mobile, she was paired briefly with a male DJ (also named Randy) for the &quot;Randy and Randi&quot; morning show. This was her first experience with extemporaneous dialogue other than reading cue cards between records. She used this experience as a spring-board to larger markets. In the late 1980s, she was hired out of that medium market directly to New York City by WAPP &quot;The Apple&quot;, owned at the time by Doubleday Broadcasting. While working for WAPP, she took the name &quot;Randi Rhodes,&quot; having previously used &quot;Randi St. John&quot;.

While teaming with host Perry Stone at Milwaukee&#x27;s WQFM, Rhodes was suspended in 1987 when their program offended the gay community and led several businesses to cancel ads.

In late September 1992, Rhodes started on WIOD in Miami, working the 8P-11P night shift. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; described her as &quot;a chain-smoking bottle blond, ... part Joan Rivers, part shock jock Howard Stern and part &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;Coffee Talk&#x27; lady. But mostly, she&#x27;s her rude, crude, loud, brazen, gleeful self.&quot;

===Air America Radio (2004–2008)===

In 2004, Rhodes joined Air America Radio, bringing &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; to a national audience for the first time. Rhodes&#x27; show on Air America consisted principally of monologue and listener calls, with a short comedic segment at the beginning of the show&#x27;s second and third hours. Only occasionally did she do interviews. The show was punctuated with musical interludes, including the show&#x27;s unofficial theme song, &quot;Pain&quot; by Stereomud. On Fridays, Rhodes opened the show with the song &quot;Bounce Your Boobies&quot; by Rusty Warren. With her distinctive Brooklyn-Queens accent, she would take calls spanning the political spectrum, aggressively promoting her views.

In 2007, Rhodes was recognized by the radio industry&#x27;s well known periodical, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; as Woman of the Year.

====Reports of mugging====
In October 2007, rumors of Rhodes having been mugged in New York were fueled by Air America host Jon Elliott, who had said she was attacked at 39th and Park Avenue while walking her dog, Simon on October 14. Elliott also said Rhodes lost several teeth, and speculated the attack could have been part of a right-wing conspiracy.

On October 17, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reported Rhodes never filed a police report, nor did she claim to be the victim of a mugging. Rhodes&#x27; attorney confirmed Rhodes was injured in a fall while walking her dog, and said Rhodes wasn&#x27;t sure how it had happened. Elliott issued an apology for his on-air comments.

====Departure from Air America====
Air America suspended Rhodes from the network on April 3, 2008, after an event in San Francisco for Air America affiliate KKGN. While doing a stand-up comedy act, Rhodes said on March 22, 2008:&quot;Geraldine Ferraro turned out to be the David Duke in drag ... What a whore Geraldine Ferraro is! She&#x27;s such a fucking whore! I wanna see her have to stand beside her husband at one of those mandatory &#x27;I have sinned against you; I&#x27;m a whore&#x27; kind of a press conference. Mr. Ferraro should have to stand next to his whore of a wife ... Hillary is a big fucking whore, too. You know why she&#x27;s a big fucking whore? Because her deal is always, &#x27;Read the fine print, asshole!&#x27;&quot;

When a video of the event was made public the following week, Air America suspended her for &quot;inappropriate comments&quot;. The event was billed as &quot;An Evening with Randi Rhodes&quot; and promoted on KKGN&#x27;s website. Geraldine Ferraro called for Rhodes&#x27; employment to be terminated when the personal attacks directed towards her and Clinton began circulating through the media.

Rhodes claimed that Air America breached its contract with her, and questioned the network&#x27;s commitment to free speech.

On April 10, 2008, Rhodes went on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to clarify her suspension from the network. Later that evening, she conducted an interview on &quot;The Mike Malloy Show&quot; in which Rhodes went into greater detail concerning the suspension. Air America had recently been sold. The new owner read her existing contract and wanted to amend two details: Rhodes&#x27; right to terminate at any time, and a clause that said Air America could not terminate Rhodes for any reason without paying her. Rhodes refused to amend the contract, which she said took &quot;seven months to negotiate with the previous owners.&quot;

Air America suspended her until a settlement could be reached concerning the contract which was still in place and had an additional year to run. In the interim, Air America management decided to conduct market research to assess her value to the company. According to Rhodes, it was Air America which released the press release that called attention to the video of her performance in San Francisco simply as a way to gauge her audience loyalty and her value to the network. She also claimed Air America soon asked her to return to the air, with an offer of more money but still holding to the condition that she had to change her contract &quot;in order to get her mic back&quot;. Rhodes refused and left Air America because of the stalemate over the new contract.

Mark Green, President of Air America Radio, said, &quot;Her abusive, obscene comments obviously crossed the line of what talent at a media company could say,&quot; and added that the comments &quot;were in the Imus league&quot;, referring to radio host Don Imus, who was fired by CBS Radio in 2007 after making racial remarks about female basketball players. According to a published account, Green said the company had asked Rhodes to apologize for the remarks. In the same account, Rhodes said she did not refuse to apologize for the comment.

Air America Media informed Rhodes on April 9 that the contract was terminated. Air America president Mark Green issued a statement wishing Rhodes well, and thanking her for her work with Air America. Meanwhile, KKGN announced on its website that &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; would return to Green 960 as of April 14, 2008.

Air America also terminated access to &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; web site, redirecting it to a statement by the chairman and president on the Air America site. Rhodes stated at 3:42pm, EDT on April 14 that she, not Air America, owns the URL name. The message board was reinstated on May 5, 2008.

===Nova M Radio (2008–2009)===
On April 10, 2008, Nova M Radio announced Rhodes would join its radio network, which also syndicated &quot;The Mike Malloy Show&quot;. During the show&#x27;s first Nova M broadcast on April 14, 2008, Rhodes went into detail concerning the events surrounding her suspension. She described what happened as &quot;a great radio story and I&#x27;ve heard some great radio stories in my day.&quot; The Randi Rhodes show returned to the airwaves on April 21, 2008, on 23 affiliate stations, compared to Air America&#x27;s 60 affiliates. As of May 5, 2008, the show was heard on 28 stations, including XM 167.

On her program&#x27;s inaugural Nova M Radio broadcast she also said that she had objected to Air America&#x27;s new owners demanding her contract be amended to remove her walk-away clause. She said her salary was also an issue.

Rhodes&#x27; last show on Nova M was February 3, 2009. Political commentator and one-time Congressional candidate Nancy Skinner hosted the show in Rhodes&#x27; absence beginning February 5.

Following this, Anita Drobny of Nova M Radio posted a message on the Nova M site saying that they were unable to disclose details of what was going on due to Rhodes&#x27; having complete control of the show and that Rhodes &quot;now has to make her decisions as to what she must do with her career&quot;. Drobny also said, &quot;&quot;People are saying it&#x27;s about money. It&#x27;s not about money at all. I just could not fulfill one of her requirements.&quot; She did, however, note the financial impact of Rhodes&#x27; departure: &quot;I looked at [our] site, and I see that because Randi Rhodes isn&#x27;t on, there are so many people leaving the Founders Club [which involved a fee that was paid to Nova M]. And you can&#x27;t operate without people&#x27;s participation.&quot;&quot;

Additionally, Rhodes&#x27; own website was taken down and replaced with a letter from Rhodes to her supporters stating that the entire situation was within Nova M&#x27;s control and any implication that Rhodes was responsible for the disruption was false, and that Rhodes&#x27; show would be &quot;seeking a new home&quot; in light of those developments.

According to an individual familiar with the issue, Nova M agreed to provide certain standard legal protections for the popular radio host, but Rhodes had to leave the air and discovered that Nova M had not lived up to its contractual promise. Subsequently, on February 19, 2009, Nova M Radio announced that it would be filing for bankruptcy liquidation. The Nova M Radio website was taken down in April 2009.

===Premiere Radio Networks (2009–2014)===
On April 23, 2009, Premiere Radio Networks, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications, announced the addition of Randi Rhodes to their syndicated lineup with her show returning to airways across the country May 11, 2009. Her eponymous program, &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot;, aired live Monday through Friday from 3pm to 6pm Eastern Time. Her show ended on May 16, 2014.

===Dark Horse Broadcasting (2016)===
In 2016, Randi Rhodes initiated a Kickstarter campaign to return &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; from which she received 1,951 pledges in the amount of $152,063. The show began live streaming publicly on July 5, 2016, four days after it was streamed privately to supporters of the Kickstarter campaign.

<text>Sir Charles Wyville Thomson (5 March 1830 – 10 March 1882) was a Scottish natural historian and marine zoologist. He served as the chief scientist on the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition; his work there revolutionized oceanography and led to his being knighted.

==Life==
Thomson was born at Bonsyde, in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830, the son of Andrew Thomson, a surgeon in the service of the East India Company, and his wife Sarah Ann Drummond Smith. He was baptised Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson, but changed his name formally upon being knighted in 1876.

He was educated under Charles Chalmers at Merchiston Castle School, then from 1845 studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating with an MD. However, his focus turned from medicine to natural science, and he joined the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1847, and soon after became secretary to the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. In 1850 he was attending the botany class of John Hutton Balfour at the University.

In 1850 he was appointed lecturer of botany, and in 1851 professor of botany, at the University of Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a professor of natural history in Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the chair of mineralogy and geology at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast.

In 1855 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being his former tutor, John Hutton Balfour. He served as the society&#x27;s vice president from 1877 to 1882. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1869.

In 1860 was transferred to the chair of natural history at the same institution. In 1868 he assumed the duties of professor of botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the natural history chair at the University of Edinburgh. Here he taught Arthur Conan Doyle.

In 1871–72 he served as President of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.

==Interests==
Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of the dredgings of Michael Sars in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of and for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. They showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in &quot;The Depths of the Sea&quot;, which he published in 1873.

==Challenger expedition==
The remarkable hydrographic and zoological results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of for a global expedition. Wyville Thomson was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872.

==Aftermath==
The &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition was deemed a great success, and on his return Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he published in two volumes &quot;The Voyage of the ChallengerThe Atlantic&quot;, a preliminary account of the results of the voyage. He spent the next two years working on administrative duties connected with the publication of the full monograph of the voyage. Thomson had a highly strung mentality, and his health was generally poor throughout his life. He found dealing with publishers in the course of completing the full reports of the voyage to be enormously stressful. In 1879 he ceased to perform his university duties, gave up overseeing the reports of the expedition in 1881 (after publishing the introduction to the zoological series in 1880), then took to his bed and died a broken man at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882. Thomson&#x27;s friend and colleague Sir John Murray took over the publication of the reports; they eventually spanned 50 volumes, the last of which was issued in 1895.

Thomson is commemorated in the stained glass window above the altar in St. Michael&#x27;s Parish Church, Linlithgow and his headstone is in the churchyard. In addition the Wyville Thomson Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean is named after him.

==Evolution==
Thomson had criticised natural selection, stating it was not enough to explain the evolution of species. Replying in the &quot;Nature&quot; journal, Charles Darwin commented that &quot;I am sorry to find that Sir Wyville Thomson does not under stand the principle of natural selection, as explained by Mr. Wallace and myself... Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection?&quot;

==Family==
In 1853 he married Jane Ramage Dawson. They were parents to Frank Wyville Thomson (1860–1918).

== Taxon named in his honor ==
The Pallid sculpin, &quot;Cottunculus thomsonii&quot; (Günther, 1882) is named after him.

<doc id="983091" wikidata="Q1145899" url="?curid=983091" title="Curved Air">
<text>Curved Air are an English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band is a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke into the Top 20 in the UK Albums Chart, and had a hit single with &quot;Back Street Luv&quot; (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Band history==
===Sisyphus===
The group evolved out of the band Sisyphus, who played one of their early gigs in the ballroom of Leith Hill Place, Surrey for a masked ball and which was formed by Darryl Way (who studied violin at Dartington College and the Royal College of Music) and Francis Monkman, a member of the Royal Academy of Music. While wandering through an outlet store of the Orange Music Electronic Company, Monkman was intrigued by the sound of Way testing his first electrically amplified violin, and the two &quot;got to talking.&quot; They discovered they had a lot in common, and in 1969 invited pianist Nick Simon who, along with bassist Rob Martin and drummer Florian Pilkington-Miksa, completed the line-up of Sisyphus. &quot;Darryl and Nick were very much into Spirit. One could cite them as a formative influence for Curved Air&quot;, Monkman later remembered. Many of the early Curved Air songs were written for Sisyphus, among them &quot;Young Mother in Style&quot; and &quot;Screw&quot;.

Sisyphus was hired to provide accompaniment for Galt MacDermot&#x27;s new play, &quot;Who the Murderer Was&quot;, at the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill Gate, serving as the pit band. Mark Hanau, an aspiring band manager at the time, saw the show and decided he wanted to manage Sisyphus. He felt that Sonja Kristina, an aspiring folk musician who he had seen in the London stage production of &quot;Hair&quot;, was the missing ingredient in the group. On 1 January 1970, Hanau contacted her through the singer and impresario Roy Guest. She listened to a cassette of the band&#x27;s music and was impressed. With Kristina&#x27;s joining and Nick Simon&#x27;s departure, Sisyphus metamorphosed into Curved Air, named after the album &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; by contemporary composer Terry Riley. The name was suggested by Monkman who, having played in the first London performance of &quot;In C&quot;, was a great fan of Riley. The band&#x27;s new sound immediately came together, and the five-piece Curved Air was born, Sonja Kristina being both the band&#x27;s voice and its sex symbol.

===From formation to first breakup===

After a series of intensive rehearsals in Martin&#x27;s family home in Gloucestershire, the five-piece launched a well-received UK tour, supporting Black Sabbath at one point. The band toured with their own sound engineer, Shaun Davies (later the producer for Way&#x27;s post-Curved Air band, Wolf), which allowed them to achieve a better on-stage sound mix than other groups with unusual combinations of instruments. Shaun&#x27;s father, Guy Davies, made the perspex violins used by Way and later Jobson. Curved Air publicist Tony Brainsby fanned the enthusiastic audience response and a bidding war for the band ensued, and in summer 1970 Curved Air signed with Warner Bros., becoming the first British band on the company&#x27;s roster. The band received a much-publicized advance of £100,000 and their debut album &quot;Air Conditioning&quot; was released in November notable for its being issued as the first commercially available LP picture disc in the UK. The album reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart, preceded by a single, &quot;It Happened Today&quot;. John Peel picked up on the band and they performed on several Peel radio Sessions and Roundhouse ‘Implosion’ events. 
Bass player Rob Martin left due to a hand injury, and was replaced by Ian Eyre. The band released &quot;Back Street Luv&quot; which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart to become the band&#x27;s most successful single to date. The &quot;Second Album&quot; peaked at number 11. A non-LP follow-up single, &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Concern&quot;, went by unnoticed.

The band played three U.S. tours and built a cult following there. In the course of constant touring drummer Pilkington-Miksa became ill in late 1971 and, for several months, Barry de Souza, who band members knew from studio work, sat in for him. It was de Souza who played with Curved Air at the 1971 &quot;Beat Club&quot; German TV performance of &quot;Back Street Luv&quot;, the televised version of which became well known. In late 1971, Sonja Kristina joined Faces, Soft Machine, Marc Bolan and David Bedford to do a Christmas radio show for the BBC.

One highlighted performance was on 7 May 1971 when Curved Air was the opening act for B.B. King and Johnny Winter at the Warehouse in New Orleans.

By the time of the third album&#x27;s release, serious musical differences within the band emerged. According to Sonja Kristina&#x27;s Cherry Red interview (2007), Francis was fascinated with overtones and natural harmonies, and &quot;His other obsession is/was jamming... real &#x27;out there&#x27; cosmic rock jamming. And that is not Darryl at all... He&#x27;s a very disciplined perfectionist, he likes things to be as precise and exquisite as possible. Whereas Francis is completely the opposite way; he just wants to play and things just come out of the cosmos&quot;. As Monkman explained,Basically Darryl and I respect each others&#x27; work, but we don&#x27;t really see eye-to-eye on most things. And we never really got the co-writing thing together. I wanted to get my first &quot;epic&quot; together, so it looks like a split forming at the time of the &quot;Second Album&quot;. In fact, the centre was never really solid after Rob left.

This division was reflected in the arrangement of tracks on &quot;Second Album&quot; and &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;; side A of both albums was occupied by music composed by Darryl Way, while side B was devoted solely to Monkman&#x27;s compositions, with no true collaboration between the two writers. While working in the studio the band was in a dire condition. &quot;I remember the moment when Clifford Davis, our manager after Mark Hanau, spelled out what we were going to have to do just to get somewhere near even. We felt burned out&quot;, Monkman later said. By the end of 1972 Monkman was a self-admitted &quot;nervous wreck&quot; and on the verge of physical and mental breakdown. He had to wear earplugs to go on the London Underground and went to a naturopath three times a week.

&quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; was recorded with bassist/guitarist Mike Wedgwood, who replaced Eyre. The album&#x27;s title was drawn from the Lewis Carroll poem of the same title. The album came out in April 1972 and reached number 20 in the UK Albums Chart.

Curved Air split up, Way formed Darryl Way&#x27;s Wolf, Pilkington-Miksa joined Kiki Dee&#x27;s band, and Monkman moved into session work and was later to play in, among others, the supergroup Sky.

===The new Curved Air===
Having retained a good working relationship, Sonja Kristina and Mike Wedgwood formed a new band with Kirby Gregory (electric guitar), Eddie Jobson (keyboards, violin), and Jim Russell (drums). Jobson had come from a band called Fat Grapple, who had been one of Curved Air&#x27;s support acts on tour. The new musicians brought more direct rock energy, with young prodigy Eddie Jobson, influenced by Curved Air, kept the classical blend strongly in the mix. On the suggestion of manager Clifford Davis, they continued using the name Curved Air with the approval and support of the departing band members.

Kristina later commented:&quot;What I wanted to do with the band at the time was get more of a rock edge to it, and Kirby&#x27;s guitar playing really excited me – he was just really wild. And Jim was the same way, a very solid rock drummer. Mike and I really wanted to continue, and it was our manager Clifford Davis who said we would do a better business continuing to call the band Curved Air. So we kept the name and followed along the same pattern as before, as a writer&#x27;s band. Everybody in the new band contributed material except for Jim Russell, who really wasn&#x27;t a writer. Before it had mainly been Darryl and Francis, but I had managed to get some of my compositions in.&quot;
Whereas all three of the original Curved Air&#x27;s albums had broken the UK top 20, the new band&#x27;s sole album, &quot;Air Cut&quot;, failed to chart at the time.

Not long after the release, Eddie Jobson was asked to replace Brian Eno in Roxy Music, so Kirby Gregory and Jim Russell both left the group to form Stretch. Sonja Kristina recorded a demo tape for Warner Brothers but they discontinued the contract. (These demos were later issued as part of the &quot;Lovechild&quot; record). Mike Wedgwood joined Caravan.

===Reunion===
In 1974 Chrysalis sued the band. &quot;We had broken their contract on the advice of Clifford Davis, who said we could prove that they had not been acting in our best interests, but by then he was no longer our manager!&quot; Monkman explained. In order to discharge an enormous unpaid VAT bill, in September 1974 the band&#x27;s mainstays (Kristina, Way, Monkman, and Pilkington-Miksa) reunited for a three-week tour of the UK, put together by Darryl Way&#x27;s manager, Miles Copeland III. The reunion interrupted Way&#x27;s new band, Stark Naked and the Car Thieves, and since the bass slot for Curved Air needed filling, Way brought along the new band&#x27;s bassist, Phil Kohn.

The reunion tour saw Sonja Kristina play her role as Curved Air&#x27;s sex symbol far more dramatically than she had before. Between the band&#x27;s previous breakup and the reunion tour she had worked as a croupier at the London Playboy Club and returned to the stage with Curved Air in see through lace, feathers and beads, highlighting her sexuality.

A live album and single were recorded during the lauded three week reunion tour, and they succeeded in paying off the tax bill. With their debts paid, Monkman and Pilkington-Miksa had no more reason to remain in the band. And so, Curved Air broke up for the third time in as many years.

===Stark Naked, the Car Thieves, and Curved Air===
However, Darryl Way wanted to continue Curved Air with Sonja Kristina. Way brought in two more &quot;Car Thieves&quot;, guitarist Mick Jacques and drummer Stewart Copeland, Miles Copeland III&#x27;s brother. Now more members of this new lineup came from Stark Naked and the Car Thieves than Curved Air . With Darryl Way at the helm, this new band often employed the same classical and folk influences as the original band and played the now classic Curved Air songs at their shows), but their core sound was rooted in pop, rhythm and blues, and hard rock. Miles Copeland III, still serving as Curved Air&#x27;s manager, put the group on his own label, BTM.

The band kicked off with a European tour, which started poorly. Way, a notorious perfectionist, grew impatient with the struggling of his bandmates, especially novice drummer Copeland. Eventually, the musicians found a way of working together and became a popular live act.

The group struggled with studio work. Phil Kohn left and the band, unable to replace him in time for the sessions for &quot;Midnight Wire&quot;, relied on guest musicians to play both bass (John G Perry) and keyboards (Peter Wood). Norma Tager, a friend of Kristina&#x27;s, penned the lyrics to the &quot;Midnight Wire&quot; songs. Kohn was later replaced by Tony Reeves, formerly of Colosseum and Greenslade, but the recording sessions for both &quot;Midnight Wire&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;Airborne&quot; were expensive and highly stressful for everyone involved. Both albums – as well as &quot;Desiree&quot;, a single drawn from &quot;Airborne&quot; – failed to break the charts.
Citing dissatisfaction with BTM Records&#x27; inability to support Curved Air financially, Way departed. Though Alex Richman from the Butts Band stepped in on keyboards, the loss of the band&#x27;s de facto leader was a blow. This line-up&#x27;s final release was a cover version of &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go” and although the shows were sold out and always successful the new recordings did not chart. After months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by Sonja Kristina&#x27;s recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band&#x27;s absence as a &quot;sabbatical&quot;. Copeland formed The Police, Reeves returned to work as a producer and played in semi-pro band Big Chief along with Jacques, and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the romantic relationship they had formed while bandmates and were married in 1982.

===Interim===
Curved Air as a group were largely inactive for the next three decades, though a handful of retrospective releases and compilations were released during this time. (Warner Bros. Records released the band&#x27;s first compilation, &quot;The Best of Curved Air&quot;, in April 1976, though it naturally only contained material from the band&#x27;s four Warner Bros. albums.)

In 1984, Darryl Way asked Sonja Kristina to provide vocals to several of his solo recordings, two of which, &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Only Human&quot;, were released as a single under the Curved Air name. A third track, a cover of &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, was released as a Sonja Kristina solo track on the b-side to &quot;Walk on By&quot;, but was withdrawn due to objections from the Carl Orff estate. Yet another track, &quot;As Long as There&#x27;s a Spark&quot;, was originally recorded by Way and Kristina, but released as a Darryl Way solo track, with Way performing the vocals himself. Way and Kristina followed these recordings with a short tour in 1988, again under the Curved Air name.

In 1990 the original Kristina, Way, Monkman and Pilkington-Miksa quartet gave a one-off reunion concert at the London&#x27;s Town &amp; Country, supported by Noden&#x27;s Ictus. The performance, recorded by Francis Monkman, was captured on the &quot;Alive, 1990&quot; album, released in 2000.

Following the one-off reunion, guitarist Mike Gore instigated a series of jam sessions which involved three fifths of Curved Air&#x27;s original lineup: Monkman, Pilkington-Miksa, and Martin. In 1991 several of these jams were recorded, ultimately being released as a Monkman solo album called &quot;Jam&quot; in 2002.

===2008 onwards===
In early 2008, the band regrouped. On 4 May 2008, in a message to the Curved Air Yahoo Group, Kristina advised that the new line-up would be herself, Darryl Way (violin), Florian Pilkington-Miksa (drums), Andy Christie (guitar) and Chris Harris (bass). Francis Monkman, who was originally pictured with Kristina, Way and Pilkington-Miksa for the reunion, left the project. &quot;Unfortunately, he didn&#x27;t have the same vision as the rest of us as to how (the new project) should be approached and wasn&#x27;t prepared to compromise, so our ways had to part&quot;, commented Way. Sonja Kristina confirmed, &quot;Francis was in at the beginning but had extremely different ideas from Darryl about how he wanted this new Curved Air to prepare and develop. Eventually, he withdrew. We continued with Darryl as our musical director and producer.&quot; The new line-up played in Southern England, Italy and Malta in 2008.

In 2008 a CD/box set &quot;Reborn&quot; was released, with 12 re-recorded Curved Air tracks and two new songs (&quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;The Fury&quot;). Two of the oldies, &quot;Melinda&quot; and &quot;Elfin Boy&quot;, were reworked and produced by Marvin Ayres. As Way explained, the band had two reasons for this: they were never satisfied with the way those tracks were originally recorded and they wanted to have the product that they owned and were in control of. &quot;Reborn was our way of preparing for the live work&quot;, Sonja Kristina added. On Friday, 13 June, Curved Air performed at the Isle of Wight Festival to a generally positive response.

For the 2009 dates in Japan on 16 and 17 January at Club Citta, Kawasaki, the guitarist was Kit Morgan who replaced Christie. On 9 August 2009, Eddie Jobson stood in for Darryl Way at a one-off gig in Chislehurst.

A live album consisting of recordings from the previous UK tour, &quot;Live Atmosphere&quot;, was released on 2 April 2012.

Way was indisposed for their dates in October 2009 and Robert Norton (keyboards) and Paul Sax (violin) stood in for him. Sax had played on Sonja Kristina&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Songs from The Acid Folk&quot; and both Sax and Norton played on her 1995 album &quot;Harmonics of Love&quot;. &quot;Robert Norton is exceptional – as is Paul Sax, a master violinist – one of the first entrants to the Yehudi Menuhin school – a passionate and brave performer very well qualified to step into Darryl&#x27;s light ... Chris Harris is literally our root on bass and Kit Morgan the fire on guitar. Great chemistry and communication,&quot; Sonja Kristina commented. This lineup (Kristina, Pilkington-Miksa, Harris, Morgan, Sax and Norton) continued to gig as Curved Air until 2013. The band played at the London High Voltage Festival 2011 (23–24 July), alongside Spock&#x27;s Beard, Jethro Tull, Dream Theater, and Queensrÿche, among others.

In October 2013, Kirby Gregory returned to replace Kit Morgan on guitar. The new lineup (Kristina, Pilkington-Miksa, Harris, Gregory, Sax and Norton) initially played a couple of dates in the UK before recording a new studio album, &quot;North Star&quot;, released on 17 March 2014, supported by a 10-date tour from 1 March to 19 April with the Acoustic Strawbs and Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash.

On 4 September 2015, Curved Air played a special concert at Under The Bridge, London, to mark the 45th Anniversary of the release of &quot;Air Conditioning&quot;. The album was played in full for the first time. The band was joined on stage by Darryl Way for &quot;Vivaldi&quot; and two other songs. Ian Eyre also played bass during &quot;Back Street Luv&quot;.

Kit Morgan returned to the band in November 2016, replacing Kirby Gregory, but left in August 2018 because of problems with his back, so former Purson guitarist George Hudson made his live debut with the band at The New Day Festival in Kent. Florian Pilkington-Miksa left in November 2017 and was replaced by Andy Tween.

In 2019, Kirby Gregory returned on guitar in place of Hudson, and Grzegorz Gadziomski replaced Paul Sax on violin, both playing with the band at London&#x27;s 100 Club on 17 October.

<doc id="983097" wikidata="Q575008" url="?curid=983097" title="Hofjes in Haarlem">
<text>Haarlem is one of the cities in the Netherlands that has a number of hofjes. Some of them are still in use with boards of regents. Many of these are members of the &quot;Stichting Haarlemse Hofjes&quot; (Foundation Hofjes of Haarlem). The word &#x27;hofje&#x27; just means small garden, because the hofjes are generally small houses grouped around a community kitchen garden with a water pump. Often they were attached to a larger field for bleaching linen or growing orchards, but today those fields have been long used for city expansion and only the central gardens can still be seen.

==Early hospitals==
What we would call &#x27;social work&#x27; today was called charity work in earlier centuries. Hofjes in Haarlem are the remnants of charity work that were founded by defunct community structures that were divided by religious order and social class, but all more or less guided by the then prevailing need to perform the Christian Seven Works of Mercy; feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and free the imprisoned. Committing any of these acts would gain the giver entrance through the pearly gates of Heaven. This is what prompted so many wealthy Haarlem citizens to found Hofjes in their name on their death.

In Haarlem the city council became responsible for acts of mercy on a grand scale when the leper colony was founded outside the city walls in the town of Schoten in 1393. For centuries from all over Holland, lepers had to come to Haarlem to get an &quot;attestatie&quot; or proof of leprosy, as a legal permit to beg. Similarly, the Haarlem &quot;Beul&quot;, or city executioner, &quot;freed&quot; prisoners all over the country from Amsterdam to Ghent by chopping their heads off. This led to the Dutch saying &quot;zo brutaal als de beul van Haarlem&quot;, meaning &quot;as brutal as the Haarlem executioner&quot;. This morbid practise was only stopped in the beginning of the seventeenth century. The Haarlem leper colony, Het Dolhuys, still exists and is currently a museum.

In 1347, the first mention of a &#x27;Gasthuys&#x27; is made in Haarlem archives. After the leper colony was founded (in the name of Saint Lazarus), a new gasthuys, in the name of Saint Elisabeth, was built on the Verwulft where the sick were treated that did not need quarantine outside the city walls. This hospital grew until the fire that burned it down. Hofje van Loo was an add-on that survived. The Elisabeth Gasthuys (later called EG) was rebuilt on the location of a former monastery (cellenbroers or minnebroers) in the Groot Heiligland (across the street from the Frans Hals Museum today) where it operated from 1581 to 1971. Originally a church institution, it was now run by Haarlem council members, due to the Protestant Reformation. Since the German occupation of World War II, this hospital is no longer run by the Haarlem council, but still exists and is called the Kennemer Gasthuis today. The former buildings in the Groot Heiligland house a community center and have been converted to homes.

==Management==
The hofjes are managed by five board members called regents. Any community structure in Haarlem, be it a guild or a hofje, had a group of five regents or regentesses. Whenever there was a change of board members, a commemorative painting would be made. In paintings by Frans Hals&#x27; the regents of the Poor men&#x27;s almshouse and the regents of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuys can be seen. Many guilds kept hofjes for their own aging members. When the guilds were disbanded under the French occupation in 1794, the guild regents kept their role as hofje regents, since the hofjes were at that time still quite wealthy. With the tiercering in 1810 however, the lack of revenues from both government bonds and guild membership dues was sorely felt and many hofjes went bankrupt and were disbanded.

==Wealth==
It was the duty of the regents to care for the books and the behavior of the members. Many hofjes were quite wealthy, due to the high turnover of its members, who had to donate all of their possessions to the hofje in order to be accepted for living there. Other sources of income were lotteries, that were organized to build new premises or restore old ones. The living conditions between the various hofjes varied substantially, with each religious order competing to keep the most luxurious one. Today most of the surviving hofjes receive their income from housing rents.

==Origins==
When talking of hofjes, most people refer to the name given to the buildings themselves, but the foundations they are based on may have moved premises several times since the original foundation date, and even changed their names. Hofjes in Haarlem were primarily the result of generous bequests by wealthy men or women in their own name, rather than from any group religious or municipal effort. Most hofjes were meant for elderly women, because there were far more poor aged women in the streets than poor aged men.
However, after the iconoclasm of the Reformation in Haarlem in 1566, the Catholics (and their hofjes) were forced underground, and many became quite poor. When the &#x27;Oudemannenhuis&#x27; opened in 1609, many of the poor men who were accepted were Catholics.

<doc id="983103" wikidata="Q52118" url="?curid=983103" title="Calimera">
<text>Calimera (Griko: &quot;good morning&quot;), is a small town of 6,753 inhabitants (2021) in the Grecìa Salentina area of the Salento peninsula in Italy, located between Gallipoli and Otranto. It belongs to the province of Lecce.

The inhabitants of Calimera, alongside Italian, also speak Griko, a Greek dialect. The language, folklore, traditions and history of Calimera, like those of the eight other cities in the area called &quot;Salentine Greece&quot;, reveal significant Greek influences over the course of time, presumably from the time of the Byzantine control, or even the ancient Magna Graecia colonisation in the 8th century BCE.

In the park, there is a small monument containing an ancient Attic burial stone, given by the city of Athens to Calimera in 1960. At the top of this monument is a motto, referring to the burial stone: &quot;Zeni su en ise ettù sti Kalimera&quot; (in Greek script: Τσένη &#x27;σού &#x27;εν είσαι ετού στη Καλημέρα), meaning &quot;You are not a stranger here in Calimera&quot;, which underlines the close relationship and common origins of Calimera with the rest of Greek civilisation.

==Story of the city&#x27;s name==
The story of the city&#x27;s name starts when immigrants from Greece came and installed there. An italian stranger, who was passing from the city, asks from an inhabitant to tell him the name of the city. The greek human didn&#x27;t understand the language (italian) and so the only thing that he told him was the greek greeting &quot;Calimera&quot; which means &quot;good morning&quot;. The italian, supposing that he answered his question, thought that the name of the city was &quot;Calimera&quot; and so the city took this name!

<doc id="983106" wikidata="Q456516" url="?curid=983106" title="The Four Freshmen">
<text>The Four Freshmen is an American male vocal quartet that blends open-harmonic jazz arrangements with the big band vocal group sounds of The Modernaires, The Pied Pipers, and The Mel-Tones, founded in the barbershop tradition. The singers accompany themselves on guitar, horns, bass, and drums, among other instrumental configurations.

The group was founded in 1948 in Indiana and reached its peak popularity in the mid-1950s. The last original member retired in 1993, but the group continues to tour internationally. It has recorded jazz harmonies since its founding in the late 1940s in the halls of the Jordan School of Music at Butler University in Indianapolis.

==History==
===Early beginnings===
Brothers Don and Ross Barbour grew up in a musical family in Columbus, Indiana, and had sung with their cousin Bob Flanigan as kids. In 1947, while attending the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, music theory classmate Hal Kratzsch convinced the Barbours that forming a barbershop quartet would be a great source of income, so they formed a barbershop quartet called Hal&#x27;s Harmonizers. Kratzsch knew from instinct how to sing the bottom part; Don, with his wide vocal range, was tapped to sing the second part; and Ross, a natural baritone, took the third part. To sing the top part, they recruited classmate Marvin Pruitt. They would perform songs like &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; at fairs and conventions while wearing armbands, exaggerated false mustaches, and waiters&#x27; aprons. Bored with the confinement of barbershop chords, and not wanting to give up their income base, they renamed themselves as the Toppers, and experimented with more complex chords and jazz arrangements. At first, the group was influenced by Glenn Miller&#x27;s quartet, The Modernaires, and Mel Tormé&#x27;s Mel-Tones, but soon developed its own style of improvised vocal harmony.

As the Toppers&#x27; popularity grew, Pruitt developed stage fright and resigned. Initially, they replaced him with Ross&#x27;s girlfriend and future wife Nancy Sue Carson, but feeling that a fourth male voice would be more appropriate for the group&#x27;s sound, the Barbour brothers contacted Flanigan, who was living in Greencastle, Indiana and had previously been part of a high school quintet singing songs inspired by the Modernaires, to become their new lead singer. In the meantime, they started accompanying themselves with musical instruments: Don, having played guitar through high school and a couple of years in Arabia with the Air Force, on guitar; Ross, first on piano, then on drums; Flanigan, who played trombone through his army time in Germany, except when the dance band needed a bass player, alternating between string bass and trombone, and Kratzsch, who played trumpet in high school and in the Navy in the South Pacific, on trumpet, mellophone and string bass. Soon, the group dropped out of school and drove to Chicago, where they met agent Dick Shelton. As he already had a group called the Cottontoppers, he renamed them as the Freshmen Four, which they reversed to the Four Freshmen. They made their debut at Fort Wayne&#x27;s 113 Club on September 20, 1948, and nearly lost the job since the manager had never heard jazz chords, but his daughter had a crush on Kratzsch, allowing them to stay for a week.

===Initial success===
Soon, the Four Freshmen drew the admiration of jazz legends such as Dizzy Gillespie and Woody Herman. On March 21, 1950, Stan Kenton heard the quartet at the Esquire Lounge in Dayton, Ohio. He &quot;had been told at his own show earlier that night about a quartet in town that sounded like his 43-piece ensemble&quot;, and was sufficiently impressed that on April 14, he arranged for an audition with his label, Capitol Records, which signed them later that year. The demo included &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Basin&#x27; Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Dry Bones&quot;, and two other songs. In 1950, they released a single, &quot;Mr. B&#x27;s Blues&quot;, and appeared in their first and only film, &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot;, where they sang &quot;How D&#x27;Ya Like Your Eggs In The Morning&quot; with Jane Powell and Vic Damone. The Freshmen released another single in 1951, &quot;Now You Know&quot;, which was not a commercial success. Later in the year Capitol rejected their proposed next single, &quot;It&#x27;s a Blue World&quot;, and dropped them from the label. In May of the following year, a furious Stan Kenton demanded that the record company send them the demo tapes so that they could promote the song themselves. They managed to get the song onto the radio, and in 1952, &quot;It&#x27;s a Blue World&quot; became their first charted single. Capitol re-signed the group in July of the same year.

In 1953, Hal Kratzsch, now married, grew tired of touring and wanted to return to his hometown in Warsaw, Indiana to settle down. He announced to the others that his intention to leave as soon as a replacement was found. In spring that year, while performing at the Crest Lounge in Detroit, a patron suggested they audition Ken Errair, a friend of his. Errair, a tool and die maker by day, and spent his nights playing &quot;society music&quot; with several bands in the area, had a booming, deep voice and a good ear for harmony. He picked up Kratzsch&#x27;s trumpet and mellophone parts and quickly learned the bass, becoming a full-time Freshman in May 1953. Their single to chart was &quot;It Happened Once Before&quot;, and the year ended with them winning the &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine poll as Best Jazz Vocal Group of 1953.

In 1954, the Freshmen recorded their first album, &quot;Voices in Modern&quot;. &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; and &quot;Day By Day&quot;, singles from this album, charted. The following year, they released &quot;How Can I Tell Her&quot; and &quot;Charmaine&quot;, followed by &quot;Graduation Day&quot; in 1956. The group&#x27;s second album &quot;Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones&quot; &quot;set the standard for modern jazz vocal groups&quot; and reached number 6.

After only a short time with the group, Ken Errair, who had just married Jane Withers, left to settle into his married life in California. While informing his bandmates about his decision to leave, he recommended singer-songwriter and member of the Stuarts, Ken Albers. Errair would release an album on Capitol in 1957, &quot;Solo Session&quot;, before retiring from music to become a successful real estate developer in California. Around this time, the group began to perform at college auditoriums and to pursue a younger audience.

In 1960, the Freshmen recorded &quot;Their Hearts Were Full of Spring&quot;, a song which, with different lyrics, became The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;A Young Man Is Gone&quot; in 1963. The group eventually lost its mainstream following with the advent of the rock bands of the 1960s, even as one of those bands, the Beach Boys, cited the Four Freshmen as one of its main influences. Don Barbour, unhappy with the direction the group had been taking with its material, which was away from the blues and saloon numbers and more toward mainstream pop, left the group on amicable terms in September 1960. He began working on a solo album in June 1961, but before it was released, he was killed in an automobile accident in Hollywood on October 5, 1961. Meanwhile, the group replaced him with Bill Comstock, who had performed with Albers in the Stuarts.

Ken Errair died in a plane crash on June 14, 1968. Two years later, original member Hal Kratzsch died of cancer on October 18, 1970.

===1970s and 1980s===
The lineup of Barbour, Flanigan, Albers and Comstock continued for 13 years, until the end of 1972 when Comstock decided to take time off touring to care for his ailing wife Sue. Ray Brown, a fan of the Four Freshmen since 12 who offered himself as a replacement during a show in Florida, made his debut in March 1973, marking the first time keyboards are featured instead of the guitar. This lineup released the album &quot;Mount Freshmore&quot; in 1977.

In 1977, Ross Barbour retired to go into the real estate business in California, after spending 29 years with the Freshmen. At the same time, Ray Brown also departed, choosing to step away from the road and spend more time with his growing family. Replacing them were Autie Goodman, who had spent 11 years with the Modernaires, and Dennis Grillo, a jazz composer and arranger who worked with numerous bands. Goodman sang the second part and played saxophone and drums, while Grillo sang the third part and played trumpet and flugelhorn. As such, they could carry their own set of horns, an arrangement that lasted until the 1990s.

Ken Albers retired from the group in February 1982. As a result, Dennis Grillo temporarily took over the fourth part, while Mike Beisner, a student under the Stan Kenton Band Clinics, was brought in to sing the third part, as well as to play trumpet, flugelhorn and keyboards. With Grillo leaving a month later to become a professor at the Berklee College of Music, Rod Henley, who led the Hotlanta Jazz Singers and has played together with former Freshman Ray Brown in the Fancy Colors, became his replacement, while playing trumpet, trombone, flugelhorn and keyboards. Henley had previously been offered as a replacement for Comstock as early as 1972 at Brown&#x27;s recommendation, though Brown was selected instead. In 1986, they released the album &quot;Fresh!&quot;, featuring a more modern arrangement as well as covers of 1970s and 1980s hits.

Rod Henley left the Four Freshmen in 1986, his place taken over by Dave Jennings and then Newton Graber. Despite returning briefly in 1987, he soon departed for a second time, and Seattle-based high school teacher Kirk Marcy was recruited as the group&#x27;s bass singer in September that year. In 1988, they made an appearance on &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; with Joan Lunden, where they were joined by Lunden&#x27;s husband-producer Michael A. Krauss on &quot;Day By Day&quot;. In August 1988, Marcy left to become the director of Edmonds College&#x27;s vocal jazz ensemble Soundsation, and was replaced by Garry Lee Rosenberg.

In 1989, Mike Beisner was offered the role of musical director for talk show Everyday with Joan Lunden, resulting in his departure from the group. While he and Flanigan were searching for a replacement, they came across a 1988 demo from a then-39-year-old Greg Stegeman, featuring him singing all four parts and playing keyboards and horns. Stegeman, who was working as music director and disc jockey at KRML, responded to a phone call from Flanigan, resulting in him becoming a fully-fledged member of the Four Freshmen.

While touring with Woody Herman&#x27;s band in 1990, Flanigan suffered from a heart attack and would require heart surgery. With a few weeks left in the tour, Stegeman offered to take the top part, while Beisner temporarily returned following the commercial failure of Lunden&#x27;s talk show. When Flanigan was well enough to resume touring, Stegeman returned to singing the third part while Beisner departed for a second time.

===The 1990s and 50th anniversary special===
In April 1991, Garry Lee Rosenberg left, leaving a permanent opening for Mike Beisner to return, this time singing the bass part. In 1992, both Bob Flanigan and Autie Goodman made the decision to come off the road. Despite the retirement of Flanigan, the last original member, the group did not disband, with Flanigan managing them. Taking their places were Bob Ferreira, a student of former member Kirk Marcy at the Edmonds College who auditioned for the group at Marcy&#x27;s recommendation, and Kevin Stout, a freelance jazz trombonist in Las Vegas. Ferreira handled drums and bass vocals, while Stout played guitar, bass and trombone. As Stout could not sing at the top, he took the third part, with Stegeman taking on the high notes and Beisner singing the second part. Flanigan introduced the new Freshmen lineup at the 1992 Four Freshmen Convention in Columbus, Ohio.

Mike Beisner came off the road for good in 1994. Greg Stegeman, who was then the most senior member, took on more of a leadership role, while Alan MacIntosh joined, singing the second part and playing bass, keyboards, and trumpet. Two years later, MacIntosh discovered that the road did not suit him, so he resigned from the group, with Brian Eichenberger, a 19-year-old guitarist and bassist who was studying jazz arranging and performance under Phil Mattson at the Southwestern Community College&#x27;s School for Music Vocations in Creston, Iowa, recruited to fill his position. Stegeman continued to sing the high part until well after Eichenberger joined, but when it was discovered that the latter possessed a true tenor voice, they ended up swapping parts.

In 1998, the Four Freshmen were featured in a CBS special titled &quot;The Four Freshmen: 50 Years Fresh!&quot;, hosted by Maureen McGovern to commemorate the 50th anniversary since their founding. This special features performances from not only then-current members Greg Stegeman, Kevin Stout, Bob Ferreira and Brian Eichenberger, but also former members Ross Barbour, Bob Flanigan, Bill Comstock and Mike Beisner. Towards the end, both groups came together to perform a reprise of &quot;It&#x27;s A Blue World&quot;, as well as &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Poinciana&quot;, which were not featured in the original broadcast.

Kevin Stout left the group in December 1999 after a seven-year stint, following which he would collaborate regularly with high school friend and saxophonist Brian Booth. In his place was Vince Johnson, who had previously worked as an accompanist, educator and performer, and had performed throughout the world while with Princess Cruises.

===2000s, 2010s and 2020s===
Greg Stegeman retired from the group in 2001, but continued to serve as an advisor to the Four Freshmen Music Foundation. While searching for a replacement, Brian Eichenberger encountered Curtis Calderon performing at The Landing jazz club in San Antonio. Calderon, who had toured with Russ Morgan&#x27;s big band, was tapped to sing the second part and play trumpet and flugelhorn.

Ken Albers died on April 19, 2007, at the age of 82.

Former member Mike Beisner died of natural causes on July 6, 2008, at the age of 53.

Bob Flanigan died on May 15, 2011, at the age of 84 from congestive heart failure. Last original member Ross Barbour died on August 20, 2011, at the age of 82 from cancer.

Dennis Grillo died on October 31, 2011, at the age of 81.

Vince Johnson, who had spent 13 years with the Four Freshmen, decided to leave the group in fall 2013 to explore more opportunities in the field of music. Replacing him was Stein Malvey, who had previously collaborated with Brian Eichenberger on his 2009 solo album &quot;one&quot; under the alias iKE. With Malvey singing the second tenor part and playing guitar, Eichenberger made the bass his primary instrument while Calderon took over the baritone part.

In January 2015, Brian Eichenberger left to tour with the Beach Boys, after spending 18 years with the Four Freshmen. He contacted Phil Mattson, the director of the School for Music Vocations, who recommended Tommy Boynton, then an adjunct professor at his alma mater. Boynton took over the lead voice and played bass.

Former member Bill Comstock died on November 22, 2016, at the age of 92.

In end 2016, Curtis Calderon left the group to spend more time with his growing family. They began searching for a replacement, which ended up being Jon Gaines. Ferreira then sent Gaines charts of the Four Freshmen&#x27;s most popular tunes, six at a time, so that he could learn the third vocal part. This was followed by a week of rehearsals with the other three musicians until he was comfortable enough to go on the road.

Longtime member Autie Goodman died in his sleep on December 20, 2018, at the age of 93.

On February 21 and 22, 2020, the Four Freshmen played two sets at the Dirty Dog Jazz Cafe in Michigan, with Minneapolis-based jazz trumpeter Jake Baldwin in place of Jon Gaines, causing fans to start questioning if Gaines had left the group. In response, the group posted on their social media on April 9, confirming Gaines&#x27;s departure and Baldwin&#x27;s entry as an official member. Baldwin had previously studied alongside Boynton at the New England Conservatory of Music, and was recommended to Ferreira to replace the departing Gaines, who left to tend to his family.

Former member Ray Brown died of complications related to COVID-19 on November 11, 2020, at the age of 81.

Stein Malvey left in November 2020 to pursue other musical ventures, after spending seven years in the group. Tommy Boynton moved to guitar and second part vocals, while bringing in Ryan Howe, a fellow faculty member and graduate of the School for Music Vocations, to sing lead and play bass. This new lineup made its debut in Largo, Florida on November 15. However, following Howe&#x27;s diagnosis with multiple sclerosis that affected the use of his hands, he stopped playing bass with the group starting May 2022, instead they would bring in external musicians to play upright bass with them during their gigs.

==Style==
According to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;:
:The group represented a modernizing force in the sphere of close harmony quartets in American popular music, moving away from the barbershop style to introduce elements of jazz. In doing so, they influenced younger groups such as the Hi-Los and the Beach Boys.

&quot;The Oxford Companion to Popular Music&quot; says:
:They sing with great variety, in quiet unison or full-throated harmony, using modern jazz harmonies and varied dynamics, a considerable advance on the typical close-harmony quartets that had preceded them.

==Influence==
The Four Freshmen were an important influence on Brian Wilson, beginning in the mid-50s. He listened to one of their albums, &quot;Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones&quot;, and it &quot;mesmerized&quot; him. He spoke very highly of it: &quot;&#x27;It brings a feeling of love inside me... That feeling of harmony.&#x27;&quot; Aside from listening to their music, the teenage Wilson made a point of seeing the Four Freshmen perform live: &quot;he made solitary pilgrimages to the resort hotels of Catalina Island to see the Four Freshmen.&quot;

The Four Freshmen are also credited with influencing The Lettermen, The Four Preps and The Manhattan Transfer, among other vocal groups.

The Donald Fagen song &quot;Maxine&quot;, from his 1982 50s-themed album &quot;The Nightfly&quot;, in which Fagen accompanies himself on four-part harmonies, has been described as inspired by the Four Freshmen. The Four Freshmen covered the song on their 1986 album &quot;Fresh!&quot;

==Awards and honors==
The Four Freshmen have won &quot;JazzTimes&quot; magazine&#x27;s Readers Poll for Best Vocal Group multiple years.

The group won &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Readers Poll for Best Vocal Group in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 2000, and 2001.

The Freshmen have been nominated for a Grammy Award six times.

<text>Gerald Hawranik is a lawyer and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 2002 to 2011.

Hawranik studied at the University of Manitoba, earning degrees in law, education and physical education. He was a long-time resident of northeastern Manitoba. He has been a practicing lawyer for over 30 years, and has also been the co-owner of a general insurance agency and an automobile dealership in the area. During the early 1990s, he and his wife were responsible for opening the first rural food bank in Canada in the region. Hawranik is also the founder of &quot;Beauserve Homes, Inc.&quot;, a learning facility for mentally challenged adults.

In 1993, he was named Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

Hawranik was first elected to the legislature in a 2002 by-election in the riding of Lac du Bonnet (following the resignation of Darren Praznik). A Progressive Conservative, Hawranik narrowly defeated New Democrat Michael Hameluck by 3398 votes to 3234. He defeated Hameluck again by a slightly wider margin in the provincial election of 2003.

Hawranik maintains a personal web page, through which he has outlined his views on a variety of issues. He has spoken out in favour of reforming Canada&#x27;s legal system, particularly in light of efforts by the Hells Angels to hire high-priced lawyers at public expense.

He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

In February 2011, Hawranik announced that he would not run for reelection to the assembly later that year. Later in 2011, he moved to Alberta to join his wife who had been serving as dean of the faculty of graduate studies at Athabasca University for the previous two years. Also in 2011, he was named to the Parole Board of Canada. In July 2013, he was named chair and CEO of the Alberta Surface Rights and Land Compensation Board.

<doc id="983117" wikidata="Q8003290" url="?curid=983117" title="Willamette Falls">
<text>The Willamette Falls is a natural waterfall in the northwestern United States, located on the Willamette River between Oregon City and West Linn, Oregon. The largest waterfall in the Northwest U.S. by volume, it is the seventeenth widest in the world. Horseshoe in shape, it is wide and high, with a flow rate of . Located upriver from the Willamette&#x27;s mouth at Portland, Willamette Falls is a culturally significant site for many tribal communities in the region.

Opened in 1873 and closed since 2011, the Willamette Falls Locks allowed boat traffic on the Willamette to pass into the main Willamette Valley.

==History==
Native American oral history taught that the falls were placed there by the ancient hero T&#x27;allapus (Coyote) so that their people would have fish to eat all winter.· Willamette Falls was once the home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla band of Tumwaters or Willamette Band of Tumwaters, an upper Chinookan speaking people. These lands were ceded to the United States Government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 (signed on January 22, 1855; ratified on March 3, 1855). Tribal members were then removed from these ancestral lands to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Indian Reservation.

Willamette Falls is an important location for many tribes. The abundance of salmon brought tribal communities from all over to fish, trade, and interact at the falls - creating an economic and cultural hub for the region. Each year many tribes harvest ceremonial salmon at Willamette Falls and collect lamprey during the summer, including the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.
European fur traders became aware of the falls in 1810. John McLoughlin established a land claim at the falls in the name of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1829. Oregon City was established in 1842 near the east end of the falls. The town of Linn City was founded on the western shore one year later in 1843. The two towns competed economically, vying for the lucrative steamboat traffic and the trade it generated. With the falls representing the end of the line for boat traffic, river boat captains were forced to choose a side of the river on which they would dock to unload their passengers and goods; some of which would continue their upriver journey on winding portage toll roads. Competition between the towns was fierce until the Great Flood of 1862. Oregon City was inundated and badly damaged, while Linn City was obliterated.

===Modifications and industrialization ===
Navigating past the falls was not possible until the completion of the Willamette Falls Locks in 1873. During construction of the locks, channels were blasted from the rocks that formerly supported the town of Linn City. Along with the locks, the city of West Linn sits on a portion of the former town site. The locks were sold by the Willamette Falls Canal and Locks Company to the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1915. They were closed in 2011.

The Willamette Falls Electric Company (later renamed Portland General Electric) was formed in 1888 to build a hydro-electric generation facility at the falls. Four turbine-driven dynamos were built on the east end of the falls. A 14-mile (23-kilometer) long transmission line to Portland was built, becoming the first long-distance transmission of electrical energy in the United States in 1889.

In 1895 Portland General Electric built a second generation station on the west side of the falls. The newer plant, called the T.W.Sullivan Plant (previously Station B), is still in operation with a capacity of 16,000 kilowatts. The foundations of the old plant still remain.

The falls have been home to several paper mills beginning with the Oregon City Paper Manufacturing Co. in 1866. The Willamette Pulp and Paper Co. opened on the West Linn side during 1889. The ownership of the mills has changed several times. The last two remaining mills in 2011 were owned by the West Linn Paper Company and the Blue Heron Paper Company. West Linn Paper Company announced it was shutting down in October 2017, and reopened in November 2019 as Willamette Falls Paper Company. Blue Heron Paper Company closed its mill in February 2011.

The Blue Heron site has subsequently been auctioned off for redevelopment. The milling facilities were sold to a Canadian investment firm, NRI Global, Inc., which has begun work removing the old machinery and cleaning the grounds of contamination. An agreement for the sale of the site itself was announced in June 2013, but later fell apart. In May 2014, another developer, George Heidgerken, purchased the property. Heidgerken then sold the property to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in August 2019.

== Ecology ==

The falls is a horseshoe-shaped, block waterfall caused by a basalt shelf in the river floor. The 40 ft (12 m) high and 1500 ft (457 m) wide falls occur 26 river miles (42 km) upstream from the Willamette&#x27;s confluence with the Columbia River. Operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lock was a four lock canal and was the oldest continuous operating, multiple lift navigation canal in the United States.

The industrialization of the area led to diminishing salmon and steelhead runs, prompting the construction of a fish ladder in 1882. A new fish ladder, built in 1971, is operated by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The estimated spring chinook salmon run for 2007 was 52,000. 

==Access ==

The public can view the falls from viewpoints on the bluffs of Oregon City, from a signed viewpoint along Highway 99E, from the Oregon City Bridge, from a viewpoint on northbound I-205, or from boats in the river.

The industrialization precluded public access to the base of the waterfall for well over a century. As of 2017, a process to redevelop the Blue Heron Paper Mill site and provide public access to the area, including a river walk, is underway. The Willamette Falls Trust is coordinating the Willamette Falls Inter-Tribal Public Access Project that is led by a team that includes Tribal Council Members and appointees from several sovereign nations, including the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs.

<doc id="983123" wikidata="Q214506" url="?curid=983123" title="Insular Celtic languages">
<text>Insular Celtic languages are the group of Celtic languages spoken in Brittany, Great Britain, Ireland, and the Isle of Man. All surviving Celtic languages are in the Insular group, including Breton, which is spoken on continental Europe in Brittany, France. The Continental Celtic languages, although once widely spoken in mainland Europe and in Anatolia, are extinct.

Six Insular Celtic languages are extant (in all cases written and spoken) in two distinct groups:
* Insular Celtic languages
** Brittonic (or Brythonic) languages
*** Breton
*** Cornish
*** Welsh
** Goidelic languages
*** Irish
*** Manx
*** Scottish Gaelic
==Insular Celtic hypothesis==
The Insular Celtic hypothesis is the theory that these languages evolved together in those places, having a later common ancestor than any of the Continental Celtic languages such as Celtiberian, Gaulish, Galatian, and Lepontic, among others, all of which are long extinct. This linguistic division of Celtic languages into Insular and Continental contrasts with the P/Q Celtic hypothesis.

The proponents of the Insular hypothesis (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) point to shared innovations among these – chiefly:

* inflected prepositions
* shared use of certain verbal particles
* VSO word order
* differentiation of absolute and conjunct verb endings as found extensively in Old Irish and less so in Middle Welsh (see Morphology of the Proto-Celtic language).

The proponents assert that a strong partition between the Brittonic languages with Gaulish (P-Celtic) on one side and the Goidelic languages with Celtiberian (Q-Celtic) on the other, may be superficial, owing to a language contact phenomenon. They add the identical sound shift ( to ) could have occurred independently in the predecessors of Gaulish and Brittonic, or have spread through language contact between those two groups. Further, the Italic languages had a similar divergence between Latino-Faliscan, which kept , and Osco-Umbrian, which changed it to . Some historians, such as George Buchanan in the 16th century, had suggested the Brythonic or P-Celtic language was a descendant of the Picts&#x27; language. Indeed, the tribe of the Pritani has Qritani (and, orthographically orthodox in modern form but counterintuitively written Cruthin) (Q-Celtic) cognate forms.

Under the Insular hypothesis, the family tree of the insular Celtic languages is thus as follows:

This table lists cognates showing the development of Proto-Celtic to in Gaulish and the Brittonic languages but to in the Goidelic languages.
: In Welsh orthography denotes or in northern Welsh and or in southern Welsh

A significant difference between Goidelic and Brittonic languages is the transformation of , to a denasalised vowel with lengthening, &quot;é&quot;, before an originally voiceless stop or fricative, Old Irish &quot;death&quot;, &quot;fish hook&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;, &quot;hundred&quot; vs. Welsh , , , and . Otherwise:
* the nasal is retained before a vowel, &quot;i̯&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and a liquid:
** &quot;woman&quot; (&lt; )
** &quot;he/she is born&quot; (&lt; )
** &quot;ignorant&quot; (&lt; )
* the nasal passes to &quot;en&quot; before another &quot;n&quot;:
** &quot;peak&quot; (&lt; ) (vs. Welsh )
** &quot;finds a place&quot; (&lt; ) (vs. Welsh )
* the nasal passes to &quot;in, im&quot; before a voiced stop
** &quot;butter&quot; (vs. Breton , Cornish )
** &quot;nail&quot; (vs. Old Welsh )
** &quot;tongue&quot; (vs. Welsh )
** &quot;strait&quot; (vs. Middle Welsh &quot;wide&quot;)

==Insular Celtic as a language area==
In order to show that shared innovations are from a common descent it is necessary that they do not arise because of language contact after initial separation. A language area can result from widespread bilingualism, perhaps because of exogamy, and absence of sharp sociolinguistic division.

Ranko Matasović has provided a list of changes which affected both branches of Insular Celtic but for which there is no evidence that they should be dated to a putative Proto-Insular Celtic period. These are:

* Phonological Changes
** The lenition of voiceless stops
** Raising/i-affection
** Lowering/a-affection
** Apocope
** Syncope
* Morphological Changes
** Creation of conjugated prepositions
** Loss of case inflection of personal pronouns (historical case-inflected forms)
** Creation of the equative degree
** Creation of the imperfect
** Creation of the conditional mood
* Morphosyntactic and Syntactic
** Rigidisation of VSO order
** Creation of preposed definite articles
** Creation of particles expressing sentence affirmation and negation
** Creation of periphrastic construction
** Creation of object markers
** Use of ordinal numbers in the sense of &quot;one of&quot;.

==Absolute and dependent verb==
The Insular Celtic verb shows a peculiar feature unknown in any other attested Indo-European language: verbs have different conjugational forms depending on whether they appear in absolute initial position in the sentence (Insular Celtic having verb–subject–object or VSO word order) or whether they are preceded by a preverbal particle. The situation is most robustly attested in Old Irish, but it has remained to some extent in Scottish Gaelic and traces of it are present in Middle Welsh as well.

Forms that appear in sentence-initial position are called absolute, those that appear after a particle are called conjunct (see Dependent and independent verb forms for details). The paradigm of the present active indicative of the Old Irish verb &quot;carry&quot; is as follows; the conjunct forms are illustrated with the particle &quot;not&quot;.

In Scottish Gaelic this distinction is still found in certain verb-forms across almost all verbs (except for a very few). This is a VSO language. The example given in the first column below is the &quot;independent &quot; or &quot;absolute &quot; form, which must be used when the verb is in clause-initial position (or preceded in the clause by certain preverbal particles). Then following it is the &quot;dependent &quot; or &quot;conjunct &quot; form which is required when the verb is preceded in the clause by certain other preverbal particles, in particular interrogative or negative preverbal particles. In these examples, in the first column we have a verb in clause-initial position. In the second column a negative particle immediately precedes the verb, which makes the verb use the verb form or verb forms of the &quot;dependent &quot; conjugation.

The verb forms in the above examples happen to be the same with any subject personal pronouns, not just with the particular persons chosen in the example. Also, the combination of tense–aspect–mood properties inherent in these verb forms is non-past but otherwise indefinite with respect to time, being compatible with a variety of non-past times, and context indicates the time. The sense can be completely tenseless, for example when asserting that something is always true or always happens. This verb form has erroneously been termed &#x27;future&#x27; in many pedagogical grammars. A correct, neutral term &#x27;INDEF1&#x27; has been used in linguistics texts.

In Middle Welsh, the distinction is seen most clearly in proverbs following the formula &quot;X happens, Y does not happen&quot; (Evans 1964: 119):
* &quot;The furrows last, he who made them lasts not&quot;
* &quot;Wealth perishes, fame perishes not&quot;
* &quot;An infant grows, his swaddling-clothes grow not&quot;
* &quot;A naked boy plays, a hungry boy plays not&quot;

The older analysis of the distinction, as reported by Thurneysen (1946, 360 ff.), held that the absolute endings derive from Proto-Indo-European &quot;primary endings&quot; (used in present and future tenses) while the conjunct endings derive from the &quot;secondary endings&quot; (used in past tenses). Thus Old Irish absolute &quot;s/he carries&quot; was thought to be from * (compare Sanskrit &quot;s/he carries&quot;), while conjunct was thought to be from * (compare Sanskrit &quot;s/he was carrying&quot;).

Today, however, most Celticists agree that Cowgill (1975), following an idea present already in Pedersen (1913, 340 ff.), found the correct solution to the origin of the absolute/conjunct distinction: an enclitic particle, reconstructed as * after consonants and * after vowels, came in second position in the sentence. If the first word in the sentence was another particle, * came after that and thus before the verb, but if the verb was the first word in the sentence, * was cliticized to it. Under this theory, then, Old Irish absolute comes from Proto-Celtic *, while conjunct comes from *.

The identity of the * particle remains uncertain. Cowgill suggests it might be a semantically degraded form of * &quot;is&quot;, while Schrijver (1994) has argued it is derived from the particle * &quot;and then&quot;, which is attested in Gaulish. Schrijver&#x27;s argument is supported and expanded by Schumacher (2004), who points towards further evidence, viz., typological parallels in non-Celtic languages, and especially a large number of verb forms in all Brythonic languages that contain a particle &quot;-d&quot; (from an older *&quot;-t&quot;).

Continental Celtic languages cannot be shown to have any absolute/conjunct distinction. However, they seem to show only SVO and SOV word orders, as in other Indo-European languages. The absolute/conjunct distinction may thus be an artifact of the VSO word order that arose in Insular Celtic.

== Possible pre-Celtic substratum ==
Insular Celtic, unlike Continental Celtic, shares some structural characteristics with various Afro-Asiatic languages which are rare in other Indo-European languages. These similarities include verb–subject–object word order, singular verbs with plural post-verbal subjects, a genitive construction similar to construct state, prepositions with fused inflected pronouns (&quot;conjugated prepositions&quot; or &quot;prepositional pronouns&quot;), and oblique relatives with pronoun copies. Such resemblances were noted as early as 1621 with regard to Welsh and the Hebrew language.

The hypothesis that the Insular Celtic languages had features from an Afro-Asiatic substratum (Iberian and Berber languages) was first proposed by John Morris-Jones in 1899. The theory has been supported by several linguists since: Henry Jenner (1904); Julius Pokorny (1927); Heinrich Wagner (1959); Orin Gensler (1993); Theo Vennemann (1995); and Ariel Shisha-Halevy (2003).

Others have suggested that rather than the Afro-Asiatic influencing Insular Celtic directly, both groups of languages were influenced by a now lost substrate. This was suggested by Jongeling (2000). Ranko Matasović (2012) likewise argued that the &quot;Insular Celtic languages were subject to strong influences from an unknown, presumably non-Indo-European substratum&quot; and found the syntactic parallelisms between Insular Celtic and Afro-Asiatic languages to be &quot;probably not accidental&quot;. He argued that their similarities arose from &quot;a large linguistic macro-area, encompassing parts of NW Africa, as well as large parts of Western Europe, before the arrival of the speakers of Indo-European, including Celtic&quot;.

The Afro-Asiatic substrate theory, according to Raymond Hickey, &quot;has never found much favour with scholars of the Celtic languages&quot;. The theory was criticised by Kim McCone in 2006, Graham Isaac in 2007, and Steve Hewitt in 2009. Isaac argues that the 20 points identified by Gensler are trivial, dependencies, or vacuous. Thus, he considers the theory to be not just unproven but also wrong. Instead, the similarities between Insular Celtic and Afro-Asiatic could have evolved independently.

<text>The U.S. military issues instructor badges to specially training military personnel who are charged with teaching military recruits the skills they need to perform as members of the U.S. Armed Forces or teach continuing education courses for non-commissioned officers and officers in the military. With the exception of the U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard, these badges are considered temporary military decorations and must be surrendered upon completion of one&#x27;s duty as a military instructor. Because of this, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps award Drill Instructor Ribbons as a permanent decoration to recognize service members who have qualified and performed as military instructors.

==Army Instructor Badges==

The Drill Sergeant Identification Badge is a military badge of the United States Army which was first issued on January 15, 1958. It is also nicknamed the &quot;pumpkin&quot; patch due to its jack-o&#x27;-lantern-like appearance when worn in the non-subdued pin-on version and in the color sew-on version worn before insignia was subdued in the 1950s and 1960s. The badge is presented to any NCO who has completed the Drill Sergeant Course at any U.S. Army Drill Sergeant School, and has been assigned as a drill sergeant at a U.S. Army training command.

The drill sergeant identification badge is worn by all qualified drill sergeants. Each element of the badge has a specific meaning. It consists of 13 stars representing the original colonies. The torch, burning brightly, in the center symbolizes liberty. The snake is derived from the original ”Don’t Tread On Me” serpent on the Gadsden flag, a symbol of American independence during the 18th century. Together with the torch and breastplate, it indicated readiness to defend. The breastplate is a symbol of strength. The green background is a vestment worn under the breastplate. It&#x27;s called a Jupon, which represents the new Army. The snake grasps, with his tail and teeth, a scroll inscribed “This We’ll Defend,” the motto of the United States Army. The inscription summarizes the meaning of all the symbols on the badge, depicting the determination, devotion, and constant readiness of the American soldier.

The Drill Sergeant Identification Badge (non-subdued) is worn on the lower right uniform pocket of the U.S. Army Class A uniform. On the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), the black subdued pin on version is worn centered on the ACU blouse pocket. The badge is authorized for wear upon successful completion of the Drill Sergeant Course. During this tour of duty the Drill Sergeant badge is considered a temporary decoration pending successful completion of the tour as a drill sergeant. The award is authorized by the Commandant of the Drill Sergeant School, and the Drill Sergeant Identification Badge may be worn for the duration of a military member&#x27;s career, including commissioned service. Any drill sergeant who is relieved of drill sergeant duties for cause may be required to surrender the badge and in this case would not eligible for any further display of the decoration.
In June 2014, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) implemented the Army Instructor Identification Badges. These badges are earned by certified noncommissioned officers who work as instructors within the Noncommissioned Officer Education System, but may also be awarded to commissioned officers. The Army Instructor Identification Badge system is designed to be part of the Instructor Development and Recognition Program (IDRP) and come with promotion points for pay grades E-5 and E-6. The introduction of these new badges help to &quot;serve as a foundation on which the Army can promote instructor achievement through personal and professional growth, inspiring others to do the same,&quot; said MSG Elsi Inoa-Santos, IDRP Manager.

The Army Instructor Identification Badges are awarded in three levels; basic, senior, and master. To earn the basic badge a soldier must meet the instructor requirements outlined in Army Regulation 614–200, must complete the requirements of TRADOC Regulation 600–21, must complete 80 hours of instruction as a primary instructor, and must meet evaluation requirements after two separate evaluations 30 days apart. To earn the senior badge a soldier must meet the same requirements as the basic badge and complete the following prerequisites: graduate from the small group instructor training course/intermediate facilitation skills course and the systems approach to training basic course/foundation training developer course. They also must complete 400 hours of instruction as a primary instructor. To earn the master badge a soldier must complete the entire basic and senior badge requirements and complete the following prerequisites: graduate from the advanced facilitator skills course or the faculty development program-1 and the evaluating instructor&#x27;s workshop. They also must meet evaluation requirements and master instructor board requirements outlined in TRADOC Regulation 600–21.

These badges can be worn on the Army Combat Uniform, as a subdued badge or patch, and the full-color versions on Army service uniforms. The Army Instructor Identification Badges are permanent awards and can be worn on Army uniforms for the remainder of a soldier&#x27;s career.

==Air Force Instructor Badges==

The Air Education and Training Instructor Badge is a military badge of the United States Air Force which denotes a service member&#x27;s status as an instructor assigned to the Air Education and Training Command. The Air Education and Training Instructor Badge is the Air Force equivalent to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Drill Sergeant Identification Badge.

The Air Education and Training Instructor Badge may be awarded as a temporary decoration to any Air Force service member who has completed a course of instruction as a Military Training Instructor or Academic Instructor. The badge is then presented upon the service member&#x27;s assignment to an Air Education and Training Command, such as basic training or Officer Training School. The badge is also occasionally granted to non-commissioned officers attached to Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps units who serve as Cadet Drill Instructors.

Instructors who have completed the requirements for their applicable master instructor program may be awarded the Air Education and Training Master Instructor Badge. Physically, the only difference between these two badges is the incorporation of the word &quot;MASTER&quot; arched in silver below the torch within the blue field of the badge&#x27;s shield.
In the early years of the Air Force, a different insignia was used by the Air Training Command known as the Air Force Training Instructor Badge. This badge was issued in two degrees Training Instructor and Master Training Instructor. The badge prominently featured a gold torch with red flames flanked by large outwardly stretched silver wings; below the wings is a scroll that incorporated the word &quot;INSTRUCTOR.&quot; For the Air Force Master Training Instructor Badge, a gold wreath that arched over the flame was added and incorporated a rocker with the word &quot;MASTER.&quot; These badges were worn on the cap or over the right breast pocket of Air Force uniforms. It was eventually replaced by the Air Education and Training Instructor Badge and Air Education and Training Master Instructor Badge.
The Air Force Professional Military Education (PME) Badge is worn by Air Force instructors that provide continuing professional military education that is focused on basic, primary, intermediate, and senior level education of Air Force Officers. These PME instructors should not be confused with instructors that wear the Air Education and Training Instructor Badges, who focus on the professional education of new recruits, non-commissioned officers, and officer cadets/candidates. PME instructors focus on furthering the education of company and field grade officers to help further their careers and develop highly educated Air Force professionals through specialized graduate level courses accredited by Air University.

The Air Force also has an Air Force Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (AFJROTC) Instructor Badge, which is similar in design to the Air Force Commander&#x27;s Insignia, that is worn by Air Force personnel assigned to AFJROTC units as instructors.

These badges served/serves as a duty identifier. Personnel who are no longer assigned to a wing or organization directly involved in training or education development may continue wearing these badges. However, duty badges of current assignments take precedence.

==Navy Recruit Division Commander Badges==

The United States Navy equivalent of the Army&#x27;s Drill Sergeant Identification Badge is the Recruit Division Commander Badge. As with Army Drill Sergeants, Division Commanders are responsible for basic military training of U.S. Navy recruits. For outstanding performance as a Division Commander, the Recruit Division Commander Badge can be upgraded with the Gold Wreath Award.

The Recruit Division Commander Badge is designed with a gold rope bordering the badge with a black band inside the gold rope which is embossed in gold lettering with the words &quot;Division Commander&quot;. The center contains an eagle design, similar to the Bureau of Naval Personnel Seal, on a white background encircled by gold link. The Gold Wreath Award version has a gold wreath that replaces the gold rope which has a white scroll at the top of the wreath with the word &quot;Excellence&quot; embossed in gold. Inside the gold wreath is the same Division Commander Badge described above.

The Division Commander badge is considered a temporary badge that must be surrendered upon completion of an instructor&#x27;s training assignment.

==Coast Guard Company Commander Insignia==

The United States Coast Guard equivalent of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Drill Sergeant Identification Badge is known as the Company Commander Insignia, which is a gold badge, similar to other Coast Guard qualification insignia, that&#x27;s awarded to qualified drill instructors as a permanent decoration/skill badge. As with Army Drill Sergeants, Coast Guard Company Commanders are responsible for basic military training of Coast Guard recruits. When Coast Guard Company Commanders are not assigned to instructor positions, they are relied on as experts in drill, ceremony, and physical fitness training.

The Company Commander Insignia is a permanent decoration and may be worn for the remainder of the Coast Guardsman&#x27;s military career.

<doc id="983126" wikidata="Q714749" url="?curid=983126" title="Battle of Ia Drang">
<text>The Battle of Ia Drang (, ; in English ) was the first major battle between the United States Army and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), as part of the Pleiku campaign conducted early in the Vietnam War, at the eastern foot of the Chu Pong Massif in the central highlands of Vietnam, in 1965. It is notable for being the first large scale helicopter air assault and also the first use of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers in a tactical support role. Ia Drang set the blueprint for the Vietnam War with the Americans relying on air mobility, artillery fire and close air support, while the PAVN neutralized that firepower by quickly engaging American forces at very close range.

Ia Drang comprised two main engagements, centered on two helicopter landing zones (LZs), the first known as LZ X-Ray, followed by LZ Albany, farther north in the Ia Drang Valley.

LZ X-Ray involved the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment and supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, and took place November 14–16, at LZ X-Ray. Surrounded and under heavy fire from a numerically superior force, the American forces were able to hold back the North Vietnamese forces over three days, largely through the support of air power and heavy artillery bombardment, which the North Vietnamese lacked. The Americans claimed LZ X-Ray as a tactical victory, citing a 10:1 kill ratio.

The second engagement involved the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment plus supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDade, and took place on November 17 at LZ Albany. When an American battalion was ambushed in close quarters, they were unable to use air and artillery support due to the close engagement of the North Vietnamese and the Americans suffered a casualty rate of over 50% before being extricated. Both sides claimed victory.

The battle at LZ X-Ray was documented in the CBS special report &quot;Battle of Ia Drang Valley&quot; by Morley Safer and the critically acclaimed book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once... And Young&quot; by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway. In 1994, Moore, Galloway and men who fought on both the American and North Vietnamese sides, traveled back to the remote jungle clearings where the battle took place. At the time the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with Vietnam. The risky trip which took a year to arrange was part of an award-winning ABC News documentary, &quot;They Were Young and Brave&quot; produced by Terence Wrong. Randall Wallace depicted the battle at LZ X-Ray in the 2002 movie &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; starring Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper as Moore and Galloway, respectively.

Galloway later described Ia Drang as &quot;the battle that convinced Ho Chi Minh he could win&quot;.

==Background==
By early 1965, the majority of rural South Vietnam was under limited Viet Cong (VC) control, increasingly supported by People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) regulars from North Vietnam. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) General William C. Westmoreland had secured the commitment of upward of 300,000 U.S. regulars from President Lyndon B. Johnson and a build-up of forces took place in the summer of 1965.

VC forces were in nominal control of most of the South Vietnamese countryside by 1965 and had established military infrastructure in the Central Highlands, to the northeast of the Saigon region. Vietnamese communist forces had operated in this area during the previous decade in the First Indochina War against the French, winning a notable victory at the Battle of Mang Yang Pass in 1954. There were few reliable roads into the area, making it an ideal place for the VC forces to form bases, relatively immune from attack by the generally road-bound Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces. During 1965, large groups of PAVN regulars moved into the area to conduct offensive operations. Attacks to the southwest from these bases threatened to cut South Vietnam in two.

By 1964 North Vietnam had established the B3 Front in the central highlands of South Vietnam. By early November 1965 three PAVN regiments – the 32nd, 33rd and 66th – and the H15 Local Force Battalion had been assembled in the area. The B3 Front commander, Maj. Gen. Chu Huy Mân, planned to target South Vietnamese positions in Kon Tum and Pleiku provinces. The city of Pleiku was the location of the South Vietnamese II Corps headquarters, commanded by General Vinh Loc, who had at his disposal nine South Vietnamese battalions: four Ranger, three Airborne and two Marine.

The U.S. command saw this as an ideal area to test new air mobility tactics. Air mobility called for battalion-sized forces to be delivered, supplied and extracted from an area of action using helicopters. Since the heavy weapons of a normal combined-arms force could not follow, the infantry would be supported by coordinated close air support, artillery and aerial rocket fire, arranged from a distance and directed by local observers. The new tactics had been developed in the U.S. by the 11th Air Assault Division (Test), which was renamed as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). The division&#x27;s troopers dubbed themselves the &quot;Air Cav&quot; (Air Cavalry) and in July 1965 began deploying to Camp Radcliff, An Khê, Vietnam. By November, most of the division&#x27;s three brigades were ready for operations.

The U.S. deployment caused the B3 Field Front Command to bring forward an attack on the U.S. Army Special Forces Plei Me camp, some 45 km southwest of Pleiku, which was originally planned for December. The assault was instead launched October 19 with only two Regiments, the 32nd and 33rd, instead of the planned three, before the Air Cavalry troops were combat ready. The plan was to attack the camp with the 33rd Regiment while the 32nd Regiment would lie in wait to ambush the ARVN relief force that would inevitably be sent from Pleiku. Once the relief force was destroyed, the two regiments were to join and take the camp. The initial attack was repulsed with the help of strong air support, and a small relief force reinforced the camp on the morning of the 22nd. The main relief force, advancing south from Pleiku on route 6C, was duly ambushed at 18:00 the next day. After a two-hour battle the ambushing forces were beaten off, but the ARVN, discouraged from moving any further, set up a defensive position, and did not reach the camp at Plei Me until dusk on the 25th. The PAVN forces withdrew west towards the Chu Pong Massif.

At the end of October, after the siege of Plei Me was lifted, General Westmoreland ordered General Harry Kinnard to take his division on to the offensive and seize the initiative in Pleiku province. Initial operations were conducted by 1st Brigade, and on November 1 they captured a PAVN aid station south west of Plei Me. Further engagements over the next few days revealed the arrival of the PAVN 66th Regiment. Having taken increasing casualties, 1st Brigade was relieved by 3rd Brigade, the handover being completed over the period November 7–12.

On November 11, intelligence source revealed the disposition of the three PAVN regiments: the 66th at vicinity YA9104, the 33rd at YA 940010 and the 32nd at YA 820070. On November 12, the 3rd Brigade was given orders by General Stanley R. Larsen, I Field Force, Vietnam Commander and General Richard T. Knowles, 1st Air Cavalry Division Forward Headquarters Commander to prepare for &quot;an air assault near the foot of the Chu Pongs&quot;, at , west of Plei Me.

On November 13, 3rd Brigade Commander Colonel Thomas W. Brown, acting following the order issued by Gen. Larsen and Gen. Knowles, met with Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore the commander of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and told him &quot;to conduct an airmobile assault the following morning&quot; and to conduct search and destroy operations through 15 November. Meanwhile, an ARVN intelligence source by intercept of radio communication indicated that some PAVN B3 Field Front recon elements and transportation units had already moved out of their assembly areas to attack the Plei Me camp.
;Landing zones

Col. Brown selected Lt. Col. Moore and his men for the mission, with the explicit orders not to attempt to scale the mountain. There were several clearings in the area that had been designated as possible helicopter landing zones, typically named for a letter of the NATO phonetic alphabet. Moore selected:
* LZ X-Ray: at as his landing zone, a flat clearing surrounded by low trees at the eastern base of the Chu Pong Massif and bordered by a dry creek bed on the west. The Ia Drang River was about to the northwest.
* LZ Albany: about to the northeast of X-Ray at 
* LZ Columbus: about east of Albany at 
* LZ Tango: about to the north of X-Ray at 
* LZ Yankee: a similar distance south of X-Ray at . LZ Yankee was on sloping ground and could only fit about 6–8 helicopters at one time.
* LZ Whiskey: south-east at 
* LZ Victor: at about to the south-southeast.

Artillery support would be provided from fire support base &quot;FSB Falcon&quot;, about to the northeast of X-Ray at .

General Knowles stated that he had selected the initial landing zone used by Hal Moore and his troops, knowing quite well that the PAVN lacked anti-aircraft guns and heavy mortars that had been destroyed during the attack on the Plei Me camp and that the PAVN could have positioned on the hillsides overlooking the landing zone to gun down the helicopters and to decimate the cavalry troops landing on the ground.

LZ X-Ray was approximately the size of a misshapen football field, some 100 meters in length (east to west). It was estimated that only eight UH-1 Hueys could fit in the clearing at a given time. The 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (1/7) was typical for U.S. Army units of the time, consisting of three rifle companies and a heavy weapons company: A-Alpha Company, B-Bravo Company, C-Charlie Company and D-Delta Company... about 450 men in total of the 765 of the battalion&#x27;s authorized strength. They were to be shuttled by 16 Huey transport helicopters, which could generally carry 10 to 12 equipped troopers, so the battalion would have to be delivered in several &quot;lifts&quot; carrying just less than one complete company each time. Each lift would take about 30 minutes. Moore arranged the lifts to deliver Bravo Company first, along with his command team, followed by Alpha and Charlie Companies, and finally Delta Company. Moore&#x27;s plan was to move Bravo and Alpha Companies northwest past the creek bed, and Charlie Company south toward the mountain. Delta Company, which comprised special weapons forces including mortar, recon, and machine gun units, was to be used as the battlefield reserve. In the center of the LZ was a large termite hill that was to become Moore&#x27;s command post. Furthermore, the Bravo Company of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry closed in at 18:00.

==LZ X-Ray==
===Day 1: November 14, 1965===
====Landings====
On November 14, an ARVN intelligence source by intercept of radio communication indicated that before dawn, some assault elements of the PAVN B3 Field Front started moving out of their assembly areas to attack the Plei Me camp.

At 10:48, the first troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (1/7) arrived at LZ X-Ray with members of B Company touching down after about 30 minutes of bombardment via artillery, aerial rockets and air strikes. The troops were inserted about 200 meters from the position of the PAVN 9th Battalion, 66th Regiment.

The air assault insertion had the effect of causing the B3 Field Front to postpone the attack on the Plei Me camp. B3 Field Front Command fell for the subterfuge, decided to postpone the attack on Plei Me camp, and met the new threat with its 7th and 9th Battalions, while the remaining units of its force were put on hold at their staging positions.

Accompanying Captain John Herren&#x27;s B Company were Moore and his 1st Battalion command group. Instead of attempting to secure the entire landing zone with such a limited force, most of B Company was kept near the center of the LZ as a strike force, while smaller units were sent out to reconnoiter the surrounding area. Following their arrival, Herren ordered B Company to move west past the creek bed. Within approximately 30 minutes, one of his squads under Sgt. John Mingo surprised and captured an unarmed deserter from the PAVN 33rd Regiment. The prisoner revealed that there were three PAVN battalions on the Chu Pong Mountain – an estimated 1,600 troops compared to fewer than 200 American soldiers on the ground at that point. At 11:20, the second lift from the 1st battalion arrived, with the rest of B Company and one platoon of Capt. Tony Nadal&#x27;s A Company. Fifty minutes later, the third lift arrived, consisting of the other two platoons of A Company. A Company took up positions to the rear and left flank of B Company along the dry creek bed, and to the west and to the south facing perpendicular down the creek bed.

At 12:15, the first shots were fired on the three platoons of B Company that were patrolling the jungle northwest of the dry creek bed. Five minutes later, Herren ordered his 1st Platoon under Lt. Al Devney and 2nd Platoon under Lt. Henry Herrick to advance abreast of each other and the 3rd Platoon (under Lt. Dennis Deal) to follow as a reserve unit. Lt. Devney&#x27;s 1st Platoon led approximately west of the creek bed, with Herrick&#x27;s 2nd Platoon to his rear and right flank. Just before 13:00, Devney&#x27;s 1st platoon was heavily assaulted on both flanks by the PAVN, taking casualties and becoming pinned down in the process. It was around this point that Herrick radioed in that his 2nd Platoon were taking fire from their right flank, and that he was pursuing a squad of PAVN in that direction.

Knowles called Kinnard to report that the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry had engaged the enemy and requested an additional battalion – the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry – to counter the PAVN 7th and 9th Battalions.

====Herrick&#x27;s platoon is cut off====
In pursuit of the PAVN on his right flank, Herrick&#x27;s 2nd Platoon, B Company, was quickly spread out over a space of around 50 meters, and became separated from the rest of 1/7 by approximately 100 meters. Soon, Herrick radioed in to ask whether he should enter or circumvent a clearing that his platoon had come across in the bush. Herrick expressed concerns that he might become cut off from the battalion if he tried to skirt the clearing and therefore would be leading his men through it in pursuit of the enemy. An intense firefight quickly erupted in the clearing; during the first three or four minutes his platoon inflicted heavy losses on the PAVN who streamed out of the trees, while his men did not take any casualties. Herrick soon radioed in that the enemy were closing in around his left and right flanks. Capt. Herren responded by ordering Herrick to attempt to link back with Devney&#x27;s 1st Platoon. Herrick replied that there was a large enemy force between his men and 1st Platoon. The situation quickly disintegrated for Herrick&#x27;s 2nd Platoon, which began taking casualties as the PAVN attack persisted. Herrick ordered his men to form a defensive perimeter on a small knoll in the clearing. Within approximately 25 minutes, five men of 2nd Platoon were killed, including Herrick who, before dying, radioed Herren to report that he was hit and was passing command over to Sgt. Carl Palmer, ordered the signals codes to be destroyed and artillery support to be called in. 2nd Platoon was technically under the command of SFC Mac McHenry, but he was positioned elsewhere on the perimeter. Sgts. Palmer and Robert Stokes were also dead, leaving Sgt. Ernie Savage, 3rd Squad Leader, to assume command by virtue of being close to the radio, and proceeded to call in repeated artillery support around the 2nd Platoon&#x27;s position. By this point, eight men of the platoon had been killed and 13 wounded.

Under Savage&#x27;s leadership, and with the extraordinary care of the 2nd Platoon&#x27;s medic Charlie Lose, the platoon held the knoll for the duration of the battle at X-Ray. Spec. Galen Bungum, 2nd Platoon, B Company, later said of the stand at the knoll: &quot;We gathered up all the full magazines we could find and stacked them up in front of us. There was no way we could dig a foxhole. The handle was blown off my entrenching tool and one of my canteens had a hole blown through it. The fire was so heavy that if you tried to raise up to dig you were dead. There was death and destruction all around.&quot; Savage later recalled of the repeated PAVN assaults: &quot;It seemed like they didn&#x27;t care how many of them were killed. Some of them were stumbling, walking right into us. Some had their guns slung and were charging bare-handed. I didn&#x27;t run out of ammo – had about thirty magazines in my pack. And no problems with the M16. An hour before dark three men walked up on the perimeter. I killed all three of them 15 feet away.&quot;

====Fight for the creek bed====

With 2nd Platoon, B Company cut off and surrounded, the rest of 1/7 fought to maintain a perimeter. At 13:32, C Company under Capt. Bob Edwards arrived, taking up positions along the south and southwest facing the mountain. At around 13:45, through his Operations Officer flying above the battlefield (Capt. Matt Dillon), Moore called in air strikes, artillery and aerial rocket artillery on the mountain to prevent the North Vietnamese from advancing on the battalion&#x27;s position.

Lt. Bob Taft&#x27;s 3rd Platoon, A Company, confronted approximately 150 PAVN soldiers advancing down the length and sides of the creek bed (from the south) toward the battalion. The platoon&#x27;s troopers were told to drop their packs and move forward for the assault. The resulting exchange was particularly costly for the platoon — its lead forces were quickly cut down. 3rd Platoon was forced to pull back, and its leader Lt. Taft was killed. Sgt. Lorenzo Nathan, a Korean War veteran, took command of 3rd Platoon which was able to halt the PAVN advance down the creek bed. The PAVN forces shifted their attack to 3rd Platoon&#x27;s right flank in an attempt to flank B Company. Their advance was quickly stopped by Lt. Walter &quot;Joe&quot; Marm&#x27;s 2nd Platoon, A Company, situated on B Company&#x27;s left flank. Moore had ordered Captain Nadal (A Company) to lend B Company one of his platoons, in an effort to allow Herren (B Company) to attempt to fight through to Herrick&#x27;s (2nd Platoon, B Company) position. From Lt. Marm&#x27;s (2nd Platoon, A Company) new position, his men killed some 80 PAVN troops with close range machine gun, rifle, and grenade assault. The surviving PAVN made their way back to the creek bed, where they were cut down by fire from the rest of A Company. Taft&#x27;s (3rd Platoon, A Company) dog tags were discovered on the body of a PAVN soldier who had been killed by Taft&#x27;s platoon. Upset that Taft&#x27;s body had been left on the battlefield, Nadal (A Company commander) and his radio operator, Sgt. Jack Gell, brought his and the bodies of other Americans back to the creek bed under heavy fire.

====Attack from the south====
At 14:30, the last troops of C Company (1/7) arrived, along with the lead elements of D Company (1/7) under Capt. Ray Lefebvre. The insertion took place with intense PAVN fire pouring into the landing zone, and the Huey crews and newly arrived 1/7 troopers suffered many casualties. The small contingent of D Company took up position on A Company&#x27;s left flank. C Company, assembled along the south and southwest in full strength, was met within minutes by a head-on assault. C Company&#x27;s commander, Capt. Edwards, radioed in that an estimated 175 to 200 PAVN troops were charging his company&#x27;s lines. With a clear line of sight over their sector of the battlefield, C Company was able to call in and adjust heavy ordnance support with precision, inflicting devastating losses on the PAVN forces. Many PAVN soldiers were burned to death as they scrambled from their bunkers in a hasty retreat, while others were caught in a second barrage of artillery shells. By 15:00 the attack had been stopped, and one hour after launching the assault the PAVN forces withdrew.

====Attack on Alpha and Delta Companies====
At approximately the same time, A Company and the lead elements of D Company (which had accompanied Alpha Company at the perimeter in the vicinity of the creek bed) were subjected to a fierce PAVN attack. Covering the critical left flank were two of A Company&#x27;s machine gun crews positioned southwest of the company&#x27;s main position. Spec. Theron Ladner (with his assistant gunner PFC Rodriguez Rivera) and Spec. 4 Russell Adams (with his assistant gunner Spec. 4 Bill Beck) had positioned their guns apart, and proceeded to pour heavy fire into the PAVN forces attempting to cut into the perimeter between C and A Companies. Moore later credited the two gun teams with preventing the PAVN from rolling up Alpha Company and driving a wedge into the battalion between Alpha and Charlie Companies. Spec. 4 Adams and Pfc. Rivera were severely wounded in the attack. After the two were carried to the battalion&#x27;s collection point at Moore&#x27;s command post to await evacuation by air, Spec. 4 Beck, Spec. Ladner and Pfc. Edward Dougherty (an ammo bearer) continued their close range suppression of the PAVN advance. Spec. 4 Beck later said of the battle: &quot;When Doc Nall was there with me, working on Russell, fear, real fear, hit me. Fear like I had never known before. Fear comes, and once you recognize it and accept it, it passes just as fast as it comes, and you don&#x27;t really think about it anymore. You just do what you have to do, but you learn the real meaning of fear and life and death. For the next two hours I was alone on that gun, shooting at the enemy.&quot;

Delta Company&#x27;s troopers also experienced heavy losses in repelling the PAVN assault and Captain Lefebvre was wounded soon after arriving at LZ X-Ray. One of his platoon leaders, Lt. Raul Taboada, was also severely wounded, and Lefebvre passed command of D Company to SSgt. George Gonzales (who, unknown to Lefebvre, had also been wounded). While medical evacuation helicopters (medevacs) were supposed to transport the battalion&#x27;s increasing numbers of casualties, they evacuated only two before the pilots called off their mission under intense PAVN fire. Casualties were loaded onto the assault Hueys (lifting the battalion&#x27;s forces to X-Ray), whose pilots carried load after load of wounded from the battlefield. 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry&#x27;s intelligence officer Capt. Tom Metsker (who had been wounded) was fatally hit when helping Lefebvre aboard a Huey.

====360-degree perimeter====
Capt. Edwards (C Company) ordered SSgt. Gonzales who had been given command of D Company by its commander, to position D Company on C Company&#x27;s left flank, extending the perimeter to cover the southeast side of X-Ray. At 15:20, the last of the 1st battalion arrived and Lt. Larry Litton assumed command of D Company. It was during this lift that one Huey, having approached the landing zone too high, crash-landed on the outskirts of the perimeter near the command post (those on board were quickly rescued by the battalion). With Delta Company&#x27;s weapons teams on the ground, its mortar units were concentrated with the rest of the battalion&#x27;s in a single station to support Alpha and Bravo Companies. D Company&#x27;s reconnaissance platoon (commanded by Lieutenant James Rackstraw) was positioned along the north and east of the landing zone, establishing a 360-degree perimeter over X-Ray. Had the PAVN forces circled around to the north of the U.S. positions prior to this point, they would have found their approach unhindered.

====Second push to the lost platoon====
As the PAVN attack on Alpha Company diminished, Moore organized another effort to rescue 2nd Platoon, B Company. At 15:45, Moore ordered Alpha Company and Bravo Company to evacuate their casualties and pull back from engagement with the PAVN. Shortly after, Alpha and Bravo Companies began their advance from the creek bed toward 2nd Platoon, B Company and soon suffered casualties. At one point, B Company&#x27;s advance was halted by a firmly entrenched PAVN machine-gun position at a large termite hill. Lt. Marm, 2nd Platoon, A Company, fired a light anti-tank weapon (LAW) at the machine-gun position, charged the position with grenades while under fire, and killed the remaining PAVN at the machine-gun position with rifle fire. The following day, a dozen dead PAVN troops (including one officer) were found in the position. Marm was wounded in the neck and jaw in the assault and was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his lone assault. The second push had advanced just over toward the lost platoon&#x27;s position before being stopped by the PAVN. Alpha Company&#x27;s 1st Platoon, leading the advance, was at risk of becoming separated from the battalion, and at one point it was being engaged by an American M60 machine gun that had been taken by the PAVN from a dead 2nd Platoon gunner. The impasse lasted between 20 and 30 minutes before Nadal (A Company) and Herren (B Company) requested permission to withdraw back to X-Ray (to which Moore agreed).

====Americans dig in for the night====
Near 17:00, the lead elements of Bravo Company of 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry (2/7) arrived at LZ X-Ray to reinforce the embattled 1st Battalion; the company closed in at 18:00 hours. In preparation for a defensive position to last the night, Moore ordered Bravo Company&#x27;s commander Capt. Myron Diduryk to place two of his platoons between B/1/7 and D/1/7 on the northeast side of the perimeter. Diduryk&#x27;s 2nd Platoon, B Company (under Lt. James Lane), was used to reinforce C/1/7&#x27;s position (which was stretched over a disproportionately long line). By nightfall, the battle had taken a heavy toll on Moore&#x27;s battalion (1/7): B company had taken 47 casualties (including one officer) and A Company had taken 34 casualties (including three officers); C company had taken four casualties.

Around this time, Colonel Brown ordered the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry to be heli-lifted to LZ Victor, at 5 kilometers from LZ X-Ray to be ready to reinforce the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry the next morning.
The American forces were placed on full alert throughout the night. Under the light of a bright moon, the PAVN probed every company on the perimeter (with the exception of D/1/7) in small squad-sized units. The Americans exercised some level of restraint in their response. The M60 gun crews, tactically positioned around the perimeter to provide for multiple fields of fire, were told to hold their fire until otherwise ordered (so as to conceal their true location from the PAVN). Second Platoon of B Company (1/7) under the leadership of Sgt. Savage, suffered three sizable assaults of the night (one just before midnight, one at 03:15, and one at 04:30). The PAVN, using bugles to signal their forces, were repelled from the knoll with artillery, grenade and rifle fire. Savage&#x27;s &quot;lost platoon&quot; survived the night without taking additional casualties.

At 18:50, Gen. Kinnard discussed with Gen. Larsen the possibility of having a B-52 strike at the area of LZ X-Ray. At 21:00 the 1st Air Cavalry selected coordinates for B-52 strike in Code – YA 870000, YA 830000, YA 830070, YA 870070 with alternative targets (in Code) YA 8607, YA 9007, YA 9000, YA 8600.

===Day 2: November 15===

====Attack at dawn====
At 06:00 J3/MACV notified 1st Air Cavalry that the time over target of the B-52 strike was set for 16:00.

Just before dawn at 06:20, Moore ordered his battalion&#x27;s companies to put out reconnaissance patrols to probe for PAVN forces. At 06:50, patrols from Charlie Company&#x27;s 1st Platoon (under Lt. Neil Kroger) and 2nd Platoon (under Lt. John Geoghegan) had advanced from the perimeter before coming into contact with PAVN troops. A firefight broke out, and the patrols quickly withdrew to the perimeter. Shortly after, an estimated 200-plus PAVN troops charged 1st and 2nd Platoons of C Company on the south side of the perimeter. Heavy ordnance support was called in, but the PAVN were soon within of the 1st Battalion&#x27;s lines. Their fire began to cut through Charlie Company&#x27;s positions and into the command post and the American lines across the LZ. 1st and 2nd platoons suffered significant casualties in this assault, including Lts. Kroger and Geoghegan. Geoghegan was killed while attempting to rescue one of his wounded men, Pfc. Willie Godboldt (who died of his wounds shortly thereafter). Two M60 crews (under Spec. James Comer and Spec. 4s Clinton Poley, Nathaniel Byrd and George Foxe) were instrumental in preventing the PAVN advance from completely overrunning Geoghegan&#x27;s lines. Following this attack, Charlie Company&#x27;s 3rd Platoon under Lt. William Franklin came under assault. C Company&#x27;s commander, Capt. Edwards was seriously wounded and Lt. John Arrington assumed command of the company and was himself wounded while receiving instructions from Edwards. C Company&#x27;s command then passed to Platoon Sgt. Glenn A. Kennedy. Lt. Franklin was also seriously wounded. The battalion was being attacked in two directions.

====Three-pronged attack====
At 07:45, the PAVN launched an assault on Crack Rock, near its connection with the beleaguered C/1/7. Enemy fire started to hit the 1st Battalion command post, which suffered one medic killed and several other troops wounded (including one of Moore&#x27;s own radio operators, Spec. 4 Robert Ouellette). Under heavy attack on three sides, the battalion fought off repeated waves of PAVN infantry. It was during this battle that Spec. Willard Parish of Charlie Company, situated on Delta Company&#x27;s lines, earned a Silver Star for suppressing an intense PAVN assault in his sector. After expending his M60 ammunition, Parish resorted to his .45 sidearm to repel PAVN forces that advanced within of his foxhole. After the battle, more than 100 dead PAVN troops were discovered around his position.

As the battle along the southern line intensified, Lt. Charlie W. Hastings (U.S. Air Force liaison forward air controller) was instructed by Moore (based on criteria established by the Air Force) to transmit the code phrase &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, which relayed that an American combat unit was in danger of being overrun. In so doing, Hastings was calling on all available support aircraft in South Vietnam to come to the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry&#x27;s defense, drawing on a significant arsenal of heavy ordnance support. On Charlie Company&#x27;s broken lines, PAVN troops walked the lines for several minutes, killing wounded Americans and stripping their bodies of weapons and other items. It was around this time, at 07:55, that Moore ordered his men to throw colored smoke grenades to mark the battalion perimeter. Aerial fire support was then called in on the PAVN at close range – including those along Charlie Company&#x27;s lines. Shortly afterwards, Moore&#x27;s command post was subjected to a friendly fire incident by two F-100 Super Sabre dropping napalm. Seeing the approaching F-100&#x27;s about to drop their bombs dangerously close to the American positions, Hastings frantically radioed them to abort the attack and change course. The pilot of the second F-100, Lt.Col. Harold Comstock, complied and disengaged, but the ordnance from the first F-100 had already been dropped. Despite Hastings&#x27; best efforts, several American soldiers were wounded or killed by this air strike. News reporter Joe Galloway, who helped carry one of the badly wounded men (who died two days later) to an aid station, tried to attach a name to the death occurring around him, discovering that this particular soldier&#x27;s name was Pfc. Jimmy Nakayama of Rigby, Idaho who had been a 2nd Lt. in the National Guard. Galloway later shared how that same week Nakayama became a father. Galloway also noted &quot;[a]t LZ XRay 80 men died and 124 were wounded, many of them terribly&quot;, and that the death toll for the entire battle was 234 Americans killed and perhaps as many as 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers.

At 08:00, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry set out on foot from LZ-Victor to reinforce LZ X-Ray.

At 09:10, the first elements of Alpha Company (2/7), under Capt. Joel Sugdinis, arrived at X-Ray. Capt. Sugdinis&#x27;s forces reinforced the survivors of Charlie Company (1/7). By 10:00, the PAVN had begun to withdraw from the battle, although sporadic fire still continued to harass the Americans. Charlie Company, having inflicted scores of losses on the PAVN, had suffered 42 killed in action (KIA) and 20 wounded in action (WIA) over the course of the -hour assault. Lt. Rick Rescorla, a platoon leader of Capt. Diduryk&#x27;s Bravo Company (2/7) after having policed up the battlefield in Charlie Company&#x27;s sector following the assaults, later remarked: &quot;There were American and NVA bodies everywhere. My area was where Lt. Geoghegan&#x27;s platoon (2nd Platoon, C Company) had been. There were several dead NVA around his platoon command post. One dead trooper was locked in contact with a dead NVA, hands around the enemy&#x27;s throat. There were two troopers – one black, one Hispanic – linked tight together. It looked like they had died trying to help each other.&quot;

At 09:30, Col. Brown, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), landed at LZ X-Ray to make preparation to withdraw the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, deeming its job done. He intended to establish a 3rd Air Cavalry Brigade forward command post in order to take over the command of the battlefield with the presence of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry and the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry on the ground at LZ X-Ray. When Moore refused to relinquish the command of his battalion, Brown contented to notify him before leaving that the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry was withdrawn the next day.

====Reinforcements====

Given the tempo of combat at LZ X-Ray and the losses being suffered, other units of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) planned to land nearby and then move overland to X-Ray. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry (2/5), was to be flown into LZ Victor, about 3.5 kilometers east-southeast of LZ X-Ray. 2/5 flew in at 08:00 and quickly organized to move out, the trip taking about 4 hours. Most of this was uneventful until they were approaching X-Ray. At about 10:00, some to the east of the LZ, Alpha Company (2/7) received some light fire and had to set up a combat front. At 12:05, Lt. Col Tully&#x27;s 2/5 troopers had arrived at the LZ.

Because the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry stealthily closed in the battlefield by foot instead of by heli-lift, B3 Field Front was unaware that the opponent troop ratio had switched from 2:2 to 3:2.

At 10:30 General DePuy, J3/MACV called Colonel Barrow to make sure that the B-52 had been cleared with General Vĩnh Lộc, Commander General II Corps and if the elements of 1st Cavalry had received the time on target 16:00 hours restriction and would comply.

====Third push to the lost platoon====
Using a plan devised by Moore, Tully (2/5) commanded B/1/7, A/2/5, and C/2/5 in a third major effort to relieve the lost B Company platoon of 1/7 under Sgt. Ernie Savage. Making use of fire support, the relief force slowly made its way to the knoll without encountering PAVN. 2nd Platoon, B Company had survived but at great cost; out of the 29 men, 9 were KIA and 13 WIA. At around 15:30, the relief force started to encounter sniper fire and began carrying the wounded and dead of the lost platoon back to X-Ray. The expanded force at X-Ray, consisting of Moore&#x27;s weakened 1/7, two companies of the 2/7, and Tully&#x27;s 2/5, consolidated at X-Ray for the night. At the LZ, the wounded and dead were evacuated, and the remaining American forces dug in and fortified their lines.
At precisely 16:00, the first wave of B-52 carpet bombings fell at YA 8702 (about 7 kilometers west of LZ X-Ray), aiming mainly to strike the units of the 32nd Regiment that were located about 5 kilometers further west and would carry on for 5 consecutive days. Lt. Col. Nguyễn Hữu An was on his way from his forward command post to the LZ X-Ray to meet with Lã Ngọc Châu, 7th Battalion interim Commander, when he first saw the waves of B-52 carpet bombings raining down. Air Cavalry units at the scene reported seeing three .50 caliber machine gun positions firing at the aircraft that were directly in path of strike. General DePuy, J3/MACV, who executed this B-52 airstrike stated that &quot;this is the fastest a strike of this nature had ever been laid-on.&quot;

At 16:30, Brigadier General Knowles, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) Forward CP Commander, landed at the LZ X-Ray to announce the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry set for the next day.

At 20:40, 1st Air Cavalry requested for second B-52 strike with primary targets set for YA 830050, YA 850050, YA 843000 and alternative set for YV 890980, YV 910980, YV 890950, YV 910950.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3 Journal/IFFV, November 15 entry&quot;&gt;G3 Journal/IFFV, November 15 entry&lt;/ref&gt;

Around midnight, Moore received from Lt. Colonel Edward C. (Shy) Meyer, 3rd Brigade executive officer, a message saying that Westmoreland&#x27;s headquarters wanted him to &quot;leave X-Ray early the next morning for Saigon to brief him and his staff on the battle.&quot; He vehemently objected to the order and was allowed to remain with his battalion until its withdrawal planned for the next morning.

===Day 3: November 16===
The American lines at X-Ray were harassed during the night of 15 November by PAVN probes. Shortly before 04:00 of the third day grenade booby traps and trip flares set by Diduryk&#x27;s Bravo Company (2/7) began to erupt. At 04:22 the PAVN launched a fierce assault against Diduryk&#x27;s men. Bravo fought off this attack by an estimated 300 PAVN in minutes. A decisive factor in this stand, in addition to rifle and machine gun fire from B Company&#x27;s lines, was the skilled placement of artillery strikes by Diduryk&#x27;s forward observer, Lt. Bill Lund. Making use of four artillery batteries, Lund organized fire into separate concentrations along the battlefield with devastating consequences for the waves of advancing PAVN.

The PAVN repeated their assault on Diduryk&#x27;s lines 20 minutes after the first attack as flares dropped from American C-123 Provider aircraft illuminated the battlefield to B Company&#x27;s advantage. For around 30 minutes B Company fought off the PAVN advance with a combination of small arms and Lund&#x27;s skilled organization of artillery strikes. Shortly after 05:00 a third attack was launched against B Company, which was repelled by Lt. James Lane&#x27;s platoon within 30 minutes. At almost 06:30 the PAVN launched a fourth attack on Diduryk&#x27;s men – this time in the vicinity of B Company&#x27;s command post. Again, Lund&#x27;s precision in ordering artillery strikes cut down scores of PAVN soldiers, while Diduryk&#x27;s men repelled those who survived using rifle and machine gun fire. At the end of these attacks, with daybreak approaching, Diduryk&#x27;s Company had only six lightly wounded men among its ranks – with none killed.

====LZ X-Ray secured====
At 08:30, Gen. DePuy asked Gen. Knowles if he had plans for exploitation of yesterday&#x27;s strike, and if he had a plan to commit another battalion for a total of 5 – besides the 1/7, 2/7, 2/5 and 1/9 Air Cav Battalions in the area. At 09:15, Knowles wanted the cavalry units on the ground to organize an exploitation of B-52 strike target operation. Moore responded that he had plans to send in 1st Cav, although at the present time all units were engaged.

Around 10:30 a.m., 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry received orders to withdraw from the battle zone while 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry and 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry took up defensive positions for the night. According to the assessment of ARVN Gen. Nguyen Vinh Loc, at the LZ X-Ray battle, the PAVN did not have anti-aircraft weapons and heavy mortars and had to resort to &quot;human wave&quot; tactics: &quot;The enemy has lost nearly all their heavy crew-served weapons during the first phase ... Their tactics relied mostly on the &#x27;human waves.&#x27;&quot;

The battle was ostensibly over. The PAVN forces had suffered hundreds of casualties and were no longer capable of fighting. U.S. forces had suffered 79 killed and 121 wounded and had been reinforced to levels that would guarantee their safety. Given the situation, there was no reason for U.S. forces to stay in the field, their mission was complete and a success. Moreover, Colonel Brown (3rd Brigade commander), in overall command, was worried about reports that additional PAVN units were moving into the area over the border. He wanted to withdraw the units but Westmoreland demanded that the 2/7 and 2/5 stay at X-Ray to avoid the appearance of a retreat.

The U.S. reported the bodies of 634 PAVN soldiers were found in the vicinity and estimated that 1,215 PAVN were killed a distance away by artillery and airstrikes. Six PAVN were captured. Six PAVN crew-served weapons and 135 individual weapons were captured, and an estimated 75–100 weapons were destroyed. The normal ratio of enemy soldiers killed to weapons captured as later established by the Department of Defense was 3 or 4 to one.

At 12:53, Gen. Westmoreland enquired if the Cavalry had sufficient air support and if the troops were fine. At 16:25, 1st Air Cavalry TOC made an Arc Light request for YV 932985, YV 936996, YA 898005, YA 898019 at 13:00, not later than 17:00. At 18:50, II Corps Commanding General concurred with the Arc Light request. Around 20:25, DePuy finalized the plan to have B-52 bombers strike the LZ X-Ray the next day by noon. He received Brown&#x27;s assurance that the friendly troops had enough lead time and would meet the 3 km safety limits by then.

==LZ Albany==

===Day 4: November 17===
At 09:00, 1st Air Cavalry TOC submitted an Arc Light request to J3/MACV for 13:00 on 18 November.

Meanwhile, the two remaining battalions abandoned LZ X-Ray and began a tactical march to new landing zones. Lt. Col. Bob Tully, commanding the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, went to LZ Columbus about to the northeast, and Lt. Col. Robert McDade, commanding the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, went to LZ Albany about to the north-northeast, close to the Ia Drang. Tully&#x27;s men moved out at 09:00; McDade&#x27;s followed 10 minutes later. B-52s were on their way from Guam, and their target for the third day of bombing was the slopes of the Chu Pong massif and LZ X-Ray itself. The U.S. ground forces had to move outside a safety zone by midmorning to be clear of the bombardment. With the two remaining battalions quietly abandoning the landing zone by land instead of by helicopters to make way for the B-52 strike any PAVN troops of the 7th and 9th Battalions at the vacated X-Ray area were caught by surprise.

====Events leading to an ambush====
The first indication of PAVN presence was observed by the reconnaissance platoon&#x27;s point squad, leading the American column. SSgt. Donald J. Slovak, the squad leader, saw &quot;Ho Chi Minh sandal foot markings, bamboo arrows on the ground pointing north, matted grass and grains of rice.&quot; After marching about 2,000 meters, Alpha Company (2/7) leading 2/7, headed northwest, while 2/5 continued on to LZ Columbus. Alpha Company came upon some grass huts, which they were directed to burn. At 11:38, Tully&#x27;s men of 2/5, were logged into its objective, LZ Columbus. PAVN troops in the area consisted of elements the 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion, 33rd Regiment. The 33rd Regiment&#x27;s battalions were under strength from casualties incurred during the battle at the Plei Me camp, the 8th Battalion was Gen. Mân&#x27;s reserve battalion, fresh and rested.

The elements of the two PAVN battalions that were involved in the clash with the Air Cavalry troops were: 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment, 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment, 6th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, 7th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment and 8th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment. While the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry was moving up northwest toward the position of 1st Battalion CP, 33rd Regiment nested at the east side of Ia Drang river, the 8th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment marched down southeast along the Ia Drang river, and the 6th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment and 7th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment marched down on a collision path toward the Air Cavalry unit. The 8th Battalion was led by Lê Xuân Phối.

Alpha Company noticed the sudden absence of air cover and their commander, Capt. Joel Sugdinis, wondered where the aerial rocket artillery choppers were. He soon heard the sound of distant explosions to his rear; the B-52s were making their bombing runs on the Chu Pong massif. Lt. D. P. (Pat) Payne, the recon platoon leader, was walking around some termite hills when he suddenly came upon a PAVN soldier resting on the ground. Payne jumped on the soldier and took him prisoner. Simultaneously, about 10 yards away, his platoon sergeant captured a second PAVN soldier. Other members of the PAVN recon team may have escaped and reported to the headquarters of the 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment. The PAVN then began to organize an assault on the American column. As word of the capture reached him, McDade ordered a halt as he went forward from the rear of the column to interrogate the prisoners personally. The two captured PAVN soldiers were policed up about 100 yards from the southwestern edge of the Albany clearing, the report of which reached division forward at Pleiku at 11:57.

McDade then called his company commanders of 2/7 forward for a conference; most of whom were accompanied by their radio operators. Alpha Company moved forward to LZ Albany; McDade and his command group were with them. Following orders, the other company commanders were moving forward to join McDade. Delta Company, which was next in the column following Alpha Company, was holding in place; so was Charlie Company, which was next in line. Second Battalion Headquarters Company followed and Alpha Company, 1/5, brought up the rear of the column. The American column was halted in unprepared, open terrain and strung out in line of march. Most of the units had flank security posted, but the men were worn out from almost 60 hours without sleep and four hours of marching. The elephant grass was chest-high so visibility was limited. The radios for air or artillery support were with the company commanders.

An hour and 10 minutes after the PAVN recon soldiers were captured, Alpha Company and McDade&#x27;s command group had reached the Albany clearing. McDade and his group walked across the clearing and into a clump of trees. Beyond that clump of trees was another clearing. The remainder of the battalion was in a dispersed column to the east of the LZ. Battalion SgtMaj. James Scott and Sgt. Charles Bass then attempted to question the prisoners again. While they were doing this, Bass heard Vietnamese voices and the interpreter confirmed that these were PAVN talking. Alpha Company had been in the LZ about five minutes and about then, small arms fire began.

====2nd Battalion ambushed====
Lt. Pat Payne&#x27;s reconnaissance platoon had walked to within of the headquarters of the PAVN 3rd Battalion, 33rd Regiment; the 550 men of the 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment had been bivouacked to the northeast of the American column. As the Americans rested in the tall grass, PAVN soldiers were coming toward them by the hundreds. It was 13:15. The close quarters battle lasted for 16 hours. PAVN forces first struck at the head of 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry&#x27;s column and rapidly spread down the right or east side of the column in an L-shaped ambush. PAVN troops ran down the length of the column, with units peeling off to attack the outnumbered American soldiers, engaging in hand-to-hand combat.

The 6th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment made contact head on with 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, the 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment and 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment maneuvered eastward and attacked the lower and upper flanks respectively and the 8th Company, 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment switched its direction north-westward and attacked the column from behind. McDade&#x27;s command group made it into the clump of trees between the two clearings of LZ Albany. They took cover from rifle and mortar fire within the trees and termite hills. The reconnaissance platoon and 1st Platoon, Alpha Company, provided initial defense at the position. By 13:26, they had been cut off from the rest of the column; the area whence they had come was full of PAVN soldiers. While they waited for air support, the Americans holding LZ Albany drove off any PAVN assaults on them and sniped at the exposed enemy wandering around the perimeter. It was later discovered that the PAVN were mopping up, looking for wounded American soldiers in the tall grass and killing them.

All the while the noise of battle could be heard in the woods as the other companies fought. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry had been reduced to a small perimeter at Albany composed of survivors of Alpha Company, the recon platoon, survivors from the destroyed Charlie and Delta Companies and the command group. There was also a smaller perimeter at the rear of the column about 500–700 yards due south: Capt. George Forrest&#x27;s Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry. Forrest had run a gauntlet all the way from the conference called by McDade back to his company when the PAVN mortar rounds started coming in. Charlie and Alpha companies lost 70 men in the first few minutes. Charlie Company suffered 45 dead and more than 50 wounded, the heaviest casualties of any unit that fought on Albany. USAF A-1E Skyraiders soon provided support by dropping napalm bombs, but because of the fog of war and the inter-mixing of American and PAVN troops, it is likely that air and artillery strikes killed NVA and American soldiers indiscriminately. During the battle, Lê Xuân Phôi, the PAVN field commander of 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, was mortally wounded around one hour into the battle while personally leading one of the PAVN attacks and died from his wounds a few hours later after nightfall. Phôi was the only high-ranking officer on either side killed in action during the battle at LZ Albany.

====American reinforcements arrive====
At 12:00, B-52s struck the areas further up north of LZ Albany and a battle damage assessment (BDA) was conducted by elements of the Cavalry in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3 Journal/IFFV, November 16 entry&quot;&gt;G3 Journal/IFFV, November 17 entry&lt;/ref&gt; At 14:55, Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry under Capt. Buse Tully began marching from LZ Columbus to the rear of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry column that was about away. By 16:30, they came into contact with the Alpha Company (1/5) perimeter under Capt. Forrest. A one-helicopter landing zone was secured and the wounded were evacuated. Tully&#x27;s men in 2/5 then began to push forward toward where the rest of the ambushed column would be. PAVN soldiers contested their advance and the Americans came under fire from a wood line. Tully&#x27;s men assaulted the tree line and drove off the PAVN. At 18:25, orders were received to secure into a two-company perimeter for the night. They planned to resume the advance at daybreak.

At around 16:00, Capt. Myron Diduryk&#x27;s Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, veterans of the fight at LZ X-Ray, got the word that they would be deployed in the battalion&#x27;s relief. At 18:45 the first helicopters swept over the Albany clearing and the troopers deployed into the tall grass. Lt. Rick Rescorla, the sole remaining platoon leader in Bravo Company, led the reinforcements into the Albany perimeter, which was expanded to provide better security. The wounded at Albany were evacuated at around 22:30 that evening, the helicopters receiving intense ground fire as they landed and took off. The Americans at Albany then settled down for the night.

===Day 5: November 18===
As Friday, November 18, dawned on the battlefield, U.S. soldiers began to gather up their dead comrades. This task took the better part of two days, as American and PAVN dead were scattered all over the field of battle. Rescorla described the scene as, &quot;a long, bloody traffic accident in the jungle.&quot; While securing the battlefield, Rescorla recovered a large, battered, old French army bugle from a dying PAVN soldier. The American soldiers finally left LZ Albany for LZ Crooks at , away, on November 19. The battle at LZ Albany cost the United States Army 155 men killed or missing and 124 wounded. One U.S. soldier, PFC Toby Braveboy, was recovered on November 24 when he waved down a passing Bell H-13 Sioux scout helicopter. About half of the approximately 300 American deaths in the 35 days of Operation Silver Bayonet occurred in this 16-hour fight. The United States reported 403 PAVN troops were killed in this battle and an estimated 150 were wounded, probably a large overestimation. Weapons captured included 112 rifles, 33 light machine-guns, three heavy machine-guns, two rocket launchers and four mortars.

==Effect and aftermath==
On the last day of the battle (November 18), General Westmoreland and General Cao Văn Viên, visited the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry. They were briefed by Lt. Col. Moore about the battle at LZ X-Ray. Westmoreland told them they were being recommended for a Presidential Unit Citation. They then flew to the 3rd Air Cavalry Brigade commanded by Col. Brown who gave them a briefing and they flew over the operation area. Before leaving Pleiku, they also had a meeting with General Vinh Loc, II Corps Commander and General Larsen, IFFV Commander who were involved in the battle at corps level. In this session, with Brown&#x27;s presence, they reviewed and agreed that the execution of the Battle of Ia Drang was in line with the National Campaign Plan developed by General Thang and General DePuy, the two J-3&#x27;s of the JGS and MACV. They then flew to Qui Nhơn and went to the hospital to visit the troops of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry who were wounded in the LZ Albany engagement. After the battle, Westmoreland instructed his J2 and J3 Chiefs to gain more improvements and &quot;to bring a B-52 strike down within seven hours after acquiring suitable intelligence&quot;.

As the fight at LZ Albany was coming to an end, the ARVN II Corps Command decided to &quot;finish off&quot; the campaign by introducing the ARVN Airborne Brigade into the battlefield on November 17 with the establishment of a new artillery support base at LZ Crooks, secured by the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry. The 5-day B-52 airstrike operation were carried on for two more days: on November 19, the carpet bombing aimed at the positions of units of the 66th and 33rd Regiments; and on November 20, units of the 32nd Regiment. The ARVN Airborne Brigade pursued the two remaining 635th and 334th Battalions of the 320th Regiments and executed two ambushes: the first on November 20 at the north side and the second on November 24 on the south side of the Ia Drang River. On November 26, with no further contact, the ARVN withdrew from the area.
A 1966 PAVN Central Highlands Front report claimed that in five major engagements with U.S. forces, PAVN forces suffered 559 soldiers killed and 669 wounded. PAVN histories claim the United States suffered 1,500 to 1,700 casualties during the Ia Drang Campaign. The official PAVN history claimed that the Plei Me Campaign, which included Ia Drang, eliminated 1,700 U.S. and 1,270 ARVN troops, shot down 59 helicopters, and destroyed 89 vehicles. The U.S. military confirmed 305 killed and 524 wounded (including 234 killed and 242 wounded between November 14 and 18, 1965), and claimed 3,561 PAVN were killed and more than 1,000 were wounded during engagements with the 1st Cavalry Division troops.

According to ARVN intelligence sources, each of the three PAVN regiments&#x27; initial strength was 2,200 soldiers: 1st Battalion-500, 2nd Battalion-500, 3rd Battalion-500, Mortar Company-150, Anti-Aircraft Company-150, Signal Company-120, Transportation Company-150, Medical Company-40, Engineer Company-60, Recon Company-50.

ARVN&#x27;s II Corps Command recapitulates the losses of the PAVN from 18 October to 26 November as follows: KIA (body count) 4,254, KIA (estimated) 2,270, WIA 1293, captured 179, weapons (crew served) 169, (individual) 1,027. PAVN casualty figures advanced by II Corps Command relied especially on PAVN regimental command posts&#x27; own loss reports (as indicated by Maj. Gen. Kinnard), intercepted by ARVN radio listening stations. Furthermore, they include PAVN troop casualties caused by the 5-day Arc Light airstrike that the PAVN and U.S. sides fail to take into account.

As the outcome of the entire campaign, the ARVN claimed that the PAVN were unable to achieve their objectives of overrunning the camp and destroying the relief column at Plei Me, which is confirmed in the B3 Front commander&#x27;s account, as well as that the entire B3 Field Force strength had been wiped out and the survivors pushed over the Cambodian border.

This battle can be seen as a blueprint for tactics by both sides. The Americans used air mobility, artillery fire and close air support to accomplish battlefield objectives. The PAVN learned that they could neutralize that firepower by quickly engaging American forces at very close range. PAVN Col. Nguyễn Hữu An included his lessons from the battle at X-ray in his orders for Albany, &quot;Move inside the column, grab them by the belt, and thus avoid casualties from the artillery and air.&quot; Both Westmoreland and An thought this battle to be a success. This battle was one of the few set piece battles of the war and was one of the first battles to popularize the U.S. concept of the &quot;body count&quot; as a measure of success, as the U.S. claimed that the kill ratio was nearly 10 to 1. The vast majority of casualties inflicted on US forces was through small-arms and light-mortar fire, with Moore noting the PAVN&#x27;s accurate shooting, well-placed ambushes and coordinated targeting of officers had overwhelmed U.S. positions in small-unit tactics. On the other hand, US forces had emerged from the battle by inflicting casualties through B-52 strikes, aerial rockets and artillery and relying on overwhelming firepower.

Both sides probably inflated the estimates of their opponent&#x27;s casualties. Lewy states that, according to DOD officials, US &quot;body count&quot; claims of PAVN/VC casualties were inflated at least 30 percent for the Vietnam War as a whole. The U.S. claim of 403 PAVN battle dead at Landing Zone Albany seems an overestimate. McDade (2/7) later claimed he did not report any estimate of PAVN casualties at LZ Albany and had not seen even 200 bodies of PAVN soldiers. Similarly, Moore also acknowledged that the PAVN casualty figures in the fight at LZ X-Ray were inaccurate. He lowered the original body count figure of 834 submitted by his men to 634, considering the former number too high.

In the late 1940s, Gen. Võ Nguyên Giáp wrote about the Việt Minh war against the French: &quot;The enemy will pass slowly from the offensive to the defensive. The blitzkrieg will transform itself into a war of long duration. Thus, the enemy will be caught in a dilemma: He has to drag out the war in order to win it and does not possess, on the other hand, the psychological and political means to fight a long-drawn-out war.&quot; After this battle, he said: &quot;We thought that the Americans must have a strategy. We did. We had a strategy of people&#x27;s war. You had tactics, and it takes very decisive tactics to win a strategic victory... If we could defeat your tactics — your helicopters — then we could defeat your strategy. Our goal was to win the war.&quot; 

Commenting later on the battle, Moore said, The &quot;peasant soldiers [of North Vietnam] had withstood the terrible high-tech fire storm delivered against them by a superpower and had at least fought the Americans to a draw. By their yardstick, a draw against such a powerful opponent was the equivalent of a victory.&quot;

===Casualties===
Both sides routinely exaggerated the number of casualties inflicted on the other, and figures vary considerably depending on source.

Four American helicopters were shot down and 55 damaged. One USAF A-1E Skyraider was hit by automatic weapons and crashed, killing the pilot.

According to ARVN, they lost 132 killed, 248 wounded, and 18 missing

===Casualty notification===
The U.S. Army had not set up casualty-notification teams this early in the war. The notification telegrams at this time were handed over to taxi cab drivers for delivery to the next of kin. Moore&#x27;s wife, Julia Compton Moore, followed in the wake of the deliveries to widows in the Fort Benning housing complex, grieving with the wives and comforting the children and attended the funerals of all the men killed under her husband&#x27;s command who were buried at Fort Benning. Her complaints about the notifications prompted the Army to quickly set up two-man teams to deliver them, consisting of an officer and a chaplain. Mrs. Frank Henry, the wife of the battalion executive officer and Mrs. James Scott, wife of the battalion command sergeant major, performed the same duty for the dead of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry.

==Notable award recipients==
Although many decorations have been awarded to veterans of the Battle of Ia Drang, in his book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...And Young&quot;, Lt. Gen. Harold Moore writes:

We had problems on the awards... Too many men had died bravely and heroically, while the men who had witnessed their deeds had also been killed... Acts of valor that, on other fields, on other days, would have been rewarded with the Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service Cross or a Silver Star were recognized only with a telegram saying,&quot;The Secretary of the Army regrets...&quot; The same was true of our sister battalion, the 2nd of the 7th.

; Medal of Honor

* 2nd Lt. Walter Marm, Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, received the Medal of Honor on Nov. 15, 1967, for his actions while serving as a platoon leader on 14 November during the 3-day battle at LZ X-Ray. His medal citation recounts exemplary acts of conspicuous gallantry, some of them performed while severely wounded.
* Helicopter pilots during the battle Capt. Ed Freeman and Maj. Bruce Crandall were each awarded the Medal of Honor on July 16, 2001, and Feb. 26, 2007, respectively, for Freeman&#x27;s 14 and Crandall&#x27;s 22 volunteer flights in their unarmed Hueys into LZ X-Ray while enemy fire was so heavy that medical evacuation helicopters refused to approach. With each flight, Crandall and Freeman delivered much needed water and ammunition and extracted wounded soldiers, saving countless lives.

; Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, and Bronze Star Medal

* Lt. Col. Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Moore, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at LZ X-Ray.

<text>The Sudan plated lizard (Broadleysaurus major), also known as the western plated lizard, great plated lizard, or Broadley&#x27;s rough-scaled plated lizard, is a medium-sized, diurnal African lizard.

==Description==

The Sudan plated lizard is a medium-sized lizard that can grow up to 20-24&quot; long, with the tail being less than half of total length. They have stout bodies, short limbs, and moderately broad tails.

This species is easily recognised by its heavily armored appearance. The body and tail is covered in transverse bands of more or less square plate-like keeled scales, and head shields are fused to the skull. The armour makes the animals look a bit like the uncommon perception of Mesozoic reptiles.

Coloration varies from tawny to grayish brown to dark brown with cream-colored spots or striping, with a pale underside. Males tend to be larger than females, and can develop bright-colored throats during breeding season.

==Distribution==

The Sudan plated lizard can be found in parts of eastern and central Africa, including the countries Tanzania (including the island archipelago of Zanzibar), Kenya and Mozambique. They prefer rocky, semi-open areas within coastal woodland, thicket, moist savannah, and dry savannah habitats. They seem to especially prefer rock piles and crevices.

== Diet ==
Sudan plated lizards are omnivores. Although they primarily eat insects, they also occasionally eat fruits, vegetation, and small vertebrates like small lizards and rodents. They also like fruits and vegetables in their diet.

==Captivity==

Plated lizards are typically very shy, but they are docile and can tame quickly with regular handling.

Individuals require a terrarium with dimensions of at least 48&quot;L x 24&quot;W x 24&quot;H, with bedding that allows them to dig and burrow. The enclosure should offer plenty of hiding places to help them feel secure.

The enclosure must have a daytime temperature of 70-85 °F, with a localized basking area with temperatures between 105 and 115 °F as measured by a digital probe thermometer or infrared thermometer. The enclosure should be allowed to cool down at night, but should not get colder than 60 °F. Sudan plated lizards should also be provided with a high quality T5 HO (desert) UVB lamp half the length of the enclosure and placed on the same side as the heat lamp. Although they are a fairly arid species, they do best when they have access to areas of higher humidity, up to 80%.

Sudan plated lizards will eat live crickets, dubia roaches, and other insects. For vegetation, they will take leafy greens such as collard greens, mustard greens, endive, escarole and spring mix, as well as carrots and grated sweet potato. Fruits such as mango pieces and berries can be used as treats. Citrus fruit (e.g. orange) and other acidic fruits should be avoided as this can cause stomach ulcers and digestion problems. Some keepers also treat their plated lizards with the occasional small pinkie mouse, depending on the size of the individual. A bowl of clean, fresh water should always be available.

<doc id="983135" wikidata="Q1514795" url="?curid=983135" title="Ivan Yates">
<text>Ivan Yates (born 23 October 1959) is an Irish broadcaster, businessman and former politician. He was elected as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wexford constituency at the 1981 general election and at each election until his retirement from politics in 2002. He also served as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry from 1994 to 1997.

==Early life==
Yates was born in Enniscorthy, County Wexford. He was educated at Aravon School, Bray; St. Columba&#x27;s Church of Ireland College in Rathfarnham, Dublin; and Gurteen College, County Tipperary.

==Political career==
When he was first elected in 1981, Yates was the youngest member of the 22nd Dáil and is also the fifth-youngest ever member of Dáil Éireann at the age of 21. He became involved in local politics when he became a member of Wexford County Council, serving until 1995 and again from 1999 to 2004. He joined the Fine Gael front bench in 1988 and was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry when the party came to power in 1994.

Yates oversaw a particularly difficult period for Irish agriculture. Farmers saw the prices they received for their produce plummet; he stopped live animal exports in response to controversy over cruelty in shipping, and took on the Irish Veterinary Union over the tuberculosis eradication scheme. He also had to deal with a sharp rise in the number of BSE cases during 1996, and the consequent banning of Irish beef by Russia. When John Bruton resigned as leader of Fine Gael in January 2001, there was much speculation that Yates would be a contender for the vacant position. Instead, he announced to his colleagues that he was leaving full-time politics to concentrate on his family and business interests and that he would not be contesting the next general election.

He receives annual pension payments of €74,836 from his time in politics.

==Business career==
Yates was the chairman and managing director of Celtic Bookmakers, an Irish chain of betting shops, and expanded the company from its Wexford base to a chain of 64 shops around the country at its peak. On 4 January 2011, it was announced that the company had gone into receivership.

He headed a group of bookmakers in a court case against the British Horseracing Board (BHB) over fees for licences to access a racing information database in 2005. The issue was resolved in the High Court with the termination of the BHB&#x27;s licence agreement and a payment of €300,000 to the bookmakers, who were reported to have access to the BHB&#x27;s former database until 9 January 2006.

In 2011, he described the Irish bankruptcy process as &quot;purgatory&quot;, and publicly announced that he was contemplating moving to the UK to avail of the British bankruptcy process.

On 21 August 2012, the High Court in Dublin dismissed an attempt by Allied Irish Banks to have him declared bankrupt.

In September 2013, it was announced that Yates was discharged from bankruptcy, having fulfilled the requirements set down by Swansea County Court, where he made his application for personal insolvency on 24 August 2012.

==Media work==
Yates co-presented the Newstalk breakfast show from 2009, firstly with Claire Byrne and subsequently with Chris Donoghue. On 23 March 2012, he announced he would be leaving both the station and his column in the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; with effect from 6 April 2012, to concentrate on his personal finances. He also presented &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; on TV3 during summer 2011.

He returned to Newstalk in September 2013, once again co-presenting the breakfast show with Chris Donoghue.

Yates is a regular conference speaker, motivational speaker and MC at business events in Ireland. He is a client of Noel Kelly, of NK Management.

Yates co-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on TV3 and presented &quot;The Hard Shoulder&quot; on Newstalk until his retirement from broadcasting in July 2020. Kieran Cuddihy replaced Yates as the host of &quot;The Hard Shoulder&quot; in September 2020.

<text>Nora Owen (; born 1 June 1945) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Justice from 1994 to 1997 and Deputy leader of Fine Gael from 1993 to 2001. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North constituency from 1981 to 1987 and 1989 to 2002.

She was a presenter of TV3&#x27;s topical programme &quot;Midweek&quot;.

==Early life==
Owen was born in Dublin in 1945. She is a sister of Mary Banotti and a grandniece of the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins. She was educated at Dominican Convent, County Wicklow and University College Dublin (UCD) where she qualified as an industrial chemist.

==Political career==
Owen was first elected to Dublin County Council in 1979 for the Malahide local electoral area. She was later elected as a Fine Gael TD for the first time in 1981, serving until the 1987 election when she lost her seat. That year she became a member of the executive of Trócaire. She returned to Dáil Éireann following the 1989 general election. In 1993, she became Deputy leader of Fine Gael. The following year she became Minister for Justice, remaining in that post until 1997. She undertook a significant programme of criminal law reform. Among the major changes she implemented was the referendum on bail in 1996, leading to the Bail Act, of 1997, which allows a court to refuse bail to those charged with a serious offence where it is considered necessary to prevent them committing a serious offence. Journalist Veronica Guerin was murdered in 1996 and in its aftermath, Owen introduced the highly successful Criminal Assets Bureau to crack down on organised crime. In 2002, she became the first high-profile Fine Gael TD to lose her seat in Dublin North in the party&#x27;s disastrous general election result.

==Post-political life==
Owen is the patron of the Collins 22 Society, which works to keep the memory and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. She occasionally works as an election pundit. In August 2011, it was announced she was to present the Irish version of &quot;Mastermind&quot; on TV3.

==Political career==
He began his political career when he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin South-West at the 1965 general election. He held a seat for the party in the constituency until a revision of constituencies in 1977, when he was elected for Dublin Ballyfermot. At the first direct elections in 1979 to the European Parliament, he was elected with his running mate Michael O&#x27;Leary to the Dublin constituency.

There was a further revision of constituencies at the 1981 general election. He failed to be selected as a Labour Party candidate for Dublin South-Central with party leader Frank Cluskey. O&#x27;Connell was encouraged to stand in Dublin West but refused. He contested Dublin South-Central as an independent candidate, topping the poll, while Cluskey lost his seat.

When the 22nd Dáil met in June 1981, O&#x27;Connell was elected as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann. He resigned from the European Parliament. In March 1982, at the beginning of the 23rd Dáil, he was again elected as Ceann Comhairle. However, in December 1982, when the 24th Dáil met, his nomination to the position was unsuccessful, being defeated by Fine Gael TD Tom Fitzpatrick. As outgoing Ceann Comhairle, O&#x27;Connell was returned automatically in the two elections of 1982.

He remained an independent TD until February 1985, when he joined Fianna Fáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the 1987 general election. That year he was one of those nominated by the Taoiseach Charles Haughey to the 18th Seanad, serving until he regained his Dáil seat at the 1989 general election.

Following Albert Reynolds&#x27; resignation from cabinet, O&#x27;Connell supported him and is seen as one of those who helped persuade Haughey to resign when he did. O&#x27;Connell was appointed Minister for Health by Reynolds in 1992. He remained as Minister for Health until 1993, when owing to ill-health, he retired from cabinet and then resigned from the Dáil.

Further controversy surrounded O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s relationship with Charles Haughey in later years. It was revealed during the Moriarty Tribunal firstly that O&#x27;Connell was the middleman for donations from Arab tycoon Mahmoud Fustok to Haughey; and secondly that O&#x27;Connell had invested a significant sum in Celtic Helicopters, a business venture owned by Haughey&#x27;s son Ciarán.

In the 1970s he arranged a meeting in his home between Harold Wilson MP, then leader of the British Labour Party, and Dáithí Ó Conaill, a member of the Provisional IRA Army Council. Negotiations that night to broker a ceasefire were successful in the short term but ultimately broke down.

In 1988 he published a memoir, &quot;Doctor John: crusading doctor and politician&quot;.

<text>John Loewen (; born December 21, 1949) is a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2005 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, and campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in 2006 and 2008 as a Liberal. He is the nephew of Bill and Shirley Loewen, prominent entrepreneurs and philanthropists in Winnipeg.

==Early life and career==

Loewen was born in Elkhorn, Manitoba, and raised in Winnipeg. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba in 1973. Tall and athletic, Loewen was a prominent member of the University of Manitoba Bisons basketball team. He joined the payroll services company Comcheq Services Ltd. (now called Ceridian) in 1973. He later served as company president from 1984 until 1998.

In 1993, Loewen oversaw Comcheq&#x27;s transformation into a subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). There were concerns that the Winnipeg company&#x27;s autonomy would be undermined by the national bank, but the CIBC initially allowed it to remain fairly independent. Loewen attempted to reacquire the company in 1998, but was unsuccessful.

Loewen has for many years been a prominent figure supporting Manitoba&#x27;s sports community. He developed a plan to financially support the province&#x27;s Olympic athletes in the early 1990s, and helped establish the Winnipeg Thunder basketball team in 1992 with future mayor Sam Katz. He has also provided financial assistance to several athletic programs. In 1994, a newspaper columnist in Winnipeg described Comcheq as &quot;probably the most generous private-sector supporter of elite athletes in the province&quot;.

Loewen helped create the Manitoba Entertainment Complex group (MEC) in 1994, in an effort to purchase controlling shares in the Winnipeg Jets hockey franchise and keep the team in the city. Loewen chaired the MEC, and participated in plans to build a new arena for the team. Despite his efforts, the Jets were forced to leave the city in 1996. Loewen argued that the National Hockey League and commissioner Gary Bettman undermined his efforts, by presenting unreasonable demands shortly before an official deadline. In 2006, he indicated that the major-level investors necessary for maintaining a National Hockey League franchise simply did not exist in Winnipeg in the mid-1990s.

Loewen has been a board member and chairman of Economic Development Winnipeg, a council member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Manitoba, a board member and president of the Big Brothers and Sisters Association of Winnipeg and president of both the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra and the Linden Woods Community Association. He has also been involved with the United Way of Winnipeg, serving on the United Way Cabinet from 1994 until 1999 as Chair of the Major Corporate Division and Deputy Chair of Business. He is a founding Director of the Business Council of Manitoba.

There were rumours that Loewen would run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1998, but he declined.

Until 2012 John Loewen was the President of Telpay, an electronic payments company which was originally started as a research and development project by Comcheq. Telpay is the largest independent payment processing company in Canada having processed over 23 million payments worth over $14 billion in 2009.

==Provincial politics==

Loewen entered political life in Manitoba&#x27;s 1999 provincial election, winning election for the newly created south Winnipeg constituency of Fort Whyte. Running as a Progressive Conservative, he defeated New Democrat Bidhu Jha by 3,665 votes. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Loewen became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Official Opposition. He was appointed as his party&#x27;s critic for Intergovernmental Affairs, and was later promoted to Finance Critic. Considered a rising star in his party, there was some speculation that he would run to succeed Gary Filmon as party leader in 2000. He decided against this when the party establishment united behind Stuart Murray.

He was a moderate in the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party, and supported the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Canada rather than the right-wing Canadian Alliance at the federal level, even though many of his colleagues backed the Alliance. In 2001, Loewen was the only member of the provincial PC caucus to attend a Winnipeg fundraiser for federal PC leader Joe Clark. In the same year, he criticized the provincial New Democratic government of Gary Doer for not going far enough in extending rights to same-sex couples.

Loewen became involved a serious controversy in early 2002, after issuing a media notice that was strongly critical of Manitoba&#x27;s Crocus investment portfolio. He wrote that the company held investments &quot;in a number of Manitoba companies&quot; that were &quot;in financial difficulty&quot;, and requested that the government ask the Auditor General to review the valuation of the fund. His statement was met with strong opposition from Crocus, which threatened legal action. Loewen was subsequently demoted from his position as Finance Critic by Stuart Murray, and was required to make a formal apology to the legislature in April 2002. Almost three years later, Crocus stopped trading and was forced into receivership. Many believe Loewen&#x27;s concerns were vindicated by the trust&#x27;s eventual failure. Loewen criticized several parties, including the government, opposition and senior Crocus management, when discussing the firm&#x27;s failure in a 2007 interview.

He was re-elected in the 2003 election by a slightly reduced margin. In late 2003, he introduced a bill to phase out Video Lottery Terminals from the province.

==Federal politics==

The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada merged with the Canadian Alliance in early 2004 to create the Conservative Party of Canada. Loewen initially supported the new party, but announced on September 23, 2005 that he would seek the federal Liberal nomination for Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia in the upcoming federal election. In making the announcement, Loewen said he was uncomfortable with the social conservatism of Conservative leader Stephen Harper, and that he &quot;never believed in the policies of the former Alliance and Reform parties&quot; which he described as &quot;dominat[ing] the [Conservative] party&quot;. He resigned from the provincial legislature on September 26, 2005, and subsequently beat Gennarino Conte for the Liberal nomination. He lost to Conservative incumbent Steven Fletcher in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives gained twenty-five seats to form a minority government. Loewen acknowledged that the national trend worked against his candidacy.

After the election, Loewen returned to the board of TelPay, formerly a division of Comcheq. He is also a partner in Payworks, an internet based payroll service. As a volunteer, he is leading the fund raising efforts for construction of the North End Wellness Centre in Winnipeg.

In 2007, Loewen was acclaimed as the Liberal candidate for Winnipeg South. He lost to Conservative incumbent Rod Bruinooge in the 2008 federal election.

<text>RWD was a Polish aircraft construction bureau active between 1928 and 1939. It started as a team of three young designers, Stanisław Rogalski, Stanisław Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki, whose names formed the RWD acronym.

==History==

They started work while studying at Warsaw University of Technology. In December 1925, with some other student constructors, they set up workshops at the Aviation Section of Mechanics Students&#x27; Club (&quot;Sekcja Lotnicza Koła Mechaników Studentów&quot;), where they manufactured their first designs. From 1926 they designed several aircraft alone (Drzewiecki JD-2 and WR-1), in 1928 they joined forces as one team, starting with RWD-1 sportsplane. Apart from building planes, J. Drzewiecki was a test pilot of their designs, while S. Wigura flew as a mechanic in competitions. In 1930 the team was moved to new workshops at Okęcie district in Warsaw, near the Okęcie aerodrome, today&#x27;s Warsaw International Airport, founded by the LOPP paramilitary organization. On 11 September 1932, Stanisław Wigura died in an air crash in the RWD-6 during a storm, but the RWD name continued to be used for new designs (according to a popular story, the letter W now &quot;de facto&quot; stood for engineer Jerzy Wędrychowski, but he was not a designer). In 1933, Rogalski, Drzewiecki and Wędrychowski founded the company &quot;Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze&quot; (DWL, Experimental Aeronautical Works) in Warsaw, which became a manufacturer of further RWD aircraft. Apart from Rogalski and Drzewiecki, the construction bureau employed designers Tadeusz Chyliński, Bronisław Żurakowski, Leszek Dulęba and Andrzej Anczutin and several engineers, including Henryk Millicer.
At first, the RWD team designed and built light sport planes. Early designs RWD-2 and RWD-4 were built in small series and used in Polish sports aviation, including their debut at the Challenge 1930 international contest. Their next designs performed particularly well in competitions - the RWD-6 won the Challenge 1932 and RWD-9s won the Challenge 1934 international contest. The RWD-5 sport plane was the lightest plane to fly across the Atlantic in 1933. Three types saw mass production: the RWD-8, which became the Polish Air Force&#x27;s basic trainer, the RWD-13 touring plane and the RWD-14 Czapla reconnaissance plane (1938).

Other important designs were the RWD-10 aerobatic plane (1933), RWD-17 aerobatic-trainer plane (1937) and RWD-21 light sport plane (1939). World War II prevented further development and serial production of later RWD designs, and put an end to the RWD construction bureau and the DWL production plant.

<text>Niamh Síle Bhreathnach (; 1 June 1945 – 6 February 2023) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Education from 1993 to 1994 and 1994 to 1997.

She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1992 to 1997. She was a senator from June 1997 to July 1997, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Early life and education==
Niamh Síle Bhreathnach was born in Loughlinstown, Dublin, on 1 June 1945. She was the daughter of Breandán Breathnach, a civil servant and collector of traditional music. She was educated at Dominican College Sion Hill and Froebel College of Education, Dublin, later qualifying as a remedial teacher.

== Career ==
Bhreathnach sought election for the first time in 1985, standing in the local electoral area of Blackrock at the 1985 Dublin County Council election. Bhreathnach was chairperson of the Labour Party from 1990 until 1993. She was first elected to Dublin County Council at the 1991 election.

Bhreathnach was elected as a TD for Dún Laoghaire at the 1992 general election, serving until her defeat at the 1997 general election. In January 1993, she was appointed minister for education in the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government, serving until Labour left government in November 1994. She was appointed to the same post in December 1994 in the Rainbow Coalition, serving until June 1997. 

During her time as minister, the first white paper on Education was published, tuition fees for third-level institutions were abolished, and the Regional Technical Colleges were upgraded to Institutes of Technology. She also brought in the legacy posts, extra teaching positions for disadvantaged schools. She introduced the University Act 1997, which made universities accountable for the public money they receive.

After losing her Dáil seat in 1997, Bhreathnach was nominated by the outgoing Taoiseach, John Bruton, to the last days of the 20th Seanad. She sought a nomination from the Labour Party for the elections to the 21st Seanad, and there was some surprise when she was not one of the five candidates nominated by the party. She did not seek a nomination from the nominating bodies.

Bhreathnach stood again for the Dáil at the 2002 general election, but did not regain her seat, and did not contest the 2007 general election. She was a member of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council for the Blackrock local electoral area from 2004 to 2014.

== Personal life and death ==
Bhreathnach was married to Tom Ferris, with whom she had two children. Bhreathnach died in Blackrock, Dublin, on 6 February 2023, at age 77.

<text>Zollino (Griko: , ; Salentino: ) is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; of 2,194 inhabitants in the province of Lecce in Apulia, Italy. It is one of the nine towns of Grecìa Salentina, which still keeps Greek language and traditions.

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as indicated by the presence dolmens and menhir structures. The exact origin of its foundation is uncertain: one theory suggests Zollino was established as a Iapygian colony from the nearby village of Apigliano. Another theory proposes that Zollino began as a rural settlement of people from the nearby town of Soleto, from which its ancient name Solino is believed to have originated. In ancient times, Zollino was an important trade centre between the Ionian and the Adriatic coasts.

During the Middle Ages, Zollino was part of the County of Lecce, established by the Hauteville Normands. In 1190, King Tancred of Sicily granted the village to Baron Berlinghiero Chiaromonte. Under Swabian rule, Zollino became integrated into the County of Soleto. 

In the Angevin period, Zollino was again incorporated into the territory of Lecce. In 1384, Mary of Enghien included Zollino as part of her dowry upon her marriage to Raimondo Orsini del Balzo, Count of Soleto. Following Orsini&#x27;s ascension to the title of Prince of Taranto, Zollino became part of the Principality of Taranto, remaining under its jurisdiction until 1463, when Giovanni Antonio Orsini del Balzo, son of Raimondello, passed away without heirs.

After his death, the Chiaromonte family, led by Tristan of Clermont, retained feudal rights over Zollino through his marriage to Catherine of Taranto, the daughter of Raimondello. Over time, the village passed through several noble families, until the abolition of the feudal system in 1806. The Greek Rite was practiced in Zollino until the 16th century.

<text>Melpignano (Griko: ; Salentino: ) is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Lecce in Apulia, Italy. It is one of the nine towns of Grecìa Salentina. Melpignano has a population of 2,209 inhabitants (called Melpignanesi) and an area of , thus showing a population density of 202,1 inhabitants per square kilometer. The comune rises above sea level.

There are 84 industrial firms employing 474 people who are 60.69% of the total of the workers. There are 50 service firms employing 165 people who are 21.13% of the total of the workers. There are 39 firms employing 89 people who are 11.40% of the total of the workers. There are 23 administrative offices employing 53 workers who are 6.79% of the total of the workers.

The people of Melpignano, alongside Italian, also speak Griko, a Greek dialect. The language, folklore, traditions and history of Calimera, like those of the eight other cities in the area called &quot;Salentine Greece&quot;, reveal significant Greek influences over the course of time, presumably from the time of the Byzantine control, or even the ancient Magna Graecia colonisation in the 8th century BCE.

<doc id="983186" wikidata="Q3077746" url="?curid=983186" title="Fairy godmother">
<text>In fairy tales, a fairy godmother () is a fairy with magical powers who acts as a mentor or parent to someone, in the role that an actual godparent was expected to play in many societies. In Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;, he concludes the tale with the moral that no personal advantages will suffice without proper connections.

The fairy godmother is a special case of the donor.

==In fairy tales and legends==
Actual fairy godmothers are rare in fairy tales but became familiar figures because of the popularity of the literary fairy tales of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy and other précieuses, and Charles Perrault. Many other supernatural patrons feature in fairy tales; these include various kinds of animals and the spirit of a dead mother. The fairy godmother has her roots in the figures of the Fates; this is especially clear in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, where they decree her fate, and are associated with spinning.

In the tales of précieuses and later successors, the fairy godmother acts in a manner atypical of fairies in actual folklore belief; they are preoccupied with the character and fortunes of their human protegees, whereas fairies in folklore have their interests.

Typically, the fairy godmother&#x27;s protégé is a prince or princess, who is the protagonist of the story, and the godparent uses her magic to help or otherwise support them. The most well-known example is probably the fairy godmother in Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Eight fairy godmothers appear in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in Charles Perrault&#x27;s version and in the Grimm Brothers&#x27; version titled &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, the thirteen godmothers are called Wise Women. The popularity of these versions of these tales led to this being widely regarded as a common fairy-tale motif, although they are less common in other tales.

Indeed, the fairy godmothers were added to &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; by Perrault; no such figures appeared in his source, &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot; by Giambattista Basile.

While fairy godmothers are traditionally portrayed as kind, gentle, and loving, there are exceptions. In &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, a fairy not invited to the royal christening curses the eponymous princess to die from pricking her finger on a spindle, only for one of the invited fairies to alter the spell into a century-long slumber. In Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, the Prince&#x27;s evil fairy godmother had not only turned him into a Beast for rejecting her marriage proposal but had even attempted to seduce his uncle, a king whose daughter (Beauty) a good fairy switched at birth with a merchant&#x27;s dead baby because said godmother tried to have the princess killed.

==Précieuses==
In the works of the précieuses, French literary fairy tales, fairy godmothers act much as actual godmothers did among their social circles, exerting their benefits for their godchildren, but expecting respect in return.

Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy created a fairy godmother for the evil stepsister in her fairy tale &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;; in this position, the fairy godmother&#x27;s attempts to bring about the marriage of her goddaughter and the hero are evil attempts to impede his marriage with the heroine. Likewise, in &quot;The White Doe&quot;, the fairy godmother helps the evil princess get revenge on the heroine. In &quot;Finette Cendron&quot;, the fairy godmother is the heroine&#x27;s, but after helping her in the early portion of the tale, she is offended when Finette Cendron does not take her advice, and Finette must work through the second part with little assistance from her.

In Henriette-Julie de Murat&#x27;s &quot;Bearskin&quot;, the heroine has a fairy godmother, but she is offended that the heroine&#x27;s marriage was arranged without consulting her, and refuses to assist.

==In fiction==

Fairy godmothers appear frequently in fairytale fantasy, especially comic versions and retellings of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Mercedes Lackey presents a gently lampooned version of the concept in her Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms series, in which Fairy Godmothers are magically gifted women who monitor magical forces across the kingdoms. Whenever events are right for a fairy tale to recur, the relevant Fairy Godmother steps in to make sure that the tale in question runs its course with as few fatalities as possible.

* In William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Rose and the Ring&quot;, the fairy Blackstick concludes that her gifts have not done her godchildren good; in particular, she has given two of her goddaughters the title ring and the title rose, which have the power to make whoever owns them beautiful, which have ruined the character of those goddaughters; with the next prince and princess, she gives them &quot;a little misfortune&quot;, which proves the best gift, as their difficulties form their characters.
* In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, when Uncle Andrew explains how he made the magical rings from dust left to him by his godmother, he points out that she may have had fairy blood, and so he might have been the last man to have a fairy godmother.
* In the television animated Halloween special &quot;Witch&#x27;s Night Out&quot;, the witch is mistaken for a &quot;fairy godmother&quot; by the two children, Small and Tender. Their sitter, Bazooey corrects them by addressing the fairy godmother as a &quot;wicked witch&quot;.
* &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; is an animated comedy TV series where the fairies Cosmo and Wanda are (rather incompetent) godparents.
* In &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, the Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) who appears is a conniving, crooked businesswoman (with a personality rather like that of the Stepmother in Cinderella), who is quite willing to resort to blackmail and/or murder to further her interests. The pure reason for helping princesses gain a happily ever after with Prince Charming is the fact that Prince Charming is the Fairy Godmother&#x27;s son, and through the marriage, he will gain the throne. She also said to Shrek that she strongly believes that ogres don&#x27;t live happily ever after.
* In the &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;, fairy godmothers are a type of witch. The main antagonist is a plotting fairy godmother, Lady Lilith de Tempscire (Lily, the sister of witch Granny Weatherwax), who uses the power of stories and mirror magic to control the city of Genua. Magrat Garlick becomes fairy godmother to Ella Saturday (the rightful ruler of Genua) following the death of Desiderata Hollow but throws away the magic wand at the end (as she was unable to use it for any purpose other than turning objects into pumpkins).
* In &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; novels (primarily &quot;Grave Peril&quot; and &quot;Summer Knight&quot;), the main character, a modern wizard named Harry Dresden is revealed to have a faerie godmother by the name of Leanansidhe who enjoys ensnaring Harry in one-sided deals.
* &quot;Once Upon a Midnight&quot; features the character of Angelica, the Blue Fairy, an overzealous fairy godmother.
* Fairy Godmother plays a leading role in the web series &quot;Wish It Inc.&quot; She is portrayed by &quot;Portal&quot; voice actress Ellen McLain.
* The first &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; game features a fairy godmother of the main character Graham who can grant him invincibility.
* The otome game &quot;My Candy Love&quot; features a fairy godmother who will appear randomly and give the player gifts. She is a bit of an odd case in that she is implied to be an eccentric aunt who merely dresses as a fairy godmother.
* In the TV series &quot;True Blood&quot;, Season 4, Episode 1, the character Sookie learns of her fairy heritage, including that she has a godmother who is a blood relative on her fairy side.
* In the film &quot;Maleficent&quot;, Princess Aurora, the Sleeping Beauty, mistakenly assumes Maleficent to be this, as the latter had been watching out for her since she was little, though Princess Aurora doesn&#x27;t know about her curse or the person who cast it.
* In the fourth season of the superhero series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, the team hunts magical creatures across time that have escaped from Mallus&#x27; realm. One of the creatures is Tabitha (portrayed by Jane Carr), the fairy godmother of a girl in 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts. She is later revealed to be a lover of Neron and later tricks Nora Darkh into becoming the new fairy godmother. Tabitha helps Neron in his plan to open a portal to hell and attacks the Legends with a dragon called Wickstable, which originally hatched in young Zari Tomaz&#x27;s possession, at Heyworld. When young Zari regains control of Wickstable, the dragon eats Tabitha before regressing to a baby dragon.

<text>Soleto (Griko: ; Salentino: ; ) is a small Griko-speaking city located in the province of Lecce in Apulia, Italy. The town has a total population of 5,542 and is one of the nine towns of Grecìa Salentina where the Greek dialect Griko is spoken.

==History==
In the 5th century, Soleto was elevated to the seat of a bishopric of the Byzantine Rite. In the Middle Ages it was ruled by Count Gjon Kastrioti II, son of the Albanian national hero Gjergj Kastrioti. In the 13th century the Angevine rulers of Naples chose the city as the capital of a county, later ruled by the Castro, Balzo, Orsini, Campofregoso, Castriota, Sanseverino, Carafa, and Gallarati-Scotti families, until feudal control was finally abolished in 1806. Soleto became part of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799 and was a center of the Carboneria during the Italian Risorgimento.

==Soleto Map==
The Soleto Map, the oldest geographical map in the Western world, was discovered in Soleto by Belgian archaeologist Thierry van Compernolle of Montpellier University on 21 August 2003.

<text>Prospect Bluff Historic Sites (until 2016 known as Fort Gadsden Historic Site, and sometimes written as Fort Gadsden Historic Memorial) is located in Franklin County, Florida, on the Apalachicola River, SW of Sumatra, Florida. The site contains the ruins of two forts.

The earlier and larger one was built by the British in 1814, during the War of 1812. They allowed the members of the disbanded Corps of Colonial Marines, made up largely of fugitive slaves, and Creek tribesmen to occupy it after the British evacuated Florida in 1815, deliberately leaving their munitions behind. At that point, since the British had not named it, Americans started referring to it as Negro Fort. It was destroyed in a river attack from U.S. forces in 1816.

Fort Gadsden was built in 1818 within the former walls of the former Negro Fort.

The site has been known by several other names at various times, including Prospect Bluff, British post, Nicholls&#x27; Fort, Blount&#x27;s Fort, Fort Blount, African Fort, and Fort Apalachicola. The local natives called the land Achackwheithle.

Listed in the National Register of Historic Places and named a National Historic Landmark in 1972, the Prospect Bluff Historic Sites was acquired by the Apalachicola National Forest in 1940 and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The process of memorializing the site began in 1961, when the Apalachicola National Forest issued the State of Florida a term special use permit for an area of approximately including the site to be run as a state park. Administration of the site reverted to the federal government in the 1990s. The site contains interpretive signage, picnic area with pavilion, and rest rooms.

== Prospect Bluff==
The site of both Negro Fort and the later Fort Gadsden was Prospect Bluff, &quot;a fine bluff overlooking the Apalachicola River,&quot; whose modest elevation of and the swamp that almost surrounded it (description below) gave it a natural military strength. The name parallels the Spanish one, &quot;Loma de Buena Vista&quot;, literally &quot;hill with a good view&quot;.

Accessible only by river then, the site was and is still remote. The river was the boundary between East Florida and West Florida during the British Florida period (1763–1783) and the second Spanish Florida period (1783–1821). By modern land route it is from Pensacola and from St. Augustine. The area was sparsely populated, and in the twentieth century a large portion became the Apalachicola National Forest. The river was of intense interest to the British, who saw it as an undefended entry into the United States through Georgia. It was of no interest to the Spaniards; it led nowhere they cared about. Spanish forces in Florida were limited and Spain was far less committed to Florida than it was to its other colonies, most of them much more productive. Spain&#x27;s inability to police its borders or return fugitive slaves was central to Florida&#x27;s transfer to the United States in 1821.

Control of Prospect Bluff meant control of the river, which had served as a transportation artery for centuries. More recently, it had enabled raiding parties to go upriver into Georgia and the Mississippi Territory via the Chattahoochee and especially the Flint River. The attacks were made on plantations, which had few if any defenses. These parties, besides coming back with material goods, saw to it that the slaves of the raided plantations could get free. This was a great economic blow to the slave owners (slaves were expensive), and an ideological affront as well, leaving them insecure and angry.

Prospect Bluff was valuable militarily not only because of the elevation its name suggests, but because it was at a &quot;strategic location&quot;, a bend in the river, giving an important sight advantage over any boat.

== Before 1814==
The Florida panhandle was mostly wilderness before 1814. Its population at the time is unknown, except for isolated reports. As in the rest of Florida, there were many Native American refugees from the United States, who merged into a new ethnicity, Seminoles. It provided excellent cover for escaped slaves, who, since they shared a common enemy, got along with the Seminoles fairly well; &quot;over time, a bond developed between escaped Africans and the Seminoles that only increased with time and white pressure for their return&quot;. Some became black Seminoles. There was &quot;reciprocal respect and affection&quot;; the former slaves, who knew English, served as interpreters. This predecessor of the Underground Railroad ran south. The biggest issue about the area discussed by whites was how to get escaped slaves back, or get compensation for them, and prevent or reduce future escapes. The return of Native Americans was unwanted, and they were soon forcibly removed from Florida as well.

As was customary in pre-railroad times, settlement took place first along rivers. The name Apalachicola River derives its name from Apalachicola Province on what is now the Chattahoochee River (the Spanish regarded what is now the Chattahoochee as part of the Apalachicola River). Settlement at Prospect Bluff by maroons (escaped slaves and their descendants), Seminoles, and a few Europeans is documented at the end of the eighteenth century.

In January 1783 a conference was held in St. Augustine between the representatives of the British Crown—Governor Patrick Tonyn, Brigadier General Archibald McArthur, and Thomas Brown, the superintendent of Indian affairs—and the head men and principal warriors of the towns of the Upper and the Lower Creeks, who complained of the long distance they must travel to the stores from which they obtained their supplies. The Indians offered protection to merchants who would move their stores to locations closer to their territory, and pointed out the Apalachicola River as a suitable place for a trading house. The Creeks said it was not only more convenient for themselves, but also much nearer to the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee Indians, and requested that the house of Panton, Leslie &amp; Company, who had been supplying them with goods, should be solicited to settle there for that purpose.

William Panton was present at the conference, and agreed with the Indians to establish a store at such a place as he or his co-partners might find suitable between the forks of Flint river and the mouth of the Apalachicola River, provided that letters of license were issued to him and his partners. The agreement was confirmed by the Crown, and the traders were granted the necessary license. Their store opened in 1784, by which time Spain had regained possession of Florida, at Fort San Marcos de Apalache (modern St. Marks, Florida). This store was attacked and looted by the adventurer William Augustus Bowles in 1792 and again in 1800, at which point it ceased operations.

A trading post run by John Forbes and Company, successors to Panton, Leslie &amp; Company, was set up in 1804 at the more defensible Prospect Bluff at the request of &quot;Indians&quot; (&quot;Mickosuckees&quot; is the only ethnicity mentioned). It was &quot;manned by Edmund Doyle with some assistance from William Hambly, an Indian trader with years of experience in the area.&quot; Doyle and Hambly &quot;each owned plantations higher up the river, at Spanish Bluff on the west bank and near present-day Bristol on the east bank.&quot; 

The site of the trading post was inside the walls of the Fort, built around it; this explains why the precise site has never been identified. It included a building for storing hides (what the Native Americans had to trade), quarters for negro slaves, and a cow pen for several hundred cattle that were raised nearby. During the War of 1812, British troops ransacked the store and freed the slaves.

Figures on the number of maroons who settled in the surrounding area range from 300 to 1,000.
The blacks developed plantations extending up to 50 miles along the river. A report from 1812 mentions over 36 cleared acres and 1,200 cattle, and they lived in &quot;large and well-built cabins&quot;. Their crops were peas, beans, corn, and rice.

== British Post (1814–15) ==
Construction of the fort began in May 1814, when the British seized the trading post of John Forbes and Company.

The British launched an invasion of Pensacola during the War of 1812 and occupied it until General Andrew Jackson took the town on November 7, 1814. The British forces, over 100 officers and men led by a Brevet Captain of the Royal Marines, George Woodbine, made camp at the only community between Pensacola and St. Marks: the trading post of John Forbes and Company, surrounded by negro plantations.

It was located at Prospect Bluff. Woodbine began to train local Native Americans as well as escaped slaves. Nicolls recruited the ex-slaves into the new (black) Corps of Colonial Marines. They were well-armed, well-equipped, and underwent drills; many had been in training for months. He also assembled and trained more than five hundred Creek and Seminole Indians by February 1815, but they came from a different culture, did not like being trained, and did not have the incentive of being protected from American re-enslavement. Nicolls found the ex-slaves superior as soldiers, reporting that his black recruits had enlisted &quot;with the strictest good faith and conduct, so much so, that out of 1,500 of them I never had occasion to punish one of them&quot;. He added that in contrast with British soldiers, &quot;they would not get drunk&quot;.

They were preparing to attack Georgia when news arrived of the end of the war. The British paid off the Colonial Marines (at the same rate as the white Marines) and withdrew from Florida. On May 16, 1815, the British evacuated the last of the garrison there.

Blacks and Native Americans under Nicolls&#x27; direction built two forts on the Apalachicola River. The larger and more important one was to be on the border of Georgia, at the juncture of the Flint and the Chattahoochee Rivers, in modern Chattahoochee, Florida, and was to serve as the base for a U.S. invasion. Time only permitted the construction of a small wooden structure, which Nicolls called Fort Apalachicola, but is today referred to as Nicolls&#x27; Outpost.

The larger one, which actually was built and was intended to be a supply depot for Nicolls&#x27; Outpost, did not have a name; it was referred to simply as the British Post. It was above the river mouth and south of Nicolls&#x27; Outpost and the border of Georgia. The construction of the larger fort was described by Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines in a letter of May 14, 1816 to Andrew Jackson, who had charged him with destroying the Fort:The ramparts and parapets built of hewn timber filled in with earth, mounting 9 to 12 pieces of Cannon, several of which are very large, with some mortars and Howitzers. It has a deep ditch intended to be filled with water, but was dry when seen by my informants, two or three months ago. The work is nearly square and extends over near two acres [0.81 ha] of ground, has Comfortable barracks, and large stone houses inside. It is rendered inaccessible by land, except a narrow pass up near the margin of the river, by reason of an impenetrable swamp in the rear and extending to the river above. The fort was very well provided with ordnance:It included 4 twenty-four-pound cannons, 4 six-pound cannons, beside a field piece and a howitzer. In addition there were found 2,500 stands of muskets with accoutrements, 500 carbines and 500 swords ... 300 quarter-casks of rifle powder and 162 barrels of cannon powder, besides other stores and clothing.

The area enclosed by the fort was ; on the eastern corners (those most vulnerable to attack) were bastions with walls high and thick.

The magazine area of the fort was located about 500 feet from the river bank, and consisted of an octagonal blockhouse holding the principal magazine. This was surrounded by an extensive star-shaped enclosure covering about 16 acres with bastions on the eastern corners. The ravelin along the river with cannon was 15 feet high and 18 feet thick.

Gaines estimated that 900 Native American warriors and 450 armed blacks inhabited the fort.

A miniature replica of the later Fort Gadsden was constructed in the 1970s; a picture is in the State Archives of Florida.

==Negro Fort (1815–16)==
When the British withdrew, they deliberately left all their weapons, hoping that the locals would use them to defend themselves from U.S. attempts to re-enslave them, just as African and Native Americans had assisted the British during the American War of Independence. Most of the Native Americans (Seminoles and Red Stick Creeks) warriors who remained behind abandoned the fort soon afterwards.

Some[who?] remained, along with many of the trained soldiers of the disbanded Corps of Colonial Marines, which was a British Army regiment consisting of freed slaves. 

Over the next year the fort became a growing colony of escaped slaves from Georgia and the Mississippi Territory, and became known as the Negro Fort. It was the center of the largest community of free negroes in North America before the U.S. Civil War.

The fort, located as it was near the border, was seen by the U.S. as &quot;a beacon of light to restless and rebellious slaves,&quot; &quot;a center of hostility and above all a threat to the security of their slaves,&quot; &quot;a direct threat to the slave-holding interests rapidly flocking to the newly opened lands in what is today Mississippi and Alabama.&quot; On April 8, 1816, General Jackson ordered General Gaines to &quot;take care of the situation&quot;, because the Fort &quot;ought to be blown up&quot;; it was only fomenting &quot;rapine and plunder&quot;, and he should &quot;return the stolen Negros and plunder to their rightful owners&quot;.

Having done so, on April 23 he then complained to the West Florida military governor Mauricio de Zúñiga, asking whether that fort has been built by the government of Spain — and whether the negroes, who garrison it, are considered subjects of his Catholic Majesty — and if not by the authority of Spain — by whom, under whose orders, has it been established[?]

He informed Zúñiga that:Secret practices to inveigle Negroes from the frontier citizens of Georgia as well as from the Cherokee and Creek nations of Indians are still continued by this Banditti [sic; he means the garrison] and the Hostile Creeks. This is a state of things which cannot fail to produce much injury to the neighboring settlements and incite Irritations which may ultimately endanger the peace of the nation and interrupt that good understanding that so happily exists between our governments.

He insisted on the &quot;return to our citizens and the friendly Indians inhabiting our Territory those Negroes now in the said fort and which have been stolen and enticed from them.&quot; This conduct &quot;will not be tolerated by our government and if not put down by the Spanish Authority will compel us in self Defence to destroy them.&quot;

After Zúñiga&#x27;s reply of May 26, 1816, informing Jackson that he could not act &quot;unless I receive the 
Orders of my Captain General [in Cuba] and the necessary Supplies&quot;, Jackson proceeded with his plans to destroy the Fort.

The first step was the construction of Fort Scott, located at a key military point upriver, the west bank of the Flint River where it empties into the Apalachicola, in the southwestern corner of Georgia. Boats supplying Fort Scott had to go up the Apalachicola River and past the Negro Fort. The supply boats were escorted by two gunboats. &quot;Gaines obviously wanted to provoke an attack to justify the stronghold&#x27;s destruction.&quot; When shots were fired from the Fort at passing boats, this was all the excuse for action Gaines needed. On July 27, 1816, a &quot;hot shot&quot; (a cannonball heated to a red glow in the gunboat&#x27;s galley) from the American forces entered the opening to the fort&#x27;s powder magazine, igniting an explosion that was heard more than 100 miles (160 km) away in Pensacola, and destroyed the fort, killing all but 30 of 300 occupants. It has been called &quot;the single deadliest cannon shot in American history.&quot; It was also &quot;the largest battle in history between fugitive slaves and U.S. forces seeking to reenslave them.&quot;

Spain protested the violation of its soil, but according to historian John K. Mahon, it &quot;lacked the power to do more.&quot;

A former commemorative plaque at the scene reads as follows:

It is hard to imagine the horrible scene that greeted the first Americans to stand here on the morning of July 27, 1816. The remains of 230 persons killed in the magazine explosion lay scattered about. They also found an arsenal of ten cannons, 2,500 muskets and over 150 barrels of black powder. Some original timbers from the octagonal magazine were uncovered here by excavations.

The trading post of John Forbes and Company, storekeeper Edward Doyle, was reestablished following the destruction of the fort.

==Fort Gadsden (1818–21)==
To secure the militarily significant Prospect Bluff, protect commerce on the river, prevent the recreation of a fugitive slave community—new fugitives were arriving—, and as a base for his further invasion of Florida, in 1818 General Jackson directed Lieutenant James Gadsden, of the Army Corps of Engineers, to rebuild the fort, which he did within the earthworks that had protected Negro Fort, as it was much smaller. The fort needed a new name; Jackson named it Fort Gadsden. However, an aide to General Andrew Jackson reported to his superior in August 1818 that Fort Gadsden was &quot;a temporary work, hastily erected, and of perishable materials, without constant repair, it could not last more than four or five years.&quot; It was abandoned in 1821, the year Florida became a U.S. territory and there was no longer a national border to defend.

Fort Gadsden had no direct involvement in any military endeavor, either in 1818–1821 or during the Civil War.

===Colinton===
In 1820, Colin Mitchell would purchase the Forbes Lands, including Fort Gadsden. The following year he made plans to construct a city at the site, Colinton. The planned city would have had 4 squares and wharves for incoming steamboats. However, Mitchell&#x27;s claim to the land would be found invalid, and Colinton was never built.

==&quot;Milly Francis&quot;==
A marker at the site recalls the case of Milly Francis, a Creek girl who persuaded her father, Hillis Hadjo (Francis the Prophet), not to execute an American soldier who had inadvertently come into their territory. Her father was captured and hung at Fort St. Marks in 1818. She witnessed his hanging.

==&quot;Irvington&quot; remains==
A steamboat, the &quot;Irvington&quot;, burned and sank in 1838 four miles north of the Site. The rusting boilers and some of the works thought to be from this ship were dredged from the river (when the river was being dredged for navigation) and can be seen at the Site.

==Civil War (1862–1863)==
During the American Civil War, Confederate troops occupied the fort, using it to protect communications from plantations in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama with the port of Apalachicola. In July 1863, an outbreak of malaria forced its abandonment.

==Fort Gadsden given disproportionate emphasis at historic site==
&quot;The settlement of former slaves has been marginalized in and has largely receded from both the scholarly and popular imagination for much of the last [20th] century.&quot;

Among the many important moments in Prospect Bluff&#x27;s history is the Negro Fort period (1815–1816) and this is the period of significance cited in the National Register Nomination. The site was initially named for Fort Gadsden. The Fort Gadsden Historic Site was created in 1961, when racial divisions may have led to downplaying the battle, although other causes such as population displacement may have contributed as well.

The 2016 renaming of the site as Prospect Bluff Historic Sites acknowledged that more than Fort Gadsden existed there and uses a name that the residents of that area in the 19th century would have known it by.

==Bicentennial activities==
*On May 16–20, 2016, the National Park Service held a workshop with 50 participants on using technological tools to non-destructively investigate below a site&#x27;s surface. 
*On October 22, 2016, the United States Forest Service commemorated 200 years since the tragic events of July 1816. There was a Seminole Color Guard, &quot;descendants of Prospect Bluff Maroon community&quot;, with keynote speaker Chairman James E. Billie of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. A video of the ceremony is available.
*The Florida Humanities Council funded a program that created virtual landscapes for 1816 Prospect Bluff as well as the Maroon community of Angola on the Manatee River.

<text>Murry Gage Wilson (July 2, 1917 – June 4, 1973) was an American songwriter, talent manager, record producer, and music publisher, best known as the father of the Beach Boys&#x27; Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson. After the band&#x27;s formation in 1961, Murry became their first manager, and in 1962, he founded their publishing company, Sea of Tunes, with Brian. Later in his life, Wilson was accused of physically and verbally abusing his children, charges which he denied.

Raised in Los Angeles, Wilson grew up in a hostile family environment due to his own father&#x27;s violent nature. After his children were born, he founded a machining business, A.B.L.E. (Always Better Lasting Equipment) but maintained an active interest in music, which he passed along to his sons. Wilson authored or co-authored at least 50 compositions in his lifetime, albeit with little commercial success. His most popular songs were &quot;Two-Step, Side-Step&quot;, recorded by Johnnie Lee Wills and Bonnie Lou in the 1950s, and &quot;Break Away&quot;, released as a Beach Boys single in 1969. Wilson was also credited as producer for some of the band&#x27;s early records, including the 1962 singles &quot;409&quot; and &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;.

The Beach Boys dismissed Wilson as their manager in early 1964 due to his overbearing and disruptive presence at the group&#x27;s concerts and recording sessions. Following this, he produced the sound-alike group the Sunrays, and recorded an easy listening album, &quot;The Many Moods of Murry Wilson&quot; (1967). Wilson controlled the Beach Boys&#x27; publishing until 1969, when he sold Sea of Tunes to Irving Almo Music in exchange for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). In 1973, he died, aged 55, of a heart attack. His management of the group&#x27;s publishing became the subject of numerous lawsuits decades later.

==Background==
Murry Gage Wilson was born on July 2, 1917, in Hutchinson, Kansas, as the third child and second son of Edith Sophia (née Sthole) and William Coral &quot;Buddy&quot; Wilson, a plumber. His father was of English, Irish, and Scottish descent, while his mother was of Swedish heritage. The middle name Gage was taken from the doctor who delivered him as a baby. One of Murry&#x27;s eight siblings died in infancy. In 1921, the family moved west to Los Angeles, and were initially so impoverished that they camped for two months in a tent on the beach when they arrived. In 1929, the family settled at a home on 605 West 99th Street near Inglewood, and one year later, rented a nearby farmhouse at 9722 South Figueroa.

Buddy, who struggled with alcoholism, was often physically and verbally abusive to his family. In one incident, after Buddy&#x27;s glasses were broken by Murry&#x27;s younger brother Charlie, Buddy beat the boy so savagely that the rest of the family temporarily forced him out of the home. According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Murry increasingly &quot;found himself thrust into the role of his mother&#x27;s protector, raising his own fists against the father he loved but who seemed unable to love him or anyone else in the family.&quot;

Murry was interested in music from a young age and aspired to be a pop songwriter since he was a teenager. Of his musicianship, Carlin states that Murry was self-taught on guitar and received piano lessons from his sister, but biographer Timothy White writes that Murry could not play an instrument. In 1931, Wilson enrolled at Washington High School. There, he met Audree Neva Korthof, who, in addition to playing piano, sang at school functions and community events with her classmates. They graduated in June 1935 and were married on March 26, 1938.

Following graduation, Murry worked as a clerk at Southern California Gas Company, until the birth of their first child, Brian, in 1942. After Brian&#x27;s birth Murry took a job as a junior administrator at the Los Angeles Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber factory, located at 6701 South Central Avenue, where he lost his left eye in an industrial accident. Wilson reflected, &quot;When I was twenty-five I thought the world owed me a living. When I lost my eye, I tried harder, drove harder, and did the work of two men and got more raises.&quot; He had two more children with Audree, Dennis (born 1944) and Carl (born 1946). After Dennis&#x27;s birth, the family purchased a two-bedroom house at West 119th Street in Hawthorne, California.

After his injury, Wilson returned to Goodyear, but soon left the factory for a job at Garrett AiResearch, where he worked from 1945 to 1950. He then did a four-year stint at Admiral Machinery Company, a heavy machinery leasing business, where he was employed by his younger brother Douglas. In March 1955, Murry obtained a loan of $20,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to finance the start of his own machining business, A.B.L.E. Machinery Company (Always Better Lasting Equipment).

==Treatment of his children==
Wilson maintained an active interest in music, which he passed along to his sons, encouraging them to learn to sing and play instruments. Murry reflected, &quot;I&#x27;ve been writing songs for as long as I can remember. My family has always had a great appreciation for the value of music. Many an evening my wife and I used to gather our sons and sing around our organ. Those were pretty lean days for us. We couldn&#x27;t afford to go to a show, so we entertained ourselves with music.&quot; According to White, Murry was often forceful in this field.

The Wilson brothers did not publicly discuss their problematic relationship with their father until they were adults. Many stories of physical and verbal abuse surfaced, including a supposed incident where Murry hit Brian in the head with a 2×4, resulting in the permanent loss of hearing in his right ear, and another occasion in which he disciplined Brian by forcing him to defecate on a plate. Murry denied such reports when approached by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1971. According to biographer David Leaf, Murry later &quot;telephoned Brian and angrily demanded that he retract the stories. Reportedly, Brian laughingly told his dad, &#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you what. Let&#x27;s tell them that I shit in your ear, and you hit me in the head with a plate.&quot;

Out of the three Wilson brothers, Dennis was the most likely to get spanked by their father. Audree recalled, &quot;Dennis had it the hardest; he got some very hard spankings. [Murry] was tough; I used to think he was too tough.&quot; Dennis later described his father as &quot;a tyrant ... I don&#x27;t know kids who got it like we did.&quot; Carl declined to comment on the accusations against his father. Brian&#x27;s 2016 memoir states, &quot;Lots of things have been written about my dad and the way he treated me and my brothers. Lots of them are true. Some of them are dirty lies. But even the things that are true aren&#x27;t always what they seem.&quot; Leaf wrote, &quot;Some people loved Murry, others insist he was a &#x27;sick man,&#x27; but few will deny that he physically and verbally abused his children. ... In private, many people confirm that the Wilson brothers had it very hard.&quot;

Although he was a strict parent, Murry frequently surprised his children with gifts, such as a BB gun and a go-kart for Dennis. For Dennis&#x27;s tenth birthday, Murry hosted a children&#x27;s party that converted the family home into a jungle gym for Dennis and his friends to play in. One of Dennis&#x27;s classmates, Don Allen, remembered Murry as &quot;being outgoing, friendly, jovial, enthusiastic, and quite in the spirit of being a ten-year-old boy.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s nephew Mike Love said that his uncle often applied a &quot;Vulcan nerve pinch&quot; to boys in the neighborhood. &quot;He never truly hurt anyone, but he inspired plenty of fear.&quot;

==Early songwriting career and the Beach Boys==

By 1950, Murry had written several songs. In 1952, he befriended songwriters Hite and Dorinda Morgan, a married couple who jointly operated Guild Music Company, their music publishing firm. Late in the year, Hite offered to publish two of Wilson&#x27;s songs, the dance number &quot;Two Step, Side Step&quot; and the ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Hide My Tears&quot;, and have them recorded with help from Hite&#x27;s connections in the Los Angeles music industry. In exchange for signing with the Morgans, Murry received $50 as an advance on future royalties the songs may yield.

In early 1953, the couple arranged to have &quot;Two Side, Side Step&quot; recorded by Palace Records act the Bachelors. To promote the forthcoming record, member Jimmie Haskell arranged to have the song performed by the Lawrence Welk Orchestra on Welk&#x27;s nationally-broadcast &quot;On the Air from the Aragon&quot; radio show in May 1953. Also arranged by Hite, renditions of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Painting with Teardrops (of Blue)&quot; and &quot;Two Step, Side Step&quot; were recorded by country singer Johnny Hall and released as a single on the Recorded in Hollywood label. In 1954, &quot;I&#x27;ll Hide My Tears&quot; was recorded by the Jets (a reconfiguration of the Hollywood Flames), and &quot;Two Step, Side Step&quot; was recorded by early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer Bonnie Lou. &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewed Lou&#x27;s rendition as a &quot;cute bouncy tune&quot; that would likely become a popular jukebox pick.

After the Beach Boys&#x27; formation, Murry became the group&#x27;s business manager, co-producer, and publisher in the early part of their career. Murry was a tough negotiator on the band&#x27;s behalf, organizing a contract signing with Capitol Records. Around June 1962, Murry and Brian established the music publishing company Sea of Tunes to safeguard Brian&#x27;s compositions. The Beach Boys&#x27; first few records credited Capitol A&amp;R director Nick Venet as producer. After April 1963, Capitol allowed Brian to produce their records himself, following Murry&#x27;s insistence. Murry also introduced Brian to Roger Christian, who became Brian&#x27;s writing partner for the band&#x27;s car songs.

==Dismissal as the Beach Boys&#x27; manager==
Murry accompanied the group on their first Australasian tour in January 1964, and requested that the band not fraternize with women, use profanity, or drink alcoholic beverages. During his early years, Wilson charged the group $100 for violating these requests, but for this tour, he increased the fine to $1,000, which he would subtract from the touring proceeds. At the time, Wilson&#x27;s influence on the Beach Boys ignited tensions within the group.

Upon the tour&#x27;s completion, the band members held a vote in which they unanimously agreed to relieve Murry from his managerial duties. According to Love, &quot;Brian and I drove to his parents&#x27; house, and Brian told him straight out: &#x27;Look, we can&#x27;t deal with you anymore. We&#x27;ve got to get a new manager.&#x27;&quot; In Carl&#x27;s recollection, &quot;I remember having a conversation with my dad in his bedroom at home. I said, &#x27;They really don&#x27;t want you to manage the group anymore.&#x27; When I think about it, that must have really crushed him. After all, he gave up his home and business for us. He was kind of crackers over us.&quot; Audree said that the dismissal &quot;destroyed&quot; her husband and that he refused to leave his bed for weeks.

Another report suggests that Wilson was fired in early April 1964, following incidents involving the recording sessions of the singles &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; and &quot;I Get Around&quot;. According to Mike Love, by then, Murry had already stopped managing the band for a &quot;couple months&quot;, although he did disrupt a studio session in April. &quot;Brian had a hard time standing up to his father, but this time he did. ... Then he shoved his dad, who went sprawling backward. That was the only time I ever saw Brian defy him physically, and Murry, defeated, left the studio.&quot; In 1966, Brian reflected, &quot;We love the family thing – y&#x27;know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group – but the extra generation can become a hang-up.&quot;

==Aftermath and the Sunrays==
Even after Murry&#x27;s formal business relationship with the Beach Boys ended, he remained in close contact with the group, letting Brian know his thoughts about the band&#x27;s decisions. Brian also periodically sought advice from his father. In 1964, Murry sold off his machinery business and separated from Audree. According to music historian Mark Dillon, it has been alleged that Wilson had one or more extramarital affairs, &quot;but whether this was in the aftermath of his separation from Audree or was ultimately the cause is not known.&quot; Biographer Peter Ames Carlin suggested that Brian&#x27;s song &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot; (1965) was inspired by Murry&#x27;s affairs.

In June 1964, Murry produced three tracks for David Marks&#x27; group the Marksmen: &quot;Car Party&quot;, &quot;Casanova&quot;, and &quot;Leaves&quot;. During the mid-1960s, Murry produced and managed the Sunrays, a group comprising five students who attended Hollywood Professional High School led by Rick Henn, a friend of Carl Wilson. The Sunrays earned some media attention and a bit of airplay for their initial singles, but never broke into the national Top 40. Their two best-known singles, &quot;I Live for the Sun&quot; and &quot;Andrea&quot;, were regional hits in California. Session drummer Hal Blaine remembered of the Sunrays sessions, &quot;You could smell the liquor something terrible when he [Wilson] came near you. Everybody got a two-dollar bill as a tip before we started, and then he&#x27;d get down on one knee and say a prayer. It was very weird.&quot;

In February 1965, Wilson visited a Beach Boys recording session for &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and, to the group&#x27;s annoyance, attempted to resume his role as the band&#x27;s producer. A tape of the session later circulated widely among bootleggers. On May 8, Murry drafted an eight-page letter to Brian in which he correlated the Beach Boys&#x27; rise to fame with the disintegration of his family. He wrote that he felt he was &quot;almost [in] a living hell&quot; and &quot;wanted to give up completely on two separate occasions.&quot; Dillon wrote that the letter &quot;provides a wealth of insight into his conflicted personality, and it made headlines in 2009 after being posted online.&quot;

For their next album, &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; (released July 1965), Brian wrote a novelty song inspired by his father: &quot;I&#x27;m Bugged at My Ol&#x27; Man&quot;. Murry later commented on the song, &quot;He meant it as a put-on, but he meant it.&quot; In July, he sent a letter to Brian requesting that he be officially granted sole ownership of Sea of Tunes, per a verbal agreement they had reached in 1962. According to historian Keith Badman, &quot;Brian allowed Murry to take total control to stop his father&#x27;s continual hassling on the matter.&quot;

In 1966, the Beach Boys released the album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. On the advice of his father, Brian sped up the track &quot;Caroline, No&quot; to make the vocal sound younger. Murry later told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he enjoyed the album and praised it as a &quot;masterpiece of accomplishment for Brian&quot;, noting that it had become a ubiquitous influence on the music heard in product commercials. Dennis echoed that his father &quot;used to go to pieces when he heard stuff like &#x27;Caroline, No.&#x27;&quot; Venet, who was not as enthusiastic with the album, told biographer Steven Gaines that he believed the record was Brian&#x27;s attempt to &quot;torment his father with songs his father couldn&#x27;t relate to, and melody structures his father couldn&#x27;t understand.&quot; Tony Asher, the album&#x27;s lyricist, remembered negotiating his cut of the royalties with Murry, describing his 25% share as &quot;a &quot;screw&quot;&quot;.

Although their marriage ended in divorce in 1966, Murry and Audree remained closely involved with each other until his death. However, Audree lived in a separate home that was purchased for her by Murry. After Carl and Brian revealed that they were marijuana smokers to their parents, Murry forbade Audree from allowing her sons to visit her home until Christmas 1967.

==&quot;The Many Moods of Murry Wilson&quot; and Sea of Tunes sale==
In October 1967, Capitol released Murry&#x27;s &quot;The Many Moods of Murry Wilson&quot;, an easy listening LP that included a rendition of &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot;. While promoting the album in Britain, he told &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; that &quot;after &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; Brian lost a lot of confidence. He didn&#x27;t think he could ever write anything as good as that again ... With [my] LP I&#x27;m going to nudge my boys&#x27; competitive spirit.&quot; &quot; Leaves&quot; was released in the United States as the album&#x27;s (and Wilson&#x27;s) only single in December 1967 with British demonstration records of &quot;The Plumber&#x27;s Tune&quot; being produced by EMI for Capitol at the same time.

In 1968, Wilson appeared on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Friends&quot; album, singing the brief bass vocal harmony in the chorus of &quot;Be Here in the Mornin″&quot;. In early 1969, he co-wrote the Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Break Away&quot; with Brian, and was credited under the pseudonym &quot;Reggie Dunbar&quot; on the record, which was released without much commercial success. In October, he returned to the studio to work on various productions, including a song titled &quot;Gonna Be Alright&quot;.

In late 1969, Wilson sold Sea of Tunes, over the band&#x27;s objections, for the undervalued amount of $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Brian later suggested that his signature was forged by his father on several related business documents, making the sale illegal.

==Illness and death==
In April 1970, Wilson assembled a tape comprising songs that he had recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders called &quot;So Much in Love&quot; and &quot;Love to Be Your Lover&quot;. The tape begins with a spoken interlude in which Wilson suggests the Beach Boys should record these songs, as he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have long to live&quot;. In August 1971, Wilson cut a song he wrote with Brian called &quot;Won&#x27;t You Tell Me&quot;. The Sunrays released their version of the song on the 1996 compilation &quot;For Collectors Only: Vintage Rays&quot;. Other versions of the song – one an organ demo by Brian, and another featuring Brian and Carl on lead vocals – remained unreleased until the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows&quot;. On September 11, &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; reported that when Dennis had permanently left the Beach Boys was in the process of &quot;setting up a production and publication company with his father&quot;.

In 1972, Murry became ill with diverticulitis that contributed to his worsening heart disease. Also that year, he worked on various songs, including one called &quot;Take Back the Time&quot;. In October, he recorded a commercial jingle that he intended to offer to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain. In the spring of 1973, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized for one or two weeks. During his final years, Murry had regularly socialized with Dennis. Audree recalled, &quot;They were buddies. It&#x27;s the most amazing thing ... Dennis called his father on Mother&#x27;s Day and Murry told him, &#x27;I&#x27;m just going to live about a month.&#x27; Dennis didn&#x27;t tell me this, thank God! I didn&#x27;t need to know that, but he could tell Dennis that.&quot;

On June 4, 1973, Murry died at his home in Whittier, California, after having a heart attack at the age of 55. His official cause of death was attributed to &quot;acute myocardial infarcation&quot; as a result of &quot;coronary atherosclerosis&quot;. Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral, but Dennis visited Murry&#x27;s body in the morgue. Brian later said, &quot;I didn’t go to his funeral. I went to New York with Diane, my sister-in-law. I wasn’t staying away out of anger or anything. It was just too many things all at once, and I was not in the mood to go to my dad’s funeral.&quot; Carl said, &quot;I really loved my dad a lot. It just about killed Brian when our dad died.&quot;

Murry was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Shortly after Murry&#x27;s death, Brian told an interviewer that he was planning to record Murry&#x27;s song &quot;Lazaloo&quot;. It was also reported that Brian wrote a song, &quot;Just an Imitation&quot;, as a tribute to his father. As of 2014, a tape of the song had yet to surface. Wilson later described it as &quot;a beautiful ballad and kind of a tribute to my dad.&quot; On December 1, 1997, Audree died of kidney failure and cardiovascular issues at the age of 80.

==Legacy==
===Recognition===
In a 2004 interview, Brian recalled of his father, &quot;He was the one who got us going. He didn&#x27;t make us better artists or musicians, but he gave us ambition. I&#x27;m pleased he pushed us, because it was such a relief to know there was someone as strong as my dad to keep things going. He used to spank us, and it hurt too, but I loved him because he was a great musician.&quot; Furthermore, in 2005, he said that although people often mislabel Murry as an untalented songwriter, &quot;[he] had talent, he sure did. He was a talented man. He had some music in him ... My favorite song of his was one called &#x27;His Little Darling and You&#x27;. It was a ballad.&quot; In 2008, Brian included his own reworked version of the song, retitled &quot;Just Like Me And You&quot;, as a bonus track on his album &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;.

Engineer Chuck Britz, studio owner Stan Ross, record executive Russ Regan, and band promoter Fred Vail all spoke positively of Murry and credited him with much of the band&#x27;s initial success. Members of the Sunrays described Murry as &quot;the [nicest] man ever&quot; and denied seeing any abuse from him toward the Beach Boys. Britz said: &quot;I was one of the few people who liked Murry. I always did. I admired him for the way he got the kids mad at him; that made them also conscious of what they were trying to achieve. I realize that maybe he did it the wrong way, but at the same time, he did make them work as a team which was the way it should be.&quot; Vail likened their father to &quot;an Army drill sergeant&quot; and said that he was &quot;key&quot; to the band&#x27;s success, before adding,

James Murphy, author of &quot;Becoming the Beach Boys&quot;, commented that &quot;material possessions do not make a childhood happy, but Murry did his best [on a modest salary] to provide his boys with things they enjoyed. And no one fought harder for the fledgling Beach Boys than Murry.&quot; Conversely, in his 2016 memoir, Mike Love wrote that Murry was &quot;a driving force in the Beach Boys’ early success, but his greed and vindictiveness deny him any tribute. The most forgiving thing I can say about him is that he was simply an inheritor of his own father’s cruelty.&quot; He added, &quot;what is often missed in the Wilson family history is that my aunt Audree was the true musical talent in that marriage.&quot; Brian himself stated in a 2005 interview that Murry &quot;was a bad musician. I learned nothing from him.&quot;

===Posthumous releases and tributes===
The Sunrays&#x27; 1996 retrospective compilation album &quot;For Collectors Only&quot; marked the first time Wilson&#x27;s music had been officially released since his death over 20 years earlier, including a 1972 demo of &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Song&quot; which was envisioned as a commercial jingle for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 2019, an extended play of songs recorded by Wilson and unknown Midwestern vocal group Snow (supposedly introduced to Wilson by Rick Henn) in 1969 including &quot;Break Away&quot; was released via download by Omnivore Recordings. In 2020, musician George Faulkner released a tribute album, &quot;George Faulkner Sings Murry Wilson&quot;, containing 11 Wilson songs. It was the first vinyl LP collection of vocal songs composed by Wilson ever released. This included &quot;For You and Me&quot;, a 1953 composition that was discovered in demo form on a set of acetate discs found at a Los Angeles-area thrift store. David Marks contributed liner notes to the album.

===Fictional portrayals===
Wilson was portrayed in two television movies: in 1990&#x27;s &quot;Summer Dreams: The Story of the Beach Boys&quot;, by Arlen Dean Snyder, and in 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Beach Boys: An American Family&quot;, by Kevin Dunn. The latter program inspired illustrator Peter Bagge and comedian Dana Gould to create a 2000 web cartoon based on Wilson, titled &quot;Rock and Roll Dad&quot;, with Wilson voiced by Paul F. Tompkins. In the 2014 biopic &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot;, Wilson is portrayed by Bill Camp.

<doc id="983248" wikidata="Q1018081" url="?curid=983248" title="Butterfinger">
<text>Butterfinger is a candy bar manufactured by the Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero. It is manufactured internationally by Nestlé. It consists of a layered crisp peanut butter core covered in a &quot;chocolatey&quot; coating (it is not eligible to be referred to as chocolate, as it contains no cocoa butter). It was invented by Otto Schnering of the Curtiss Candy Company in 1923. A popularity contest chose the name.

In its early years, the Butterfinger was promoted by Shirley Temple in the 1934 film &quot;Baby Take a Bow&quot;. It was advertised by characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (most notably Bart Simpson) from 1988 to 2001.

==History==
Butterfinger was invented by Otto Schnering in 1923. Schnering had founded the Curtiss Candy Company near Chicago, Illinois, in 1922. The company held a public contest to choose the name of this candy. In an early marketing campaign, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States as a publicity stunt that helped increase its popularity.

The candy bar was also promoted in &quot;Baby Take a Bow&quot;, a 1934 film featuring Shirley Temple.

In 1964, Standard Brands, Inc. purchased the Curtiss Candy Company. It then merged with Nabisco in 1981. RJR Nabisco was formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

In December 1988, RJR Nabisco was purchased by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in what was, at the time, the largest leveraged buyout in history. In February 1990, Nestlé, a Swiss multinational food and beverage company, bought Baby Ruth and Butterfinger from RJR Nabisco.

Butterfinger was withdrawn from the market in Germany in 1999, because of consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be identified as containing genetically modified ingredients (GMOs) from corn. Butterfinger sales ended after a successful campaign by Greenpeace pushed Nestlé to remove the product from German supermarkets.

With sales in 2010 of $598 million, Butterfinger had become increasingly popular and was typically ranked as the eleventh most popular candy bar sold in the $17.68 billion United States chocolate confectionery market between 2007 and 2010.

In January 2018, Nestlé announced plans to sell over twenty of its US confectionery brands (including Butterfinger) to Italian chocolatier Ferrero SpA, for $2.8 billion. The deal was finalized in March 2018, and the newly acquired brands were folded into the operations of the Ferrero Candy Company.

==Recipe change==
Ferrero reformulated the Butterfinger in January 2019, with labels displaying &quot;Improved Recipe&quot;. &quot;Better&quot; Butterfinger, as it is identified in advertising, uses runner peanuts in the bar&#x27;s core that are roasted at the manufacturing plant. The new bar also uses a higher percentage of cocoa and milk in the &quot;chocolatey&quot; coating and cuts ingredients such as the preservative TBHQ and hydrogenated oils.

The packaging itself has also been upgraded to avoid spoilage.

Some social media users have criticized the new recipe.

==Advertising==
Beginning in 1988, Butterfinger was advertised with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, still a series of shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show at the time. The first commercial was the advertisement &quot;The Butterfinger Group&quot;, which featured the debut of the character Milhouse Van Houten. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was immediately popular and boosted the candy&#x27;s popularity. In 1992, the Simpsons began to appear in Butterfinger BB&#x27;s commercials. The &quot;Simpsons&quot;-Butterfinger marketing was phased out by 2001 but brought back in 2010.

Butterfinger campaigns include counting down the end of the world or BARmageddon, with evidence such as the first-ever, QR shaped crop circle in Kansas, a Butterfinger comedy-horror movie called “Butterfinger the 13th,” the first interactive digital graphic novel by a candy brand starring the Butterfinger Defense League, and several attention-grabbing April Fool&#x27;s Day pranks, including the renaming of the candy bar to “The Finger.”

On April 1, 2008, Nestlé launched an April Fool&#x27;s Day prank in which they claimed that they had changed the name of the candy bar to &quot;The Finger&quot;, citing consumer research that indicated that the original brand was &quot;clumsy&quot; and &quot;awkward&quot;. The prank included a fake website promoting the change that featured a video press release. When the joke was revealed, the website redirected visitors to the fictitious &quot;Butterfinger Comedy Network&quot;.

In 2009, a new advertisement for Butterfinger was produced that appeared to be a homage to the earlier &quot;The Simpsons&quot; commercials. In February 2010, Butterfinger revived its &quot;Nobody better lay a finger...&quot; slogan as &quot;Nobody&#x27;s gonna lay a finger on my Butterfinger.&quot;

In April 2013, an official announcement via the Twitter account of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; stated that the &quot;Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger&quot; advertising campaign featuring Bart Simpson would be returning. In the opening sequence of &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVIII&quot; (2017), the family appeared as candy in a bowl. Bart, a &quot;Barterfinger&quot; bar, tells his mother, Marge, a &quot;Marge Bar&quot;, he is scared, and she comforts him by stating he was always the last to be taken.

In May 2024, The Simpsons returned for Butterfinger&#x27;s 100th anniversary. Bart and Homer were featured on single and two pack wrappers while the whole family was on Fun Size packaging.

==Sponsorships==

Butterfinger sponsored pro Freestyle Motocross rider Nate Adams as well as pro BMX rider Ryan Nyquist in 2003. Butterfinger also sponsored Blushi and other Twitch streamers in 2023.

==Variations==
*Bites: In 2009, Butterfinger introduced Mini Bites, a product with small, bite-sized pieces of Butterfinger.
*Snackerz: Butterfinger Snackerz was another bite-sized, smooth-centered version of the candy bar.
*BB&#x27;s: Starting in 1992, another form of Butterfinger bars was available named &quot;BB&#x27;s&quot;. Similar to Whoppers and Maltesers, they were roughly the size of marbles and sold in bags. They also were advertised by the Simpsons. Discontinued 2006, relaunched 2009 as Butterfinger Bites. 
*Buzz: During the height of the energy drink craze in 2009, a two piece ‘king size’ version of the candy bar containing 80 milligrams of caffeine was released with limited distribution. The wrapper bears this warning: &quot;Contains 80 mg per package (40 mg per piece), as much as in the leading energy drink. Not recommended for pregnant women, children or persons sensitive to caffeine.&quot; They were quickly discontinued.
*Ice Cream Bar: A product with an ice cream filling, the Butterfinger Ice Cream Bar, was introduced in 1991 and continues to be sold in individual bags to this day. Another product similar to that of Butterfinger Ice Cream Bars, but shaped in a nugget form, also was developed in 1992 and is now discontinued.
*Crisp: Nestlé also produced Butterfinger Crisp bars, which are a form of chocolate covered wafer cookie, with a Butterfinger flavored cream. This is part of a line of Nestlé products under a &quot;crisp&quot; name, including Nestlé Crunch Crisp and Baby Ruth Crisp.
*Cocoa Mix: Nestlé released a hot cocoa mix with the flavor of the Butterfinger bar. The packaging advertises the cocoa as having a chocolate and peanut butter taste.
*Cups: In 2014, a product similar to Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups was introduced by Nestlé, the Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cup, which unlike Reese&#x27;s Cups, has both crunchy and creamy peanut butter and covers the mix with milk chocolate. It was the first new Butterfinger product introduced in more than five years. Nestlé spent two years developing the product. However, they were discontinued in 2018 when the bars were sold to Ferrero SpA.
*Naked: The Naked Butterfinger is a version of the standard size candy bar that will only have a coating of chocolate on the bottom to hold it together.
*Dark: Made with Dark Chocolate. They were discontinued in 2018 when the bars were sold to Ferrero SpA.
*Bits: Crumbled Butterfinger bars, produced for consumers to bake their own Butterfinger dessert recipes.

===Use by other manufacturers===
Butterfingers are used in a part of Edy&#x27;s Fun Flavors line (branded as Dreyer&#x27;s west of the Rocky Mountains and outside the United States). The product is vanilla ice cream with a peanut butter swirl and bits of the Butterfinger candy bar in it.

Grocery store Kroger has a flavor in their &quot;Jammed&quot; line named Peanut Butter Candy Crunch that is a peanut-flavored frozen dairy dessert with Butterfinger chunks and a peanut butter swirl whose flavor resembles that of the Butterfinger candy bar.

<text>Dean Cavanagh is a screenwriter, novelist and Playwright born in Bradford, West Yorkshire. In 1990, at the height of the acid house scene, he founded the club culture magazine &quot;Herb Garden&quot; and a band with Enzo Annecchini. His electronic music outfit, Glamorous Hooligan, was picked up by Warner Bros. offshoot Arthrob, and in 1996, they released an album, &quot;Naked City Soundtrax&quot;. Glamorous Hooligan&#x27;s first album &quot;Wasted Youth Club Classics&quot; was released by indie label Mass of Black in 1994. Cavanagh has stated that his proudest moment was getting Robert Anton Wilson to guest on one of the tracks. As a musician, he featured on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the Suburbs&quot; TV show, in the late 1990s. As a clubland promoter, he ran underground house music, and techno, clubs in Bradford, called Tolerance, before moving on to Leeds, where he promoted the Soundclash club bringing in DJs such as Andrew Weatherall, Alex Patterson, Adrian Sherwood and J. Saul Kane.

Cavanagh has written two theatre plays with Irvine Welsh that have been performed internationally. Babylon Heights premiered in San Francisco in 2006 before a run in Dublin. Performers premiered at The Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh as part of the festival in 2017. Both plays have been published.

== Author ==
His debut The Secret Life of The Novel was published by Zani in 2017. His short story &quot;Mile High Meltdown&quot; was included in the &quot;Disco Biscuits&quot; anthology, published by Sceptre.

== Journalist ==
As a journalist he has contributed to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Positive Energy of Madness&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot;, as well as the &quot;Herb Garden&quot;, and &quot;i-D&quot;. He has also worked in copywriting, penning commercials and working alongside directors John McFarlane and Tarsem Singh before progressing to writing TV, theater plays and film.

Cavanagh wrote a late night sitcom called &quot;Honky Sausages&quot; that McFarlane directed for UK Play TV and gave a start to the actress Laila Morse, &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Cavanagh developed many projects with Terry Gilliam&#x27;s producer Ray Cooper for John Kamen&#x27;s company RadicalMedia.

Cavanagh works regularly with Irvine Welsh. Their play &quot;Babylon Heights&quot; has been performed to critical acclaim in Dublin, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New Zealand. In 2004, Cavanagh and Welsh were BAFTA nominated for their BBC Three short film &quot;Dose&quot;, starring Jonathon Lewis Owen, Kate Jarman and Julia Davis and directed by Philip John. &quot;Wedding Belles&quot; is a feature film written by Welsh and Cavanagh that was transmitted by C4 in March 2007. It stars Shirley Henderson, Michelle Gomez, Michael Fassbender, Shauna McDonald, and Kathleen McDermott. It is produced by Jemma Rodgers and directed by Philip John. Cavanagh and Welsh co-executive produced &quot;Wedding Belles&quot;. It was nominated for a best writing BAFTA.

== Scripts ==
Cavanagh has done a number of script doctoring assignments for companies such as Endemol, Warner Bros., Sony, StudioCanal and Lionsgate, Miramax both in the UK and the US. Cavanagh and Welsh have a three-season, six-part TV series called &quot;The Food Chain&quot; that was developed for HBO.

Cavanagh created the Internet series &quot;Svengali!&quot; starring Roger Evans, Sally Phillips, Martin Freeman, Matt Berry and Boy George. iTunes distributes the series worldwide for free. The film version was released in early 2014 but Cavanagh walked away from the project.

Cavanagh has completed writing and directing his first movie, &quot;Kubricks&quot; with his son Josh. &quot;I&#x27;ve been following Kubrick researchers like Rob Ager and Jay Weidner for the last few years and I really wanted to dramatize a story based around Kubrick as an inspirational enigma. There is a wealth of material about the esoteric side of Kubrick on the net and Ager and Weidner are great places to start the journey from.&quot;

Cavanagh still makes music under the name Culture Is No Friend Of Mine.

On 23 July 2020 it was announced that Cavanagh and Welsh were working on an adaptation of Welsh&#x27;s novel &quot;Crime&quot; as a 6-part miniseries for streaming service BritBox.

Cavanagh and Welsh adapted Alan McGee&#x27;s 2013 autobiography for the film &quot;Creation Stories&quot; (2021).

<doc id="983262" wikidata="Q1378977" url="?curid=983262" title="Russ Hamilton (poker player)">
<text>Russ Hamilton (born 1948 or 1949) is an American poker player. He was the 1994 World Series of Poker main event champion, defeating Hugh Vincent in heads-up play to win $1 million in first-prize money as well as his body weight in silver. Following his World Series win, Hamilton served as a consultant for Ultimate Bet, an online poker server. In 2008, the Kahnawake Gaming Commission found Hamilton largely responsible for cheating players on Ultimate Bet out of $6.1 million through software that allowed access to opponents&#x27; hole cards. In 2009, Kahnawake increased the $6.1 million estimate to $22,100,000.

Hamilton initially attended college in Michigan and pursued a degree in electrical engineering, before a conversation with a professor led him to decide that playing poker for a living would be more profitable. After playing in underground games in Detroit, he moved to Las Vegas at the age of 36. He joined a tournament blackjack team and enjoyed a successful run; however, when tournaments started barring blackjack pros, he turned back to poker. In 1994, he won the World Series of Poker main event bracelet.

He also invented Elimination Blackjack, a tournament Blackjack derivative that was used as the format for the televised Ultimate Blackjack Tour.

Hamilton&#x27;s last major cash came in the 2009 World Poker Tour PCA Main Event.

As of 2014, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,525,000. His eight cashes at the WSOP account for $1,261,940 of those winnings.

==UltimateBet fraud==
Since winning his World Series bracelet, Hamilton has served as a gaming industry expert, including as a consultant for the online poker cardroom UltimateBet, where he was involved in recruiting some prominent poker players, including Phil Hellmuth, to promote the site. He has won World Championships in several types of casino games and founded the Ultimate Blackjack Tour in 2005.

On September 29, 2008, the Kahnawake Gaming Commission stated it had found clear and convincing evidence that, between the approximate dates of May 2004 and January 2008, Russ Hamilton was the main person responsible for, and benefiting from, multiple sophisticated cheating incidents at UltimateBet. UltimateBet eventually refunded a total of $22,100,000 to the defrauded players.

In October 2008, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a report profiling Hamilton and called the fraud the biggest scandal in the history of online gambling. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; partnered with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in their investigation.

<text>Robert Burton (October 20, 1747 – May 31, 1825) was an American farmer, Revolutionary War officer, and planter in what is now Vance County, North Carolina (then Granville County, North Carolina). He was a delegate from North Carolina to the Continental Congress in 1787. Between 1783 and 1815, the North Carolina General Assembly elected him to 13 one-year terms on the Council of State, which at the time was an official advisory panel that the legislature used to check the governor&#x27;s power.

==Early life and career==
Robert Burton was born in Goochland County, Colony of Virginia on October 20, 1747. He was the son of Tabitha Minge and Hutchings Burton and may also have been the grandson of Noel Burton, barrister of Henrico County, Virginia. He moved to Granville County, North Carolina in about 1775 where he married Agatha Williams, daughter of Judge John Williams.

==Military service==
Military service record:
* Before 1780, a Lieutenant in the Virginia Continental Line 
* Colonel, Granville County Regiment (1780 1782) 
* 1780, Assistant Deputy Quartermaster General and Commissary over Hillsborough and Halifax Districts. 
* Stationed at Nutbush/Williamsboro in Granville County (currently Vance County, North Carolina)

Burton was the uncle of Governor Hutchins G. Burton.

<text>The Alaska Peninsula (also called Aleut Peninsula or Aleutian Peninsula, ; Sugpiaq: &quot;Aluuwiq&quot;, &quot;Al&#x27;uwiq&quot;) is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea.

In literature (especially Russian), the term &quot;Alaska Peninsula&quot; was used to denote the entire northwestern protrusion of the North American continent, or all of what is now the state of Alaska, exclusive of its panhandle and islands. The Lake and Peninsula borough, the Alaskan equivalent of a county, is named after the peninsula.

The Alaska/Aleutian Peninsula is also grouped into Southwest Alaska.

The other largest peninsulas in Alaska include the Kenai Peninsula and Seward Peninsula.

==Geography==

The base of the Alaska Peninsula extends outward from the end of the Alaska Range.

The Aleutian Range is a very active volcanic mountain range which runs along the entire length of the peninsula. Within it lie Wildlife Refuges, including the Katmai National Park and Preserve, the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve and the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge, the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge, and the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The most active volcano along the volcanic mountain range is Pavlof Volcano which is more than (see also: Aleutian Arc).

The southern side of the Alaska Peninsula is rugged and mountainous, created by the uplifting tectonic activity of the North Pacific Plate subsiding under a western section of the North American Plate; the northern side is generally flat and marshy, a result of millennia of erosion and general seismic stability. The northern and southern shores are likewise quite different. The northern Bristol Bay coastal side is generally turbid and muddy, experiences tidal extremes, and is relatively shallow; the Pacific side, which is also known as the &quot;ring of fire&quot;, has relatively small tidal activity and the water is deep and clear.

==Administration==
All of the peninsula is organized as a part of four adjacent boroughs; the Aleutians East Borough, Bristol Bay Borough, Kodiak Island Borough, and Lake and Peninsula Borough. The Lake and Peninsula Borough includes most of the peninsula&#x27;s territory.

==Climate==
Average annual precipitation ranges from . Coastal areas are subject to intense storms, wind, and rain. Winter temperatures average between , and in summer between . Frosts can occur any day of the year at higher elevations. The climate can be compared to that of parts of Scotland, the Aleutian Islands, Iceland, and Tierra del Fuego.

==Flora and fauna==

The Alaska Peninsula is home to some of the largest populations of native and undisturbed wildlife in the United States. Besides the famous McNeil River and Katmai Alaskan brown bear populations, large herds of caribou, moose, wolves, waterfowl, and willow ptarmigan inhabit the area. The bears of the peninsula and Bristol Bay are so numerous because they feed on the world&#x27;s largest sockeye salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;) runs, which occur here in large part because the many large lakes of the peninsula are an important element in their lifecycle. These salmon, after returning from their brief time at sea, swim into the lakes and their contributing streams to spawn. Their offspring, or &quot;fry&quot;, overwinter in the deep and food-abundant depths of these lakes until their migration to the sea in one or two years.

Exceptionally large seabird colonies exist along the coast. Additionally, there are large populations of sea mammals in the North Pacific Ocean between the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka. This includes harbor seals, ringed seals, northern fur seals, whales, porpoises, sea otters and sea lions.

The rugged southern half of the peninsula, and also the Kodiak Archipelago which lie off the south coast of the peninsula and are home to even more bears, constitute the Alaska Peninsula montane taiga ecoregion and contain a number of protected areas such as Katmai National Park. Vegetation on the peninsula consists mostly of shrub-lands, grassy meadows, or wet tundra.

==Demographics==

Besides the communities on the coast (&quot;see: Bristol Bay&quot;), the Alaska Peninsula also is home to several well-known villages: Cold Bay, King Cove, Perryville, Chignik, Chignik Lake, Chignik Lagoon, and Port Moller. Each is primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives and each, likewise, is mostly dependent on the fishing industry for sustenance.

<text>Emilio Colombo (11 April 1920 – 24 June 2013) was an Italian politician. A member of the Christian Democracy party, he served as Prime Minister of Italy from August 1970 to February 1972. In 2003, he was appointed senator for life, a seat he held until his death.

During his long political career, Colombo held many offices in several governments. He served as Minister of Agriculture from 1955 to 1958; from 1958 to 1959; Minister of Grace and Justice from 1970 to 1972; Minister of Treasury from 1963 to 1970, in 1962 and from 1974 to 1976; Minister of Budget in 1968 and from 1987 to 1988; Minister of Finance from 1988 to 1989; and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1980 to 1983 and from 1992 to 1993. A fervent Europeanist, he also served as president of the European Parliament from 1977 to 1979.

==Early life and education==
Colombo was born in Potenza, Basilicata, on 11 April 1920. He grew up, along with his six brothers, in a middle-class family; his father, Angelo Colombo, was a public administration&#x27;s official, while his mother, Rosa Tordella, was a housewife.

In 1935, he founded the first local section of Catholic Action (AC), a widespread Catholic association and one of the few non-fascist organizations, admitted by the regime of Benito Mussolini. In 1937, Colombo became the president of Potenza&#x27;s Catholic Action and member of the National Council of Catholic Action&#x27;s Youth. In the same year, he obtained the classical lyceum diploma at the high school entitled to Quintus Horatius Flaccus in Potenza.

In 1941, Colombo graduated in law at the Sapienza University of Rome, with a thesis on canon law. On 1 August 1942, he was enrolled and took part in the World War II. In September 1943, after the armistice, Colombo returned to Basilicata, starting his political commitment based on anti-fascist and Christian democratic principles. From 1944 to 1947, he was appointed general secretary of Azione Cattolica&#x27;s youth wing.

==Political career==
Colombo entered politics as a member of the Christian Democracy (DC) party in 1943. In the 1946 Italian general election, Colombo was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Italy with nearly 21,000 votes, becoming one of the youngest members of the Italian Parliament. He was elected for the constituency of Potenza–Matera, which would remain his stronghold for all his political career.
After two years, in the 1948 Italian general election, Colombo was re-elected in the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies for his constituency with more than 43,000 votes. From May 1948 to July 1951, he was appointed undersecretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests in the 5th and 6th governments of Alcide De Gasperi.

During these years, Colombo was carried on a successful mediation in Calabria in 1949 during clashes for the occupations of the lands by peasants. He also collaborated with minister Antonio Segni in the approving of the agrarian reform. The land reform, approved by the parliament in October 1950, was financed in part by the funds of the Marshall Plan launched by the United States in 1947 and considered by some scholars as the most important reform of the entire post-war period. The reform proposed, through forced expropriation, the distribution of land to agricultural laborers, thus making them small entrepreneurs and no longer subject to the large landowner. If in some ways the reform had this beneficial result, for others it significantly reduced the size of farms, effectively removing any possibility of transforming them into advanced businesses. This negative element was mitigated and in some cases eliminated by forms of cooperatives.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

A number of progressive reforms were introduced during Colombo&#x27;s time as prime minister. A housing reform law of 22 October 1971 introduced new criteria for land expropriations and provisions for urban renewals. Under a law of 6 December 1971, state funds were made available for the construction of a kindergarten in every local authority. A law of 30 December 1971 introduced new regulations covering protection of female workers and maternity insurance. The duration of maternity leave was extended two months prior to, and two months after confinement for all employees, and all female workers were entitled to an earnings-related indemnity, equal to 80% of earnings, including agricultural workers and tenant farmers. Also introduced was an entitlement to voluntary extra period of leave for six months during the first year of the child&#x27;s life, with job security and an indemnity equal to 30% of earnings, together with an entitlement to paid absences due to the child&#x27;s sickness during the first three years if the child&#x27;s life. In addition, a special natality allowance was introduced for self-employed women in the agricultural, artisan, and commercial sectors.
Between 1977 and 1979, Colombo was the president of the European Parliament. From 1980 to 1983 and again from 1992 to 1993, he was foreign minister of Italy.

==Later life==
In 2003, then president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi bestowed Italy&#x27;s highest political honour on him by nominating him senator for life. In the first five years as lifetime senator, he was an independent politician. From 2008 until his death in June 2013, Colombo was a member of the For the Autonomies group, formed mainly by elects in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. After the inconclusive 2023 Italian general election and the following difficulties of the Senate of the Republic in electing a presiding officer, Colombo became its provisional president until the election of Pietro Grasso on 16 March 2013. The most oldest senator, former prime minister Giulio Andreotti was due to inaugurate the new legislature but his unavailability benefited Colombo. After the death of Andreotti on 6 May 2013, Colombo became the last surviving member of the Italian Constituent Assembly.

==Personal life==
In November 2003, Colombo admitted to have used cocaine for therapeutic purposes over a 12- to 18-month period. He died in Rome on 24 June 2013 at the age of 93.

== Honours and awards ==

*Iran: Commemorative Medal of the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire
*Italy: Knight of Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic

<text>Gerard Francis Gisborne Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes OBE, MA (7 June 1906 – 25 May 1985) was a British railway manager who rose through the ranks of the London and North Eastern Railway and later British Rail following graduation from the University of Oxford. British Rail fired him in 1967 for publishing an outspoken and critical book, &quot;I Tried to Run a Railway&quot;.

==Early life and family==

He was educated at Winchester College and Hertford College, Oxford and then joined the London and North Eastern Railway as a Traffic Apprentice in 1928.

He was related to the actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes, and the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

==Railway career==
After his apprenticeship his subsequent appointments included:
* Assistant Yardmaster, Whitemoor Yard, Cambridgeshire, 1932
* Chief Controller, , 1934.
* Various appointments at , London Liverpool Street station, Edinburgh, and .
*De facto District Operating Superintendent, Cambridge, during the early wartime.
* District Operating Superintendent, , 1943.
* District Operating Superintendent, , east London, 1944.
* Operating Superintendent, Eastern Region, British Rail, 1956–57.
* Line Traffic Manager, London King&#x27;s Cross station, 1957–61.
* Chief Operating Officer, British Railways Board, 1961–63.
* Chairman of the Western Region Board and General Manager, Western Region BR, 1963–65.
* Chairman of the Eastern Region Board and General Manager, Eastern Region, BR, 1965–67.

Starting in 1930 as a Traffic Apprentice, Fiennes gained a broad yet deep understanding of railway operations and economics. Fiennes&#x27; principles were that &quot;the railway is judged by the comfort, speed, convenience, safety, punctuality and economy of its services&quot;. Consequently, he was prepared to discontinue services which could not be made to cover their costs and believed that unprofitable lines should be kept open only if there was a political will to underwrite the losses. On the other hand, Fiennes believed strongly in growing traffic and using resources intensively through aggressive scheduling and that, in order to compete with air and road, the average end-to-end speed of passenger trains had to be at least . Such speeds required much higher power locomotives than British Railways was ordering in large numbers at the time. As Line Traffic Manager of the East Coast Main Line in the late 1950s he was largely responsible for pushing for the purchase by BR of the 22 English Electric/ Napier &quot;Deltic&quot; locomotives in 1959 (in service 1961–82). These were deemed necessary as they were capable of prolonged running at , in order to provide the non-electrified East Coast route with a level of service comparable with that of the electrified West Coast Main Line. As Chief Operating Officer at the British Railways Board at a time when a fleet of 100,000 freight wagons managed an average of just 20 journeys per year, he devised the &quot;Merry-go-Round&quot; (MGR) concept for continuous operation of coal and ore trains with loading and unloading on the move but was unable to overcome procrastination by his superiors and by the National Coal Board (which would have to invest in modern loading facilities) for several years. When finally introduced, MGR brought about drastic increases in efficiency and reductions in cost of bulk transport by rail. In one case, a proposed investment in 550 conventional wagons of 24.5 tonnes&#x27; capacity was replaced with 44 MGR wagons of 32.5 tonnes&#x27; capacity. On the Eastern Region in the mid-1960s he demonstrated that large savings could be made on unprofitable lines by use of the idea of a basic railway with less costly infrastructure, using track singling, unstaffed stations with larger car parks and fares collected on the trains.

He was dismissed from British Rail in 1967 for publishing the autobiographical book &quot;I Tried to Run a Railway&quot;, which was outspoken about the management of British Rail and government policy changes and particularly critical of the frequent management re-organisations that the railways had gone through since nationalisation.

==Later life==
Following his main railway career, Fiennes was a director of Hargreaves Group between 1968 and 1976. He was a director of the railway publishers Ian Allan Ltd, who had published his book, and for whose rail industry magazines he had previously written extensively. He served as Mayor of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, in 1976. Fiennes continued his association with railways by accepting an invitation to join the board of directors of the independent, narrow gauge, Ffestiniog Railway Company, in north Wales, on which he served between 1968 and 1974. Between 1970 and 1974 he was the company&#x27;s nominee to the Board of Directors of the Ffestiniog Railway Society, the voluntary supporters&#x27; organisation.

<text>Water-miscible oil paint (also called water-soluble oil paint or water-mixable oil paint) is oil paint either engineered or to which an emulsifier has been added, allowing it to be thinned and cleaned up with water. These paints make it possible to avoid using, or at least reduce volatile organic compounds such as turpentine that may be harmful if inhaled. Water-miscible oil paint can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. One of the ways its water solubility comes from is the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been engineered to be hydrophilic and thus bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution. This type of paint is different to those that are engineered to enable cleaning of brushes and application equipment in water but are not in themselves water reducible.

== History ==
A precursor to water-miscible oil paint is &quot;tempera grassa&quot;, an egg tempera method where oil paint is mixed with the tempera and the egg acts an emulsifier to be used for glazing underpaintings and providing added luminosity to paintings.

==Handling in comparison with other media==
The traditional rule of gradation of layers — &quot;fat over lean,&quot; or flexible over less flexible — applies to water miscible oil paint as it does to traditional oil, and in this respect the two kinds of paint behave in the same way. However, their handling is slightly different: when thinned with water to a considerably liquid phase, water miscible oil paint tends to feel and behave like watercolor (although, unlike watercolor, and to a greater extent than traditional oil, it may lose adhesion to the ground or support if over-thinned); by contrast, when used as a short paste without water for heavy impasto work, it tends to drag, developing a consistency somewhat &quot;gummier&quot; or tackier than the more buttery one characteristic of oils. At midrange (between short paste and long paste) water miscible oil paint is gouache-like, sharing the properties of both transparent watercolor and opaque oil (in the manner of watercolor, for example, some colors will darken upon drying, the more so as more water is mixed into the paint, and in the manner of oil, the paint film will have some thickness to it). Also gouache-like is the overall effect, which tends to be matte as compared to the glossier oil, but this too is a property that will vary, depending on the pigment used and on any mediums (or diluents) mixed into it, as well as on the pastiness of the paint (as a general rule, the pastier, the glossier). The handling of water miscible oil paint, in summary, changes considerably as it passes from one phase to another. This makes it a versatile medium but, by the same token, it also requires the artist to develop by experience specific skills with which to successfully manipulate it and exploit its range to achieve the desired effect.

Although the practice of mixing water-mixable oils with acrylics is possible (as some brands claim), it is not recommended if the painting&#x27;s longevity is a concern. The reason is that once the acrylic dries, its impermeability isolates the oil from oxygen, preventing it from oxidizing properly.

Since each manufacture of these paints has its own formula for creating the water-mixable capacity, the following should be checked with each manufacturer’s paint. As the artist writing this paragraph uses Lukas Berlin water-mixable oils, the following applies to Lukas Berlin. They are quite stable on acrylic gesso primed surfaces. Therefore, after all polymerization has occurred, when subjected to a damaging force can with stand quite some force without suffering damage to the paint film. The same is not true when they are applied to oil primed, or oil ground surfaces, i.e., canvas, canvas board, or paper. When fully dried the paint is not fully attached to the oil primed surface. It is easily damaged by any force acted upon it. Subsequent testing has established that Royal Talents’ - Cobra, Holbein Works’ - Duo and Daniel Smith’s - Water Soluble Oil Colors also exhibit the same problem with oil primed surfaces.

==Brands==
There are several manufacturers producing water miscible oil paint, including: Daler-Rowney (Georgian Water Mixable Oil);Mont Marte (H2O Water Mixable Oil); Daniel Smith (Water Soluble Oil Colors); Grumbacher (Max Water Mixable Oil); Holbein Works (DUO); Lukas (BERLIN); Martin F. Weber Co. (wOil); Reeves (tube sets and complete painting set); Royal Talens (Cobra Artist and Cobra Study); Schmincke (Norma Blue Water Mixable Oil); and Winsor &amp; Newton (Artisan Water Mixable Oil Color).

==Mediums==
Although this type of paint may be thinned with water, artists may prefer to use specially prepared mediums for improved texture and control. These mediums improve flow (i.e., make the thinned paint less runny and more easily controlled) and can slow or speed up drying time. Mediums are offered by many of the paint manufacturers.

Royal Talens also has produced a water mixable painting paste that acts as a thickener as well as transparetizer which will not change the consistency of the paint. There are many documented issues with accelerator products in this category causing cracking and damaging the archivability of the medium.

Winsor and Newton has created a special line of oils, mediums, varnishes, and thinners to complement their “Artisan” brand of water mixable oil colors. This line includes thinner, linseed oil, safflower oil, stand oil, painting medium, fast drying medium, and impasto medium, as well as gloss varnish, matt varnish, satin varnish, and varnish remover.

Daniel Smith also offers a range of suitable mediums.

<doc id="983287" wikidata="Q162930" url="?curid=983287" title="Explorations (Bill Evans album)">
<text>Explorations is an album by jazz pianist Bill Evans that was originally released by Riverside Records in 1961. It was the second and final studio album Evans recorded with his classic trio featuring Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums.

==Background==
The album is a follow-up to the trio&#x27;s first recording from two years earlier, &quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot;. The delay in making a new record was largely attributable to Evans&#x27;s drug habit and resulting hepatitis, which led LaFaro to play and record in the meantime with Ornette Coleman. When &quot;Explorations&quot; was finally recorded, it was not under happy circumstances. As Evans biographer Keith Shadwick relates: &quot;Tension ... simmered, particularly between Evans and the abrasive LaFaro, who made no secret of his disgust at Evans&#x27;s addiction. LaFaro played on a borrowed instrument, while the pianist was quickly complaining of a headache, probably brought on by the strain in the studio.&quot; Nonetheless, the resulting album turned out to be an influential and enduring classic that &quot;brilliantly illustrates [Evans&#x27;s] innovative concept of &#x27;simultaneous improvisation.&#x27;&quot;

==Repertoire==
The album&#x27;s eight original tracks include five jazz standards and three modern jazz compositions. &quot;Explorations&quot; opens with a cover of John Carisi&#x27;s &quot;Israel,&quot; which had first been recorded by Miles Davis on the second &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; session. The trio also covers Davis&#x27;s own &quot;Nardis,&quot; which Evans had first recorded in 1958 with Cannonball Adderley. Ted Gioia notes that &quot;you could trace Evans&#x27;s entire career by studying his different interpretations of this composition over the years, documented by more than 30 recordings.&quot; Also included is the ballad-waltz &quot;Elsa&quot; composed by Evans&#x27;s friend Earl Zindars. Peter Pettinger comments that &quot;Evans began it with an air of mystery, like the unveiling of a secret, the gentle introduction melting imperceptibly into the tune.&quot; Evans would record it again just a few weeks later with Adderley for the album &quot;Know What I Mean?&quot; and then revisit it a few years later on &quot;Trio &#x27;65&quot;. A number of later live versions through 1975 are also in circulation, and Evans would record several other Zindars compositions through the years.

Pettinger notes that the treatment of Irving Berlin&#x27;s classic song &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean?&quot; was &quot;remarkable at the time for leaving the melody till the end.&quot; Unlike Evans&#x27;s three previously released trio recordings, &quot;Explorations&quot; includes no originals by the pianist.

==Reception==

The album won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Critics Best Piano LP poll for 1961.

David Rickert of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; wrote, &quot;Evans demands to be heard, seducing you with his indelibly emotional playing. ... The trio works magic here, breathing fresh air into standards such as &#x27;How Deep Is the Ocean?&#x27; and &#x27;Beautiful Love&#x27; and creating the illusion that these songs were written just so someone like Evans could play them. The highlight of the album is &#x27;Elsa,&#x27; which is one of the most beautiful piano ballads on record.&quot;

Writing for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, critic Thom Jurek said of the album: &quot;Evans, with Paul Motian and Scott LaFaro, was onto something as a trio, exploring the undersides of melodic and rhythmic constructions that had never been considered by most. ... &quot;Explorations&quot; is an extraordinary example of the reach and breadth of this trio at its peak.&quot;

==Reissues==
The album was remastered and reissued on compact disc by Riverside/Original Jazz Classics in 1987 with two bonus tracks. In the liner notes, producer Orrin Keepnews discusses these additional recordings, &quot;Beautiful Love (take 1)&quot; and &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;; the first version of &quot;Beautiful Love&quot; included on the original LP was a second take. In fact, as Keepnews specifies, &quot;this is not the usual case of a second attempt that immediately followed the first. ... Early in this date, [Evans] played this number once; we both approved, and he moved on to something else. Much later, he decided to try a second &#x27;Beautiful Love,&#x27; which he later preferred.&quot; &quot;The Boy Next Door,&quot; on the other hand, was set aside at the time of the LP, because of the limited space available on the album.

In 2011, a new CD edition was released with two more bonus tracks, alternate takes of &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean?&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Knew.&quot;

<doc id="983297" wikidata="Q677259" url="?curid=983297" title="Heinkel He 114">
<text>The Heinkel He 114 was a sesquiplane reconnaissance seaplane produced for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in the 1930s for use from warships. It replaced the company&#x27;s He 60, but it did not remain in service long before being replaced by the Arado Ar 196, Germany&#x27;s standard observation seaplane.

==Design and development==
While the fuselage and flotation gear of the He 114 were conventional, it used a sesquiplane wing, with a much smaller lower wing. The upper wings were attached to the fuselage with cabane struts, and the lower wings were of reduced span but a similar chord.

==Operational history==

The He 114 was never a great success, was not built in large numbers, and served with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for only a short time. While the He 60 had handled very well on the water but been sluggish in the air, the He 114&#x27;s handling while afloat was poor and its performance in the air scarcely better than the aircraft it replaced.

A total of 24 aircraft were exported to Romania, where the last 8 remained in service until 1 May 1960. In July 1943 Spain acquired 12 aircraft of the A and C variants, they were retired in 1954.

On 1 November 1939 Sweden ordered 12 aircraft of the B-1 variant. The aircraft were planned to be delivered in December the same year but was soon rescheduled to Spring the following year. In April 1940 Sweden increased the order by 24 aircraft, Heinkel responded by informing that the original order would not be delivered as the German government had enacted a ban on military materiel export to Sweden. When the ban was lifted, the 12 aircraft originally intended for Sweden had already been taken into service of the Luftwaffe. By the end of 1940 Germany gave notice that it could deliver 12 aircraft, Sweden accepted but Germany soon cancelled the order. The purchase could, however, be realized in 1941 and 12 used He 114 arrived in Sweden dismantled in boxes in the spring of the same year. The airplanes were assembled and given a complete overhaul before entering service at Roslagens flygflottilj (F2) in Hägernäs under the designation S 12 (&quot;S&quot; being an abbreviation for &#x27;reconnaissance aircraft&#x27; in Sweden).

The &quot;hilfskreuzer&quot; , and were equipped with two He 114 each. They made extensive use of these aircraft during their raiding careers in 1940-41, until the aircraft were lost or worn out. Some were replaced by Arado&#x27;s brought by supply ships whilst they were still at large.

==Surviving aircraft==
In 2012, two divers discovered the wreckage of a Heinkel 114 at the bottom of Lake Siutghiol, in Romania. Near the Heinkel were also sections of two other seaplanes: a Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 (initially thought to be a Savoia-Marchetti S.55) and a Junkers W 34 (discovered in 2013). The wrecks were recovered by Romanian Navy divers in October 2012, and are stored at the .

<doc id="983300" wikidata="Q3586305" url="?curid=983300" title="2004 Alberta general election">
<text>The 2004 Alberta general election was held on November 22, 2004 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.

The election was called on October 25, 2004. Premier Ralph Klein decided to go to the polls earlier than the legislated deadline of March 2006. This election was held in conjunction with the 2004 Alberta Senate nominee election.

When the election was called, it was expected to be anticlimactic, with Klein cruising to his fourth straight majority, the tenth for his Progressive Conservative Party.

Shortly after the drop of the writs, Klein&#x27;s mother died and all parties suspended their campaigns for several days. After the campaign resumed, Klein avoided making any policy announcements and attended few events. One commentator called it &quot;Kleinfeld: the campaign about nothing&quot; (a reference to the television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;). The Liberal Party, which had hoped to hold on to the five seats it had and regain the two seats that it had lost to resignations, began to pick up momentum and became far more optimistic.

In the end, the Conservatives were re-elected, despite losing 11 seats and 15% of the popular vote, having dropped to a minority position in the polls. The Liberals more than doubled their seats by electing 17 MLAs on election night The Liberals dominated in Edmonton and made strong inroads in Calgary.

The Alberta New Democrats (NDP) held on to their two seats and gained two more, all in Edmonton.

The Conservatives swept rural Alberta except for one seat that went to the Alberta Alliance, which also placed second in a number of rural ridings. The Conservatives received no more than 56 percent of the vote in any of the three rural regions so was very much over-represented by its almost-total one-party sweep of the rural seats.

The Alberta Greens gained in the popular vote, jumping from 0.3% in the 2001 election to 2.8%, and placed third in some places. Despite placing second in the riding of Drayton Valley-Calmar ahead of the Liberals, it did not win any seats.

Social Credit placed third in a number of ridings, and its leader tied for second in Rocky Mountain House.

The Conservative, Liberal and NDP leaders all easily held onto their own seats.

== Electoral System ==
Alberta&#x27;s 83 MLAs were elected through First-past-the-post voting in 83 single-member districts.

== Election night summary ==

Overall voter turnout was 45.12%.
Note:
:* The Alberta Alliance and Alberta Party did not contest the 2001 election.
:1 The Separation Party results are compared to the Alberta First Party.
:2 A judicial recount changed the results in Edmonton Castle Downs, Liberal. Chris Kibermanis lost to Progressive Conservative Thomas Lukaszuk.

== Results by region ==
1 &quot;Edmonton&quot; corresponds to only the city of Edmonton. (Only the ridings whose names begin with &quot;Edmonton&quot;.) The four suburban ridings around the city as listed below are grouped with Central Alberta in this table.

== Electoral re-distribution ==
Alberta&#x27;s electoral laws fix the number of legislature seats at 83. As a result of the Alberta Electoral Boundary Re-distribution, 2004, Calgary gained two seats. Edmonton lost one seat, and one &quot;special consideration&quot; division was eliminated. Dunvegan-Central Peace is the sole remaining &quot;special&quot; division - due to its isolation, it is allowed to have a population below 75% of the provincial average. Lesser Slave Lake is now considered to be a standard rural division as its boundaries were re-drawn so that its population is slightly above 75% of the provincial average. One urbanized division outside Calgary and Edmonton was added, and two rural seats were eliminated.

== Political parties ==

For this election, there were 11 political parties registered with Elections Alberta.

=== Parties that elected MLAs in the previous election ===
&quot;The parties are listed in descending order of number of MLAs elected in 2001.&quot;

==== Progressive Conservative Party ====
Leader: Ralph Klein

In the 2001 election, the Progressive Conservatives recorded a result that was comparable to those achieved in their years of dominance under Peter Lougheed. The Tories received 627,252 out of 1,013,152 votes cast and won 74 seats, gaining 11 seats over and above their 1997 result at the expense of the Liberals. This result was achieved due to a resurgence of the party in Edmonton, where the Tories won a majority of seats for the first time since 1982. Premier Ralph Klein easily retained his Calgary-Elbow seat.

On April 8, 2002, Doug Griffiths retained the Tories&#x27; seat in Wainwright in the only by-election held since the 2001 election, albeit with a substantially reduced plurality. The Tories lost only one seat since the 2001 election, after Edmonton-Norwood MLA Gary Masyk crossed the floor to join the Alberta Alliance. As expected, the Tories nominated a full slate of candidates for the 2004 election.

==== Liberal Party ====
Leader: Kevin Taft

The 2001 election was generally regarded to be as a disaster for the Liberals. Although the Liberals retained Official Opposition status and received 276,854 votes, the party lost 11 seats to the Tories and won only seven seats, six of them in Edmonton. Leader Nancy Macbeth even lost her own seat in Edmonton-McClung - she resigned days after the election and was replaced by Ken Nicol, the Opposition&#x27;s sole representative outside the capital.

Nicol eventually resigned as MLA for Lethbridge East and as Leader of the Opposition to run (unsuccessfully) for the Liberals in the federal election, as did Edmonton-Ellerslie MLA Debby Carlson. These seats remained vacant through dissolution. The Liberals were led in the 2004 election by Edmonton-Riverview MLA Kevin Taft, who was elected to the position in March 2004. The Liberals had 82 candidates in the 2004 election - they were absent from the ballot in Drumheller-Stettler after failing to file papers for their expected candidate, Don McMann before the deadline.

External link

==== New Democratic Party ====
Leader: Brian Mason

In 2001, the New Democrats were unable to claim Official Opposition status from the floundering Liberals, but Leader Raj Pannu managed to hold the party&#x27;s two existing seats—Pannu&#x27;s own in Edmonton—Strathcona and Brian Mason&#x27;s seat in Edmonton Highlands (later merged into Edmonton Highlands-Norwood). The &quot;NDs&quot;, as they were then known, received 81,339 votes. Pannu resigned the leadership in July 2004, with Mason filling the role of interim leader before being elected to that position in September 2004. The party has also ceased abbreviating its name as &quot;ND in favour of the more traditional &quot;NDP&quot; abbreviation. The NDP nominated a full slate of candidates for the 2004 election.

=== Other registered parties ===
&quot;The parties are listed in descending order of number of candidates nominated in 2004.&quot;

==== Alberta Alliance ====
Leader: Randy Thorsteinson

The Alberta Alliance was registered in October 2002 and held its founding convention in February 2003. Its leader, Randy Thorsteinson had led Social Credit through a modest rebirth before quitting that party in April 1999. The party&#x27;s sole MLA, Gary Masyk (Edmonton-Norwood) crossed the floor from the governing Progressive Conservatives on June 29, 2004. The Alliance nominated a full slate of candidates for the 2004 election, the only other party besides the Tories and the NDP to do so.

External link

==== Greens ====
Leader: George Read

Also known as the &quot;Green Party of Alberta&quot;, the Alberta Greens ran 10 candidates in the 2001 election, who combined for 2,850 votes. In the 2004 election, the Greens nominated 49 candidates - more than 4 times the highest number of candidates they had previously run in an election.

External link

==== Social Credit Party ====
Leader: Lavern Ahlstrom

Prior to the 2001 election, the Social Credit Party was in turmoil following the departure of party leader Randy Thorsteinson. Under Lavern Ahlstrom, the party nominated 12 candidates in the 2001 election (down from 70 in 1997), and received 5,361 votes (down from 64,667). The party had 42 candidates for the 2004 election.

External link

==== Separation Party ====
Interim Leader: Bruce Hutton

The Separation Party of Alberta was founded in June 2004 taking over the rights of the Alberta First Party. Bruce Hutton became interim leader. As a separatist party, it is the separatist successor to the Alberta Independence Party, which ran some independent candidates in the 2001 election, but never achieved official party status. The separatist cause was first taken up by the Western Canada Concept in the early 1980s when Gordon Kesler won a by-election. The Separation Party had 12 candidates in the 2004 election. See Alberta separatism.

==== Reform Party ====
Leader: David Salmon

The Alberta Party, Equity Party and the Reform Party did not run any candidates in the 2001 election. The Equity Party and Reform Party were also absent from the ballot in 2004.

<text>FILE_ID.DIZ is a plain-text file containing a brief description of the content of the archive to which it belongs.
Such files were originally used in archives distributed through bulletin board systems (BBSes) and is still used in the warez scene. stands for &quot;file identification&quot;. stands for &quot;description in zipfile&quot;.

Traditionally, a FILE_ID.DIZ should be &quot;up to 10 lines of text, each line being no more than 45 characters long&quot;, according to v.1.9 of the specification. The concept of .DIZ files was to allow for a concise description of uploaded files to be automatically applied.

==History==
Bulletin boards commonly accept uploaded files from their users. The BBS software would prompt the user to supply a description for the uploaded file, but these descriptions were often less than useful. BBS system operators spent many hours going over the upload descriptions correcting and editing the descriptions. The inclusion in archives was designed to address this problem.

Clark Development and the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) supported the idea of this becoming a standard for file descriptions. Clark rewrote the PCBDescribe program and included it with their PCBoard BBS software. The ASP urged their members to use this description file format in their distributions. Michael Leavitt, an employee of Clark Development, released the file specification and his PCBDescribe program source code to the public domain and urged other BBS software companies to support the DIZ file.

SysOps could add a common third-party script written in PPL, called &quot;DIZ/2-PCB&quot; that would process, rewrite, verify, and format DIZ files from archives as they were uploaded to a BBS. The software would extract the archive, examine the contents, compile a report, import the DIZ description file and then format it according to your liking. During this time, it was usual practice to add additional lines to the description, such as ads exclaiming the source of the uploaded BBS.

Even since the decline of the dial-up bulletin board system, FILE_ID.DIZ files are still utilized by the warez scene in their releases of unlicensed software. They are commonly bundled as part of the complete packaging by pirate groups, and indicate the number of disks, and other basic information. Along with the NFO file, it is essential to the release.

==Formal structure==
While real-world use among BBSs varied, with the NPD world and even different BBS brands coming up with expanded versions, the official format is:

Plain, 7-bit ASCII text, each line no more than 45 characters wide.

# Program/file name: Ideally, all uppercase and followed by one space. Carriage returns are ignored in this file.
# Version number: In the format &quot;v1.123&quot;, followed by a space.
# ASP number: Only if an actual ASP member, otherwise ignored.
# Description separator: A single short hyphen &quot;-&quot;.
# Description: The description of the file. The first two lines should be the short summary, as older boards cut off the rest. Anything beyond that should be extended description, for up to eight lines, the official cut-off size. Additional text could be included beyond that but might not be included by the board.

Many archives would stick strictly to the 45-character plain ASCII format for the first 8 lines, then contain an appended 80-character wide 8-bit ASCII or ANSI graphic page with better-formatted documentation after that.

<doc id="983306" wikidata="Q5447575" url="?curid=983306" title="Fifth Ward, Houston">
<text>The Fifth Ward, nicknamed the Nickel, is a community of Houston, Texas, United States, derived from a historical political district (ward), about northeast of Downtown. Its boundaries are Buffalo Bayou on the south, Little White Oak Bayou on the west, Collingsworth Rd on the north, and Lockwood Drive on the east.

The Fifth Ward, one of the six wards of Houston, was created partly from two other wards, the First Ward, which ceded the area to the north and east of White Oak Bayou and Little White Oak Bayou, and the Second Ward, which ceded all land within the Houston city limits to the north of Buffalo Bayou.

==History==

===Early history===

In its initial history, the Fifth Ward had many ethnic groups. Large numbers of the residents were Irish and Jews; the latter had fled pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe, and lived mostly in the eastern parts, while the former lived mainly in the north. Richard West of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; characterized the early Fifth Ward as being &quot;prosperous&quot;.

After the American Civil War, newly freed slaves began settling in the sparsely settled area. In 1866, it became the Fifth Ward and an alderman from the ward was elected to Houston&#x27;s City Council. By the mid-1880s, it was virtually all black, home to working-class people who made their livings in Houston&#x27;s eastside ship channel and industrial areas or as domestics for wealthy Houstonians. Mount Vernon United Methodist Church, founded in 1865 by a former slave, is the oldest church in the ward. Five other churches are over a hundred years old. Also home to the famous &quot;Island of Hope (Anderson Memorial Temple) COGIC&quot; the oldest Pentecostal church in Fifth Ward. Over the years it had been home to the city&#x27;s minority and immigrant population. Additional waves of Irish people, as well as Germans and Italians settled the Fifth Ward.

In the late 1800s the Fifth Ward community threatened to secede from the city of Houston twice, in 1875 and 1883. Complaints about inadequate municipal services, including fire and police services, lighting, sanitation, and drainage, occurred during this time period. The 1875 secession complaint asked for the paving of streets and upgrades to the utility system. The city government ameliorated the 1883 complaints by establishing a drawbridge at San Jacinto Street that crossed the Buffalo Bayou. It paved parts of Odin Avenue, now known as Lyons Avenue, in brick in the 1890s. The pavement ended two blocks after the residence of Mayor of Houston John T. Browne.

On February 21, 1912, with stiff Northern winds blowing in, the largest fire in Houston&#x27;s history began. This fire became known as the &quot;Great Fifth Ward Fire&quot;. The strong winds spread the fire as embers set wood-shingled roofs on fire. It consumed a church, school, 13 industrial plants, eight stores, and 119 homes, mostly located in the Fifth Ward. There were no deaths, but there was over $3 million in property damage.

===Post-World War I to the mid-20th century===
In the post-World War I period the neighborhood makeup changed as a wave of African-Americans settled the Fifth Ward. The housing density increased as families put more people in each building in order to pay their rent. The buildings, occupied by too many people, began to deteriorate. Some Jewish people remained as landlords, but most of them moved away, with many of them going to New York City, including The Bronx; and Long Island.

Before desegregation the community housed African-Americans of all occupations and income levels. The community was known as the &quot;bloody Fifth&quot; because of some highly publicized violent incidents in the neighborhood; Michael Berryhill of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; stated that the Fifth Ward was not as blighted in the 1940s as it was during the 1990s. Robb Walsh of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described the 1930s era Fifth Ward as &quot;one of the proudest black neighborhoods&quot; in the US; more than 40 black-owned businesses were along Lyons Avenue in the Fifth Ward at that time.

In the post-World War II period a large number of black migrants, many of them from Louisiana and some from East Texas and other areas in the Deep South, settled the Fifth Ward. The community became characterized by poverty since many of these migrants were unable to get non-menial jobs.

In 1949 Brown &amp; Root began buying land in the Fifth Ward for its headquarters.

When Interstate 10 was built, it went through the Fifth Ward, dividing the community.

The city government established some pocket parks and added pavement, gutters, and curbing to several streets in the southernmost part of the Fifth Ward in the period 1964-1974, during the term of Mayor of Houston Louie Welch.

===1970s and 1980s===
Desegregation led middle class African-Americans to move to the suburbs. By the 1970s the Fifth Ward lost a significant part of its population, and many houses were boarded-up. Many area businesses were vacant and the area had many vacant lots with overgrown plants. In 1974 Whit described the neighborhood as &quot;one of Houston&#x27;s poorest ghettos&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s the Fifth Ward became notorious throughout Houston for the violence perpetrated in the community. Ernest McMillan, a community activist and contributor to the Fifth Ward Enrichment Program, said in a 1987 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article that &quot;One of the differences between this neighborhood and one like River Oaks is that they have lots of support and all kinds of resources available. Here in the Fifth Ward it&#x27;s the exact opposite: These people have no resources at all. There&#x27;s one clinic, one library, no YMCA, very few activities, and the community is very fragmented. It&#x27;s not the kind of environment that helps a child excel.&quot;

As of 1979 the median income in the Fifth Ward was $5,030 ($ adjusted for inflation), 25% of Fifth Ward residents had high school diplomas, and 34% of Fifth Ward residents lived below the poverty line. The respective citywide averages were a median income of $9,876 ($ adjusted for inflation), a percentage of those with high school diplomas of 52%, and a poverty line percentage of 10%. By 1979 only a few Italian American families remained in the Fifth Ward. By that year, black flight from the Fifth Ward to Kashmere Gardens, South Park, Sunnyside, and Trinity Gardens had occurred.

West wrote in 1979 that about 90% of the Fifth Ward was characterized by &quot;physical ugliness&quot; and &quot;poverty&quot; while there are some middle class &quot;pockets of affluence&quot; that do not have physical indications of troubled neighborhoods. At the time the Fifth Ward was more dense in terms of population than most Houston neighborhoods. The average Fifth Ward housing density was 9.14 and there were 30.5 persons per residential acre, while Houston&#x27;s citywide average density and persons per residential acre were 4.98 and 14.4, respectively. In addition, 21% of city blocks had no drainage systems, while 39% had open ditches and 40% had storm sewers. West stated that the Fifth Ward&#x27;s physical character was not like that of Harlem in New York City or Roxbury in Boston. In 1974 Whit Canning of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; stated that the Fifth Ward was characterized by a &quot;project-type apartment complex&quot;, &quot;narrow streets&quot; and &quot;small stores&quot;. West wrote that the Fifth Ward had its environment &quot;out in the open, on the street&quot; and that it had &quot;more barbershops, pawnshops, churches, loose dogs, abandoned buildings, bars, broken windows&quot; while there were &quot;fewer sidewalks, streetlights, fire hydrants, culverts, curbs, parks, jewelers, museums, libraries, garbage trucks.&quot;

In 1970 metal manufacturer Moncrief-Lenoir Manufacturing Company planned an urban renewal project, spending $10 million to buy of land along Lyons Avenue&#x27;s western end, but nothing was built by 1979. It was scheduled to be one of the largest urban renewal projects in the United States.

===1990s and onward===
Between 1990 and 2000 the Hispanic population of the Fifth Ward increased from around 19% of the population to around 31% as Hispanics in the Houston area moved into majority black neighborhoods. In the same period, the black population of the Fifth Ward declined by 3,286 as majority African-American neighborhoods in Houston had declines in their black populations.

In 2000 the median annual income was $8,900. 62% of its residents lived below the poverty line. 9 of 10 school-aged children qualified for free or reduced lunches. The commercial streets had several empty buildings and vacant lots. Lisa Gray, a journalist in the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, stated in a 2000 article that the existing businesses &quot;run mostly to dingy mom-and-pop operations, grim little grocery stores and cheerless liquor stores. There&#x27;s no McDonald&#x27;s, no Fiesta, no Target, no Wal-Mart. It&#x27;s turf where national chains fear to tread.&quot; Gray added that the words &quot;new&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; were not often associated with the Fifth Ward, while &quot;at-risk,&quot; &quot;crime,&quot; and &quot;poverty,&quot; were. Walsh said that the Fifth Ward in 2002 was &quot;in much better shape&quot; than it was in the 1970s; he added that while the Fifth Ward is &quot;hardly a garden spot,&quot; the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation took many steps to improve the community including assisting low income borrowers in finding loans, encouraging architects to develop &quot;innovative designs&quot; for low income housing, and bringing commercial building projects into the Fifth Ward.

Japhet, a section of the Fifth Ward at Emile Street at Clinton Drive (two blocks east of Hirsch Road/Waco Street), was the &quot;Houston Press&quot; 2004 &quot;Best Hidden Neighborhood.&quot; The article stated &quot;Say the words &quot;Fifth Ward&quot; to most Houstonians, and they&#x27;ll think crime, poverty and desperation.&quot; The article added that Japhet is &quot;more like a village than anything else -- fragrant organic gardens are everywhere, bursting with vegetables, fruits and flowers, and the whole neighborhood comes together for a big party every full moon.&quot;

In 2007 the Fifth Ward was one of several Houston neighborhoods with a high concentration of felons. During that year a debate regarding the ownership of the historic Evergreen Negro Cemetery in the Fifth Ward continued. Some Hurricane Katrina evacuees also moved from Southwest Houston and lived in other parts of Houston such as the Fifth Ward.

In 2020 a survey concluded that 43% of area families had at least one member diagnosed with cancer.

==Demographics==
In 2015 the Greater Fifth Ward Super Neighborhood had 19,687 residents. 48% were Black, 46% were Hispanic, 4% were White, and 1% each was Asian and others. In 2000 the super neighborhood had 22,211 residents. 63% were non-Hispanic black, 35% were Hispanic, and 1% were non-Hispanic white; the percentages of non-Hispanic Asians and others were zero.

In 1870 16% of the African Americans in Houston lived in the Fifth Ward, and in 1910 21% of the African Americans in Houston lived in the Fifth Ward.

==Government and infrastructure==

Greater Fifth Ward is currently located in City Council Districts B and H. As of 2024, Tarsha Jackson represents District B and Mario Castillo Jr. represents District H. https://www.houstontx.gov/council/maps.html

The community is served by the Houston Police Department Northeast Patrol Division, headquartered at 8301 Ley Road. The Fifth Ward Storefront is located in Suite 200 at 4300 Lyons Avenue.

The Houston Fire Department operates Station 19 Fifth Ward, a part of Fire District 19, on 1811 Gregg Street. The station first opened in 1925 at the corner of Gregg and New Orleans. The current location opened in 1979 at the opposite side of the intersection. In 1979 it had the highest number of fire and ambulance, beating, cutting, dead on arrival, emergency birth and other obstetric, false alarm, sickness and shooting calls of any Houston fire station.

The Harris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District) designated the Ripley Health Center for the ZIP code 77020. The designated public hospital is Ben Taub General Hospital in the Texas Medical Center.

The Houston Housing Authority (HHA) operates several public housing properties in the Fifth Ward. The include Kelly Village and Kennedy Place. Kennedy Place first opened as a 60 unit development in 1982. The HHA used $7.8 million, including some federal stimulus funds, to redevelop the housing. The demolition of the old Kennedy Place began on December 28, 2009. In January 2011 the new Kennedy Place opened, with 108 units (20 one bedroom, 58 two bedroom, 23 three bedroom, and 4 four bedroom). It also once had Kelly Court, which was the second-ever Houston housing project that admitted African-Americans.

In 2002, open ditches were the predominant form of drainage of water in the Fifth Ward.

The Fifth Ward is in Texas&#x27;s 18th congressional district. Its representative as of 2021 is Sheila Jackson Lee.

===Multi-service center and senior center===
The city operates the Fifth Ward Multi-Service Center at 4014 Market Street, The city multi-service centers provide several services such as child care, programs for elderly residents, and rental space. in proximity to Interstate 10. The center, operated by the Houston Department of Health and Human Services, houses ten agencies, including the Fifth Ward Branch Library, American Red Cross, Harris County Juvenile Probation Program, Mayor&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Assistance Office, Neighborhood Centers Inc., and Fifth Ward Head Start. The center opened in 1977 so that various social services supporting the Fifth Ward would be located in one place. It was built for $1 million (equivalent to $ in ), and by 1979 it had a day care, a juvenile probation center, a housing counseling center, an employment center, a health clinic, a library, a senior citizen service center, and other services, provided by nine agencies. In 2005 the multi-service center served 65,000 people.

In a 2001 bond election voters approved an expansion and renovation of the multi-service center. On October 12, 2006 the city of Houston began the first phase of a renovation and expansion project for the center. The first phase, $3.4 million, included an addition of of space to the center; the expansion would include a classroom with computers for information technology purposes, a community food pantry, a demonstration kitchen used for holding cooking classes, community meeting conference space, a community event multi-purpose room, and community program administration offices. The city scheduled completion for September 2007. The city scheduled the start of the second phase, a $2 million renovation project of the original structure, after the end of the first phase.

The Department of Health and Human Services also operates the John Wesley Peavy Sr. Senior Citizens Center, adjacent to the Multi-Service Center. It was named after John Wesley Peavy Sr., an East Texas native who served as a precinct judge in the area.

==Economy==
West stated that possible reasons why the business climate in the Fifth Ward was poor, according to different people in the Fifth Ward, include a lack of effort to get investment from White people, the construction of freeways that cut off parts of the Fifth Ward, a lack of investment in the appearance of businesses, white persons leaving the Fifth Ward and taking capital, and the closing of the Lyons Avenue exit off of the Eastex Freeway, the eastern portion of U.S. Route 59 in Houston. West also stated that black flight contributed to the decline in Fifth Ward businesses.

As of 1979 most businesses in the Fifth Ward were personal service affairs common to other low income neighborhoods in the United States, such as pawnshops, funeral parlors, bars, barbershops, cleaners, cafes, and liquor stores. As of 1979 Mack Hanna, a black man from Houston, owned the Standard Savings Association, the only financial institution in the Fifth Ward.

In 2011 Jarvis Johnson, a member of the Houston City Council, said &quot;The Fifth Ward is void of jobs. There aren&#x27;t any commercial grocery stores. There aren&#x27;t any places where young people can get a job.&quot;

===Corporate presence===

KBR maintained offices in a campus on Clinton Drive, within the boundaries of the East End and the Fifth Ward. This property was along the Buffalo Bayou. As of December 2010 KBR no longer operates this office.

The KBR office complex was the former headquarters of Brown &amp; Root. Brown and Root began buying land in the Fifth Ward in 1949. It initially acquired , then it acquired an additional .

By 2001 Halliburton owned the Clinton Drive campus. In August of that year Halliburton announced that it would consolidate 8,000 local employees to office space in Westchase. Halliburton planned to relocate around 2,000 employees from Clinton Drive and the industrial facilities would have been relocated to a location that was, in that month, undetermined. Sanford Criner, a principal at real estate brokerage Trione &amp; Gordon, suggested that gentrification would turn what would have been the former Clinton Drive facility into entertainment, residential, or retail use, and that the facility would not have been redeveloped for office space usage. In December 2001 Halliburton canceled its plans to relocate employees to Westchase. Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said that it made more sense for the company to lease existing space instead of constructing new office space in times of economic downturns.

In 2010 KBR announced that it will vacate the Clinton Drive campus and move the 1,600 employees who work at the Clinton Drive office to the KBR offices in Downtown Houston. The company will then conduct an environmental cleanup of the Clinton Drive site.

==Geography==
Two majority-Hispanic (as of 2001) communities, Denver Harbor and Northside, are on either end of the Fifth Ward.

&quot;Big Tree,&quot; a tree in an area where Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 59 (Eastex Freeway) now intersect, historically has been the center of activity in the Fifth Ward and was in proximity to the terminus of the streetcar line.

Lyons Avenue serves as a primary road in the Fifth Ward. In 1979 West wrote that Lyons Avenue, named after saloon owner John Lyons, served as the &quot;Soul Street&quot; of Houston, declaring it equivalent to 125th Street in Harlem, 47th Street in Chicago, South Street in Philadelphia, Seventh and T in Washington, D.C., Tremont Street in Boston, and Springfield Avenue in Newark, New Jersey. In the 1920s the Lyons family owned many businesses along the street, originally named Odin Avenue after the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, John Mary Odin. The street received its current name in 1927. In pre-desegregation Fifth Ward, Lyons and Jensen were primary commercial avenues.

As of 1979 the intersection of Lyons Avenue and Jensen Drive was called &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; due to many violent incidents occurring there.

The southern edge of the Fifth Ward, along the Buffalo Bayou, housed farms in its early history before becoming a host of slums and the city dump by the 1920s. Cleanup of this area began when Brown and Root began establishing its headquarters in the late 1940s.

The Englewood Rail Yard, located in the eastern end of the Fifth Ward, is long. In 1979 Englewood Radar Yard was the largest rail yard in the Southern United States. The rail yard is now owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which merged with the previous owner, Southern Pacific, in 1996.

The rail yard was the location of a now-defunct wood preservation plant which is a continued source of creosote contamination to the neighborhood. This plant, as of 1979, gives a distinct odor that caused area Mexican Americans to name it &quot;el Creosote&quot;.

In 2019 the Texas Department of State Health Services conducted of a study of an area in the Fifth Ward around Lavender Street, near a creosote facility of a former rail yard, where cancer rates were higher than normal.

===Frenchtown===
In 1922, a group of Louisiana Creoles organized the Fifth Ward community of &quot;Frenchtown,&quot; which contained a largely Roman Catholic and Creole culture. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 forced many Creoles to leave Louisiana, and they settled the Frenchtown area. When new residents no longer moved to Frenchtown, the neighborhood culturally merged with the greater Fifth Ward.

==Culture==

Lisa Gray, a journalist for the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, stated in a 2000 article that the Fifth Ward has an overall sense of history and a &quot;small-scale, deep-rooted personal history, the way that, in the middle of the city, lives are intertwined in a small-town way.&quot; Many families from the area had lived in the Fifth Ward for several generations.

In previous eras, African-Americans of all social classes lived in the Fifth Ward; African-American professionals patronized businesses. After the end of segregation, African-American professionals began to patronize other neighborhoods, and members of the African-American middle class moved out of the Fifth Ward.

The north-south Southern Pacific Transportation Company railroad tracks separate the Fifth Ward from Denver Harbor. David Benson, an assistant to Harris County Commissioner El Franco Lee, described the railroad line as &quot;a semi-permeable membrane.&quot; In the 1990s many Fifth Ward African-Americans went into Denver Harbor to shop at the area supermarket and stores, while the Denver Harbor Hispanics rarely entered the Fifth Ward.

Richard West of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; wrote in 1979 that within the Fifth Ward one&#x27;s personal status &quot;is determined less by what you have than by personal qualities of wit and style and by what you know of the power structure of the street&quot;.

===Religion===
Mount Vernon United Methodist Church, founded in 1865, is the community&#x27;s oldest church, and the Fifth Ward has six churches that, as of 2011, are over 100 years old. Kate Shellnutt of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that the historic church facilities &quot;have been community strongholds.&quot;

In 1979 the largest church in the Fifth Ward was the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, with 5,600 members.

The Our Mother of Mercy Catholic Church, completed in 1930 by Creoles for Creoles, serves as a social center for the Frenchtown neighborhood.

Sherman Elementary School, outside of the Fifth Ward, serves a portion. due to the proximity of Interstate 45, Bruce Elementary experienced noise pollution and twice the amount of asthma compared to the HISD average. About 99% of the students were black or Hispanic.

Some areas are zoned to John L. McReynolds Middle School in Denver Harbor, and some areas are zoned to Lamar Fleming Middle School, north of the Fifth Ward. Phillis Wheatley High School in the Fifth Ward serves almost all of the Fifth Ward, while Northside High School (formerly Jefferson Davis High School) serves a small portion of the Fifth Ward.

Community Partners operated community services in the Fifth Ward. The Human Organizational Political and Economic Development, Inc. was established in the summer of 1967 by Methodist minister Reverend Earl Allen and operated a Black Arts Center, the Roxy Theater and published the &quot;Voice of Hope&quot;. John de Menil had been instrumental in providing funding, and the organization encountered financial difficulty&#x27;s after de Menil&#x27;s 1973 death. The Emergency School Aid act provided $164,000 in September 1978, and the National Endowment of the Arts stated that it would give a grant of $15,000 one month later. Habitat for Humanity built Fifth Ward houses beginning in 1991, with the first on Rowley Street.

It was originally known as Houston Negro Community Center of the Fifth Ward, but it received its current name before its opening. A biracial committee established the center in 1943 to improve the education, health, and welfare of Fifth Ward residents. It originally used rented facilities on Lyons Avenue, before moving into a $150,000 building on Solo Street in 1949; the center has occupied the Solo Street building since then.

<text>Cardinal is a vivid red, which may get its name from the cassocks worn by Catholic cardinals (although the color worn by cardinals is scarlet). The cardinal bird also takes its name from the cardinal bishops.

The first recorded use of &quot;cardinal&quot; as a color name in English was in the year 1698.

The corresponding Pantone Matching System (PMS) color is 200, as seen in the school colors for Wisconsin, Arizona and Wesleyan, and as one of the two official colors of the Phi Kappa Psi and Alpha Sigma Phi fraternities and the only official color of the sorority Alpha Omicron Pi. However, Stanford&#x27;s variant of the color is 201 C, while Carnegie Mellon and Worcester Polytechnic Institute use PMS 187, Brown University uses PMS 192, Iowa State University uses PMS 186, and Ball State University uses PMS 199.

The hex triplet for the web-safe version of the color is #CC2233.

<doc id="983338" wikidata="Q11680647" url="?curid=983338" title="Celes Chere">
<text>is a character and protagonist in the video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. She was created by Yoshinori Kitase and was his favorite character in the game. She struggles with allegiances between the Empire and the rebel group, the Returners before ultimately siding with the latter. She appears in other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, including the &quot;Theatrhythm&quot; series and &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;.

She has received generally positive reception, praised by critics for being a good female character. Her attempted suicide, struggles with allegiance, and opera scene are cited as among the most significant aspects of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
Celes&#x27; character and story, including her attempted suicide and opera performance, were designed by game director Yoshinori Kitase. Kitase regarded her as his favorite character in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Her appearance was designed by artist Yoshitaka Amano, who was given complete creative freedom in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, with only brief character outlines as guidelines. His approach was to create &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation as small computer sprites. Artist Kazuko Shibuya then did additional illustrations based on Amano&#x27;s design to use as a basis for her sprites, in particular her appearance during the opera scene, which she felt looked &quot;cute&quot;.

Celes&#x27; role in the game was limited at first, but this changed later in development. She was a rune knight, able to use an ability called rune; prior to that, the ability had been attached to another character named Locke Cole. Celes was originally meant to feature the &quot;conflicted spy&quot; archetype, where she would spy on the protagonists. She was also supposed to be mentally unstable like &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; antagonist Kefka.

Celes was set as the first character players controlled in the World of Ruin portion of the game to avoid giving Terra Branford&#x27;s story too much emphasis over others.
In the original release of the game, she was depicted being tortured while restrained, but this was changed in the Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; due to the lack of Computer Entertainment Rating Organization age ratings when &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was originally released.

==Appearances==
Celes first appears in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; as one of the game&#x27;s protagonists. A former general of the Empire, Celes, joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices. She becomes particularly close to Returners member Locke Cole. Celes struggles with her allegiance, at times betraying the Returners and later trying to kill Kefka. She performs at an opera house in order to fill in for a woman who was not able to fill her role. In the second half of the game, Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island, having been cared for by Cid, another person from the Empire. She discovers that the world has been sent into ruin by Kefka, that he has obtained godlike power to rule the world, and that his rule is causing all life to slowly wither away. She attempts to care for Cid, though if players do not do an adequate job feeding him, he passes away. This causes Celes to fall into despair and attempt to kill herself by jumping off a cliff. Whether he lives or dies, she discovers Locke&#x27;s bandanna, leading her to take a raft Cid had made to find if any of her compatriots had survived. Finding her friends causes her to have hope, and they use an airship to confront Kefka and end his reign.

She later appears as a playable character in the &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; series, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics S&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy: Record Keeper&quot;. She appears as a supporting character in &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;, where she received her first voice roles from Houko Kuwashima and Christina Rose in Japanese and English respectively.

==Reception==
Celes Chere has received generally positive reception following her appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. She has been regarded as one of the best characters in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, with some of the strongest moments being her opera performance, her growth from being a soldier in the Empire, and her relationship with Cid. She is particularly popular as a female character, both in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and in video games as a whole, for similar reasons. &quot;Nintendojo&quot; writer Joshua Johnston praised her for her quest to reunite the cast in the second half of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; as her standout moment. Meanwhile, writer Laura J. Peterson in a discussion with &quot;Edge&quot; praised how her emotions illustrated her character&#x27;s internal conflict, and made her a &quot;wonderful character who was integral to both the story and the gameplay.&quot;

Celes was recognized in particular for certain moments in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, including her aria and attempted suicide. &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Richard Eisenbeis discussed how the aria combined with Celes&#x27; attempted suicide drove him to tears, while fellow &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Peter Tiervas discussed how Celes&#x27; despair and hope during the second portion mirror the players&#x27; and how impactful her suicide attempt was years after witnessing it. Alana Hagues for &quot;RPGFan&quot; discussed how she saw herself in Celes due to going through similar trials and tribulations, particularly Celes losing her allies, the loss of a family member, and her attempted suicide. The relationship between her and Locke was praised as one of the most beautiful subtle romances in video games by Stew Shearer for &quot;The Escapist&quot;. She has been requested for inclusion in the &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; fighting game series as a playable character by staff of websites including &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Digitally Downloaded&quot;, the latter calling her their favorite character in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Her Amano-designed outfit was featured among the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; outfits by Maddy Myers for &quot;Paste Magazine&quot;, while Todd Harper for &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; preferred the Amano design over her in-game artwork. Chad Concelmo for &quot;Destructoid&quot; also praised her outfit, noting that the bright yellows in it work well with her fair skin.

Not all reactions to the character were positive. Writer James Labolokie from Nintendo felt that Celes relies too much on Cid and Locke to qualify as a character who breaks boundaries. Jef Rouner for the &quot;Houston Press&quot; was similarly critical of how she was depicted, noting that despite her and Terra&#x27;s importance and strength, they are frequently &quot;bound and dominated&quot; by men and require their aide. Patrick Holleman observed that much of her personality is implied in what she does not say and that the opera scene, which he described as one of the game&#x27;s &quot;cleverest&quot; due to its use of symbolism, gives players the only real insight into her character in the first half of the game. Holleman argued that she is not a brilliant or rounded character because she suffers from a lack of characterization, particularly in the first half of the game, and attributed the developers&#x27; decision to have players start with Celes in the World of Ruin to her lack of character and identity.

The book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Pierre Maugein offers an in-depth analysis of her character. In it, Celes is described as holding an important role in the story not only due to her direct connection to the Empire but also her role as a proud warrior and woman, further describing her as &quot;a battle-hardened character with an unwavering idea of her place, yet she never loses sight of who she is, regardless of the circumstances.&quot;. In addition, he stated that her past trauma made her fragile emotionally and that moments of weakness, aloofness, or desertion were always tied to someone close to her. While this made her seem unsociable in the first part of the game, he further noted her interactions with Locke as she realized she was not the only one who had to fight. Maugein states that while this may be seen as a stifling of her independence, it instead relates more to her love for Locke, despite her initial doubt that he may only see her as a way to right his inability to save a past loved one. This gives her a goal to fight for a world where she can be loved, and her mingling of &quot;humanism with a rational perspective&quot; gives her purpose as the foundation for the group and its setting, particularly in the World of Ruin.

Dr. Kathryn Hemmann, in an article for &quot;Kill Screen,&quot; described her as representing &quot;posthuman themes&quot; and &quot;optimism&quot; alongside Terra. She discussed how Celes&#x27; &quot;lithe and slender form, when juxtaposed against her sword and the geopolitical conflict,&quot; evokes the &quot;beautiful fighting girl&quot; archetype of late-20th century Japanese pop culture, whose &quot;female-coded compassion is often portrayed as the solution to an otherwise unwinnable war.&quot; Celes&#x27; magic was read by Hemmann as a form of posthumanism and &quot;otherness&quot;, an otherness that dissipates and becomes normalized when the rest of the cast develops the ability to do magic. She lastly added that &quot;Terra and Celes are not characters to be consumed, but identities to be embraced and managed&quot;, feeling they represented in many ways the discussions of bioethics prominent in the 1990s and that &quot;humanity, in all its forms, can bravely continue on into an optimistic future&quot;.

<text>James Gary Bechtel (born 1952) is an American cotton farmer and poker player, now based in Gilbert, Arizona. He is best known for winning the 1993 Main Event at the World Series of Poker (WSOP). At the time of his WSOP win, he lived in Coolidge, Arizona.

== Poker career ==

=== World Series of Poker ===
Bechtel began playing poker as a recreational player near his home in Arizona while working as a cotton farmer. He cashed for the first time in the World Series of Poker, coming close to winning a WSOP bracelet in 1979 when he finished runner-up to Perry Green in a $1,500 no limit Texas hold &#x27;em event.

Bechtel followed up this showing with several more final table appearances at the WSOP tournaments. Bechtel first cashed in the $10,000 No-Limit Hold&#x27;em Main Event in 1986, finishing in 11th place. He made the final table of the Main Event in 1988, finishing in 6th place in the tournament which
was won by Johnny Chan who earned his second consecutive world championship title. Bechtel earned $49,000 for his 6th-place finish.

At the 1993 WSOP Main Event, Bechtel reached the final table in second chip position with $631,000. He went on to eliminate the 1990 World Champion Mansour Matloubi and professional poker player John Bonetti. Bechtel then went on to defeat his final opponent, professional Glenn Cozen, who in the third hand of heads-up play raised all-in with a very short-stack of chips, Bechtel instantly called the bet, without first looking at his cards, which were while Cozen only held the , the five community cards dealt were and since neither player&#x27;s hand improved Bechtel won the title on the strength of the Jack-high alone. Bechtel earned the top prize of $1,000,000 and the WSOP bracelet, becoming the first amateur player to win the WSOP Main Event since Hal Fowler won the 1979 World Series of Poker Championship.

Bechtel also finished in the money of the Main Event in 1986 (11th), 1988 (6th), 1989 (31st), and 2001 (23rd).

Bechtel was also one of the players to make the final table of the inaugural $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event of the 2006 World Series of Poker, which was won by the late Chip Reese. The players at the final table for this event were one of the most accomplished groups of poker players ever to sit at a WSOP final table. The table included two world champions, Bechtel himself and Doyle Brunson, WSOP bracelet winners T. J. Cloutier, Phil Ivey, Dewey Tomko, Chip Reese, as well as established professionals David Singer who has since won a bracelet, Patrik Antonius, and Andy Bloch, who finished runner-up in the tournament. Bechtel was eliminated after his pocket sevens were beaten by Bloch&#x27;s pocket tens. Bechtel earned $549,120 for his fourth-place finish.

In 2009, Bechtel competed in the WSOP Champions Invitational tournament, open only to players who have won the $10,000 No Limit Hold&#x27;em Main Event at the World Series of Poker. The tournament drew 20 out of the 24 living former world champions, and the ten-handed final table was broadcast by ESPN. Bechtel finished fourth place in the tournament, which was won by 1983 World Champion Tom McEvoy.

In 2019, Bechtel won a No Limit 2-7 Lowball Draw for his first bracelet since his 1993 Main Event win. The 26 years between bracelet wins is the longest such span in WSOP history.

==== World Series of Poker bracelet ====
=== World Poker Tour ===
Bechtel has competed on the World Poker Tour and has cashed in four tournaments. His highest cash was 10th place in the season two Five Diamond World Poker Classic, held at the Bellagio. He earned $34,917.

His other three cashes were at the season two Bicycle Casino Legends of Poker (15th place, earning $15,450), the season three WPT World Championship (69th place, earning $30,000), and the season four L.

<text>The Honda CR-X del Sol (marketed in other markets as the Honda Civic del Sol, Honda del Sol and the Honda CRX) is a two-seater targa-top car manufactured by Honda from 1992 until 1998. Despite the body resemblance to a mid-engine car design, the del Sol is based on the front-engined Honda Civic platform and was the successor to the Honda CR-X.

The Spanish name &quot;del Sol&quot; translates to &quot;of the sun&quot;, and refers to the car&#x27;s opening roof. The del Sol featured a removable aluminum hardtop that stowed onto a hinged frame in the trunk and a motorized drop-down rear window. Manual and automatic &quot;TransTop&quot; roofs were available in select markets. It is the first open-air Honda sold in the United States.

Production and sales ended with the 1997 model in North America and 1998 elsewhere.

==Japanese and European markets==

The CR-X del Sol was first introduced to Japan and Europe in 1992 for the 1993 model year. The base model (called the VXi in Japan) came equipped with 13-inch steel wheels, available only at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; Japanese dealerships. The Japanese VXi/VGi versions came with a Honda D15B-VTEC 4-cylinder engine, an entry-level SOHC VTEC engine that produced .

The &quot;Si&quot; (called the &quot;ESi&quot; in Europe) model came standard with a 1.6-liter SOHC VTEC 16-valve 4-cylinder engine. The Si also came with 14-inch alloy wheels, which were offered in an optional body-color-matched paint scheme on Samba Green models, power side mirrors, cruise control, rear disc brakes, wider tires, and additional front &amp; rear anti-sway bars.

A premium model, VTi, was also available in Europe which came equipped with the same 1.6-liter DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine available in the North American del Sol VTEC.

The SiR models in Japan are powered by a 1.6-liter DOHC VTEC (B16A) 4-cylinder engine available with an optional limited-slip differential.

Depending on model and market, the options included a rear spoiler, custom floor mats, an automatic transmission, power steering, heated mirrors, front fog lights, traction control system (JDM only), limited-slip differential (JDM only), and air conditioning.

==North American market==
For the North American market, the car was marketed as a Civic del Sol upon its release for the 1993 model year.

During its initial year, trim levels were limited to the S and Si models powered by SOHC Honda D-series 4-cylinder engines. In 1994, the Civic del Sol VTEC model was added which included the 1.6-liter 16-valve DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing , stiffer suspension as well as larger front disc brakes and larger 14-inch tires. The S and Si models were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic while the del Sol VTEC model was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission.

In 1994, dual air bags became standard. Beginning in 1995, the car was marketed as the Honda del Sol (Civic being removed from the name). In 1996, the del Sol received a minor interior and exterior styling refresh and the S model got a 1.6-liter SOHC 4-cylinder engine replacing the 1.5-liter engine that came in the 93-95 models. 1997 was the final year of production for the del Sol in North America.

==Colors==
The 1993-1994 U.S. domestic market Del Sol came in five colors, namely Captiva blue pearl (color code B62P), frost white (code NH538), Granada black pearl (code NH503P), Milano red (code R81), and Samba green pearl (code GY15P). For 1995, Honda replaced Captiva blue pearl and Samba green pearl with isle green pearl (code G71P) and paradise blue-green pearl (code BG33P), and made frost white available on the Si. For 1996–1997, Honda removed the paradise blue-green pearl color, replaced isle green pearl with Cypress green pearl (code G82P), and added vogue silver metallic (NH583M).

==TransTop==
Most del Sols came equipped with a aluminum roof that could be manually removed and stowed onto a hinged frame in the trunk where it only took up of trunk space. An option available in Japan and Europe was the TransTop, an electric mechanism which retracted the targa top into the trunk via a push of a button. The roof is operated by flicking two catches above the windows, then holding down a button. The trunk lid raises vertically and two arms extend into the targa top. After locking the lid to the arms, the arms pull the targa into the trunk lid, which lowers back down with the roof inside. The open process is reversed for the closure and return of the targa top.

<text>Aramirè is music group from Salento, Italy, specializing in various forms of local traditional music:

* The &quot;pizzica&quot; version of the Tarantella,
* songs of the Grecìa Salentina region,
* traditional love songs,
* and polyphonic songs of love and labour.
The group was formed in 1996 by members of the defunct group Canzoniere di Terra d&#x27;Otranto, who in the late 1950s began studying and restoring local traditional music. Of the three founders, Luigi Chiriatti, Roberto Raheli and Sandro Girasoli, only Raheli remains in 2004, as a result of a divergence on the commercial drift of folk music. They gave an illustrious concert at Carnegie Hall in New York in January 2007.

<text>Wodziwob (died c. 1872) was a Paiute prophet and medicine man who is believed to have led the first Ghost Dance ceremonies, in what is now Nevada, sometime around 1869.

==Vision, prophecy, and dances==
In 1869, when living in the Walker Lake Valley of Nevada, Wodziwob had a series of visions while on a mountain.

The first vision proclaimed that &quot;within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake... [during which] the improvements of the whites-all their houses, their goods, stores, etc.-would remain, but the whites would be swallowed up, while the Indians would be saved and permitted to enjoy the earth and all the fullness thereof, including anything left by the wicked whites&quot;. The prediction of this selective earthquake was met with skepticism.

After a second trip to the mountain, Wodziwob received a new prophecy that stated that all peoples would be swallowed by the earthquakes, and after a few days the Native Americans would return to the world, now a paradise, while the whites would be destroyed. As the time period for the predicted earthquakes began to pass, many became disenchanted with Wodziwob&#x27;s prophecies.

This prompted him to make a third trip to the mountain, where it was revealed to him that those &quot;who believed in the prophecy would be resurrected and be happy, but those who did not believe in it would stay in the ground and be damned forever with the whites&quot;. An additional prophecy stating that a train carrying the dead would come from the east within four years is also attributed to Wodziwob (although this may have been a later addition by his disciple, Weneyuga). By the time of Wodziwob&#x27;s death around 1872, he had apparently removed the destruction of whites from his prophecy, replacing it with the idea that all were to be granted eternal life with no racial distinction being made.

Weneyuga would spread the prophecy of Wodziwob for several years after Wodziwob&#x27;s death, but after the failure of the train to restore the dead within four years, he essentially retired and became a respected medicine man until his death in the 1910s, with the majority of direct activities centered on Wodziwob&#x27;s message not surviving the 1870s.

One of his followers may have been Numu-tibo&#x27;o (also known as Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly identified as being the same man as Wodziwob. Numu-tibo&#x27;o was the father of Wovoka, who re-introduced his version of the Ghost Dance in 1890. It is Wovoka&#x27;s message and leadership that gained popularity, followers, and which is largely meant when modern people refer to &quot;the Ghost Dance&quot;.

<doc id="983366" wikidata="Q17004422" url="?curid=983366" title="Jesus freak">
<text>&quot;Jesus freak&quot; is a term arising from the late 1960s and early 1970s counterculture and is frequently used as a pejorative for those involved in the Jesus movement.

As Tom Wolfe illustrates in &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, the term &quot;freak&quot; with a preceding qualifier was a strictly neutral term and described any counterculture member with a specific interest in a given subject; hence &quot;acid freak&quot; and &quot;Jesus freak&quot;. The term &quot;freak&quot; was in common-enough currency that Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s failed bid for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, was as a member of the &quot;Freak Power&quot; party. However, many later members of the movement, those misunderstanding the countercultural roots, believed the term to be negative, and co-opted and embraced the term, and its usage broadened to describe a Christian subculture throughout the hippie and back-to-the-land movements that focused on universal love and pacifism, and relished the radical nature of Jesus&#x27; message. Jesus freaks often carried and distributed copies of the &quot;Good News for Modern Man&quot;, a 1966 translation of the New Testament written in modern English. In Australia, and other countries, the term &quot;Jesus freak&quot;, along with &quot;Bible basher&quot;, is still used in a derogatory manner. In Germany, there is a Christian youth culture, also called Jesus Freaks International, that claims to have its roots in the U.S. movement.

Contemporary Christian music group DC Talk released an album &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; in 1995, with its eponymous song being later covered by Newsboys, 4th Avenue Jones, and Owl City.

<doc id="983371" wikidata="Q215695" url="?curid=983371" title="Prekmurje">
<text>Prekmurje (; Prekmurje Slovene: &quot;Prèkmürsko&quot; or &quot;Prèkmüre&quot;; ) is a geographically, linguistically, culturally, and ethnically defined region of Slovenia, settled by Slovenes and a Hungarian minority, lying between the Mur River in Slovenia and the Rába Valley (the watershed of the Rába; ) in the westernmost part of Hungary. It maintains certain specific linguistic, cultural and religious features that differentiate it from other Slovenian traditional regions. It covers an area of and has a population of 78,000 people.

==Name==
It is named after the Mur River, which separates it from the rest of Slovenia. The name &quot;Prekmurje&quot; literally means &#x27;area beyond the Mur&#x27; (&quot;prek&quot; &#x27;beyond, on the other side&#x27; + &quot;Mura&quot; &#x27;Mur River&#x27; + &quot;je&quot;, a collective suffix). In Hungarian, the region is known as &quot;Muravidék&quot;, and in German as &quot;Übermurgebiet&quot;.

The name Prekmurje was introduced in the twentieth century, although it is derived from an older term. Before 1919, the Slovenian-inhabited lands of Vas County in the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary were known as the Slovene March or &quot;Vendic March&quot; (in Slovenian: &quot;Slovenska krajina&quot;, in Hungarian: &quot;Vendvidék&quot;). The part of modern Prekmurje that belonged to Zala County (the area between Lendava, Kobilje and Beltinci) was not considered to be a part of the Slovenian March. Until the early 19th century, this region of the Zala County belonged ecclesiastically to the Archdiocese of Zagreb and in the legal documents of the Archdiocese it was called as &quot;Transmurania&quot; or &quot;Prekmurje&quot;, that is the &quot;territory on the other side of the Mur River&quot;. After 1919, this name was reintroduced, now for administrative purposes, by the new Yugoslav administration. It, however, did not gain much popularity among the locals. The name &quot;Slovenian March&quot; was still used by the local inhabitants until the mid-1920s, but was gradually replaced by the term &quot;March of the Mur&quot; (Slovenian: &quot;Murska krajina&quot;). The current Hungarian name for Prekmurje, &quot;Muravidék&quot;, dates from the interwar period and is a translation of the Slovenian &quot;Murska krajina&quot;. From the mid-1930s onward, the name Prekmurje became widely used in the press and eventually became the most common name for the region. After World War II, this name replaced all previous designations.

Nowadays, the older term &quot;Vendvidék&quot; still exists in Hungarian, but it is used only for the small settlement area of Hungarian Slovenes between Szentgotthárd and the Slovenian border that remained part of Hungary after 1919.

==Geography==

The region is divided into three geographical subregions: the hilly area to the north of Murska Sobota, known as &quot;Goričko&quot; (literally, &#x27;the uplands&#x27;); the eastern flatlands along the Mur River, known as &quot;Ravensko&quot; (literally, &#x27;the flatlands&#x27;), and the western lowlands around Lendava, known as &quot;Dolinsko&quot; (literally, &#x27;the lowlands&#x27;). Northeast of Lendava, there is a small hilly sub-region, known as the Lendava Hills (&quot;Lendavske gorice&quot;).

The administrative and commercial seat of the region is the town of Murska Sobota. The only other major town is Lendava. Other significant rural centres are Beltinci, Turnišče, Dobrovnik, and Črenšovci.

==Population==
The majority of the inhabitants of the region are ethnic Slovenes. There are also sizable Hungarian and Romani minorities in the region.

In 1921, the total population of the area numbered 92,295, including 74,199 Slovene speakers, 14,065 Hungarian speakers, and 2,540 German speakers. Since then, the number of Hungarian speakers has been falling slowly but steadily. The German-speaking community, which used to be concentrated in three villages near the Austrian border and in Murska Sobota, was either expelled from the area or assimilated after World War II.

Since the early 1950s, Hungarian has had co-official status in the traditional settlement area of the Hungarian minority. Three municipalities are completely bilingual—Lendava (), Hodoš (), and Dobrovnik ()—and the two municipalities of Šalovci and Moravske Toplice are only partially bilingual. Two municipalities, Hodoš and Dobrovnik, have a Hungarian majority.

Prekmurje has traditionally been the most heterogeneous Slovene region regarding religious affiliation. Besides a Roman Catholic majority, there is a significant Protestant (mostly Lutheran) minority, concentrated in the hills of the &quot;Goričko&quot; region, which represents 20 to 25% of the population of Prekmurje. Three municipalities have a Lutheran majority (Puconci, Gornji Petrovci, and Hodoš), whereas in the Municipality of Moravske Toplice Lutherans comprise just under half of the population.

Before World War II, there used to be a significant Jewish community as well, mostly concentrated in the towns of Murska Sobota and Lendava (see also Lendava Synagogue). In the 1930s, two-thirds of all Slovenian Jews lived in Prekmurje. Most of them died in the Holocaust, and many of the survivors made aliyah after the war. There is also a significant Romani presence in the region, with Prekmurje being one of the two major settlement areas of Slovenian Romani (the other being Lower Carniola).

==History==


===Overview===
The region has had a turbulent history: it has been inhabited since the Stone Age, it was later included into the Roman Empire and subsequently into the Odoacer&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths, the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Kingdom of the Avars, the Slavic state of Samo, the Frankish Empire, the Principality of Lower Pannonia (9th century), and Arnulf&#x27;s Kingdom of Carantania (9th-10th century). In the late 10th century it was invaded by the Hungarians and was under administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century, when former territories of this kingdom were divided between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. Since then, Prekmurje was mostly under administration of the Habsburg Monarchy, with brief periods of Ottoman administration. Following the dissolution of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, the region was firstly included into the Hungarian Democratic Republic and subsequently into the Hungarian Soviet Republic. In 1919, it proclaimed independence as the short-lived Republic of Prekmurje and was subsequently included into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia). From 1941 to 1945, Prekmurje was temporarily occupied by the Axis Powers and in 1945 it was included into the new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1991, it is part of an independent Slovenia.

===Antiquity to Middle Ages===
During the Roman administration, the region was part of the province of Pannonia. Although, earlier Slavic settlements had existed in the area, the ancestors of modern Slovenes moved from eastern Alps and settled in Prekmurje after the Franks defeated the Avars during the reign of Charlemagne. In the 9th century, this area was part of the Slavic state known as the Principality of Lower Pannonia. The center of this state was in the city of Blatnograd near Lake Balaton. The principality was later dissolved and integrated in the Kingdom of Carantania established by the German Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia. This political entity in which all the ancestors of modern Slovenes were united under one ruler was soon destroyed by the Hungarian invaders who conquered the Pannonian plain and who incorporated Prekmurje into the Kingdom of Hungary. The area inhabited by Slovenes shrank to the present extent by the end of the 12th century and has remained stable since. In the 11th century, during Hungarian administration, the region was part of the Kolon county. Between the 11th century and 1526, it was divided between Vas County and Zala County. In the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, during the collapse of the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary, the region was part of the domain of semi-independent oligarch Henrik Kőszegi.

===Habsburg Royal Kingdom of Hungary ===

In 1526, the region of Prekmurje came under Habsburg administration, although some villages were under Ottoman administration during short periods between 1566 and 1688. During Habsburg administration in the 16th and 17th centuries, the region was part of the Captaincy between Lake Balaton and the Drava River within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. For a short time, Beltinci, under the name &quot;Balatin&quot;, became the sanjak center of the Ottoman Kanije Province. In 1687, Vas and Zala counties were restored: with a small interruption from 1849 to 1867, most of Prekmurje belonged to Vas County except for the Lendava district, which was part of Zala County until 1918.

===20th century===
After the end of World War I and dissolution of Habsburg Monarchy, there was briefly an independent Hungarian state and a short-lived Republic of Prekmurje that emerged in the midst of the chaos of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919. In 1918 the Catholic politicians and József Klekl aimed to create an autonomous entity or independent state, with the name &quot;Slovenska krajina.&quot; On August 12, 1919, Yugoslav troops took control of the region, and it was incorporated into the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). Between 1919 and 1922, the region belonged to Maribor county, between 1922 and 1929 to Maribor oblast, and between 1929 and 1941 to the Drava Banovina with Ljubljana as its capital. During World War II, it was occupied and annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary from 1941 to 1944 and by Nazi Germany between 1944 and 1945. Soviet troops took control of the area in May 1945. After the war it became part of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, which was one of the newly formed republics of Yugoslavia.

== Administrative divisions ==
Prekmurje is part of the Mura Statistical Region, also known as &quot;Pomurje&quot; or the Mura Region, which includes two historical regions: Prekmurje and the Prlekija sub-region.

Prekmurje is divided into 19 municipalities:

* Beltinci
* Cankova
* Črenšovci
* Dobrovnik
* Gornji Petrovci
* Grad
* Hodoš
* Kobilje
* Kuzma
* Lendava
* Moravske Toplice
* Murska Sobota
* Odranci
* Puconci
* Rogašovci
* Šalovci
* Tišina
* Turnišče
* Velika Polana

== Languages ==
The majority of the population of Prekmurje uses Slovene, either in its standard form or in the Prekmurje Slovene. Some of the local population speaks Hungarian or Romani. Before World War II, German was also present in the region, especially in some areas along the border with Austria. According to the Yugoslav census of 1931, just over 2% of the population of the region spoke German as their native language, and around 12% used Hungarian. After 1945, most of the German speakers either fled or were expelled, and the use of Hungarian has been in slow but constant decline since 1918.

Prekmurje Slovene served as the regional language of the Prekmurje region and of the Slovenes in Hungary for a long time. It a codified language form and has a literary corpus of around 500 works and several newspapers and magazines. After World War II, the use of written Prekmurje Slovene steeply declined, but it has never been entirely abandoned. Modern Prekmurje writers, poets, and journalists are continuing the literary tradition of the codified language.

It continued to be used by a broad range of people and, like other Slovene dialects, has retained its own special features that distinguish it from standard Slovene. Most Slovene speakers in the region, like elsewhere in Slovenia, thus live in a situation of diglossia. Although minority languages and the local dialect are still widely used in most spheres of private life, especially in rural areas, standard Slovene is used in education, media, and public life. In the 2020s, demands include recognition of Prekmurje Slovene in education, the media, literature, and politics.

Hungarian is used in some border areas, especially around Lendava. In the officially bilingual areas, Hungarian is recognized by the Slovenian government and is used as the second official language alongside Slovene. In these areas, all public signs are written in both languages, and primary and secondary education is bilingual.

Some of the Roma population in the region have retained Romani. Slovenia recognizes Romani as a minority language, but this official recognition has very few consequences in practice. The legal protection of Romani is much weaker than that for Hungarian.

== Cuisine ==
The region is known for its distinctive cuisine. Among traditional dishes, the best known are a pork, turnip, and millet casserole called &quot;bujta repa&quot; and a layered pastry called &quot;prekmurska gibanica&quot;.

<doc id="983374" wikidata="Q40621" url="?curid=983374" title="Ankylosaurus">
<text>Ankylosaurus is a genus of armored dinosaur. Its fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, about 68–66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was named by Barnum Brown in 1908; it is monotypic, containing only A. magniventris. The generic name means &quot;fused&quot; or &quot;bent lizard&quot;, and the specific name means &quot;great belly&quot;. A handful of specimens have been excavated to date, but a complete skeleton has not been discovered. Though other members of Ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is often considered the archetypal member of its group, despite having some unusual features.

Possibly the largest known ankylosaurid, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between . It was quadrupedal, with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward and down. Unlike other ankylosaurs, its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards the front. The front part of the jaws was covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name.

&quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is a member of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest relatives appear to be &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is thought to have been a slow-moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Specimens of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; have been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, Scollard, Frenchman, and Ferris formations, but it appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside &quot;Denversaurus&quot;, a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; may have inhabited upland areas. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; also lived alongside dinosaurs such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, and &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;.

==History of discovery==

In 1906, an American Museum of Natural History expedition led by American paleontologist Barnum Brown discovered the type specimen of &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot; (AMNH 5895) in the Hell Creek Formation, near Gilbert Creek, Montana. The specimen (found by collector Peter Kaisen) consisted of the upper part of a skull, two teeth, part of the shoulder girdle, cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, and more than thirty osteoderms (armor plates). Brown scientifically described the animal in 1908; the generic name is derived from the Greek words &#x27; (&#x27;bent&#x27; or &#x27;crooked&#x27;), referring to the medical term ankylosis, the stiffness produced by the fusion of bones in the skull and body, and &#x27; (&#x27;lizard&#x27;). The name can be translated as &quot;fused lizard&quot;, &quot;stiff lizard&quot;, or &quot;curved lizard&quot;. The type species name, &quot;magniventris,&quot; is derived from the (&#x27;great&#x27;) and (&#x27;belly&#x27;), referring to the great width of the animal&#x27;s body.

The skeletal reconstruction accompanying the 1908 description restored the missing parts in a fashion similar to &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal &quot;Glyptodon&quot;. In contrast to modern depictions, Brown&#x27;s stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, as well as a short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown&#x27;s reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown&#x27;s &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; description, the American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticized the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too few remains, and claimed that &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was merely a synonym of the genus &quot;Stegopelta&quot;, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related &quot;Polacanthus&quot; by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.

Brown had collected 77 osteoderms while excavating a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in his description of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; but thought they belonged to the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen as the now synonymous genus &quot;Dynamosaurus&quot; in 1905. More recent examination has shown them to be similar to those of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;; it seems that Brown had compared them with some &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; osteoderms, which had been erroneously cataloged as belonging to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; at the AMNH.
In 1910, another AMNH expedition led by Brown discovered an &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; specimen (AMNH 5214) in the Scollard Formation by the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. This specimen included a complete skull, mandibles, the first and only tail club known of this genus, as well as ribs, vertebrae, limb bones, and armor. In 1947 the American fossil collectors Charles M. Sternberg and T. Potter Chamney collected a skull and mandible (specimen CMN 8880, formerly NMC 8880), north of where the 1910 specimen was found. This is the largest-known &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; skull, but it is damaged in places. A section of caudal vertebrae (specimen CCM V03) was discovered in the 1960s in the Powder River drainage, Montana, part of the Hell Creek Formation. In addition to these five incomplete specimens, many other isolated osteoderms and teeth have been found.

In 1990, American paleontologist Walter P. Coombs pointed out that the teeth of two skulls assigned to &quot;A. magniventris&quot; differed from those of the holotype specimen in some details, and though he expressed a &quot;considerate temptation&quot; to name a new species of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; for these, he refrained from doing so, as the range of variation in the species was not completely documented. He also raised the possibility that the two teeth associated with the holotype specimen perhaps did not belong to it, as they were found in matrix within the nasal chambers. The American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter accepted the teeth as belonging to &quot;A. magniventris&quot; in 2004, and that all the specimens belonged to the same species, noting that the teeth of other ankylosaurs are highly variable.

Most of the known &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; specimens were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. In 2017 the Canadian paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Jordan Mallon redescribed the genus in light of newer ankylosaur discoveries, including elements of the holotype that had not been previously mentioned in the literature (such as parts of the skull and the cervical half-rings). They concluded that though &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is the best-known member of its group, it was bizarre in comparison to related ankylosaurs, and therefore not representative of the group. In spite of its familiarity, it is known from far fewer remains than its closest relatives.

==Description==

&quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was the largest-known ankylosaurine dinosaur and possibly the largest ankylosaurid. In 2004 Carpenter estimated that the individual with the largest-known skull (specimen CMN 8880), which is long and wide, was about long and had a hip height of about . The smallest-known skull (specimen AMNH 5214) is long and wide, and Carpenter estimated that it measured about long and about tall at the hips. The English paleontologist Roger B. J. Benson and colleagues estimated the weight for AMNH 5214 at in 2014.

In 2017, based on comparisons with more complete ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon estimated a length of for CMN 8880, and for AMNH 5214. Though the latter is the smallest specimen of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, its skull is still larger than those of any other ankylosaurins. A few other ankylosaurs reached about in length. Because the vertebrae of AMNH 5214 are not significantly larger than those of other ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon considered their upper range estimate of nearly for large &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; too long, and suggested a length of instead. Arbour and Mallon estimated a weight of for AMNH 5214, and tentatively estimated the weight of CMN 8880 at .

===Skull===

The three known &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; skulls differ in various details; this is thought to be the result of taphonomy (changes happening during decay and fossilization of the remains) and individual variation. The skull was low and triangular in shape, and wider than it was long; the back of the skull was broad and low. The skull had a broad beak on the premaxillae. The orbits (eye sockets) were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways because the skull tapered towards the front. The braincase was short and robust, as in other ankylosaurines. Crests above the orbits merged into the upper squamosal horns (their shape has been described as &quot;pyramidal&quot;), which pointed backwards to the sides from the back of the skull. The crest and horn were probably separate elements originally, as seen in the related &quot;Pinacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Below the upper horns, jugal horns were present, which pointed backward and down. The horns may have originally been osteoderms that fused to the skull. The scale-like cranial ornamentation on the surfaces of ankylosaurs skulls is called &quot;&quot;, and were the result of remodeling of the skull itself. This obliterated the sutures between skull elements, which is common for adult ankylosaurs. The caputegulum pattern of the skull was variable between specimens, though some details are shared. The caputegulae are named according to their position on the skull, and those of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; include a relatively large, hexagonal (or diamond-shaped) nasal caputegulum at the front of the snout between the nostrils, which had a loreal caputegulum on each side, an anterior and posterior supraorbital caputegulum above each orbit, and a ridge of nuchal caputegulae at the back of the skull.
The snout region of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was unique among ankylosaurs, and had undergone an &quot;extreme&quot; transformation compared to its relatives. The snout was arched and truncated at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical and were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front because the sinuses were expanded to the sides of the premaxilla bones, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae—strap-like, side osteoderms of the snout—completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils, giving a bulbous appearance. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities (or chambers) of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The nasal chambers had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils), and the air passage was looped. The maxillae expanded to the sides, giving the impression of a bulge, which may have been due to the sinuses inside. The maxillae had a ridge that may have been the attachment site for fleshy cheeks; the presence of cheeks in ornithischians is controversial, but some nodosaurs had armor plates that covered the cheek region, which may have been embedded in the flesh.

Specimen AMNH 5214 has 34–35 dental alveoli (tooth sockets) in the maxilla. The tooth rows in the maxillae of this specimen are about long. Each alveolus had a foramen (opening) near its side where a replacement tooth could be seen. Compared to other ankylosaurs, the mandible of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was low in proportion to its length, and, when seen from the side, the tooth row was almost straight instead of arched. The mandibles are completely preserved only in the smallest specimen (AMNH 5214) and are about long. The incomplete mandible of the largest specimen (CMN 8880) is the same length. AMNH 5214 has 35 dental alveoli in the left dentary bone () and 36 in the right, for a total of 71. The predentary bone of the tip of the mandibles has not yet been found. Like other ankylosaurs, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; had small, phylliform (leaf-shaped) teeth, which were compressed sideways. The teeth were mostly taller than they were wide, and were very small; their size in proportion to the skull meant that the jaws of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; could accommodate more teeth than other ankylosaurines. The teeth of the largest &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; skull are smaller than those of the smallest skull in the absolute sense. Some teeth from behind in the tooth row curved backwards, and tooth crowns were usually flatter on one side than the other. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; teeth are diagnostic and can be distinguished from the teeth of other ankylosaurids based on their smooth sides. The denticles were large, their number ranging from six to eight on the front part of the tooth, and five to seven behind.

===Postcranial skeleton===
The structure of much of the skeleton of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, including most of the pelvis, tail, and feet, is still unknown. It was quadrupedal, and its hind limbs were longer than its forelimbs. In the holotype specimen, the scapula (shoulder blade) measures long and was fused with the coracoid (a rectangular bone connected to the lower end of the scapula). It also had entheses (connective tissue) for various muscle attachments. The humerus (upper arm bone) of AMNH 5214 was short, very broad and about long. The femur (thigh bone), also from AMNH 5214, was long and very robust. While the feet of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; are incompletely known, the hindfeet probably had three toes, as is the case in advanced ankylosaurids.

The cervical vertebrae had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well-developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments, which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs of the last four back vertebrae were fused to the and (the structures that articulated the ribs with the vertebrae), and the ribcage was very broad in this part of the body. The caudal vertebrae had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides.

===Armor===
A prominent feature of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was its armor, consisting of knobs and plates of bone known as osteoderms, or scutes, embedded in the skin. These have not been found in articulation, so their exact placement on the body is unknown, though inferences can be made based on related animals, and various configurations have been proposed. The osteoderms ranged from in diameter to in length, and varied in shape. The osteoderms of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; were generally thin walled and hollowed on the underside. Compared to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, the osteoderms of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; were smoother. Many smaller osteoderms and ossicles probably occupied the space between the larger ones, as in other ankylosaurids. The osteoderms covering the body were very flat, though with a low keel at one margin. In contrast, the nodosaurid &quot;Edmontonia&quot; had high keels stretching from one margin to the other on the midline of its osteoderms. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; had some smaller osteoderms with a keel across the midline. 

Like other ankylosaurids, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; had (armor plates on the neck), but these are known only from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, creating an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered the base of the neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Arbour and the Canadian paleontologist Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter&#x27;s interpretation in 2015 and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of the holotype specimen did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around the upper part of the neck, as in the closely related &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Arbour and Mallon elaborated on this idea, describing the shape of these half-rings as &quot;continuous U-shaped yokes&quot; over the upper part of the neck, and suggested that &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; had six keeled osteoderms with oval bases on each half-ring.

The first osteoderms behind the second cervical half-ring would have been similar in shape to those in the first half-ring, and the osteoderms on the back probably decreased in diameter hindwards. The largest osteoderms were probably arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows across most of the body, with four or five transverse rows separated by creases in the skin. The osteoderms on the flanks would probably have had a more square outline than those on the back. There may have been four longitudinal rows of osteoderms on the flanks. Unlike some basal ankylosaurs and many nodosaurs, ankylosaurids do not appear to have had co-ossified pelvic shields above their hips. Some osteoderms without keels may have been placed above the hip region of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, as in &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; may have had three or four transverse rows of circular osteoderms over the pelvic region, which were smaller than those on the rest of the body, as in &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;. Smaller, triangular osteoderms may have been present on the sides of the pelvis. Flattened, pointed plates resemble those on the sides of the tail of &quot;Saichania&quot;, and may have been distributed similarly on &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;. Osteoderms with oval keels could have been placed on the upper side of the tail or the side of the limbs. Compressed, triangular osteoderms found with &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; specimens may have been placed on the sides of the pelvis or the tail. Ovoid, keeled, and teardrop-shaped osteoderms are known from &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, and may have been placed on the forelimbs, like those known from &quot;Pinacosaurus&quot;, but it is unknown whether the hindlimbs bore osteoderms. 
The tail club (or tail knob) of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was composed of two large osteoderms, with a row of small osteoderms at the midline, and two small osteoderms at the tip; these osteoderms obscured the last tail vertebra. As only the tail club of specimen AMNH 5214 is known, the range of variation between individuals is unknown. The tail club of AMNH 5214 is long, wide, and tall. The club of the largest specimen may have been wide. The tail club of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was semicircular when seen from above, similar to those of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; but unlike the pointed club osteoderms of &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; or the narrow, elongated club of &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot;. The last seven tail vertebrae formed the &quot;handle&quot; of the tail club. These vertebrae were in contact, with no cartilage between them, and were sometimes co-ossified, which made them immobile. Ossified tendons attached to the vertebrae in front of the tail club, and these features together helped strengthen it. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) and neural spines of the handle vertebrae were U-shaped when seen from above, whereas those of most other ankylosaurids are V-shaped, which may be due to the handle of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; being wider. The larger width may indicate that the tail of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was shorter in relation to its body length than those of other ankylosaurids, or that it had the same proportions but with a smaller club.

==Classification==
Brown considered &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; so distinct that he made it the type genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae, typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified &quot;Palaeoscincus&quot; (only known from teeth), and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) as part of the family. Due to the fragmentary condition of the remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;. Having for comparison only a few, incomplete members of the family, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923 Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria, thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.

Ankylosauria and Stegosauria are now grouped together within the clade Thyreophora. This group first appeared in the Sinemurian age, and survived for 135 million years until disappearing in the Maastrichtian. They were widespread and inhabited a broad range of environments. As more complete specimens and new genera have been discovered, theories about ankylosaurian interrelatedness have become more complex, and hypotheses have often changed between studies. In addition to Ankylosauridae, Ankylosauria has been divided into the families Nodosauridae, and sometimes Polacanthidae (these families lacked tail clubs). &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; is considered part of the subfamily Ankylosaurinae (members of which are called ankylosaurines) within Ankylosauridae. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; appears to be most closely related to &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie:

Because &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and other Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids were grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie suggested that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct by the late Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonized North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late Cretaceous, and there diversified again, leading to genera such as &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. The theory explains a 30-million-year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between the ages.

==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===
Like other ornithischians, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was herbivorous. Its wide muzzle was adapted for non-selective low-browse cropping, although not to the extent seen in some related genera, especially &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, they may have had a varied diet, including tough leaves and pulpy fruits. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; probably fed on abundant ferns and low-growing shrubs. Assuming it was endothermic, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; would have eaten of ferns per day, similar to the amount of dry vegetation a large elephant would consume. The requirements for nutrition could have been more effectively met if &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; ate fruit, which its small, cusp-like teeth and the shape of its beak seem well adapted for, compared to for example &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Certain invertebrates, which the small teeth may have been adapted for handling, could also have provided supplemental nutrition.

Fossils of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; teeth exhibit wear on the face of the crown rather than on the tip of the crown, as in nodosaurid ankylosaurs. In 1982 Carpenter ascribed to baby &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; two very small teeth that originate from the Lance and Hell Creek Formations and measure in length, respectively. The smaller tooth is heavily worn, leading Carpenter to suggest that ankylosaurids in general or at least the young did not swallow their food whole but employed some sort of chewing. Since adult &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; did little chewing of its food, it would have spent less time in the day foraging than an elephant. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, the digestion of unchewed food may have been facilitated by hindgut fermentation like in modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.
In 1969, paleontologist Georg Haas concluded that despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur lineages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;.

The retracted position of the nostrils of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; were compared to those of fossorial (digging) worm lizards and blind snakes by Arbour and Mallon in 2017, and though it was probably not a burrowing animal, the snout of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; may indicate earth-moving behavior. These factors, as well as the low rate of tooth formation in ankylosaurs compared to other ornithischians, indicate that &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; may have been omnivorous (eating both plant and animal matter). It may also (or alternatively) have dug in the ground for roots and tubers. A 2023 study by paleontologist Antonio Ballell and colleagues found that North American ankylosaurids from the latest Cretaceous (including &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;) had jaws with low mechanical advantage, whereas those of earlier relatives were high to moderate. These late ankylosaurids also had tooth occlusion and complex biphasal jaw mechanisms, features shared with some Late Cretaceous nodosaurids, but those instead have jaws with high mechanical advantage. This indicates that while the two groups converged in some features, the nodosaurs had higher relative bite force, which suggests diverging jaw mechanics and dietary partitioning between the two.

===Airspaces and senses===

In 1977, paleontologist Teresa Maryańska proposed that the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened the weight of the skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It has also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.

A 2011 study of the nasal passages of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; by paleontologist Tetsuto Miyashita and colleagues supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the idea of the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the elongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and the looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed the possibility that the looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactory region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.

According to Carpenter, the shape of the nasal chambers of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; indicate that airflow was unidirectional (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it may also have been bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, with air directed past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell. Though hindwards retraction of the nostrils is seen in aquatic animals and animals with a proboscis, it is unlikely either possibility applies to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, as the nostrils tend to be reduced or the premaxilla extended. In addition, though the widely separated nostrils may have allowed for stereo-olfaction (where each nostril senses smells from different directions), as has been proposed for the moose, little is known about this feature. The position of the orbits of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; suggest some stereoscopic vision.

===Limb movements===

Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb musculature made by Coombs in 1978 suggest that the forelimbs bore the majority of the animal&#x27;s weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary.

===Growth===
The squamosal horns of the largest &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; specimen are blunter than those of the smallest specimen, which is also the case in &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, and this may represent ontogenetic variation (related to growth development). Studies of specimens of &quot;Pinacosaurus&quot; of different ages found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative to the rest of the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical half-rings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim, with ossification gradually extending towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, ossification progressed from the neck backward in the direction of the tail.

===Defense===

The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in comparison to those of other ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. Structurally similar to Sharpey&#x27;s fibres, they were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering that was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.

The tail club of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; seems to have been an active defensive weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club would have been able to break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.
A 2009 study estimated that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally, and the mainly cancellous clubs would have had a lowered moment of inertia and been effective weapons. The study also found that while adult ankylosaurid tail clubs were capable of breaking bones, those of juveniles were not. Despite the feasibility of tail-swinging, the researchers could not determine whether ankylosaurids used their clubs for defense against potential predators, in intraspecific combat, or both. Other studies have found evidence of ankylosaurids using their tail clubs for intraspecific combat. One specimen of &quot;Tarchia&quot; showed signs of injury on both the pelvic and tail area and the club was found to be asymmetrical, a sign of being worn down by the strikes.

In 1993, Tony Thulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurids primarily acted as a decoy for the head, as he thought the tail too short and inflexible to have an effective reach; the &quot;dummy head&quot; would lure a predator close to the tail, where it could be struck. Carpenter has rejected this idea, as tail club shape is highly variable among ankylosaurids, even in the same genus.

==Paleoenvironment==
&quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; existed between 68 and 66 million years ago, in the final, or Maastrichtian, stage of the Late Cretaceous Period. It was among the last dinosaur genera that appeared before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens have been found in the Lance and Ferris Formations in Wyoming, the Scollard Formation in Alberta, and the Frenchman Formation in Saskatchewan, all of which date to the end of the Cretaceous.

Fossils of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; are rare in the sediments it is known from, and the distribution of its remains suggests that it was ecologically rare, or restricted to the uplands of the formations, where it would have been less likely to fossilize, rather than the coastal lowlands. Another ankylosaur, a nodosaur referred to as &quot;Edmontonia&quot; sp., is also found in the same formations, but according to Carpenter, the range of the two genera does not seem to have overlapped. Their remains have so far not been found in the same localities, and the nodosaur appears to have inhabited the lowlands. The narrower muzzle of the nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, further indicating ecological separation, whether their range overlapped or not.

With its low center of gravity, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; would have been unable to knock down trees like modern elephants do. It was also incapable of chewing bark and thus unlikely to have practiced bark stripping. As an adult, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; does not appear to have congregated in groups (though some ankylosaurs appear to have congregated when young). It is therefore improbable that &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; was able to modify the landscape of its ecosystem in the way elephants do; hadrosaurids may instead have had such an &quot;ecosystem engineer&quot; role.

The formations where &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; fossils have been found represent different sections of the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway dividing western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous, a broad coastal plain extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone, which have been attributed to floodplain environments. The regions where &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and other Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm subtropical/temperate climate, which was monsoonal, had occasional rainfall, tropical storms, and forest fires. In the Hell Creek Formation, many types of plants were supported, primarily angiosperms, with less common conifers, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by small trees. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; shared its environment with other dinosaurs that included the ceratopsids &quot;Triceratops&quot; and &quot;Torosaurus&quot;, the hypsilophodont &quot;Thescelosaurus&quot;, the hadrosaurid &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;, an indeterminate nodosaur, the pachycephalosaurian &quot;Pachycephalosaurus&quot;, and the theropods &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;, &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;, &quot;Pectinodon&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

==Cultural significance==
Carpenter noted in 2004 that &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best-known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City. Arbour and Mallon called &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; an &quot;iconic&quot; dinosaur in 2017, and noted that the World&#x27;s Fair sculpture, as well as the American artist Rudolph Zallinger&#x27;s 1947 mural &quot;The Age of Reptiles&quot; and other later popular depictions, showed &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; with a tail club, following the first discovery of the feature in 1910.

Many traditional popular depictions show &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurid ankylosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; itself. The armor of &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; has often been conflated with that of &quot;Edmontonia&quot; (earlier referred to as &quot;Palaeoscincus&quot;); in addition to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; being depicted with spikes, &quot;Edmontonia&quot; has also been depicted with an &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;-like tail club (a feature nodosaurids did not have), including in a mural by the American artist Charles R. Knight from 1930. &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; has been featured in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise, where they are depicted as attacking with their tails and running, abilities that have been criticized as unlikely by paleontologists.

<text>Herbert David Kelleher (March 12, 1931 – January 3, 2019) was an American billionaire airline businessman and lawyer. He was the co-founder, later CEO, and chairman emeritus of Southwest Airlines until his death in 2019.

==Early life==
Kelleher was born in Camden, New Jersey, on March 12, 1931, and raised in Audubon, New Jersey, where he graduated from Haddon Heights High School. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Wesleyan University where he was an Olin Scholar and where his major was English and his minor philosophy, and a Juris Doctor (cum laude) from New York University School of Law where he was a Root-Tilden Scholar.

==Career==
After clerking for a New Jersey Supreme Court justice, Kelleher moved to Texas intending to start a law firm or a business. He was a partner in Oppenheimer, Rosenberg, Kelleher &amp; Wheatley, 1969–1981. Kelleher and one of his law clients, Texas businessman Rollin King, created the concept with banker John Parker that later became Southwest Airlines. An often retold founding myth claimed the business plan was written out on a cocktail napkin in a San Antonio restaurant, though Kelleher and King have both stated that there was no literal cocktail napkin. They originally devised a very simple plan of connecting the Texas Triangle with low-cost air service, patterned largely on California&#x27;s Pacific Southwest Airlines. After incorporating the company initially as &quot;Air Southwest Co.&quot; in 1967, Kelleher and King faced four years of setbacks and legal challenges from competitors that culminated in winning key cases before the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1970 and the Supreme Court of Texas in June 1971. The first flights finally took off on June 18, 1971.

Reflecting back on that time Kelleher said, &quot;I think my greatest moment in business was when the first Southwest airplane arrived after four years of litigation and I walked up to it and I kissed that baby on the lips and I cried.&quot; Kelleher&#x27;s early involvement in the company was helping the company navigate legal concerns and as an advisor to the operation and later as general counsel. Lamar Muse was hired as CEO, but after struggles between Muse and King escalated over the next several years, Muse resigned in 1978. Kelleher was installed as chairman of the board in March of that year and the board appointed him as temporary CEO until hiring Howard Putnam as the new CEO and president. In 1981, after Putnam left to head Braniff Airways, he was appointed the full-time CEO and president, positions he held for 20 years.

Under Kelleher&#x27;s leadership, Southwest succeeded by a strategy of offering low fares to its passengers, eliminating unnecessary services, using a single aircraft type (the Boeing 737) (except for use of the Boeing 727 and use of MD-80 by TranStar and 717 by AirTran), avoiding the hub-and-spoke scheduling system used by other airlines in favor of building point-to-point traffic, and focusing on secondary airports such as Chicago-Midway (instead of Chicago-O&#x27;Hare), Dallas Love Field (instead of DFW), and Orange County, California but later some hub flights were operated at airports, such as ATL, LAS, PHX, DEN, STL, and BWI and some major airports, like ORD, LGA, LAX, SFO, and DEN. The company he founded and built has consistently been named among the most admired companies in America in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual poll. &quot;Fortune&quot; has also called him perhaps the best CEO in America.
Kelleher&#x27;s outrageous personality created a corporate culture which made Southwest employees well known for taking themselves lightly but their jobs seriously. His culture-leadership was well-demonstrated in an arm-wrestling event in March 1992. Shortly after Southwest started using the &quot;Just Plane Smart&quot; motto, Stevens Aviation, who had been using &quot;Plane Smart&quot; for their motto, threatened a trademark lawsuit, which was resolved between Kelleher and Stevens Aviation CEO Kurt Herwald in an arm-wrestling match, now known as &quot;Malice in Dallas&quot;. Kelleher lost the match, but was allowed to use the slogan in exchange for a $5,000 charitable donation and conceding Stevens&#x27; legal claim to the slogan.

In March 2001, Kelleher stepped down as CEO and president of Southwest. He passed the CEO role onto James Parker and the president role to Colleen Barrett, although he remained chairman. In July 2007, Southwest announced that Kelleher would step down as chairman and resign from the board of directors in May 2008. The retirement of Barrett as president was announced at the same time, though the two would remain full-time employees for another five years. Kelleher ultimately stepped down as chairman on May 21, 2008. Immediately following, Southwest Airlines filled both the chairman and president positions with then-current CEO Gary C. Kelly, who had taken over the CEO position from Parker three years earlier. Kelleher was given the title of chairman emeritus with an office at Southwest Airlines headquarters and he remained connected to the company until his death in 2019.

In July 2010, Kelleher was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas board of directors for 2011. Kelleher&#x27;s term expired in 2013. Previously, he had served as deputy chair.

==Awards==
Kelleher was the recipient of over 100 awards and honors in the worlds of business and aviation during his life. Some of the most notable include:
* Inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame, 1988.
* &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry, 1993.
*Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, 1996.
* &quot;Chief Executive&quot; named him CEO of the year for 1999.
* International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame inductee at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, 2002.
* Bower Award for Business Leadership, 2003.
* L. Welch Pogue Award for Lifetime Achievement in Aviation, 2005.
* Inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, 2008.
* The section of Cedar Springs Road in Dallas, Texas, leading to Love Field Airport was officially renamed Herb Kelleher Way in 2014.

==Personal life==
At Wesleyan he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On a blind date at a basketball game, he met Joan Negley who was a student at Connecticut College in New London. The two got married, and Joan was the person who introduced him to the state of Texas, which he also fell in love with, saying &quot;The greatest business decision I ever made ...was the move to Texas.&quot; They had four children, Julie, Michael, Ruth and David.

Kelleher was known for getting little sleep and for his affinity for Wild Turkey bourbon and cigarettes. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999, and underwent radiation therapy. He died on January 3, 2019, in Dallas at the age of 87.

<doc id="983381" wikidata="Q569615" url="?curid=983381" title="Anselm, Duke of Friuli">
<text>Anselm (died 805) was the Lombard duke of Friuli (749–751) and the founding abbot of the monastery of Nonantula.

==Life==
He left the world at the height of his secular career, and in 750 built a monastery at Fanano, a place given to him by Aistulf, King of the Lombards, who had married Anselm&#x27;s sister Gisaltruda. Two years later he built the monastery of Nonantula, a short distance northeast of Modena, which Aistulf endowed. Anselm went to Rome, where Pope Stephen III invested him with the habit of Saint Benedict, gave him some relics of Saint Sylvester and appointed him Abbot of Nonantula. Anselm founded many hospices where the poor and the sick were sheltered and cared for by monks. 

According to the twelfth-century &quot;Catalogus abbatum nonantulorum&quot;, a list of abbots of Nonantola with their histories, Desiderius, who succeeded Aistulf as King of the Lombards in 756, banished Anselm from Nonantula in favor of his own protégé. Anselm spent the seven years of his exile at the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, but returned to Nonantula after Desiderius was taken prisoner by Charlemagne in the war of 774. This exile is not mentioned the earlier &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot;, a biography of Anselm written one or two hundred years after his death.

Having been abbot for fifty years, Anselm died at Nonantula in 805, where the commune still honors him as patron. His feast day is 3 March.

<doc id="983392" wikidata="Q3504253" url="?curid=983392" title="Super Play">
<text>Super Play was a British Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) magazine which ran from 1 October 1992 to September 1996.

==Overview==
&quot;Super Play&quot; covered in great detail the role-playing video game genre. Many of these games were never released officially in the UK or European games market, and therefore the magazine concentrated much effort in covering aspects of the American, and moreover the Japanese games markets.

Given the close ties between the world of Japanese console RPGs and animation, the magazine also heavily featured information about manga and anime by noted UK-based writer Helen McCarthy. It can be said that Super Play was one of the magazines that helped to push forward what was at the time a nascent market for anime in the UK. In this vein, the magazine itself was also notable as its cover illustrations (and many illustrations between the covers) were done in manga-influenced style by artist Wil Overton. Overton also caricatured many of the staff in chibi form, wearing various types of anime-related costumes - sci-fi armour, flying gear, RPG-style armour etc. The cover even had the name &quot;Super Play&quot; written in katakana.

==Logo==
The logo for the magazine was designed by Jez Bridgeman in his first week on the magazine before the Art Editor arrived in the September before launch and at the last minute the &#x27;PLAY&#x27; part of the logo was switched for a sans serif font and then stretched to fit the space.

==Publication schedule and staff==
The magazine was published monthly, and would regularly feature a monthly Fantasy Quest column about Japanese console RPGs in their native market. In the second half of the publication&#x27;s life, there was a monthly Final Fantasy Forum dedicated to playing tips and secrets for Square games, even despite the fact that none of the Final Fantasy game series had been released in Europe at that point.

Some of the most recognisable names on the Super Play writing staff were Matt Bielby, Tony Mott (former editor of Future Publishing stablemate Edge), Jason Brookes, Jonathan Davies and Zy Nicholson.

The magazine was based in Bath, England and published by Future Publishing. Despite its fairly short run (47 issues, just short of 4 years, and a one-off &quot;Gold&quot; special in 1993), and many years since its demise, it still enjoys a fan following on the internet.

==Closure==
Its end came with the declining popularity of the SNES itself, both among games publishers and the game-buying public, as the Nintendo 64 was on the cusp of release, making way for the next generation of video game consoles. &quot;Super Play&quot; was succeeded in March 1997 by &quot;N64 Magazine&quot;, which was initially edited by Jonathan Davies with Wil Overton as Art Editor, and frequent contributions by former &quot;Super Play&quot; writers, although the magazine was much less focused on import gaming and RPGs than its forebear. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; in turn was renamed &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; to coincide with the launch of the GameCube, and after closure of &quot;NGC&quot; in 2006 the publication was relaunched as &quot;NGamer&quot;.

==Revival==
In September 2017, inspired by the announcement of a &quot;Super NES Classic Edition&quot;, original staff, including Jason Brookes, Jonathan Davies, Tony Mott and Zy Nicholson, along with seasoned Nintendo experts Nathan Brown, Keza MacDonald, Damien McFerran, Jeremy Parish and Chris Schilling, produced a one-off issue 48 of &quot;Super Play&quot;, which came bundled with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; issue 172. Featuring all-new content it consists of the regular sections Super Express, Helen McCarthy&#x27;s Anime World and a What Cart? guide. Also inside are new reviews of the games included on the &quot;SNES Classic&quot;, a &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; preview and an interview with Dylan Cuthbert, one of the key developers behind the game. Cover art was created by Wil Overton, illustrator of all 48 &quot;Super Play&quot; covers, with the internal visual style resurrected by Future&#x27;s senior art editor Warren Brown, who ensured the design will be immediately familiar to fans of the &#x27;90s magazine.

<doc id="983395" wikidata="Q268917" url="?curid=983395" title="Lee Aaron">
<text>Lee Aaron (born Karen Lynn Greening; July 21, 1962) is a Canadian rock singer. She had several hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, such as &quot;Metal Queen&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Do to My Body&quot;, and &quot;Sex with Love&quot;.

==Early life==
Aaron was born as Karen Lynn Greening in Belleville, Ontario, and began singing in school musicals at the age of five. She attended high school in Brampton, Ontario.

At age seventeen, Aaron was in a car accident. No surgery was required, but she did suffer a broken nose and badly bruised her face. However, years later &quot;Canadian Musician Magazine&quot; mistakenly embellished the incident into Aaron requiring complete facial reconstruction. The magazine printed a retraction in the following month&#x27;s issue.

==Career==
After singing in a music production when she was fifteen years old, she was asked to join a local rock group, which the members including Karen would name &quot;Lee Aaron&quot;. The members placed random names into a hat and drawn by the young musicians. She sang, played alto saxophone and keyboards in this first incarnation of the band, and took on the stage name of Lee Aaron.

===1980s===
Aaron recorded her debut album, &quot;The Lee Aaron Project&quot;, in 1982 on Freedom Records; it was later reissued on Attic. The album featured well-known musicians of the Toronto music scene, including members of Moxy, Rif Raf3 (Q107 Homegrown Vol 4 / Lee Aaron Project band), Santers, and Triumph&#x27;s Rik Emmett. Although the album was available in the UK only as an import, Aaron was invited to appear later that year at the Reading Festival.

In late 1982, Aaron flew to New York and posed topless for the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;OUI&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s March 1983 issue featured Aaron on the cover and in an interview. Aaron later concluded that posing for the magazine damaged her musical credibility; she regretted the decision and assigned blame for it to pressure from her manager.

1984&#x27;s recording of the album &quot;Metal Queen&quot; resulted in a multi-album deal with Attic Records. During the recording of &quot;Metal Queen&quot;, guitarist John Albani (ex-Wrabit) joined the band and he and Aaron formed a solid songwriting partnership that lasted eleven years.

Between 1984 and 1992, Aaron toured extensively through Europe and made appearances in Japan and the United States. She released six albums on Attic Records in Canada and international releases in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux, Italy, Scandinavia, Australia and Japan. She won three Toronto Music Awards for Best Female Vocalist and was nominated for Juno awards sixteen times. She amassed zero wins. Her 1985 album &quot;Call Of The Wild&quot; featured her well-known rock ballad &quot;Barely Holdin On&quot;.

Her most commercially successful album was &quot;Bodyrock&quot;, released in 1989. The album included several hit songs, including &quot;Whatcha Do to My Body&quot;, and was certified double platinum in Canada.

===1990s===
In 1992, Aaron left Attic Records to start her label, Hip Chic Music, and released two more albums. On 1994&#x27;s &quot;Emotional Rain&quot; (distributed by A &amp; M Canada), Aaron recorded with Don Short and Don Binns (Sons of Freedom), Reeves Gabrels (David Bowie&#x27;s Tin Machine), and Knox Chandler (the Psychedelic Furs).

1995&#x27;s &quot;2preciious&quot; was a project record written with members of Sons of Freedom, in which she dropped the name &quot;Lee Aaron&quot; entirely and used her real name, Karen. Neither of these recordings was commercially successful, and shortly afterwards, the Sons broke up.

Aaron studied acting for a year before beginning to perform jazz and blues in Toronto with Dennis Ziebart.

===2000s===

In 2000, Aaron released a jazz album, &quot;Slick Chick&quot;, on her imprint, Barking Dog Music, with distribution by Fusion 3. She performed extensively in support of this release, showcasing at The Top of the Senator in Toronto and various jazz festivals across Canada and Europe.

In 2002, Aaron was approached to audition with the Modern Baroque Opera Company. She was cast and appeared that year in an ALCAN Performing Arts Award-winning production called &quot;101 Songs for the Marquis De Sade&quot;.

Her eleventh album, &quot;Beautiful Things&quot;, a pop-jazz hybrid, was released in 2004.

Aaron continued to play rock and selected jazz shows; in 2011 she made her first appearance in Sweden at the Sweden Rock Festival.

In March, 2016, Lee Aaron released her first all-rock album in 20 years. Self-financed and released on her own Big Sister Records, the new album was entitled &quot;Fire And Gasoline&quot;. Later that year she was inducted into the Brampton Arts Walk Of Fame. She then went on to appear at the Rockingham 2016 melodic/hard rock festival in Nottingham, United Kingdom.

In 2017, Lee Aaron played a number of shows in Germany as well as an appearance at Bang Your Head Festivals and two separate gigs in London and Wolverhampton.

<doc id="983398" wikidata="Q725403" url="?curid=983398" title="Road Warrior Animal">
<text>Joseph Michael &quot;Joe&quot; Laurinaitis (September 12, 1960 – September 22, 2020), better known by his ring name Road Warrior Animal (or simply Animal), was an American professional wrestler. Along with Road Warrior Hawk, he was one-half of the tag team the Road Warriors (also known as the Legion of Doom). 

Over the course of his career, Animal appeared with professional wrestling promotions including Georgia Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association (AWA), All Japan Pro Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) / World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He held multiple championships, including the AWA World Tag Team Championship, NWA National Tag Team Championship, NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship, and WWF Tag Team Championship, and headlined multiple pay-per-view events, including competing for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at WCW Sin.

Animal was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2011, the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011, and the NWA Hall of Fame in 2012. The Road Warriors were named Tag Team of the Year by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; in 1984, and the number one tag team of the &quot;PWI years&quot; by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; in 2003.

==Early life==
Laurinaitis was born in Philadelphia on September 12, 1960. He is of Lithuanian ancestry. He grew up in Minnesota, having to work for a living from a very early age. He attended Irondale High School. Because of his size and love of power lifting, Laurinaitis was an imposing figure and thus a very effective bouncer. He worked as a bouncer at Grandma B&#x27;s in the Twin Cities where he caught the eye of Eddie Sharkey, a well-known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Laurinaitis and Mike Hegstrand, Richard Rood, and Barry Darsow could make it big in professional wrestling, and trained all four of them.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1982–1983)===
Laurinaitis made his debut in November 1982, competing as The Road Warrior using a biker gimmick. After only a few matches as a singles competitor, his career and life would change thanks to an idea by Paul Ellering.

===Georgia Championship Wrestling (1983–1984)===

When Paul Ellering was looking to put together a stable of heels in Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) called the &quot;Legion of Doom&quot;, it was decided to put Laurinaitis together with his good friend Mike Hegstrand and change their names to &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Hawk&quot; respectively. Thus, the Road Warriors were born. They first started out as biker gimmicks; on The Road Warriors DVD, Animal said he felt like one of the Village People. To look more intimidating, the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, spiked shoulder pads, and face paint. The look and name were taken from &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, helping to paint the two as no-mercy monsters. Their interview style was vicious, yet charismatic and a bit humorous. They wrestled their first match together in June 1983.

The team was an instant hit, revolutionizing the tag-team scene with their power moves, no mercy attitudes, and innovative face paint that would spawn many future imitators in wrestling. In Georgia, they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship four times.

===Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1983–1990)===
Their hard hitting style, no nonsense attitude, and winning ways made the Road Warriors fan favorites. Even when they were booked as heels, the fans refused to boo them. They started to split their time between the AWA and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) until finally leaving the AWA for big money contracts with the NWA and a huge push for the monster duo. The move paid off instantly as they won the inaugural Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament and feuded with the top stars of the NWA such as The Four Horsemen and The Russian Team (which included the Road Warriors&#x27; old training buddy Barry Darsow). During their initial run in the NWA, they helped popularize the WarGames match, the Scaffold match, and their trademark Chicago Street Fight.

In 1988, the Road Warriors engaged in a violent feud with The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) the first team that could truly match the Road Warriors in power (and who were one of the most well known Road Warrior clones). The Powers of Pain even went so far as to injure Animal&#x27;s eye, (kayfabe) as his eye injury actually occurred days earlier during a match, during a weightlifting competition. When Animal returned, he initially wore a hockey goalie mask to protect his eye. The angle abruptly ended when the Powers of Pain left the NWA after finding out they were booked against the Road Warriors in a series of Scaffold Matches and they did not want to get hurt by falling off the scaffold.

Near the end of 1988, the Road Warriors captured the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Midnight Express whom they mauled in short order to win the titles. After being the &quot;Uncrowned champions&quot; for a long time the Road Warriors&#x27; run with the tag team titles was short-lived. Teddy Long used a fast count to cheat the Road Warriors out of their titles. In their last year with the NWA, the Warriors feuded mainly with The Varsity Club, The Samoan Swat Team, and The Skyscrapers before leaving the NWA in the summer of 1990, due to conflicts with Jim Herd.

===American Wrestling Association (1984–1985)===
From 1984 to 1985, Animal wrestled for the American Wrestling Association.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1985–1989)===
From 1985 to 1989, Animal wrestled for All Japan Pro Wrestling.

===World Wrestling Federation (1990–1992)===
The Road Warriors signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1990 and were pushed into a feud with the most famous of all &quot;Road Warrior Clones&quot;, Demolition, a group which included their old training partner Barry Darsow. Due to the ailing health of one of Demolition (Ax) he was replaced by Crush, but the magic of the original Demolition was gone and the feud did not live up to the high hopes of the fans.

Just over a year after signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the WWF Tag Team Championship and held it for over five months. When they lost the titles, they briefly left the WWF, only to return with longtime manager Paul Ellering by their side, as well as a wooden ventriloquist dummy called &quot;Rocco&quot;. Both members of the L.O.D. thought the Rocco gimmick was stupid, and it led to Hegstrand walking out of the WWF immediately following SummerSlam 1992, leaving Laurinaitis on his own for the first time in nine years. Animal went ahead and finished his contractual obligations with the WWF, as a singles wrestler and occasionally teaming with former rival Crush, formerly of Demolition. During a handicap match in Japan against the Beverly Brothers in September 1992, Laurinaitis legitimately injured his back from a botched double suplex and had to take a lengthy hiatus. His last match was a victory over Papa Shango in San Francisco, California on October 16. After this his back was too injured to allow him to wrestle.

===World Championship Wrestling (1993, 1996)===
Laurinaitis made some non-wrestling appearances in WCW in 1993. On August 18, at the Clash of the Champions XXIV, Animal made his appearance, getting out of a black Camaro Z28 indicating his partner Hawk was Dustin Rhodes&#x27; mystery partner against Rick Rude and The Equalizer. On September 19, at Fall Brawl, Animal was the advisor for Sting&#x27;s team, consisting of Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster for WarGames, defeating Big Van Vader, Sid Vicious, and Harlem Heat.

For the next couple of years, Laurinaitis stayed out of the wrestling ring, collecting on an insurance policy from Lloyd&#x27;s of London while Hegstrand competed all over the world. Near the end of 1995, Laurinaitis&#x27; back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition. Three years after everyone thought the Road Warriors had ended, they reunited and signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling. On January 4, 1996, Animal seconded Hawk in his match against Scott Norton in New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s annual Tokyo Dome show. Upon their return in January 1996, they immediately started a feud with the Steiner Brothers, who returned in March, and Harlem Heat, before moving on to challenge the WCW Tag Team Champions Sting and Lex Luger. The Road Warriors had several shots at the champions but never won the title in the six months they were with the company. The Steiner Brothers also arrived shortly after the Warriors did, and feuded with them to try to prove who the best team of all time was. The Steiners got the better of the feud and the Warriors left WCW in June 1996.

===Return to WWF (1997–1999)===
After leaving WCW, they returned to the WWF where the Legion of Doom took part in the Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. the Hart Foundation feud, siding with Austin against the Harts. The Legion of Doom also became two-time tag team champions on October 7, 1997, when they defeated The Godwinns. In November 1997, the Legion of Doom faced the newly formed New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and lost the titles to the upstart team.

After several unsuccessful challenges, the L.O.D. were repackaged as &quot;Legion of Doom 2000&quot; with manager Sunny, although she did not stay with the team for long. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with D.O.A., whom L.O.D. were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the Road Warriors DVD that it was hard for Ellering to work with another team against the Road Warriors and difficult to rip on his former team on promos.

In 1998, the Legion of Doom became involved in their most controversial angle; playing off Hegstrand&#x27;s real life drug and alcohol problems. Hawk started to show up drunk or &quot;unable to perform&quot; on TV. As Hawk proved more and more erratic and unreliable, a third L.O.D. member, Puke, was introduced to team with Animal while Hawk dealt with his personal issues. The storyline ended with accusations that Puke had been the &quot;enabler&quot; of Hawk&#x27;s problems, exploiting them to take Hawk&#x27;s place in the team. During the controversial segment, Hawk was shown to have fallen off the Titan Tron. Neither Hegstrand nor Laurinaitis approved of the WWF exploiting Hegstrand&#x27;s personal problems, which caused them to subsequently leave the WWF.

While the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.

===Return to Japan, Australia and independent circuit (1999–2000)===
After his release from WWF, the Road Warriors wrestled at the AJPW Giant Baba Memorial Show defeating Jun Akiyama and Kenta Kobashi in Tokyo, Japan on May 2, 1999. In 2000, the Road Warriors worked for i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling in Australia feuding with The Public Enemy over the i-Generation Tag Titles. They also worked in the independent circuit.

Later that year, Animal wrestled for Battlearts in Japan as Animal Warrior teaming with Alexander Otsuka.

===Return to WCW (2001)===
In January 2001, Animal returned with a prominent position in WCW as the &quot;enforcer&quot; of the stable known as The Magnificent Seven with the objective to protect WCW World Champion Scott Steiner. He appeared on the main event of Sin for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Scott Steiner, Jeff Jarrett and Sid Vicious in a four corners match. Steiner retained the title. The Magnificent Seven split up shortly before Vince McMahon purchased WCW in March 2001; Animal&#x27;s contract was not one of the contracts the WWF picked up.

===Later career (2001–2008)===
After WCW folded, Animal reunited with Hawk at Jersey Championship Wrestling defeating the Moondogs 2000 in Lodi, New Jersey on September 8, 2001. The Road Warriors mainly continued working in the independent circuit.

In 2002, Animal once again returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling as Animal Warrior teaming with Keiji Muto. In 2003, The Road Warriors last stint was for Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling feuding with the Shane Twins.

After Hawk&#x27;s death, Animal returned to the ring nearly a year later focusing on his singles career. On May 11, 2008, Animal teamed with Power Warrior to defeat Damián 666 and El Terrible to win the UWA Tag titles for Toryumon Mexico Dragonmania III in Mexico City, Mexico. Animal would then retire from wrestling.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2003, 2007, 2016)===
The Road Warriors appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in late 2002 to early 2003 as part of a group that opposed Vince Russo&#x27;s faction Sports Entertainment Xtreme, but would only wrestle one actual match for the promotion.

On June 17, 2007, Road Warrior Animal returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the pay-per-view, Slammiversary, with Rick Steiner; he replaced Scott Steiner, who was out with an injury. They ended up losing to Team 3D.

On December 15, 2016, Animal returned to TNA for a guest appearance on the &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; special, &quot;Total Nonstop Deletion&quot;.

===Second return to WWE (2003, 2005–2006, 2011–2012)===
Animal and Hawk made a surprise appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; on May 12, 2003, when they took on Kane and Rob Van Dam for the World Tag Team Championship. This would be the last time the two would pair together as Hawk died later that year, on October 19, 2003.

Animal made a return to WWE on the July 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in 2005, where he was challenged by the then-WWE Tag Team Champions MNM to a title match at The Great American Bash. Finding a new tag team partner in Heidenreich, Animal went on to defeat MNM for the titles, dedicating the win to Hawk by saying, &quot;Hawk, this one was for you, brother!&quot; The two would team up for a few months in a new chapter of the Legion of Doom, with Heidenreich adopting the L.O.D.&#x27;s shoulder pads, face paint, and mohawk haircut. However, this came to an end with Heidenreich&#x27;s release from WWE on January 17, 2006.

On the March 3, 2006, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Animal teamed up with Matt Hardy to face MNM. After he and Hardy lost the match, Animal turned heel for the second time in his career by attacking and injuring Hardy&#x27;s knee. Animal reasoned that he had realized that Hardy and Heidenreich were screw-ups and that Road Warrior Hawk was the only tag team legend and partner for him. After the heel turn, Animal, once again known simply as &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, would drop many aspects of the well-known Road Warrior gimmick, losing the face paint, and shoulder pads. Animal&#x27;s look at this time was similar to his old Road Warrior gimmick in the early 1980s he had prior to teaming up with Hawk. On the March 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Animal lost to Hardy in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. Animal was defeated by United States Champion Chris Benoit on the March 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

In his final WWE match, Animal defeated Paul Burchill on the May 6, 2006, episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;. On June 26, 2006, Animal was released from his WWE contract.

WWE announced on March 28, 2011, on &quot;Raw&quot; that the Road Warriors would be inducted into the 2011 Hall of Fame. Animal also spoke openly about his future induction on Right After Wrestling just minutes after the announcement on &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. Animal told hosts, Arda Ocal and Jim Korderas that the WWE was going to create a physical Hall of Fame in Tampa and he was going to donate his trademarked &#x27;spiked-shoulder pads&#x27; to that Hall.

On the July 20, 2012, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on Syfy, Animal returned to face Heath Slater in honor of &quot;Raw&quot;″s 1,000th episode. He went on to squash Slater. He then reappeared on the actual 1,000th episode on July 23 with other WWE Legends to help Lita take down Slater, in what would be Animal&#x27;s final WWE appearance and the last match that he wrestled.

===All In (2018)===
On September 1, 2018, Animal made a surprise appearance at All In to open the event.

===SWE FURY (2020)===
On the June 12, 2020, episode of SWE Fury, a Plano, Texas–based nationally televised wrestling promotion, Teddy Long was named the new SWE General Manager alongside Road Warrior Animal, who served as his enforcer.

==Other media==
===Television===
==Writing==
Laurinaitis released an autobiography with William Andrew Wright titled &quot;The Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling&quot; on March 1, 2011, published by Medallion Press, Inc. The book talks about the rise of The Road Warriors, shares funny stories of life on the road, and offers behind-the-scenes accounts of professional wrestling.

==Personal life==
Laurinaitis and his ex-wife Julie, a former powerlifter and bodybuilder, had two children, son James (born 1986) and daughter Jessica (born 1989). Laurinaitis also had a son named Joseph (born 1981) from a previous marriage. He coached youth football for Wayzata, the school his son played for.

Laurinaitis&#x27;s brothers have both been involved in professional wrestling over the years. John Laurinaitis (Johnny Ace) is the former executive vice president of Talent Relations for World Wrestling Entertainment and a former wrestler. Marcus Laurinaitis is a former wrestler, mainly known as one half of the tag team &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (Terminator / Fury).

Laurinaitis and his tag team partner Hegstrand owned two gyms in Minneapolis in the late 80s. The pair, alongside gym employees Bob Truax and Dan Stock, conceptualized the Zubaz workout pants and helped popularize the brand globally. Laurinaitis owned 25% of the company until its closure in 1996.

Laurinaitis became a born again Christian in 2001.

Laurinaitis&#x27;s son, James Laurinaitis, played linebacker for Ohio State University. As a sophomore, James won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, given to the best defensive player in the country, and was a finalist for the Butkus Award, which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award. In fact, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; made a joke about borrowing his father&#x27;s shoulder pads and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the second round as the 35th overall pick in the 2009 NFL draft, and played with the Rams through the team&#x27;s final season in St. Louis in 2015, after which he moved to the New Orleans Saints.

In July 2016, Laurinaitis was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who had been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. An appeal was filed but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed it two weeks before Laurinaitis&#x27;s death.

===Death and legacy===
Laurinaitis died of a heart attack on September 22, 2020, ten days after his 60th birthday, at the Margaritaville Resort (formerly known as the Tan-Tar-A Resort) in Osage Beach, Missouri. WWE released a statement regarding his death. Former Road Warriors manager Paul Ellering along with numerous others also paid tribute. It was later confirmed that Laurinaitis died from a sudden heart attack shortly after his and his wife&#x27;s wedding anniversary celebrations. He had collapsed on the bed when he and his wife went back to their room.

<text>NGC 1 is an intermediate spiral galaxy of the morphological type Sbc, located in the constellation of Pegasus. It was discovered on 30 September 1861 by Heinrich d&#x27;Arrest.

== Observation history ==
Heinrich d&#x27;Arrest discovered NGC 1 on 30 Sep 1861 while testing the 11-inch f/17.5 Merz refractor of the Copenhagen Observatory. He missed nearby NGC 2. This was d&#x27;Arrest&#x27;s first deep sky discovery, though he was uncertain if his object was identical to h4 or h5 (both of which refer to NGC 16). His descriptions (combination of 4 observations) read &quot;faint, small, round, 20&quot;, no concentration. In a straight line connecting two stars 11 and 14 mag.&quot; Herman Schultz observed NGC 1 three times in 1866 and 1868 with a 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala and he also missed fainter NGC 2. The NGC 1 and 2 pair are not physically related. NGC 1 lies at a distance of ~200 million l.y. with NGC 2 at roughly 320 million l.y. 

The initial observers missed NGC 2, which is much fainter. NGC 1 appears to be quite close to NGC 2, in reality however, the two objects are far apart and unrelated. NGC 2 was first observed as a &quot;companion&quot; of NGC 1 by Lawrence Parsons.

== Properties ==

At an estimated 140,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 1 is roughly the same size as our galaxy, the Milky Way, which is believed to be approximately 160,000 light-years across. Although its apparent magnitude of 13.65 makes the galaxy appear too faint to see with the naked eye, its absolute magnitude of -22.08 makes NGC 1 two to three times more luminous than our home galaxy. The galaxy is 4.0 Mly away from the 80,000 light-years wide galaxy UGC 69, its nearest major neighbor.

NGC 1 has a visual size of 1.6&#x27; × 1.2&#x27;. Being classified as a SABbc class galaxy using the Hubble sequence and the De Vaucouleurs system as an extension, NGC 1 is a spiral galaxy with the presence of a weak nuclear bar and loosely wound arms. Although the central galaxy is only about 90,000 light-years across, a large, diffuse arm extends eastwards from it, possibly from a past merger.

Based on its redshift of approximately 0.015177 and thus recessional velocity of 4450 km/s, the distance of the galaxy from the Solar System can be calculated using Hubble&#x27;s law. Using current observation data, this places the galaxy at approximately 210 to 215 million light-years from Earth, which is in good agreement with redshift-independent distance estimates of 175 to 245 million light years. An opposing measurement of the galaxy&#x27;s recessional velocity of 2215 km/s would place the galaxy only about 100 million light-years away. However, this is regarded unlikely by most astronomers and believed to be a misattributed value for a different galaxy.

== Listing in astronomical catalogues ==
After being logged as the first object in the General Catalogue, the galaxy is also the first object to be listed in the catalogue&#x27;s successor, the New General Catalogue. With an original right ascension of at the time of the catalog&#x27;s compilation (epoch 1860), this object had the lowest right ascension of all the objects in the catalog, making it the first listing in the New General Catalogue as the objects were arranged by right ascension. Since then, the coordinates have shifted, and this object no longer has the lowest right ascension of all the NGC objects.

NGC 1 is also listed in the Uppsala General Catalogue (UGC 57) and in the Principal Galaxies Catalogue (PGC 564).

<text>NGC 2 is an intermediate spiral galaxy with the morphological type of Sab, located in the constellation of Pegasus. NGC 2 was discovered by Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse on 20 August 1873.&quot;

== Observational History ==
NGC 2 was first observed by Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse on 24 August 1873, and was described as &quot;very faint, small, south of GC 1.&quot;

== Properties ==

NGC 2 is located about 345 million light-years from the Solar System, with a magnitude of +14.2, while the distance to NGC 1 is 210 million light-years. Although visually close in the sky, NGC 1 and NGC 2 are at very different distances; were they stars, they would be referred to as an &quot;optical double&quot; as seen from Earth. 

AGC 102559, a spiral galaxy 60,000 light-years in diameter, is the closest galaxy to NGC 2, only 1.8 million light-years from it. Although it is quite close to NGC 1, the latter is closer and unrelated to NGC 2.

NGC 2 is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 60 thousand light-years, smaller than the size of the Milky Way.

== Listing in astronomical catalogues ==

NGC 2 is first cataloged as GC 6246, an addendum to Dreyer&#x27;s 1877 Supplement to the General Catalogue of Nebulae And Clusters of Stars. The object is cataloged as UGC 59, PGC 567, CGCG 478–027, and MCG +04-01-026.

<text>47 Tucanae or 47 Tuc (also designated as NGC 104 and Caldwell 106) is a globular cluster located in the constellation Tucana. It is about from Earth, and 120 light years in diameter. 47 Tuc can be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 4.1. It appears about 44 arcminutes across including its far outreaches. Due to its far southern location, 18° from the south celestial pole, it was not catalogued by European astronomers until the 1750s, when the cluster was first identified by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille from South Africa.

47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster after Omega Centauri, and telescopically reveals about ten thousand stars, many appearing within a small dense central core. The cluster may contain an intermediate-mass black hole.

==Early history==
The cluster was recorded in 1751-2 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille, who initially thought it was the nucleus of a bright comet. Lacaille then listed it as &quot;Lac I-1&quot;, the first object listed in his deep-sky catalogue. The number &quot;47&quot; was assigned in &quot;Allgemeine Beschreibung und Nachweisung der Gestirne nebst Verzeichniss&quot; (&quot;General description and verification of the stars and indexes&quot;), compiled by Johann Elert Bode and published in Berlin in 1801. Bode did not observe this cluster himself, but had reordered Lacaille&#x27;s catalogued stars by constellation in order of right ascension.

In the 19th century, Benjamin Apthorp Gould assigned the Greek letter ξ (Xi) to the cluster to designate it ξ Tucanae, but this was not widely adopted and it is almost universally referred to as 47 Tucanae.

==Characteristics==
47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky (after Omega Centauri), and is noted for having a small very bright and dense core. It is one of the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy, containing millions of stars. The cluster appears roughly the size of the full moon in the sky under ideal conditions. Though it appears adjacent to the Small Magellanic Cloud, the latter is some distant, being over fifteen times farther than 47 Tuc.

A blue giant star with a spectral class of B8III is the brightest star in visible and ultraviolet light, with a luminosity of about 1,100 times that of the Sun, and is aptly known as the &quot;Bright Star&quot;. It is a post-AGB star, having passed the asymptotic giant branch phase of its life, and is currently fusing helium. It has an effective temperature of about 10,850 K, and is about 54% the mass of the Sun.

The core of 47 Tuc was the subject of a major survey for planets, using the Hubble Space Telescope to look for partial eclipses of stars by their planets. No planets were found, though ten to fifteen were expected based on the rate of planet discoveries around stars near the Sun. This indicates that planets are relatively rare in globular clusters. A later ground-based survey in the uncrowded outer regions of the cluster also failed to detect planets when several were expected. This strongly indicates that the low metallicity of the environment, rather than the crowding, is responsible.

47 Tucanae contains at least two stellar populations of stars, of different ages or metallicities. The dense core contains a number of exotic stars of scientific interest, including at least 21 blue stragglers. Globular clusters efficiently sort stars by mass, with the most massive stars falling to the center.

47 Tucanae contains hundreds of X-ray sources, including stars with enhanced chromospheric activity due to their presence in binary star systems, cataclysmic variable stars containing white dwarfs accreting from companion stars and low-mass X-ray binaries containing neutron stars that are not currently accreting, but can be observed by the X-rays emitted from the hot surface of the neutron star.
47 Tucanae has 35 known millisecond pulsars, the second largest population of pulsars in any globular cluster, after Terzan 5.
These pulsars are thought to be spun up by the accretion of material from binary companion stars, in a previous X-ray binary phase. The companion of one pulsar in 47 Tucanae, 47 Tuc W, seems to still be transferring mass towards its companion, indicating that this system is completing a transition from being an accreting low-mass X-ray binary to a millisecond pulsar. X-ray emission has been individually detected from most millisecond pulsars in 47 Tucanae with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, likely emission from the neutron star surface, and gamma-ray emission has been detected with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope from its millisecond pulsar population (making 47 Tucanae the first globular cluster to be detected in gamma-rays).

=== Possible central black hole ===
It is not yet clear whether 47 Tucanae hosts a central black hole. Hubble Space Telescope data constrain the mass of any possible black hole at the cluster&#x27;s center to be less than approximately 1,500 solar masses. However, in February, 2017, astronomers announced that a black hole of some 2,200 solar masses may be located in the cluster; the researchers detected the black hole&#x27;s signature from the motions and distributions of pulsars in the cluster. Despite this, a recent analysis of an updated and more extensive timing data set on these pulsars provides no solid evidence in favor of the existence of a black hole.

==Modern discoveries==
In December 2008, Ragbir Bhathal of the University of Western Sydney claimed the detection of a strong laser-like signal from the direction of 47 Tucanae.

In May 2015, the first evidence of the process of mass segregation in this globular cluster was announced. The cluster&#x27;s Hertzsprung–Russell diagram suggests stars approximately 13 billion years old, which is unusually old.

<doc id="983431" wikidata="Q937804" url="?curid=983431" title="Embusen">
<text>is a Japanese term used in martial arts like karate and judo to refer to the spot where a &quot;kata&quot; begins, as well as its line of movement. Though it is not stressed in Okinawa, nearly all Japanese-influenced &quot;kata&quot; start and end on exactly the same &quot;embusen&quot; point (Kiten). This word is also commonly romanized as &quot;enbusen&quot;.

The &quot;embusen&quot; line varies for each series of &quot;kata&quot;. It is always perpendicular to the battle line of an engagement and is the line one travels back and forth in battle. So it is, for example, a straight line for the Shōtōkan &quot;Tekki&quot; series of &quot;kata&quot;. It follows the form of a capital letter &quot;I&quot; for the &quot;Heian&quot; series of &quot;kata&quot;, as well as for the &quot;Taikyoku&quot; series. More advanced &quot;kata&quot;, such as Shotokan&#x27;s &quot;Kanku-Dai&quot; and &quot;Gojūshiho Dai and Sho kata&quot;, as well as the Gōjū-ryū &quot;Seipai and Kururumfa kata&quot;, for example, have increasingly more complex &quot;embusen&quot; to train the practitioner in more advanced defensive angles and footwork. For any &quot;kata&quot;, the &quot;embusen&quot; is fixed and must be followed exactly for proper mastery of the style.

== The rule of embusen ==
Japanese Kata are mostly arranged to start and end on or around the same point. Many were modified from their original Okinawan versions to accomplish this feat. The purpose of this is simply to allow the movements to be practiced in a small training space. The rule of embusen is that any movements in one direction should be symmetrical and countered by an equivalent number of movements in the opposite direction. In Okinawan karate the maximum number of steps in any direction is normally three.

<text>Descartes&#x27; Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain is a 1994 book by neuroscientist António Damásio describing the physiology of rational thought and decision, and how the faculties could have evolved through Darwinian natural selection. Damásio refers to René Descartes&#x27; separation of the mind from the body (the mind/body dualism) as an error because reasoning requires the guidance of emotions and feelings conveyed from the body. Written for the layperson, Damásio uses the dramatic 1848 railroad accident case of Phineas Gage as a reference for incorporating data from multiple modern clinical cases, enumerating damaging cognitive effects when feelings and reasoning become anatomically decoupled. The book provides an analysis of diverse clinical data contrasting a wide range of emotional changes following frontal lobe damage as well as lower (medulla) and anterior areas of the brain such as the anterior cingulate. Among his experimental evidence and testable hypotheses, Damásio presents the &quot;somatic marker hypothesis&quot;, a proposed mechanism by which emotions guide (or bias) behavior and decision-making, and positing that rationality requires emotional input. He argues that René Descartes&#x27; &quot;error&quot; was the dualist separation of mind and body, rationality and emotion.

<text>NGC 457 (also designated Caldwell 13, and known as the Dragonfly Cluster, E.T. Cluster, Owl Cluster, Kachina Doll Cluster or Phi Cassiopeiae Cluster) is an open star cluster in the constellation Cassiopeia. 

== Discovery ==
It was discovered by William Herschel on August 18, 1780, with a 6.2 inch reflector telescope, and catalogued as VII 42.

== Visibility ==
It is an easy target for amateur astronomers, and can be seen even with small telescopes in light-polluted skies.

== Characteristics ==
It lies over 7,900 light years away from the Sun. It has an estimated age of 21 million years. The cluster is sometimes referred by amateur astronomers as the &quot;Owl Cluster&quot; or the &quot;E.T. Cluster&quot; (due to its resemblance to the movie character).
Two bright stars Phi Cassiopeiae (magnitude 5 and spectral type F0) and HD 7902 (magnitude 7) can be imagined as eyes. It is not yet clear if Phi Cassiopeiae is a member of the cluster, and if it is, then it would be one of the brightest stars known, surpassing Rigel in luminosity. For comparison, the Sun at the same distance as Phi Cassiopeiae would shine at just 17.3 magnitude. The next brightest star is the red supergiant variable star V466 Cassiopeiae. The cluster features a rich field of about 150 stars of magnitude 9-13. About 60 stars have been identified as true members of the cluster.

<text>NGC 752 (also known as Caldwell 28) is an open cluster in the constellation Andromeda. The cluster was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783 and cataloged by her brother William Herschel in 1786, although an object that may have been NGC 752 was described by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654.

The large cluster lies 1,400 light-years away from the Earth and is easily seen through binoculars, although it may approach naked eye visibility under good observing conditions. A telescope reveals about 60 stars no brighter than 9th magnitude within NGC 752.

==Components==
The most up-to-date research lists 302 stars as members of NGC 752. Since the age of the cluster is , they are mainly low mass stars on the main sequence or red giants, with a main sequence turnoff at about F0. A blue straggler star is also present, along with some spectroscopic binaries and variable stars. The detached eclipsing binary DS Andromedae is a member of this cluster.

<text>Charles Collingwood (June 4, 1917 – October 3, 1985) was an American journalist and war correspondent. He was an early member of Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s group of foreign correspondents that was known as the &quot;Murrow Boys&quot;. During World War II, he covered Europe and North Africa for CBS News. Collingwood was also among the early ranks of television journalists who included Walter Cronkite, Eric Sevareid, and Murrow himself.

==Early life==
Collingwood was born in Three Rivers, Michigan. He attended Deep Springs College and graduated from Cornell University. In 1939, he received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University.

==World War II==

Collingwood covered World War II for United Press in London and was soon recruited to CBS by Edward R. Murrow in 1941. He established himself as an urbane and spontaneously-eloquent on-air journalist.

In 1942, Collingwood was sent to cover the North African Campaign, where he proved his reporting abilities despite being considered &quot;green&quot; as a broadcast journalist.

On D-Day, he landed at Utah Beach hours after the first wave of soldiers had hit the beaches. Of the CBS reporters accompanying the ground invasion, he recorded a report on June 6 that made it to broadcast two days later. The other CBS correspondents on the ground, Bill Downs and Larry LeSueur, were not able to deliver reports until days later because of trouble setting up mobile transmitters.

When General Omar Bradley told Collingwood that the French Resistance was about to rise up and liberate Paris, Collingwood prepared and sent a recording with news of the liberation to CBS in London so that it would be ready when the city was actually freed. The recording bore a label that said to hold it back until Paris was actually liberated, but the technician at CBS did not read the label and immediately aired the recording. On that day, August 22, there were still thousands of German troops in Paris, and the Resistance fighters who were fighting and dying did not appreciate that the world was told that Paris had been liberated. The city was not actually liberated until three days later, on August 25.

==Later career==
After the war, Collingwood remained with CBS and established himself as a television journalist. One of his first roles on television was as host of the CBS documentary series &quot;Adventure&quot;, which was produced in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History. He went on to become the chief correspondent of CBS and host of its &quot;Eyewitness to History&quot; series. In 1959 he succeeded Edward R. Murrow as host of &quot;Person to Person&quot;. He was a leading figure in CBS&#x27;s expansion to include international coverage, and was CBS News&#x27;s first United Nations correspondent. He later served as the network&#x27;s White House correspondent.

Collingwood accompanied then-First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy on a televised tour of the White House which she had renovated during the first year of the presidency of her husband, United States President John F. Kennedy. The resulting program, &quot;A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy&quot;, was broadcast on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1962 and was seen by 80 million viewers and broadcast in 50 countries, including Russia and China.

He served as substitute anchor during portions of CBS&#x27;s coverage of the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963, relieving Walter Cronkite only minutes after Cronkite had announced the official confirmation of Kennedy&#x27;s death.

Collingwood was CBS&#x27;s chief foreign correspondent from 1964 to 1975, covering warfare in Southeast Asia. In 1968, he became the first US reporter allowed into North Vietnam. The inspiration for Collingwood&#x27;s 1970 espionage novel &quot;The Defector&quot; largely came from this visit. The book received critical praise for its merits as a thriller and for its insights into the complexities of the Vietnam War.
