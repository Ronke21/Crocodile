<text>In mathematics, the Selberg trace formula, introduced by , is an expression for the character of the unitary representation of a Lie group on the space of square-integrable functions, where is a cofinite discrete group. The character is given by the trace of certain functions on .

The simplest case is when is cocompact, when the representation breaks up into discrete summands. Here the trace formula is an extension of the Frobenius formula for the character of an induced representation of finite groups. When is the cocompact subgroup of the real numbers , the Selberg trace formula is essentially the Poisson summation formula.

The case when is not compact is harder, because there is a continuous spectrum, described using Eisenstein series. Selberg worked out the non-compact case when is the group ; the extension to higher rank groups is the Arthur–Selberg trace formula.

When is the fundamental group of a Riemann surface, the Selberg trace formula describes the spectrum of differential operators such as the Laplacian in terms of geometric data involving the lengths of geodesics on the Riemann surface. In this case the Selberg trace formula is formally similar to the explicit formulas relating the zeros of the Riemann zeta function to prime numbers, with the zeta zeros corresponding to eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and the primes corresponding to geodesics. Motivated by the analogy, Selberg introduced the Selberg zeta function of a Riemann surface, whose analytic properties are encoded by the Selberg trace formula.

==Early history==
Cases of particular interest include those for which the space is a compact Riemann surface . The initial publication in 1956 of Atle Selberg dealt with this case, its Laplacian differential operator and its powers. The traces of powers of a Laplacian can be used to define the Selberg zeta function. The interest of this case was the analogy between the formula obtained, and the explicit formulae of prime number theory. Here the closed geodesics on play the role of prime numbers.

At the same time, interest in the traces of Hecke operators was linked to the Eichler–Selberg trace formula, of Selberg and Martin Eichler, for a Hecke operator acting on a vector space of cusp forms of a given weight, for a given congruence subgroup of the modular group. Here the trace of the identity operator is the dimension of the vector space, i.e. the dimension of the space of modular forms of a given type: a quantity traditionally calculated by means of the Riemann–Roch theorem.

==Applications==
The trace formula has applications to arithmetic geometry and number theory. For instance, using the trace theorem, Eichler and Shimura calculated the Hasse–Weil L-functions associated to modular curves; Goro Shimura&#x27;s methods by-passed the analysis involved in the trace formula. The development of parabolic cohomology (from Eichler cohomology) provided a purely algebraic setting based on group cohomology, taking account of the cusps characteristic of non-compact Riemann surfaces and modular curves.

The trace formula also has purely differential-geometric applications. For instance, by a result of Buser, the length spectrum of a Riemann surface is an isospectral invariant, essentially by the trace formula.

==Selberg trace formula for compact hyperbolic surfaces==
A compact hyperbolic surface can be written as the space of orbits formula_1 where is a subgroup of , and is the upper half plane, and acts on by linear fractional transformations.

The Selberg trace formula for this case is easier than the general case because the surface is compact so there is no continuous spectrum, and the group has no parabolic or elliptic elements (other than the identity).

Then the spectrum for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on is discrete and real, since the Laplace operator is self adjoint with compact resolvent; that is
formula_2
where the eigenvalues correspond to -invariant eigenfunctions in of the Laplacian; in other words
formula_3

Using the variable substitution
formula_4
the eigenvalues are labeled
formula_5

Then the Selberg trace formula is given by
formula_6

The right hand side is a sum over conjugacy classes of the group , with the first term corresponding to the identity element and the remaining terms forming a sum over the other conjugacy classes (which are all hyperbolic in this case). The function has to satisfy the following:

* be analytic on ; 
* there exist positive constants and such that: formula_7

The function is the Fourier transform of , that is,
formula_8

==The general Selberg trace formula for cocompact quotients==
===General statement===
Let &quot;G&quot; be a unimodular locally compact group, and formula_9 a discrete cocompact subgroup of &quot;G&quot; and formula_10 a compactly supported continuous function on &quot;G&quot;. The trace formula in this setting is the following equality: 
formula_11
where formula_12 is the set of conjugacy classes in formula_9, formula_14 is the unitary dual of &quot;G&quot; and:
* for an element formula_15, formula_16 with formula_17 the centralisers of formula_18 in formula_19 respectively; 
* for an irreducible unitary representation formula_20 of formula_21, formula_22 is the multiplicity of formula_20 in the right-representation on formula_24 in formula_25), and formula_26 is the operator formula_27; 
* all integrals and volumes are taken with respect to the Haar measure on formula_21 or its quotients. 

The left-hand side of the formula is called the &quot;geometric side&quot; and the right-hand side the &quot;spectral side&quot;. The terms formula_29 are orbital integrals. 

===Proof===
Define the following operator on compactly supported functions on formula_24: 
formula_31
It extends continuously to formula_32 and for formula_33 we have:
formula_34
after a change of variables. Assuming formula_35 is compact, the operator formula_36 is trace-class and the trace formula is the result of computing its trace in two ways as explained below.

The trace of formula_36can be expressed as the integral of the kernel formula_38 along the diagonal, that is:
formula_39
Let formula_12 denote a collection of representatives of conjugacy classes in formula_9, and formula_42 and formula_43 the respective centralizers of formula_18. 
Then the above integral can, after manipulation, be written
formula_45
This gives the &quot;geometric side&quot; of the trace formula.

The &quot;spectral side&quot; of the trace formula comes from computing the trace of formula_36 using the decomposition of the regular representation of formula_21 into its irreducible components. Thus
formula_48
where formula_49 is the set of irreducible unitary representations of formula_21 (recall that the positive integer formula_22 is the multiplicity of formula_20 in the unitary representation formula_53 on formula_32). 

===The case of semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces===
When formula_21 is a semisimple Lie group with a maximal compact subgroup formula_56 and formula_57 is the associated symmetric space the conjugacy classes in formula_9 can be described in geometric terms using the compact Riemannian manifold (more generally orbifold) formula_59. The orbital integrals and the traces in irreducible summands can then be computed further and in particular one can recover the case of the trace formula for hyperbolic surfaces in this way.

==Later work==
The general theory of Eisenstein series was largely motivated by the requirement to separate out the continuous spectrum, which is characteristic of the non-compact case.

The trace formula is often given for algebraic groups over the adeles rather than for Lie groups, because this makes the corresponding discrete subgroup into an algebraic group over a field which is technically easier to work with. The case of SL2(C) is discussed in and . Gel&#x27;fand et al also treat SL2() where is a locally compact topological field with ultrametric norm, so a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Q&quot;p&quot; or of the formal Laurent series F&quot;q&quot;((&quot;T&quot;)); they also handle the adelic case in characteristic 0, combining all completions R and Q&quot;p&quot; of the rational numbers Q.

Contemporary successors of the theory are the Arthur–Selberg trace formula applying to the case of general semisimple &quot;G&quot;, and the many studies of the trace formula in the Langlands philosophy (dealing with technical issues such as endoscopy). The Selberg trace formula can be derived from the Arthur–Selberg trace formula with some effort.

<text>Lazarus Colloredo and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617 – after 1646) were Italian conjoined twins who toured freak shows in 17th-century Europe. They were born in Genoa, Italy.

==Physical condition==

The upper body and left leg of Joannes Baptista (named after John the Baptist) stuck out of his mobile brother, Lazarus. He did not speak, kept his eyes closed and mouth open all the time, and was a parasitic twin. According to a later account by Copenhagen anatomist Thomas Bartholinus, if someone pushed the breast of Joannes Baptista, he moved his hands, ears, and lips.

The brothers&#x27; exact date of death is unknown. They are last mentioned c. 1646.

==Entertainment career==

To make a living, Lazarus toured around Europe and visited at least Basel, Switzerland, and Copenhagen, Denmark, before he arrived in Scotland in 1642 and later visited the court of Charles I of England.

He also visited Danzig (Gdańsk), the Ottoman Empire, and toured Germany and Italy in 1646.

==Private life==

Contemporary accounts described Lazarus as courteous and handsome, but for his brother who just dangled before him. When Lazarus was not exhibiting himself, he covered his brother with his cloak to avoid unnecessary attention.

Later accounts claim that Lazarus married and sired several children, none with his condition. His engraved portrait depicts him in a costume of a courtier of the period.

==Death Sentence==

As reported by Henri Sauval, Lazarus was sentenced to death for killing a man, but averted the execution by pointing out that this would also kill his innocent twin brother.

<doc id="981697" wikidata="Q4709895" url="?curid=981697" title="Albert Cashier">
<text>Albert D. J. Cashier (December 25, 1843 – October 10, 1915), born Jennie Irene Hodgers, was an Irish-born American soldier who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Cashier adopted the identity of a man before enlisting, and maintained it until death. Cashier became famous as one of at least 250 soldiers who were assigned female at birth and enlisted as men to fight in the Civil War. The consistent and nearly lifelong (at least 53 years) commitment to a male identity has prompted some historians to believe that Cashier was a trans man.

==Early life==
Cashier was very elderly and disoriented (suffering from dementia) when interviewed about immigrating to the United States and enlisting in the army, and had always been evasive about early life; therefore, the available narratives are often contradictory. According to later investigation by the administrator of Cashier&#x27;s estate, Albert Cashier was born Jennie Hodgers in Clogherhead, County Louth, Ireland, on December 25, 1843, to Sallie and Patrick Hodgers. Typically, the youth&#x27;s uncle or stepfather was said to have dressed his charge in male clothing in order to find work in an all-male shoe factory in Illinois. Even before the advent of the war, Hodgers adopted the identity of Albert Cashier in order to live independently. Sallie Hodgers, Cashier&#x27;s mother, was known to have died prior to 1862, by which time her child had traveled as a stowaway to Belvidere, Illinois, and was working as a farmhand to a man named Avery.

==Enlistment==
Cashier first enlisted in July 1862 after President Lincoln&#x27;s call for soldiers. As time passed, the need for soldiers only increased. On August 6, 1862, the eighteen-year-old enlisted in the 95th Illinois Infantry for a three-year term using the name &quot;Albert D.J. Cashier&quot; and was assigned to Company G. The Company Descriptive Book of the 95th shows the entry for Cashier, a 5&#x27;3&quot; soldier, nineteen years old with blue eyes and auburn hair, weighing 110 pounds. Cashier easily passed the medical examination because it consisted of showing one&#x27;s hands and feet. During the Civil War, many soldiers were young boys. Albert could not read or write and instead marked an X on the enlistment papers. Cashier&#x27;s fellow soldiers recalled that Cashier was reserved and preferred not to share a tent.

Many soldiers from Belvidere participated in the Battle of Shiloh as members of the Fifteenth Illinois Volunteers, where the Union had suffered heavy losses. Cashier took the train with others from Belvidere to Rockford in order to enlist, in answer to the call for more soldiers. Along with others from Boone and McHenry counties, Cashier was trained to be an infantryman of the 95th Regiment at Camp Fuller in Rockford. After being shipped out by steamer and rail to Confederate strongholds in Columbus, Kentucky and Jackson, Tennessee, the 95th was ordered to Grand Junction where the regiment became part of the Army of the Tennessee under General Ulysses S. Grant.

==During the war==
The regiment was part of the Army of the Tennessee under Ulysses S. Grant and fought in approximately forty battles, including the Siege of Vicksburg. During this campaign, Cashier was captured while performing reconnaissance, but managed to escape and return to the regiment. In June 1863, still during the siege, Cashier contracted chronic diarrhea and entered a military hospital, somehow managing to evade detection.

In the second quarter of 1864, the regiment was also present at the Red River Campaign under General Nathaniel Banks, and in June 1864 at the Battle of Brice&#x27;s Crossroads in Guntown, Mississippi, where they suffered heavy casualties.

Following a period to recuperate and regroup following the debacle at Brice, the 95th, now a seasoned and battle-hardened regiment, saw additional action in late 1864 through early 1865 in the Franklin–Nashville Campaign, at the battles of Spring Hill and Franklin, the defense of Nashville, and the pursuit of General Hood.

During the war, the regiment traveled a total of about 9,000 miles. Other soldiers thought that Cashier was small and preferred to be alone, which were not uncommon characteristics for soldiers. Cashier fought with the regiment through the war in over 40 battles until honorably discharged on August 17, 1865, when all the soldiers were mustered out.

==Postwar==

After the war, Cashier returned to Belvidere, Illinois, for a time, working for Samuel Pepper and continuing to live as a man. Settling in Saunemin, Illinois, in 1869, Cashier worked as a farmhand as well as performing odd jobs around the town, and can be found in the town payroll records. Cashier lived with employer Joshua Chesbro and his family in exchange for work, and had also slept for a time in the Cording Hardware store in exchange for labor. In 1885, the Chesbro family had a small house built for Cashier. For over forty years, Cashier lived in Saunemin and was a church janitor, cemetery worker, and street lamplighter. Living as a man allowed Cashier to vote in elections and to later claim a veteran&#x27;s pension under the same name. Pension payments started in 1907.

In later years, Cashier ate with the neighboring Lannon family. The Lannons discovered their friend&#x27;s sex when Cashier fell ill, but decided not to make their discovery public.

In 1911, Cashier, who was working for State Senator Ira Lish, was hit by the senator&#x27;s car, resulting in a broken leg. A physician found out Cashier&#x27;s secret in the hospital, but did not disclose the information. No longer able to work, Cashier was moved to the Soldiers and Sailors home in Quincy, Illinois, on May 5, 1911. Many friends and fellow soldiers from the Ninety-fifth Regiment visited. Cashier lived there until an obvious deterioration of mind began to take place, and was subsequently moved to the Watertown State Hospital for the Insane in East Moline, Illinois, in March 1914. Attendants at the Watertown State Hospital discovered Cashier&#x27;s sex, at which point Cashier was made to wear women&#x27;s clothes again after presumably more than fifty years of dressing as male. In 1914, Cashier was investigated for fraud by the veterans&#x27; pension board; former comrades confirmed that Cashier was in fact the person who had fought in the Civil War and the board decided in February 1915 that payments should continue for life.

==Death and legacy==
Albert Cashier died on October 10, 1915, and was buried in uniform. The government supplied the typical small gravestone used to mark a veteran&#x27;s resting place which was inscribed &quot;Albert D. J. Cashier, Co. G, 95 Ill. Inf.&quot; Cashier was given an official Grand Army of the Republic funerary service, and was buried with full military honors. It took W. J. Singleton (executor of Cashier&#x27;s estate) nine years to track Cashier&#x27;s identity back to the birth name of Jennie Hodgers. None of the would-be heirs proved convincing, and the estate of about $282 (after payment of funeral expenses) was deposited in the Adams County, Illinois, treasury. In 1977 local residents erected a larger second headstone, inscribed with both names, on the same plot at Sunny Slope cemetery in Saunemin, Illinois.

Cashier is listed on the internal wall of the Illinois memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park.

A musical entitled &quot;The Civility of Albert Cashier&quot; has been produced based on Cashier&#x27;s life; the work was described by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as &quot;A timely musical about a trans soldier&quot;. &quot;Also Known As Albert D. J. Cashier: The Jennie Hodgers Story&quot; is a biography written by veteran Lon P. Dawson, who lived at the Illinois Veterans Home where Cashier once lived. The novel &quot;My Last Skirt&quot;, by Lynda Durrant, is based on Cashier&#x27;s life. Cashier was mentioned in a collection of essays called &quot;Nine Irish Lives&quot;, in which Cashier&#x27;s biography was written by Jill McDonough.

In Michael Leali&#x27;s 2022 young adult novel, &quot;The Civil War of Amos Abernathy&quot;, Cashier stands in for a pen pal.

Cashier&#x27;s one-room house at the corner of Center and Maple Streets is now a historic site. The house served as a tool shed and nursery for hatchling chickens at one point and was relocated eight times in 137 years. In 1982, members of the local Women&#x27;s Club moved it back to Saunemin with plans to display it that never fully materialized. After this it was so dilapidated that local firefighters planned to burn it down as a training exercise. Former Pontiac tourism director Betty Estes rescued it in 1996 hours before the firefighters could set it ablaze. She relocated the house to Pontiac, and utilized it as a streets department shed. Later on, volunteers such as local historian and village board member Al Arnolts meticulously restored the house. &quot;We built a new framework and put it back together,&quot; Arnolts said. &quot;The shake shingles that are on the roof came from a cedar tree right here in town.&quot; The newly restored home was dedicated in a ceremony in August 2011.

Authors including Michael Bronski, Jason Cromwell, Kirstin Cronn-Mills, and Nicholas Teich have suggested or argued that Cashier was a trans man due to living as a man for at least 53 years.

<text>Howard Conklin Baskerville (10 April 1885 – 19 April 1909) was an American missionary teacher. His life ambition was to become a pastor. He worked as a teacher employed by the American missionaries at the American Memorial School in Tabriz, a Presbyterian mission school, and was killed during the Persian constitutional revolution in an attempt to break the siege of Tabriz. He is often referred to as the &quot;American Lafayette of Iran&quot; and the &quot;American Martyr of the Iranian Constitutional Movement&quot;.

Howard Baskerville came to Tabriz in the fall of 1907 to teach history. His arrival in Iran coincided with the period when Mohammad Ali Shah in Tehran shut down the parliament and dismantled the constitutional basis and ruled the period that is known as &quot;The short tyranny&quot; in Iran. At the same time, the people of Tabriz, led by Sattar Khan and Baqer Khan, rose up to restore constitutionalism, and subsequently, pro-Shah forces besieged Tabriz. After 11 months of siege and due to lack of medicine and food, a group in Tabriz called the &quot;Foj Nejat&quot; or Rescue squad led by Baskerville was formed to break the siege. Baskerville, who had attended in the military service in the United States, decided to teach military exercises to young people instead of &quot;narrating the history of the dead&quot; as he called it. At the same time, the death of Seyed Hassan Sharifzadeh, a close friend of Baskerville, upset him so much that in response to the wife of the US consul in Tabriz, who asked him to leave the ranks of constitutionalists, he withdrew his passport and said: &quot;The only difference between me and these people is my birthplace, and this is not a big difference.&quot; During the battle that took place in the Shanb Ghazan between the rescue squad led by Baskerville and the besiegers, Baskerville was killed by a bullet that hit him in the chest. After his death, a large funeral was held at the American Cemetery in Tabriz, which, according to Albert Charles Ratislaw, the British Consul in Tabriz, was a very impressive ceremony. Shortly afterward, Sattar Khan took Baskerville&#x27;s rifle (which was in his hand at the time of his death), engraved his name and date of death on it and wrapped it in the Iranian flag, and sent it to his family in the United States.

Soroush Esfahani, an Iranian poet, has written in mourning for him and his three hundred Muslim friends: &quot;We are 300 roses and a christian rose (Howard Baskerville) . We don&#x27;t scare to lose our heads. if that otherwise, we didn&#x27;t dance in the middle of lovers&#x27; celebration.&quot;

At present, a half-length statue of him has been installed in the Constitutional House of Tabriz. Some in the United States have suggested that April 19 be marked as &quot;Iranian-American Friendship Day&quot;, the anniversary of Howard Baskerville&#x27;s assassination.

At present, some unidentified enthusiasts alternately decorate his tombstone in the &quot;Assyrian Cemetery of Tabriz&quot; with fresh yellow flowers.

==Personal life==
Howard Conklin Baskerville was born on April 10, 1885, in North Platte, Nebraska. His father, grandfather, and four brothers were Presbyterian ministers and the family was of Scottish descent. During his youth his family moved to Black Hills, South Dakota.

Baskerville entered Princeton University in 1903. He graduated from the university in May 1907. Princeton University was then headed by Woodrow Wilson, who later became President of the United States. His main subject was religion; however, he chose two other focuses of study: judicial procedure and constitutional government. His younger brother, Robert Baskerville, graduated from Princeton University in 1912.

==Tabriz==
While in his final year at Princeton University, he corresponded with the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions (PBFM) in New York, requesting to be sent abroad to gain experience in a new language and culture. His goal was to be based in a foreign land for about two years after which he would return to America to continue his theological studies and become an ordained minister similar to his father and grandfather. His application for foreign service with the PBFM eventually resulted in his assignment as a teacher working for American missionaries to teach in Tabriz. Since Baskerville was not an ordained minister and intended to only serve for two years he was sent to Iran as a teacher on a short-term contract rather than as a missionary. Tabriz at that time hosted a large community of Americans living in Iran. American Christian missionaries had established schools and hospitals in northwestern Iran as early as 1835, primarily for Iran&#x27;s Armenian and Assyrian Christian populations. The Memorial School to which Baskerville was assigned as a teacher was one of the many schools established by Americans in Iran.

In the summer of 1907, Baskerville traveled to Tabriz, arriving there in early Autumn in time to teach English, history, and science to Iranian high school age young men at the American Memorial School, run by Presbyterian missionaries, on a two-year contract. He first sailed from the United States to England and from there to Iran. Then he traveled from Hamedan to Tabriz on horseback. Baskerville first settled in the home of Samuel Wilson (school principal). He later moved to the Memorial School, where American teachers lived.
Although he was not familiar with Persian or Azerbaijani, he still had a personal relationship with his students and met them at home. Sadegh Rezazadeh Shafaq, a student of Baskerville, who became close to him and acted as his translator, wrote about the day that Baskerville went to their house with Samuel Graham Wilson for Nowruz (Persian New Year):

In another section, Shafaq writes:
== Participation in the constitutional Revolution of Iran ==
Baskerville&#x27;s presence in Tabriz coincided with the days when Mohammad Ali Shah bombarded the parliament and suppressed the constitutionalists of different cities. On the other hand, the constitutionalists of Tabriz resisted the Shah&#x27;s request to surrender, and the Shah ordered the siege of Tabriz.

Baskerville supported the Iranian constitutional revolution from the beginning of his arrival in Tabriz. After school, he was serving food for constitutionalists on the battlefield and criticizing the Anglo-Russian Convention with his students. Baskerville became close to Hassan Sharifzadeh, who was a literature teacher at the same school and was one of the influential leaders of the constitutional revolution in Tabriz. Sharifzadeh&#x27;s assassination in 1908 deeply affected and upset him. This incident had a great impact on his joining the ranks of constitutional fighters.

=== Military training of constitutionalists ===
Baskerville had completed his military service in the United States shortly before he was sent to Iran. So after joining the ranks of the fighters, he took charge of providing military training to a group of constitutionalists, especially a number of Memorial School students. In March 1909, Baskerville decided to organize 150 of his students to help Sattar Khan break the siege of Tabriz. &quot;He kept repeating that he could not sit still and watch the hungry people of the city fight for their rights through the window of a classroom&quot;, Shafaq wrote. Baskerville asked his soldiers to &quot;take the lead in any war that took place, and when they approached the enemy they would not be in the trenches, they would attack the enemy with devotion&quot;.

=== U.S. government opposes Baskerville ===
Baskerville was under pressure from both groups for joining the Tabriz constitutionalists. The first group consisted of the parents of the school&#x27;s students and the second group consisted of the American diplomatic mission stationed at the US Consulate in Tabriz. Due to the neutrality of the United States government in the case of Iran, the presence of an American citizen in the heart of the Tabriz struggle was not considered appropriate.

Therefore, in order for the American consul and school officials not to be aware of his actions, Baskerville intended the courtyard of Tabriz Citadel to provide military training to Tabriz constitutionalists and conducted military training in the Tabriz Citadel area every evening. To motivate the fighters, Baskerville sometimes spoke to them about the characters of the American Revolution.

Baskerville&#x27;s actions and the conflict in Iran&#x27;s internal affairs caused concern in Washington, and William Doty, the US consul in Tabriz, wrote a letter dated January 1, 1909, and then, in a meeting with Baskerville in the presence of Sattar Khan, tried to separate him from the ranks of constitutional fighters. Sattar Khan, while appreciating Baskerville, encouraged him to withdraw from the battle. On April 2, 1909, while Baskerville and his men were in military training, William F. Doty, the US consul in Tabriz, came to the parade and reminded Baskerville that as an American citizen, he had no right to interfere in Iran&#x27;s domestic politics. In response, Baskerville called the struggle alongside the constitutionalists a defense of the lives and property of the Americans and the people of Tabriz. According to Shafaq, Baskerville said in response to the US consul: &quot;I can not ignore the suffering of these people who are fighting for their rights. I am an American citizen and I am proud of that, but I am a human being and I cannot stop feeling sympathy for the people of this city.&quot; Doty asked Baskerville to return his passport. Ahmad Kasravi writes that he submitted his passport to the consulate but Thomas Ricks quotes, &quot;I will not return my passport, and as an American I will support my just cause and join the Constitutional Revolution.&quot; Doty was furious that Baskerville was using the US Consulate Library&#x27;s Encyclopædia Britannica to find ways to make grenades.

The US consul once again sent his wife to dissuade Baskerville. In the same days, Baskerville&#x27;s close friend, Hassan Sharifzadeh, was killed and his death upset Baskerville so much that he replied to the US consul&#x27;s wife: &quot;The only difference between me and these people is my birthplace, and this is not a big difference.&quot; The US Department of State pressured the Central Committee of Christian Missionaries in New York to summon Baskerville from Iran, whose activities endangered the interests of the United States and the Presbyterian Church, until the news of Baskerville&#x27;s resignation on April 16 was announced to Washington.

According to research by Thomas Ricks, at the time, the Department of Defense was opposed to the involvement of missionaries in Iran&#x27;s internal affairs, and if missionaries interfered in Iran&#x27;s internal affairs, they would lose their jobs. About 50 Christian Presbyterians living in Tabriz at the time could not join the ranks of constitutionalists due to their commitment to the church. But they respected Baskerville&#x27;s efforts.

=== Forming rescue squad ===
In mid-April 1909, and ten months after the siege of Tabriz began, a small group called the Rescue Squad decided to cross the siege line and take food from the villages as food and medicine ran out. Baskerville volunteered for the mission and asked Sattar Khan for weapons. Sattar Khan believed that Baskerville and the soldiers of the Rescue Squad did not have enough experience to work with weapons, so he initially opposed their arming. But eventually the squad was armed. According to Annie Wilson, on April 15, she and a British journalist named D.C. Moore embarked on the mission. On April 19, the wheat supply in Tabriz was only enough for one day, and on the other hand, Sattar Khan failed to provide the cannon he had promised. Baskerville first tried to persuade Sattar Khan to ask the Europeans for help and surrender to the king on appropriate terms. But Sattar Khan was determined to launch another attack. Initially, at a meeting convened by the State Council on the night of Saturday, April 28, it was decided to attack the besieging group the following night, but it was finally decided that on Monday morning, April 19, to launch the attack.

With the help of the Rescue Squad that morning, it was decided to attack a part of the besieging forces of Tabriz, which was under the command of Samad Khan Shoja al-Dawla and a number of Cossacks, and break the city wall. Mehdi Alavizadeh, a member of the Rescue Squad, said: &quot;The night the attack on Samad Khan&#x27;s forces was to begin the next morning, Baskerville prepared and ordered his followers (members of the Rescue Squad) Before midnight, they gathered at the police station (Tabriz police building, which was one of the bases for nationalists)… (but) of those who had made a pact of sacrifice, only eleven people showed up, and others either did not show up, or their mothers and fathers Baskerville was aware, they stopped their sons; But from the others, a large group was prepared and around midnight we left for Qara Aghaj, and this neighborhood was full of fighters and artillerymen. We were taken to a mosque where we could rest for a few hours. &quot;Baskerville did not rest for a while, and inside the mosque he forced us to practice.&quot;

D. C. Moore, who was in another group that day, explained: &quot;I first heard that when he approached the enemy lines, the number of his troops had risen from 150 to five. But later, when I met the two men who were there, they said that there were about nine or 10 of them.&quot;

=== The battle of Shanb Ghazan ===
Shafaq describes the beginning of the war as follows: &quot;On the night of the 29th of Farvardin, the news of the readiness in the city was complicated. Our goal was the Shanb Ghazan. As I remember there was of us. It took us about an hour or so to reach Ghazan From the garden on the right side of the alley, we entered that alley and set foot there, Baskerville suddenly shouted &quot;attack&quot; and began to advance. Behind him I walked and several others accompanied. There was still silence, and perhaps the attackers wanted to surprise the other side. &quot;It was still dark when suddenly a series of rifles were fired at us. Our commander (Baskerville) immediately lay down on the side of the road, and we followed him behind a small mound of dirt.&quot;

As Baskerville led his men toward the city wall, he was shot by a sniper from the royal forces. Baskerville also fired at him, pushing his men forward, thinking the sniper had fled the scene. When Baskerville turned his back, the sniper returned and fired two shots at him, which hit him in the heart and left the other side of his body.

Shafaq recounted: 
In his memoirs, Mehdi Alavizadeh describes the events that led to Baskerville&#x27;s death:
Thus, Howard Baskerville was killed on Monday, April 19, 1909, just nine days after his 24th birthday, at the Battle of Ghazan.

A few days after Baskerville&#x27;s death, Russian soldiers entered the city in Tabriz under the pretext of saving the lives of their citizens, and as a result, the siege of Tabriz was broken. Subsequently, the constitutionalists of Tabriz, along with the fighters of other cities, succeeded in conquering Tehran and overthrowing Mohammad Ali Shah.

== Burial ==

After Baskerville was killed, his body was taken to the Wilson family home and prepared for burial. &quot;We know he gave his life for us&quot;, a businessman who brought cloth to decorate the Baskerville coffin told Annie Wilson. Thousands of people from Tabriz and Baskerville comrades attended the funeral. Shafaq described the ceremony as follows: &quot;There was no room in the American Church due to the crowd and there was a strange crowd on the way. The body was moved to the Armenian Cemetery in Tabriz in front of the fighters and in front of his students and soldiers.&quot; Parents of the Memorial School and American personalities were also among the attendees. &quot;Thousands of people had taken over the cemetery.&quot;

The British Consul in Tabriz, Albert Charles Ratislaw, reports that his funeral was a very influential one, attended by many members of the Azerbaijan Association and even attended the American Church to show their respect and appreciation for Baskerville which was quite unprecedented for Islamic hardliners.

In the cemetery, Seyed Hassan Taghizadeh, a member of the National Parliament, said in a short speech: &quot;Young America sacrificed the young Baskerville for the young Iranian constitution.&quot; Ahmad Kasravi, an eyewitness to the events of the constitutional era in Tabriz, says: &quot;... because he was considered a guest, everyone was saddened and withered when they heard of his death. In this regard, they decided to bury the dead body with great honor and glory. Although hunger has bothered everyone, but they didn&#x27;t care and they wanted to please the young American&#x27;s soul, standing all the way from the city to the cemetery, fighters lined up here and there with upside-down guns (as a sign of respect). Baskerville&#x27;s disciples and his band of devotees, Armenians, Georgians, Americans, and all freedom fighters, large and small, marched around the corpse with a bouquet of flowers. Shortly afterwards, Sattar Khan sent his family Baskerville&#x27;s rifle with his name and date of death engraved on it and wrapped in the Iranian flag, along with a photograph of members of the rescue squad.

Five days after Baskerville&#x27;s funeral, Sattar Khan and Jamani Ayoleti sent the following telegram to his parents in Spicer, Minnesota:
==Legacy==

When the National parliament resumed its sessions in November, one of its first actions was to deliver a speech at the Baskerville Memorial.

At the Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, there are many letters describing Baskerville. In 1959, the fiftieth anniversary of his death was completely planned and managed by the Tabrizis, much to the surprise of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

On Monday, April 20, 1980, the 50th anniversary of Baskerville&#x27;s death, a ceremony was held at Parvin School (formerly the Memorial School). The ceremony was organized by Ali Dehghan, Director General of the East Azerbaijan Culture Department, in the High School Hall, named after Baskerville. Iranian guests included Rezazadeh Shafaq, a student of Baskerville, and others such as Hassan Taghizadeh, Ismail Amirkhizi, Abolghasem Fayuzat, Ali Hiyat, Mehdi Alavizadeh, and Americans living in Tehran. The head of the cultural department, Hollinick, the first secretary, and Mrs. McDowell, an American missionary, were present.

Even when Iran-US relations were at their worst, Baskerville remained an exception. In December 1979, in the days of the hostage crisis, Thomas M. Ricks, a professor at Georgetown University, took a group of American clergymen to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Khomeini. They visited a mosque on the last day of the trip, when an Iranian man stood up and asked, &quot;Where are the American Baskervilles today?&quot;

In 2005, a bronze statue of Baskerville was unveiled at the Constitutional House of Tabriz by then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Below the bronze statue, the sentence is written in Persian: &quot;Howard C. Baskerville. He was a patriot, a history maker.&quot;

Some in the United States have suggested April 19 the anniversary of Howard Baskerville&#x27;s assassination to be marked as &quot;Iranian-American Friendship Day&quot;. on the anniversary of Baskerville&#x27;s assassination in 2014, Alan Eyre, a Persian-speaking spokesman for the US State Department, described Baskerville as a martyr on his Facebook page.

In 2015, a group from the United States, led by Stephen Kinzer, visited the grave of Howard Baskerville in the Armenian Cemetery in Tabriz.

There are many Iranians who praise Baskerville and consider him a martyr. He is buried in the Assyrian Cemetery of Tabriz (then the American Cemetery) in Tabriz, and some unidentified enthusiasts alternately decorate his tombstone with fresh yellow flowers.

In late 2022, Iranian-American scholar Reza Aslan published &quot;An American Martyr in Persia: The Epic Life and Tragic Death of Howard Baskerville&quot;, which &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called &quot;an intriguing read that breathes life into a pivotal moment of Persian/Iranian history&quot;.

== Fiction ==
Chapter XL of the historical fiction novel &quot;Samarkand&quot;, written by French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, revolves around Baskerville and the Persian Constitutional Revolution.

<doc id="981700" wikidata="Q539306" url="?curid=981700" title="Marie-Louise Dissard">
<text>Marie-Louise Dissard, (6 November 1881 – July 1957) (code named &quot;Françoise&quot;), was a member of the French Resistance during the German occupation of France in World War II. She initially worked with the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line, a network which helped downed Allied airmen evade German capture and return to Great Britain. The O&#x27;Leary Line was first headed by Ian Garrow and later by Albert Guérisse. In 1943, after their arrests and the destruction of the O&#x27;Leary Line by the German Gestapo, Dissard created an escape network called the Francoise Line. The Francoise Line helped more than 250 Allied airmen escape occupied France and return to Great Britain. Including her work with the O&#x27;Leary line, Dissard helped more than 700 allied airmen escape from France. She received financial assistance from the British intelligence agency, MI9.

Dissard was honored with the Legion of Honor by France, the George Medal by the United Kingdom, and the Medal of Freedom by the United States. She shares the distinction of being one of very few women to head World War II resistance organizations in France, another prominent woman leader being Marie-Madeleine Fourcade. Andrée de Jongh, head of the Comet Line which operated in France, was Belgian.

==Before World War II==
Marie-Louise Dissard was born in Cahors, the daughter of Guillaume and Leontine Dissard. Guillaume was a teacher and Leontine a fashion designer. Dissard worked as a secretary for the government of the city of Toulouse. A talented seamstress, she later opened a small dressmaking shop selling &quot;modern feminine frivolities.&quot; She never married and was an advocate for female independence and freedom. Dissard was small, cheerful, talkative, opinionated, and anti-fascist. She seemed never to sleep and to survive on black coffee and cigarettes held in a long, ivory holder which was always in her mouth. She was followed around by her pet cat named Mifouf. The French police considered her mentally unbalanced.

==The Pat O&#x27;Leary Escape Line==

Fifty-eight years old when France surrendered to Germany in June 1940, Dissard first resisted the Germans by distributing anti-Nazi propaganda in Toulouse for the &quot;Bertaux Network.&quot; In December 1941 the leader of that group and several of his followers were arrested and imprisoned by French police. Dissard cooked food for the resisters and took it to the prison two or three times a week. In early July 1942, she met Paul Ullman who was working for the O&#x27;Leary escape network. He told her he was hiding English airmen, shot down over Europe, in his home and organizing their escape to Spain. She began to shelter downed airmen in her own apartment and rented a villa in Toulouse to shelter more airmen. She used the code name &quot;Françoise.&quot; By December 1942, she was the leader of the O&#x27;Leary line in Toulouse. She enlisted guides and found safe houses for airmen on the run from the Germans. She supplied the airmen with food (mostly purchased on the black market due to rationing), civilian clothing, and medicine, running the line out of her small apartment in the shadow of Gestapo headquarters. She arranged escape routes over the Pyrenees to Spain for airmen and sometimes accompanied them for part of their journey. She also organized the escape of six resistance members and two American airmen from a French jail.

The occupation of Vichy France by German forces in November 1942 made resistance to the Germans more dangerous as German authorities and the Gestapo stepped up efforts to infiltrate and destroy the escape lines operating in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands and funneling downed airmen toward safety in neutral Spain. Conscious of the increased danger to its members, the O&#x27;Leary line arranged the escape of founder Ian Garrow from a French prison on 6 December 1942. Garrow stayed in Dissard&#x27;s apartment until he could be smuggled to Spain and return to Great Britain. On 2 March 1943 the leader of the O&#x27;Leary Line, Albert Guérisse, was arrested by the Gestapo.

==The Françoise Line==

MI9 officer Airey Neave said that with the arrests of Guérisse and other members of the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line, &quot;Dissard and her cat were almost the only survivors of the O&#x27;Leary organization.&quot; Dissard assumed leadership of the remnants which came to be called the Françoise Line after her code name. Fearing arrest, she fled Toulouse temporarily for Bergerac and relocated nine fugitives to new safe houses, including four airmen and a courier for the O&#x27;Leary Line, Nancy Wake, arranging for their passage to Spain. Lacking funds, she then made a clandestine journey to Switzerland and arranged with a British Vice Consul, Victor Farrell, to continue to fund the Line. With regular payments from the British ensured, she reorganized the many safe houses and helpers of the Line scattered all over southern France. She herself escorted airmen by train from various cities and towns to Toulouse and onward to Perpignan where the airmen were turned over to guides who escorted them across the Pyrenees to Spain. Her deputy was Jean Bregi, an associate from the O&#x27;Leary Line.

In January 1944, one of her guides was captured and had the address of her safe house in Toulouse in his notebook. She managed to escape arrest, move airmen to new safe houses, and, with the Gestapo on her trail, hid out in attics and basements in Toulouse. She eventually returned to live surreptitiously in her apartment which was near Gestapo headquarters. With her freedom of movement limited, a young man named Gabriel Nahas who was experienced in moving Jews across the Spanish border became the principal escort of airmen from Toulouse to Perpignan.

The German occupation of France ended after an allied invasion in summer 1944. Dissard had helped rescue and repatriate more than 250 allied airmen. The escape organizations were labor-intensive and Dissard recommended 123 of her helpers, including 24 women, for postwar awards.

==Honours and awards==
After the war, the United Kingdom awarded her the George Medal, a very senior decoration, and the United States awarded her the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the U.S. In Toulouse, the &quot;Lycée professionnel Marie Louise Dissard Françoise&quot; was named in her honor. A street, the Rue de Marie-Louise Dissard, in Toulouse is named after her.

<text>André Dewavrin DSO, MC (9 June 1911 – 20 December 1998) (colonel &quot;Passy)&quot; was a French officer who served with Free French Forces intelligence services during World War II.

== Biography ==
He was born in Paris, the son of a businessman. He graduated as an army engineer and in 1938 began to teach as a professor in Saint Cyr military academy.

After the outbreak of World War II, Dewavrin was assigned to Norway in 1940 before he joined General Charles de Gaulle in Britain. He received the rank of major, took charge of the Free French military intelligence unit Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action (BCRA) and took the codename &quot;Colonel Passy&quot;. He began to help organise the French Resistance movement and co-operated with the SOE.

Some of Dewavrin&#x27;s closest colleagues (Captain Fourcaud and Lieutenant Duclos) were Cagoulards (a right-wing group), but Dewavrin always denied being one and insisted that he had supported the Republic during the Spanish Civil War and had opposed the Munich Agreement.

Dewavrin collated information from the French Resistance and planned operations for 350 agents who were parachuted to France to work with them. He secretly traveled to France on occasion to meet with the Resistance and coordinate intelligence gathering and sabotage. On 23 February 1943 Dewavrin parachuted to France alongside Pierre Brossolette to meet with Jean Moulin.

Later in 1943, Dewavrin&#x27;s organization was merged with the conventional secret service of the Free French Forces to form DGSS under Jacques Soustelle. Dewavrin served as Soustelle&#x27;s technical advisor before he took the lead of the organisation in October 1944. After the Normandy Invasion, Dewavrin became Chief of Staff to General Marie Pierre Koenig, the Commander of the French Forces of the Interior.

After the war, Dewavrin was head of intelligence for de Gaulle&#x27;s provisional government until de Gaulle resigned in January 1946. His successor accused Dewavrin of embezzling Free French money for his own purposes. Dewavrin was jailed for four months in Vincennes. He was eventually acquitted for lack of evidence. The British historian Antony Beevor suspects that Dewavrin might have tried to collect money to work against a possible communist takeover attempt.

Dewavrin published three volumes of memoirs in 1947, 1949 and 1951 and eventually retired from the army to become a businessman.

He portrayed himself in Jean Pierre Melville&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Armée des ombres&quot;.

According to &quot;The Secret War&quot; by Max Hastings, a Soviet spy made a claim in a report to Moscow that Dewavrin had been recruited by Wilhelm Canaris to work for the Germans. Hastings stated that report was false but supplied no reference to support his statement.

<text>Aydın Dikmen (born October 15, 1937 – April 8, 2020) was a Turkish art dealer who was arrested in 1998 for trying to sell Eastern Orthodox art that had been looted from Cyprus during the 1974 invasion.

During the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974, some of the churches and monasteries in the area were looted for art treasures. He is responsible of looting over 50 Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Maronite monuments as well as archaeological sites and private collections. Among the looted artefacts are mosaics, frescoes, manuscripts, icons, doors and prehistoric artefacts. Greek Cypriot authorities now suspect that Dikmen had a major part of stripping the churches of their treasures or at least selling them.

Dikmen sold thirteenth-century frescoes from the St. Evphemianos church near Lysi, Cyprus to the Menil Foundation in Houston, Texas in 1984. The Cypriot church approved the deal providing that the frescoes would be returned to Cyprus eventually.

In 1988 Dikmen, Dutch art dealer Michel van Rijn and associate Robert Fitzgerald sold four Kanakaria church mosaics to US dealer Peg Goldberg for $1 million. When she tried to sell them to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, the museum curator contacted Greek Cypriot authorities. After a 1989 trial a federal court in Indianapolis ordered them to be returned to the Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus. They currently reside in the Byzantine Museum in Cyprus.

In March 1998, after an 8-month sting operation initiated by Tasoula Hadjitofi, Honorary Consul of Cyprus in The Netherlands, Munich police recovered more treasures from apartments Dikmen had rented with a false names. Dikmen was arrested after he was videotaped when he tried to sell the treasures. Michel van Rijn cooperated with the police but later refused to testify against Dikmen after he had received death threats.

The returned loot included 30 frescoes from the Antifonitis monastery, a mosaic from Kanakaria church and a number of icons. They were taken to the Bavarian National Museum for safekeeping before being returned to Cyprus.

In July 2024 the last 60 looted antiquities were returned to Cyprus from Germany after an agreement between the two countries. The artefacts are 24 ecclesiastical relics and 36 prehistoric and other antiquities.

<text>Oboe was a British bomb aiming system developed to allow their aircraft to bomb targets accurately in any type of weather, day or night. Oboe coupled radar tracking with radio transponder technology. The guidance system used two well-separated radar stations to track the aircraft. Two circles were created before the mission, one around each station, such that they intersected at the bomb drop point. The operators used the radars, aided by transponders on the aircraft, to guide the bomber along one of the two circles and drop the bombs when they reached the intersection.

The system was developed in 1942 by the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern in Worcestershire, working in close association with 109 Squadron. By December 1942 a working system had been developed. The first major use of Oboe was in March 1943 when the system was used to mark the Krupp Works in an attack against Essen. Over the course of the month the system was used with great success to mark targets for the Main Force against the German industrial center of the Ruhr and for attacks against Cologne. Through November 1943 Oboe was used with good success against targets within its 250 mile range.

In December 1943 Bomber Command entered what was hoped to be a war winning campaign with the Battle of Berlin. Berlin was over the horizon for even the highest flying RAF aircraft, and thus beyond the range of Oboe. The campaign had to depend upon straight navigation and H2S. Bomber Command&#x27;s efforts against Berlin over the next four months were unsuccessful. At the end of March Bomber Command was directed to serve under SHAEF to make preparations for the invasion of occupied Europe. These missions to northern France allowed Oboe to again demonstrate its value in the precision delivery of markers or bombs, regardless of weather or the visibility of the target.

Neither H2S nor Gee-H could provide the accuracy of Oboe. By guidance direction of individual aircraft, Oboe was used both to guide marker aircraft for the Main Force and for bombing aircraft making precision bombings of high value targets. It was by far the most accurate bombing system used during the war.

==History==

===Background===
In order to accurately determine one&#x27;s location relative to objects on the ground one needs two data points; two angles (as in triangulation), two distances (trilateration), or an angle and a distance (VOR/DME). Using radio to provide some or all of these measurements was an area of continual development leading up to the start of the war. The Germans pioneered this approach with operational systems like Lorenz beam and &quot;X-Gerät&quot; that used two narrow beam-like signals that crossed at a point in the sky to indicate a target using triangulation. Later, during The Blitz, the Germans introduced &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;, which combined a single Lorenz beam with a transponder-based distance measurement to fix locations. The problem with all of these systems was that they produced no information except within their narrow beams, and were not useful for general purpose navigation.

A more useful system was introduced in the RAF&#x27;s Gee system, which used two timed signals that allowed the navigator on the bomber to determine their location using trilateration. It could be used anywhere within line-of-sight of the transmitter stations in the UK, and generally provided a reasonable signal up to about , depending on the aircraft&#x27;s altitude. Gee was read on an oscilloscope display about across, which limited the accuracy of the timing measurements. As a result, Gee was accurate on the order of kilometers, which was extremely useful for navigation and area bombing, but did not provide the accuracy needed for pinpoint bombing.

As the accuracy of Gee was largely relative to the mechanical size of the indicator unit, the accuracy could be improved by using a larger display. However, in these early days of the cathode-ray tube (CRT), such displays were extremely expensive and very long, which made them unsuitable for fitting to a large number of Bomber Command aircraft.

===Initial proposal===
The concept of reversing the display arrangement so the display could be on the ground and the transmitter on the aircraft was obvious. It had first been suggested by Alec Reeves of Standard Telephones and Cables in 1940 and then formally presented with the help of Francis Jones in the spring of 1941.

The basic idea would be to have two ground stations that would periodically send out signals on similar but separate frequencies. The aircraft carried transponders, one for each signal, which re-broadcast the signals upon reception. By timing the total round trip time from broadcast to reception and then dividing by twice the speed of light (the signal travels to the aircraft and back again) the distance to the aircraft could be determined. This was essentially identical to radar, with the exception that the transponder greatly amplified the signals for the return journey, which aided accuracy by providing strong, sharply defined signal pulses.

A practical problem was using these range measurements to guide a bomber towards its target. In the case of &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;, a single beam was used that produced a natural path for the bomber to fly along. Only the range along this path needed to be measured and relayed to the bomber crew. In the case of a system using two range measurements, there was no inherent path in the sky for the aircraft to follow. Locations and directions could be determined by the phoning the two range measurements to a plotting room, drawing arcs from the stations at those measured distances, and then locating the intersection. However, this took time, during which the aircraft moved, making it too slow to provide the desired accuracy.

Oboe adopted a simple solution to this problem. Before the mission, a path was defined that represented the arc of a circle whose radius passed through the target as measured from one of the two stations. This station was given the name &quot;Cat&quot;. The aircraft would then use conventional navigation techniques, dead reckoning or Gee if it was equipped, to place itself some distance north or south of the target on a point near this line. They would then begin flying towards the target, at which point an operator at Cat would call out corrections to have the aircraft fly closer or further from the station until it was flying at precisely the right range to keep it on the circle.

The Cat station continued to keep the aircraft positioned at this precise distance as it flew towards the target, causing the aircraft to fly along the pre-defined arc. The second station, code-named &quot;Mouse&quot;, also calculated the range to the target before the mission. As the bomber approached that predetermined range they would first call out a &quot;heads up&quot; to tell the bomb aimer to begin the run, and then a second signal at the right time to drop it. Using this method there was no need for the two stations to compare measurements or perform any trigonometry to determine an actual location in space, both performed simple range measurements directly off their screen and sent their separate corrections to the aircraft.

In practice, ranges were not sent by voice to the aircraft. Instead, a tone generator produced Morse code dots or dashes under the control of the operators. This was similar to the beam systems like Lorenz, which the UK aircrew were already familiar with using as a blind landing aid in the pre-war period. If the aircraft was too close to the station the operator would play the dot signal, and when they were too far, dashes. The two could be mixed so that as they approached the correct range, the dots would fill in the gaps between the dashes and form a steady tone.

Periodically the signal would be keyed to send out a letter to indicate how far they were from the correct range, X indicating , Y , and Z . Likewise, the Mouse station sent a series of keyed signals to indicate the approach, S to indicate the approach was starting, and then A, B, C and D as the aircraft approached.

===Development and testing===
There were some obvious problems with this approach, however. One of the most obvious is that any given ground station could only track a single aircraft at a time, compared to Gee where any bomber could pick up the signals from the UK and carry out the necessary calculations. This did not immediately eliminate it as a useful system; &quot;Y-Gerät&quot; had the same limitation, so it was used for target marking by flying one aircraft under control and having it drop flares for the following aircraft to drop on. The British adopted the same solution.

A more worrying concern was that the bomber aircraft would have to fly straight and level along a gently curving path while the ground station monitored its range as it flew towards the target. During this time the aircraft would be open to attack, which some considered to be almost suicidal. Lastly, the British had no difficulty jamming the German &quot;Y-Gerät&quot; system, even before it was widely used. There was no reason to expect the Germans would not do the same with Oboe as soon as they detected the signals.

Despite widespread opposition to the use of Oboe, A.P. Rowe ordered development to begin. Development began both on the 1.5 m wavelength shared by most early UK radar systems, but also at the new &quot;fashionable&quot; 10 cm microwave wavelength provided by the cavity magnetron. The latter would not only provide higher accuracy, but also be largely immune to jamming unless the Germans developed their own high-power microwave devices. This only occurred in the very last days of the war.

Two stations were set up as far east as possible, one in Dover (Walmer) and a second in Cromer (RAF Trimingham). On any given mission, one of the stations would be Cat and the other Mouse. In early testing in September 1941, an aircraft flying along the arc from Dover demonstrated an accuracy of , better than any bombing method then in use. Accuracy with bombs was not quite as good, as the bombs themselves were not identical and had slightly different trajectories. In a demonstration for senior officials on 2 July 1942, the system demonstrated a real-world accuracy of . In contrast, even using advanced visual bombsights like the Norden, average accuracies in 1942 were on the order of .

Oboe was first used in experimental operations by Short Stirling heavy bombers in December 1941, attacking Brest. These aircraft had a relatively limited service ceiling, and was limited to attacks at short-range where they maintained line-of-sight to the UK.

At that time there was a great debate taking place in Bomber Command over the use of &quot;pathfinders&quot;, specialized aircraft and crews that would find the targets and use flares to mark them for attack. The same technique had first been used during the Blitz by the Germans, notably by the specialist Kampfgruppe 100, but its effectiveness had been severely curtailed by British jamming efforts. Nevertheless, the concept had enough backing that a small force of Mosquitoes had been organized to operate as a pathfinder force, using normal optical sighting. This proved disappointing in practice, offering only a slight improvement in accuracy.

But the Mosquitoes were also the only aircraft that had the performance to fly at altitudes at which the Oboe signals could be received over Germany. At a meeting in the summer of 1942, it was agreed that the pathfinder Mosquitoes would be equipped with Oboe. Having faced opposition before, the addition of Oboe upset the argument against the specialist role, and what would become Pathfinder Force began forming over the ongoing objections.

===Into service===
The first experiments with Oboe in a combat setting over Germany began on the night of 20/21 December 1942, when a small force of six Oboe-equipped Mosquitoes were sent to bomb a power station at Lutterade in the Netherlands, on the German border. Three of the sets failed, but the three remaining aircraft, led by Squadron Leader L.E. Bufton, were able to drop properly. A follow-up reconnaissance mission the next day showed that nine of the bomb craters could be identified, all of them clustered closely together but some away from the target. Similar tests with small numbers of Oboe aircraft, sometimes dropping flares for small numbers of Avro Lancasters following them, were made throughout December and January.

At first, the Germans wrote off these small attacks as nuisance raids, intended to upset production by sending the workers to the air raid shelters. However, it was soon realized that something very odd was occurring; aircraft were dropping only 6 to 10 bombs, often through heavy cloud cover, and having 80 to 90% of them hit their targets, normally blast furnaces or power stations. As part of this process, the bombers released photoflash flares, which lit up the ground below the aircraft enough for photography. On 7 January 1943, Hauptmann Alexander Dahl noted these and suggested that they were using the photographs to correct for measurement errors of a new bombing system.

This was precisely what had been happening. Over the UK Oboe demonstrated accuracy on the order of tens of metres, but over the Continent the early tests always produced worse results. But it was soon clear there was a pattern to the misses, which was surmised to be due to differences in the surveying grids used on the continent. The solution to this problem was provided by the Germans themselves; before the war they had made an effort to calibrate the two systems in a series of cross-Channel measurements that the UK Ordnance Survey also received. Using these corrections they were able to address the inaccuracies almost immediately.

By the late spring Bomber Command crews had practised the bomb-on-marker technique enough to begin major operations. Harris then began a series of raids known as the Battle of the Ruhr, opening with a raid on Essen on 5 March that produced rather poor results in spite of proper marking. The next major raid against the Krupp factory in Essen on 12/13 March was somewhat more successful, followed by a mix of raids that met with very different results. By May, however, the technique was tuned and a series of very large raids, typically with 500 to 800 bombers, demonstrated increasingly successful results. Among these was a late-May raid on Dortmund that caused the Hoesch steelworks to cease production, and a late July raid on Krupps that Goebbels stated had caused &quot;complete stoppage of production in the Krupps works&quot;. Analysis of the results demonstrated that the number of bombs that fell on their targets doubled from the pre-Oboe era.

===German countermeasures===
Oboe missions were clearly identifiable to German radar operators; the aircraft would start some distance north or south of the target and then approach it on an arcing path they referred to as &quot;Boomerang&quot;. Although the operators quickly became accustomed to these aircraft, actually arranging an interception of the high-flying and high-speed aircraft proved extremely difficult.

It took the Germans more than a year to decipher the operation of the system, led by the engineer H. Widdra, who had detected the British &quot;Pip-squeak&quot; Identification friend or foe [IFF] system in 1940. The first attempt to jam Oboe took place at the end of August 1943 during an attack on the Bochumer Verein steelworks in Essen. A system set up at the Maibaum tracking station in Kettwig broadcast false dot and dash signals on the 1.5 m band, hoping to make it impossible for the pilot to figure out if they were at the right position. This was the same technique that the British had used against German systems during The Blitz.

Unknown to the Germans, the Oboe system had already moved to the microwave-frequency 10 cm (3GHz) Oboe Mk. II, but the British kept broadcasting the older signals as a ruse. The failure to jam Oboe remained a mystery until July 1944, when the older signal was incorrectly set to mark one target while a pathfinder perfectly marked another. The Germans quickly surmised that there was another signal or system in use. The Germans were well acquainted with the British microwave systems in the 10 cm area, but in April 1944 the RAF had already introduced Oboe Mk. III, which resisted German jamming efforts. Mk. III also allowed up to four aircraft to use a set of frequencies (stations) and allowed different styles of approach, not just the arc.

===Late war use===
By this point the Battle of the Ruhr was long over and the majority of the RAF&#x27;s bombing efforts concentrated on targets that were too far into Germany to be visible to Oboe. H2S took on the primary role in this era. The D-Day invasions and subsequent breakout allowed this to be addressed by setting up new Oboe stations on the continent.

Late in the war, Oboe was used to assist food drops to the Dutch still trapped under German occupation, as part of Operation Manna. Drop points were arranged with the Dutch Resistance and the food canisters were dropped within about of the aiming point using Oboe.

==Technical details==
Oboe used two stations at well-separated locations in England to transmit a signal to a Mosquito Pathfinder bomber carrying a radio transponder. The transponder re-transmitted the signals, which were then received by the two stations. The round-trip time of each signal gave the distance to the bomber.

Each Oboe station used radio ranging to define a circle of specific radius. The intersection of the two circles pinpointed the target. The Mosquito flew along the circumference of the circle defined by one station, known as the &quot;Cat&quot;, and dropped its load (either bombs or marking flares, depending on the mission) when it reached the intersection with the circle defined by another station, known as &quot;Mouse&quot;. There was a network of Oboe stations over southern England and any of the stations could be operated as a Cat or a Mouse.

The Mark I Oboe was derived from Chain Home Low technology, operating at upper-range VHF frequencies of 200 MHz (1.5 metres). The two stations emitted a series of pulses at a rate of about 133 per second. The pulse width could be made short or long so it was received by the aircraft as a Morse code dot or dash. The Cat station sent continuous dots if the aircraft was too close and continuous dashes if the aircraft was too far and from these the pilot could make course corrections. (The Germans used a similar method with &quot;Knickebein&quot;.)

Various Morse letters could also be sent; for example, to notify an aircrew that their Mosquito was within a range of the target. The Mouse station sent five dots and a dash to indicate bomb release. The Mouse station included a bombsight computer, known as &quot;Micestro&quot;, to determine the proper release time; there was no particular logic in carrying the bombsight on the Mosquito when it was under the control of the ground station.

Although Oboe had been tested against Essen in January 1943, Oboe was rarely used for &quot;big industrial plants&quot; such as those in the Ruhr Area. The basic idea of Oboe came from Alec Reeves of Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd, implemented in a partnership with Frank Jones of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE); also part of the team was Dr Denis Stops, who later became a leading physicist at University College London. Denis Stops&#x27; role in the development of Oboe was so secret that he was drafted into the RAF Pathfinder Squadron as a Wing Commander to conduct his work. His role was largely to develop the systems on the aircraft in conjunction with the land-based radar systems. The system worked by using triangulation to pin-point the target. Dr. Stops once said that one unexpected spin-off of the system was that the Germans often did not know what the British were planning to bomb.

==Similar systems==
The Germans improvised a system conceptually similar to Oboe, code named &quot;Egon&quot;, for bombing on the Eastern Front on a limited scale. It used two modified Freyas to play the roles of Cat and Mouse; these two &quot;Freya Egon&quot; sets were located about apart and the aircraft carried a two-channel IFF to respond to them. A director at each of the stations would provide course correction directions to the pilot by radio transmission. Though the Germans put considerable effort into other electronic navigation systems, they never developed this concept further.

Oboe had one major limitation: it could only be used by one aircraft at a time. To address this, the British came up with a new guidance scheme using the same elements, but mounting the transmitter in the aircraft and placing the transponders in the ground stations. More than one aircraft could use the two stations because random noise was inserted into the timing of each aircraft&#x27;s transmitter pulse output. The receiving gear on the aircraft could match its own unique pulse pattern with that sent back by the transponders. Each receive–reply cycle took the transponder 100 microseconds, allowing it to handle a maximum of 10,000 interrogations per second and making &quot;collisions&quot; unlikely. The practical limit was about 80 aircraft under guidance of two stations at one time. This new scheme was called &quot;GEE-H&quot; (or &quot;G-H&quot;)

The name &quot;GEE-H&quot; can be confusing, as the scheme was a modification upon Oboe. The name was adopted because the system was based on GEE technologies, operating on the same waveband of 15 to 3.5 metres / 20 to 85 MHz, and initially used the GEE display and calibrator. The &quot;H&quot; suffix came from the system using the twin-range or &#x27;H&#x27; principle of measuring the range from transponders at &quot;two&quot; ground stations. It was nearly as accurate as Oboe itself.

==In popular culture==
Oboe appears as a plot point in the &quot;Lost Sheep&quot; episode of the BBC television series &quot;Secret Army&quot;, which featured the search for a downed airman with technical knowledge of the system.

<text>Henry Sewell (; 7 September 1807 – 14 May 1879) was a New Zealand politician. He was a notable campaigner for New Zealand self-government, and is generally regarded as having been the country&#x27;s first premier (a post that would later be officially titled &quot;Prime Minister&quot;), having led the Sewell Ministry in 1856. He later served as Colonial Treasurer (1856–1859), as Attorney-General (1861–1862), and twice as Minister of Justice (1864–1865, 1869–1872).

==Early life==
Sewell was the fourth son of Thomas Sewell, a solicitor, and his wife Jane . He was born on 7 September 1807 in the town of Newport, on England&#x27;s Isle of Wight. He was educated at Hyde Abbey School near Winchester. He qualified as a solicitor, and joined his father&#x27;s law firm in 1826.

In 1840, however, Sewell&#x27;s father lost a staggering sum of money when a bank failed, and died shortly afterwards, leaving the family with a great deal of debt. This put considerable strain on Sewell. In 1844, Sewell also suffered from the untimely death of his wife Lucinda (whom he had married on 15 May 1834 and had six children with). He put his sister in charge of his children and his mother and moved to London for better opportunities.

Sewell remarried, probably on 23 January 1850, and made plans to emigrate with his new wife Elizabeth Kittoe to New Zealand, hoping for improved financial prospects in the colony.

Sewell&#x27;s connection to New Zealand arose through the Canterbury Association, a British organisation dedicated to the colonisation of the New Zealand region known as Canterbury. It is probable that John Simeon introduced Sewell to the Association, and he interacted greatly with John&#x27;s brother Charles. Until Sewell&#x27;s departure for New Zealand, he was the Association&#x27;s deputy director, and contributed greatly to its activities. The Association&#x27;s plan for colonisation encountered a number of serious problems, however, and considerable debts were incurred. Sewell was instrumental in solving these problems. Sewell personally arrived in Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch (the principal settlement in Canterbury) on 2 February 1853, hoping to sort out what remained of the colony&#x27;s problems. Gradually, and despite conflict with provincial superintendent James FitzGerald, Sewell managed to get the colony back onto a reasonable course. Charles Simeon and family lived in Canterbury from October 1851 to December 1855, and they were the only people who Sewell and his wife socialised with.

==Political career==

===1st Parliament===
 


Sewell&#x27;s diary, published in 1980 as the Sewell Journal in two volumes, gives a unique insight into his life in the colony. The journal&#x27;s editor, historian W. David McIntyre, calls it &quot;the most absorbing and undoubtedly the fullest private manuscript relating to New Zealand in the 1850s&quot;. In late July 1853, Sewell decided that he would stand for Parliament in the 1853 general election; the question was whether he should run in the Town of Christchurch or the Christchurch Country electorate. There was one position to be filled in the town electorate, and two in the rural electorate. Sewell sought counsel from some friends, who recommended for him to stand in the rural electorate, but he did not want to oppose Guise Brittan, who had already declared his candidacy. Whilst Brittan was unpopular with the constituency, Sewell thought that it would be useful to have him in Parliament. The complication with the town electorate was that John Watts-Russell had already received a pledge from the majority of that constituency, but there were rumours that he would not stand, and it was known that he was just about to go travelling during the time of the election campaign. Sewell talked to Brittan, who fully supported him standing in the town electorate, and Brittan pledged that he would get his brother-in-law, Charles Fooks, to canvas for him. Sewell first advertised his candidacy in the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot; on 30 July. In the same edition of the newspaper, James Stuart-Wortley and Guise Brittan advertised their candidacy for the Christchurch Country electorate. Jerningham Wakefield reiterated his candidacy for the Christchurch Country electorate in early August upon his return from Wellington. At the same time, Fooks announced his candidacy for the Town of Christchurch electorate. With James FitzGerald, who had just been elected the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province, apparently in support of Watts-Russell, Sewell decided to withdraw from the contest, but decided to go ahead with a public meeting to &#x27;speak his mind&#x27;. On 4 August, he held a meeting at the Golden Fleece, a hotel on the corner of Colombo and Armagh Streets, and addressed between 30 and 40 electors. He discussed all the issues that Parliament should deal with, but finished by saying that he would not be available as a candidate, as Watts-Russell had been pledged the support of the constituency. After an awkward period of silence, Richard Packer stood up and replied:

We are in an awkward position. Here was a Gentleman who told [us] all sorts of things which a Representative ought to attend to and then declined standing himself, because of another Candidate whose intentions no one knew anything about—and who was just on the point of starting for an excursion without giving any one an opportunity of learning his sentiments about anything.

The meeting expressed dissatisfaction with Watts-Russell and that they would not hold themselves bound to support him. FitzGerald spoke in support of Watts-Russell, but was not well received. Fooks then spoke, but mainly to attack Sewell. The following day, Sewell met with FitzGerald and discussed that either himself or Watts-Russell should retire from the contest, but that if he himself was to retire, then Watts-Russell or at least some of his friends should inform the constituency about his intentions. FitzGerald&#x27;s impression was that it should be Watts-Russell who should retire. Later that day, Watts-Russell wrote an announcement that he would retire from the contest, which was published in the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot; on 13 August.
On 9 August, the Colonists&#x27; Society held a meeting at the White Hart Hotel. Christchurch&#x27;s first hotel was on the High Street (then called Sumner Road) and Cashel Street corner, with Michael Hart as proprietor. The 50 to 60 attendees were addressed by Sewell, Stuart-Wortley, and Wakefield. As a result, committees were formed that were to achieve the return of these three candidates. At this point, Sewell thought that Brittan would not have a chance of getting elected, as he was most unpopular, and he refused to go canvassing. Over the next few days, Octavius Mathias, the vicar of St Michael and All Angels, was Sewell&#x27;s main antagonist.

The nominations for the town and country electorates were held together on Tuesday, 16 August. The hustings were erected in front of the Land Office (these days the site of Our City). The three candidates for the Christchurch Country electorate spoke first, with Stuart-Wortley and Wakefield winning the show of hand, and Brittan visibly offended, but demanding a poll. Sewell was proposed by John Hall, and seconded by postmaster and storekeeper Charles Wellington Bishop. Fooks was proposed by Joshua Charles Porter (a lawyer; later Mayor of Kaiapoi), and seconded by the publican Michael Hart. Whilst Sewell&#x27;s speech was well received, Fooks was laughed at and interrupted (Sewell said that Fooks did him &quot;more service than [he] could have done [him]self&quot;). The show of hands was in favour of Sewell; no more than five hands were raised in support of Fooks.

The election was held on Saturday, 20 August, between 9 am and 4 pm. The method of voting at the time was that an elector would tell the returning officer his choice of candidate. As this happened in public, a tally of the votes could be kept, and Fooks was initially ahead, but within an hour, Sewell passed him. The final result was 61 votes to 34 for Sewell, who was thus declared elected.

Sewell&#x27;s legal and financial skill was of considerable use in Parliament, although he was criticised as elitist and aloof. In terms of the political spectrum of the day, which ranged &quot;centralists&quot; against &quot;provincialists&quot;, Sewell adopted a moderate position, although he later became gradually more centralist. With regard New Zealand self-rule, the other major issue of the time, Sewell was strongly in favour. When the Acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, appointed Sewell and several other politicians as &quot;unofficial&quot; members of the Executive Council, Sewell believed that self-government would soon begin. When it became apparent that Wynyard regarded the appointments as temporary, and that he did not believe Parliament could assume responsibility for governance without royal assent, Sewell and his colleagues resigned.

===2nd Parliament and premiership===
A new Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, subsequently announced that self-government would begin with the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. Sewell once again stood for election, and was successful. Sewell was asked by the Governor to form a government, now known as the Sewell Ministry. He was appointed to the Executive Council on 18 April 1856, and became Colonial Secretary on 7 May. Dillon Bell became Colonial Treasurer (Finance Minister), Frederick Whitaker became Attorney-General, and Henry Tancred from the Legislative Council became a minister without portfolio.

Sewell&#x27;s government was short-lived, however, due to its strong centralist tendencies. The leader of the provincialist faction, William Fox, defeated Sewell&#x27;s government on 20 May 1856. Fox himself, however, did not retain office for long, being defeated by Edward Stafford, a moderate. Stafford invited Sewell to become Colonial Treasurer in the new government. In this role, Sewell was instrumental in drafting a financial compact between the central and provincial governments.

In late 1856, Sewell stepped down as Treasurer and resigned his seat, but remained an unofficial member of the Executive Council, to return to England. There, he negotiated a number of deals for New Zealand. William Richmond became Treasurer in his absence. In 1859, when Sewell returned to New Zealand, he became Treasurer once again, but stepped down again after only a month, leaving Richmond to resume the role.
In the 18 January 1860 by-election, Sewell contested the Christchurch electorate successfully against Michael Hart. He resigned towards the end of 1860 to become Registrar-General of Lands.

===Executive positions and Legislative Council===

In 1861, he was appointed by Fox to the Legislative Council, a position that he held until 1865.

When fighting broke out with Māori in 1860 over land grievances, Sewell attempted to promote negotiation and compromise. Sewell, who was a mild pacifist, believed that conflict with Māori could only properly be resolved by introducing a fair method of land purchase, one which did not involve coercion. To this end, he twice proposed a Native Council Bill, which would have created Māori-run institutions with the authority to supervise all Māori land deals. Both attempts failed. Sewell later resigned from a post as Attorney-General over the government&#x27;s land confiscation policies. Soon afterwards, he published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The New Zealand native rebellion&quot;, in which explained his views on the causes of (and solutions to) the conflict with Māori.

Later in his political career, Sewell briefly held positions as Attorney-General, Minister of Justice, and Colonial Secretary (the latter being distinct from the Premiership by this time).

During his career he represented the Town of Christchurch 1853–1856 (resigned) and 1860 (retired), and the Town of New Plymouth 1865–1866. He was defeated in 1866 for Lyttelton by Edward Hargreaves. He served on the Legislative Council from 1861 to 1865.

==Later life==
In 1873, Sewell retired from politics and returned to England shortly afterwards. He died in Cambridge on 14 May 1879 and is buried in Waresley, Huntingdonshire.

<text>Clackers (also known as Clankers, Ker-Bangers, latto-latto in the Philippines and most of Southeast Asia, and numerous other names) are toys that were popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In 1968, tempered glass sphere models emerged that could eventually shatter and injure users or others nearby. In the early 1970s, manufacturers changed them to plastic spheres suspended on each string. When they were swung up and down, banging against each other with a lot of force they made the loud &quot;clacking&quot; sound. Clackers are similar in appearance to bolas, the Argentine weapon.

The toy is formed out of two solid balls of polymer, each about in diameter, attached to a finger tab with a sturdy string. The player holds the tab with the balls hanging below and through up-and-down hand motion makes the two balls swing apart and back together, making the clacking noise that gives the toy its name. With practice one can make the balls swing so that they knock together both above and below the hand.

== History ==
The toys were created in the 1960s. Because it was &quot;addicting&quot; to some kids, millions of clackers were sold by the early 1970s.

=== Safety hazard ===

Clackers were taken off the market in the United States and Canada when reports came out of children becoming injured while playing with them. Fairly heavy and fast-moving, and made of hard acrylic plastic, the balls would occasionally shatter upon striking each other. In the United States, they were classed as a &quot;mechanical hazard&quot; in &quot;United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls&quot;.

=== Revival ===
A redesigned version of Clackers enjoyed a revival in the 1990s. The new design used modern plastics which would not shatter and two free-swinging, opposing triangles attached to a handle, with weighted balls at the ends. They are often sold in bright neon colors as noisemaker toys or party favors.

==== Egypt ====
In 2017, the original form of the toy was revived in Egypt and gained popularity among schoolchildren. It became famous under the name &quot;Sisi&#x27;s balls&quot; referring to the testicles of the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The police subsequently arrested 41 clacker sellers and confiscated 1,403 pairs of the toy which they considered offensive to the government.

=== Latto-latto ===

In late 2022, the toy became popular in Indonesia, where it is known as &quot;latto-latto&quot; or &quot;katto-katto&quot;. (&quot;Latto&quot; is a Buginese word which means a clacking sound, while &quot;katto&quot; a similar word in Makassarese.) The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo was also seen playing with the toy. Actor Paul Rudd was asked to play the toy when he visited Indonesia. 

Its popularity spread through TikTok to the neighboring Philippines in 2023, where it is known as &quot;latto-latto&quot;. There were several latto-latto competitions in Luzon, with high cash prizes. A government-launched tourism competition was held in Cainta, Rizal, with kids included. The toy was also popular in Singapore, with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong playing the toy. In 2024, the toy became popular in Pakistan.

== Description ==
Clackers were two plastic balls, each about in diameter. The balls are attached to a tab with a strong string. The player swings the balls back and forth, creating the clacking sound that describes the name.

==In popular culture==

Clackers have also made some appearances in pop culture media. Clackers are a plot point in the 1993 &quot;Love and Sausages&quot; episode of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; TV series. They were also used as weapons by Joseph Joestar in &quot;Battle Tendency&quot;, the second story arc of the 1980s manga series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;; their appearance there is anachronistic, as &quot;Battle Tendency&quot; takes place in 1938. They also reappear in the eighth story arc of the manga, &quot;JoJolion&quot;, in the final chapter released in 2021.

The toys are featured in the US television shows produced by Dan Schneider, most notably in the 2007 &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; episode &quot;Megan&#x27;s First Kiss,&quot; and in the 2008 &quot;Zoey 101&quot; episode &quot;Rumor of Love&quot;.

Clackers were also used as weapons in the 2015 Telugu film &quot;Bahubali&quot; directed by S. S. Rajamouli.

<doc id="981714" wikidata="Q2498921" url="?curid=981714" title="Virginia Hill">
<text>Virginia Hill (born Onie Virginia Hill; August 26, 1916 – March 24, 1966) was an American organized crime figure. An Alabama native, she became a Chicago Outfit courier during the mid-1930s. She was famous for being the girlfriend of mobster Bugsy Siegel.

==Early life==

Born Onie Virginia Hill on August 26, 1916, in Lipscomb, Alabama. By the time she was eight, she moved to Marietta, Georgia, with her mother and siblings after her parents separated. She attended Roberts Grammar School, where she completed eighth grade, then dropped out. In November 1931, when she was 15, she married 16-year-old George Randell.

==Association with organized crime==

In 1933, Hill left Georgia for Chicago with Randell, hoping to enter the pornography business. Once in Chicago, she separated from Randell, divorcing him the following year. She found a job as a waitress at the mob-run San Carlo Italian Village exhibit during the 1933 Century of Progress Chicago&#x27;s World Fair, and supplemented her income as a prostitute.

She came to the attention of a wealthy bookmaker and gambler, Joseph Epstein, who is said to have become her financial advisor and, possibly, lover (although Epstein was reputed to be gay). Ultimately, she entered into the Chicago Outfit crime organization. In addition to allegedly acting as a mistress to members of the Chicago Mob, she served as a courier to pass messages between mobsters. One contemporary commentator described her as:

... more than just another set of curves. She had ... a good memory, a considerable flair for hole-in-the-corner diplomacy to allay the suspicions of trigger-happy killers and a dual personality, close-lipped about essentials, and able to chatter freely, and apparently foolishly about inconsequentials.

Even law enforcement eventually concluded that she was a &quot;central clearing house&quot; for intelligence on organized crime and enjoyed an independent power base within the Mafia.

Eventually Hill became associated with Charles Fischetti, a cousin and bodyguard of Al Capone. It was Fischetti who sent her to New York to keep tabs on Luciano family capo Joe Adonis, which she did by becoming his lover. She told people that she was a Southern-belle society girl who had gone through four rich husbands, all divorced or dead, and that she had received $1 million each from their estates, but authentic socialites saw through the ruse. She built up an entourage of hangers-on and Latin gigolos hanging out on Broadway and frequently picked up the check.

While in New York, she was introduced to another Luciano associate, Bugsy Siegel, and they ended up in a hotel together that night. Later Siegel&#x27;s and Hill&#x27;s separate life paths brought them both to Hollywood, and they began a torrid affair. There were rumors that she and Siegel were secretly married in Mexico after Siegel divorced his wife Esta in 1946, but there has not been any evidence to prove the theory.

Flamingo founder Billy Wilkerson named the Flamingo, long before Benjamin Siegel got involved. Urban legend has it wrong that Siegel named the Flamingo Las Vegas resort after Hill, who liked to gamble and whose nickname was supposedly &quot;Flamingo&quot;, a moniker that Siegel was said to have given her, referring to her long, thin legs, but others have said that she was in fact short and somewhat matronly in form. Another story about the origin of the nickname said that after a few drinks, her face would flush a flamingo-like pink. However, organized crime king Lucky Luciano wrote in his memoir that Siegel once owned an interest in the Hialeah Park Race Track and viewed the local flamingo population as a good omen. The &quot;Flamingo&quot; name was given to the project at its inception by original resort financier Billy Wilkerson.

Four days before Siegel was assassinated at the home he leased for her in California (June 1947), she took an unscheduled flight to Paris, France giving rise to speculation that she was warned of Siegel&#x27;s impending murder.

In 1950, she married Hans Hauser, an Austrian skier (and head of the Sun Valley, Idaho Ski School); later giving birth to their only child, Peter Hauser (1950–1994). In 1951, she was subpoenaed to testify before the Kefauver hearings, where she denied having any knowledge of organized crime despite being described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in March of that year as the &quot;queen of the gangsters&#x27; molls&quot;. After Hill was indicted for income tax evasion in 1954, she moved to Europe, where she lived for the rest of her life with her son.

==Death and legacy==

Hill committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping pills in Koppl, near Salzburg, Austria, on March 24, 1966, at the age of 49. She is buried in Aigen Cemetery in Salzburg. According to Andy Edmonds&#x27; biography &quot;Bugsy&#x27;s Baby: The Secret Life of Mob Queen Virginia Hill&quot;, her death was suspicious despite it being an apparent suicide. The Austrian media, which were well informed about her former relationship with Siegel, speculated that she tried to get money by using her knowledge of the Italian-American Mafia. She was the subject of a 1974 television movie, in which she was portrayed by Dyan Cannon. She was played by Annette Bening in the 1991 film &quot;Bugsy&quot;, a dramatization of her relationship with Bugsy Siegel (portrayed by Warren Beatty). She was also the &quot;loose&quot; basis for Joan Crawford&#x27;s character in the 1950 film noir &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;.

<text>Frederick Emerson Peters (September 28, 1885 – July 25, 1959) was an American impostor who wrote bad checks masquerading as scholars and famous people. In an age before mass communication, few store owners bothered to ID check writers. He was born in West Salem, Ohio.

==Background==
Peters began his career of passing phony checks around 1902 when he presented himself as Theodore Roosevelt II, the son of the US president. He used fraudulent checks for his purchases, writing them to round numbers just a couple of dollars above the price of the purchase. Many of the fooled businesses were still impressed and even framed the checks as mementos.

Peters was eventually arrested in 1915 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He took charge of the prison library and used it to study various subjects to further his plans.

When he was released he took a role of antique expert &quot;R.A. Coleman&quot; of the American Peace Society. He visited antique shops ostensibly to buy items for museum collections and again rounded off checks for his &quot;commission&quot;. As &quot;J.J. Morton&quot;, he bought books for universities. By 1948 he amassed around 130 aliases.

Over the following years he impersonated real people like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Booth Tarkington and Gifford Pinchot II. He was also jailed many times, but always returned to his old activities later. Further research would be needed to clarify if he was the same Frederick Emerson Peters who on July 2, 1951, became the 22nd Ten Most Wanted Fugitive listed by the FBI, and who was then arrested by two FBI agents when they recognized him in a Washington, D.C. hotel lobby on January 15, 1952.

When asked why he kept returning to crime, Peters gave a classic response: &quot;It would require the rock-like will of the Sphynx to resist such temptation.&quot; When he was found dead in 1959, he had five checks on his pockets - all of them written for different names. Peters died on July 25, 1959, at a hotel in New Haven, Connecticut of a cerebral hemorrhage.

<doc id="981720" wikidata="Q1455960" url="?curid=981720" title="Freya radar">
<text>Freya was an early warning radar deployed by Germany during World War II; it was named after the Norse goddess Freyja. During the war, over a thousand stations were built. A naval version operating on a slightly different wavelength was also developed as the &quot;Seetakt&quot;.

==Development==
First tests of what would become the &quot;&quot;Freya&quot; were conducted in early 1937, with initial delivery of an operational radar to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1938 by the GEMA company. Freya supported an early version of Identification friend or foe (IFF). Aircraft equipped with the FuG 25a &quot;Erstling&quot;&quot; IFF system could be successfully queried across ranges of over 100 km.

The &quot;AN&quot; version gained a switchable phasing line for the antenna. Switching in the phasing line led to a phase displacement of the antenna&#x27;s radiation pattern and with that, a squinting to the left or right. This enabled the system in effect to switch from the rather broad &quot;scanning for maxima&quot; to narrow lobe switching, with an angular resolution of 0.1° achievable by a skilled operator.

The &quot;Freya&quot; radar was more advanced than its British counterpart, Chain Home. &quot;Freya&quot; operated on a wavelength (250 MHz) while Chain Home used 12 m. This allowed &quot;Freya&quot; to use a much smaller antenna system that was easier to rotate, move and position. It also offered higher resolution, allowing it to detect smaller targets. Because of its complex design, only eight &quot;Freya&quot; stations were operational when the war started, leaving large gaps between the covered areas. The British Chain Home radar, although less advanced and more prone to errors, was simpler, which meant that the complete Chain Home network was in place in time for the Battle of Britain.

== Variants ==
* FuMG 450 &quot;Freya&quot; AN, initially called FuMG 41G (range increased to 120 km)
* FuMG &quot;Freya&quot; LZ (could be disassembled for airlift)
* FuMG 480
* FuMG 44 &quot;Drehfreya&quot; (German: &quot;rotating &quot;Freya&quot;), transitional model to FuMG 44/404 (navy: FuMO371), &quot;Jagdschloss&quot;&quot; PPI radar
* FuMG 451 &quot;Freiburg&quot;, 162–200 MHz
* FuMG 321-328 (German naval designation)

==Deployment and operation==
&quot;Freya&quot; was often used in concert with the primary German gun laying radar, &quot;Würzburg Riese&quot; (&quot;Würzburg Giant&quot;); the &quot;Freya&quot; finding targets at long distances and then &quot;handing them over&quot; to the shorter-ranged Würzburgs for tracking.

Later in the war, &quot;Freya&quot; operated in the band from (120 to 130 MHz), with a pulse width of three microseconds, a peak power output of 15 to 20 kW, and a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz. It had a maximum range of only , making it inferior to Chain Home. Furthermore, it could not accurately determine altitude, but it was a fully steerable and semi-mobile system.
Freya was first successfully used on December 18, 1939 when two stations detected an approaching daytime raid on Wilhelmshaven by 22 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers at a range of 113 km and guided fighter planes toward them via radio. Only half of the Wellingtons returned to Britain undamaged, but the German fighters only reached the bombers after they had made their bombing run on ships in harbour. The performance of Freya left the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; so impressed that, by the spring of 1940, eleven &quot;Freya&quot; stations had been installed to guard Germany&#x27;s western border. After the invasion of France in 1940, additional &quot;Freya&quot; stations were built along the Atlantic coast. When Britain started its bombing raids, Hermann Göring ordered Colonel (later General) Josef Kammhuber to install an efficient air defence. This led to the so-called Kammhuber Line into which more &quot;Freya&quot; stations were incorporated. In the later course of the war, &quot;Freya&quot; devices turned out to be vulnerable to chaff, and other countermeasures, which still allowed then to be used for early warning, but no longer for guiding fighter planes. British bombing raids could also be organized such that the Kammhuber Line could be overwhelmed in massed raids.

== British intelligence ==
One of the first to give British intelligence any details about the &quot;Freya&quot; Radar was a young Danish Flight Lieutenant, Thomas Sneum, who, at great risk to his life, photographed radar installations on the Danish island of Fanø in 1941. He brought the negatives to Britain in a dramatic flight which is fictionalized in Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;Hornet Flight&quot;. Sneum&#x27;s deed is also mentioned in R. V. Jones&#x27;s &quot;Most Secret War&quot; as a &#x27;most gallant exploit&#x27; and is one of the featured stories in Courage &amp; Defiance by Deborah Hopkinson.

== Further development ==

* FuMG 401: For experiments with beam reflection on the ground, leading to a change in elevation angle, a &quot;Freya&quot; antenna array was installed on a wooden support so it could slide up and down. This enabled &quot;Freya&quot; to detect the target&#x27;s altitude without the aid of other devices (such as Würzburg radars).
* FuMG 41: To increase the range without changing the transmitter, several &quot;Freya&quot; antenna arrays were switched together in installations called &quot;Wassermann&quot;&quot; (German: Aquarius), which had greater range and were more accurate.

==Countermeasures==
To counter &quot;Freya&quot;, the British used equipment called &#x27;Moonshine&#x27;. Carried by Boulton Paul Defiant aircraft of the Special Duties Flight (later No. 515 Squadron RAF), a single set retransmitted a portion of the &quot;Freya&quot; signal amplifying the apparent return. Eight planes with &#x27;Moonshine&#x27; could mimic a force of 100 bombers. A second countermeasures system, &quot;Mandrel&quot; was a noise jammer carried by aircraft of No. 100 Group RAF which overwhelmed the signals from &quot;Freya&quot;. Individual aircraft were sent to orbit fixed positions off the enemy coast. By using nine aeroplanes, a gap could be knocked into the German&#x27;s radar coverage, while further jammers were carried in the bomber stream to counter the inland &quot;Freya&quot; network.

==Post-war use==

One FuMG 80 Freya radar, after modification, was installed in 1957/8 at the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia and served as meteorite tracking radar until 2006. Before then it was used at the Pardubice Airport, under name RZ III.

<text>Robert Vernon Toye, (b 1948?) nicknamed &quot;Blind Bob&quot; is a US bank robber who is legally blind.

== Early life ==
Toye was born in San Pedro, California and developed retinitis pigmentosa in the early age.

== Mail fraud ==
In 1968 he begin a mail scam where people would send him $5 application fee to receive work stuffing envelopes. 1973 he was sentenced for mail fraud and jailed in Springfield, Missouri.

== Bank robberies ==
In prison he heard that bank tellers in federally insured banks were instructed to hand out the money to robbers without incident. So, when Toye was released 1974, he proceeded to make his first bank robbery shortly after he had left the prison. He was armed only with his white cane and a note that claimed he had a gun.

Toye concentrated on using his right eye to see shadowy impressions of other people&#x27;s feet and followed them to the bank teller&#x27;s window. There he would flash a one-eyed jack with a text &quot;Be quick, be quiet, or you&#x27;re dead. Put all the cash in the bag. I have a gun&quot;. When he had received the money, he retreated back to the door. He used the same technique many times.

Toye was captured 1977 in New York City when he collided with armed guards that were delivering money to the bank. Next six years he spent in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. When he got out in February 1983, he went to a Citibank and stole $18,000.

Toye moved to Las Vegas but made a list of all the Citibank branches in New York. Nine times he flew to New York to rob a bank and immediately returned to Las Vegas after the robbery. He put the money in a Vegas bank account under a false name. He was arrested May 24, 1983 when he took a detour to a discount store. Toye was sentenced to 17 years and tried to escape 11 times.

In an interview for the &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1990, Toye claimed that he had given part of his loot to charity, including to retinitis pigmentosa research. At the time he had robbed 17 banks and was serving time in Lompoc Federal Penitentiary, near Santa Barbara, California, due to be released 1993.

<doc id="981723" wikidata="Q1682224" url="?curid=981723" title="Sloot Digital Coding System">
<text>The Sloot Digital Coding System is an alleged data sharing technique that its inventor claimed could store a complete digital movie file in 8 kilobytes of data— which, if true, would dramatically disprove Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem, a widely accepted principle of information theory that predicts how much data compression of a digital file is mathematically possible. The alleged technique was developed in 1995 by Romke Jan Bernhard Sloot (27 August 1945, Groningen – 11 July 1999, Nieuwegein), an electronics engineer from the Netherlands. Several demonstrations of his coding system convinced high-profile investors to join his company, but a few days before the conclusion of a contract to sell his invention, Sloot died suddenly of a heart attack. The source code was never recovered, the technique and claim have never been reproduced or verified, and the playback device he used for demonstrations was found to have contained a hard disk drive, contrary to what he told investors.

Software engineer Adam Gordon Bell postulates that Sloot may have believed in his idea because he failed to fully understand its mathematical limits, and thinking he simply needed to refine the code, he faked the demonstrations.
== Background ==
Sloot was born the youngest of three children. His father, a school headmaster, left his family quite soon after Sloot&#x27;s birth. Sloot was enrolled at a Dutch technical school, but dropped out early to work at a radio station. After fulfilling mandatory military service, Sloot settled in Utrecht with his wife. He worked briefly for Philips Electronics in Eindhoven. He left this job in 1978 after a year and a half, starting his next job in Groningen at an audio and video store. A few years later he moved to Nieuwegein where he started his own company repairing televisions and stereos.

In 1984, Sloot began focusing on computer technology such as the Philips P2000, Commodore 64, IBM PC XT, and AT. Sloot developed the idea of a countrywide repair service network called &quot;RepaBase&quot; with a database containing details on all repairs carried out. This concept was the motivation to develop alternative data storage techniques that would require significantly less space than traditional methods.

== Sloot Encoding System ==
In 1995, Sloot claimed to have developed a data encoding technique that could store an entire feature film in only 8 kilobytes (8192 bytes). For comparison, a very low-quality video file normally requires several million bytes, and a 1080p movie requires about 3 gigabytes (3,221,225,472 bytes) per hour of playing time. , the plain text of the Dutch Wikipedia page describing the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; occupies 29,000 bytes.

Roel Pieper, former CTO and board member of Philips, is quoted as saying (translated from Dutch):

Pieter Spronck rebuts Pieper&#x27;s codebook analogy by pointing out that Sloot claimed his invention was capable of encoding &quot;any&quot; video, not only those videos composed from a particular finite set of &quot;recipes&quot;.

In 1996, Sloot received an investment from colleague Jos van Rossum, a cigarette machine operator. The same year, Sloot and van Rossum were granted a 6-year Dutch patent for the Sloot Encoding System, naming Sloot as inventor and van Rossum as patent owner. The patent does not describe a compression scheme matching the claimed capabilities of the Sloot Encoding System.

Despite the impossibility of the encoding system, Sloot received further investment. In early 1999, Dutch investor Marcel Boekhoorn joined the group. In March 1999, the system was demonstrated to Pieper. Pieper resigned from Philips in May 1999 and joined Sloot&#x27;s company as CEO, which was re-branded as &quot;The Fifth Force, Inc.&quot; The story — including an account of a demonstration in which Sloot apparently recorded and replayed a randomly selected 20-minute cooking program on a single smartcard — is told in modest detail in Tom Perkins&#x27; 2007 book &quot;Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins&quot;.

== Death of Sloot ==
On July 11, 1999, Sloot was found dead, in his garden at his home in Nieuwegein, of an apparent heart attack. He died one day before the deal was to be signed with Pieper. The family consented to an autopsy, but none was performed.

Perkins, the co-founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, had agreed to invest in the technology when Sloot died. Perkins and Pieper would have proceeded after Sloot&#x27;s death, but a key piece of the technology, a compiler stored on a floppy disk, had disappeared and, despite months of searching, was never recovered.

After his death, a software engineer Sloot had worked with analysed Sloot&#x27;s demonstrations. Despite Sloot&#x27;s claim that his coding system stored all of its data on smart cards, his demonstration device was found to contain a hard disk. Bell says that Sloot seems to have believed that he had created a novel encryption technology, but posthumous analysis suggests that he had actually created a variation of shared dictionary compression, a known data compression technique with predictable and finite mathematical limitations. Bell speculates that Sloot thought he could overcome these limitations with better coding, and faked the demonstrations to buy time to improve the code, but that the inherent mathematical limitations of the coding system would have inevitably proven impossible to overcome.

<text>East Bengal Club, commonly referred to as East Bengal (), is an Indian professional multi-sports club based in Kolkata, West Bengal. It is best known for its professional men&#x27;s football team that competes in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top flight of the Indian football. It is one of the most successful football clubs in the country. The club has other departments for women&#x27;s football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cricket, field hockey, athletics and eSports.
East Bengal was founded on 1 August 1920. It first started with just its men&#x27;s football department but soon expanded into other sports such as hockey after 1947 and cricket in the 1970s. The women&#x27;s football team was started in 2001.

East Bengal is one of the most widely supported sports clubs in Asia. The club is mainly supported by the Bangals, i.e., the immigrant population from the eastern region of Bengal, who were forced to leave their homes (modern-day Bangladesh) during the partition of 1947. For those people, East Bengal Club became a source of identity and hope. The huge influx of dispossessed into the state led to a socio-economic crisis. This led to rivalries among the immigrant and native population of West Bengal, popularly named as Bangal (বাঙাল) in every sphere of life, from jobs to schools and even on football, cricket and hockey pitches. As a result, East Bengal has a long-standing rivalry with its cross-town competitors Mohun Bagan, which is mainly supported by the native population, named popularly as Ghoti (ঘটি), with whom it competes in the Kolkata derby, Asia&#x27;s biggest sports rivalry. East Bengal also shares a local rivalry with another Kolkata club, Mohammedan. The club dons the iconic red and golden yellow colours, which give it the nickname of &quot;Red and Gold Brigade and Laal Holud (লাল হলুদ)&quot;.The fans of the club are also collectively called the Torchbearers

==History==
On 28 July 1920, Jorabagan Club was scheduled to play against Mohun Bagan in the Coochbehar Cup. Jorabagan Club sent out their starting eleven but with the notable exclusion of defender Sailesh Bose, who was dropped from the squad for undisclosed reasons. The then vice-president of Jorabagan Club, Suresh Chandra Chaudhuri, asked in vain for Bose to be included in the line-up. When his request was not welcomed, Chaudhuri left the club along with Raja Manmatha Nath Chaudhuri, Ramesh Chandra Sen, and Aurobinda Ghosh. They formed East Bengal Club as a Sports and Cultural Association in the neighbourhood of Jorabagan on 1 August 1920. The name East Bengal was chosen for the newly formed club as the founders hailed from the eastern region of Bengal. Sarada Ranjan Ray took on the role of becoming the first president of this newly formed club while Suresh Chandra Chowdhury and Tarit Bhusan Roy were declared to be the first joint secretaries of the club. Soon after, Nagen Kali, M. Talukdar, B. Sen, N. Gossain, Goshto Paul (on loan from Mohun Bagan)&quot;,&quot; P. Bardhan, S. Das, S. Tagore, J. Mukherjee, Ramesh Chandra Sen, S. Bose, C. Bose, A. Roy, and A. Bannerjee were announced to be the members of the first team squad by the board.

==Crest, colours and kits==
===Crest===
In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s Satyagraha swept over India and affected football. Indian clubs boycotted the ongoing Calcutta Football League midway through the season. Amidst much confusion, Royal Regiment was declared the winner in the first division. However, East Bengal was not allowed to be promoted to the First Division. Thousands of East Bengal fans and officials decided to hold a protest march at the East Bengal Ground. It was at this march that flaming torches were carried by the protesters. And the hand holding flame torch &quot;(known as &#x27;Mawshal&#x27; or &#x27;মশাল&#x27; in Bangla)&quot; became the club emblem, which has remained to this day. In the year 2020 East Bengal released a special Centenary Crest to celebrate 100 years of its existence.
===Colours===
The primary and secondary colors of East Bengal are red and yellow respectively. Traditionally, the home kit consists of a red and yellow jersey with black shorts, while the away kit colors vary every year. These colors came about after the club was formed when the founders debated over them for the club jersey. At that time, the jerseys used to come from England. The founders, while searching, came across the red and gold color shirt hanging at the Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co. department store in Chowringhee, Kolkata. It attracted them, and they finalized the colors and jersey. It cost ₹80 in 1920, four times higher than the average. These colours permanently integrated with the club.

==Departments==

=== Men&#x27;s football ===
The men&#x27;s football team is the most distinguished and revered department of East Bengal Club. It was the original department with which the club was founded in 1920.

The club is governed by its own set of rules and regulations. Amendments and resolutions are passed via extraordinary or annual general meeting.

Currently the football rights are with a new merged entity, Emami East Bengal FC Pvt. Ltd. jointly owned by East Bengal and Emami Group who owns 77% stake of the whole club.

==Stadiums==
The club has used several stadiums at Kolkata, Howrah and Barasat, including the Eden Gardens, which has been reserved for cricket since Salt Lake Stadium opened in 1984. The first ground used by the club was Kumartuli Park in north Kolkata.

===Salt Lake Stadium===
The Salt Lake Stadium, also known as &quot;Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan&quot; (VYBK), is a multi-purpose stadium in Kolkata, built in 1984. The stadium is the largest non-auto racing in India. It is currently used mainly for football matches. The stadium includes a unique running track, long jump track, electronic scoreboard, natural turf, floodlighting arrangement, conference hall, medical room, and a doping control Room. The Salt Lake Stadium hosts the home games of East Bengal in the Indian Super League and AFC competitions. The total capacity of the stadium was 85,000, before it was changed to 68,000.

===East Bengal Ground===

The East Bengal Ground is located in Kolkata and is the club&#x27;s historical home ground. The stadium lies in the Maidan (Kolkata) area on the northern side of Fort William and near the Eden Gardens. This stadium is used mostly for Calcutta Football League matches and by the academy, women&#x27;s, and hockey teams. The total capacity of the stadium is 23,500.

=== Eden Gardens ===

The Eden Gardens is the second largest cricket stadium in India. The stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000 and formerly had a capacity of around 100,000. East Bengal has used this stadium on several occasions. For many games and seasons Eden Gardens served as the Home ground of the men&#x27;s football team before the construction of Salt Lake Stadium. After its construction the club continued to use the stadium for its cricket teams.

===Other grounds===
Barasat Stadium is also used by the club for some regional matches, especially in cases where the Salt Lake Stadium or East Bengal Ground cannot be used. Kanchenjunga Stadium, a multipurpose stadium based in Siliguri, has also been used several times to host club football matches. It also hosted the 2012 Federation Cup. Kalyani Stadium, situated on the outskirts of Kolkata at Kalyani, was used by East Bengal as their home turf during the 2019–20 I-League.

The team also trains at one of the VYBK practice grounds.

<text>The Unix Desktop Environment (UDE) is a desktop environment for the X Window System. Given its efficient and lightweight design it can be used on almost any Unix-like operating system, mostly without any porting effort.

==User interface==

UDE&#x27;s user interface philosophy is quite different from that of other desktop environments. It is designed to be used very efficiently after a short learning phase. There is no taskbar or desktop panel or equivalent. Windows lack a title bar and as such there are no buttons to close, resize, iconify or maximize windows on the window borders. These buttons are replaced by the so-called hex menu or honeycomb that appears when the user clicks on the window border (See picture).

User interaction works entirely by using the different mouse buttons on window borders and the desktop background. Combinations of mouse clicks can trigger more complex actions such as moving a window from one workspace to another or loading multiple programs (or multiple instances of a single program) at a time. For that reason, efficient usage of UDE is only possible using a three-button mouse. As of 2004, UDE offers only very basic support for keyboard shortcuts.

The window manager is uwm (unrelated to the older uwm from 1985 or previous).

<doc id="981727" wikidata="Q7122764" url="?curid=981727" title="Pacific West Conference">
<text>The Pacific West Conference (also known as the PacWest) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. Member institutions are located in California and Hawaii.

The conference sponsors the following sports: basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field outdoor for both men and women; baseball for men only; softball and volleyball for women only. The newest PacWest sports are men&#x27;s tennis and women&#x27;s golf, both added in 2012–13.

==History==
===Formation===

The PacWest was formed in 1992 when the Great Northwest Conference (a men&#x27;s conference) merged with the Continental Divide Conference (a women&#x27;s conference containing some of the same members), in response to the departures of several members and new NCAA legislation requiring conferences to have at least six members. In addition, some Hawai&#x27;i-based colleges joined the new conference.

At one point the conference expanded to 16 members, but in 2001, member schools from Washington, Alaska, California, and Oregon left to form the new Great Northwest Athletic Conference.

With the departure of the final two mainland members, Montana State University–Billings and Western New Mexico University, to join the Heartland Conference in 2005, the four Hawai&#x27;i universities played one season as “independents” after receiving a waiver from the NCAA to keep the conference in name, while searching for new members, because in order to be eligible for conference membership in the NCAA, a conference must consist of a minimum of six member institutions who sponsor at least ten sports, with two team sports for each gender.

===New PacWest Conference===
To comply with conference membership regulations, Hawai&#x27;i Pacific (HPU), Chaminade, BYU–Hawai&#x27;i and Hawai&#x27;i–Hilo added new sports to their programs. In July 2005, the Pacific West Conference voted to admit Notre Dame de Namur University as a provisional member, as it moved from the NAIA to the NCAA Division II. Grand Canyon University, formerly an NCAA D-II Independent, also joined the conference, returning the Pacific West Conference to full conference status with six members. Dixie State College of Utah joined the conference for the 2007–08 season. In 2008, it was announced that Academy of Art University would join the conference in the 2009–10 season as the conference&#x27;s 8th member. In 2009 it was announced that Dominican University of California would join the conference in the 2009–10 season as the conference&#x27;s 9th member. That same year, the conference announced it would sponsor baseball as its 11th sport, with Hawai&#x27;i Pacific University, University of Hawai&#x27;i–Hilo, Dixie State College of Utah (now Utah Tech University), and Grand Canyon University competing on a Division II level.

===Recent expansion and contraction===
The conference began expansion in 2010 when the PacWest invited California Baptist University, from the NAIA&#x27;s Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) to join the conference beginning with the 2011–12 school year. On June 1, 2011, the conference announced the additions of Azusa Pacific University, Fresno Pacific University and Point Loma Nazarene University, all members of the GSAC, which began Pacific West Conference play during the 2012–13 season. Holy Names University was also added to the PacWest in 2011, but did not begin the NCAA Division II membership process from the NAIA until July 13, 2012. As part of the transition process from NAIA to NCAA Holy Names remained ineligible for NCAA postseason play through 2015–16. On November 27, 2012, Grand Canyon announced it would leave the PacWest after the 2012–13 school year to accept an invitation to join the Division I Western Athletic Conference. In July 2016, it was announced that Biola University would join the PacWest for the 2017–18 season. In October 2016, Dixie State announced that it would transition from the PacWest to the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference after the 2017–18 school year. On January 13, 2017, California Baptist announced that it will leave the PacWest in favor of moving up to NCAA Division I. On March 23, 2020, Notre Dame de Namur announced the cessation of all its athletics after the 2019–20 school year.

<text>James Burnett, Lord Monboddo (baptised 25 October 1714 – 26 May 1799) was a Scottish judge, scholar of linguistic evolution, philosopher and deist. He is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical linguistics. In 1767 he became a judge in the Court of Session.

As such, Burnett adopted an honorary title based on the name of his father&#x27;s estate and family seat, Monboddo House. Monboddo was one of a number of scholars involved at the time in development of early concepts of biological evolution. Some credit him with anticipating in principle the idea of natural selection that was read by (and acknowledged in the writings of) Erasmus Darwin. Charles Darwin read the works of his grandfather Erasmus and later developed the ideas into a scientific theory.

==Early years==
James Burnett was born in 1714 at Monboddo House in Kincardineshire, Scotland. After his primary education at the parish school of Laurencekirk, he studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen, from where he was graduated in 1729. He then studied Civil Law at the University of Groningen for three years. He returned to Scotland to stay in Edinburgh in 1736 on the day of the Porteous Riots and got caught in the crowds, witnessing the lynching of Captain John Porteous on his first night in the city. He took examination in Civil Law at Edinburgh University in 1737 and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates.

Burnett married Elizabethe Farquharson and they had two daughters and a son. The younger daughter Elizabeth Burnett was an Edinburgh celebrity, known for her beauty and amiability, but who died of consumption (tuberculosis) at the age of 24. Burnett&#x27;s friend the Scottish poet Robert Burns, had a romantic interest in Elizabeth and wrote a poem, &quot;Elegy on The Late Miss Burnet of Monboddo&quot;, praising her beauty, which became her elegy.

Monboddo&#x27;s early work in practising law found him in a landmark piece of litigation of his time, known as the Douglas &quot;cause,&quot; or case. The matter involved the inheritance standing of a young heir, Archibald James Edward Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas, and took on the form of a mystery novel of the era, with a complex web of events spanning Scotland, France and England. Burnett, as the solicitor for the young Douglas heir, was victorious after years of legal battle and appeals.

==Later years==

From 1754 until 1767 Monboddo was one of a number of distinguished proprietors of the Canongate Theatre. He clearly enjoyed this endeavour even when some of his fellow judges pointed out that the activity might cast a shadow over his sombre image as jurist. Here he had occasion to further associate with David Hume who was a principal actor in one of the plays. He had actually met Hume earlier when Monboddo was a curator of the Advocates Library and David Hume served as keeper of that library for several years while he wrote his history.

From 1769 until 1775 John Hunter acted as his personal secretary.

In the era after Monboddo was appointed to Justice of the high court, he organised &quot;learned suppers&quot; at his house on 13 St John Street, off the Canongate in Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town, where he discussed and lectured about his theories. Local intellectuals were invited to attend attic repasts. Henry Home, Lord Kames was conspicuously absent from such socialising; while Kames and Monboddo served on the high court at the same time and had numerous interactions, they were staunch intellectual rivals. Monboddo rode to London on horseback each year and visited Hampton Court as well as other intellectuals of the era; the King himself was fond of Monboddo&#x27;s colourful discussions. 

Monboddo died at home 13 St John Street in the Canongate district of Edinburgh on 26 May 1799 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh along with his daughter Elizabeth where they have unmarked graves in the burial enclosure of Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies (within the non-public section known as the Covenanters Prison).

==Historical linguistics==

In &quot;The Origin and Progress of Language&quot;, originally published in six volumes from 1774 to 1792, Burnett analysed the structure of languages and argued that humans had evolved language skills in response to changing environments and social structures. Burnett was the first to note that some languages create lengthy words for rather simple concepts. He reasoned that in early languages there was an imperative for clarity so redundancy was built in and seemingly unnecessary syllables added. He concluded that this form of language evolved when clear communication might be the determinant of avoiding danger.

Monboddo studied languages of peoples colonised by Europeans, including those of the Carib, Eskimo, Huron, Algonquian, Peruvian (Quechua?) and Tahitian peoples. He saw the preponderance of polysyllabic words, whereas some of his predecessors had dismissed these languages as a series of monosyllabic grunts. He also observed that in Huron (or Wyandot) the words for very similar objects are astoundingly different. This fact led Monboddo to perceive that these people needed to communicate reliably regarding a more limited number of subjects than in modern civilisations, which led to the polysyllabic and redundant nature of many words. He also came up with the idea that these languages are generally vowel-rich and that correspondingly, languages such as German and English are vowel-starved. According to Burnett, this disparity partially arises from the greater vocabulary of Northern European languages and the decreased need for polysyllabic content.

Monboddo also popularized Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn&#x27;s 17th-century theory of a &quot;Skythian&quot; proto-language, traced the evolution of modern European languages and gave particularly great effort to understanding the ancient Greek language, in which he was proficient. He argued that Greek is the most perfect language ever established because of its complex structure and tonality, rendering it capable of expressing a wide gamut of nuances. Monboddo was the first to formulate what is now known as the single-origin hypothesis, the theory that all human origin was from a single region of the earth; he reached this conclusion by reasoning from linguistic evolution (Jones, 1789). This theory is evidence of his thinking on the topic of the evolution of Man.

Joshua Steele&#x27;s disagreement, and subsequent correspondence, with Monboddo over details of the &quot;melody and measure of speech&quot; resulted in Steele&#x27;s &quot;Prosodia Rationalis&quot;, a foundational work both in phonetics and in the analysis of verse rhythm.

==Evolutionary theorist==
Monboddo is considered by some scholars as a precursive thinker in the theory of evolution. However, some modern evolutionary historians do not give Monboddo an equally high standing in the influence of history of evolutionary thought.

:&quot;Monboddo: Scottish jurist and pioneer anthropologist who explored the origins of language and society and anticipated principles of Darwinian evolution.&quot;

:&quot;With some wavering, he extended Rousseau&#x27;s doctrine of the identity of species of man and the chimp into the hypothesis of common descent of all the anthropoids, and suggested by implication a general law of evolution.&quot; Lovejoy.

Charles Neaves, one of Monboddo&#x27;s successors on the high court of Scotland, believed that proper credit was not given to Monboddo in evolutionary theory development. Neaves wrote in verse:
&lt;poem&gt;Though Darwin now proclaims the law
And spreads it far abroad, O!
The man that first the secret saw
Was honest old Monboddo.
The architect precedence takes
Of him that bears the hod, O!
So up and at them, Land of Cakes,
We&#x27;ll vindicate Monboddo.&lt;/poem&gt;

Erasmus Darwin notes Monboddo&#x27;s work in his publications (Darwin 1803). Later writers consider Monboddo&#x27;s analysis as precursive to the theory of Evolution. Whether Charles Darwin read Monboddo is not certain. Monboddo debated with Buffon regarding man&#x27;s relationship to other primates. Charles Darwin did not mention Monboddo, but commented on Buffon: &quot;the first author who in modern times has treated [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon&quot;. Buffon thought that man was a species unrelated to lower primates, but Monboddo rejected Buffon&#x27;s analysis and argued that the anthropoidal ape must be related to the species of man: he sometimes referred to the anthropoidal ape as the &quot;brother of man&quot;. Monboddo suffered a setback, in his standing on evolutionary thought, because he stated at one time that men had caudal appendages (tails); some historians failed to take him very seriously after that remark, even though Monboddo was known to bait his critics with preposterous sayings.

Bailey&#x27;s &quot;The Holly and the Horn&quot; states that &quot;Charles Darwin was to some degree influenced by the theories of Monboddo, who deserves the title of Evolutionist more than that of Eccentric.&quot; Henderson says:
:&quot;He [Monboddo] was a minor celebrity in Edinburgh because he was considered to be very eccentric. But he actually came up with the idea that men may have evolved instead of being created by God. His views were dismissed because people thought he was mad, and in those days it was a very controversial view to hold. But he felt it was a logical possibility and it caused him a great deal of consternation. He actually did not want to believe the theory because he was a very religious person.&quot;

Monboddo may be the first person to associate language skills evolving from primates and continuing to evolve in early humans (Monboddo, 1773). He wrote about how the language capability has altered over time in the form not only of skills but physical form of the sound producing organs (mouth, vocal cords, tongue, throat), suggesting he had formed the concept of evolutionary adaptive change.

He also elaborates on the advantages created by the adaptive change of primates to their environment and even to the evolving complexity of primate social structures. In 1772 in a letter to James Harris, Monboddo articulated that his theory of language evolution (Harris 1772) was simply a part of the manner that man had advanced from the lower animals, a clear precedent of evolutionary thought. Furthermore, he established a detailed theory of how man adaptively acquired language to cope better with his environment and social needs. He argued that the development of language was linked to a procession of events: first developing use of tools, then social structures and finally language. This concept was quite striking for his era, because it departed from the classical religious thinking that man was created instantaneously and language revealed by God. In fact, Monboddo was deeply religious and pointed out that the creation events were probably simply allegories and did not dispute that the universe was created by God. Monboddo was a vigorous opponent of other scientific thinking that philosophically questioned the role of God (see Monboddo&#x27;s prolific diatribes on Newton&#x27;s theories).

As an agriculturist and horse-breeder, Monboddo was quite aware of the significance of selective breeding and even transferred this breeding theory to communications he had with James Boswell in Boswell&#x27;s selection of a mate. Monboddo has stated in his own works that degenerative qualities can be inherited by successive generations and that by selective choice of mates, creatures can improve the next generation in a biological sense. This suggests that Monboddo understood the role of natural processes in evolution; artificial selection was the starting-point for many of the proto-evolutionary thinkers, and for Darwin himself.

Monboddo struggled with how to &quot;get man from an animal&quot; without divine intervention. This is typical of the kind of thinking which is called &quot;deist&quot;. He developed an entire theory of language evolution around the Egyptian civilisation to assist in his understanding of how man descended from animals, since he explained the flowering of language upon the spinoff of the Egyptians imparting language skills to other cultures. Monboddo cast early humans as wild, solitary, herbivorous quadrupeds. He believed that contemporary people suffered many diseases because they were removed from the environmental state of being unclothed and exposed to extreme swings in climate.

Burnett wrote of numerous cultures (mostly based upon accounts of explorers); for example, he described &quot;insensibles&quot; and &quot;wood eaters&quot; in &quot;Of the Origin and Progress of Language&quot;. He was fascinated by the nature of these peoples&#x27; language development and also how they fit into the evolutionary scheme.

Against all this, Monboddo&#x27;s contribution to evolution is today regarded by historians of evolution as being notable.

Bowler acknowledges his argument that apes might represent the earliest form of humanity (Monboddo 1774), but continues:
:&quot;He [Monboddo] regarded humans (including savages and apes) as quite distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom. The first suggestion that the human species was descended via the apes from the lower animals did not come until Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot; of 1809.&quot;

Charles Dickens knew of Monboddo and wrote in his novel, Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit about &quot;(...) the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys&quot;. This is significant because &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; was published (1843) years before Darwin&#x27;s On the Origin of Species (1859).

The history of the theory of evolution is a relatively modern field of scholarship.

==Metaphysics==
In &quot;Antient Metaphysics&quot;, Burnett claimed that man is gradually elevating himself from the animal condition to a state in which mind acts independently of the body. He was a strong supporter of Aristotle in his concepts of Prime Mover. Much effort was devoted to crediting Isaac Newton with brilliant discoveries in the Laws of Motion, while defending the power of the mind as outlined by Aristotle. His analysis was further complicated by his recurring need to assure that Newton did not obviate the presence of God.

==Nudism==

Monboddo was a pioneer in regard to many modern ideas and had already in the eighteenth century realized the value of &quot;air-baths&quot; (the familiar term which he invented) to mental and physical health. In his writings Monboddo argued against clothes as unnatural and undesirable from every point of view for both mind and body. Monboddo &quot;awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking an air bath.&quot; When nudism was first brought into fashion with much enthusiasm in Germany as Freikörperkultur early in the twentieth century Monboddo was regarded as a pioneer, and in 1913 a &quot;Monboddo Bund&quot; was established in Berlin, for the harmonious culture of body and mind.

==Eccentricity==
Burnett was widely known to be an eccentric. Habitually he rode on horseback between Edinburgh and London instead of journeying by carriage. Another time after a decision went against him regarding the value of a horse, he refused to sit with the other judges and assumed a seat below the bench with the court clerks. When Burnett was visiting the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in London in 1787, part of the floor of the courtroom started to collapse. People rushed out of the building but Burnett who, at the age of 71, was partially deaf and shortsighted, was the only one not to move. When he was later asked for a reason, he stated that he thought it was &quot;an annual ceremony, with which, as an alien, he had nothing to do&quot;.

Burnett in his earlier years suggested that the orangutan was a form of man, although some analysts think that some of his presentation was designed to entice his critics into debate.
The orangutan was at this time a generic term for all types of apes. The Swedish explorer whose evidence Burnett accepted was a naval officer who had viewed a group of monkeys and thought they were human. Burnett may simply have taken the view that it was reasonable for people to assume the things they do and the word of a naval officer trained to give accurate reports was a credible source. Burnett was indeed responsible for changing the classical definition of man as a creature of reason to a creature capable of achieving reason, although he viewed this process as one slow and difficult to achieve.

At one time he said that humans must have all been born with tails, which were removed by midwives at birth. His contemporaries ridiculed his views, and by 1773 he had retracted this opinion (Pringle 1773). Some later commentators have seen him as anticipating evolutionary theory. He appeared to argue that animal species adapted and changed to survive, and his observations on the progression of primates to man amounted to some kind of concept of evolution. Burnett also examined feral children and was the only thinker of his day to accept them as human rather than monsters. He viewed in these children the ability to achieve reason. He identified the orangutan as human, as his sources indicated it was capable of experiencing shame.

==In popular culture==
In Thomas Love Peacock&#x27;s 1817 novel &quot;Melincourt&quot;, an orangutan punningly named &quot;Sir Oran Haut-Ton&quot; becomes a candidate for British Parliament based on Monboddo&#x27;s theories.

Charles Dickens, in his novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, refers to &quot;the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys&quot;.

In his 1981 dystopian novel &quot;Lanark&quot;, Alasdair Gray names the head of the mysterious Institute Lord Monboddo. He makes the connection explicit in a marginal note, adding that it is not a literal depiction.

Lord Monboddo&#x27;s descendant, Jamie Burnett of Leys, has sponsored a stage work &quot;Monboddo – The Musical&quot; which is a biographical re-enactment of the life of his ancestor. It received a first run at Aberdeen Arts Centre in September 2010.

In her short story &quot;The Monboddo Ape Boy&quot;, Lillian de la Torre depicted a slightly fictionalised Monboddo meeting Samuel Johnson, and being presented with a supposed &quot;wild boy&quot;.

<text>Stephen James Napier Tennant (21 April 1906 – 28 February 1987) was a British socialite known for his decadent, eccentric lifestyle. He was a central member of the socialite group referred to as &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; by the tabloid press of the time. Tennant was noted for his affected demeanor, appearance and behaviours.

==Early life==
Tennant was born into British nobility, the youngest son of a Scottish peer, Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner, and the former Pamela Wyndham, one of the Wyndham sisters and of The Souls clique. His mother was also a cousin of Lord Alfred Douglas (1870–1945), Oscar Wilde&#x27;s lover and a sonneteer. On his father&#x27;s death, Tennant&#x27;s mother married Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a fellow bird-lover. Tennant&#x27;s eldest brother Edward – &quot;Bim&quot; – was killed in the First World War. His elder brother David Tennant founded the Gargoyle Club in Soho.

===Social set===
During the 1920s and 1930s, Tennant was an important member – the &quot;Brightest&quot;, it is said – of the &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;. His friends included Rex Whistler, Cecil Beaton, the Sitwells, Lady Diana Manners and the Mitford girls. He is widely considered to be the model for Cedric Hampton in Nancy Mitford&#x27;s novel &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, one of the inspirations for Lord Sebastian Flyte in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, and a model for the Hon. Miles Malpractice in some of Waugh&#x27;s other novels.

==Writing==
For most of his life, Tennant tried to start or finish a novel – &quot;Lascar: A Story You Must Forget&quot;. It is popularly believed that he spent the last 17 years of his life in bed at the house he inherited from his parents, Wilsford House at Wilsford cum Lake, Wiltshire, which he had redecorated by Syrie Maugham. 

Though undoubtedly idle, he was not truly lethargic: he made several visits to the United States and Italy, and developed many new friendships. His later reputation as a recluse became increasingly true only towards the last years of his life. Yet even then, his life was not uneventful: he became landlord to V. S. Naipaul, who immortalised Tennant in his novel &quot;The Enigma of Arrival&quot;.

==Personal life==
During the 1920s and 1930s Tennant had a long time sexual affair with the poet Siegfried Sassoon. Prior to this he had proposed to a friend, Elizabeth Lowndes, but had been rejected (Philip Hoare relates how Tennant discussed plans with Lowndes about bringing his nanny with them on their honeymoon). 

His relationship with Sassoon (twenty years his senior), however, was to be his most important: it lasted some six years before Tennant off-handedly put an abrupt end to it and Sassoon was reportedly devastated. 

When Tennant died in 1987, he had outlived most of his contemporaries. A large archive of his letters, scrapbooks, personal ephemera and artworks is held in The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History in Hackney, London.

== In popular culture ==
The character of Cedric Hampton in the novel &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; is based on Tennant.

The character of Miles Malpractice in the novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; is based on Tennant.

Lord Sebastian Flyte, a character in the novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, is partly based on Tennant.

The narrator of Shola von Reinhold&#x27;s novel &quot;LOTE&quot; (2020) is obsessed (&quot;transfixed&quot;) with Tennant, and mentions him throughout the book.

He was played as a younger man by Calam Lynch and as an older man by Anton Lesser in the 2021 Terence Davies film &quot;Benediction&quot;.

<doc id="981738" wikidata="Q5124630" url="?curid=981738" title="Civil War gold hoax">
<text>The Civil War Gold Hoax, also known as the Bogus Proclamation of 1864 was an 1864 unsuccessful financial hoax perpetrated during the American Civil War by American journalists Joseph Howard Jr. and Francis Mallison of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;. Howard and Mallson hoped to exploit uncertainty about the ongoing war and trigger a sudden financial panic and profit from it. The conspirators bought gold on margin and then attempted to circulate a false proclamation from President Abraham Lincoln among New York newspapers, that called for a national day of prayer and the conscription of 400,000 additional men into the Union army. Howard and Mallison hoped that this proclamation would lead investors to believe that the Lincoln administration thought the war was going poorly, and cause them to abandon the Union greenback currency and instead buy gold, driving up its price. With the price of gold artificially inflated, the conspirators could sell high and make a considerable amount of money, before anyone realized the proclamation was a forgery.

Misunderstanding the hoax as an intelligence leak Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton ordered two newspapers to be closed, and numerous reporters and telegraph personnel arrested. Military authorities in New York City quickly discovered the fraudulent nature of the proclamation and arrested both fraudsters within days of the attempted hoax. The reporters and telegraph personnel were soon released while Howard remained in jail until August, and Mallison until September. While they were imprisoned Lincoln released a similar proclamation to Howard and Mallison&#x27;s fraudulent one, which called for 500,000 new volunteers for the Union army.

== Hoax ==
During the evening of May 17 a young accomplice of Howard and Mallsion delivered forged Associated Press dispatches announcing the proclamation to several New York City newspapers. The purpose of the late-night drop off was to get the proclamation printed as a breaking story that night editors would be eager to insert into the next day&#x27;s paper, but would have little time to check its validity. The delivery boy failed to drop off the notice at the offices of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; however, and when employees at the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot; discovered this they became suspicious and opted not to publish it. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; published it at first, but when the editor there realized that neither of the other two major papers, the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot;, had published it, they became suspicious and pulled the proclamation from its pages, destroying thousands of copies which carried the fake document. As a result, only two newspapers, the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot; and the &quot;New York World&quot; printed the proclamation in their morning editions on May 18, 1864.

When editors at the &quot;Journal&quot; and &quot;World&quot; realized on the morning of May 18 that no other papers had published the announcement from the president they realized they had been fooled and began to recall their papers. The financial nature of the hoax was soon uncovered by General John Dix, and Secretary of State William Seward issued an announcement that afternoon denouncing the proclamation as a fake. Howard and Mallison were eventually arrested on May 21. Howard remained imprisoned until August 23, when Lincoln ordered he be released at the behest of Howard&#x27;s family friend Henry Ward Beecher. Mallison remained in jail another month, until Lincoln ordered him released on September 20 after Mallison wrote him an appeal expressing &quot;sincere regret at my folly.&quot;

In the immediate wake of the publication of the proclamation on May 18, the Lincoln administration reacted with uncharacteristically harsh measures. The president ordered General Dix to arrest Manton Marble and William Prime, editors of the &quot;World&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; respectively, and to occupy their newspaper offices with federal troops. Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton went on to order the arrest of the New York staff of the Independent Telegraph Company, and closed the company offices in Baltimore, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. The Washington company offices were also closed and searched, and the superintendent was interrogated and imprisoned. The next day Edwin Stanton also had several journalists in Washington arrested; Henry Villard, Adams Sherman Hill, and Horace White. Marble and Prime were released on May 21, and their papers resumed publishing on May 23. The telegraph closings were also rescinded after several days, and the telegraph staff, along with the unfortunate Washington reporters were released.

The cause of the harsh measures the Lincoln administration took in the wake of the hoax appears to be that Lincoln and Stanton believed that the proclamation was the result of a major security breach. By complete coincidence, at the same time Howard and Mallison were concocting a false proclamation calling for 400,000 new soldiers, Lincoln was drafting a genuine proclamation that would also call for hundreds of thousands of new soldiers. Upon hearing of the fake proclamation Lincoln and some of his cabinet thought it suspiciously similar to the unannounced proclamation they were considering and concluded someone had leaked it to the opposition press (the &quot;World&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; were notorious critics of Lincoln). The widespread arrests among journalists, telegraph operators, and newspaper publishers were therefore an attempt to catch whoever had leaked the President&#x27;s announcement, and were released once Lincoln and his cabinet were satisfied there had been no such leak. Lincoln eventually released his genuine proclamation calling for 500,000 new volunteers for the army on July 18.

<text>Josephine Clofullia (1829–1870) was a famous Swiss-born bearded lady who is most famous for being part of P. T. Barnum&#x27;s &quot;American Museum.&quot;

==Early life==
Madame Clofullia, as she was often billed, was born Josephine Boisdechêne in Versoix, Switzerland to Brigadier Joseph Boisdechêne and Françoise Masset. She was born hairy and reputedly had a two-inch beard at the age of eight.

At eight, she was sent to boarding school in Geneva to be educated by the same institution as her mother. When she was fourteen, her mother died shortly after the death of her fifth child, and her father removed her from the school.

==Personal life==
Josephine gave birth to two children; the first, a girl named Zelea, born in December 1851, died eleven months later. Her son Albert, who was born in December 1852, was also born with a layer of hair.

While comfortable in her home village, in many places when going out in public she would wear a handkerchief over the lower half of her face to not provoke attention or be accused of being a man in women&#x27;s clothing.

==Touring career==

In 1849, at the age of twenty, she began to tour Europe, first accompanied by her father and an agent and then with her father alone. In Paris she met painter Fortune Clofullia and eventually married him. She is notorious for fashioning her beard to imitate that of Napoleon III. In return, the ruler gave her a large diamond.

By early 1851 she had taken up residence in London, to take part in the Great Universal Exposition. where she visited Charing Cross Hospital to discuss her unusual medical condition, and was the following year the subject of an article for The Lancet.

In 1853, Clofullia, her husband, her son, and her father moved to the United States where they were introduced to P. T. Barnum. Barnum offered her a position at his American Museum, and she debuted there in March, 1853 as &quot;The Bearded Lady of Geneva.&quot; For a period during her nine-month tenure her son was also featured as an attraction, where he was dubbed &quot;Infant Esau&quot;, after the biblical character. Variations on this title would also later be used for other performers under Barnum, such as Annie Jones and Grace Gilbert.

Clofullia then entered into a new contract with Colonel J. H. Wood, the owner of Col. Wood&#x27;s Museum, and toured through several U.S. States. By 1854, she was working in Havana, Cuba.

==Lawsuit==
In July 1853 William Charr took Clofullia to court, claiming that she was actually a man and an impostor. During the case doctors examined her and verified that she was a female and the case was eventually dismissed. By hearsay it has been suspected that Barnum arranged the whole matter himself as a publicity stunt.

==Later life and death==
In 1870 she was being exhibited at St. Matthews Fair in the town of Bridgwater, England. In late September, Josephine became ill and whilst recovering in the Bridgwater Workhouse Hospital, she died. Her cause of death was listed on her death certificate as a &quot;low fever.&quot; She is buried in the paupers section of Wembdon Road Cemetery, Bridgwater.

<text>Annie Jones Elliot (July 14, 1865 October 22, 1902) was an American bearded woman, born in Virginia. She toured with showman P. T. Barnum as a circus attraction. Whether the cause of her condition was hirsutism or an unrelated genetic condition that affects children of both sexes and continues into adult years is unknown. Many photographers, including Mathew Brady, took her portraits during her lifetime, which were widely distributed. As an adult, Jones became the country&#x27;s top &quot;bearded lady&quot; and acted as a spokesperson for Barnum&#x27;s &quot;Freaks&quot;, a word she tried to abolish from the business. Jones married Richard Elliot in 1881, but divorced him in 1895 for her childhood sweetheart William Donovan, who died, leaving Jones a widow. In 1902, Jones died in Brooklyn of tuberculosis.

==Biography==
Annie Jones was born in Marion, Virginia, the county seat of Smyth County, in the southwestern end of the Commonwealth, on July 14, 1865. When Jones joined P. T. Barnum&#x27;s exhibition as a child of only nine months, Jones&#x27; parents received a $150-a-week salary. She was billed as a new &quot;infant Esau&quot;. By the age of five, she had a mustache, sideburns, and beard, and became well known as the &quot;Bearded Girl&quot;. Photographer Mathew Brady took Jones&#x27; portrait as a child in 1865. A number of additional portraits were taken of Jones during her lifetime and were widely distributed.

When she was about five years old, Jones went touring with Barnum&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, appearing in the circus sideshow and also in dime museums. When she was 16, Jones married a barker named Richard Elliot. They divorced 15 years later, and Jones subsequently married William Donovan, who worked in the show&#x27;s wardrobe. They toured Europe, but then Donovan died a few years later and Jones re-joined Barnum&#x27;s circus.

In an incident which may have been one of Barnum&#x27;s publicity stunts, a New York phrenologist kidnapped Jones when she was a young child. Barnum and the police found her exhibited in a church fair. When the man claimed the child as his, the matter went to court. The judge had Jones separated from the others before it was her time to testify. When the child was taken to the courtroom, she went straight to her parents when she saw them. The judge declared the case closed.

<text>Clémentine Delait (5 March 1865 – 5 April 1939) was a French bearded lady who kept a café. She has been described by contemporaries as &quot;the most illustrious and celebrated bearded lady in France&quot; and &quot;the perfect example of a bearded lady&quot;.

== Early life ==
Clémentine Delait was born in 1865 in Thaon-les-Vosges, in Lorraine, France. At the age of 20 she married Paul Delait, a local baker, with whom she opened a café in town. 

According to later accounts, Clémentine Delait was hirsute from an early age, but shaved regularly. This changed in 1900, when she visited a carnival and saw a bearded woman with an unimpressive stubble and boasted that she could grow a better beard herself. Her husband bet 500 francs to back her. The bet attracted many more customers to the Delaits&#x27; café and they changed the name to &quot;Le Café de La Femme à Barbe&quot;, &quot;The café of the Bearded Woman&quot;.

== Fame ==
Delait began selling photographs and postcards of herself and became something of a celebrity. She began touring Europe, attracting great crowds in Paris and London. Her touring intensified after she became a widow in 1926.

In 1900 she took part in much publicized stunt during which she entered a lion cage and played cards with the lion tamer while inside, as legend has it, scaring the lions in the process. In 1904 she received special permission from the authorities to wear men&#x27;s clothes at her leisure, at a time when it was illegal for women to wear masculine garb. 

By all accounts, she was very proud of her beard and took great care of it. Charles Grossier, her former barber, claimed that Delait would &quot;watch him like a hawk&quot; whenever he trimmed her beard. Grossier visited her three times per week to wash her beard with a special shampoo and claimed that &quot;she took care of that beard, she washed it, she clucked over, she brushed it every day&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In the 1970s a museum dedicated to Clémentine Delait was opened in Thaon-les-Vosges.

<doc id="981746" wikidata="Q111940505" url="?curid=981746" title="Caret (proofreading)">
<text>The caret () is a V-shaped grapheme, usually inverted and sometimes extended, used in proofreading and typography to indicate that additional material needs to be inserted at the point indicated in the text. The same symbol is also used as a diacritical mark modifying another character (as in ), for which purpose it is known as a circumflex.

==Usage==
The caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a proofreading mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document. The term comes from the Latin word , &quot;it lacks&quot;, from , &quot;to lack; to be separated from; to be free from&quot;. The caret symbol can be written just below the line of text for a punctuation mark at low line position, such as a comma, or just above the line of text as an inverted caret () for a character at a higher line position, such as an apostrophe, or in either position to indicate insertion of a letter, word or phrase; the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.

<text>Richard Lydekker (; 25 July 1849 – 16 April 1915) was an English naturalist, geologist and writer of numerous books on natural history.

==Biography==
Richard Lydekker was born at Tavistock Square in London. His father was Gerard Wolfe Lydekker, a barrister-at-law with Dutch ancestry. The family moved to Harpenden Lodge soon after Richard&#x27;s birth. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first-class in the Natural Science tripos (1872). In 1874 he joined the Geological Survey of India and made studies of the vertebrate palaeontology of northern India (especially Kashmir). He remained in this post until the death of his father in 1881. His main work in India was on the Siwalik palaeofauna; it was published in &quot;Palaeontologia Indica&quot;. He was responsible for the cataloguing of the fossil mammals, reptiles, and birds in the Natural History Museum (10 vols., 1891).

He named a variety of taxa including the golden-bellied mangabey; as a taxon authority he is named simply as &quot;Lydekker&quot;.

==Biogeography==

He was influential in the science of biogeography. In 1896 he delineated the biogeographical boundary through Indonesia, known as Lydekker&#x27;s Line, that separates Wallacea on the west from Australia-New Guinea on the east. It follows the edge of the Sahul Shelf, an area from New Guinea to Australia of shallow water with the Aru Islands on its edge. Along with Wallace&#x27;s Line and others, it indicates the definite effect of geology on the biogeography of the region, something not seen so clearly in other parts of the world.

==First cuckoo==
Lydekker attracted amused public attention with a pair of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1913, when he wrote on 6 February that he had heard a cuckoo, contrary to Yarrell&#x27;s &quot;History of British Birds&quot; which doubted the bird arrived before April. Six days later on 12 February 1913, he wrote again, confessing that &quot;the note was uttered by a bricklayer&#x27;s labourer&quot;. Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper.

==Awards==
He received the Lyell Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1902.

<text>Jane Barnell (January 3, 1879 – July 21, 1945) was an American bearded lady who worked in circus sideshows, dime museums and carnivals, who used various stage names including Princess Olga, Madame Olga and Lady Olga. In her only film role in Tod Browning&#x27;s cult classic &quot;Freaks&quot;, using the sideshow stage name Olga Roderick, she was billed as the &quot;Bearded Lady&quot;.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Jane Barnell was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to George W. Barnell, a Russian Jewish itinerant wagon maker, and his wife, a woman of Irish and Catawban ancestry. When she applied for her social security card in May 1939, she gave her parents as George Barnell and Nancy Shaw. Her mother&#x27;s name is not mentioned in the interviews she gave. She was their second child, and she had three sisters and two brothers. She was named after her maternal grandmother. Her mother was from York County, South Carolina. By two years of age, she was capable of growing a beard. Her mother thought she was cursed and took her to hoodoo doctors and other folk healers to remove her condition.

===Career===
Barnell&#x27;s mother sold the 4-year-old Jane to the Great Orient Family Circus and Menagerie while her father was away on business in Baltimore. The circus consisted of the Muslim woman who worked as manager, two of her daughters who danced, and three sons who juggled and were tight rope walkers. Jane toured with the circus for several months around the South before the circus went to New Orleans, left for Europe, and took her with them. In Europe, the circus toured with a German circus. She fell ill with typhoid fever in Berlin. She was placed in a charity hospital and later in an orphanage. She was later found by her father by the time she was five. He had either tracked the circus from the Carolinas to Germany, or the woman who ran the circus had the Berlin police contact the sheriff of Wilmington.

After that incident, Barnell was placed in the care of her Catawban grandmother who lived in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. She began to shave in order to conceal her condition. Her grandmother told her stories about Florence Nightingale, which inspired her to work as a student nurse in the old city hospital at Wilmington when she turned 17. She worked there for about a year until an unpleasant incident occurred that made her believe she would never have a normal life. She returned to her grandmother&#x27;s farm. In spring 1892, she met a circus performer, Professor William Heckler, who talked her into stopping shaving and got her employment with John Robinson&#x27;s Circus. She tried several stage names before eventually settling on Lady Olga Roderick. At that time, her beard was 13 inches long. She went back to North Carolina every winter until her grandmother died in 1899. She worked with the Robinson circus for fourteen years.

At some point during her life, Barnell worked as a trapeze artist before having a railroad accident that ended her career. She then became a commercial photographer.

Barnell toured for a time with a number of circuses, including the Ringling Brothers circus, and later joined Hubert&#x27;s Museum in Times Square, New York City. She appeared in a Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932) which, according to the DVD documentary, left her unhappy with the overall portrayal of the sideshow performers in the film.

In April 1935, she was working at the Ringling Brothers&#x27; sideshow at Madison Square Garden.

In 1940, she was interviewed by Joseph Mitchell for an article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His interview is one of the few sources that exists about her life.

Her date and place of death has been erroneously reported online as October 26, 1951. That date comes from some researchers confusing her death with that of a Susan Jane Barnell. When approached by Diane Arbus about information regarding her death, Joseph Mitchell verified her passing.

Barnell died on July 21, 1945, in Manhattan. Her remains were cremated by the New York and New Jersey Cremation Company.

== Personal life ==
Barnell was married four times. Her first marriage was to a German musician who played in the band for John Robinson&#x27;s Circus. She had two children with him. Her husband and their two children died within several years. Her second husband was a balloonist who was killed months after their marriage. Her third marriage was to an alcoholic whom she divorced. Her last marriage, in 1931, was to her manager Thomas O&#x27;Boyle, an orphan ex-circus clown and a sideshow talker for Hubert&#x27;s Dime Museum. She had little contact with her family after she became a performer. She believed they thought she was a disgrace. By 1940, she claimed to have not seen her siblings in 22 years and believed them to be dead. One of her sisters worked as a nurse helping blind Chinese children.

In April 1935, she gave a slightly different account of her personal life when interviewed by Ruth McKenney. She claimed that she had been married thrice; the first time when she was fourteen; the second time when she was nineteen; and then to her husband of four years Thomas O&#x27;Boyle.

<text>Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty (28 February 1898 – 30 October 1963) was an Irish Catholic priest, a senior official of the Roman Curia and a significant figure in the Catholic resistance to Nazism. During the Second World War, O&#x27;Flaherty was responsible for saving 6,500 Allied soldiers and Jews. His ability to evade the traps set by the German &quot;Gestapo&quot; and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) Chief Herbert Kappler earned him the nickname &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican&quot;.

After the war, he was named a papal domestic prelate by Pope Pius XII and served as notary of the Holy Office. He worked alongside and closely assisted Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani until 1960. Prior to being incapacitated by a stroke in that same year, O&#x27;Flaherty was about to be removed from all his Curia positions and &quot;promoted&quot; by Pope John XXIII to Papal Nuncio to Tanzania. He returned to his native Ireland, where he died in 1963.

Despite O&#x27;Flaherty and Delia Murphy&#x27;s joint role in helping to save more than 5,000 Jewish lives through their Rome Escape Line network during the Holocaust in Italy, Anglo-Irish and Protestant nurse Mary Elmes still remains the only Irish person honoured as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.

==Early life==
Shortly after Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s birth in Lisrobin, Kiskeam, County Cork, his parents, James and Margaret, moved to Killarney. The family lived on the golf course, and James O&#x27;Flaherty worked there as a steward. By his late teens, young O&#x27;Flaherty had a scratch handicap and a scholarship to a teacher training college.

However, in 1918, he enrolled at Mungret College, a Jesuit college in County Limerick dedicated to preparing young men for missionary priesthood. Normally, students ranged from 14 to 18 years. When O&#x27;Flaherty came in, he was a little older than most of the students, at about 20. The college allowed for some older people to come in if they had been accepted by a bishop who would pay for them.

O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s sponsor was the Bishop of Cape Town, Bernard Cornelius O&#x27;Riley, in whose diocese he expected to be posted after ordination, a major step for a young man who had never set foot outside of Munster. When O&#x27;Flaherty was in Mungret, the Irish War for Independence was ongoing. He was posted to Rome in 1922 to finish his studies and was ordained on 20 December 1925. He never joined his diocese, however, but he stayed to work for the Holy See and served as a Vatican diplomat in Egypt, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Czechoslovakia. In 1934, he was appointed a papal chamberlain with the title of &quot;Monsignor&quot;. He was originally ascribed to the Sacred Congregation De Propaganda Fide through which, in collaboration with the Cardinal Prefect, Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, and the Pro-Rector of the Pontifical Urban College De Propaganda Fide, Saverio Maria Paventi di San Bonaventura, he began to establish a network of assistants with whom he managed to save approximately 6,500 people such as civilians, military personnel and Jews, whom he lodged in Vatican extraterritorial residences and religious institutes during the German occupation of Rome in the Second World War. That activity, which was carried out while he evaded repeated traps by Herbert Kappler and Pietro Koch, resulted in O&#x27;Flaherty being nicknamed &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican&quot;.

==World War II==
In the early years of World War II, O&#x27;Flaherty toured prisoner-of-war (POW) camps in Italy and tried to find out about prisoners who had been reported missing in action. If he found them alive, he tried to reassure their families through Radio Vatican.

When Mussolini was removed from power by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943, thousands of Allied prisoners-of-war were either released or escaped after being deliberately left unguarded by their Italian Royal Army guards, but when Germany imposed an occupation over Italy, they were in danger of recapture. Some of them, remembering visits by O&#x27;Flaherty, reached Rome and asked him for help. Others went to the Irish embassy to the Holy See, the only English-speaking embassy to remain open in Rome during the war. Delia Murphy, who was the wife of Thomas J. Kiernan, the Irish ambassador (and in her day, she was a well-known traditional singer of Irish ballads), was one of those who helped O&#x27;Flaherty.

O&#x27;Flaherty did not wait for permission from his superiors. He recruited the help of other priests (including two young New Zealanders, Fathers Owen Snedden and John Flanagan), two agents working for the Free French, François de Vial and Yves Debroise, communists and a Swiss count. One of his aides was British Major Sam Derry, an escapee. Derry along with the British officers and escaped POWs Lieutenants Furman and Simpson, and Captain Byrnes, a Canadian, were responsible for the security and operational organisation. O&#x27;Flaherty also kept contact with Sir D&#x27;Arcy Osborne, British Ambassador to the Holy See, and his butler, John May, whom O&#x27;Flaherty described as &quot;a genius... the most magnificent scrounger&quot;. O&#x27;Flaherty and his allies concealed 4,000 escapees, mainly Allied soldiers and Jews, in flats, farms and convents. Among those sheltered was one Ines Gistron and a Jewish friend whom O&#x27;Flaherty placed in a &quot;pensione&quot; run by Canadian nuns at Monteverde (Rome), where they were given false identification.

One of the first hideouts was beside the local SS headquarters. O&#x27;Flaherty and Derry co-ordinated all of that from his room at the Collegio Teutonico. When outside the Vatican, O&#x27;Flaherty wore various disguises. The Gestapo eventually found out first that the leader of the network was a priest and then learned his identity; but could not arrest him inside the Vatican. When the secretly anti-Nazi German ambassador to the Holy See, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, violated German Foreign Office orders and revealed that to O&#x27;Flaherty, he began to meet his contacts on the stairs of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Multiple SS conspiracies to kidnap or assassinate O&#x27;Flaherty, even on Vatican soil, failed.

&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Kappler, the head of the &quot;SS Sicherheitsdienst&quot; and &quot;Gestapo&quot; in Rome, learned of O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s actions and ordered a white line painted on the pavement at the opening of St. Peter&#x27;s Square, which signified the border between Vatican City and Occupied Italy, and vowed that the priest would be killed if he crossed it. Italian Fascist Pietro Koch, the head of the Banda Koch, a special task force charged with hunting down partisans and rounding up deportees for the Gestapo, often boasted of his plans to personally torture and execute O&#x27;Flaherty if he were ever captured by Koch&#x27;s unit.

Adding to the dangers O&#x27;Flaherty faced was a mole inside the Curia: former Russicum seminarian Alexander Kurtna, a convert to the Russian Greek Catholic Church from Estonian Orthodoxy. Following his expulsion by the Russicum&#x27;s rector in 1940, Kurtna served, with only one interruption between 1940 and 1944, as a translator for the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Eastern Churches. At the same time, he spied for the Soviet NKVD, with devastating results for many underground priests and faithful on Soviet soil. Kurtna, who was always loyal to the USSR, only started also spying for Nazi Germany in 1943 because his handler, Herbert Kappler, threatened to send Kurtna and his wife to a concentration camp otherwise. Kurtna, however, betrayed Kappler by recruiting the latter&#x27;s female secretary into stealing the codebooks from Kappler&#x27;s office shortly before the liberation of Rome and passing them to the Soviets. Following the liberation of the city, Kurtna found the NKVD to be ungrateful masters and ended up as a political prisoner in the Norillag region of the Soviet Gulag.

Several others, including priests, nuns and laypeople, worked in secret with O&#x27;Flaherty and even hid refugees in their own homes around Rome. Among them were the Augustinian Maltese Fathers Egidio Galea, Aurelio Borg and Ugolino Gatt, the Dutch Augustinian Father Anselmus Musters and Brother Robert Pace of the Brothers of Christian Schools. Another person who contributed significantly to the operation was Maltese national Chetta Chevalier, who hid refugees in her house with her children and escaped detection. Jewish religious services were conducted on the Jewish Sabbath and the High Holy Days in the Basilica di San Clemente, which was under the diplomatic protection of the Irish Foreign Office, beneath a painting of Tobias.

When the Allies arrived in Rome in June 1944, 6,425 of the escapees were still alive. O&#x27;Flaherty demanded that German POWs be treated properly as well. He took a plane to South Africa to inspect the conditions for Italian POWs and to Jerusalem to visit Jewish refugees. Of the 9,700 Jews in Rome, only 1,007 had been captured and shipped to Auschwitz. The rest were hidden, over 5,000 of them by the Church, 300 in Castel Gandolfo, 200 or 400 (estimates vary) as &quot;members&quot; of the Palatine Guard and some 1,500 in monasteries, convents and colleges. The remaining 3,700 were hidden in private homes.

During the liberation of Rome, O&#x27;Flaherty and Derry&#x27;s organisation was caring for 3,925 escapees and men who had evaded arrest. Of them, 1,695 were British, 896 South African, 429 Soviet, 425 Greek and 185 American. The remainder were from a further 20 nations. That does not include Jews and sundry other men and women who were in O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s personal care.

O´Flaherty later flew to Palestine and aided in the resettlement of Jewish Holocaust survivors.
==Postwar==
After the war, O&#x27;Flaherty received a number of awards, including appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) &quot;for services to the Forces in Italy&quot; and the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He was also honoured by Canada and Australia. He refused to use the lifetime pension that Italy had given to him. In 1954, he was promoted to domestic prelate. In the 1950s, the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, in the form proposed by Mary Faustina Kowalska, who was later canonised by John Paul II, was under a ban from the Vatican. It was O&#x27;Flaherty who, as notary, signed the document that notified Catholics of the ban. He was the first Irishman named Notary of the Holy Office.

O&#x27;Flaherty regularly visited his old nemesis, Herbert Kappler (the former &quot;SS&quot; chief in Rome), in prison month after month and was Kappler&#x27;s only visitor. In 1959, Kappler converted to Catholicism and was baptised by O&#x27;Flaherty.

In 1960, O&#x27;Flaherty suffered a serious stroke during Mass and was forced to return to Ireland. Shortly before his first stroke in 1960, he was about to be confirmed as the papal nuncio to Tanzania. He moved to Cahersiveen to live with his sister, at whose home he died on 30 October 1963, aged 65.

He was buried in the cemetery of the Daniel O&#x27;Connell Memorial Church in Cahersiveen. There is a monument in Killarney Town and a grove of trees dedicated to his memory in the Killarney National Park.
Some sources incorrectly state that in 2003, he became the first Irish person honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel. However, according to the official list, this is not the case and Mary Elmes remains the only Irish person so honoured. An application to have him added to the rolls was being prepared in 2017.

==Dramatization==
O&#x27;Flaherty was portrayed by Gregory Peck in the 1983 television film &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot;, which follows the exploits of O&#x27;Flaherty from the German occupation of Rome to its liberation by the Allies.

He was also the second principal character in a radio play by Robin Glendinning on Kappler&#x27;s time seeking asylum in the Vatican, titled &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican&quot;, which was first broadcast on 30 November 2006 on Radio 4, with Wolf Kahler as Kappler.

Killarney-born actor and playwright Donal Courtney penned a new one-man play entitled &quot;God Has No Country&quot;, which he premièred in Killarney as part of the Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty memorial celebrations for three nights in October 2013. Courtney portrays the O&#x27;Flaherty during the wartime years in German-occupied Rome; the story is told from the O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s point of view and is a study of the torment and difficulty in the decisions he undertook in his fight for justice.

In 2023, Joseph O&#x27;Connor published &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot;, a novel based on the exploits of O&#x27;Flaherty and his resistance group.

=== Television ===
The Irish-language television station TG4 broadcast a 51-minute documentary on O&#x27;Flaherty in 2008. It is available (in mixed Irish/English with English subtitles) on a region-free DVD entitled &quot;The Pimpernel of the Vatican – The Amazing Story of Monsignor Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty&quot;.

<text>Sławomir Rawicz (; 1 September 1915 – 5 April 2004) was a Polish Army lieutenant who was imprisoned by the NKVD after the German-Soviet invasion of Poland. In a ghost-written book called &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, he claimed that in 1941 he and six others had escaped from a Siberian Gulag camp and begun a long journey south on foot (about ), supposedly travelling through the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and the Himalayas before finally reaching British India in the winter of 1942.

In 2006, the BBC released a report based on former Soviet records, including statements written by Rawicz himself, showing that Rawicz had been released as part of the 1942 general amnesty of Poles in the USSR and subsequently transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran, leading the report to conclude that his supposed escape to India never occurred.

In May 2009, Witold Gliński, a Polish World War II veteran living in the UK, came forward to claim that the story of Rawicz was true, but was actually an account of what happened to him, not Rawicz. Gliński&#x27;s claims have been severely questioned by various sources. The son of Rupert Mayne, a British intelligence officer in wartime India, stated that in 1942, in Calcutta, his father had interviewed three emaciated men who claimed to have escaped from Siberia. According to his son, Mayne always believed that their story was the same as that of &quot;The Long Walk&quot;—but telling the story decades later, his son could not remember their names or any details. Subsequent research failed to unearth confirmatory evidence for the story.

==Early life and army career==
Sławomir Rawicz was born on 1 September 1915 in Pinsk, the son of a landowner. He received private primary education and went on to study architecture in 1932. In 1937 he joined the Polish Army Reserve and underwent the cadet officer school. In July 1939 he married Vera, his first wife. She went missing during World War II.

According to his account, when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union defeated Poland, Rawicz returned home, where the NKVD arrested him on 19 November 1939. He was taken to Minsk, then sent to Kharkiv for interrogation, then to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, where he was put on rigged trial. He was tortured to make him confess to being a spy which initially was unsuccessful. He was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour in a Siberian prison camp, ostensibly for espionage as were thousands of others. Researchers for the BBC Radio program &quot;The Long Walk&quot; in 2006 unearthed documents indicating that the charge against Rawicz might have been for killing a Soviet NKVD officer.

== &quot;The Long Walk&quot; – Escape from the Gulag camp and walk to India ==

According to the account in the book, Rawicz was transported, alongside thousands of others, to Irkutsk and made to walk to the Gulag Camp 303, which was south of the Arctic Circle. His labour duties in the camp included the construction of the prisoners&#x27; barracks, the manufacture of skis for the Soviet army, and the repair and operation of the camp commandant&#x27;s radio.

In &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, Rawicz describes how he and six companions escaped from the camp in the middle of a blizzard in 1941 and headed south, avoiding towns. The fugitive party included three Polish soldiers, a Latvian landowner, a Lithuanian architect, and an enigmatic US metro engineer called &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;; they were later joined by a 17-year-old Polish girl, Kristina. They journeyed from Siberia to India crossing the Gobi Desert and Himalayas. Four of the group died, two in the Gobi, two in the Himalayas. The book also mentions the spotting of a pair of yeti-like creatures in the Himalayas.

According to the book, four survivors of the 11-month trek reached British India around March 1942 and stumbled upon a Gurkha patrol. They were taken to a hospital in Calcutta. Towards the end of the book, Mr. Smith asked Rawicz about his future. Rawicz told Smith he would rejoin the Polish army. Once released from the hospital, the survivors went their own ways. Some were still permanently sick from the hardships of the Long Walk.

== WWII activities after imprisonment ==

According to Rawicz, he moved from India to Iraq, then re-entered the Soviet Union in June 1942 and rejoined the Polish Army on 24 July 1942 at Kermini. He then returned to Iraq with Polish troops and moved on to Palestine, where he spent time recovering in a hospital and teaching in a military school. He claimed that General Władysław Anders had recommended his transfer to Britain for training as a pilot of the Polish Air Forces in Great Britain.

== Historical records ==

Soviet records confirm that Rawicz was a Polish soldier imprisoned in the USSR, but differ from &quot;The Long Walk&quot; in detail on the reasons for his arrest and the exact places of imprisonment. Polish Army records show that Rawicz left the USSR directly for Iran in 1942, which contradicts the book&#x27;s storyline. Aside from matters concerning his health, his arrival in Palestine is verified by the records. The story of the escape to India comes from Rawicz himself.

According to the Captain&#x27;s son and long after the supposed event, Captain Rupert Mayne, an intelligence officer in Calcutta, said that in 1942 he had debriefed three emaciated men claiming to have escaped from a Siberian Gulag camp. Mayne did not provide any further details, did not identify Rawicz as one of the men, and despite extensive subsequent research no hard confirmatory evidence has been found.

== Postwar life ==

After the war he settled in Sandiacre, Derbyshire, England, and worked at the Nottingham Design Centre. He married Marjorie Gregory née Needham in 1947; they had five children. In the early 1970s he became a technician at the Architectural Ceramics course at Nottingham Trent University School of Art and Design. A heart attack forced him into early retirement in 1975. He lived a quiet life with his family, giving public talks and answering fan mail, until his death, aged 88, on 5 April 2004.

Three weeks after Harold Nicolson reviewed &quot;The Long Walk&quot; for &quot;The Observer,&quot; the newspaper published a short article entitled &quot;Long Walker&quot;, in response to readers&#x27; questions about Rawicz&#x27;s postwar life. In addition to the familiar biographical details to 1956, presumably supplied by author or publisher, the article added: &quot;About his real name he preserves secrecy&quot;.

==&quot;The Long Walk&quot;==

&quot;The Long Walk&quot; was ghost-written by Ronald Downing based on conversations with Rawicz. It was released in the UK in 1956 and has sold over half a million copies worldwide and has been translated into 25 languages. The Readers Book Club edition (1958), and the &quot;concise&quot; version (edited by S. H. Burton) brought out by Longmans and Green in their Heritage of Literature Series for schools (1960), helped popularise the book. The &quot;concise&quot; edition went out of print in the late 1980s.

The film &quot;The Way Back&quot; (released in late 2010), directed by Peter Weir, was inspired by the story.

Over the years, numerous critics of the book have challenged its authenticity and accuracy, including Peter Fleming (Ian Fleming&#x27;s brother), Eric Shipton, and Hugh E. Richardson, a British diplomat stationed in Lhasa.

==Other versions and historical research==

Various people have researched the veracity of the story. Examples include:

*Witold Gliński, a Polish survivor of the war, claimed that he was the person who did &quot;the long walk&quot;. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published his story in 2009.
*Leszek Gliniecki, another Polish war survivor, claims to have multiple documents showing that Gliński could not have been there.
*Linda Willis did a decade of research on most parts of the story, without reaching a definite conclusion, but cleared up some details.

Leszek Gliniecki has copies of official documents which state that Witold Gliński was born in 1926 (22 November), was sent into forced exile to a special settlement Kriesty in Arkhangelsk Oblast (Province), Russia, and stayed there from 24 February 1940 to 2 September 1941. 
This is confirmed by the international organisation &quot;Memorial&quot;, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance and the Arkhangelsk Province archives. The above information would not allow Witold Gliński to have taken part in the Long Walk.
Archives of the Polish Army in the West, and his death certificate confirm that Witold Gliński was born in 1926.

<text>Jip and Janneke (Dutch: &quot;Jip en Janneke&quot;) is a series of children&#x27;s books in the Netherlands, written by Annie M. G. Schmidt and illustrated by Fiep Westendorp. The series is known for its simplicity and wit.

The series was originally written for Het Parool. Between 13 September 1952 and 7 September 1957 a weekly episode of no more than 250 words was published. Each episode is an independent story in itself. The stories were later collected and published as books.

The series has been translated into a number of languages, including Chinese (called Yǐyǐ hé Yāyā, simplified Chinese: 乙乙和丫丫), Hebrew, and Latin (called &quot;Jippus et Jannica&quot;). Three English versions have been published. &quot;Mick and Mandy&quot;, an adaptation with the original illustrations, and &quot;Bob and Jilly&quot;, translations with new illustrations, are no longer in print. In 2008 the Dutch publisher, Querido, published a new translation by David Colmer of the first book of the series, with the original illustrations, entitled &quot;Jip and Janneke&quot;.

The series has become something of a popular icon of childhood and has inspired a large amount of merchandise. One of the best known of these is Jip and Janneke Bubbelsap (&quot;Bubble Juice&quot;), which is a non-alcoholic carbonated lemonade sold in Champagne-style plastic bottles, popular at children&#x27;s parties and for new year celebrations.

In recent years, Jip and Janneke has become part of an expression. &quot;Jip and Janneke language&quot; (Dutch: &quot;jip-en-janneketaal&quot;) has come to mean &quot;simple language&quot;, layman&#x27;s terms or plain language. It is most often used in the context of politics, when politicians think they need to express their ideas in Jip and Janneke language in order to make the people understand what they are talking about.

<text>Dikkie Dik is a Dutch series of children&#x27;s picture books, starring the eponymous orange tomcat Dikkie Dik. The books are drawn by author Jet Boeke, and feature short, concise texts by Arthur van Norden. The series started in 1978 as part of the Dutch version of the children&#x27;s TV show Sesame Street, but soon the stories appeared in bookstores. 

On Sesame Street the stories were read aloud by Piet Hendriks, with recurring characters like Tommie, Pino or Troel listening. In the early 1980s the stories in Sesame Street were told by Rudy Kuhn, with some children as an audience, and in 1985 Frank Groothof took over.

In 2000 Boeke received the &quot;Kiekeboekprijs&quot; for her book &quot;Waar is Dikkie Dik?&quot;, as the best book for toddlers of the year.

In 2024 Joost Van Den Bosch directed a movie called Dikkie Dik en de Verdwenen Knuffel: (Tummy Tom and the Lost Teddy Bear) 

In the movie Tummy Tom and the Lost Teddy Bear: Tummy Tom discovers something shocking: Bear, his favorite cuddle toy, is missing and nowhere to be found. Luckily, his friend Cat Mouse is there to help, because Tummy Tom can&#x27;t sleep without Bear.

== Satire ==
The theatershow &quot;Sex&quot; of the Dutch theater group De Vliegende Panters contains a persiflage on Dikkie Dik (in fact it&#x27;s a parody of the narrator of Surinamese origin Rudy Kuhn, who read in the program Sesame Street from Dikkie Dik in the eighties), in which he stole a car radio and put a shot. The theatershow &quot;Sex&quot; was performed in 1996. At that time Rudy Kuhn hadn&#x27;t been on Sesame Street for 10 years.

<text>Robert Lee Vesco (December 4, 1935 – November 23, 2007) was an American criminal financier. After several years of risky investments and dubious credit dealings, Vesco was alleged to have committed securities fraud. He immediately fled the ensuing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation by living in a number of Central American and Caribbean countries.

Vesco was notorious throughout his life, attempting to buy a Caribbean island from Antigua to create an autonomous country and having a national law in Costa Rica made to protect him from extradition. A 2001 Slate.com article termed Vesco &quot;the undisputed king of the fugitive financiers.&quot; After settling in Cuba during 1982, Vesco was charged with drug smuggling in 1989. During the 1990s he was indicted by the Cuban government for &quot;fraud and illicit economic activity&quot; and &quot;acts prejudicial to the economic plans and contracts of the state&quot; in 1996.

Vesco was sentenced to 13 years in jail by Cuba. In November 2007 the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that he had died of lung cancer at a hospital in Havana, Cuba, five months before, although it has been suggested that he faked his death.

==Biography==
Vesco was the son of a Detroit autoworker. He was born in Detroit, Michigan, where he grew up and attended, and then quit, Cass Technical High School. He quit engineering school during his early twenties to work for an investment company. With an $800 stake, Vesco began matching buyers and sellers in the aluminum market until he eventually acquired a portion of the profits of a floundering aluminum plant. By 1965, he could borrow enough money to acquire International Controls Corporation (ICC). Through aggressively hostile expansions and debt-financed takeovers of other businesses he increased ICC quickly. By 1968 the company owned an airline and several manufacturing plants, and Vesco had shares totaling US$50 million.

===IOS scandal===
In 1970, Vesco began a successful takeover bid for Investors Overseas Service, Ltd., a mutual fund investment company with holdings of $1.5 billion managed by financier Bernard Cornfeld, who were in trouble with the SEC. When his company began to experience financial difficulty, no &quot;white knight&quot; was willing to get involved. Vesco saw his chance and began a protracted battle to assume control of the company, opposed by Cornfeld and others. Cornfeld was jailed in Switzerland and Vesco was accused of looting the company of hundreds of millions of dollars. Many prominent figures in global business, finance, and royalty were associated with the mess, receiving money from one party or the other for their endorsement. Among the accusations against Vesco were that he parked funds belonging to IOS investors in a series of dummy corporations, one of which had an Amsterdam address that was later associated with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, and that he broke into a Swiss bank vault to obtain shares. These allegations are unproven, as Vesco fled the country and spent the next fifteen years relocating between countries that lacked extradition treaties with the United States.

During February 1973, with criminal charges against him imminent, Vesco used the corporate jet to flee to Costa Rica along with about $200 million worth of IOS&#x27;s investments, according to SEC allegations. Vesco would continue to wage a legal battle from Costa Rica and the Bahamas to try to maintain control of his 26 percent of ICC stock, but, with five outstanding indictments for securities fraud against him, he could not return to the United States. It was not until 1981 that ICC had become completely free of Vesco&#x27;s control, after paying almost $12 million to him and his family.

===Nixon scandal===
Among the charges that emerged during the 1970s, the SEC accused Vesco of embezzling $220 million from four different IOS funds. During 1973, Vesco fled to Costa Rica. Shortly before his departure, hoping to end the SEC investigation into his activities, Vesco routed substantial contributions to Richard Nixon through Nixon&#x27;s nephew Donald A. Nixon.

Vesco was also investigated for a secret $200,000 contribution made to the 1972 campaign to re-elect Nixon. As counsel to International Controls Corporation, New Jersey lawyer Harry L. Sears delivered the contribution to Maurice Stans, finance chairman for the Committee to Re-elect the President. Vesco had wanted Attorney General John N. Mitchell to intercede on his behalf with SEC chairman William J. Casey. While Vesco fled the country, Stans, Mitchell, and Sears were indicted for obstruction of justice, though charges against all three were dismissed.

===&quot;Vesco law&quot;===
In Costa Rica, Vesco donated $2.1 million to Sociedad Agricola Industrial San Cristobal, S.A., a company initiated by President José Figueres. Figueres passed a law to guarantee that Vesco would not be extradited. Figueres&#x27; constitutional term ended during 1974. Vesco remained in Costa Rica until 1978, when President Rodrigo Carazo (1978–1982) repealed what was popularly referred to as the &quot;Vesco Law.&quot;

During 1978 Vesco relocated first to Nassau and then to Antigua. 
* While in Nassau in the seventies, Vesco&#x27;s business ties with Lynden Pindling and Carlos Lehder were the subject of CIA investigations. It is believed that Bill Fairclough (ostensibly working for Coopers &amp; Lybrand) investigated these ties. Despite Vesco&#x27;s fall-out with Pindling, he still maintained a golden gated mansion staffed by armed guards situated North East of Nassau close to Paradise Island where one of his yachts was moored as noted in the autobiographical journal &quot;Beyond Enkription&quot; by Fairclough (a.k.a. Edward Burlington). On Vesco&#x27;s orders, Fairclough was drugged and kidnapped whilst at The Pink Pussycat Club on Delancy Street in Nassau. He awoke on Vesco&#x27;s yacht but managed to force the yacht back to shore and escaped after having stolen a revolver from one of Vesco&#x27;s guards.
* While in Antigua Vesco tried unsuccessfully to buy the sister island Barbuda and establish it as a sovereign state. The Costa Rican government refused his attempt to return during 1978, while Rodrigo Carazo was President. During 1982 Vesco tried again to return to Costa Rica, but President Luis A. Monge denied his entry.

He lived in Nicaragua for a while, while the Sandinista government was in power. Each of these countries accepted him, hoping that his great wealth would finance local development projects. However, this worked badly for everybody involved, although Vesco was reputed to have stolen more than $200 million, and appeared several times on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the wealthiest people in the world.

===Nixon scandal, Pt. II===
During 1982 he relocated to Cuba, a country that could provide him with treatment for his painful urinary tract infections and would not extradite him to the U.S. Cuban authorities accepted him on the condition that he not become involved in any financial deals. He married Lidia Alfonso Llauger.

Vesco was indicted during 1989 on drug smuggling charges.

During the 1990s, Vesco became involved once again with Donald Nixon after Nixon went to Cuba seeking to partner with the government in conducting clinical trials on a substance called trixolan or TX, which he claimed boosted the immune system. Vesco introduced Nixon to Fidel Castro and his brother, Raúl Castro, and the Cuban government agreed to provide laboratory facilities and doctors to conduct the trials. Results from the studies were claimed to be positive. In Cuba, Vesco joined forces with rogue former CIA operative Frank Terpil, and they offered their network of contacts to the Cuban government.

On or about May 31, 1995, Vesco attempted to defraud Nixon and Raúl Castro, and Cuban authorities seized control of the project and arrested Vesco, his wife, and Terpil.

At the time of Vesco&#x27;s arrest the Cuban Foreign Ministry said he had been taken into custody &quot;under suspicion of being a provocateur and an agent of foreign special services,&quot; or intelligence agencies. However, he was formally charged with &quot;fraud and illicit economic activity&quot; and &quot;acts prejudicial to the economic plans and contracts of the state.&quot; During 1996 the Cuban government sentenced Vesco to 13 years in prison on charges resulting from the scandal. He was scheduled for release during 2009, when he would have been 74 years old. Vesco&#x27;s wife Lidia was convicted on lesser charges and was released during 2005.

==Reported death==
Vesco reportedly died of lung cancer in November 2007 and was buried at Colon Cemetery in Havana. However, reports of his death have been disputed as his associate Frank Terpil said that he had fled to Sierra Leone.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized version of Vesco is featured prominently in a sixth season episode of &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, titled &quot;Robert Vesco (No. 9)&quot;, in which he is portrayed by actor Stacy Keach. The fictionalized Vesco is shown to have faked his own death in Cuba in 2007 and to be in pursuit of a legendary shipwreck from the Spanish treasure fleet.

Another fictionalized version of Vesco was featured in the 1980 movie, &quot;The Return of Frank Cannon.&quot; Intended as a possible reboot pilot for the canceled detective series &quot;Cannon&quot;, the TV film featured the even more portly ex private eye enjoying sedate retirement as a gourmet restaurateur and fishing charter boat captain until he is lured by a still fetching old flame (from his presumably less obese post World War II army days) back into hefty gumshoe action to solve the murder of her husband, a retired CIA agent turned country horse breeder. Cannon winds up chasing down an expat financier similar to Vesco (played by Arthur Hill) along a still warm trail from Costa Rica back to the US after he finds out the murder victim had stumbled on a plot among other retired CIA agents to smuggle the fugitive back into the US following plastic surgery, where he had assumed a new identity as the dead man&#x27;s inconspicuous neighborly horse vet.

<text>Ot en Sien is a Dutch children&#x27;s book series, written by Hindericus Scheepstra, a teacher in Drenthe, the Netherlands. It centers around two little children, a boy named Ot and a girl named Sien.

It was the start of a new method of writing children&#x27;s books and had profound influence on Dutch elementary education in the first half of the twentieth century

==The authors==
&quot;Ot&quot; and &quot;Sien&quot; are the main characters in a series of Dutch children&#x27;s tales that were very popular in the first half of the twentieth century. The first series titled (&#x27;Close to home&#x27;), appeared in 1902. The second series (&#x27;Still with mother&#x27;), followed in 1904. The author of the stories was Hindericus Scheepstra. However, he acted on the inspiration of Jan Ligthart, who had the intention to expose young people to what he considered a healthy daily family life. The illustrations were made by .

After WWII the stories of Ot and Sien gradually went out of fashion and they were often ridiculed for the unrealistic picture they gave of life in the province. A century after their appearance there is a revival in the interest for the publications and in 2004 an exposition was held, focusing mostly on the artwork by Jetses.

==The characters==
Ot (short for Otto) and Sien (short for e.g. Francine) are two next door neighbors, a boy and a girl. Their illustrations were based on two children that actually lived in Jetses&#x27; neighborhood. The stories are situated in Drenthe that was at the time the most impoverished province of the Netherlands where quite a few people were still living in dwellings constructed of peat and sods. The surrounding poverty is nowhere to be seen in the stories that depict a very idealized version of reality.

==Ligthart&#x27;s philosophy==
What Ligthart intended was to give a description of the daily family interactions of the main characters as a means to set an idealized example &quot;where from an early age Father and Mother relate to each other and to the children, where a civilized and wellwilling tone is dominant, where the parents give a living example of friendliness, adaptability and sacrifice on a daily basis, not only towards each other and the children, but also towards the servants and the guests&quot;

==Influence on education==

Ligthart&#x27;s philosophy was followed by many teachers in elementary schools in the Netherlands and the &quot;Ot en Sien&quot; books became a ubiquitous teaching tool for reading in elementary schools. This phenomenon lasted until late in the 1950s and is one of the most remarkable developments in education in the country. Generations of children in the ever more urbanizing and suburbanizing society grew up with an idyllic and rather unrealistic view of what family life should be like and apparently &quot;was&quot; like in the country side of Drenthe. Few city kids ever experienced that and their parents certainly did not have a servant in the house.
Knowing this, one is also aware that small-town life is usually less expensive. Still in the 1980s, Ot en Sien were very present in the lives of the children that grew up in Drenthe; their stories are a classic and loved both by young and old. They have left a strong impression on those who had the luck of having a simple and perhaps a somewhat naíve childhood, growing up in this province.

==Monuments==

In the Hague a statue of Ot and Sien was erected in 1930. The text was to read &quot;In memory of Jan Ligthart&quot; but his widow Marie Lion Cachet objected to this because she knew that her husband had not actually written the stories, although he had given his friend Scheepstra continuous advice. Scheepstra had the advantage that he was a Drenthe native and so could add a measure of local color to the stories. The inscription therefore was amended to &quot;In memory of Jan Ligthart and H. Scheepstra&quot;. Later the town of Roden in Drenthe also dedicated a monument to Ot and Sien and their creators.
==Dutch expressions==

* , (&#x27;like Ot and Sien&#x27;): childishly simple.
* , (&#x27;From the time of Ot and Sien&#x27;): from the good old days, from olden days.

==Literature==
*Jan A. Niemeijer (1997) &quot;Kijk, Ot en Sien, een klassieker in de Nederlandse jeugdliteratuur&quot;. 2e druk Baarn, Uitgeverij Callenbach. (in Dutch)

<text>William Ellsworth Robinson (April 2, 1861 – March 24, 1918) was an American magician who went by the stage name Chung Ling Soo (). He is mostly remembered today for his extensive use of yellowface in his act to falsely represent himself to be a Chinese man who spoke little English, as well as for his accidental death due to a failed bullet catch trick.

==Early years==
Robinson was born in Westchester County, New York, the first of three children born to James Campbell Robinson and his wife Sarah Robinson (&quot;née&quot; Titus). Both of his parents were of Scottish descent. The family settled in Manhattan while James Robinson toured in Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; White&#x27;s minstrel shows. James Robinson variously performed under the names &quot;James Campbell&quot;, &quot;H. J. Campbell&quot; and &quot;Professor Campbell&quot;, and his specialties included impersonations, &quot;dialect singing&quot;, hypnotism, ventriloquism and magic tricks. He later taught his son how to perform magic tricks.

==Career==
Robinson performed his first magic show at the age of 14 and began performing professionally on the vaudeville circuit shortly thereafter. He initially performed under the name &quot;Robinson, the Man of Mystery&quot;. Robinson earned a decent living performing his act but was eager to become a headliner on vaudeville. In 1887, he began performing &quot;black art illusions&quot; under the name &quot;Achmed Ben Ali&quot;. The act and Robinson&#x27;s new stage name closely resembled that of German magician Max Auzinger, who performed under the name &quot;Ben Ali Bey&quot;. (As Auzinger never toured the United States, the resemblance went largely unnoticed at the time.)

By 1896, Robinson had performed his acts in shows for Harry Kellar and Alexander Herrmann. After Herrmann&#x27;s death in 1896, Robinson decided to strike out on his own. Around this time, Robinson learned of a challenge issued by Chinese stage magician Ching Ling Foo. In a gimmick that was standard for magicians of that era, Foo offered a prize of $1,000 to any person who could successfully duplicate his illusions. Robinson, who had watched Foo&#x27;s act when he toured the United States and figured out how his illusions worked, accepted the challenge. However, Foo refused to meet with him as Robinson had accepted another previous challenge issued by Foo and lost. The snub left Robinson upset. In 1898, he authored the book &quot;Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena&quot;. The book exposed the tricks of slate writing and a number of devices that fraudulent mediums would use to pretend to contact the dead.

In 1900, Robinson learned that an agent was looking for a Chinese magician to perform at the Folies Bergère in Paris. He accepted the job and quickly created a new act based on Ching Ling Foo&#x27;s act. Robinson then began dressing in traditional Chinese attire, shaved his facial hair and began wearing his hair in a queue. To darken his complexion, he painted his face with greasepaint. To complete his new act, Robinson chose the stage name &quot;Hop Sing Soo&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s new act was a hit, and by the time he began performing in London, he had perfected his act and changed his name to &quot;Chung Ling Soo&quot; (a variation of Ching Ling Foo&#x27;s name). Robinson then set about creating a fanciful back story for himself. As &quot;Chung Ling Soo&quot;, Robinson claimed he was the American-born son of a Scottish missionary who married a Cantonese woman. He claimed his father was a descendant of the Campbell and Robinson clans and both his parents died before he was 13 years old. As an orphan, Soo said he was taken in by a Chinese magician named &quot;Arr Hee&quot;, who trained him to perform ancient Chinese magic tricks mixed with more modern European magic. When Hee died, Soo began performing the magic his mentor had taught him.

As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson maintained his role as a Chinese man scrupulously. He never spoke onstage, claiming that he spoke no English (though he did occasionally say phrases in broken English) and always used an interpreter when he spoke to journalists. Soo&#x27;s Chinese wife, &quot;Suee Seen&quot;, acted as his assistant. &quot;Suee Seen&quot; was also Robinson&#x27;s invention; in reality, she was Olive &quot;Dot&quot; Path, an American woman whom Robinson claimed was his wife. In fact, the two never married, as Robinson had never divorced his first wife, Bessie Smith.

As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson quickly became a popular stage magician in Europe and eventually became one of the highest-paid performers on the vaudeville circuit.

===Feud with Ching Ling Foo===
In January 1905, Soo was in London for an engagement at the Hippodrome. His rival, magician Ching Ling Foo, was performing at the nearby Empire Theatre. By this time, Foo was aware that Chung Ling Soo was actually William Robinson and that he had copied virtually Foo&#x27;s entire act. He publicly called Chung Ling Soo an imposter and became intent on publicly exposing him as such. In order to garner publicity, Foo&#x27;s promoter publicly announced that he would duplicate at least half of Chung Ling Soo&#x27;s illusions to prove that he was the real &quot;Original Chinese Conjurer&quot;. Soo accepted the challenge and agreed to meet Foo at the offices of &quot;The Weekly Dispatch&quot; for a press conference. When Ching Ling Foo realized that the press was not interested in Chung Ling Soo&#x27;s real identity, he backed out of the press conference and the challenge. The episode was a public embarrassment for Ching Ling Foo, who remained at the Empire Theatre for only four weeks (Chung Ling Soo&#x27;s engagement at the Hippodrome lasted three months).

Soo&#x27;s most famous illusion, partly because of his death while performing it, was called &quot;Condemned to Death by the Boxers&quot;. In this trick, Soo&#x27;s assistants, sometimes dressed as Boxers, took two guns on to the stage. Several members of the audience were called up to the stage to mark a bullet that appeared to be loaded into one of the guns. Attendants fired the gun at Soo, and he appeared to catch the bullets from the air and drop them on a plate he held up in front of him. Actually, Soo palmed the bullets, hiding them in his hand during their examination and marking. The muzzle-loaded guns were rigged so that the gunpowder charge fired in a chamber below the barrel so that the bullet never left the gun.

The only known film record of &quot;Chung Ling Soo&quot; that exists today shows him greeting World War I veterans at a 1915 benefit performance.

==Personal life==
Robinson married his assistant Bessie Smith on February 23, 1883. Shortly after the couple married, in December 1883, a woman with whom Robinson had been having an affair (possibly a young servant girl who worked for Robinson&#x27;s parents) gave birth to his child, a girl named Annie. Robinson&#x27;s parents took the child in and raised her. Robinson and Smith would later have a son, Elmore (born February 1885). After the birth of their son, Smith could no longer rehearse long hours and travel with Robinson as his assistant. He soon lost interest in his wife after meeting Olive &quot;Dot&quot; Path (born Augusta Pfaff), who would also become his assistant. As divorce was considered socially unacceptable at the time and Robinson was a Roman Catholic, he and Smith never formally divorced and simply decided to &quot;cancel&quot; their marriage.

Robinson and Path presented themselves as husband and wife for the next twenty years. They eventually married in a civil ceremony in March 1906. The marriage was not legally recognized as Robinson was still married to Bessie Smith. Shortly after Robinson married Path, he met Janet Louise Mary &quot;Lou&quot; Blatchford, an English woman from Plymouth. They began a sexual relationship and Blatchford became pregnant in May 1907. Path was angry to learn that Robinson had been unfaithful but the two decided to continue to present themselves as husband and wife for the sake of the act. While &quot;Chung Ling Soo&quot; and &quot;Suee Seen&quot; continued to tour Europe, Blatchford lived in Barnes, London. In between engagements, Robinson would visit the home and the couple&#x27;s children, of which there were eventually three: Ellsworth James (born February 1908), Hector (born December 1909) and Mary (born March 1911).

==Death==
On March 23, 1918, Chung Ling Soo was performing at the Wood Green Empire in London. He performed his act without incident until he got to the famous &quot;Condemned to Death by the Boxers&quot; illusion, his version of the bullet catch. That night, as one of his assistants fired the modified gun at him, some of the gunpowder exploded in the gun&#x27;s chamber, accidentally firing the bullet (loaded only for show by the assistant) into Soo&#x27;s lung. He fell to the ground and said, &quot;Oh my God. Something&#x27;s happened. Lower the curtain.&quot; This was the only time since adopting his persona that &quot;Chung Ling Soo&quot; had spoken English in public. Soo was taken to Passmore Edwards Cottage Hospital, but died the following morning. He is buried in East Sheen Cemetery in East Sheen, a suburb of London. The assistant who fired the gun, Jack Grossman, appeared on the UK TV show &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;, broadcast on November 6, 1982, where he assisted magician Paul Daniels to successfully recreate the trick.

During the inquest, Olive &quot;Dot&quot; Path explained the nature of Chung Ling Soo&#x27;s trick. The muskets Soo used in his act were brazed with extra steel barrels. After each performance, to avoid expending powder and bullets, Soo never unloaded his guns properly. Rather than firing them off or drawing the bullets with a screw-rod, as was normal practice, he removed the bullet and powder by dismantling the breeches of the guns. Over time, a residue of unburned gunpowder was able to form in the channel he had made to allow the flash to bypass the barrel and ignite a blank charge in the ramrod tube. Thus, when Soo performed the trick that night, ignition of the residue in the channel allowed the flash from the pan to also ignite the charge behind the bullet not intended to be fired that was loaded into the barrel of the gun being used. Consequently, the bullet fired in the normal way, hitting Soo in the chest. The circumstances of the accident were verified by the gun expert Robert Churchill. Soo&#x27;s death was ruled &quot;accidental&quot; with a final verdict of &quot;misadventure&quot;.

After Chung Ling Soo&#x27;s death, the public was shocked to learn that he was not Chinese. Soo&#x27;s true identity was largely known among professional magicians. A year before Soo&#x27;s death, magician Will Goldston commented in an interview with &quot;Magician Monthly&quot; that the public did not question Soo&#x27;s identity because &quot;... he has always presented to the public that which they like and not which he might prefer&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Soo&#x27;s story is related by the detective in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s film &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005). Soo also appears in the Christopher Nolan film &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006). Soo&#x27;s story also figures prominently in Bruce Hartman&#x27;s short story &quot;Illusionists&quot; in &quot;The Philosophical Detective&quot; (2014). The story of his accidental onstage death is recounted by a character in the Ray Bradbury novel &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; (1957).

<text>Lake Couchiching ( ; from the Ojibwe &quot;gojijiing&quot; meaning &quot;inlet&quot;) is a medium-sized lake in Central Ontario, Canada, separated from Lake Simcoe by a narrow channel.

Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching are popular spots for fishing in summer and ice fishing in winter.

Singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot paid homage to the lake in the song &quot;Couchiching&quot;.

The Couchiching Institute on Public Affairs holds its annual conference on the shores of the lake every August. Camp Couchiching is also located near the lake.

==Geography==

The Trent-Severn Waterway enters Lake Simcoe by the Talbot River and exits this lake by the Severn River which empties into Georgian Bay.

The lake is long and slightly less than wide. The city of Orillia is located on the narrow channel connecting this lake with Lake Simcoe.
==Water quality==
In a 2012 study, the lake showed a microalgae density of 2.4 × 10^7/cm^2, with a high species diversity. The lake showed low total phosphorus and high organic carbon content, when compared to Lake Simcoe.

<text>Smoke City was an English band that blended acid jazz and trip hop, borrowing from Brazilian styles such as samba and bossa nova and some lyrics have excerpts in Portuguese. They are best known for their single &quot;Underwater Love&quot;, which was a major hit in 1997, after being used in a Levi&#x27;s television advertisement, &quot;Mermaids&quot; (directed by Michel Gondry). In 1997, the band released their first album, &quot;Flying Away&quot;, which included several hits such as &quot;Underwater Love&quot;, &quot;Mr. Gorgeous (and Miss Curvaceous)&quot; and &quot;Águas de março (Joga Bossa Mix)&quot;. Smoke City&#x27;s next album, &quot;Heroes of Nature&quot;, was released in 2001. An extended version of &quot;Heroes of Nature&quot; had three more tracks than the original, one of them being a cover version of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;.

&quot;Underwater Love&quot; is also a track on the soundtrack for &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot;, a surf video.

In 1998, the band contributed &quot;O Cara Lindo (Mr. Gorgeous)&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot;, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization.

The group disbanded in 2002.

Slant Magazine listed their album &quot;Flying Away&quot; #20 on their list of greatest trip-hop albums of all time.

<doc id="981779" wikidata="Q1849277" url="?curid=981779" title="Würzburg radar">
<text>The low-UHF band Würzburg radar was the primary ground-based tracking radar for the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during World War II. Initial development took place before the war and the apparatus entered service in 1940. Eventually, over 4,000 Würzburgs of various models were produced. It took its name from the city of Würzburg.

There were two primary models of the system. The first Würzburg was a transportable model that could be folded for transit and then brought into operation quickly after emplacement and levelling. The A models began entering service in May 1940 and saw several updated versions over the next year to improve accuracy, notably the addition of conical scanning in the D model of 1941. The larger Würzburg-&quot;Riese&quot; (giant) was based on the D model but used a much larger parabolic reflector to further improve resolution at the cost of no longer being mobile.

As one of German&#x27;s primary radars, the British spent considerable effort countering it. This culminated in February 1942 with Operation Biting, in which components of an operational A model were captured. Using information from these components, the Royal Air Force introduced &quot;Window&quot; chaff and a series of white noise radar jammers known as &quot;Carpet&quot; to interfere with their operation. Late in the war, the British introduced the first jammers using the more advanced angle deception jamming.

==Development==
In January 1934, Telefunken met with German radar researchers, notably Dr. Rudolf Kühnhold of the Communications Research Institute of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and Dr. Hans Hollmann, an expert in microwaves, who informed them of their work on an early warning radar. Telefunken&#x27;s director of research, Dr. Wilhelm Runge, was unimpressed and dismissed the idea as science fiction. The developers then went their own way and formed (GEMA) eventually collaborating with Lorenz on the development of the Freya and Seetakt systems.

By the spring of 1935, GEMA&#x27;s successes made it clear to Runge that the idea was workable after all, so he started a crash program at Telefunken to develop radar systems. With Lorenz already making progress on early warning devices, Runge had the Telefunken team concentrate on a short-range gun laying system instead. Management apparently felt it to be as uninteresting as Runge had a year earlier and assigned it a low priority for development. By the summer they had built a working experimental unit in the band that was able to generate strong returns off a target Junkers Ju 52. By the next summer, the experimental set-up had been developed into a prototype known as the &quot;Darmstadt&quot;, which offered a range accuracy of at , not nearly enough for gun laying. Attitudes changed in late 1938, when a full development contract was received from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

The resulting system, known as the &quot;FuMG 62&quot;, as well as the prototype system &quot;FuMG 39T Darmstadt&quot; were demonstrated to Hitler at Rechlin in July 1939. The Telefunken team developed an accurate system based on a klystron microwave tube operating in the range of —an extremely short wavelength for the time—with a pulse length of 2 microseconds, a peak power of and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 3,750 Hz. It had a maximum range of about and was accurate to about in range. Würzburg used a paraboloid dish antenna, which could be &quot;folded&quot; along the horizontal midline for travel on a wheeled trailer. The system was first accepted into service in 1940 and this basic layout were delivered.

==Operational models==
Several versions of the basic Würzburg system were deployed over the course of the war. The first, &quot;Würzburg A&quot;, was operated manually and required the operators to pinpoint the target by maintaining a maximum signal on their oscilloscope display. Since the signal strength changed on its own for various reasons as well as being on or off target, this was inaccurate and generally required the use of a searchlight to spot the target once the radar had settled on an approximate position. Nevertheless, one of the first Würzburgs in service directly assisted in the shooting-down of an aircraft in May 1940 by orally relaying commands to a flak unit. An experimental &quot;Würzburg B&quot; added an infra-red detector for fine tuning, but in general these devices proved to be unusable and production was discontinued.

&quot;Würzburg C&quot; featured lobe switching to improve aiming accuracy. It sent the signal out of one of two dipole antennas placed slightly on either side of the centreline of the parabolic reflector. The signal was switched rapidly between the two dipoles, sending the signal slightly to one side of the line of sight or the other. After slightly delaying the signal from one of the dipoles, the returns were sent to an oscilloscope display. The result appeared as two closely separated &quot;blips&quot; which the operator attempted to keep at the same height on the display by turning the antenna towards the shorter blip. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in the target position and operators could achieve accuracy on the order of a degree. Changes in signal strength, due to changes in the reflection of the target, affected both lobes equally, eliminating common-mode reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States&#x27;s first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.

The &quot;Würzburg D&quot; was introduced in 1941 and added a conical scanning system using an offset receiver feed called a &quot;Quirl&quot; (German for whisk) that spun at The resulting signal was slightly offset from the centreline of the dish, rotating around the axis and overlapping it in the center. If the target aircraft was entered in the line of sight the signal was steady, but if it was off-axis the strength would increase and decrease. The timing of the increases indicated the direction of the aircraft relative to the centreline. Because this variation in signal was present even when the antenna was very close to centered, the angular resolution was smaller than the beamwidth of the antenna, providing greatly improved accuracy, on the order of 0.2 degrees in azimuth and 0.3 degrees in elevation. Earlier examples were generally upgraded to the D model in the field.

Even the D model was not accurate enough for direct laying of guns. In order to provide the system with much greater accuracy, the &quot;FuMG 65 Würzburg-Riese&quot; (known as the &quot;Giant Würzburg&quot;) was developed. Based on the same receiver circuitry and displays as the D model, the new version featured a much larger antenna and a more powerful transmitter giving a range of up to . Azimuth and elevation accuracy was 0.1-0.2 degrees, which was enough for direct gun-laying. The system was too large to be carried on a truck trailer and was adapted for operation from a railway carriage as the &quot;Würzburg-Riese-E&quot;, of which 1,500 were produced during the war. The &quot;Würzburg-Riese Gigant&quot; was a very large version with a 160 kW transmitter, which never entered production.

==Countermeasures==
As the radar was one of the most common in German use, the British spent considerable effort countering the system during the war. In February 1942, a Würzburg-A system at Bruneval on the coast of France was captured by British paratroopers in Operation Biting. Several key components were returned to the UK, which allowed the operational parameters of the system to be accurately determined. This led to the modification of existing transmitter systems to produce the &quot;Carpet&quot; system that broadcast noise on the frequencies used by particular Würzburg systems. Several updated versions of Carpet were introduced; Carpet II was the primary UK version while Carpet III was its US-built counterpart.

Operation Bellicose bombed the suspected Würzburg radar factory. The Operation Hydra bombing of Peenemünde did not affect the nearby Giant Würzburg at the Lubmin guidance and control station used for the V-2 rocket.

==Post-war use in astronomy==
Dutch scientists brought several of the surplus German coastal Würzburg radars to the Radio Transmitting Station in Kootwijk, Netherlands in the early 1950s. There, they were used in experiments important in the development of early radio astronomy, specifically the discovery of the hydrogen line and subsequent mapping of the spiral arms of our Milky Way Galaxy.

German radar equipment including two Würzburg antennas (obtained from RAE Farnborough) was used by Martin Ryle and Derek Vonberg at the Cavendish Laboratory from 1945 to observe sunspots.

Two FuSE 65 Würzburg radars were installed around 1956 at the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia. The first radar served until 1994 to measure solar radiation flux, and later was moved to the Military museum Lešany. The second radar was used to measure solar spectrum in range 100-1000 MHz. Later it was used only for occasional experiments.

<text>Rail transport in New Zealand is an integral part of New Zealand&#x27;s transport network, with a nationwide network of of track linking most major cities in the North and South Islands, connected by inter-island rail and road ferries. Rail transport in New Zealand has a particular focus on bulk freight exports and imports, with 19 million net tonnes moved by rail annually, accounting for more than half of rail revenue.

Rail transport played an important role in the opening up and development of the hinterland outside of New Zealand&#x27;s predominantly dispersed and coastal settlements. Starting with the Ferrymead Railway in 1863, most public railway lines were short, built by provincial governments and connected major centres to their nearest seaport (such as Christchurch and its port at Lyttelton Harbour). From the 1870s, the focus shifted to building a nationwide network linking major centres, especially during the Vogel Era of railway construction following the abolition of the provinces. Narrow gauge of 3ft 6in (1,067mm) was adopted nationally. Bush tramways or light industrial railways sprang up connecting to the national network as it expanded. Railways became centrally controlled as a government department under the names New Zealand Government Railways or New Zealand Railways Department (NZR), and land transport was heavily regulated from 1931 onwards. NZR eventually expanded into other transport modes, especially with the Railways Road Services, inter-island ferries and Rail Air service. NZR also had an extensive network of workshops. By 1981, NZR employed 22,000 staff.

In the early 1980s, NZR was corporatised as the New Zealand Railways Corporation and drastically restructured, especially following the deregulation of land transport in 1983. The Corporation became a state-owned enterprise (SOE) in 1987, required to run at a profit. In 1991, the rail, inter-island ferry and infrastructure businesses of the Railways Corporation were split off into a new SOE, New Zealand Rail Limited, which was in turn privatised in 1993, and renamed Tranz Rail in 1995. The parcels and bus service business units were also privatised, and the Railways Corporation continued to dispose of surplus land. The central government renationalised first the Auckland metro railway network in 2001, then the rest of the network in 2004, and finally the rail and ferry operations in 2008, creating another SOE, KiwiRail.

Today, services are primarily provided by KiwiRail and focused on bulk freight, with a small number of tourist orientated passenger services, such as the TranzAlpine, Coastal Pacific and Northern Explorer. Dunedin Railways also operate tourist trains out of Dunedin, and a number of heritage operators run charter specials from time to time. Urban passenger rail services exist only in Auckland and Wellington. Rail in New Zealand has received significant and ongoing government investment since re-nationalisation in 2008, with the two urban rail systems being upgraded. In 2021, the government launched the New Zealand Rail Plan, with funding for rail projects to come from National Land Transport Fund (NLTF), with KiwiRail remaining an SOE but paying Track Access Charges (TACs) to use the network.

==History==

=== Provincial period (1863–1876) ===
Railway lines were initially constructed by the provincial governments of New Zealand from 1863 onwards. New Zealand&#x27;s first public railway was opened in that year, running the short distance between Christchurch and the wharf at Ferrymead and built by the Canterbury Provincial Railways. The Canterbury Provincial Railways were built to the broad gauge of . In February 1867, Southland Province opened a branch from Invercargill to Bluff to the international standard gauge of .

====Gauge====

 gauge (internationally known as narrow gauge) was chosen due to the need to cross mountainous terrain in the country&#x27;s interior and the lower cost of construction.

Due to multiple rail gauges being used by railways built by provincial governments, the prospect of a similar break of gauge problem to Australia (where narrow, standard and broad gauge railways were built by different colonial governments) became a major political issue as the provincial railways expanded. In 1867, the House of Representatives formed a select committee to investigate the issue, composed of members of parliament from all across New Zealand. The select committee heard evidence from railway engineers who proposed a number of options, including building main trunk lines at standard gauge, while using narrow gauge for branch lines. Engineers cited the experience of Queenland&#x27;s railways, which had adopted narrow gauge in 1864. The select committee did not recommend making railway gauge uniform across the country, but did recommend narrow gauge if that were to happen, stating &quot;narrow gauge appears calculated to carry all the traffic for many years, and would possess the advantage of greater cheapness in construction; for this reason railways of this character should be encouraged.&quot;

By 1869, of provincial railways were open, with another under construction, mainly in Southland and Canterbury. Parliamentary debate focused on the question of whether the provincial railways could keep their wider gauges, while narrow gauge railways were to be built. Member of the House of Representatives (MHR) James Crowe Richmond, who had worked on the Great Western Railway and in railways in Belgium, became the most prominent advocate for a uniform narrow gauge nationwide. In late 1869 Francis Dillon Bell MHR and Issac Featherston MHR (also superintendent of the Wellington Province) were in London to negotiate the retention of Imperial British forces then in New Zealand fighting the New Zealand Wars. They were also tasked with investigating a uniform railway gauge for New Zealand. In 1870, James Macandrew MHR called for another select committee to investigate the need for a law to require one uniform railway gauge for the entire colony. Information from Featherston and Dillon Bell reached Wellington in August 1870, and the second select committee to investigate whether a law was required for gauge uniformity met from that month. By majority the select committee reported back to the house in favour of narrow gauge being adopted as the uniform gauge nationwide, and allowing Canterbury Provincial Railways to continue to expand its broad-gauge network, with dual-gauge track where narrow gauge met broad gauge. William Sefton Moorhouse MHR, former superintendent of Canterbury Province and advocate for broad gauge, and William Rolleston MHR, at the time superintendent of Canterbury Province, were in the minority on the select committee opposing the legislation. Despite this opposition, Parliament passed the Railways Act 1870 in September 1870, requiring all railways to be built or converted to narrow gauge, with an exemption of the Christchurch-Rakaia section of Canterbury Provincial Railways. Sections of the Canterbury railway network were converted to dual-gauge, including Rakaia to Lyttelton, with new branch lines built to narrow gauge. By 1878, all of the broad gauge network had been converted to narrow gauge.

====Vogel Era====
From 1870, the central government of Sir Julius Vogel proposed infrastructure including a national railway network to be funded by overseas loans of £10 million, under the guise of the &quot;Great Public Works Policy&quot;. Settlement and land sales to immigrants from Britain resulting from this infrastructure investment would pay for the scheme. The first narrow-gauge line was opened on 1 January 1873 in the Otago Province, the Port Chalmers Branch under the auspices of the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited. Auckland&#x27;s first railway, between Auckland and Onehunga, opened in December 1873. Vogel also arranged for Brogdens of England to undertake several rail construction contracts, to be built by &quot;Brogden&#x27;s Navvies&quot; recruited in England.

Vogel&#x27;s vision of a national network connecting major centres in New Zealand was never realised. Despite the abolition of the provinces in 1876, parochial interests often overcame national interests, and the government approved and built many branch lines to lightly populated hinterlands, instead of prioritising interprovincial main trunks. As a result, a number of routes first proposed by Vogel in 1870 were still not complete by 1920.

====Tramways and Bush tramways====
Bush tramways were usually privately owned light railways, usually for logging operations. Usually built with light tracks and light-weight rolling stock, bush tramways were usually connected to the national railway network and were often moved as the forest was cleared. The last bush tramway for logging native bush closed in 1974. Bush tramways should not be confused with urban street-cars, known in New Zealand as trams. In the 20th century, New Zealand cities had extensive tram networks. Most of these networks closed mid-century, being replaced by buses. There are now proposals in Auckland and Wellington for new light rail networks, New Zealand has no rapid transit metros.

=== Central Government control (1876–1982) ===

Following the abolition of the provinces in 1876, railway lines were controlled by the central government, originally under the Public Works Department, and from 1880 under the New Zealand Railways Department. A Minister of Railways was responsible for the department and was a member of the New Zealand Cabinet.

A few private companies built railways in New Zealand, including the New Zealand Midland Railway Company, Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, Waimea Plains Railway, and Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company. Only the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, nationalised in 1908, achieved any measure of success, with the rest being purchased by the Government before completion of their intended railway lines. One exception to this rule was the Ohai Railway Board in Southland, which was owned by the State Mines department and a local county council until its dissolution in 1990.

The first major route was completed between Christchurch and Dunedin in 1878, later extended to Invercargill the following year. The North Island Main Trunk, linking capital city Wellington with the largest city Auckland, opened in 1908 after 23 years of construction. At the network&#x27;s peak in 1952, about 100 branch lines were operating. Large-scale closures of branch railway lines began in the 1960s and 1970s. The network was initially protected from road transport competition under the Transport Licensing Act 1931, but this protection was gradually eased until its total abolition in 1983, along with the deregulation of the land transport industry.
The networks of the North and South Islands were independent of one another until the introduction of the inter-island roll-on roll-off rail ferry service in 1962 by the Railways Department, now branded The Interislander.

=== Corporatised ownership (1982–1993)===

In 1982, the Railways Department was corporatised into a new entity at the same time land transport was deregulated. The Railways Department became the New Zealand Railways Corporation. The Corporation embarked on a major restructuring, laying off thousands of staff and cutting unprofitable services. After the 1983 land transport deregulation, there was a substantial rationalisation of freight facilities; many stations and smaller yards were closed and freight train services were sped up, increased in length and made heavier, with the removal of guard&#x27;s vans in 1987 and the gradual elimination of older rolling stock, particularly four-wheeled wagons.

In 1987, the Railways Corporation became a state-owned enterprise, required to make a profit. In 1990, the core rail operations of the Corporation were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited, another state-owned enterprise, with the Corporation retaining non-core assets which were gradually disposed of, including a significant land portfolio. In many cases, the Corporation did not dispose of land due to Treaty of Waitangi claims and has continued to manage land.

=== Private ownership (1993–2004) ===

New Zealand Rail Limited was privatised in 1993. The company was sold for $328.3 million to a consortium led by New Zealand merchant bank Fay Richwhite and US regional railroad Wisconsin Central Ltd. In 1995 the new owners adopted the name Tranz Rail and listed the company on the New Zealand stock market and NASDAQ. Rail freight volumes increased between 1993 and 2000 from 8.5m net tonnes to 14.99m net tonnes carried annually, and then gradually fell until 2003 to 13.7m tonnes. Freight volumes then increased again to 16.1m tonnes carried annually in 2012.

Tranz Rail was accused of deliberately running down some lines through lack of maintenance. The Midland Line for example, which mostly carries coal from the West Coast to Lyttelton, was assessed to be in a safe but poor state by the LTSA government safety body in 2003, and has needed major repairs.

Tranz Rail was accused of forcing freight onto the roads, and in 2002 introduced a containerisation scheme that assumed that most freight would be carried in containers on unit trains made up of fixed &quot;consists&quot; of flat deck wagons. Container loading depots were constructed at the major freight terminals. One of the reasons often cited for these policies was that the cost of using road transport to Tranz Rail was less than that of using rail because the road infrastructure is provided as a public good, whereas the rail network was a private good.

====Government purchase of Auckland rail network====
The government purchased the Auckland metropolitan rail network from Tranz Rail for $81 million in 2002. Tranz Rail retained time slots for freight trains, and the Auckland Regional Council was granted slots for it to contract the operation of suburban passenger trains. Auckland railway stations not already local council-owned were transferred to Auckland Regional Transport Network Limited (ARTNL), owned by the Auckland territorial authorities, which was merged with the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA), a subsidiary of the Auckland Regional Council (ARC). With the creation of the &quot;super-city&quot; Auckland Council in 2010, ARTA was dissolved and its role was taken over by Auckland Transport, a new council-controlled organisation.

=== Private and government ownership (2004–2008) ===

In 2003, the share price of Tranz Rail dropped to a record low on the New Zealand sharemarket, dropping 88% in value in 12 months as a result of its poor financial state and credit downgrading. The government then considered various schemes for bailing it out in return for regaining control of the rail infrastructure. Cited reasons included a &quot;level playing field&quot; for freight movements on road and rail, and ensuring access to the tracks for all interested parties.

Toll Holdings of Australia made a successful takeover bid for Tranz Rail, subject to an agreement to sell back the infrastructure to the government for $1. In exchange, Toll was granted exclusive use of the rail network subject to minimum freight and passenger volumes, payment of track access charges and its own investment in new rolling stock. This transaction took place in July 2004, and Tranz Rail was renamed Toll New Zealand. The government committed $200 million of taxpayer funding for deferred maintenance and capital improvements via a new subsidiary of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, ONTRACK. An interim agreement was signed by Toll NZ for track access; Toll paid a nominal track access charge while negotiating a final agreement with ONTRACK. These negotiations did not progress and eventually went to arbitration at the start of 2008.

=== Renationalisation (2008–current) ===
Instead of concluding a final track access agreement with Toll, in 2008 the government purchased the rail and ferry assets for $690 million, effective 1 July 2008. The new organisation created to operate services on the rail network was named KiwiRail.

Ownership of the national rail network is vested in KiwiRail Holdings Limited, with land owned by the New Zealand Railways Corporation. KiwiRail Network (formerly ONTRACK) is a division of KiwiRail that maintains and upgrades the rail infrastructure and is responsible for the control of the network (i.e. train control and signalling). Other rail operating companies using the rail network include Auckland One Rail and Transdev Wellington, who operate suburban services in Auckland and Wellington respectively, and Dunedin Railways, who operate tourist trains out of Dunedin.

KiwiRail released in 2010 a 10-year turnaround plan for the rail industry. This was accompanied by significant government investment in KiwiRail of over $2.1 billion during the period 2008 to February 2017. In May 2017, the government announced a further $450 million capital injection and that KiwiRail would be subject to a further significant review. The plan has been significantly undermined by the Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, Pike River Mine disaster, coal price collapse, coal miner Solid Energy going into voluntary administration in 2016 and major motive power issues with the new DL class of locomotives. Nevertheless, significant improvements in freight volumes have followed (other than with coal).

Two of KiwiRail&#x27;s major customers, Mainfreight and Fonterra, also invested heavily in rail-related infrastructure. Mainfreight allocated $60 million for investment in new railhead depots, while Fonterra invested $130m in a new rail hub complex in Hamilton and another planned for Mosgiel.

==== New Zealand Rail Plan ====
In 2019, the government began a &quot;Future of Rail&quot; review, and in December 2019 released a draft New Zealand Rail Plan, outlining changes to the rail transport industry. The draft plan proposes a number of major changes, the most significant being future funding of the rail network through the National Land Transport Fund (NLTF).

The final plan was launched in April 2021, confirming funding for rail projects from the NLTF, and the use of Track Access Charges (TACs) for users of the rail network, including KiwiRail. Some specific projects were also outlined as possibilities:
* Reopening the Stratford–Okahukura Line;
* Completing double-tracking of the North Island Main Trunk between Auckland and Hamilton;
* Increasing axle weight between Auckland and Tauranga to 20 tonnes plus;
* Standardising loop lengths from Palmerston North to Waikanae;
* Increase axle weight to 18 tonnes plus in the South Island.

==Current projects==
The City Rail Link is an underground rail line currently under construction linking Waitematā railway station to Maungawhau railway station in Auckland and is due to open in late 2025 at the earliest. Light rail networks are planned for Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

Advocacy group Greater Auckland proposed the Regional Rapid Rail initiative in 2017, including tilt trains with a maximum speed of 160 km/h. This network would provide passenger services linking Auckland with Hamilton, Tauranga and Rotorua. In December 2018, the Government of New Zealand committed funding to reintroducing a five-year trial rail service, named Te Huia, between Papakura in southern Auckland to Hamilton, starting in 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, the Te Huia service had been delayed commencing operations to sometime after 3 August 2020, changed from its initial announced opening date of March 2020. In 2020, the government announced funding for a number of rail-related infrastructure projects, mainly in the Auckland region.

A business case is progressing for a branch railway to be built from the North Auckland Line to Northport at Marsden Point.

==Operations==

=== Freight ===



Freight is carried by KiwiRail and provides the majority of its revenue traffic. In the 2017–2018 financial year, freight contributed $350.7 million in revenue or 57% of the company&#x27;s total revenue. Freight is mostly bulk traffic geared towards export industries, with general freight being largely restricted to containerised and palletised products on the trunk route. Major bulk freight includes coal, lime, steel, wood and wood products, paper pulp, dry and liquid milk, cars, fertiliser, grain and shipping containers.

Freight levels have returned to the level that they were at when the railway had a virtual monopoly on land transport, prior to 1983. In 1980 11.8 million tonnes of freight was moved by rail, in 1994 this had decreased to 9.4 million tonnes. By 1999, tonnes carried had increased to 12.9 million tonnes, slightly more than the 1975 peak. In the 2006–2007 financial year, 13.7 million tonnes of freight were carried. This equated to 3.96 million net tonne kilometres (or the number of tonnes of traffic gained in 2008–2009 compared to the amount of traffic hauled in the 2006–2007 year).

In recent years, the amount of freight moved by rail has increased substantially and has started to gain market share in non-bulk areas as well. Freight on the North Island Main Trunk line between Auckland and Palmerston North saw an increase of 39% in freight volumes between 2006 and 2007. The five daily trains on the 667 km line reduced truck volumes on the route by around 120 per day.

A 2008 study by the Ministry of Transport predicted that by 2031 rail freight volumes would increase to 23 million tonnes per annum or 70% on the 2006–2007 financial year. In 2018 the same report found freight levels had increased by 17% between 2007 and 2012.

=== Long-distance passenger services ===
As of 2023, there are only five long-distance passenger routes: the Capital Connection between Wellington and Palmerston North, the Northern Explorer between Auckland and Wellington, the Coastal Pacific between Picton and Christchurch, the TranzAlpine between Christchurch and Greymouth, and Te Huia between Hamilton and Auckland Strand.

Dunedin Railways operates tourist trains out of Dunedin, with frequent services on part of the former Otago Central Railway line and occasional services north from Dunedin to Palmerston. This service was mothballed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has since restarted with a reduced timetable.

Mixed trains were &quot;once the backbone of the New Zealand railway passenger system&quot; on branch and even main lines, but the last scheduled mixed train ran between Whangarei and Opua on 6 June 1977. With a &quot;rake of assorted wagons&quot; and one or two passenger carriages, often listed as &quot;goods with car&quot; in timetables, they were slow, often stopping and shunting wagons en route. In the 1930s they ran from Christchurch to Springfield on the Midland Line, and into the 1950s overnight between Christchurch and Dunedin. On the North Island Main Trunk they ran during the day while the expresses ran at night. On the Okahukura-Stratford Line they lasted to the early 1970s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, most provincial routes had railcar and locomotive-hauled passenger services. In 1965, 25 million passengers travelled by rail; by 1998 the number had decreased to 11.7 million. A number of services came to an end in the early 2000s, including the Waikato Connection between Hamilton and Auckland, the Kaimai Express between Auckland and Tauranga, the Geyserland Express between Auckland and Rotorua, the Bay Express between Wellington and Napier, the Southerner between Christchurch and Invercargill and the Northerner night service between Auckland and Wellington.

Two further long distance scheduled passenger services, the Northern Explorer and Coastal Pacific ended their services in December 2021. On April 12, 2022, KiwiRail announced the return of the Northern Explorer and Coastal Pacific services in September, alongside new multi day excursion trains at a later date.

Horizons Regional Council&#x27;s 2021-2031 Regional Land Transport Plan noted that KiwiRail is considering a &quot;connector service&quot; which would link the districts&#x27; populations to urban services. It also noted that rail service between Whanganui and Palmerston North could be established. The Plan proposes to replace the Capital Connection, a long-range commuter train, with a modern and larger train fleet that could operate at a higher frequency.

=== Suburban passenger services ===
Currently, Auckland and Wellington have suburban passenger services. In both cities, the respective local governments own the suburban passenger rolling stock and contract the operation of services to a third-party, in both cases Transdev.

==== Wellington ====
The Wellington suburban network has five lines: Johnsonville, Kapiti, Melling, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa. In 1938, Wellington became the second city (after the Christchurch service to Lyttelton) to have electric suburban trains, and from 1970 to 2014 was the only city with them.

From July 2016, the services have been operated by Transdev Wellington. Prior to Transdev, KiwiRail&#x27;s Tranz Metro division held the contract. Wellington&#x27;s suburban rolling stock consists of electric multiple units, with diesel locomotive-hauled carriage trains used on the Wairarapa service. All of the rolling stock (except the diesel locomotives) is owned by Greater Wellington Rail Limited, a subsidiary of Greater Wellington Regional Council. Transdev Wellington contracts KiwiRail to provide and operate the required diesel locomotives.

==== Auckland ====
Auckland&#x27;s network consists of four lines: Southern, Eastern, Western and Onehunga. All services on these lines are provided by AM class electric trains, the conversion from diesel being completed by the end of 2015 with the exception of the non-electrified section of track between Papakura and Pukekohe, where a diesel train shuttle service operates. Auckland One Rail operates the electric trains on behalf of Auckland Transport (AT). In recent years the mothballed Onehunga Branch was reopened (2010) and a new line was built (Manukau Branch, opened April 2012). Recent major projects include electrification of the Auckland suburban network and the building of the City Rail Link. Most Auckland rolling stock is owned by AT, which funds and coordinates all services.

==== Other cities ====

In 2017, the recently elected Labour-led Coalition government proposed to provide commuter rail in Christchurch and to provide long-distance commuter services from Auckland to Hamilton and Tauranga.

Other cities (Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill and Napier-Hastings) once had suburban services, but they were withdrawn due to a lack of patronage. The Christchurch-Lyttelton suburban service was stopped in 1972 when passengers were down to &quot;a busload&quot;. The last &quot;boat train&quot; for the ferry service to Wellington ran in 1976. The 10.5 km line to Lyttelton was electrified from 1929 to 1970. There were worker&#x27;s trains north to Rangiora; two in the morning and two in the afternoon. Dunedin had suburban trains to Port Chalmers and Mosgiel, withdrawn on 3 December 1982. The Invercargill to Bluff service stopped in 1967; in 1929 the sole Clayton steam railcar had been used. Trains ran the between Napier and Hastings but some were replaced by a New Zealand Railways Road Services bus in 1926, and soon they ceased altogether.

Worker&#x27;s concession tickets had been introduced in 1897, initially for the Wellington-Hutt service, and extended next year to Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin (and then between Westport and Waimangaroa). A 1979 NZR report &quot;Time for Change&quot; said that the Wellington suburban services revenue met only 26% of operating costs (Dunedin was 28%, Auckland 46%).

===School commuters===

Up to the 1930s and 1940s, pupils had to commute to larger towns for secondary education from places that only had a primary school; for example from rural Canterbury to Christchurch Technical High School. Another famous example was Sir Edmund Hillary who commuted by school train from Tuakau to Auckland Grammar School for three and a half hours, a one-hour and 40 minutes journey each way. School trains ran between Picton and Blenheim, allowing Picton students to attend Marlborough College (split into Marlborough Boys&#x27; College and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College in 1963). The service was cancelled when Queen Charlotte College opened in Picton in 1965, and those students remaining at the Marlborough Colleges switched to buses.

The NZR offered season tickets for primary and secondary school students from 1877, using funds paid for out of the Education budget, and from 1885 for students attending primary schools from a place lacking a local school. Premier Richard Seddon and the Liberal Government were keen to place secondary education &quot;within the reach of the poorest man in the Colony&quot; with an extension of the free passes in 1898 and 1909. School season passes increased from 8,720 in 1899 to 29,705 in 1914–15, when one in seven primary and secondary students travelled by train. Some pupils reached home after dark in the winter and had to milk cows before and after school. John Pascoe said that some children spend &quot;up to six hours a day travelling.&quot; Boys and girls were usually segregated.

==Infrastructure and mechanical==

=== Rail network ===

The New Zealand rail network has around of line, of which about is electrified. At the network&#x27;s peak in 1953, some of line was open. A 2009 study counted 1,787 bridges and 150 tunnels (totalling in length) on the rail network, but a 2011 study said there were 1,636 bridges, with a total length of and 145 tunnels, with a total length of . A 2021 Kiwirail report showed 106 tunnels and 1,344 bridges. Difficult terrain meant that some lines took years to complete, and has necessitated a number of complicated engineering feats, notably the Raurimu Spiral and Rimutaka Incline (the latter no longer in use).

The network has been the subject of major upgrading works on a number of occasions. The biggest of these were the Westfield Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk from Auckland to Westfield Junction via Panmure and Glen Innes, opened 1930, the Tawa Flat deviation in Wellington, opened 1937; the Rimutaka deviation to the Wairarapa, opened 1955; and the Kaimai deviation in the Bay of Plenty, opened 1978. All of these involved major tunnelling works, of close to each in the two latter cases. Significant infrastructure improvements were also carried out on the North Island Main Trunk in the mid-1980s, some as part of the electrification scheme.

As part of the 10-year Turnaround Plan announced in 2010, a number of regional lines were placed under threat of closure: all lines in Northland that form part of the North Auckland Line, the Stratford–Okahukura Line in Taranaki (mothballed since 2009), the northern portion of the Wairarapa Line, the Gisborne – Napier section of the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line (mothballed due to storm damage north of Wairoa early 2012, mothballed Napier – Gisborne from October 2012) As part of KiwiRail&#x27;s 10-year long-term plan, most new capital will be spent on locomotives, wagons and the Auckland – Wellington – Christchurch freight corridor.

===Signalling===
Six signalling systems are used in New Zealand: automatic signalling rules (ASR), double line automatic (DLA), single line automatic (SLA), centralised traffic control (CTC), track warrant control (TWC), and station limits. Signals are of the colour light type and operate on speed signalling principles, i.e. signals tell the driver what speed they should proceed, but not necessarily the route they will take. The Auckland suburban network is also equipped with European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling and train protection. Signalboxes and signalling were supplied by McKenzie &amp; Holland from their factory in Melbourne. The largest mechanical box in New Zealand was Frankton Junction, 85 miles south of Auckland, with 70 levers.

===Motive power===
==== Steam ====
From its inception until the 1950s, steam locomotives were the main motive power on New Zealand&#x27;s railways. Initially, steam locomotives were mostly imported from the United Kingdom from various manufacturers. The first major class was the F class tank locomotives, of which 88 were imported. From the 1870s, locomotives were imported from the United States, and generally found to be better suited to New Zealand&#x27;s conditions, although the pro-British public and politicians preferred locomotives from the United Kingdom. In 1889, NZR began manufacturing its own locomotives, starting with the NZR W class. Local engineering firm A &amp; G Price also manufactured a significant number of steam locomotives for NZR.

==== Diesel ====
Dieselisation of rail transport began in the late 1940s with small shunting locomotives. The first mainline diesel locomotives, the English Electric DF class, were introduced in 1954, but it was not until the introduction of the DA class locomotives the following year that steam began to be seriously displaced in the North Island. The last steam locomotive to be built by NZR, JA 1274, was introduced into service in December 1956, and by 1967, steam had all but disappeared from the North Island. Steam remained in the South Island until November 1971, when the last seven JA locomotives that worked the Main South Line were withdrawn from revenue service, steam in the South Island having been displaced by the DJ class locomotive.

Starting from the mid-1970s, the first generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn, being replaced by new locomotives, predominantly designs from North America. The General Electric manufactured DX class were introduced from 1972 to 1975, and the original DF class were withdrawn and the General Motors DF class introduced from 1979. NZR also rebuilt some of the DG class locomotives. At the same time, the newest locomotives of the DA class were rebuilt as DC class locomotives in Australia and New Zealand. The last of the first-generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Due to a decline in rail freight volumes following land transport deregulation in 1983, and the introduction of electrification on the North Island Main Trunk, no new mainline diesel locomotives were introduced in the 1990s. Some second-hand locomotives were imported from Queensland Rail in the mid-1990s and rebuilt as DQ class locomotives, most of these locomotives were then re-exported to TasRail, then part-owned by Tranz Rail. The first new diesel locomotives imported to New Zealand since the 1970s were the DL class locomotives from China, arriving from 2010 onwards.

==== Electric ====

In the 1920s, two short sections of railway line were electrified at 1500 V DC: Arthur&#x27;s Pass to Otira (electrified 1923) and Christchurch to Lyttelton (1929), both which have since been decommissioned. Electrification of the Wellington suburban network at 1500 V DC began in 1938 with the Johnsonville Line, followed by the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) as far as Paekakariki in 1940, and the Hutt Valley lines in 1953–55. The NIMT electrification was extended to Paraparaumu in 1983 and to Waikanae in 2011.

In 1988, 25 kV AC electrification of the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) between Palmerston North and Hamilton was commissioned, and a new generation of mainline electric locomotives, the EF class, was introduced.

In 2014, electrification of Auckland&#x27;s suburban rail network was completed, also built to 25 kV AC.

===Couplings===

The Norwegian coupling, also called chopper coupler, was the standard coupler used in New Zealand for non-passenger rolling stock and locomotives until recent years. In the 1970s a large heavy-duty version of the chopper coupler was developed, initially for the DX class. Auckland&#x27;s AM class and Wellington&#x27;s FP/FT class &quot;Matangi&quot; electric multiple units use the Scharfenberg coupling.

The Janney (&quot;Alliance&quot;) coupler was first used on heavy coal trains and has been progressively introduced on newer rolling stock and rebuilt locomotives. A program of retrofitting older rolling stock has been underway since 2013.

===Workshops===
The New Zealand Railways Department had major workshops at Addington (Christchurch), Easttown (Wanganui), Hillside (Dunedin), Petone (Lower Hutt, near Wellington) then Hutt (Lower Hutt, near Wellington) and Newmarket then Otahuhu, (Auckland). All were progressively closed (mostly in the 1980s), leaving only Hutt Workshops still operating. A number of small maintenance depots also currently operate, for example at Addington, Christchurch.

In 2019 Hillside (Dunedin) which had been closed in 2012 was reopened.

==Accidents==

Safety regulation is the responsibility of the NZ Transport Agency. NZTA also investigates accidents and incidents with a view to ensuring regulations and rules were observed. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission &quot;may&quot; also inquire into selected accidents and incidents to determine the circumstances and causes and help prevent similar occurrences in the future.

Modern signalling, train detection and communications systems, as well as an overall decline in rail passenger traffic, has greatly decreased the number of fatal accidents occurring on New Zealand&#x27;s railway network.

New Zealand&#x27;s most serious rail disaster occurred on Christmas Eve 1953, during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, when a lahar washed away the bridge in the Tangiwai disaster. 151 people died when the bridge collapsed as a Wellington-Auckland express passenger train was crossing it. The next most serious accident was the Hyde railway disaster of 1943, when the Cromwell–Dunedin express derailed after travelling at excessive speed. 21 people died. The driver was later found to have been intoxicated and was jailed for manslaughter.

==Heritage rail==
=== Heritage mainline passenger services ===
Four heritage rail operators own and operate their own carriage and mainline-certified steam or diesel locomotive fleets. These are the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Steam Incorporated, Mainline Steam Trust and the Otago Excursion Train Trust (Dunedin Railways). These groups have operated special excursion trains on the national network since 1978, and have been allowed to use suitable locomotives to haul these trains since 1985.

===Heritage and museum railways===
About 60 groups operate railway heritage lines or museums, almost all members of the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand. They include street tramways and bush tramways as well as railways. Large-scale rail preservation in New Zealand got underway in the 1960s when many steam locomotives were withdrawn and branch lines closed.

Current operations of the heritage railway type include the Kingston Flyer, Glenbrook Vintage Railway, Bush Tramway Club, Waitara Railway Preservation Society, Weka Pass Railway, and Dunedin Railways. Dunedin Railways is a Council-controlled organisation (CCO) 72% owned by the Dunedin City Council and runs the &quot;Taieri Gorge Limited&quot; which is in length, and various other services around Dunedin and Otago.

All other lines are operated by voluntary societies. The Weka Pass Railway at is the most lengthy of these. The Bay of Islands Vintage Railway is in length, but is in poor condition; having operated its first trains through Kawakawa since operations ceased in 2000 for two weeks from 3 July 2007, the Society is now working on rehabilitating the track between Kawakawa and Opua.

== In popular culture ==
New Zealand National Film Unit Film Director David Sims completed a number of films on the history of New Zealand railways, including Main Trunk Century (2009); The Truth About Tangiwai (2002); Total Steam (1996); North Island Main Trunk (1995).

In 2004–05 Television New Zealand (through Jam Productions) broadcast &quot;Off The Rails&quot; a 12-part journey on the then current rail network from Invercargill to Northland presented by Marcus Lush.

<text>North Shields Fish Quay is a fishing port located close to the mouth of the River Tyne, in North Shields, Tyne and Wear, North East England, east of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The quay was established in 1225 as shielings village (seasonal huts used by hunters or fishermen) around the Pow Burn; the town of North Shields, where it takes its name from the shielings. The quay was originally located to serve the nearby Tynemouth Castle and Priory. The original site is largely derelict industrial land currently being redeveloped, which belonged to the original Tyne Brand canning company. The Pow Burn runs from nearby Northumberland Park and disappears underground at Tynemouth Road and the Metro urban transport line, eventually flowing into the Tyne.

The development of North Shields was restricted due to the neighbouring port, Newcastle upon Tyne, which was the region&#x27;s leading port at the time. Its trade guilds resented trade outside of the city, so that coal mined in North Shields within 300 ft (91.4 m) of the river had to be transported on land 8 miles to Newcastle to be loaded onto boats.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the North Shields Fish Quay High Light and Low Light lighthouses, which now are defunct, provided a line of sight for vessels entering from the river mouth. Before the north and south piers were built, many ships foundered on the rocks known as the Black Middens, which lie to the east of the quay and can be seen at low tide.

The site has an original Old High Light and Old Low Light as well as High Light and Low Light, called so because they were positioned low (at river level on the quay) and high (on the bank top some 150 ft higher (46 m)).

The present quay was built in 1870 to accommodate the increase in fishing boats after the introduction of steam trawlers. It is the largest English port for prawns. Its proximity to the Dogger Bank has led fishing boats from Whitby and elsewhere on the north east coast to relocate there. Adjacent shops include fish outlets and fish processing facilities, mainly of crab and prawn. 

The Fish Quay was once the biggest kipper producer in the UK, but the fall in herring stocks has reduced the trade to a single smokery. A number of traditional smokehouses still exist but have been converted to other uses, the area having been substantially repurposed to include residential accommodation, eateries and other entertainment facilities. However, although much reduced, a healthy seafood trade still exists with daily refrigerated lorry movements. 

Clifford&#x27;s Fort, located on the Fish Quay, was built in 1672 as a coastal defence against the Dutch, and also played a role during the Napoleonic Wars. The fort was named after Lord Clifford, a member of King Charles II&#x27;s Cabal. It is now a scheduled monument.

The Fish Quay declined in the 1980s as a result of problems in the fishing industry. Refurbishment of the area was begun by Tyne and Wear Development Corporation and then beginning in 2001 based on a consultancy report. The Old Low Light building has been converted into a heritage centre, which opened in 2015.

==Festival==
The annual North Shields Fish Quay Festival began in 1987 as a community event and by 2001 had been renamed Window on the World (WOW). It brought in big-name music acts and by 2002 had a budget of £350,000 and was contributing an estimated £11 million to the local economy. For 2003, on cost grounds, the festival became the Fish Bay Family Festival and was relocated east of the Fish Quay.

In 2006, North Tyneside Council decided to suspend the festival because of concerns about safety since the area was being redeveloped, and recommended that it should become a heritage festival. It has not resumed; the Mouth of the Tyne Festival, which is held jointly by South Shields and Tynemouth, is now the local annual festival.

<text>Margaret Alexis Smith (June 8, 1921 – June 9, 1993) was a Canadian-born American actress, pin-up girl and singer. She appeared in several major Hollywood films in the 1940s and had a notable career on Broadway in the 1970s, winning a Tony Award in 1972 for the Stephen Sondheim-James Goldman musical &quot;Follies&quot;.

==Early life==

Margaret Alexis Smith was born in Penticton, British Columbia, on June 8, 1921, the only child of Gladys Mabel Smith ( Fitz-Simmons; a Canadian) and Alexander Smith (a Scot). Her family moved to Los Angeles when she was about a year old. Her parents both became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1939, through which she derived her United States citizenship. She grew up in Los Angeles, attending Hollywood High School along with other future talents, including actress Nanette Fabray. Smith made her professional debut performing ballet at the Hollywood Bowl. She was discovered in 1940 at Los Angeles City College, acting in a school production, by a Warner Bros. talent scout.

==Warner Bros==
===Early roles===
After being discovered by a talent scout while attending college, Smith was signed to a contract by Warner Bros. Her early film roles were uncredited bit parts in films like &quot;Lady with Red Hair&quot; (1940), &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1940), &quot;Flight from Destiny&quot; (1941), &quot;The Great Mr. Nobody&quot; (1941), &quot;Here Comes Happiness&quot; (1941), &quot;Affectionately Yours&quot; (1941), &quot;Singapore Woman&quot; (1941), &quot;Passage from Hong Kong&quot; (1941) and &quot;Three Sons o&#x27; Guns&quot; (1941). Her first credited role was in the feature film &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941), playing the female lead opposite Errol Flynn. It was a &quot;decorative&quot; part but the film was very successful. Warners decided to build her up as a star. She had a support role in &quot;The Smiling Ghost&quot; (1941) and appeared with her future husband Craig Stevens in &quot;Steel Against the Sky&quot; (1941), the first time she was top billed.

===Stardom===
Smith co starred opposite Errol Flynn in &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; (1942), one of the most popular movies of the year. Her lead appearance in &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1943) was well-received and led to bigger parts.

After a cameo dancing in &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), Smith appeared opposite Fredric March in &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1944), and starred alongside Ann Sheridan in &quot;The Doughgirls&quot; (1944). She had another cameo in &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944) then co starred with Jack Benny in &quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot; (1945).

Smith co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;Conflict&quot; (1945) and Robert Alda in the George Gershwin biopic &quot;Rhapsody In Blue&quot; (1945). She liked her part in the latter because &quot;while a heavy of sorts I get to do the unexpected.&quot;

She was reunited with Flynn in &quot;San Antonio&quot; (1945) in which she sang a special version of the popular ballad &quot;Some Sunday Morning&quot;; the movie was a huge hit.

Smith appeared with Sheridan again in &quot;One More Tomorrow&quot; (1946) then Cary Grant in a sanitized, fictionalized version of the life of Cole and Linda Porter in &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946); the latter was another box office success.

Smith appeared alongside Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid in &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1946), then did a second film with Bogart, &quot;The Two Mrs. Carrolls&quot; (1947); Hopper described the latter as &quot;a typical Alexis Smith role&quot;. She later said of her Warners years &quot;more often than not I played the other woman.&quot;

Smith made &quot;Stallion Road&quot; (1948) with Ronald Reagan and &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1948) with Parker. She was top billed in &quot;The Decision of Christopher Blake&quot; (1948) which was announced as an attempt to change her image instead of being just &quot;a mirror to reflect others&#x27; emotions&quot;.

She co starred with Dane Clark in &quot;Whiplash&quot; (1948), was Joel McCrea&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;South of St. Louis&quot; (1949) then worked with Zachary Scott in &quot;One Last Fling&quot; (1949). MGM borrowed her for a Clark Gable film &quot;Any Number Can Play&quot; (1950) then she made one last movie with Flynn, &quot;Montana&quot; (1950).

In October 1949 Smith was granted a release from her contract with Warner Bros after refusing being loaned out to Universal for a role in &quot;Shoplifter&quot; (1950) (she was replaced by Andrea King). She had been at the studio for nine years, having signed a four-year deal in 1946 that had the option of going to 1953.

==After Warners==
Smith went to Universal to appear in &quot;Wyoming Mail&quot; (1950), a Western with Stephen McNally, and &quot;Undercover Girl&quot; (1950) a film noir. She played a shy aristocrat who is coached out of her staid shell by Bing Crosby to rival Jane Wyman in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; (1951), her favorite role. At Universal she made &quot;Cave of Outlaws&quot; (1951) with MacDonald Carey then back at Paramount was in &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1952) with William Holden.

She received excellent reviews for playing &quot;Private Lives&quot; on stage with Victor Jory.
Smith was in &quot;Split Second&quot; (1953) at RKO with McNally then went to England to star in &quot;The Sleeping Tiger&quot; (1954) with Dirk Bogarde for Joseph Losey.

In 1953 she appeared on stage in &quot;Bell Book and Candle&quot; with Victor Jory.

She began appearing in television on shows such as &quot;The Star and the Story&quot;, &quot;Stage 7&quot;, &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

At Republic she made &quot;The Eternal Sea&quot; (1955) with Sterling Hayden. She had no offers so signed to go on tour with her husband in a production of &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot; which meant she missed out on roles in the films &quot;Serenade&quot; and &quot;The Toy Tiger&quot;.

Smith was in &quot;Beau James&quot; (1957) with Bob Hope, &quot;This Happy Feeling&quot; (1958) with Curt Jurgens and &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; with Paul Newman (1959).

She also appeared on a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis radio (NBC) broadcast on January 25, 1952.

==Stage career==
While Smith was under contract at Warner Bros., she met fellow actor Craig Stevens; they wed in 1944. In her later years, Smith toured in several stage hits including the 1955 National company of &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot;, Jean Kerr&#x27;s &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;, &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; and &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, all co-starring her husband.

In the 1960s Smith continued to work on television with roles in &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Michael Shayne&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Governor &amp; J.J.&quot;, and &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;.

Smith appeared on the cover of the May 3, 1971 issue of &quot;Time&quot; as the result of the critical acclaim for her singing and dancing role as Phyllis Rogers Stone in Hal Prince&#x27;s Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;, which marked her long-awaited Broadway debut. In 1972, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.

Her stage career continued through the 1970s, with appearances in the 1973 all-star revival of &quot;The Women&quot; (1973), the short-lived re-working of William Inge&#x27;s drama &quot;Picnic&quot;, re-titled &quot;Summer Brave&quot; (1975), and the ill-fated musical &quot;Platinum&quot; (1978), which earned Smith another Tony nomination for her performance but closed after a brief run.

She starred in several regional productions of &quot;Applause&quot; and then toured for more than a year as the madam in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, including a seven-month run in Los Angeles.

She continued to appear on TV in movies like &quot;Nightside&quot; and shows such as &quot;The Lives of Benjamin Franklin&quot;. She also performed in nightclubs.

==Later work==
Smith returned to the big screen with star billing at the age of 54 in &quot;Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s Once Is Not Enough&quot; (1975) opposite Kirk Douglas, followed by &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; with Martin Sheen and Jodie Foster the following year and &quot;Casey&#x27;s Shadow&quot; with Walter Matthau in 1978. She and her husband appeared in Losey&#x27;s &quot;The Trout&quot; (1982. 

One of her later film roles came in 1986, again with Douglas when he reunited with frequent co-star Burt Lancaster for the comedy &quot;Tough Guys&quot;. Smith had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; as the mentally unstable Lady Jessica Montford in 1984, and again in 1990. She starred in the short-lived 1988 series &quot;Hothouse&quot;, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her guest appearance on &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1990. Her last film role was in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993).

==Death==
Alexis Smith died of brain cancer in Los Angeles on June 9, 1993, the day after her 72nd birthday. She had no children; her sole survivor was her husband of 49 years, actor Craig Stevens. Smith&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), was released shortly after her death. Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="981792" wikidata="Q737593" url="?curid=981792" title="Battle, East Sussex">
<text>Battle is a town and civil parish in the district of Rother in East Sussex, England. It lies south-east of London, east of Brighton and east of Lewes. Hastings is to the south-east and Bexhill-on-Sea to the south. Battle is in the designated High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The parish population was 6,673 according to the 2011 Census and 6,800 in the 2021 census. Battle contains the site of, and is named after, the Battle of Hastings, where William, Duke of Normandy, defeated King Harold II to become William I of England in 1066. For some 250 years after 1066, official documents referred to the town as (Latin) Bellum or (French) Bataille.

==History==
Prior to 1066, the area had been relatively empty and unpopulated. The nearest settlement was probably located in today&#x27;s Netherfield ward, within a large, wealthy, ancient hundred called Hailesaltede.

The town of Battle grew around an abbey, which was constructed on the orders of King William to commemorate the battle and atone for the resulting slaughter; a settlement probably already existed outside the abbey gates by 1110. The Abbey provided sufficient trade to survive in an otherwise improbable location for a new town and there remain some fine examples of Medieval domestic architecture, for example the Wealden-style hall-houses in Upper Lake, Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest and others in the High Street.

Battle was most likely the birthplace of two pre-eminent stonemasons of the late 13th and early 14th Centuries. John of Battle worked at Vale Royal Abbey and was then chosen by Edward I to supervise construction of some of the Eleanor Crosses, whilst Thomas of Battle was involved with construction at Caerphilly Castle, the Tower of London and Battle Hall.

Most of the area was heavily wooded and provided oak and other timbers for navy shipyards, power for making cannons (shipped to Portsmouth or Chatham), cannonballs and gunpowder. It later developed a reputation for the quality of the gunpowder produced in the area. The first recorded gunpowder mill in Battle was built in 1676 when John Hammond was granted permission to build a mill on land owned by the abbey. A gunpowder works was located in Powdermill Lane, the remains of which have been converted into a hotel. In 1722, Daniel Defoe described the town as being &quot;remarkable for little now, but for making the finest gun-powder, and the best perhaps in Europe&quot;. The Duke of Cleveland refused to renew the licence in 1874 after many mishaps, including one occasion in 1798 when more than 15 tons of gunpowder were left in the oven for too long and exploded.

In the past, the town was celebrated for the skill and innovation of its clock and watch makers. This included the development of the first ever electric clock.

Battle was the birthplace in 1799 of Eliza Acton, author of the pioneering &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; (1845). This sold well for the rest of the 19th century. Its lists of ingredients, cooking times and other innovations provided a model for the cookery section of the best-selling &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; (1861).

&#x27;Battel Bonfire Boyes&#x27; is claimed to be the oldest of the Sussex Bonfire Societies and to have the oldest effigy (a ‘head’) of Guy Fawkes, now in Battle Museum.

Battle mostly escaped the conflict during World War 2. Some bombs and incendiary devices did fall in the area, most notably on 2 February 1943 when 3 bombs were dropped on the town. Two of these failed to explode, but one did detonate, destroying two shops and killing two residents. Close to the parish church are examples of &#x27;dragons&#x27; teeth&#x27;, Second World war, concrete, anti-tank obstacles, constructed to hinder the progress of any enemy invasion forces.

==Governance==
Battle is governed at the lowest level by Battle Town Council, consisting of (when a full complement) 13 elected councillors who meet on the third Tuesday of each month. The council is responsible for street lighting, allotments, cemeteries and recreational areas. It provides a local voice to the district and county councils. It is split into four wards: Marley, Netherfield, Telham and Watch Oak.

Rother District council provides the next level of government, the bulk of which matches the Bexhill and Battle Parliamentary constituency. The council provides services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities, council tax collection and economic development. Since the 2019 local elections, Rother has been run by a coalition of Independent, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green councillors. Battle is divided into two wards and includes the neighbouring village of Whatlington. The North Battle, Netherfield and Whatlington ward returns two councillors (currently one Liberal Democrat and one Green) and the South Battle and Telham ward returns one (currently a Liberal Democrat).

East Sussex County Council is the third tier of government, providing education, children&#x27;s services, highways maintenance, refuse disposal, libraries and public health services. Following recent by-elections ESCC is under ‘No Overall Control’. Battle forms the major part of the Battle and Crowhurst Division which ever since 1992 has returned a Liberal Democrat as its County Councillor.

Battle falls within the Bexhill and Battle UK Parliament constituency. It has traditionally returned Conservative MPs to Westminster. The MP from 2015 to 2024 has been Huw Merriman (Conservative) who was Minister of State for Rail and HS2. After Merriman stood down Conservative Kieran Mullan was elected.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, Battle was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.

==Landmarks==

Telham Hill is 1.0 mile (1.6 km) south-east of Senlac Hill, and it was from Telham Hill that William the Conqueror first caught sight of the English army forming up on Senlac Hill, for the Battle of Hastings, 14 October 1066. In the late 19th century it was owned and farmed by Samuel Carter as part of his Quarry Hill estate. At the top of the hill is a mound of uncertain date and purpose.

The Abbey is known as Battle Abbey, and was dedicated to St Martin, sometimes known as the &quot;Apostle of the Gauls&quot;. The abbey was founded to commemorate the battle, and dedicated in 1095. Construction was initiated by a small group of monks from Marmoutier, France. The high altar of the abbey church was reputedly sited on the spot where Harold died. The gateway is the dominant feature of the south end of the main street, although much of the rest of the abbey buildings have been demolished or adapted for domestic living. The remaining cloisters, part of the west range, were leased to Battle Abbey School shortly after World War I, and the school remains in occupancy.

Opposite the Abbey is the church of St Mary the Virgin, consecrated in 1115 and enlarged since. It contains the notable alabaster tomb of the first occupant of the abbey after the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII: Sir Antony Browne and his wife. The church also contains early 14th Century wall paintings, fine monuments and brasses. The church contains the &#x27;Senlac window&#x27;, a stained glass window depicting the Battle of Hastings and completed in 1984. It also exhibits the 3.2m long Battle Tapestry, modelled on the Bayeux Tapestry and depicting how the town might have developed from 1066 to the consecration of the church in 1115. It was produced by 741 individual &#x27;stitchers&#x27; and completed in 2017.

Battle is famed for its old-fashioned High Street, with many shops and restaurants on either side.

There are three Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish:
*Blackhorse Quarry, a site of palaeontological interest which has produced many fossil bones and teeth, including those of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and crocodiles.
*Hemingfold Meadow is a site of biological interest consisting of two meadows with nationally rare grassland species.
*Darwell Wood, another site of biological importance as an example of hornbeam coppice with oak standards is partially within the parish.
==Transport==
Battle is linked to Hastings and London by the A2100 and A21.

Battle railway station lies on the Hastings Line, north of Crowhurst and south of Robertsbridge. It is managed by, and the services are provided by, Southeastern. It was designed by William Tess and is a fine example of Victorian Gothic revival architecture; it has been listed as Grade 2 by Historic England.

There was once a station called Mountfield Halt between Battle and Robertsbridge, but this closed on 6 October 1969.

==Popular culture==
The immediate area was home to notable twentieth-century authors, including Sheila Kaye-Smith and Elizabeth Jane Howard, and is featured in their books. In the first half of the last century Marriott Edgar (who came to live and to die at Battle) was well known for his witty verses, particularly in association with Stanley Holloway. In Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;, Battle is the hometown of its main character, Kenneth Toomey, where Toomey&#x27;s father has a dental surgery.

Battle is referenced in songs by the alternative rock band Keane, as several of the members grew up in the town. In the song &quot;Sovereign Light Cafe&quot; from the album Strangeland, Powdermill Lane and the battlegrounds are mentioned. &quot;Snowed Under&quot; names Manser&#x27;s Shaw; &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; does not mention it, but is widely believed to refer to it too.

British and Irish Lion Granville Coghlan was born in Battle and later became a schoolmaster.

<text>In mathematics, or specifically, in differential topology, Ehresmann&#x27;s lemma or Ehresmann&#x27;s fibration theorem states that if a smooth mapping formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 are smooth manifolds, is
# a surjective submersion, and
# a proper map (in particular, this condition is always satisfied if &quot;M&quot; is compact),

then it is a locally trivial fibration. This is a foundational result in differential topology due to Charles Ehresmann, and has many variants.

<text>Orpington railway station is on the South Eastern Main Line, serving the town of Orpington in the London Borough of Bromley, south-east London. It is down the line from London Charing Cross and is situated between and stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 6.

== History ==


The station was opened on 2 March 1868 by the South Eastern Railway (SER), when the SER opened its cut-off line between Chislehurst and Sevenoaks. Previously, trains between London and Tunbridge Wells had taken a circuitous route via Redhill. The line was widened and the station rebuilt in 1904, expanding to six platforms. Third rail electrification reached Orpington in 1925, and extended to Sevenoaks in 1935.

About this time the Southern Heights Light Railway was proposed, which would have diverged from the main line south of Orpington and finished at . Crofton Roman Villa was partly destroyed by a railway cutting in the late 1800s but was rediscovered in 1926 when work was carried out to the area to the west of the station entrance as an entrance to a new council building.

Platforms 7 and 8 were built in the early 1990s on the site of former carriage sidings. In 2008, the station became fully accessible following the opening of a new footbridge providing lift access to all platforms. As of 2013, the former steam locomotive shed (closed for steam in 1926; in use as sidings until 1960) is still standing, converted to offices (sited adjacent to platform 8). In 2014 the car park was rebuilt with 2 storeys to increase capacity.

==Layout==
The station has eight platforms. Platform 1 is a bay platform which is only used for extra capacity during rush hour and other periods of high traffic.

Platforms 2-5 are through platforms. Platform 2 is used for fast services to Charing Cross or Cannon Street. Platforms 3 and 4 are an island, 3 used by trains towards Ashford International or Tunbridge Wells and 4 by stopping services from Sevenoaks to Charing Cross or Cannon Street. Platform 5 hosts the Sevenoaks slows.

Bay platforms 6-8 are bay platforms for stopping services towards Charing Cross, London Victoria, Cannon Street and Luton/Bedford. At the country end, the four tracks become two. At the London end there is a four-road sidings, where trains are stabled and cleaned.

There are two entrances, both containing ticket offices and ticket barriers. The main entrance is on the platform 1/2 side (Crofton Road), while the other entrance is on the platform 5-8 side (Station Approach and the bus interchange). Access to platforms 3 and 4 is available via an underground subway (inaccessible for wheelchair users) or via a bridge opened in 2008 which incorporates lift access to all platforms.

== Parking ==
The multi-story car park with a capacity of 142 cars was inaugurated in 2014. Southeastern rail company funded the expansion with a cost of £1.9 million. Jo Johnson, who was serving as the MP for Orpington, as well as David Statham, Southeastern&#x27;s Managing Director at the time, were hosting the event. 

== Services ==
Services at Orpington are operated by Southeastern and Thameslink using , , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via 
* 4 tph to London Charing Cross (2 of these run non-stop to and 2 are stopping services via )
* 2 tph to London Cannon Street
* 2 tph to (all stations)
* 2 tph to via (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping)

Additional services, including a number of Thameslink services between to and from and via call at the station during the peak hours.

On Sundays, the services to and from London Cannon Street do not run.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 51, 61, 208, 353, 358, B14, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, school routes 654, 684, night route N199, Go-Coach route 3 and Arriva Kent Thameside route 477 serve the station.

<doc id="981797" wikidata="Q597658" url="?curid=981797" title="William Ogilby">
<text>William Ogilby (1805 – 1 September 1873) was an Irish-born zoologist who was at the forefront of classification and naming of animal species in the 1830s and served as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London from 1839 to 1847. He removed to Ireland during the Great Famine and later built the grand but architecturally dismal Altinaghree Castle near Donemana, County Tyrone. Mount Ogilby in Queensland was named for him in 1846.

==Birth, family background and education==
Probably born in County Londonderry in 1805, William Ogilby was an illegitimate son of Leslie Ogilby (c1764-1845) who owned a bleaching green at Lackagh in the parish of Dungiven. The Ogilbys had been active in the linen trade since the mid-eighteenth century, and William&#x27;s uncle Robert Ogilby (c1761-1839), having amassed a fortune as a linen factor in Dublin, bought the lease of the 22,000-acre Dungiven Castle estate and was reckoned &quot;the wealthiest commoner in the North of Ireland, possessing it is said between ten and twenty thousand pounds a year&quot;. The fortune of William&#x27;s father was more modest but sufficient to buy the 3,170-acre Terkernaghan and Altnachree estate in Donagheady, County Tyrone, in 1829.

Illegitimate births were commonplace among the Ogilbys in the early nineteenth century, and William seems to have been recognised as his father&#x27;s heir from an early age. He was educated at a small academy kept by a clergyman in Macclesfield before proceeding to Belfast Academical Institution and thence to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1824. He graduated in 1828 and was called to the Bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1832.

His examination performance at Cambridge was unimpressive, perhaps indicating he neglected the necessary preparatory work in favour of studying natural history and science. His interest in the natural world was of early origin and may have been kindled by relatives. His uncle Alexander Ogilby (c1756-1846) of Kilcatten House, Claudy, had a &quot;curious and valuable collection of fossils&quot; in his &quot;choice little museum&quot;; his maiden aunt Elizabeth Ogilby of Limavady &quot;saved from the ravages of the lapidiary&quot; a natural crystal which, weighing 70lbs, was in 1814 believed to be the largest in Ireland; and his older cousin, Leslie Ogilby, was an &quot;accomplished naturalist and botanist&quot; who successfully cultivated Ireland&#x27;s rarer native plants and whose bequest of 400 books on scientific topics was an important addition to the Royal Dublin Society&#x27;s library.

==Research and first publication==
Over the course of a fortnight in March 1827, while still an undergraduate, William Ogilby examined at Cambridge a living specimen of the species he called the &quot;whitefooted Paraduxure&quot;. He examined it again in London in August 1828, by which time he was sufficiently conversant with the organic structure of animals and the principles of taxonomy to recognise the creature as a previously undescribed species which he classified as intermediate between the common genet and the common cat and to which he assigned the name &quot;Paradoxurus leucopus&quot;. His description and classification of the animal appeared in a paper which was printed in &quot;The Zoological Journal&quot; of January 1829 and was the earliest among his many published contributions to zoological research. The species he identified was included in Coenraad Temminck&#x27;s 1839 monograph on the genus &quot;Paradoxurus&quot;.

Ogilby&#x27;s arrival in London gave him access to the works of Continental naturalists and to specimens of animals and birds held by the British Museum, the Zoological and Linnean Societies, and the East India Company. He later became a regular visitor to the museums at Leiden and Paris, and he observed animal locomotion and behaviour at the Zoological Society&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park menagerie, the Surrey Zoological Gardens at Newington, the Menagerie du Jardin des plantes at Paris, and in private collections such as that of Lord Derby. He visited Germany (notably Berlin and Frankfurt) on several occasions and the Cape Colony more than once.

The breadth of his knowledge of literary sources from which useful natural history material could be quarried was evident when he alerted Professor Thomas Bell to an editorial note in Swift&#x27;s &quot;Considerations about Maintaining the Poor&quot; referring to the importation of frogs to Dublin from England at the beginning of the eighteenth century.

==Zoological Society contributions and appointment==
From 1830 onwards, at meetings of the Zoological Society, he read explanatory papers or delivered commentaries on specimens donated to the Society&#x27;s museum. Some forty of his reports were printed in either full or abstract form in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot; and &quot;Proceedings&quot; during the years to 1841, describing and classifying new examples of mammals and birds from Australia, Africa, the Americas and India. In the same period he also read similar papers to the Linnean Society and commented on fossil specimens to the Geological Society. Publication of his classifications established and named the several genera &quot;Cynictis&quot; (1833), &quot;Madoqua&quot; (1836), &quot;Pseudocheirus&quot; (1837), &quot;Chaeropus&quot; and &quot;Conilurus&quot; (1838), and placed many new species within previously established genera.

He chaired meetings of the Zoological Society from 1836 and by 1838 was not only one of its Fellows but also a Fellow of the Linnean, Geological and Royal Astronomical Societies. He was on terms of friendship with Charles Darwin, the Secretary of the Geographical Society, and in 1839 both men were elected to the Council of the Zoological Society, Ogilby becoming that Society&#x27;s Secretary shortly afterwards. In this latter capacity he conducted the Society&#x27;s correspondence, controlled and catalogued its museum, recorded the animals in its zoological gardens and made recommendations for their purchase.

After his appointment as Secretary his contribution of scholarly papers and commentaries to Zoological Society meetings declined. He last named a species (&quot;Cercopithecus tantalus&quot; – the Tantalus monkey) in April 1841, and his final classification submission was made in January 1843. He continued as Secretary of the Society until resigning in 1847. He had been unremunerated in the post and was succeeded by a salaried official.

==Recognition==
His &quot;careful researches which have thrown considerable light on the affinities of the Ruminant species&quot; were acknowledged in 1838 when George Waterhouse named a new species of antelope after him (&quot;Cephalophus ogilbii&quot;, or Ogilby&#x27;s duiker). In the previous year W. H. Sykes had dedicated to him (&quot;whose contributions to natural history are so well known&quot;) the discovery of a new member of the carp family in the Bihama River (&quot;Rohtee ogilbii&quot;).

In 1846 Sir Thomas Mitchell, after whom Ogilby had named &quot;Dipus mitchellii&quot; (Mitchell&#x27;s hopping mouse) in 1838, reciprocated by the naming of Mount Ogilby in the Maranoa River region of Queensland, numbering Ogilby among &quot;the individuals of our own race most distinguished or zealous in the advancement of science and the pursuit of human knowledge... sufficiently well-known in the world to preclude all necessity for further explanation why their names were applied to a part of the world&#x27;s geography&quot;.

==The order called Chiropoda==
In the summer of 1829, while studying the actions and organic structure of red howler monkeys, Ogilby noticed what had previously escaped general recognition: the creatures did not use their forelimb extremities to hold objects &quot;between finger and thumb&quot; because their &quot;thumbs&quot; were positioned not opposite but in the same line as the remainder of their digits. Over the next six years he gave particular attention to the other genera of South American monkeys and observed this characteristic as common to all of them. Whereas they had previously been regarded as &quot;quadrumana&quot; (four-handed), he believed they were properly &quot;pedimana&quot; (foot-handed).

Ogilby&#x27;s study convinced him that the presence and architecture of hands were key indicators of relationship patterns among certain mammals, and he proposed recognition of a separate mammiferous order to be called &quot;cheiropoda&quot; (possessing hands) made up of &quot;bimana&quot; (comprising only man), &quot;quadrumana&quot; and &quot;pedimana&quot; (comprising, respectively, monkeys of the Old World and monkeys of the New World). He presented the proposal to the Zoological Society on 8 March 1836 in his paper &quot;Observations on the opposable Power of the Thumb in certain Mammals&quot;. This was printed in the &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; in the following year and acclaimed by the systematist Hugh Strickland to be &quot;one of the most valuable and important memoirs ever communicated to this magazine&quot;.

Ogilby took the classification &quot;cheiropoda&quot; into actual use and it was recognised and explained, probably by him, in Charles Knight&#x27;s &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; of 1837. In 1838 he enshrined its basis in his 442-page book, &quot;The Natural History of Monkeys, Opossums, and Lemurs&quot;, published by Knight for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge as part of the popular series &quot;The Menageries&quot;. As was the case with other volumes in the series, it appeared anonymously and, although Ogilby referred to himself as the author and was credited as such in &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, his anonymity has resulted in misattribution. Anonymity on other occasions may conceal a substantial body of work by Ogilby.

Despite some initial support for an order of mammals defined by possession of hands, Ogilby&#x27;s proposal soon attracted objection – quickened in part, no doubt, by aversion to the proximate relationship between man and ape which it implied. He had anticipated opposition, observing that whereas &quot;the metaphysician or the divine may consider man apart from the animal kingdom, the naturalist must view him in a different light: anatomical structure and organic conformation are the only principles which the zoologist can admit as the foundations of natural science... Man is too closely connected with the apes to admit of being placed widely apart from them&quot;.

Sympathy for Ogilby&#x27;s order of &quot;cheiropoda&quot; waned. By 1863 the proposal to classify mammals by reference to thumbs alone was considered eccentric and &quot;has, as might have been expected, never been adopted&quot;.

==Nomenclature argument==
In 1833 Ogilby became a member of the Natural History Committee of the recently formed British Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1842 he was appointed one of eight original members of the Association&#x27;s working party to consider if rules could be devised to govern zoological nomenclature on a uniform and permanent basis. The other such members were Charles Darwin, Hugh Strickland, John Stevens Henslow, Leonard Jenyns, John Westwood, John Richardson and John Phillips; further members were subsequently co-opted.

When praising Ogilby&#x27;s &quot;Power of the Thumb&quot; thesis in the pages of the &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot;, Strickland had disagreed with some of its nomenclature. Ogilby responded in immoderate language, denouncing the alternatives proposed by Strickland as arbitrary, dogmatical, unfounded and unnecessary, whereupon Westwood entered the argument in favour of Strickland. Despite this unpromising backdrop, the Science Association&#x27;s working party found considerable common ground. A first draft of a regulatory code prepared by Strickland was circulated in February 1842, Darwin marking it with his comments and forwarding it to Ogilby (both men&#x27;s manuscript observations survive).

The draft was then discussed and revised in meetings attended by Ogilby in April and May, and a second draft was printed for presentation at the Association&#x27;s annual assembly at Manchester in June. The very existence of the working party attracted hostility at the assembly, notably from J. E. Gray, Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum, with whom Ogilby had a history of bickering over nomenclature. As a result Strickland&#x27;s draft was not adopted in Manchester but, after further revision to reflect comment by members of the working party, was included in the group&#x27;s report which was printed in the Science Association&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot;.

These &quot;Strickland Rules&quot; included provision for the name of a species to be changed if, as applied to the object or group which it represented, its meaning transpired to be &quot;false&quot;. Ogilby opposed such flexibility, believing that, once established, the name must remain constant although its application could change by convention. Words, he said, were no more than the expression of an idea and so long as there was agreement on the idea the original or literal meaning of the words encapsulating it had no importance.

He, alone among the first members of the working party, declined to sign the report, but the rules which it promulgated attracted immediate international interest, were reprinted in French and Italian and recommended by foreign zoological societies to be followed by their members. They were the first attempt at an international code governing language in any science, and to them every modern code, whether botanical or zoological, can trace its direct ancestry.

==Residence in Ireland==
Ogilby inherited his father&#x27;s Donagheady estate in 1845 just as the Great Famine was beginning to devastate Ireland. In December of the following year he tendered his resignation as Secretary of the Zoological Society, explaining that circumstances required his presence on the estate where &quot;I am myself giving daily employment to from thirty to forty heads of families to keep them from actual starvation&quot;. Once established there he became a member of the local Relief Committee and obtained a loan of £6,000 from the Commission of Public Works in order to reclaim parts of his land for agricultural purposes. Reclamation activity enabled him to employ daily between 300 and 400 hands representing, he thought, &quot;from 1,500 to 2,000 human beings who would otherwise have starved or been thrown on the rates&quot;. By 1860 he was said to have transformed &quot;wild and mountainous-looking country into one of the finest estates to be seen&quot;.

Although he largely disappeared from the view of fellow zoologists (in 1855 Edward Blyth wrote to Darwin asking &quot;What has become of Ogilby?&quot;), his interest in natural history continued. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1849 and of the Natural History Society of Dublin in 1862. When, in 1852, the Science Association held its annual assembly in Belfast, he was President of its Zoological Section and read a paper &quot;On the Geographical Distribution of Animals in Connexion with the Progress of Civilization&quot;. In 1857 he attended the Association&#x27;s meeting in Dublin, delivering a paper of similar theme, and in 1862 he submitted his paper &quot;On the Eccentricity of the Earth and the Method of finding the Coordinates of its Centre of Gravity&quot; to the Association&#x27;s meeting in Cambridge.

In 1830 he had married Matilda Doria, a daughter of Niccolo Doria, Marquese di Spineto, a Neapolitan refugee who had established himself as a teacher of Italian at Cambridge and acted as interpreter at the trial of Queen Caroline. In 1836 Ogilby named a particularly beautiful species of antelope (&quot;Antilope doria&quot;) in his wife&#x27;s honour.

When he took up residence in Ireland his wife initially remained at their house in London&#x27;s Hanover Terrace while suitable accommodation was built for them on the Irish estate. Following the death of her father in September 1849, she joined her husband in a rented property at Buncrana but died there a month later, aged 40. There were no children of the marriage.

A little over a year later, Ogilby remarried. His second wife, Adelaide Douglas, was a daughter of the local Rector at Donagheady, a niece of the Earl of Morton and a cousin of the Marquess of Abercorn. For the next twenty years Ogilby led the life of a resident Irish squire. He was commissioned a captain in the Royal Tyrone Militia in 1851, served as High Sheriff of County Tyrone in 1852 and enlarged his landholdings by purchase of a further 2,900 acres near Omagh for £30,500 in 1853. A county magistrate by 1854, he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant in 1863.

In the 1860s he considerably enlarged Liscleen Lodge, the house he had first built on his estate, transforming it to become Altnachree otherwise Altinaghree Castle. This extravagant structure, built with cut stone brought from Dungiven, resembled a castellated factory but became, albeit briefly, an attractive entertainment destination for fashionable Irish society.

For some years Ogilby and his family seemed well settled in County Tyrone. He lectured to the Omagh Literary Society, served as President of the Donagheady and Leckpatrick Farming Society, ran a successful home farm, won prizes for his short-horned cattle in National and Ulster shows, and engaged in extensive tree-planting. His plantation of deodars, covering 11 acres, was said to be the largest in Europe. However, in 1872 he discontinued farming and relocated his family to Dublin for the benefit of his children&#x27;s education.

==Astronomy, faith and death==
Latterly he gave his attention to astronomical matters. In 1868 he delivered a paper &quot;On the Motions of the Moon&quot; to the Royal Irish Academy, and in 1872 he published &quot;A New Theory of the Figure of the Earth&quot; in which he declared that, in pre-spheroidal form, the planets &quot;revolved in their orbits for countless ages before they began to rotate normally about their axes&quot;.

In &quot;A New Theory&quot; he confirmed his belief in a divine creator of life, damning the &quot;ignorant attempts which have been made to substitute a godless Pantheism for both natural and revealed religion; to dissociate the universe from its Creator, and resuscitate the defunct Goddess of Reason which the indignation of outraged society dethroned and buried some eighty years ago&quot;. He regarded the capacity for species to evolve as testament to the &quot;work of creation being complete and perfect in all its parts&quot;, the Creator intending that all forms of life should develop as necessary to perpetuate themselves &quot;without any resort to immaculate creations afterwards&quot;. He believed that humankind, unlike the beasts that perish, had been made &quot;the proud heir of immortality&quot; according to the &quot;inscrutable wisdom of creation&quot;.

He died at his Dublin home, 12 Earlsfort Terrace, on 1 September 1873.

==Children==
Ogilby was, by his second wife, the father of four sons (two of whom died in infancy) and five daughters. Of the surviving sons, Claud Ogilby (1851–94), led a life that moved from early promise to dissolute maturity. He abandoned Altinaghree Castle, which by 1894 was ruinous, and ended his days in a rented room in a public house at Donemana.

The younger son, James Douglas Ogilby (1853–1925), was a noted athlete. He was 100-yards victor (twice in 10.2 seconds) in the Irish national championships in each of the four years 1874–77, and he invariably won over that distance in competition with the English champions. He is said to have been, in his day, &quot;the most successful amateur sprinter in the world&quot; and also to have been unequalled in Ireland as a swimmer and diver. He originally studied ornithology but subsequently specialised in ichthyology, emigrating to Australia in 1884.

==Car production==
Between 1959 and 1962 they built a series of complete cars.

The first was the 1.5 based on an extended Riley 1.5 chassis with BMC B series 1500 cc engine. The two-door, four-seater coupé-styled body was built of glass fibre. It was capable of nearly and eight were made with a price tag of £1574.

Made in greater numbers was the 1962 SX1000 based on the Mini. The first cars were built by grafting the Ogle glass fibre body to a customer supplied Mini. The conversion cost £550 plus the customer supplied base car. Later in 1962, complete cars became available with the 997 cc Cooper version costing £1176. Any of the Mini engines could be specified up to the Mini Cooper S unit which topped out at . The cars were fully equipped and featured a padded dashboard for increased safety. It is thought that 66 were made, with Jack Brabham buying one for his wife Betty for their first anniversary. Following David Ogle&#x27;s death, it was decided to cease car production with the remaining parts being used up. A batch intended for the United States was converted to right-hand drive and sold onto the home market. It is thought the last one left the factory as late as 1964. The moulds were sold in 1966 to Norman Fletcher, a boat builder in West Bromwich, West Midlands, who exhibited a Fletcher GT at the 1967 Racing Car Show.

The final car was the SX250, an updated Daimler SP250 built in 1962. Two were made, but Daimler was not interested and the design was sold to Reliant where it became the basis of the Scimitar GT which was launched in 1964.

In 2012 a replica Ogle SX1000 was available from Nostalgia Cars.

<text>Shemaiah (, &quot;Šəmaʿyā&quot;; , &quot;Samaíās&quot;), or Shmaya (in Modern Hebrew) was a rabbinic sage in the early pre-Mishnaic era who lived at the same time as Abtalion. They are known as one of the &quot;zugot&quot; (&quot;couples&quot;): &quot;Shemaiah and Abtalion&quot;; Shemaiah holding the title of &quot;nasi&quot;, whilst Abtalion holding the office of Av Beit Din.

==Biography==
Abtalion and Shemaiah were converts to Judaism or the descendants of converts; by tradition they were descended from King Sennacherib of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Despite this, they were influential and beloved. The &quot;Talmud&quot; relates that once, when the high priest was being escorted home from the Temple by the people, at the close of a Day of Atonement, the crowd deserted him upon the approach of Abtalion and Shemaiah and followed them. However, Graetz has argued that neither Shemaiah nor Abtalion was of Gentile descent, although both were Alexandrians.

According to the Mishnah, both Shemaiah and Abtalion studied Torah under Simeon ben Shetach.

He was a leader of the Pharisees in the 1st century BCE and president of the Sanhedrin before the reign of Herod the Great. He and his colleague Abtalion are termed the &quot;gedolei ha-dor&quot; (the great men of the age) and &quot;darshanim&quot; (exegetes). Hillel the Elder was a contemporary of Shemaiah and Abtalion, and regularly attended their lectures.

Of the political life of Shemaiah, only one incident is reported. When Herod on his own responsibility had put to death the leader of the national party in Galilee, Hyrcanus II, he permitted the Sanhedrin to cite him before the tribunal. Herod appeared, but in royal purple robes, whereupon the members of the Sanhedrin lost courage. Only Shemaiah was brave enough to say: &quot;He who is summoned here on a capital charge appears like one who would order us to execution straightway if we should pronounce him guilty. Yet I can blame him less than you and the king, since ye permit such a travesty of justice. Know then that he before whom ye now tremble will some day deliver you to the executioner.&quot; This tradition is found twice, in Josephus and the Talmud.

The tombs of Shemaiah and Abtalyon are located in Jish, a Maronite Christian village in the Galilee.

==In Josephus==

Shemaiah and Abtalion may be identical to Sameas and Pollion who are mentioned by Josephus. Shemaiah is named by Josephus under his Greek name &quot;Sameas&quot; (). According to Josephus, he led the Sanhedrin during the transition period between the Hasmonean dynasty and the rise of King Herod the Great. Shemaiah is described by Josephus as a disciple of Pollion the Pharisee, who, in rabbinic literature, is known as Abtalion. Herod held both Abtalion and Shemaiah in great honour.

One of the parties which stood for the inaugural elections was initially called Three Towns Together.

====Lancashire====
The term is also sometimes used to refer to the towns of Great Harwood, Clayton-le-Moors and Rishton, situated to the north of Accrington in the Hyndburn district of Lancashire.

===Scotland===
The term &#x27;three towns&#x27; is also used in reference to the towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston in North Ayrshire (historically Cunninghame) which together form one contiguous settlement along the eastern shore of the Firth of Clyde with a population of around 32,000; most local amenities are shared across the localities.

== Sudan ==
In Sudan, the term &quot;Three Towns&quot; refers to Khartoum, North Khartoum, and Omdurman.

== Poland ==
The term &#x27;three cities&#x27; (more commonly: Tricity, ) is used for the metropolitan area of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot on the Baltic Coastline (as well as minor towns in their vicinity). Their total metropolitan population amounts to around 1,100,000.

<text>Marcel Georges Lucien Grandjany ( ) (3 September 1891 – 24 February 1975) was a French-American harpist and composer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marcel Grandjany was born in Paris and began the study of the harp at the age of eight with Henriette Renié. At age eleven, he was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied with Alphonse Hasselmans, winning the coveted Premier Prix at age thirteen.

===Career===
At seventeen he made his debut with the Concerts Lamoureux Orchestra, and gave his first solo recital, winning immediate acclaim. He appeared with Maurice Ravel in Paris in 1913. His London debut was in 1922 and his New York debut in 1924. He appeared as soloist with major orchestras under the direction of Gabriel Pierné, Alfred Cortot, Walter Damrosch, Serge Koussevitzky, George Szell, Fritz Reiner and Vladimir Golschmann, among others.

From 1921 to 1926, he headed the harp department of the Fontainebleau Summer School. He moved to the United States in 1936 and was appointed head of the Harp Department at the Juilliard School in 1938, where he taught until his death in 1975. In 1943 he was chosen to organize the harp department of the Conservatoire de musique et d&#x27;art dramatique à Montréal, and for the next twenty years he traveled monthly from New York to Montréal. He was also head of the harp department at the Manhattan School of Music from 1956 to 1967. Notable students include American harpists Nancy Allen, Catherine Gotthoffer, and Eileen Malone. He also taught Anna Clark, the second wife of William A. Clark; she was also his patron.

At the First International Harp Contest in Israel in 1959, Pierre Jamet of France proposed the formation of an international association of harpists. Grandjany undertook to see what he could do in the United States and chaired a committee of leading harpists. The Founding Committee met for the first time on 3 December 1962 in his apartment at 235 W. 71 St, Apartment 32. Over the years, he was a member of the Board of Directors, Regional Director, Chapter Chairman and President of the New York Chapter. He generously performed at AHS conferences; in 1964 at the first conference and in 1967, a solo recital which was his last public performance. He supported the educational goals of the Society vigorously and delighted in the American Harp Society&#x27;s growth and community. He died in New York City.

<doc id="981852" wikidata="Q4852693" url="?curid=981852" title="Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art">
<text>Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (also known simply as (the) Baltic, stylised as BALTIC) is a centre for contemporary art located on the south bank of the River Tyne in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. It hosts a frequently changing variety of exhibitions, events, and educational programmes with no permanent exhibition. The idea to open a centre for contemporary arts in Gateshead was developed in the 1990s, which was a time of regeneration for the local area—the Sage and Gateshead Millennium Bridge was also being conceived of in this period.

Baltic opened in July 2002 in a converted flour mill, which had operated in various capacities from 1950 to 1984. The architectural design of Baltic was devised by Dominic Williams of Ellis Williams Architects, who won a competition to design the new contemporary arts centre in 1994. The building features exhibition spaces, a visitor centre, a rooftop restaurant and external viewing platforms which offer views of the River Tyne. Baltic&#x27;s current director, the centre&#x27;s fifth, is Sarah Munro, who joined in November 2015. As of January 2022, Baltic had welcomed over 8 million visitors.

== Development ==

=== Baltic Flour Mills ===
Baltic Flour Mills was built by Joseph Rank of Rank Hovis to a late-1930s design by Hull-based architects Gelder and Kitchen. The first foundations were laid in the late 1930s, and although construction ceased during the Second World War, the mill was completed and started operating in 1950. Known locally as &quot;the pride of Tyneside&quot;, 300 people were employed by the mill at its height. The building was composed of two parallel brick façades running east to west, sandwiched between a foundation of concrete silos. The structure could store 22,000 tons of grain. The design of the building also featured a larger silo in which to store and clean wheat. The site was extended in 1957 by the addition of Blue Cross Mill which processed animal feed. In 1976, a fire forced both mills to close, but the silos remained in operation until 1984 to store a portion of the grain owned by the European Economic Community. Baltic Flour Mills was one of a number of mills located along the banks of the Tyne, all of which, due to their size, were prominent local landmarks. The Spillers mill just downstream from Baltic on the north bank of the river was demolished in 2011. Another large mill was owned by the CWS and was located just upstream of Dunston Staiths.

=== Arts centre inception ===

The opening of Baltic as a designated centre for contemporary art was part of the revitalisation and post-industrial regeneration of Gateshead&#x27;s riverside. The regeneration began in the early 1990s and transformed the Quayside into a centre of modern architecture, including the Sage and Millennium Bridge. In 1991, Northern Arts (now part of Arts Council England) released a five-year plan in which it stated its intention to create &quot;major new capital facilities for the Contemporary Visual Arts and Music in Central Tyneside&quot;. Northern Arts were keen to convert an old building into a centre for art, rather than build a new one, and the Labour-run Gateshead Council expressed interest in converting the old Flour Mills. Gateshead Council purchased the Baltic Flour Mills silo building, and in 1994 they invited the Royal Institute of British Architects to open a competition which would find an architect to design the new arts centre.

== Architecture ==

In 1994, Gateshead Council invited the Royal Institute of British Architects to hold a competition to select a design for the conversion of the Baltic Flour Mills. The objective of the competition was to &quot;provide a national and international Centre for Contemporary visual arts&quot;. The brief cited a number of similar examples of old buildings which had been converted into arts centres around the world, including a converted flour mill in Porto, Portugal and the Bankside Power Station in London (now the site of the Tate Modern). After evaluating a total of 140 entries, Dominic Williams – a relatively unknown architect who had only been working for three years – won the competition. He entered the competition with Ellis Williams Architects, his father&#x27;s firm. Andrew Guest remarks that this &quot;simple, honest, industrial&quot; design was an example of architecture which recognised the designs and context of the past. Williams and Ellis Williams Architects stated their intention to &quot;retain as much of the existing character and fabric of the building as possible&quot; while also clearly presenting the structure&#x27;s new purpose as an art gallery.

The conversion of the flour mills was a complex and technically challenging task. The grain silos were removed, leaving the brick façades unsupported, and a 1,000 tonne steel frame was required to support the remaining building. Four new main floors were inserted into the building supported by a row of pillars. Intermediary floors made out of steel frames and thin concrete were also inserted. These were designed to be removable as to adapt the building and create variable spaces for art. With 13 separate levels in total, Williams claimed he purposefully wanted to create a sense of disorientation for visitors within the building and allow an element of discovery. A spiral staircase winds up the building towards an open-plan office for staff. An efficient ductwork system was installed within the beams which carries heated or chilled air throughout the building. Such a design, conceived of by environmental engineers Atelier Ten, was uncommon for the time. The north and south elevations of the original building were retained along with the original &quot;BALTIC FLOUR MILLS&quot; lettering and red and yellow bricks. The east and west sides were fully glazed, capturing natural light and allowing views of the River Tyne. Additionally, service towers in the corners of the building, a rooftop viewing box, and a low-rise visitor centre were completed—these now comprise part of the building&#x27;s major elements. The building stands at tall. Glass elevators situated close to the exterior offer views of Newcastle, Gateshead and the River Tyne. A restaurant sits at the top of the building, built in a manner which still allows natural light to reach the top gallery floor. The building&#x27;s interior largely features glass, concrete, aluminium, Welsh Slate, &#x27;Cor-Ten&#x27; steel, and Swedish pine. The furniture, purposely built to be flexible and adaptable, was designed by Swedish designer Åke Axelsson.

=== Awards ===
Baltic won a RIBA award in 2003, a Civic Trust Award in 2004, and in 2006 was selected as one of the top 10 most outstanding arts and culture schemes in the UK as part of the Gulbenkian Prize. In 2012, it won the National Lottery Awards prize for Best Arts Project.

==Management==

The founding director, Sune Nordgren, was appointed in 1997. He oversaw the period prior to Baltic&#x27;s opening, including the construction of the gallery. After almost six years, Nordgren left to take up a new post as founding director of the National Museum for Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo, Norway. At this time, Baltic was facing financial problems. After Nordgren&#x27;s departure, a former Baltic chairman accused the centre of overspending on commissions during Nordgren&#x27;s tenure. Baltic&#x27;s situation was described by Arts Council England as having &quot;serious inadequacies in financial procedures&quot;. Nordgren was briefly succeeded by Stephen Snoddy, who had previously run a new gallery in Milton Keynes. Snoddy only remained with the organisation for 11 months, citing difficulties in leaving his family behind in Manchester while working at Baltic. He was succeeded as director by Peter Doroshenko in 2005. Doroshenko&#x27;s previous institutions included the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst and the Institute of Visual Arts in Milwaukee. He was brought to Baltic to increase visitor numbers and resolve the centre&#x27;s financial situation, which was criticised by Arts Council England and an insider as being chaotic. Doroshenko organized several exhibitions during his time at Baltic, including &quot;Spank the Monkey&quot;.

In November 2007, Doroshenko left the gallery to head up the PinchukArtCentre in Kyiv, Ukraine. He stated that he believed he had made Baltic a more &quot;approachable and visitor friendly place.&quot; However, &quot;Design Week&quot; reported that there were claims that Doroshenko did not deliver the expected &quot;international programme of artistic excellence.&quot; Additionally, staff at the centre had complained about his &quot;intolerable&quot; and &quot;bullying&quot; management style. Godfrey Worsdale, founding director of the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, was appointed as director of Baltic in 2008. Worsdale oversaw the 10 year anniversary of Baltic and the hosting of the Turner Prize in 2011. He was awarded an honorary degree from Northumbria University in 2012 in recognition for his work on contemporary art after being on the judging panel for the Turner Prize. He departed in 2015 to take up a new post as director of the Henry Moore Foundation. Sarah Munro MBE became director in November 2015. She was previously artistic director of Tramway in Glasgow and head of arts for Glasgow Life.

== History as arts centre ==

=== Pre-opening events ===
During the four-year construction of Baltic, the new organisation arranged a series of events, publications, and artists in residence in anticipation of the centre&#x27;s opening. In 1999, after the silos had been removed and before the new floors were inserted, the shell of the building was used to house an art installation by Anish Kapoor. &quot;Taratantara&quot; was a trumpet-shaped installation of PVC long and was situated within the centre of the mill. This installation drew 16,000 visitors and marked a turning point between the building&#x27;s old purpose and its new life as a centre for art. In October 2000, Jenny Holzer&#x27;s &quot;Truisms&quot; – a series of aphorisms and slogans – were projected onto the side of the building. Kapoor and Holtzer&#x27;s works were intended to engage casual passers-by in an artistic dialogue. The identity of Baltic was also solidified by the publication of 16 newsletters between October 1998 and July 2002 when the centre opened to the public. A significant part of this branding was the use of the now registered typeface &quot;BALTIC Affisch&quot;, designed by Swedish designers Ulf Greger Nilsson and Henrik Nygren and based on the &quot;BALTIC FLOUR MILLS&quot; lettering on the building&#x27;s brick façade.

=== Opening ===

After ten years in the planning and a capital investment of £50m, including £33.4m from the Arts Council Lottery Fund, Baltic opened to the public at midnight on Saturday 13 July 2002. The novelty of opening the new building at midnight was intentional: founding director Sune Nordgren sought a dramatic gesture to herald the beginning of the new centre for arts. The inaugural exhibition, &quot;B.OPEN&quot;, had work by Chris Burden, Carsten Höller, Julian Opie, Jaume Plensa and Jane and Louise Wilson. Opie, who had previously assisted Dominic Williams with aspects of the building&#x27;s conversion design, contributed an installation consisting of nude outlines on the walls of floor of the gallery. Plensa&#x27;s installation featured a room filled with gongs which were available for the audience to play. Plensa also contributed &quot;Blake in Gateshead&quot; – a beam of light which stretched around into the sky. The installation was placed through the glass doorway of the ground floor. Burden constructed a 1/20th scale replica of the Tyne Bridge out of Meccano. Jane and Louise Wilson created &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, a video of a rocket launch. An early exhibit by the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara was also included. The &quot;B.OPEN&quot; event attracted over 35,000 visitors in the first week. A live art performance, including Tatsumi Orimito&#x27;s &quot;Bread Man&quot; and Anne Bjerge Hansen&#x27;s &quot;Moving Bakery&quot;, took place during the opening weekend, in which bread was handed out to passers-by in memory of the Baltic Flour Mill&#x27;s history. When BALTIC opened, there was a target set for 250,000 visitors a year. It achieved one million visitors in its first year, and by its 10-year anniversary in 2012, 4 million people had visited.

=== Notable events ===

==== &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; ====
On 20 September 2007, Baltic management contacted Northumbria Police for advice regarding whether or not a photograph should be displayed as part of the &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; installation, a forthcoming exhibition by American photographer Nan Goldin. The photograph, along with the rest of the installation, is part of the Sir Elton John Photography Collection. Entitled &quot;Klara and Edda belly-dancing&quot; features two naked young girls and had previously been exhibited around the world without objections. The installation, which had been scheduled for a four-month exhibition, opened with the remaining photographs whilst &quot;Klara and Edda belly-dancing&quot; was in possession of the police. However, it closed after just nine days at the request of Elton John. Although this had a determinantal effect on Baltic&#x27;s reputation in the short-term, Graham Whitham argues in &quot;Understand Contemporary Art&quot; that it may have given it a higher profile and greater publicity in the long-run.

==== Beryl Cook ====
In 2007, the largest survey of artist Beryl Cook&#x27;s work to date was featured in an exhibition at Baltic. Cook enjoyed widespread recognition of her art towards the end of her life; the exhibition at Baltic took place one year before her death. Her paintings depict everyday and familiar social situations in a playful, colourful, and &quot;portly&quot; style. Peter Doreshenko, the director of Baltic at the time of the exhibition, was keen for the gallery to reject the seriousness audiences may associate with it. The exhibition of Cook&#x27;s work was part of this populist effort to attract new audiences to the then financially-struggling gallery, whose visitor numbers had dropped to less than 500,000 and whose reputation was decreasing. Adrian Searle of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed the exhibition and, whilst acknowledging that fans would enjoy it, commented &quot;look too long and you may feel a bit queasy&quot;.

==== Turner Prize ====
In 2011, Baltic was the venue for the Turner Prize. This was the first time the event had been held outside of London or Liverpool Tate. The Turner Prize exhibition at Baltic attracted 149,770 visitors to the gallery – almost double the average attendance in London. The event at Baltic was also free, whilst Turner exhibitions at Tate Britain had always previously charged for entry. The winning exhibit was by Martin Boyce with the runners-up being Karla Black, Hilary Lloyd and George Shaw.

==== Judy Chicago ====
The first major retrospective of American artist Judy Chicago&#x27;s work was exhibited in Baltic from November 2019 to April 2020. The exhibition included her abstract paintings, records of performance pieces, and began and ended with a four-metre tapestry which portrayed the creation the world from a woman&#x27;s perspective. At the time of the exhibition, Chicago was in her 80s. Hannah Clugston of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the more recent featured works embraced the theme of death, particularly &quot;End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction&quot;, which is based on the stages of grief.

==== &quot;Baltic Open Submission&quot; ====
In March 2020, Baltic announced it would be closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic until further notice. In May 2021, it reopened to visitors with four exhibitions. &quot;Baltic Open Submission&quot; featured works created during lockdown by 158 artists from the North East. The 158 artists were chosen from over 540 original submissions and selected by a panel of three North East-based artists. The final pieces included paintings, drawings, and sound and video installations.

== Community and cultural impact ==
At the opening of Baltic, director Sune Nordgren outlined the role of the arts centre within the public sphere. He stated that Baltic should be &quot;a meeting place, a site for connections and confrontation between artists and the public.&quot; In an October 2002 lecture at the Power Plant Gallery in Toronto, Nordgren reaffirmed the importance of local outreach and explained his intention for Baltic to regard the local history and culture, comparing his intention to examples of modern art museums where this was not considered, such as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao (designed in Los Angeles and placed in Spain). From its inception, Baltic emphasised the importance of artist-public relationships and its role as a community hub. &quot;Participate&quot; initiatives encouraged people in the local community to interact with resident artists. A media learning centre in a local library was set up as an extension of Baltic&#x27;s community resources.

In a 2016 talk on Baltic&#x27;s 10-year strategic plan (officially named &quot;Untitled&quot;), the current director of Baltic – Sarah Munro – emphasised that the North East of England &quot;has always led, not followed&quot; the agenda for contemporary arts, and that Baltic had been a big part of this trend. She argued that the visual arts can be used to further the economic and social growth of the area, even amidst the backdrop of political issues and austerity. Baltic also launched an international award for emerging artists in 2016, which offered a £30,000 commission and an accompanying exhibition to four recipients. It was the first such competition in the UK to be judged entirely by artists: in 2017, they were Monica Bonvicini, Lorna Simpson, Pedro Cabrita Reis and Mike Nelson. Munro commented that the award was to foster &quot;a dialogue with our audiences at a local, national and international level.&quot;

Local university partnerships and graduate internships are also important to Baltic&#x27;s community and cultural influence. In 2011, Baltic and Northumbria University established an artistic partnership through the BxNU Institute of Contemporary Art, a centre for artistic and curatorial research. Christine Borland was appointed as Baltic Professor. A designated gallery space, known as Baltic 39, was established on the top floor of refurbished Edwardian warehouses at 31-39 High Bridge in Newcastle. It was designed by Viennese architects Jabornegg &amp; Palffy and housed artwork from students at the university. Baltic 39 was based at High Bridge from 2012 to 2021.

Their annual Self-Publishing Artists&#x27; Market (aka S.P.A.M.) takes the form of a lively programme exploring print culture and practice through talks and workshops with over 50 stalls selling zines and artists&#x27; books. S.P.A.M. Spreads reimagines the market in printed form and has included contributions by artists, activists, illustrators, zine-makers, writers and curators including Vanessa Murrell, Melody Sproates, Okocha Obasi, Stephanie Francis-Shanahan.

<doc id="981855" wikidata="Q4380191" url="?curid=981855" title="Blaschke product">
<text>In complex analysis, the Blaschke product is a bounded analytic function in the open unit disc constructed to have zeros at a (finite or infinite) sequence of prescribed complex numbers

:formula_1

inside the unit disc, with the property that the magnitude of the function is constant along the boundary of the disc.
Blaschke products were introduced by . They are related to Hardy spaces.

==Definition==

A sequence of points formula_2 inside the unit disk is said to satisfy the Blaschke condition when

:formula_3

Given a sequence obeying the Blaschke condition, the Blaschke product is defined as

:formula_4

with factors

:formula_5

provided formula_6. Here formula_7 is the complex conjugate of formula_8. When formula_9 take formula_10.

The Blaschke product formula_11 defines a function analytic in the open unit disc, and zero exactly at the formula_12 (with multiplicity counted): furthermore it is in the Hardy class formula_13.

The sequence of formula_12 satisfying the convergence criterion above is sometimes called a Blaschke sequence.

==Szegő theorem==

A theorem of Gábor Szegő states that if formula_15, the Hardy space with integrable norm, and if formula_16 is not identically zero, then the zeroes of formula_16 (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition.

==Finite Blaschke products==

Finite Blaschke products can be characterized (as analytic functions on the unit disc) in the following way: Assume that formula_16 is an analytic function on the open unit disc such 
that formula_16 can be extended to a continuous function on the closed unit disc

: formula_20

that maps the unit circle to itself. Then formula_16 is equal to a finite Blaschke product

:formula_22

where formula_23 lies on the unit circle and formula_24 is the multiplicity of the zero formula_25, 
formula_26. In particular, if formula_16 satisfies the condition above and has no zeros inside the unit circle, then formula_16 is constant (this fact is also a consequence of the maximum principle for harmonic functions, applied to the harmonic function formula_29.

<doc id="981857" wikidata="Q1674578" url="?curid=981857" title="Ispell">
<text>Ispell is a spelling checker for Unix that supports most Western languages. It offers several interfaces, including a programmatic interface for use by editors such as Emacs. Unlike GNU Aspell, ispell will only suggest corrections that are based on a Damerau–Levenshtein distance of 1; it will not attempt to guess more distant corrections based on English pronunciation rules.

Ispell has a very long history that can be traced back to a program that was originally written in 1971 in PDP-10 Assembly language by R. E. Gorin, and later ported to the C programming language and expanded by many others. It is currently maintained by Geoff Kuenning. The generalized affix description system introduced by ispell has since been imitated by other spelling checkers such as MySpell.

Like most computerized spelling checkers, ispell works by reading an input file word by word, stopping when a word is not found in its dictionary. Ispell then attempts to generate a list of possible corrections and presents the incorrect word and any suggestions to the user, who can then choose a correction, replace the word with a new one, leave it unchanged, or add it to the dictionary.

Ispell pioneered the idea of a programming interface, which was originally intended for use by Emacs. Other applications have since used the feature to add spell-checking to their own interface, and GNU Aspell has adopted the same interface so that it can be used with the same set of applications.

There are ispell dictionaries for most widely spoken Western languages.

Ispell is available under a specific open-source license.

<text>The State Anthem of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was the anthem of Moldova whem it was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. Adopted in 1945, the music was composed by the composer Ștefan Neaga, and the original lyrics were written by the poets Emilian Bukov and Bogdan Istru.

In 1989, the music and the lyrics of the anthem were modified by First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia Ivan Bodiul and composer Eduard Lazarev. As with other anthems of Soviet Socialist Republics after de-Stalinization, the lyrics removed references to Joseph Stalin. However, unlike the other anthems, the music for &quot;Moldova Sovietică&quot; was also altered, removing the original three-stanza structure in favour of a single-stanza three-part structure.

==History==
In 1945, the Soviet Moldavian composer Ștefan Neaga composed the melody to &quot;Moldova Sovietică&quot;, and the poets Emil Bukov and Bogdan Istru wrote the lyrics. Their works won national musical contest in their region, and they were selected to be the Moldavian anthem. Through this musical work, Neaga became well-respected among the Moldavian people.
Moldovan politician and historian Valeriu Passat ro] stated in his exhibition, &quot;13 ani de Stalinism. RSS Moldovenească în anii 1940–1953&quot; (13 Years of Stalinism, Moldavian SSR in years 1940–1953) that Iosif Mordoveț ro] forced the authors to write the anthem.

According to Vladimir Poțeluev, the anthem was created by an order made by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in Moscow, after the annexation of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Supreme Soviet also said that the top brass (e.g. Stalin &quot;et al.&quot;) set multiple rules for the writers of the lyrics:
* Mention to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
* Mention to the &quot;liberation from the yoke of capitalism&quot;.
* Mention to the development of infrastructure under the Soviets.
* Mention to the unity of Moldavian people with the rest of the union (something typical in the anthems of the Soviet republics).
* Mention to the total expulsion of fascists on Moldavian Territory (Soviet victory over Adolf Hitler).

===De-Stalinization===
When Stalin died in 1953, the state anthems were muted by Nikita Khrushchev and his nation-wide de-Stalinization policy. For around two decades, the Moldavian SSR anthem did not officially contain lyrics, as it contained mentions of Stalin.

In 1977, the Soviet Union adopted a new constitution, which allowed the replacement of the lyrics of the national anthem and the anthems of the constituent republics, including Moldavia. Ivan Bodiul decided to shorten the anthem, so he, along with composer Eduard Lazarev, modified the original musical composition made by Neaga. The new composition maintained the music of the verses, added an introduction, an &quot;intermezzo&quot;, and in the end a variation of the original refrain. However, this new composition was not well-received by others.

==Lyrics==
Moldovan historian Valeriu Pasat stated that the authors of the anthem were ordered to write then by General Iosif Mordoveț, likely due to dictator Ivan Bodiul and de-Stalinization.

===Recordings of Stalinist version===
There had been no proper full recordings of the original Stalin-era lyrics to the anthem; the only recordings intended for the original anthem contained discrepancies between the recording of the original lyrics recorded by the Brass Band of the USSR Ministry of Defense in 1968, and the recording of the post-Stalinist lyrics recorded by the Choir of the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company of the Moldavian SSR. It had three verses—each with a refrain (which was the traditional scheme for writing Soviet regional anthems), though they had never been rendered properly.

In January 2016, it was discovered that the advertisement for the exhibition &quot;13 Years of Stalinism&quot;, organized by historian and politician Valeriu Pasat, featured the beginning of the anthem, albeit with slightly modified lyrics. Later, the first sheet music page of the anthem – dating back to 1947 – was discovered in the catalog of the National Library of the Republic of Moldova.

The full proper recording of the original version of the anthem was subsequently uploaded to YouTube, after uses that belonged to the so-called &quot;Ştefan Neaga Commission&quot; found recordings of the original lyrics.

===Rejected verses===
===Orthography===
The Cyrillic script was used officially for the Romanian language (also called Moldovan) during Soviet times. However, after 1989, the Romanian language in modern-day Moldova now officially uses the Latin script; only the breakaway state of Transnistria (internationally recognized as a part of Moldova) still officially uses the Cyrillic alphabet.

===Original version===


===Post-Stalinist version===
After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, like other SSR anthems, any mentions of the former leader have been removed; however, a new version of the anthem was not adopted until 1980. The anthem was rewritten from the typical three verses with choruses—like other SSR anthems—to a three-part single verse without choruses, which was used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The music was composed by Ștefan Neaga and was arranged by Eduard Lazarev, and the lyrics were written by Emilian Bucov and Bogdan Istru.

<doc id="981874" wikidata="Q917278" url="?curid=981874" title="Tokyo Godfathers">
<text>is a 2003 Japanese animated Christmas tragicomedy adventure film written and directed by Satoshi Kon. The film stars live-action actors such as Toru Emori, Yoshiaki Umegaki, and Aya Okamoto as the lead voice actors.

Kon was inspired by the 1948 American film &quot;3 Godfathers&quot; to make the film. Unlike Kon&#x27;s other films, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; is grounded more in realism. However, as is typical of Kon&#x27;s work, the film includes devices that are not straightforward, and Kon himself called it a twisted sentimental story.

&quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; was released in Japan on November 8, 2003, and in North America on January 16, 2004.
It won the Excellence Award at the 2003 Japan Media Arts Festival and Best Animation Film at the 58th Mainichi Film Awards.

==Plot==
One Christmas Eve, three homeless people—middle-aged alcoholic Gin, transgender woman Hana, and teenage runaway Miyuki—discover an abandoned newborn while searching through the garbage for presents, along with a note asking whoever finds the baby to take good care of her and a key leading to a bag with clues to the parents&#x27; identity. The trio sets out to find the baby&#x27;s parents, and Hana names her Kiyoko, based on the Japanese translation of &quot;Silent Night&quot; and literally meaning &quot;pure child&quot;.

Outside a cemetery, the group encounters a yakuza boss trapped under his car. After they rescue him, he gives them his business card and tells them to call if they need anything. He then invites them to the wedding of his daughter, who is marrying the owner of the club where Kiyoko&#x27;s mother used to work. At the reception, the groom tells them that Kiyoko&#x27;s mother is a former bar girl named Sachiko. He gives them Sachiko&#x27;s address, but the party is interrupted when a Latino hitman arrives and attempts to shoot the bride&#x27;s father before kidnapping Miyuki and Kiyoko.

At the hitman&#x27;s home, Miyuki befriends his wife despite their language barrier. During one of their talks, Miyuki confesses to fleeing her home after stabbing her controlling father when her beloved cat, Angel, went missing, believing that he had gotten rid of it.

While Hana searches for Miyuki and Kiyoko, Gin takes care of an elderly homeless man who is dying in the street. After giving Gin a little red bag, the man dies peacefully. A group of teenagers arrive and beat up Gin and the man&#x27;s corpse.

Meanwhile, Hana locates the girls. Looking for a place to stay, they go to Angel Tower, a club Hana had worked at before assaulting a rude and intoxicated customer years earlier. Gin, rescued by another member of the club, is also there. Hana confides that she became homeless following a lover&#x27;s accidental death. The trio later discover that Sachiko&#x27;s house has been torn down and that Sachiko is unhappy in her marriage to her husband, a gambling alcoholic. Miyuki then sees a message from her father in the newspaper proclaiming that Angel has returned home. Realizing her mistake, Miyuki attempts to call her father, only to panic and hang up before she can say a word. The group rests at a store until they are told to leave by the clerk.

Hana collapses, requiring the group to stay at a hospital. There, Gin finds his estranged daughter, who is also named Kiyoko, working as a nurse. Hana berates Gin in front of his daughter and storms out of the hospital, Miyuki following behind with baby Kiyoko in hand. Hana and Miyuki find Sachiko about to jump off a bridge. Sachiko insists that her husband got rid of the baby without her knowledge, and Hana and Miyuki return the baby to her.

Gin finds Sachiko&#x27;s husband, who confirms that Kiyoko is not his or Sachiko&#x27;s and was stolen by Sachiko from the hospital. Miyuki chases Sachiko to the top of a building. Sachiko reveals she became pregnant in the hopes it would bring her closer to her husband; when her baby was stillborn, she kidnapped Kiyoko from the hospital, thinking in her grief that Kiyoko was hers. Sachiko jumps off the building; Miyuki catches her before she falls, but Kiyoko is dropped. Hana jumps after her, catching the baby and clinging to a banner on the side of the building. As the banner begins to give way, a gust of wind miraculously slows its descent, allowing Hana and Kiyoko to land safely on the ground. During their reunion, Miyuki drops the old man&#x27;s red bag on the floor, revealing a winning lottery ticket. Back at the hospital, Kiyoko&#x27;s real parents thank the trio for returning their daughter and ask them to become her godparents. When a police inspector introduces them, the inspector is revealed to be Miyuki&#x27;s father.

==Production==
During the production of &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, a producer from Madhouse asked Kon if he had any plans for his next film. After completing the film, Kon took two months to write and submit a brief proposal, which was immediately accepted by Madhouse.

The original story and screenplay were written by director Satoshi Kon, and co-written by Keiko Nobumoto, known as the screenwriter of the TV drama series &quot;Hakusen Nagashi&quot; and the TV anime &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, and the creator of the TV anime &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;.
Kon had previously asked Nobumoto to write the script for &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, but she turned him down, citing her busy schedule.
The animation director was Kenichi Konishi, who had worked on &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot; while at Studio Ghibli, and the Studio director was Shogo Furuya.

While the previous two works focused on the progression of the story, this work prioritized the theatricality of the characters and their presence above all else in both the scenario and storyboarding.
Although the story and theatrics are quite comical in appearance, the film was created not to return to the old-fashioned manga interpretation, but to aim for a manga interpretation that lies ahead after going through real-oriented animation.

The film was produced in digital technology, and all of Kon&#x27;s subsequent works are digital animation.

==Themes==
The motif of &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; is &quot;coincidence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;, and the rough plot is about &quot;three main characters who are not related by blood but live together as if they were a real family, and through a miraculous coincidence triggered by a baby, each of them recovers the connection with their original family that they have lost.

&quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; does not adopt an overt &quot;mixing of fiction and reality&quot; motif, but a careful look reveals that the relationship between &quot;fiction and reality&quot; is conscious in this film as well.
What Kon was conscious of in his direction was &quot;meaningful coincidence&quot;, in other words, to create a chain of miraculous events to move the story forward.
Kon writes in the press sheet, &quot;This film is an attempt to restore in a healthy way the &#x27;miracles and coincidences&#x27; that have been pushed into the other world by the weapons of scientific logic,&quot; and just as that sentence says, &quot;meaningful coincidences&quot; and &quot;impossible events&quot; happen one after another in &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; .
In other words, the idea of this film is that the &quot;fiction&quot; of &quot;miracles and coincidences&quot; can be found in the seemingly real life of the homeless in Tokyo. The director&#x27;s aim is to portray a series of events that could never happen in reality with a sense of reality and persuasiveness that makes it seem possible.

Kon said: &quot;Homeless people, as the term implies, &#x27;have no home,&#x27; but in this film, it is not just &#x27;people who have lost their homes,&#x27; but also &#x27;people who have lost their families,&#x27; and in that sense, this film is a story about recovering lost relationships with families.&quot; Kon chose homeless people as his protagonists because he had long been interested in the lives of homeless people. One of the triggers for Kon to come up with &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; was the idea that they are born even in times of affluence, and at the same time, they are supported because the world is affluent, so they may be said to be kept alive by the city. The other idea was the idea of animism in the city, that even the buildings and alleys of the city may have a soul, and that the main characters step into the other world that overlaps the city. Based on a story in which three homeless people living like pseudo-families pick up a baby and try to return it to her parents, Kon imagined a story in which the trio enter a &quot;different world&quot; where strange coincidences occur in succession, and they recover their relationship with their families and society through their adventures, while another protagonist named &quot;Tokyo&quot; is watching over them. In fact, &quot;landscapes that look like faces&quot;, in which the outdoor units of air conditioners and windows are used as eyes and mouths, are embedded in various cuts, which could be said to be the figures of the gods of the city staring at the main characters. These &quot;faces&quot; are not visible from the perspective of the characters, and only the audience can notice them. Kon has also created a fiction here. The film&#x27;s background is a trick of overlapping two layers of information: &quot;the city scenery = reality for the characters&quot; and &quot;the scenery with faces that only the audience can see = a kind of fiction&quot;, even though it is the same single picture.

The setting of three main characters, who are not blood related, had the condition that they look like a family. It was not so much an exaggeration as a suggestion of a &quot;new image of the family in the future&quot;, but simply a suggestion that Kon&#x27;s idea of a family with this kind of relationship might be acceptable. Kon&#x27;s idea was to suggest that it is necessary to find a way for each person to have their own family, rather than a standardized model of what a new family should look like. Kon said that he did not intend to portray homeless people as representatives of weakness and unhappiness, or as a hindrance to society, and that the three are symbols of everyone&#x27;s weaknesses and regrets rather than real homeless people. He also said they are unhappy not because they are homeless, but because their lives have lost their former glow, and that happiness lies in the process of recovery, which is the story of this work itself.

==Release==
This movie was released in North America by Sony Pictures on December 29, 2003, in an unsuccessful attempt to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. The movie was released on sub-only DVD on April 13, 2004, and they planned to use DTS for the DVD, but was ultimately scrapped. Announced on December 19, 2019, international animation licensor, GKIDS, in partnership with the original US distributor Destination Films, released the movie on March 9, 2020, with a brand new 4K restoration and a new English dub.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Beautiful and substantive, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; adds a moving – and somewhat unconventional – entry to the animated Christmas canon.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;harrowing and heartwarming&quot;.

Susan Napier points out that &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; is part of a trend in anime and manga as depicting families in an increasingly dark fashion, showcasing the problems with traditional families, and attempts by people to construct a &quot;pseudo-family&quot; out of an increasingly fragmented and isolating modern Japanese society. Despite its seemingly traditional ending, the film offers a more radical version of family. Throughout the story these three homeless vagabonds unknowingly form a &quot;pseudo-family&quot; to protect themselves from the outside world and to overcome their personal demons.

==History==
===Ashok Motors===
Ashok Motors was founded in 1948 by Raghunandan Saran, an Indian independence campaigner from Punjab. By the end of the Indian Independence Movement, he was persuaded by India&#x27;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to invest in a modern industrial venture. Ashok Motors was incorporated in 1948 as a company to assemble and manufacture Austin cars from England, and the company was named after the founder&#x27;s only son, Ashok Saran.

In year 1954 Indian government gave approvals to Ashok Motors to manufacturer Leyland Comet trucks the generation range of cabover trucks from Leyland and they also received approvals to manufacture Tiger Cub lightweight bus also by Leyland. These were the first ever models of British Leyland manufactured in india.

The collaboration ended in 1975 but the holding of British Leyland, which was then a major British vehicle conglomerate due to several mergers, agreed to assist in technology, which continued until the 1980s. After 1975, changes in management structures saw the company launch various vehicles in the Indian market, with many of these models continuing to this day with various upgrades.

==Technology==
===Hythane engines===
Ashok Leyland has also developed hythane engines in association with the Australian company Eden Energy. Ashok Leyland developed a 6-cylinder, BS-4 engine which uses hythane (H-CNG,) which is a blend of natural gas and around 20% of hydrogen. A 4-cylinder engine is also being developed for H-CNG blend in a joint R&amp;D program with MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) and Indian Oil Corporation.
===Hybrid technology===
====Non-plugin Hybrid Bus====
At the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, Ashok Leyland introduced an advanced non-plugin version of HYBUS. HYBUS is powered by an H-Series 6-cylinder diesel (BS IV compliant) engine that is not used to drive the vehicle ahead, but to charge the ultra-capacitors that powers the 150 kW electric motor. Automatic start-stop is used to decrease the overall engine idling time. The bus can restart using the stored energy when the engine is off. The fuel-efficiency of the engine thus increases and NVH (Noise-vibration-harshness) levels decrease.

===Electric Technology===
In 2016 the company launched the country&#x27;s first indigenously produced fully electric bus, called Circuit. The bus is a zero-emission vehicle that can run 120 km on a single charge, and has an alert system that can signal if the bus is low on power. The bus will be introduced under the National Electric Mobility Plan with an aim of 20% penetration of electric or hybrid vehicles by 2020.

===Euro VI Truck===
AT the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, the company showcased its first indigenously produced Euro VI truck 4940. The truck is powered by the company&#x27;s flagship range of engine, Neptune, which is an 8l engine that produces 400 hp and 1600Nm of torque. The truck is designed to meet Euro VI norms.

===iEGR===
In 2017, the company showcased iEGR (intelligent exhaust gas recirculation) technology for its trucks and buses to meet BS-IV emission standards. The technology also promises other advantages like better fuel efficiency than BS-III trucks, and power transmission up to 400 HP.

===iBUS===
Ashok Leyland announced iBUS in the beginning of 2008, as part of the future for the country&#x27;s increasingly traffic-clogged major cities. Its Rs 6-million iBus is a feature-filled, low-floor concept bus for the metros revealed during the Auto Expo 2008 in India. This low-floored iBus will have the first of its kind features, including anti-lock braking system, electronic engine management and passenger infotainment. The executive class has an airline-like ambiance with wide LCD screens, reading lights, audio speakers and, for the first time, Internet on the move. A GPS system enables vehicle tracking and display of dynamic route information on LCD screens, which can also support infotainment packages including live data and news. The bus will probably be equipped with an engine from the new Neptune family, which Ashok Leyland also introduced at this exhibition, which is ready for the BS4/Euro 4 emission regulations and can be upgraded to Euro 5. Leyland&#x27;s iBus has hybrid technology.

It is among a group of roughly contemporaneous films that deal with moral panic over &quot;Broken Britain&quot; and &quot;hoodies&quot;. Some of the close up scenes were filmed at Frensham Small Pond.

==Plot==
Jenny Greengrass and her partner Steve Taylor set off for a weekend away at Eden Lake, a remote spot in the English countryside. On the journey there, Steve complains about the recent social behavior of youths and criticizes the parenting of adults.

The couple&#x27;s idyllic getaway is disrupted by a gang of rowdy teenagers, led by their psychopathic leader Brett. The next morning, Steve and Jenny discover their food supplies have been infested with insects, leading them to suspect the youths. At a local restaurant, Steve describes them to a waitress, who defensively insists her children would never harass anyone. Steve later sneaks into a house he believes belongs to the teens, but escapes upon the return of Jon, a surly homeowner.

Back at the lake, the couple discovers their jeep and belongings are missing. Returning to town on foot, they avoid a collision with Brett, having stolen the jeep. Finding Brett and the rest of the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve threatens them only for the gang to start pulling out knives; in the scuffle, Brett&#x27;s dog is stabbed, sending him into a rage. The couple tries to flee, but the gang causes them to crash the Jeep. With Steve trapped, Jenny flees as he is captured.

At daybreak, Jenny witnesses Steve being tied to a rock with barbed wire by the gang. Brett orders each of them to stab Steve so they will all be implicated. Paige, the only female gang member, records Steve&#x27;s torture on her phone. Jenny manages to distract the gang so Steve can free himself but she is unable to nurse his fatal wounds, forcing her to run for help.

Jenny runs into Adam, a young boy she and Steve previously met, who informs the gang of her location. They capture and tie Jenny, along with Steve&#x27;s dead body, to a pile of wood; Brett forces Adam to burn them while Paige films it. Jenny is able to escape, angering Brett who necklaces Adam in retaliation. Meanwhile, Jenny accidentally kills a younger reluctant youth, Cooper, who was actually attempting to help her. After finding Cooper&#x27;s body, Brett furiously beats another gang member to death. Paige flees in fear only for her to be run over by Jenny escaping in a van.

Jenny runs into the road, stopping a driver, only to realize he is Cooper&#x27;s older brother. She steals the car and is able to make it back to town, crashing into a backyard party. She later awakens and is comforted by a woman and Jon. The other parents are informed of the dead gang members, all of whom are the children of the adults at the house, making Jenny realize that she is in Brett&#x27;s home. With nowhere left to hide, Jenny locks herself in the bathroom for protection until Jon kicks the door down. Despite her pleas, Brett lies that she and Steve murdered his friends and his rottweiller, causing Jon and two other men to violently attack Jenny. Upon retreating to his room and blocking out the sound of Jenny&#x27;s screams, Brett deletes the videos of his gang&#x27;s crimes from Paige&#x27;s phone and stares blankly into a mirror while wearing Steve&#x27;s sunglasses.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, 78% of 32 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A brutal and effective British hoodie-horror that, despite the clichés, stays on the right side of scary.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews &quot;.

Dennis Harvey reviewed the film for &quot;Variety&quot; and said that it was &quot;an effectively harrowing Brit thriller-cum-horror pic,&quot; comparing it to &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw drew parallels with &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; and &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot;, and stated that &quot;this looks to me like the best British horror film in years: nasty, scary and tight as a drum,&quot; concluding that the film was &quot;exceptionally well made, ruthlessly extreme, relentlessly upsetting.&quot;

Other critics, however, have savaged the film, denouncing it as an incitement to class prejudice against working class people in Britain. &quot;The Sun&quot; condemned the film&#x27;s &quot;nasty suggestion that all working-class people are thugs&quot; while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; concluded that &quot;this ugly witless film expresses fear and loathing of ordinary English people&quot;. Owen Jones, in his book &quot;&quot; cites the film at length as an example of media demonisation of proletarian youth via the &quot;Chav&quot; stereotype. He comments, &quot;Here was a film arguing that the middle classes could no longer live alongside the quasi-bestial lower orders.&quot;

&quot;Eden Lake&quot; has been linked with other films that deal with concerns over &quot;Broken Britain&quot; and a fear of &quot;hoodies,&quot; including &quot;Harry Brown&quot;, &quot;The Disappeared&quot;, &quot;Summer Scars&quot;, &quot;Outlaw&quot;, &quot;The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael&quot;, &quot;Cherry Tree Lane&quot; and &quot;Heartless&quot;.

<text>Bjarmaland (also spelled &quot;Bjarmland&quot; and &quot;Bjarmia&quot;) was a territory mentioned in Norse sagas from the Viking Age and in geographical accounts until the 16th century. The term is usually understood to have referred to the southern shores of the White Sea and to the basin of the Northern Dvina River (&quot;Vienanjoki&quot; in Finnish) as well as, presumably, to some of the surrounding areas. Today, those territories comprise a part of the Arkhangelsk Oblast of Russia, as well as the Kola Peninsula.

== Norse voyagers in Bjarmaland ==
According to the &quot;Voyage of Ohthere&quot; (), the Norwegian merchant Ottar (Ohthere) reported to king Alfred the Great that he had sailed for 15 days along the northern coast and then southwards, finally arriving at a great river, probably the Northern Dvina. At the estuary of the river dwelt the &quot;Beormas&quot;, who unlike the nomadic Sami peoples were sedentary, and their land was rich and populous. Ohthere did not know their language but he said that it resembled the language of the Sami people. The Bjarmians told Ohthere about their country and other countries that bordered it.

Later, several expeditions were undertaken from Norway to Bjarmaland. In 920, Eric Bloodaxe made a Viking expedition, as well as Harald II of Norway and Haakon Magnusson of Norway, in 1090.

The best known expedition was that of Tore Hund, who, together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god &quot;Jómali&quot;. This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable chain around his neck. Tore and his men managed to escape from the pursuing Bjarmians with their rich bounty.

== Identification ==

The name Bjarmaland appears in Old Norse literature, possibly referring to the area where Arkhangelsk is presently situated, and where it was preceded by a Bjarmian settlement. The first appearance of the name occurs in an account of the travels of Ohthere of Hålogaland, which was written in about 890.

The name Permians is already found in the oldest document of the Rus&#x27;, the &quot;Nestor&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; (1000–1100). The names of other Uralic tribes are also listed including some Samoyedic peoples as well as the Veps, Cheremis, Mordvin, and Chudes.

The place-name Bjarmaland was also used later both by the German historian Adam of Bremen (11th century) and the Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) in &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauðs&quot;, reporting about its rivers flowing out to Gandvik. It is not clear if they reference the same Bjarmaland as was mentioned in the &quot;Voyage of Ohthere&quot;, however. The name of the Bjarmian god &quot;Jómali&quot; is so close to the word for &quot;god&quot; in most Finnic languages that Bjarmians were likely a Finnic group. In fact, languages belonging to other language groups have never been suggested within serious research.

The Swedish cartographer Olaus Magnus located Bjarmaland in the Kola Peninsula in his (1539), while Swedish humanist Johannes Schefferus (1621–1679) identified it with Lappland.

== Origin of the name: the Bjarmians ==
Bjarmians cannot be connected directly to any existing group of people living today, but it is likely that they were a separate group of Finnic speakers in the White Sea area. Toponyms and loan words in dialects in northern Russia indicate that Finnic speaking populations used to live in the area. Also Russian chronicles mention groups of people in the area associated with Finno-Ugric languages.

Accordingly, many historians assume the terms and to derive from the Uralic word &quot;perm&quot;, which refers to &quot;travelling merchants&quot; and represents the Old Permic culture. However, some linguists consider this theory to be speculative.

Recent research on the Uralic substrate in northern Russian dialects suggests that several other Uralic groups besides the Permians, lived in Bjarmaland, assumed to have included the &quot;Viena Karelians, Sami and Kvens&quot;. According to Helimski, the language spoken in the northern Archangel region, which he terms &quot;Lop&quot;&#x27;, was closely related to but distinct from the Sami languages proper. That would fit Ottar&#x27;s account perfectly.

Bjarmian trade reached southeast to Bolghar, by the Volga River, where the Bjarmians also interacted with Scandinavians and Fennoscandians, who had ventured southbound from the Baltic Sea area.

== Background ==
Modern historians suppose that the wealth of the Bjarmians was due to their profitable trade along the Northern Dvina, the Kama River and the Volga to Bolghar and other trading settlements in the south. Along this route, silver coins and other merchandise were exchanged for pelts and walrus tusks brought by the Bjarmians. In fact, burial sites in modern Perm Krai are the richest source of Sasanian and Sogdian silverware from Iran. Further north, the Bjarmians traded with the Sami.

It seems that the Scandinavians made some use of the Dvina trade route, in addition to the Volga trade route and Dnieper trade route. In 1217, two Norwegian traders arrived in Bjarmaland to buy pelts; one of the traders continued further south to pass to Russia in order to arrive in the Holy Land, where he intended to take part in the Crusades. The second trader who remained was killed by the Bjarmians. This caused Norwegian officials to undertake a campaign of retribution into Bjarmaland which they pillaged in 1222.

The 13th century seems to have seen the decline of the Bjarmians, who became tributaries of the Novgorod Republic. While many Slavs fled the Mongol invasion northward, to Beloozero and Bjarmaland, the displaced Bjarmians sought refuge in Norway, where they were given land around the Malangen fjord by Haakon IV of Norway in 1240. More important for the decline was probably that, with the onset of the Crusades, the trade routes had found a more westerly orientation or shifted considerably to the south.

When the Novgorodians founded Velikiy Ustiug, in the beginning of the 13th century, the Bjarmians had a serious competitor for the trade. More and more Pomors arrived in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries, which led to the final assimilation of the Bjarmians by the Slavs.

==Later use==
The collaborationist Quisling regime planned to build Norwegian colonies in Northern Russia, following a future success of Operation Barbarossa, and which were to be named &quot;Bjarmaland&quot;; but these plans never came to be.

<text>Devadatta was by tradition a Buddhist monk, cousin and brother-in-law of Gautama Siddhārtha. The accounts of his life vary greatly, but he is generally seen as an evil and divisive figure in Buddhism, who led a breakaway group in the earliest days of the religion.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Devadatta&quot; means &quot;god-given&quot; in Palī and Sanskrit. It is composed from the stem form of &quot;deva&quot; (&quot;god&quot;) and the past participle &quot;datta&quot; of the verb &quot;da&quot; (&quot;to give&quot;), composed as a tatpuruṣa compound. In the &quot;Bhagavad Gītā&quot;, the conch shell used by Arjuna on the battle-field of Kurukshetra was named &quot;Devadatta&quot;. The name Devadatta is still used today.

== Scholarship ==

=== Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya research ===
According to Andrew Skilton, modern scholarship generally agrees that the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya is the oldest extant Buddhist Vinaya.

According to Reginald Ray, the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya mentions the figure of Devadatta, but in a way that is different from the vinayas of the Sthaviravāda branch. According to this study, the earliest Vinaya material common to all sects simply depicts Devadatta as a Buddhist saint who wishes for the monks to live a rigorous lifestyle. This has led Ray to regard the story of Devadatta as a legend produced by the Sthavira group.

However, as Bhikkhu Sujato has noted, the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya does indeed contain material depicting Devadatta as a schismatic figure trying to split the sangha (monastic community). Sujato adds: &quot;The only relevant difference is the grounds he is said to base his attempt on. Whereas the Sthavira Vinayas say he promulgated a set of ‘five points’, by which he tried to enforce an excessively ascetic lifestyle on the monks, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya omits the five points and attributes a much more comprehensive agenda to him.&quot; Sujato further argues that &quot;The fact that the Devadatta legend, at least the core episodes 13 and 14, is common to all six Vinayas including the Mahāsaṅghika suggests the legend arose among the presectarian community, and in all likelihood harks back to the time of the Buddha himself.&quot;

=== Records from Chinese pilgrims to India ===
Faxian and other Chinese pilgrims who travelled to India in the early centuries of the current era recorded the continued existence of &quot;Gotamaka&quot; buddhists, followers of Devadatta. Gotamaka are also referred to in Pali texts of the second and fifth centuries of the current era. The followers of Devadatta are recorded to have honored all the Buddhas previous to Śākyamuni (Gautama Buddha), but not Śākyamuni himself. According to Faxian, Xuanzang and Yijing&#x27;s writings, some people practised in a similar way and with the same books as common Buddhists, but followed the similar tapas and performed rituals to the past three buddhas and not Śākyamuni.

== Theravāda portrayals of Devadatta ==

=== In the Theravāda Vinaya ===

Cullavagga section VII of the &quot;Vinayapiṭaka&quot; of the Theravādins, which deals with schisms, recalls an account of how Devadatta went forth along with a number of the Buddha&#x27;s other relatives and clansmen. In the first year he attained psychic power (&quot;abhijñā&quot;), but made no supramundane achievement.

Seeking honor and status, Devadatta approached Prince Ajātashatru, the heir to the throne of Magadha. Having psychic power, he assumed the form of a young boy clad in snakes and sat in the prince&#x27;s lap; this much impressed Ajātashatru, who became his disciple.

Ajātashatru began to send great offerings to Devadatta, and the latter became obsessed with his own worth. He began to believe that he should lead the Sangha instead of the Buddha; his attempts to usurp the Buddha decreased his psychic power, but Devadatta continued.

When told about the offerings that Devadatta was receiving, the Buddha remarked that all these gains were only going towards his destruction, just as a plantain or a bamboo is destroyed by its fruit.

Shortly thereafter, Devadatta asked the Buddha to retire and let him take over the running of the Sangha. The Buddha retorted that he did not even let his trusted disciples Śāriputra or Maudgalyayana run the Sangha, let alone someone like Devadatta. The Buddha declared that Devadatta should be cast out like spit, and the Buddha warned the Sangha that Devadatta had changed for the worse.

Seeing the danger in this, Devadatta approached Prince Ajātashatru and encouraged him to kill his father King Bimbisāra, while Devadatta killed the Buddha. The king found out about his plan and handed over control of the kingdom to his son and heir.

Ajātashatru then gave mercenaries to Devadatta, who ordered them to kill the Buddha; in an elaborate plan to cover his tracks, he ordered other men to kill the killers, and more to kill them and so on. When the mercenaries approached the Buddha, they were unable to carry out their orders, and were rallied to his side instead.

Devadatta then tried to kill the Buddha himself by throwing a rock at him from a great height while the Buddha walked on the slopes of a mountain. This failed, and as a consequence he decided to have the elephant Nāḷāgiri intoxicated and let him loose on the Buddha while he was on alms-round. However, the power of the Buddha&#x27;s love and kindness overcame the elephant, and he did not harm the Buddha.

Devadatta then decided to foment schism in the Buddhist community. He gathered some allies among the monks, and demanded that the Buddha accede to the following rules for the monks: they should dwell all their lives in the forest, live entirely on alms obtained by begging, wear only robes made of discarded rags, dwell at the foot of a tree, and abstain completely from fish and flesh.

The Buddha refused to make any of these compulsory. Devadatta declared that the Buddha was living in abundance in luxury, and caused a schism by reading out the initiation rites and codes (pāṭimokkha) to five hundred initiates, away from the Buddha and his followers.

The Buddha sent his two most trusted disciples, Śāriputra or Maudgalyayana, to bring back the errant young monks. Devadatta thought they had come to join his Sangha, and invited Śāriputra to a discussion; the former then fell asleep. The Buddha&#x27;s disciples then persuaded the young monks to return to the Buddha.
The Buddha did not show any hatred for Devadatta, even after what had happened. Soon after, Devadatta got sick and realized that what he had done was wrong. He tried to visit the Buddha and apologize for what he did, but it was too late; on the way to the Buddha, the earth sucked Devadatta into Naraka (translated as purgatory or Hell) for his evil deeds. Beings are sent to Naraka as an inherent consequence of bad karma, and they stay there until bad karma is compensated for. 

===Pali Canon===
According to the Pāli Canon, he taught his sangha to adopt five tapas (literally, &quot;austerities&quot;) throughout their lives:

#that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest,
#that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging,
#that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity,
#that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof,
#that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh.

The Buddha&#x27;s reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules – except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season – but he refused to make the rules obligatory. They are among the 13 ascetic practices (dhutanga).

His followers (including bhikkhus and bhikkhunis) were new monks from the Vajjī clan.

King Kalābu was one of Devadatta&#x27;s past lives.

=== &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; ===
In the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;, a series of previous lives of Gautama Buddha and Devadatta are told by Nagasena to King Menander I. When asked by Menander why Devadatta sometimes prevails in their successive incarnations, Nagasena explains Devadatta is not always evil, and in fact has accrued much merit in some of his lives. Even after being ordained, he lives with virtue for a long time until developing an ambition to overcome the Buddha.

== Mahāyāna portrayals of Devadatta ==
===&quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;===
In the Lotus Sūtra, chapter 12, found in the Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition, the Buddha teaches that in a past life, Devadatta was his holy teacher who set him on the path, and makes a noteworthy statement about how even Devadatta will in time become a Buddha:

The Lotus Sutra may be interpreted as relaying the idea that Devadatta is not saved by the Buddha himself, but by his own merit, leading to his awakening.

According to Jacqueline Stone and Stephen F. Teiser, Devadatta was &quot;well known to the sutra&#x27;s early devotees as the Buddhist archetype of an evildoer.&quot; In the context of the &quot;promise of buddhahood for everyone, this chapter became widely understood as illustrating the potential for enlightenment even in evil persons.&quot;

===&quot;Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra&quot;===
In the Mahayana Buddhist text, the &quot;Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra&quot;, Devadatta is said to have convinced Prince Ajātasattu to murder his father King Bimbisāra and ascend the throne. Ajātasattu follows the advice, and this action (another &quot;anantarika-kamma&quot; for killing one&#x27;s own father) prevents him from attaining stream-entry at a later time, when listening to some teaching of the Buddha. This is confirmed by the Samaññaphala Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya (DN 2).

=== Others ===
In the &quot;Mahāmeghasūtra&quot; Devadatta is called a mahāpuruṣa (great being).

In Faxian&#x27;s account, after meeting failure his attempts to murder Gautama Buddha through arrows, a rock and an elephant, Devadatta pretends to prostrate to his feet and claws at him with poisoned fingernails, but the Buddha turns his legs into rock crystal, causing Devadatta to break his nails and get poisoned himself. Gautama offers Devadatta forgiveness in exchange for Devadatta&#x27;s faith, warning that whoever professes his faith falsely will go to hell. Being in great pain, Devadatta does this and is immediately swallowed by hell.

<doc id="981898" wikidata="Q334120" url="?curid=981898" title="Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild">
<text>Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, (8 November 1840 – 31 March 1915) was a British banker and politician from the wealthy international Rothschild family. He was also a hereditary Baron of the Austrian Empire.

==Early life==

Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild was the eldest son of Baron Lionel de Rothschild (1808–1879) and Baroness Charlotte von Rothschild (née von Rothschild). His paternal grandparents were Nathan Mayer Rothschild, after whom he was named, and Hannah Barent-Cohen, daughter of Levy Barent Cohen. His maternal grandparents were Carl Mayer von Rothschild (1788–1855) and Adelheid Herz (1800–1853). Through both of his grandfathers, who were brothers, he was the great-grandson of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), founder of the dynasty.

In his youth, Rothschild was a Captain in the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a friend of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), but left without taking a degree.

==Career==
Rothschild worked as a partner in the London branch of the family bank, N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, and became head of the bank after his father&#x27;s death in 1879. During his tenure, he also maintained its pre-eminent position in private venture finance and in issuing loans to the governments of the US, Russia and Austria. Following the Rothschilds&#x27; funding of the Suez Canal, a close relationship was maintained with Benjamin Disraeli and affairs in Egypt.

Rothschild also funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company and the De Beers diamond conglomerate. He later administered Rhodes&#x27; estate after Rhodes&#x27; death in 1902 and helped to set up the Rhodes Scholarship scheme at the University of Oxford. He was a prominent member of the Round Table movement, created in 1909.

A noted philanthropist, Rothschild was heavily involved with the foundation of the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, a model dwellings company whose aim was to provide decent housing, predominantly for the Jews of Spitalfields and Whitechapel. He also served as a trustee of the London Mosque Fund until his death. From 1889 until his death, he was Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire and was well known as an agriculturist.

In the 1902 Coronation Honours list, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor and was sworn a member of the council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902. On the same day, he was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Grand Cross (GCVO).

===House of Commons===
From 1865 to 1885, Nathan Rothschild sat in the House of Commons as Liberal Member of Parliament for Aylesbury. His father Lionel had previously been elected for the City of London from 1847 but had been unable to take the obligatory oath until 1858; they were MPs together from 1865 to 1868 and from 1869 to 1874.

===Baron Rothschild===
In 1847, his uncle Anthony Nathan de Rothschild (1810–1876) was made a baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Since Sir Anthony had no male heirs, upon his death, the baronetcy passed by special remainder to his nephew Nathan.

In 1885, Rothschild became a member of the House of Lords when he was created Baron Rothschild, of Tring in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was also a hereditary &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron) of the Austrian Empire, a noble title that he had inherited via his father. In 1838, Queen Victoria had authorized the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom.

When he was raised to the peerage by Gladstone, Rothschild was the first Jewish member of the House of Lords not to have previously converted to Christianity. (Disraeli had been created Earl of Beaconsfield in 1876, but he was baptised into Anglicanism at age twelve.)

In common with the rest of his family, Rothschild joined the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party, formed in 1886 by Joseph Chamberlain, which ultimately merged into the Conservative Party.

In 1909, he was famously derided by David Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, over his opposition to the People&#x27;s Budget, when the latter said, at a meeting at the Holborn Restaurant on 24June that year: &quot;I really think we are having too much Lord Rothschild. Are we to have all ways of reform, financial and social, blocked, simply by a notice-board; &#x27;No Thoroughfare. By Order of Nathaniel Rothschild&#x27;?&quot; Rothschild recommended the Lords reject the Parliament Bill, which was, however, passed.

In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Rothschild was consulted for economic advice by Lloyd George. At his first invitation to confer at the Treasury, when asked what could be done to raise more money for the war effort, Rothschild reportedly answered: &quot;Tax the rich, and tax them heavily.&quot;

==Personal life==
On 16 April 1867, he married Emma Louise von Rothschild (1844–1935), a double first cousin (i.e., they shared both sets of grandparents) from the Rothschild banking family of Germany in Frankfurt. They had three children:

* Lionel Walter Rothschild (1868–1937), who never married but had two mistresses, one of whom bore him a daughter.
* Charlotte Louisa Adela &quot;Evelina&quot; Rothschild (1873–1947), who married Clive Behrens, son of Edward Behrens of Bettisfield Park, Whitchurch, in 1899.
* Nathaniel Charles Rothschild (1877–1923), who married Rózsika Edle von Wertheimstein (1870–1940)

He died in London, five days after an operation, on 31 March 1915 and was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery. Following his death, the peerage was inherited by his son, Lionel Walter Rothschild.

<text>As part of consumer behavior, the buying decision process is the decision-making process used by consumers regarding the market transactions before, during, and after the purchase of a good or service. It can be seen as a particular form of a cost–benefit analysis in the presence of multiple alternatives.

Common examples include shopping and deciding what to eat. Decision-making is a psychological construct. This means that although a decision cannot be &quot;seen&quot;, we can infer from observable behavior that a decision has been made. Therefore, we conclude that a psychological &quot;decision-making&quot; event has occurred. It is a construction that imputes a commitment to action. That is, based on observable actions, we assume that people have made a commitment to effect the action.

Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon sees economic decision-making as a vain attempt to be rational. Simon claimed (in 1947 and 1957) that if a complete analysis is to be done, a decision will be immensely complex. Simon also wrote that peoples&#x27; information processing ability is limited. The assumption of a perfectly rational economic actor is unrealistic. Consumers are influenced by emotional and nonrational considerations making attempts to be rational only partially successful. He called for replacing the perfect rationality assumptions of homo economicus with a conception of rationality tailored to cognitively limited agents. Even if the buyer decision process was highly rational, the required product information and/or knowledge is often substantially limited in quality or extent, as is the availability of potential alternatives. Factors such as cognitive effort and decision-making time also play a role.

==Stages==

The five stages of a decision process were first introduced by philosopher John Dewey in &quot;How We Think&quot; in 1910. Later studies expanded upon Dewey&#x27;s initial work and are seen as foundational for analysis of consumer purchasing decision-making. Dewey did not refer in &quot;How We Think&quot; specifically to &quot;purchasing&quot; decisions, but in applied terms his five stages are:
*Problem/Need Recognition – recognize what the problem or need is and identify the product or type of product which is required.
*Information Search – the consumer researches the product which would satisfy the recognized need.
*Evaluation of Alternatives – the consumer evaluates the searched alternatives. Generally, the information search reveals multiple products for the consumer to evaluate and understand which product would be appropriate.
*Purchase Decision – after the consumer has evaluated all the options and would be having the intention to buy any product, there could be now only two things which might just change the decision of the consumer of buying the product that is what the other peers of the consumer think of the product and any unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances for example, in this case, could be financial losses which led to not buying of the product.
*Post Purchase Behavior – after the purchase, the consumer may experience post-purchase dissonance feeling that buying another product would have been better. Addressing post-purchase dissonance spreads the good word for the product and increases the chance of frequent repurchase.

These five stages are a framework to evaluate customers&#x27; buying decision process. While many consumers pass through these stages in a fixed, linear sequence, some stages such as evaluation of alternatives may occur throughout the purchase decision. The time and effort devoted to each stage depend on a number of factors including the perceived risk and the consumer&#x27;s motivations. In the case of an impulse purchase, such as the purchase of a chocolate bar as a personal treat, the consumer may spend minimal time engaged in information search and evaluation and proceed directly to the actual purchase.

===Problem/need-recognition===
Problem/Need-recognition is the first step in the buying decision. Without knowing what the customer needs, they will not be enticed to purchase the product. The need can be triggered by internal stimuli (e.g. hunger, thirst) or external stimuli (e.g. advertising).  Maslow held that needs are arranged in a hierarchy. According to Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy, only when a person has fulfilled the needs at a certain stage, can he or she move to the next stage.
The problem must be the products or services available. It&#x27;s how the problem must be recognized.

===Information search===

The information search stage is the next step that the customers may take after they have recognized the problem or need in order to find out what they feel is the best solution. The field of information has come a long way in the last forty years, and has enabled easier and faster information discovery. Consumers can rely on print, visual, and/or voice media for getting information.

===Evaluation of alternatives===
At this stage, consumers evaluate different products/brands on the basis of varying product attributes, and whether these can deliver the benefits that the customers are seeking.  This stage is heavily influenced by one&#x27;s attitude, as &quot;attitude puts one in a frame of mind: liking or disliking an object, moving towards or away from it&quot;.  Another factor that influences the evaluation process is the degree of involvement. For example, if the customer involvement is high, then he/she will evaluate a number of brands; whereas if it is low, only one brand will be evaluated.

===Purchase decision===
This is the fourth stage, where the purchase takes place. According to Kotler, Keller, Koshy, and Jha (2009), the final purchase decision can be disrupted by two factors: negative feedback from other customers and the level of motivation to comply or accept the feedback. For example, after going through the above three stages, a customer chooses to buy a Nikon D80 DSLR camera. However, because his good friend, who is also a photographer, gives him negative feedback, he will then be bound to change his preference. Secondly, the decision may be disrupted due to unanticipated situations such as a sudden job loss or the closing of a retail store.

===Post-purchase behavior===
These stages are important to keeping customers. Customers match products with their experiences on whether they are either content or discontent with the product. This affects the decision process for resemblant purchases from the same company in the future, mainly at the information search stage and evaluation of alternatives stage. If brand loyalty is made then customers will often fast-tracked or skip completely the information search and evaluation of alternative stages.

Either being content or discontent, a customer will spread good or bad opinions about the product. At this stage, companies try to make favorable post-purchase communication to encourage the customers to purchase. 

Also, cognitive dissonance (consumer confusion in marketing terms) is common at this stage; customers often go through the feelings of post-purchase psychological tension or anxiety. Questions include: &quot;Have I made the right decision?&quot;, &quot;Is it a good choice?&quot;, etc.

==Models of buyer decision-making==
There are generally three ways of analyzing consumer buying decisions:
* Economic models – largely quantitative and are based on the assumptions of rationality and near perfect knowledge. The consumer is seen to maximize its utility. See consumer theory. Game theory can also be used in some circumstances.
* Psychological models – psychological and cognitive processes such as motivation and need recognition. They are qualitative rather than quantitative and build on sociological factors like cultural influences and family influences.
* Consumer behavior models – practical models used by marketers. They typically blend both economic and psychological models.

In an early study of the buyer decision process literature, Frank Nicosia (Nicosia, F. 1966; pp. 9–21) identified three types of buyer decision-making models. They are the univariate model (He called it the &quot;simple scheme&quot;.) in which only one behavioral determinant was allowed in a stimulus-response type of relationship; the multi-variate model (He called it a &quot;reduced form scheme&quot;.) in which numerous independent variables were assumed to determine buyer behavior; and finally the &quot;system of equations&quot; model (He called it a &quot;structural scheme&quot; or &quot;process scheme&quot;.) in which numerous functional relations (either univariate or multivariate) interact in a complex system of equations. He concluded that only this third type of model is capable of expressing the complexity of buyer decision processes. In chapter 7, Nicosia builds a comprehensive model involving five modules. The encoding module includes determinants like &quot;attributes of the brand&quot;, &quot;environmental factors&quot;, &quot;consumer&#x27;s attributes&quot;, &quot;attributes of the organization&quot;, and &quot;attributes of the message&quot;. Other modules in the system include consumer decoding, search and evaluation, decision, and consumption.

Some neuromarketing research papers examined how to approach motivation as indexed by electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry over the prefrontal cortex predicts purchase decision when brand and price are varied. In a within-subjects design, the participants have presented purchase decision trials with 14 different grocery products (seven private labels and seven national brand products) whose prices were increased and decreased while their EEG activity was recorded. The results showed that relatively greater left frontal activation (i.e., higher approach motivation) during the decision period predicted an affirmative purchase decision. The relationship of frontal EEG asymmetry with purchase decision was stronger for national brand products compared with private label products and when the price of a product was below a normal price (i.e., implicit reference price) compared with when it was above a normal price. The higher perceived need for a product and higher perceived product quality were associated with greater relative left frontal activation.

For any high-involvement product category, the decision-making time is normally long and buyers generally evaluate the information available very cautiously. They also utilize an active information search process. The risk associated with such a decision is very high.

==Neuroscience==
Neuroscience is a useful tool and a source of theory development and testing in buyer decision-making research. Neuroimaging devices are used in Neuromarketing to investigate consumer behavior.

Cocco went to many ballet auditions, hoping to become a professional ballerina. She went to singing auditions to earn the traveling expenses for a ballet audition in Tokyo. She did not pass it, but after impressing the judges, she was later signed by Victor Entertainment.

== Career ==
Cocco made her debut on an indie label under the name &quot;Cocko&quot; with a self-titled EP &quot;Cocko&quot; on November 21, 1996. A track from the EP, &quot;Sing a Song ~No Music, No Life~&quot;, was used in an advertising campaign for Tower Records Japan.

On March 21, 1997, Cocco changed the official spelling of her name to &quot;Cocco&quot; and released her major label debut single &quot;Countdown&quot;. A full-length album followed shortly after. It was not until 1998 when she scored a big hit in Japan with &quot;Tsuyoku Hakanaimonotachi&quot;, which sold more than 250,000.

Cocco went on to record three more albums – &quot;Kumuiuta&quot; in 1998, &quot;Rapunzel&quot; in 2000, and &quot;Sangurōzu&quot; in 2001. Before the release of &quot;Sangurōzu&quot;, Cocco announced she was retiring from the music business. Later that year, her label released a career retrospective, &quot;Best + Ura Best + Mihappyōkyokushū&quot;, which contained her singles, some b-sides and five unreleased tracks.

Her retirement did not last long. In 2002, she published her first art book, &quot;Minami no Shima no Hoshi no Suna&quot;. In August 2003, she organized a benefit concert to raise awareness about cleaning up beaches in Okinawa. A DVD documentary entitled &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Hell&quot; followed in December.

2004 saw her appearance on the Yutaka Ozaki cover album &quot;BLUE&quot; and the publication of her second book, &quot;Minami no Shima no Koi no Uta&quot;, which was accompanied by a limited edition single, &quot;Garnet/Celeste Blue&quot;. In 2005, Cocco collaborated with photographer/singer Nanaco on a CD/book combination titled &quot;The Bird&quot;.

In late 2004, Cocco teamed up with Shigeru Kishida of the Japanese rock group Quruli to re-record &quot;Sing a Song&quot; for Tower Records&#x27; 25th Anniversary in Japan. The sessions inspired the formation of Singer Songer, a band featuring Cocco, Kishida, Quruli bassist Masashi Sato, Cornelius support keyboardist Hirohisa Horie and former FEED drummer Dai Taro.

Singer Songer made its live debut as special guests at Quruli&#x27;s year-end concert in December 2004, and in May 2005, the band released a single, &quot;Shoka Rinrin&quot;. An album, &quot;Barairo Pop&quot; was released in June 2005. It contains a selection of country-flavored tracks that are much happier than Cocco&#x27;s previous works.

In April 2006, she wrote a series of essays for Mainichi Shimbun. Since then, Cocco has continued to write for various newspapers and magazines.

On July 7, 2007, Cocco performed at the Japanese leg of Live Earth at the Makuhari Messe, Chiba. After releasing the album &quot;Kira Kira&quot;, she started living in the UK and went to college to learn photography.

In 2010, Cocco published her first long novel &quot;Polomerria&quot;. She appeared at the World Happiness 2010 rock festival in Tokyo on August 8. She released &quot;Emerald&quot;, her first self-produced album, on August 11. Cocco provided 14-year-old Director Ryugo Nakamura&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Yagi no Boken&quot; with the theme song &quot;Yagi no Sanpo&quot;. She got a letter from the youngest film director in Japanese film history, and she decided to help the boy.

In 2011, the no-budget indie film &quot;Inspired movies&quot; produced by Cocco and her fellow video artists was released.

In 2011, Cocco made her acting debut, starring in &quot;KOTOKO&quot;, directed by Shinya Tsukamoto. She was also responsible for the art direction and music.

She covered &quot;Good Bye&quot; for the June 6, 2018 hide tribute album &quot;Tribute Impulse&quot;.

<doc id="981908" wikidata="Q7789727" url="?curid=981908" title="Thomas Forsaith">
<text>Thomas Spencer Forsaith, JP (18 July 1814 – 29 November 1898), was a New Zealand politician and an Auckland draper. According to some historians, he was the country&#x27;s second premier, although a more conventional view states that neither he nor his predecessor (James FitzGerald) should properly be given that title.

==Early life==
Forsaith was born in London, England on 18 July 1814 to Samuel Forsaith (1776–1832) and Elizabeth Forsaith née Emberson (1782–1844). His father was a linen draper and haberdasher. His parents belonged to the Congregational church.

His father&#x27;s first marriage was to Elizabeth Smyth (1771 – 23 September 1809). They had five children:
* Sarah Smyth Forsaith (4 August 1801 – 26 April 1854)
* Samuel Smyth Forsaith (21 January 1803 – 1 April 1894)
* John Smyth Forsaith (8 October 1804 – 31 July 1883)
* Elizabeth Smyth Forsaith (21 May 1806 – 12 August 1809)
* Mary Smyth Forsaith (19 February 1808 – 3 June 1845)

Of those, Samuel emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland prior to May 1851. He died in Thames in 1894.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in September 1809, Samuel Forsaith married Elizabeth née Emberson on 4 October 1810. They had nine children:
* Elizabeth Forsaith (10 July 1811 – 2 July 1841)
* Thomas Forsaith (7 December 1812 – 16 February 1813)
* Thomas Spencer Forsaith (18 July 1814 – 29 November 1898)
* Hannah Forsaith (1 March 1816 – 2 May 1819)
* Phebe Forsaith (6 July 1817 – 6 February 1819)
* David Forsaith (21 June 1819 – 5 September 1819)
* Robert Forsaith (11 July 1820 – 23 May 1883)
* Josiah Forsaith (29 April 1822 – 8 May 1883)
* Hephzibah Forsaith (24 July 1824 – 21 December 1897)
Apart from Thomas Spencer Forsaith, his sister Hephzibah also emigrated to New Zealand; in 1847 on the&quot;Elora&quot;. All other siblings and his parents remained in England.

Thomas Forsaith became an apprentice as a silk merchant in Croydon, but he rather wanted to go to sea. As a cabin boy, he travelled on a collier to the River Tyne. He then made three journeys to the West Indies as a cadet officer for Charles Horsfall and Co. on the &quot;Huddersfield&quot; (named after Horsfall&#x27;s birthplace). He returned home with a good reference, but found that his father had died in the meantime. As a fourth officer, he sailed on the convict ship &quot;Hoogley&quot; to Botany Bay in 1834. Two years later, he again sailed to Australia, this time on the &quot;Lord Goderich&quot;. He first came to New Zealand on the return journey, when Kauri spars were loaded in Hokianga.

Forsaith was married on 17 May 1838 at the Congregational Church in Old Broad Street, London to Elizabeth Mary, a daughter of Robert Clements of Hoxton. Their wedding was one of the first in a dissenting church that was legalised. They decided to emigrate to New Zealand and Forsaith took woodworking machinery and trading goods with them on the &quot;Coromandel&quot; later in 1838.

===Early life in New Zealand===
Forsaith established himself as a farmer and trader in the Kaipara District. He bought land in 1839 on the Wairoa River near present-day Dargaville. He was likely to have been the first European settler in the area. He built a timber mill for cutting Kauri spars, as the British Government was purchasing these at £17 each. He cleared land for wheat and running cattle, which he had to import. By May 1841, he had fenced 12 acres of cleared land, most of it growing wheat.

While the Forsaiths were visiting Sydney in February 1842, the discovery of a Māori skull on their property caused serious trouble, as Māori chiefs including Te Tirarau Kukupa claimed a tapu and ransacked the station as utu. An upset Forsaith asked the Governor (William Hobson) for compensation, who sent the Protector of Aborigines, George Clarke, to investigate. Forsaith was cleared of any wrongdoing, and the Māori chiefs settled by giving him a block of land of . Forsaith, still unsettled by the incident, swapped his land holding with another nearer Auckland. Clarke, who had held his role since April 1840, had not visited the Kaipa District before and made recommendations for a magistracy there.

On 30 October 1843, Charlotte Clements Forsaith was born in Auckland; she was their only child. She was baptised on 5 December that year. She married Thomas Morell MacDonald at her father&#x27;s residence in Khyber Pass Road, Auckland, on 7 January 1862. Their grandson Tom Macdonald (1898–1980) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for over 20 years. Charlotte died on 12 December 1894 in Invercargill.

===Protectorate Department===
Hobson, impressed by Forsaith&#x27;s command of the Māori language and his knowledge of their customs, offered him the role of Sub-protector of Aborigines, which he accepted. Forsaith was thus reporting to Clarke. They were working in the Protectorate Department created by Hobson, following instructions from the British secretary of state for the colonies. The department&#x27;s role was &quot;to watch over the interests of the Aborigines as their protector&quot; and had religious, social and intellectual aspects. It was also given a second role, which conflicted with the first; since the Treaty of Waitangi, the Crown was the sole purchaser of Māori land, and the department&#x27;s role was to action the purchases. Clarke managed to persuade Hobson to free him of the land purchase role, but it remained within the scope of the Sub-protectors.

In 1843, Forsaith was promoted to Protector in succession of Clarke. Forsaith worked closely with the second Governor, Robert FitzRoy. They travelled in the Cook Strait area in 1844, and to the Māori meeting at Waikanae following the Wairau Affray near Tuamarina, the first serious clash of arms between Māori and colonists. Forsaith was then stationed in Wellington and witnessed the Te Aro land purchase in February 1844. He negotiated with Te Rangihaeata about the evacuation of land in the Hutt Valley, but the actions of the New Zealand Company and the impatience of the settlers to move onto disputed land resulted in the Hutt Valley campaign. He acted as interpreter for Mathew Richmond, the Government Superintendent for the Southern District, and Bishop Selwyn, the first Anglican Bishop of New Zealand. When the influential chief Te Rauparaha visited Wellington in 1845, he was shown around by Forsaith.

In 1846, the department was abolished by the next Governor, George Grey, as he wanted to have influence over Māori issues himself. Grey appointed a Native Secretary instead. Forsaith left Government employment in the following year.

===Business interests===
Forsaith opened a drapery store in Auckland&#x27;s Queen Street. He had this business from 1847 to 1862. He also edited the &quot;Daily Southern Cross&quot; newspaper for a while. He became a Justice of the peace in 1857.

==Political career==
===New Ulster Council===
The Proclamation of 1852 stipulated that the New Ulster Legislative Council, which had been in place since 1848, was to have twelve elected and six nominated members. Forsaith was asked by a group of electors to become a candidate. Elections in the Northern Division District were held on 31 August 1852, and Allan O&#x27;Neill (from Bayswater) and Forsaith were returned. The council had not met by the time the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 arrived, which resulted in the abolition of New Ulster and New Munster provinces and their replacement with new provincial governments and established, a bicameral New Zealand Parliament, consisting of the General Assembly, the Governor, and a legislative council.

===Parliament===

Forsaith once again stood for election and he and Walter Lee were returned on 23 August 1853 to the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representatives of the Northern Division electorate, which covered the area north of Auckland but south of Whangārei.

The Fitzgerald Executive was the first Executive Council under the 1852 Constitution led by James FitzGerald. When it became clear that the first ministers had no power, they resigned as the Executive after seven weeks on 2 August 1854. Robert Wynyard, the administrator filling in after Grey&#x27;s departure and before the arrival of the next Governor, Colonel Thomas Gore Browne prorogued Parliament as the members refused to accept his claim that responsible government was not possible without royal assent, which had not been given. In the second session of the 1st Parliament, Forsaith, as a member of the minority which supported Wynyard, was appointed by Wynyard to lead an Executive. The other members of this Executive were Jerningham Wakefield, William Travers and James Macandrew. This appointed Cabinet did not have the confidence of Parliament and lasted only from 31 August to 2 September 1854. Forsaith&#x27;s Ministry is the shortest in New Zealand&#x27;s parliamentary history.

When Browne arrived, he announced that self-government would begin with the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. No new Cabinet was formed before then, but when it did, responsible government was obtained under the Sewell Ministry led by Henry Sewell.

In the 1855 general election, Northern Division was contested by four candidates. The two incumbents, Forsaith and Lee, stood against Thomas Henderson and Joseph May (who would later become a prominent member of the Auckland Provincial Council). They received 292, 294, 363 and 213 votes, respectively. Henderson and Lee were thus declared elected, and Forsaith was beaten by two votes.

Forsaith and Reader Wood contested a vacancy in the City of Auckland electorate. The nomination meeting on 26 April 1858 sparked little interest. A show of hands was in favour of Forsaith, and Wood called for a poll. The election was held the next day and Forsaith was elected. Parliament at the time was in session, and he took the oath on 28 April, being welcomed back by the speaker.

Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, the paramount chief of Te Āti Awa, refused to sell land to the government. When Te Teira, one of the minor chiefs of the tribe, agreed to sell land, many missionaries and a previous Chief Justice, William Martin, warned that the purchase was illegal. The events resulted in the First Taranaki War. Forsaith supported
Kingi in Parliament and made himself deeply unpopular, which effectively ended his political career. He retired at the end of the 2nd Parliament.

Forsaith was a deeply religious person, and he gave religious lectures to the public while he was a member of parliament. During his time in the 1st Parliament, he tried to secure religious toleration. He successfully defeated Hugh Carleton&#x27;s motion of having Bishop Selwyn&#x27;s salary paid by the Government, thus preventing the Anglican Church from becoming the one religion endorsed by the state.

==Services to the church==

In 1862, Forsaith entered the services of the church. Since 1850, he had belonged to the Presbyterian Church. In early 1865, he was considered to become a minister at the gold fields in Tuapeka, but the Presbytery in Dunedin voted against licensing him, as he hadn&#x27;t completed his studies yet. The view was held that a &quot;minister of the Gospel should be able to read at least the New Testament in the original [Greek] text&quot;. Instead, Forsaith was offered a missionary post to the gold fields, which he declined. In July of that year, he was instead ordained as a pastor at the new Congregational Church at Port Chalmers.
In 1867, Forsaith accepted an invitation for a pastorate at Woollahra. His health had suffered over the winter, and apparently he hoped for an improvement in the warmer climate. He left New Zealand on board the &quot;Parisian&quot; on 23 September 1867. In 1868, he moved to Parramatta, where he initially held services in the School of Arts. A church was built for the community, which opened on 19 May 1872. Also in 1872, Forsaith became chairman of the Congregational Union of New South Wales. In 1874, he acquired &quot;Morton House&quot; in Melville St, Parramatta, the house of the solicitor John Morton Gould, father of Albert Gould. &quot;Morton House&quot; remained the principal family residence for the rest of his life.

In 1878, he became resident chaplain at Camden College, a theological college founded in 1864. From there, he initiated a branch mission at Haslam&#x27;s Creek, but moved back to Parramatta in 1882.

Subsequent to this, a period of travel started. He went to New Zealand (he left Melbourne for New Zealand in March 1882 on the &quot;Rotomahana&quot;), America, Canada and Europe, including lecture series in Britain (which attracted many new immigrants to New Zealand) and officiating at the Presbyterian Church in Venice. He returned to Melbourne from Britain in April 1884 on the &quot;Berengaria&quot;. He then relieved at churches in Australia, Dunedin and Invercargill.

==Death and commemoration==
He began his memoirs in early 1898 and wrote a will on 13 June 1898. The will requests that busts of him and his wife be installed at the Congregational Church in Parramatta, but this has never happened. The first twelve chapters of his auto-biography have been lost, but the remaining chapters are held at the National Library in Canberra. Forsaith died on 29 November 1898 in Parramatta. He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery, sharing a grave with his wife, who died on 29 January 1900. Their daughter had died before them in 1894, and her husband Thomas Morell MacDonald was one of the executors of Thomas Forsaith&#x27;s will.

He was described as &quot;calmly spending the evening of life in the midst of the orange groves at Parramatta, a venerable, vigorous, and versatile octogenarian colonist.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Russians are coming&quot; is a phrase attributed to United States Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in 1949. In full, Forrestal said &quot;The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They&#x27;re right around. I&#x27;ve seen Russian soldiers.&quot;

Forrestal allegedly uttered those words while suffering from mental illness, not long before committing suicide. The allegation originated with Forrestal&#x27;s bitter political enemy, columnist Drew Pearson, and has been verified by no other person. This is what Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley have to say about the episode in their 1992 book, &quot;Driven Patriot, the Life and Times of James Forrestal&quot;:


Since then the phrase has been used in various contexts.

<doc id="981915" wikidata="Q7524253" url="?curid=981915" title="Singular point of an algebraic variety">
<text>In the mathematical field of algebraic geometry, a singular point of an algebraic variety is a point that is &#x27;special&#x27; (so, singular), in the geometric sense that at this point the tangent space at the variety may not be regularly defined. In case of varieties defined over the reals, this notion generalizes the notion of local non-flatness. A point of an algebraic variety that is not singular is said to be regular. An algebraic variety that has no singular point is said to be non-singular or smooth. The concept is generalized to smooth schemes in the modern language of scheme theory.

== Definition ==
A plane curve defined by an implicit equation
:formula_1,
where is a smooth function is said to be &quot;singular&quot; at a point if the Taylor series of has order at least at this point.

The reason for this is that, in differential calculus, the tangent at the point of such a curve is defined by the equation
:formula_2
whose left-hand side is the term of degree one of the Taylor expansion. Thus, if this term is zero, the tangent may not be defined in the standard way, either because it does not exist or a special definition must be provided.

In general for a hypersurface

:formula_3

the singular points are those at which all the partial derivatives simultaneously vanish. A general algebraic variety being defined as the common zeros of several polynomials, the condition on a point of to be a singular point is that the Jacobian matrix of the first-order partial derivatives of the polynomials has a rank at that is lower than the rank at other points of the variety.

Points of that are not singular are called non-singular or regular. It is always true that almost all points are non-singular, in the sense that the non-singular points form a set that is both open and dense in the variety (for the Zariski topology, as well as for the usual topology, in the case of varieties defined over the complex numbers).

In case of a real variety (that is the set of the points with real coordinates of a variety defined by polynomials with real coefficients), the variety is a manifold near every regular point. But it is important to note that a real variety may be a manifold and have singular points. For example the equation defines a real analytic manifold but has a singular point at the origin. This may be explained by saying that the curve has two complex conjugate branches that cut the real branch at the origin.

==Singular points of smooth mappings==
As the notion of singular points is a purely local property, the above definition can be extended to cover the wider class of smooth mappings (functions from to where all derivatives exist). Analysis of these singular points can be reduced to the algebraic variety case by considering the jets of the mapping. The th jet is the Taylor series of the mapping truncated at degree and deleting the constant term.

==Nodes==

In classical algebraic geometry, certain special singular points were also called nodes. A node is a singular point where the Hessian matrix is non-singular; this implies that the singular point has multiplicity two and the tangent cone is not singular outside its vertex.

<doc id="981927" wikidata="Q26883893" url="?curid=981927" title="Hildebrand">
<text>Hildebrand is a character from Germanic heroic legend. &quot;Hildebrand&quot; is the modern German form of the name: in Old High German it is &quot;Hiltibrant&quot; and in Old Norse &quot;Hildibrandr&quot;. The word &quot;hild&quot; means &quot;battle&quot; and &quot;brand&quot; means &quot;sword&quot;. The name itself is very likely of Lombardic origin.

He is associated with the cycle of legends about Theodoric the Great, called Dietrich in German, to whom he is a companion. 
Hildebrand appears in many works, most prominently in the Old High German &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot;, the Middle High German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, in the Old Norse song &quot;Hildebrand&#x27;s Death&quot; in &quot;Ásmundar saga kappabana&quot; (called &quot;Hildibrandr&quot;), and in the late medieval &quot;Jüngeres Hildebrandslied&quot;. He also appears as &quot;Hildiger&quot; in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

In the Nibelungenlied, he is the armourer, brother-in-arms, and fatherly friend of Dietrich von Bern. Hildebrand kills Kriemhild, after she orders her brother&#x27;s death and then kills Hagen herself. Hildebrand plays a supporting role to Dietrich in the numerous poems of the Dietrich cycle; in poems such as &quot;Virginal&quot; and &quot;Sigenot&quot;, Hildebrand tutors the young Dietrich and saves him from various scrapes.

In the &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot;, which is older, Hildebrand fights his own son Hadubrand. Hildebrand had gone into exile with Dietrich. 30 years later, Hildebrand returns and encounters his son Hadubrand, who is leading his army against Hildebrand. The two leaders meet between the armies. They converse before fighting, and Hadubrand says that he is &quot;Hadubrand Hildebrand&#x27;s son&quot;, but he was told that Hildebrand died, and he accuses Hildebrand of being an old Hun and refuses to believe that he is his father. The poem ends before a conclusion is reached, but in &quot;Hildebrand&#x27;s Death&quot; it is related that he killed his son. The Old Norse &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; and the &quot;Jüngeres Hildebrandslied&quot; both contain versions in which Hildebrand defeats his son (here named Alebrand) but does not kill him.

The Scandinavian song &quot;Hildebrand&#x27;s death&quot; tells how Hildebrand fights against his half-brother. He is wounded fatally by him and the shield with the picture of his son falls near to his head on the ground. He begs his half-brother to cover his body, and to bury him properly.

Although associated with historical characters from the 5th and 6th centuries, Theodoric and Odoacer, Hildebrand himself has not been identified as a historical personage.

<text>The Cheviot is a British breed of white-faced sheep. It originated in, and is named for, the Cheviot Hills in north Northumberland and the Scottish Borders. It is still common in this area of the United Kingdom, but also in north-west Scotland, Wales, Ireland and the south-west of England (especially Dartmoor and Exmoor), as well as more rarely in Australia, New Zealand, Norway (2%), and the United States. It is a dual-purpose breed, raised both for wool and for meat.

<doc id="981962" wikidata="Q1893889" url="?curid=981962" title="Marcus Klingberg">
<text>Avraham Marek Klingberg (7 October 1918 – 30 November 2015), known as Marcus Klingberg (), was a Polish-born Israeli epidemiologist and the highest ranking Soviet spy ever uncovered in Israel. Klingberg made major contributions in the fields of infectious and noninfectious disease epidemiology and military medicine, while simultaneously passing intelligence to the Soviet Union regarding Israel&#x27;s biological and chemical warfare capacities. Declared the &quot;most important Soviet spy in Israel&quot; by the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Klingberg is regarded as causing the greatest damage ever to the country&#x27;s national security interests.

Originally from a family of rabbis, Klingberg chose a secular education in high school. Entering medical school in Warsaw in 1935, his studies were cut short by the German invasion in 1939. He fled Poland for the Soviet Union, completing his medical degree in Minsk and joining the Red Army in 1941. Injured on the front lines, he was reassinged to a military unit dealing with disease outbreaks. In 1943, he served as Chief Epidemiologist of the Byelorussian Republic. Repatriated to Poland following the end of the war, he became Acting Chief Epidemiologist at the Polish Ministry of Health.

Having lost his entire family but a single cousin in the Holocaust, Klingberg migrated to Israel. He served in the Israel Defence Force from 1948 to 1953. In 1957, he joined the clandestine Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), responsible for the country&#x27;s biological and chemical weapons, as Deputy Scientific Director. By his own admission, he was motivated by ideological reasons and began passing information to the Soviet Union. Despite coming under suspicion by counter-intelligence, his activies were not discovered until 1983, seven years after his retirement from the IIBR. Arrested and convicted of espionage in secret, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, being held in solitary confinement for the first decade. While the circumstances of his detention were revealed internationally in 1988, domestic reporting on Klingberg was suppressed in Israel for a further five years. Paroled to home detention in 1998 due to ill health, he was permitted to move to Paris in 2003 to live with his daughter on the condition that he never speak of his work in the areas of biological and chemical weapons. He spent the remaining years of his life re-engaged in academic work and completing his memoirs.

==Early life==
Klingberg was born in Warsaw, Poland, on 7 October 1918, to a Hasidic Jewish family of rabbinical lineage. In his youth, he lived for a time with his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Klingberg. His parents sent him to a &quot;cheder&quot;, a religious primary school. As a teenager, he abandoned religion and attended a secular high school.

In 1935, Klingberg began studying medicine at the University of Warsaw. In 1939, with the German invasion of Poland, Klingberg&#x27;s father urged him to flee to the Soviet Union, completing his medical studies in Minsk in 1941. His parents and younger brother, who remained in Poland, were murdered in 1942 in the Treblinka extermination camp. Other than a single cousin, his entire family perished.

== World War II ==
On 22 June 1941, the first day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Klingberg volunteered for the Red Army. He served as a medical officer on the front lines until October 1941, when he was wounded in the leg by shrapnel. Upon recovery, he was assigned to Perm in the Urals as leader of an anti-epidemic unit.

In 1943, he undertook postgraduate studies in epidemiology at the in Moscow under , considered the leading Soviet epidemiologist. The same year, he was part of a team that stopped an epidemic in the Urals. He also contributed to research on typhoid fever. In late December 1943, the first parts of Byelorussia were retaken by the Red Army and Klingberg became Chief Epidemiologist of the Byelorussian Republic.

At the end of the war, Klingberg was discharged from the Red Army with the rank of captain and returned to Poland. In Warsaw, he served as Acting Chief Epidemiologist at the Polish Ministry of Health.

While living in post-war Poland, Klingberg met Adjia Eisman, who went by the name Wanda Jasinska, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto. Similarly to Klingberg, her parents and siblings were murdered in the Holocaust. Klingberg and Jasinska married in 1946 and moved to Sweden, where their daughter, Sylvia, was born in 1947.

== Military and scientific career ==
In November 1948, Klingberg immigrated with his wife and daughter to Israel, during the closing stages of the War of Independence. Some sections of Shin Bet believed the immigration to have been prompted by Soviet intelligence, but Klingberg strongly denied this, saying he was motivated by the loss of his family in Poland during the Holocaust.

Upon arrival in Israel, he was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces, serving in the Medical Corps. In March 1950, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel (Sgan Aluf). He served as Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine, Office of the Surgeon General, and afterward founded and directed the Central Research Laboratories for Military Medicine. His work included some of the first research into West Nile fever.

In 1957, he was one of the founders of the top-secret Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona, where he served as Deputy Scientific Director until 1972. In 1969, Klingberg joined the Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, where he was Professor of Epidemiology and Head of the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine from 1978 to 1983.

Klingberg&#x27;s academic career and research papers earned him an international reputation in his field, and he was invited to conferences by the World Health Organization. He was president of the European Teratology Society (1980–1982) and a co-founder and chairman (1979–1981) of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). In 1976, he was elected chair of an international advisory committee established by the Italian government to study the effects of the Seveso Accident. He was elected to the council of the International Epidemiological Association for the 1981–1984 term.

Klingberg conducted sabbaticals at the Henry Phipps Institute, University of Pennsylvania (1962 to 1964); at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (1972); at the Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1973); and at the Department of Social and Community Medicine, University of Oxford. He became a Visiting Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford in 1978.

== Espionage activities ==

According to Klingberg&#x27;s indictment, which was based on his confession, he began spying in 1957, although in his memoirs he indicates the date was actually 1950. Klingberg passed information on Israel&#x27;s chemical and biological weapons research, frequently using the Russian Orthodox Church in Abu Kabir as his contact point with the KGB. In the 1950s, Klingberg was secretly awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, at the time the Soviet Union&#x27;s second highest honour, in recognition of his services. Klingberg has indicated that sometime around the mid-1950s he considered ceasing to pass information to the Soviets, but he concluded that the relationship would become coercive and that he preferred to &quot;maintain voluntary relations.&quot;

Klingberg confided in his espionage activities with his wife and she collaborated with him in passing intelligence to the Soviets, including personally handling what Klingberg termed a &quot;particularly virulent strain of bacteria.&quot; Interrogated following her husband&#x27;s arrest in 1983, Jasinska never admitted involvement in spying.

Israeli journalists Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez have suggested that Klingberg&#x27;s intelligence on Israeli offensive capabilities led the Soviet Union to provide Egypt with chemical and biological defensive capabilities in the lead up to the Six-Day War in 1967. Martin McCauley, a specialist in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, has said the Soviets may have passed Klingberg&#x27;s information to multiple Arab countries.

Israel&#x27;s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies, Mossad and Shin Bet, began to suspect Klingberg of espionage in the 1960s, but brought no results. While at the Institute for Biological Research, he was twice summoned by the authorities due to suspicions of being a foreign agent. Klingberg refuted these claims. In 1965, he passed a polygraph test, according to Israeli journalist Yossi Melman, due to the fact that his interrogators simply asked the wrong questions, as they suspected he was spying for Polish rather than Soviet intelligence.

Klingberg retired from the Israel Institute for Biological Research in 1976, and contact with Soviet intelligence lapsed.

== Capture, trial and detention ==
In 1972, a newly arrived Jewish migrant from the Soviet Union admitted to working for the KGB during Shin Bet screening, and he became double agent for the agency. In 1982, when the KGB instructed this agent to reestablish contact with Klingberg, Shin Bet acquired circumstantial evidence of Klingberg&#x27;s links to Soviet intelligence. However, the evidence was not considered strong enough to secure a conviction of espionage. An operation codenamed &quot;Reef&quot; was planned to obtain a confession.

In January 1983, Shin Bet officers informed Klingberg they wanted to send him to Southeast Asia, where a chemical plant had allegedly exploded. After leaving home with his suitcase, he was taken to an apartment in an undisclosed location and detained. Initially denying any wrongdoing, he was interrogated harshly and, by his own account, he attempted suicide three times. After ten days, Klingberg admitted to passing intelligence to the Soviets and signed a confession indicating he had been blackmailed into spying. He told his interrogators that he had not completed his medical studies and lacked a diploma, and that the KGB had threatened to expose this.

Klingberg was tried in secret and sentenced to 20 years in prison. For the first 10 years of his sentence, he was held in solitary confinement in a high-security prison in Ashkelon under a false identity as a publisher named Abraham Grinberg. After he was removed from solitary confinement, his cellmate was Shimon Levinson, another Israeli who spied for the Soviet Union. 

Klingberg&#x27;s daughter emigrated to France in the 1970s and, upon learning of her father&#x27;s imprisonment, privately campaigned to have his prison conditions improved. She enlisted the support of French lawyer Antoine Comte in Paris, who engaged Wolfgang Vogel in East Berlin in an attempt to have Klingberg released via support from East Germany and the Soviet Union. In 1988–89, East Germany and the Soviet Union began negotiations with Israel, where a proposal was tentatively agreed to release Klingberg, along with Shabtai Kalmanovich, in exchange for the Soviet Union providing information on the location of Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator believed to be held in Lebanon. With the downfall of communism in Eastern Europe, the deal fell apart.

Due to the investigations of British journalist Peter Pringle, Israeli authorities acknowledged Klingberg&#x27;s conviction and imprisonment in 1988. Reporting of his circumstances inside Israel remained prohibited.

In 1997, Amnesty International appealed to the Israeli government to release Klingberg on medical grounds as he had had several strokes. During his application for early release, former Shin Bet director Yaakov Peri acted as a character witness. In September 1998, he was approved to leave prison but subject to house arrest.

At his expense, a camera connected to the offices of the Director of Security of the Defense Establishment (MALMAB), was installed in his apartment. His telephone was tapped, with his knowledge. Guards from MALMAB were assigned to him, and Klingberg had to pay their salaries. Klingberg signed a commitment not to speak about his work. In 1999, a court ordered him to cease speaking Yiddish and Russian at home as the guards could not understand those languages and therefore could not monitor his conversations. In order to pay for the guards and the camera, Klingberg took loans and eventually had to sell his apartment.

Interviewed in 2008, Klingberg maintained that he had spied out of ideological reasons, but had lied to his interrogators as he believed claiming to have been blackmailed would result in lighter treatment. When asked why he spied for the Soviet Union, Klingberg stated, &quot;I felt it was the right thing to do ... Because of the Cold War. I wanted the two blocs in the Cold War to be the same thing, out of a desire for a more balanced world.&quot; In a 2014 interview, Klingberg noted he felt he owed the Soviet Union a debt for saving the world from the Nazis. He said he had always been a communist and had recruited his wife and two friends.

== Release and later life ==
 In January 2003, Klingberg was released from house arrest and immediately left Israel for Paris to be with his daughter Sylvia and grandson Ian Brossat. Klingberg moved to a one-room apartment in Paris but did not take French citizenship. He frequently lectured on medicine at universities. He helped establish the Ludwik Fleck Center of the , a university center in Zürich, and delivered the opening lecture. He received an officer&#x27;s pension from the Israeli government, which amounted to around €2,000 a month. Klingberg continued to have medical problems and was frequently hospitalized.

Klingberg&#x27;s memoirs, (&quot;The Last Spy&quot;), written with his lawyer, Michael Sfard, were published in 2007. The book was received harshly in Israel, with reviewers from Haaretz and Ynet calling him, respectively, &quot;a childish and pitiful person&quot; and &quot;a scoundrel&quot;.

Klingberg&#x27;s spying and imprisonment affected the life of his grandson, Ian Brossat, a politician elected to the French Senate in September 2023. During his early childhood, he did not know Klingberg was in jail, believing him to be in hospital; later, he was never allowed to speak of his grandfather&#x27;s imprisonment. In 2009, when he won a seat on the Council of Paris, Brossat noted how his political opponents attempted to tarnish him by association with Klingberg. Klingberg, towards the end of his life, said he was proud of his grandson.

== Death ==
Klingberg died in Paris on 30 November 2015, aged 97, with his death covered in many of the world&#x27;s newspapers of record. He was cremated and his ashes interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery next to those of his wife, who had died of heart failure in 1990. 

Following his death, Yaakov Peri named Klingberg as, &quot;one of the top Soviet spies in Israel – if not the greatest one ever.” &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; called him, &quot;the most important spy that the Soviets employed in Israel.&quot;

<text>James William Dickinson MBE (24 April 1925 – 8 November 1982) was an English footballer who played as a left half.

Dickinson holds the record for number of league appearances for Portsmouth (764). Only Swindon Town&#x27;s John Trollope and Milton Keynes Dons&#x27; Dean Lewington have made more appearances for a single club.

He signed for Portsmouth as a trainee and made his debut in 1946 against Blackburn Rovers. Settling into the side quickly at either wing-half or left-half, he was part of the team that won successive league championships in 1948–49 and 1949–50. His performances earned him a call-up to the England national team. He went on to win 48 caps for England, making him Portsmouth&#x27;s most capped English player of all time. During his record 845 club appearances for Pompey and his 48 England caps he was never once booked or sent off, earning him the nickname &#x27;Gentleman Jim&#x27;.

As of 2022, he remains the only England player ever to have scored an own goal at the FIFA World Cup, scoring past his own goalkeeper in a 4–4 draw against Belgium in 1954.

Awarded the MBE for services to football in 1964, he played his last match for Pompey a year later, helping Pompey to a 1–1 end-of-season draw at Northampton Town that secured safety from relegation. And when he retired from playing, his association with the club continued. He served Pompey as public relations officer and then secretary before accepting the position of manager in May 1977. Relegation from the Third Division was avoided, but the next year Pompey dropped down a league.

After three heart attacks, Dickinson died aged 57 in 1982. The famous &#x27;Pompey Chimes&#x27; were played in St Mary&#x27;s Church in Fratton at a packed memorial service. He is buried in Alton Cemetery.

In 1998, he was included on the list of 100 Legends produced to celebrate the centenary of the Football League.

Dickinson&#x27;s image can be seen in the seating in the Fratton End stand in Fratton Park.

In his home town of Alton there is a pub named The Gentleman Jim and Dickinson Road in Portsmouth was named in his honour.

On 23 September 2023, a bronze statue of Dickinson by Douglas Jennings was unveiled at Fratton Park by Jimmy&#x27;s son Andrew Dickinson and former Portsmouth goalkeeper, Alan Knight. The statue was commissioned by the Pompey Supporters&#x27; Trust and crowdfunded by fans of the club.

<text>Daniel Joseph Bartlett (born June 1, 1971) is an American political advisor who served as counselor to the president and communications director in the administration of George W. Bush.

==Early life and education==
Bartlett grew up in Rockwall, Texas and is a 1989 graduate of Rockwall High School. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in political science from the University of Texas at Austin.

==Political career==
=== Bush gubernatorial staff (1990s) ===
Bartlett worked on George W. Bush&#x27;s first campaign for governor in 1994, when Bush unseated Ann W. Richards. He was appointed as deputy to the policy director in the governor&#x27;s office and was issues director for Bush&#x27;s 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign.

=== Bush 2000 presidential campaign ===
Bartlett was the director of rapid response for George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign.

=== White House communications director (2001-2005) ===
After Bush assumed office as president, he worked as a deputy to advisor Karen Hughes before being named White House communications director.

Following the July 6, 2003, editorial by former ambassador Joseph Wilson, Bartlett (with Ari Fleischer) pushed reporters to pursue who in the CIA sent him to Niger, but stopped short of revealing that his wife worked for the agency.

On September 1, 2004, Bartlett appeared on the &quot;Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; on the second night of the 2004 Republican National Convention, where he discussed the convention and campaign.

=== Counselor to the president (2005-2007) ===
On January 5, 2005, the White House announced that Bartlett would assume the role of counselor to the president, which allows him to focus more broadly on strategic communication and the formulation of policy. He has also worked for Karl Rove&#x27;s political consulting firm. On June 1, 2007, Bartlett announced his resignation as Counsel to the President.

=== Post-resignation controversies ===
At the end of 2007, during an interview after having left the White House, Bartlett implied some conservative bloggers, such as Hugh Hewitt, were unfiltered mouthpieces for the GOP and the Bush White House.I mean, talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support. It&#x27;s a very efficient way to communicate. They regurgitate exactly and put up on their blogs what you said to them. It is something that we&#x27;ve cultivated and have really tried to put quite a bit of focus on.In May 2008, Bartlett appeared on various media outlets casting aspersions on the contentions raised by Scott McClellan in his book &quot;What Happened&quot; that the administration had repeatedly &quot;shaded the truth&quot; in connection with justifying the Iraq War, and describing the role that various administration officials played in the Valerie Plame leak case. In a May 2008 telephone interview with CNN, Bartlett &quot;asserted that McClellan did not play a major role in key events, noting that the former aide was serving as deputy press secretary for domestic issues during the run-up to the war in Iraq, raising questions about how McClellan could claim the President used &#x27;propaganda&#x27; to sell the war.&quot;

== Consulting ==
On October 28, 2007, Public Strategies, Inc., a business advisory firm, announced they had hired Bartlett as a senior strategist. In March 2009, Bartlett was named president and CEO of Public Strategies.

== Academia ==
In January 2009, Bartlett was named an adjunct faculty member at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, at which he taught a seminar on media and politics.

== Walmart (2013 - present) ==

<text>James Reese Europe (February 22, 1880 – May 9, 1919) was an American ragtime and early jazz bandleader, arranger, and composer. He was the leading figure on the African-American music scene of New York City in the 1910s. Eubie Blake called him the &quot;Martin Luther King of music&quot;.

== Early life ==
Europe was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Henry Jefferson Europe (1848–1899) and Loraine Saxon &quot;(maiden;&quot; 1849–1930). His family – which included four siblings, Minnie Europe (Mrs. George Mayfield; 1868–1931), Ida S. Europe (1870–1919), John Newton Europe (1875–1932), and Mary Loraine (1883–1947) – moved to Washington, D.C., when he was 10 years old.

Europe moved to New York in 1904. He had a son, James Reese Europe Jr (1917–2001) with Bessie Simms (1888–1931).

== Band leader ==

In 1910, Europe organized the Clef Club, a society for Black Americans in the music industry. In 1912, the club made history when it played a concert at Carnegie Hall for the benefit of the Colored Music Settlement School. The Clef Club Orchestra, while not a jazz band, was the first band to play proto-jazz at Carnegie Hall. It is difficult to overstate the importance of that event in the history of jazz in the United States – it was 12 years before the Paul Whiteman and George Gershwin concert at Aeolian Hall, and 26 years before Benny Goodman&#x27;s famed concert at Carnegie Hall. The Clef Club&#x27;s performances played music written solely by Black composers, including Harry T. Burleigh and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Europe&#x27;s orchestra also included Will Marion Cook, who had not been in Carnegie Hall since his own performance as solo violinist in 1896. Cook was the first black composer to launch full musical productions, fully scored with a cast and story every bit as classical as any Victor Herbert operetta. In the words of Gunther Schuller, Europe &quot;... had stormed the bastion of the white establishment and made many members of New York&#x27;s cultural elite aware of Negro music for the first time&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;These composers are beginning to form an art of their own&quot;; yet by their third performance, a review in &quot;Musical America&quot; said Europe&#x27;s Clef Club should &quot;give its attention during the coming year to a movement or two of a Haydn Symphony&quot;.

In 1913 and 1914, he made a series of phonograph records for the Victor Talking Machine Company. These recordings are some of the best examples of the pre-jazz hot ragtime style of the U.S. Northeast of the 1910s. Although the Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB), a group of white musicians, later claimed to have made the first &quot;jass&quot; or jazz recordings for Victor in 1917, earlier recordings by Reese and other Black American musicians preceded and inspired the ODJB, even if they were not called nor marketed as &quot;jazz&quot; at the time.

Neither the Clef Club Orchestra nor the Society Orchestra were small &quot;Dixieland&quot; style bands. They were large symphonic bands to satisfy the tastes of a public that was used to performances by the likes of the John Philip Sousa band and similar organizations very popular at the time. The Clef Orchestra had 125 members; they played on various occasions between 1912 and 1915 in Carnegie Hall. It is instructive to read a comment from a music review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from March 12, 1914: &quot;... the program consisted largely of plantation melodies and spirituals [arranged such as to show that] these composers are beginning to develop an art of their own based on their folk material ...&quot;

Europe was known for his outspoken personality and unwillingness to bend to musical conventions, particularly in his insistence on playing his own style of music. He responded to criticism by saying, &quot;We have developed a kind of symphony music that, no matter what else you think, is different and distinctive, and that lends itself to the playing of the peculiar compositions of our race ... My success had come ... from a realization of the advantages of sticking to the music of my own people.&quot; And later, &quot;We colored people have our own music that is part of us. It&#x27;s the product of our souls; it&#x27;s been created by the sufferings and miseries of our race.&quot;

He was one of the first African-American musicians to make it into the mainstream.

== Compositions ==
Some of Europe&#x27;s best-known compositions include several that were co-composed with Ford Dabney (1883–1958) for the famed dancers Irene and Vernon Castle. The Castles regarded Europe&#x27;s Society Orchestra among the best they had worked with and hired Europe late in 1913 as their preferred band leader with Dabney as their arranger.

== Military service ==

During World War I, Europe obtained a commission in the New York Army National Guard, where he fought as a second lieutenant with the 369th Infantry Regiment (the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters&quot;) He was given command of the regiment&#x27;s machine gun company and also tasked with directing the regimental band, which would later achieve great acclaim. When the regiment shipped out, it did so quietly, without the farewell parade given to other New York units.

Upon arriving in France, the 369th Infantry was assigned to the French Army, as the American Expeditionary Forces refused to field African American soldiers in combat. The unit saw 191 days of combat, more than any other American regiment during the war. The first Croix de Guerre medals awarded to Americans were given to members of the 369th. Europe was responsible for training his men in the use of Chauchat machine guns and hand grenades.

Europe also became the first African American officer to lead troops into battle. After suffering from a gas attack, he was incapacitated but later recovered. By February and March 1918, Europe had recuperated enough to lead his regimental band on a tour of France, performing for British, French, and American audiences as well as French civilians. The band traveled over 2,000 miles and introduced jazz to European audiences, boosting morale. Europe&#x27;s &quot;Hellfighters&quot; also made their first recordings in France for the Pathé brothers. The first concert included a French march, and the &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, as well as syncopated numbers such as &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot;, which, according to a later description of the concert by band member Noble Sissle &quot;... started ragtimitis in France&quot;. The &quot;Hellfighters&quot; were the first New York unit to return home.

== Post-war career ==

After his return home in February 1919, he stated: &quot;I have come from France more firmly convinced than ever that Negros should write Negro music. We have our own racial feeling and if we try to copy whites we will make bad copies ... We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, and if we are to develop in America we must develop along our own lines.&quot; In 1919, Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, which gives us the classic song &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;. Differing in style from Europe&#x27;s recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences.

== Death ==

On the night of May 9, 1919, Europe performed for the last time. He had been feeling ill all day, but wanted to go on with the concert (which was to be the first of three in Boston&#x27;s Mechanics Hall). During the intermission Europe went to have a talk with two of his drummers, Steve and Herbert Wright. After Europe criticized some of their behavior (walking off stage during others&#x27; performances), Herbert Wright became very agitated and threw his drumsticks down in a seemingly unwarranted outburst of anger. He claimed Europe did not treat him well and that he was tired of getting blamed for others&#x27; mistakes. He lunged for Europe with a penknife and was able to stab him in the neck. Europe told his band to finish the set and he would see them the next morning. To Europe and his band the wound seemed superficial. As he was carried away, he told them &quot;I&#x27;ll get along alright.&quot; At the hospital, they could not stop the bleeding and he died hours later.

News of Europe&#x27;s death spread fast. Composer and band leader W. C. Handy wrote: &quot;The man who had just come through the baptism of war&#x27;s fire and steel without a mark had been stabbed by one of his own musicians ... The sun was in the sky. The new day promised peace. But all the suns had gone down for Jim Europe, and Harlem didn&#x27;t seem the same.&quot; Europe was granted the first ever public funeral for a black American in the city of New York. Tanney Johnson said of his death: &quot;Before Jim Europe came to New York, the colored man knew nothing but Negro dances and porter&#x27;s work. All that has been changed. Jim Europe was the living open sesame to the colored porters of this city. He took them from their porters&#x27; places and raised them to positions of importance as real musicians. I think the suffering public ought to know that in Jim Europe, the race has lost a leader, a benefactor, and a true friend.&quot;

At the time of his death, he was the best-known black-American bandleader in the United States. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. Europe was mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;No Flowers&quot;.

Herbert Wright was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to fifteen years, but was released early after eight years on good behavior.

<text>Requirements engineering (RE) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering.

The first use of the term &quot;requirements engineering&quot; was probably in 1964 in the conference paper &quot;Maintenance, Maintainability, and System Requirements Engineering&quot;, but it did not come into general use until the late 1990s with the publication of an IEEE Computer Society tutorial in March 1997 and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the International Requirements Engineering Conference.

In the waterfall model, requirements engineering is presented as the first phase of the development process. Later development methods, including the Rational Unified Process (RUP) for software, assume that requirements engineering continues through a system&#x27;s lifetime.

Requirements management, which is a sub-function of Systems Engineering practices, is also indexed in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) manuals.

== Activities ==
The activities involved in requirements engineering vary widely, depending on the type of system being developed and the organization&#x27;s specific practice(s) involved. These may include:

#Requirements inception or requirements elicitation – Developers and stakeholders meet; the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the software product.
#Requirements analysis and negotiation – Requirements are identified (including new ones if the development is iterative), and conflicts with stakeholders are solved. Both written and graphical tools (the latter commonly used in the design phase, but some find them helpful at this stage, too) are successfully used as aids. Examples of written analysis tools: use cases and user stories. Examples of graphical tools: Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML).
#System modeling – Some engineering fields (or specific situations) require the product to be completely designed and modeled before its construction or fabrication starts. Therefore, the design phase must be performed in advance. For instance, blueprints for a building must be elaborated before any contract can be approved and signed. Many fields might derive models of the system with the LML, whereas others, might use UML. Note: In many fields, such as software engineering, most modeling activities are classified as design activities and not as requirement engineering activities.
#Requirements specification – Requirements are documented in a formal artifact called a Requirements Specification (RS), which will become official only after validation. A RS can contain both written and graphical (models) information if necessary. Example: Software requirements specification (SRS).
#Requirements validation – Checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the stakeholder&#x27;s needs. Only if the final draft passes the validation process, the RS becomes official.
#Requirements management – Managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception, supervising as the system is developed, and even until after it is put into use (e. g., changes, extensions, etc.)

These are sometimes presented as chronological stages although, in practice, there is considerable interleaving of these activities.

Requirements engineering has been shown to clearly contribute to software project successes.

==Problems==
One limited study in Germany presented possible problems in implementing requirements engineering and asked respondents whether they agreed that they were actual problems. The results were not presented as being generalizable but suggested that the principal perceived problems were incomplete requirements, moving targets, and time boxing, with lesser problems being communications flaws, lack of traceability, terminological problems, and unclear responsibilities.

==Criticism==
Problem structuring, a key aspect of requirements engineering, has been speculated to reduce design performance. Some research suggests that it is possible if there are deficiencies in the requirements engineering process resulting in a situation where requirements do not exist, software requirements may be created regardless as an illusion misrepresenting design decisions as requirements

<doc id="981983" wikidata="Q1200733" url="?curid=981983" title="Divestment">
<text>In finance and economics, divestment or divestiture is the reduction of some kind of asset for financial, ethical, or political objectives or sale of an existing business by a firm. A divestment is the opposite of an investment. Divestiture is an adaptive change and adjustment of a company&#x27;s ownership and business portfolio made to confront with internal and external changes.

== Motives ==
Firms may have several motives for divestitures:

# a firm may divest (sell) businesses that are not part of its core operations so that it can focus on what it does best. For example, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor Company, Future Group and many other firms have sold various businesses that were not closely related to their core businesses.
# to obtain funds. Divestitures generate funds for the firm because it is selling one of its businesses in exchange for cash. For example, CSX Corporation made divestitures to focus on its core railroad business and also to obtain funds so that it could pay off some of its existing debt.
# a firm&#x27;s &quot;break-up&quot; value is sometimes believed to be greater than the value of the firm as a whole. In other words, the sum of a firm&#x27;s individual asset liquidation values exceeds the market value of the firm&#x27;s combined assets. This encourages firms to sell off what would be worth more when liquidated than when retained.
# divesting a part of a firm may enhance stability. Philips, for example, divested its chip division - NXP - because the chip market was so volatile and unpredictable that NXP was responsible for the majority of Philips&#x27;s stock fluctuations while it represented only a very small part of Philips NV.
# divesting a part of a company may eliminate a division which is under-performing or even failing.
# regulatory authorities may demand divestiture, for example in order to create competition.
# pressure from shareholders for social reasons (sometimes also called disinvestment). Examples include disinvestment from South Africa in the former era of apartheid (now ended), disinvestment from Israel due to the occupation of the Palestinian territories, disinvestment from Russia due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and calls for fossil fuel divestment in response to climate change.

=== Divestment for financial goals ===

Often the term is used as a means to grow financially in which a company sells off a business unit in order to focus their resources on a market it judges to be more profitable, or promising. Sometimes, such an action can be a spin-off. In the United States, divestment of certain parts of a company can occur when required by the Federal Trade Commission before a merger with another firm is approved. A company can divest assets to wholly owned subsidiaries.

It is a process of selling an asset. 
The largest corporate divestiture in history was the 1984 U.S. Department of Justice-mandated breakup of the Bell System into AT&amp;T and the seven Baby Bells.

Of the 1000 largest global companies, those that are actively involved in both acquiring and divesting create as much as 1.5 to 4.7 percentage points higher shareholder returns than those primarily focused on acquisitions.

=== Divestment for social goals ===
Examples of divestment for social goals include:
* Disinvestment from Israel, a movement by critics of Israel (since 1920s)
* Disinvestment from South Africa in the former era of apartheid (1960s-1990s)
* Tobacco industry divestment, coordinated by the NGO Tobacco-Free Portfolios (since 2000s)
* Fossil fuel divestment in response to global warming, coordinated by the NGO 350.org (since 2010s)
* Factory farming divestment and big livestock divestment in response to environmental destruction, animal suffering, and human health concerns, coordinated by NGO Feedback Global.

== Method of divestment ==

Some firms are using technology to facilitate the process of divesting some divisions. They post the information about any division that they wish to sell on their website so that it is available to any firm that may be interested in buying the division. For example, Alcoa has established an online showroom of the divisions that are for sale. By communicating the information online, Alcoa has reduced its hotel, travel, and meeting expenses.

Firms use transitional service agreements to increase the strategic benefits of divestitures.

Divestment execution includes five critical work streams: governance, tax, carve-out financial statements, deal-basis information, and operational separation. Companies often create cross-disciplined teams composed of IT, HR, legal, tax, and other key business units, to implement a business separation.

With economic liberalization of the Indian economy, India&#x27;s Ministry of Finance set up a separate Department of Disinvestments.

<text>Rawdon Hume &quot;Ron&quot; Middleton, VC (22 July 1916 – 29 November 1942) was a bomber pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force and a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
 Middleton was born on 22 July 1916 in Waverley, Sydney at Nurse Nettleton&#x27;s Private Hospital. His younger brother, Osman (a Middleton family name), was born in 1918. His parents had married in 1914. His mother was Faith Lillian (born Millar) and his father Francis Rawdon Middleton, known as Frank, who had been raised at Burrowa. Rawdon Middleton&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Jessie Huon Middleton, née Hume, was the niece of the colonial explorer, Hamilton Hume. Rawdon Middleton spent the main part of his early years in the Central Western districts of New South Wales where his father was employed managing farming properties.

His father, known as Frank, was working at Muswellbrook in 1914. At some time after his marriage Frank was managing &quot;Warrah&quot; station on the Liverpool Plains of NSW, where in 1920 he was on the Warrah Cricket Association committee. Ron Middleton was a young child on &#x27;Warrah&#x27;, a very large pastoral property owned by the Australian Agricultural Company and had its own school. FR Middleton left &#x27;Warrah&#x27; when Ron was aged 7&amp;1/2 years. The family then moved to &#x27;Kelvin Grove&#x27;, a smaller farming property near Wallerawang in the Lithgow area. In 1927 Frank Middleton took up the position of station manager on &#x27;Alloway&#x27; at Gilgandra for its new owner Mr Geoffrey Mosse of Darling Point, Sydney.

Ron lived on &#x27;Alloway&#x27; from the age of 9. He and his brother initially attended the one-teacher Buramilong school on a nearby property and then attended Gilgandra school for his Intermediate Certificate 1930–1932. The optional Leaving Certificate was not provided at the Gilgandra school at that time, so when Ron reached that stage of his schooling he boarded in 1933–34 in Dubbo, 40 miles away, to complete his final two years of high school. At Dubbo High School a memorial trust in his name has been operating for many years. He was an athletic young man who competed regularly as a teenager in Gilgandra tennis competitions, played for the Gilgandra district&#x27;s Berida cricket team and excelled in cricket and rugby football at school. He represented Dubbo High for tennis in the Astley Cup. The family left &#x27;Alloway&#x27; in September 1934. They moved to &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, Kentucky, near Uralla (Tamworth area) where Frank was again the station manager.

The family moved once more to Leewang station near Parkes where Frank was again the station manager. Ron Middleton joined his father here, working as a jackaroo. He was working on that property at the time of his enlistment.

He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 14 October 1940, and trained as a pilot in the Empire Air Training Scheme. He undertook initial flying training at No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School (5 EFTS) Narromine, and advanced training in Canada. In February 1942 he joined No. 149 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, flying as second pilot on Short Stirling bombers. By July of that year he was appointed as an aircraft captain, and flew his first raid as a pilot-in-command against Düsseldorf.

==Victoria Cross action==
On 28 November 1942, Middleton was captain of Stirling BF372 detailed to bomb the Fiat aircraft works at Turin. It was his twenty-ninth combat sortie, one short of the thirty required for completion of a &#x27;tour&#x27; and mandatory rotation off combat operations.

Middleton and his crew arrived above Turin after a difficult flight over the Alps, due to the low combat ceiling of the &quot;bombed-up&quot; and &quot;fueled-up&quot; Stirling (This was due to its short stubby wings, which were designed to keep the wing span low enough to fit in a standard RAF hanger, but which were unable to carry the aircraft to high altitudes.) Over the target area Middleton had to make three low-level passes in order to positively identify the target; on the third, the aircraft was hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire which wounded both pilots and the wireless operator. Middleton suffered numerous grievous wounds, including shrapnel wounds to the arms, legs and body, having his right eye torn from its socket and his jaw shattered.

He passed out briefly, and his second pilot, Flight Sergeant L.A. Hyder, who was also seriously wounded, managed to regain control of the plunging plane at 800 feet and drop the bombs, before receiving first aid from the other crew. Middleton regained consciousness in time to help recover control of his stricken bomber. Middleton was in great pain, was barely able to see, was losing blood from wounds all over his body, and could breathe only with difficulty. He must have known that his own chances of survival were slim, but he nonetheless determined to fly his crippled aircraft home, and return his crew to safety. During the return flight he frequently said over the intercom &quot;I&#x27;ll make the English Coast. I&#x27;ll get you home&quot;. After four hours of agony and having been further damaged by flak over France, Middleton reached the coast of England with five minutes of fuel reserves. At this point he turned the aircraft parallel to the coast and ordered his crew to bail out. Five of his crew did so and landed safely, but his front gunner and flight engineer remained with him to try to talk him into a forced landing on the coast, something he must have known would have risked extensive civilian casualties. He steered the aircraft out over the sea, off Dymchurch, and ordered the last two crew to bail out. They then too bailed out, but did not survive the night in the English Channel. Middleton stayed with the aircraft, which crashed into the Channel. His body was washed ashore on 1 February 1943.

The last line of his Victoria Cross citation reads: &quot;His devotion to duty in the face of overwhelming odds is unsurpassed in the annals of the Royal Air Force&quot;.

Middleton was posthumously promoted to pilot officer, and is buried at Beck Row, [Mildenhall], Suffolk. His Victoria Cross and uniform are displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

Pilot Officers George Royde (navigator) and Norman Skinner (wireless operator) were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Flight Sergeant Leslie Hyder (2nd pilot), Flight Sergeant Douglas Cameron (mid-upper gunner) and Sergeant H.W. Gough (rear gunner) each received the Distinguished Flying Medal. Coincidentally, Cameron (as a flying officer) would be a member of Squadron Leader Ian Willoughby Bazalgette&#x27;s crew when the Canadian would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in 1944.

==Legacy==
Middleton has been honoured by the naming of the mess, the &#x27;Middleton VC Club&#x27; at 1 RAAF Recruit Training Unit, RAAF Base Wagga.

He was on one of 1995 Australia Remembers 45c stamps.

The dining hall located at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk is named after Middleton.

In Parkes NSW, there is a street and Middleton Public School named for him

In Gilgandra NSW, the road that leads to the local Aerodrome - Middleton Memorial Drive - is named in his honour.

In Dubbo NSW, in Victoria Park adjacent to the Cenotaph, there is a bronze bust of him with a plaque with his VC citation.

<text>Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of volcanologist David A. Johnston, who was Glicken&#x27;s mentor and supervisor in Spring 1980 at Mount St. Helens. Glicken was initially assigned to the USGS observation post in the weeks leading up to the eruption but was called away the night before the eruption.

In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later and were cremated in accordance with his parents&#x27; request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.

Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because there was a hiring freeze for federal agencies when he graduated with his PhD. While conducting research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at Mount St. Helens titled &quot;Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington&quot; that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

Since being published posthumously by Glicken&#x27;s colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.

== Life and career ==

=== Early work ===
Glicken was born in 1958 to Milton and Ida Glicken. He graduated from Stanford University in 1980. Later that year, while a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was temporarily hired by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to help monitor the volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington state. St. Helens, dormant since the 1840s and 1850s, resumed activity in March 1980.

As seismic and volcanic activity increased, volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing lava domes, and, on May 1, 1980, established the Coldwater I and II observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Glicken monitored the volcano for two weeks, taking shelter in a trailer at the Coldwater II site located a little more than northwest of the volcano.

On May 18, 1980, after working for six days straight, Glicken took the day off to attend an interview for his graduate work with his professor, Richard V. Fisher, in Mammoth Lakes, California. His research adviser and mentor David A. Johnston replaced him at his post, despite expressing concerns about its safety given indications of mobile magma within the volcano. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide at 8:32 a.m., Mount St. Helens erupted. Johnston was killed after he was enveloped by swift pyroclastic flows that accelerated down the mountain&#x27;s flanks traveling at least 300 miles per hour (480 kilometers per hour).

After the eruption, Glicken went to Toutle High School, the center for relief efforts, where he joined Air Force Reserve Rescue Squadron officials in a helicopter to look for Johnston or any sign of his post. Despite searching with three separate crews over a span of nearly six hours, Glicken found no trace. He attempted to enlist a fourth helicopter crew to aid his search, but they declined, fearing dangerous conditions. In his distraught state, Glicken refused to accept Johnston&#x27;s death, and had to be comforted by Swanson before calming down.

In mid-1980, after the May eruption, USGS Survey scientists decided to establish the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, intending to closely monitor volcanoes in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Glicken returned to St. Helens hoping to join the &#x27;autopsy&#x27; team. However, every aspect of the eruption had been claimed by different survey scientists, and as a doctoral student at UC Santa Barbara studying with Richard Fisher, Glicken was not a survey employee.

Instead, he found work with newly appointed Survey employee Barry Voight, a specialist in landslides. Under Voight&#x27;s guidance, Glicken absorbed himself in his work, motivated to earn a job at the Survey, and to relieve some of his anguish over Johnston&#x27;s death. Glicken and a team of geologists mapped the debris field left over from St. Helens&#x27;s structural collapse, which consisted of roughly a quarter of the mass of the volcano. Through extensive, meticulous analysis, the team traced the origins and the means of movement of each piece of debris, ranging from blocks in width to mere fragments.

With his group, Glicken compiled a landmark study in the field of volcanic landslides, establishing the principle that tall volcanoes have a tendency to collapse. The study garnered praise for its unique conclusions and attention to detail, inspiring volcanologists to identify similar deposit mounds at volcanoes around the world. After the findings from his dissertation were published in several shorter articles throughout the 1980s, Glicken earned recognition as the first geologist to explain the creation of hummock fields near tall volcanoes.

=== Research after St. Helens and death ===
In the years following the eruption, activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO&#x27;s budget and contemplate closing the station. Glicken continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991.
On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at . The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists&#x27; post, killing them upon impact.

In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended in length. Glicken&#x27;s remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents&#x27; wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists known to have been killed by a volcanic eruption.

=== Posthumous report ===
At the time of his death, Glicken had been seeking to publish his doctoral dissertation in one piece, having earlier published elements as shorter articles. He had already defined the criteria for debris avalanches on the slopes of volcanoes, and authored several publications on the subject; Swanson named him one of the foremost experts in the field. After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, research in the niche area grew as more studies identified debris at well-known volcanoes. His work on flows at Mount St. Helens is considered the most complete in the field to date. It was later published in 1996 as a single report by his acquaintances Carol Ostengren, John Costa, Dan Dzurisin, and Jon Major, among others, at the United States Geological Survey. In his preface to Glicken&#x27;s publication, Major comments that &quot;the Mount St. Helens deposit will never be mapped in such detail again.&quot;

Glicken&#x27;s report is titled &quot;Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington&quot;. It comprises his extensive laboratory and field work, supplemented by photographs of the eruption, writings that describe St. Helens before the eruption, and references to previous publications, including Voight&#x27;s work. In the report, Glicken constructed a map of the landslide deposit at a scale of 1:24000, followed by a lithologic map describing rock varieties at a scale of 1:12000. The report also provides a conclusion for the movement of each slide block, using photographs and other data to estimate the velocity of each landslide, describing the composition of each, and recounting the interactions between blocks.

== Tributes and legacy ==
Despite their appreciation of his work, many of Glicken&#x27;s associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One of his friends writes, &quot;Harry was a character his whole life. ... Everyone who knew him was amazed he was such a good scientist.&quot; Regarding Glicken&#x27;s driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as &quot;a cartoon character&quot; who &quot;would drive at full speed down the road, talking about whatever was important to him, and ... come to a four-way stoplight and he&#x27;d sail through it, never knowing he&#x27;d just gone through&quot;.

Glicken&#x27;s father said in 1991 that his son died pursuing his passion, and that he was &quot;totally absorbed&quot; with volcanology. United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken&#x27;s personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, &quot;What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [Glicken] deeply for a very long time, and, in a way, I think it made him even more dedicated than he was before.&quot;

Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that &quot;Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes.&quot; Many studies have utilized Glicken&#x27;s criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken&#x27;s 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken&#x27;s body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as &quot;a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches&quot;.

Glicken was closely connected to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he earned his doctorate and conducted research. To remember his association with the university, each year the Department of Earth Science awards an outstanding graduate geology student the &quot;Harry Glicken Memorial Graduate Fellowship&quot;, established by the Harry Glicken Fund, which aims to support students &quot;who will pursue research relating to the understanding of volcanic processes&quot;.

== Selected publications ==
Most of Glicken&#x27;s published work centers around the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. He also coauthored works with other volcanologists that focused on debris avalanches. Colleague Jon Major writes that &quot;The full scope of Harry&#x27;s work ... has never been published.&quot;

<text>Cate Shortland (born 10 August 1968) is an Australian director and screenwriter. She received international acclaim for her 2004 romantic drama film &quot;Somersault&quot;, her 2012 historical drama film &quot;Lore&quot;, and her 2017 psychological thriller film &quot;Berlin Syndrome&quot;. She is best known for directing the 2021 superhero film &quot;Black Widow&quot;.

==Early life==
Shortland was born in Temora, New South Wales. She graduated from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, where she received the Southern Star Award for most promising student.

==Career==
Shortland has created several award-winning short films: &quot;Strap on Olympia&quot; (1995); &quot;Pentuphouse&quot; (1998); &quot;Flower Girl&quot; (2000); and &quot;Joy&quot; (2000).

She spent three years directing episodes of the Network Ten television series, &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;.

In 2004, Shortland released her debut feature-length film, &quot;Somersault&quot; (2004), which was entered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. She directed the Australian television film &quot;The Silence&quot;.

Her second feature, &quot;Lore&quot;, had its Australian premiere at the 2012 Sydney Film Festival. It won at the Locarno International Film Festival in August 2012 the &quot;Prix du Public UBS&quot;. In November, the film won the Bronze Horse for best film at the Stockholm International Film Festival. The film was selected as the Australian entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.

In 2015, Shortland announced she was working on a third feature film, &quot;Berlin Syndrome&quot;. Based on the book of the same name by Melanie Joosten, the film starred Teresa Palmer as an Australian photojournalist who becomes imprisoned in the apartment of a man with whom she has a one-night stand. The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.

In July 2018, Shortland was announced as the director of the 2021 &quot;Black Widow&quot; film for Marvel Studios.

==Personal life==
Shortland is a convert to Judaism. She married filmmaker Tony Krawitz in 2009, and they have two children.

<doc id="982000" wikidata="Q7601285" url="?curid=982000" title="Star refinement">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in the study of topology and open covers of a topological space &quot;X&quot;, a star refinement is a particular kind of refinement of an open cover of &quot;X&quot;. A related concept is the notion of barycentric refinement.

Star refinements are used in the definition of fully normal space and in one definition of uniform space. It is also useful for stating a characterization of paracompactness.

==Definitions==

The general definition makes sense for arbitrary coverings and does not require a topology. Let formula_1 be a set and let formula_2 be a covering of formula_3 that is, formula_4 Given a subset formula_5 of formula_3 the star of formula_5 with respect to formula_2 is the union of all the sets formula_9 that intersect formula_10 that is,
formula_11

Given a point formula_12 we write formula_13 instead of formula_14

A covering formula_2 of formula_1 is a refinement of a covering formula_17 of formula_1 if every formula_9 is contained in some formula_20 The following are two special kinds of refinement. The covering formula_2 is called a barycentric refinement of formula_17 if for every formula_23 the star formula_13 is contained in some formula_20 The covering formula_2 is called a star refinement of formula_17 if for every formula_9 the star formula_29 is contained in some formula_20

==Properties and Examples==

Every star refinement of a cover is a barycentric refinement of that cover. The converse is not true, but a barycentric refinement of a barycentric refinement is a star refinement.

Given a metric space formula_3 let formula_32 be the collection of all open balls formula_33 of a fixed radius formula_34 The collection formula_35 is a barycentric refinement of formula_36 and the collection formula_37 is a star refinement of formula_38

<doc id="982004" wikidata="Q2981817" url="?curid=982004" title="Coextinction">
<text>Coextinction and cothreatened refer to the phenomenon of the loss or decline of a host species resulting in the loss or endangerment of another species that depends on it, potentially leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. The term was originated by the authors Stork and Lyal (1993) and was originally used to explain the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their specific hosts. The term is now used to describe the loss of any interacting species, including competition with their counterpart, and specialist herbivores with their food source. Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct.

==Causes==
The most frequently cited example is that of the extinct passenger pigeon and its parasitic bird lice &quot;Columbicola extinctus&quot; and &quot;Campanulotes defectus&quot;. Recently, &quot;C. extinctus&quot; was rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon, and &quot;C. defectus&quot; was found to be a likely case of misidentification of the existing &quot;Campanulotes flavus&quot;. However, even though the passenger pigeon louse was rediscovered, coextinctions of other parasites, even on the passenger pigeon, may have occurred. Several louse species, such as &quot;Rallicola extinctus&quot;, a huia parasite, probably became extinct together with their hosts.

Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of species may go extinct in the next 50 years. This is in part due to coextinction; for example the loss of tropical butterfly species from Singapore is attributed to the loss of their specific larval host plants. To predict how possible future cases of coextinction might play out, one set of researchers made models to predict probabilistic relationships between affiliate and host extinctions across co-evolved inter-specific systems. The subjects are pollinating &quot;Ficus&quot; wasps and &quot;Ficus&quot;; primates and their parasites; (Pneumocystis Fungi, Nematode, and Lice) and their hosts; parasitic mites and lice and their avian hosts; butterflies and their larval host plants; and ant butterflies and their host ants. For all but the most host-specific affiliate groups (e.g., primate Pneumocystis fungi and primates), affiliate extinction levels may be modest at low levels of host extinction but can be expected to rise quickly as host extinctions increase to levels predicted in the near future. This curvilinear relationship between host and affiliate extinction levels may also explain, in part, why so few coextinction events have been documented to date.

Investigations have been carried out into coextinction risk among the rich Psyllid fauna Hemiptera – Psylloidea inhabiting acacias (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae: Acacia) in central eastern New South Wales, Australia. The results, suggest that &quot;A. ausfeldii&quot; hosts one specialist psyllid species, Acizzia, and that &quot;A. gordonii&quot; hosts one specialist psyllid, Acizzia. Both psyllid species may be threatened at the same level of their host species with coextinction.

Interaction patterns can be used to anticipate the consequences of phylogenetic effects. By using a system of methodical observations, scientists can use the phylogenetic relationships of species to predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. Consequentially, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree.

In a 2004 paper in &quot;Science&quot;, ecologist Lian Pin Koh and colleagues discuss coextinction, stating

&quot;Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems. The loss of species through coextinction represents the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and coevolutionary history. In view of the global extinction crisis, it is imperative that coextinction be the focus of future research to understand the intricate processes of species extinctions. While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one.&quot; (Koh &quot;et al.&quot; 2004)

Koh &quot;et al.&quot; also define coendangered as taxa &quot;likely to go extinct if their currently endangered hosts [...] become extinct.&quot;

One example is the extinction of many species of the genus &quot;Hibiscadelphus,&quot; as a consequence of the disappearance of several of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, its pollinators. There are also several instances of predators and scavengers dying out or becoming rarer following the disappearance of species which represented their source of food: for example, the coextinction of the Haast&#x27;s eagle with the moa, or the near-extinction of the California condor after the extinctions of its primary food, the dead carcasses of North American Pleistocene megafauna; in the latter, the condor survived by possibly relying on beached marine mammals.

Coextinction may also occur on a local level: for example, the decline in the red ant &quot;Myrmica sabuleti&quot; in southern England, caused by habitat loss, resulted in the extirpation of the large blue butterfly (which is dependent on the ant as a host for its larvae) from Great Britain. In this case the ant avoided extirpation, and the butterfly has since been reintroduced to the island.

Another example of a species that could currently be experiencing coextinction is the rhinoceros stomach bot fly (&quot;Gyrostigma rhinocerontis&quot;) and its host species the endangered black rhinoceros and white rhinoceros (&quot;Diceros bicornis&quot; and &quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;). The fly&#x27;s larvae mature in a rhinoceros&#x27;s stomach lining, having entered the body via the digestive tract, and so are dependent on rhinoceros species to reproduce.

==Consequences==
Coextinction can mean loss of biodiversity and diversification. Coextinction can also result in loss of evolutionary history. 

Coextinction can extend beyond biodiversity and has direct and indirect consequences on the communities of lost species. One main consequence of coextinction that goes beyond biodiversity is mutualism, by loss of food production with a decline in threatened pollinators. Losses of parasites can have negative impacts on humans or the species. 

A consequence of removing specialist parasites from rare hosts is the problem of where the parasites will go once their host is extinct. If the parasites are dependent on only those species than there are parasite species that are at risk of extinction through co-endangerment. 

A study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that extinction of a coral reef-associated fish species of average size would eventually result in the co-extinction of at least ten species of parasites.

== Risks ==
The host specificity and life cycle is a major factor in the risk of coextinction. Species of mutualists, parasites, and many free-living insects that have staged life cycles are more likely to be a victim of coextinction. This is due to the fact that these organisms may depend on multiple hosts throughout their lives in comparison to simple life cycled organisms. Also, if organisms are evolutionary flexible, then these organisms may escape extinction.

The area with that has the greatest effect of coextinction is the tropics. There is a continued disappearance in the habitat, human intervention, and a great loss in vital ecosystem services. This is threatening because the tropics contain 2/3 of the all known species but they aren&#x27;t in a situation where they can be fully taken care of. Along with forest loss other risk factors include: coastal development, overexploitation of wildlife, and habitat conversion, that also affect human well-being.

In an effort to find a stop to coextinction, researchers have found that the first step would be to conserve the host species in which other species are dependent on. These hosts serve as major components for their habitat and need them to survive. In deciding what host to protect, it is important to choose one that can benefit an array of other dependent species.
