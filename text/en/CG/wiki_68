== Etymology ==
During the 160 years of Kakatiya rule between 1163 and 1323 CE, Warangal was referred with various names like &quot;Orugallu&quot;, &quot;Ekashila Nagaram&quot;, or &quot;Omatikonda&quot;; all these mean a &#x27;single stone&#x27;, referring to a huge granite boulder present in the Warangal fort. When the Kakatiya dynasty was defeated by Delhi Sultanate in 1323 CE, ruler Juna Khan, Crown Prince of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, conquered the city and renamed it as Sultanpur. Later Musunuri Nayaks recaptured Warangal in 1336 CE and named it Orugallu again.

== History ==
Warangal was the ancient capital of the Kakatiya dynasty. It was ruled by many kings such as Beta Raja I, Prola Raja I, Beta Raja II, Prola Raja II, Rudradeva, Mahadeva, Ganapathideva, Prataparudra and Rani Rudrama Devi who is the only woman to rule over Telugu region. Beta Raja I is the founder of Kakatiya Dynasty and ruled the kingdom for 30 years and was succeeded by his son Prola Raja I who shifted his capital to Hanamkonda.

During the rule of Ganapathideva, the capital was shifted from Hanamkonda to Warangal. Kakatiya Period Inscriptions praised Warangal as the best city within the Telugu region, up to shores of the ocean. The Kakatiyas left many monuments, including a fortress, four massive stone gateways, the Swayambhu temple dedicated to Shiva, and the Ramappa temple situated near Ramappa Lake. The cultural and administrative distinction of the Kakatiyas was mentioned by Marco Polo. After the defeat of Prataparudra II, the Musunuri Nayaks united 72 Nayak chieftains and captured Warangal from Delhi Sultanate and ruled for fifty years. After the demise of the Nayaks, Warangal was part of the Bahmani Sultanate and then the Sultanate of Golconda.

The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb conquered Golconda in 1687, and it remained part of the Mughal empire until the southern provinces of the empire split away to become the state of Hyderabad in 1724, which included the Telangana region and some parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Hyderabad was annexed to India in 1948, and became an Indian state called Hyderabad state. In 1956, Hyderabad state was partitioned as part of the States Reorganisation Act, and Telangana, the Telugu-speaking region of Hyderabad state, which includes Warangal, became part of Andhra Pradesh. After the Telangana movement, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014, Warangal became a part of Telangana State.

<text>The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is a dedicated training arm of the United Nations system. UNITAR provides training and capacity development activities to assist mainly developing countries with special attention to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and other groups and communities who are most vulnerable, including those in conflict situations.

==Facts==
*Established in 1963
*Close to 133,420 participants per year
*Close to 670 training related activities per year
*Headquarters in Geneva (Switzerland) with offices in New York City (US), Hiroshima (Japan), and Bonn (Germany); project offices in Port Harcourt (Nigeria), and Juba (South Sudan); and UNITAR-UNOSAT Centres in Bangkok (Thailand), and Nairobi (Kenya).
*22 associated training centers (CIFAL)
*About 220 staff and collaborators

==History==

The idea of a United Nations training and research institute was mentioned for the first time in a 1962 resolution of the UN General Assembly. UNITAR was founded in 1963, following the recommendation of the UN Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly, which commissioned the UN Secretary-General with the establishment of a United Nations Institute for Training and Research as an autonomous body within the UN system.

The creation of UNITAR coincided with the addition of 36 States since 1960, including 28 African States to the United Nations. That unprecedented wave of decolonization created a critical need for assistance, as many of the newly independent States lacked the capacity to train their young diplomats. Shaped by its first four Executive Directors originally from newly independent African States, the Institute&#x27;s vision of training was developed considering the very needs and priorities of recipient countries.

UNITAR commenced functioning in March 1965. The Institute originally had its headquarters based in New York City. In 1993, UNITAR&#x27;s headquarters were transferred to Geneva (Switzerland).

==UNITAR today==

The Institute provides training and learning services to national and local government officials of UN member states and civil society representatives from around the world. UNITAR strives to respond to the growing demand from UN member States, especially the Least Developed Countries, for capacity development in the thematic areas of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

UNITAR helps governments to understand climate change, chemicals and waste management, and green economy. The institute also assists ministries of finance through its courses on public debt management, finance and trade, and it provides government officials with training in Peacekeeping and conflict prevention. Through the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT), the Institute supports United Nations funds, programmes, specialized agencies and Member States with satellite imagery analysis over their respective territories, and provide training and capacity development in the use of geospatial information technologies.

Since 2003, UNITAR provides courses to support municipal and regional leaders dealing with complex public policies.

Another task of the institute is to organize knowledge sharing events for the UN Secretary-General, including the annual seminar for Special Representatives of the UN Secretary-General as well as strategic meetings for UN Departments. UNITAR also spearheads UN inter-agency initiatives such as the one UN Learning Platform on Climate Change or the Global Migration Group.

UNITAR&#x27;s research activities are focusing on knowledge systems and their practical applications. They support the Institute&#x27;s training activities through the provision of learning environments adapted to respond to the needs of adult learners, thus facilitating the increase, efficiency and outreach of the Institute&#x27;s capacity development activities.

==Governance==
Operated as an autonomous body within the United Nations system, UNITAR is headed by an Executive Director and governed by a board of trustees. The Executive Director and the members of the board of trustees are appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General.

UNITAR Executive Directors:
==Funding==

UNITAR is a project-based organization and does not receive any funds from the regular United Nations budget. The institute is financed entirely from voluntary contributions mainly from UN Member States, other UN agencies, international and Intergovernmental organization, NGOs and the private sector.

== Offices ==
Headquarters are based in Geneva (Switzerland), complemented with three out posted offices in New York City (US) Hiroshima (Japan), and Bonn (Germany); two project offices in Port Harcourt (Nigeria), and Juba (South Sudan); and two UNITAR-UNOSAT Centres in Bangkok (Thailand), and Nairobi (Kenya).

UNITAR also delivers training through its CIFAL Global Network (&quot;Centre International de Formation des Autorités et Leaders&quot;) composed of 22 international, associated training centers. These CIFAL centers are located across Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean.

== Areas of Work ==

UNITAR has training expertise in multilateral diplomacy, conflict prevention and peacemaking, peacekeeping, adaptation to climate change, green economy, environmental governance, chemicals and waste management, local governance, as well as public finance and trade, and supporting coherence for the 2030 Agenda amongst others. UNITAR also serves as a research centre for application of satellite imagery to humanitarian, conflict or disaster situations, through UNOSAT, the United Nations Satellite Centre.

The work of the institute is organized under five pillars:
* Promote peace and just and inclusive societies &quot;(Peace)&quot;
* Prosperity through sustainable economic growth &quot;(Prosperity)&quot;
* People and social inclusion &quot;(People)&quot;
* Planet, environmental protection and restoration, and climate change &quot;(Planet)&quot;
* Optimizing the use of technology and supporting coherence for the 2030 Agenda (&quot;Cross-fertilizing knowledge and expertise)&quot;

<text>Tetsu Yano (Japanese 矢野徹 &quot;Yano Tetsu&quot;; October 5, 1923 – October 13, 2004) was a Japanese science fiction translator and writer. He began to introduce to Japanese readers the works of US science fiction writers in the late 1940s. He was the first Japanese writer of the genre to visit the United States, in 1953. He took part in founding Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan (SFWJ, 日本SF作家クラブ) in 1963, and served as its president from 1978 to 1979.

== Biography ==
Yano was born in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture and grew up in Kobe. After studying at Chuo University for three years, he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army, serving two years and two months. After the war he made a living collecting trash on a US military base, where he became fascinated with the colorfully illustrated science fiction works thrown away by the soldiers.

He learned to read English and eventually began translating science fiction. The works of Robert A. Heinlein, Frederik Pohl, Desmond Bagley, and Frank Herbert were among the some 360 translations by him. He also wrote stories of his own, including &quot;The Legend of the Paper Spaceship&quot;, which first appeared in English translation in 1984 and has appeared in several collections. Some of his stories have been adapted into anime.

Yano died on October 13, 2004, from cancer of the large intestine. Although he made a partial recovery after an operation in November of the previous year, he relapsed. His funeral was held on October 16, 2004. The SFWJ gave the Special Award of Nihon SF Taisho Award for his contributions to Japanese science fiction.

<doc id="995253" wikidata="Q526273" url="?curid=995253" title="Andy Irons">
<text>Philip Andrew Irons (July 24, 1978November 2, 2010) was an American professional surfer. Irons began surfing with his brother Bruce on the shallow and dangerous waves of Kauai, Hawaii, before being spotted by a local surfboard brand and flown to North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii, to compete and develop his skill. 

Over the course of his professional career, he won three world titles (2002, 2003, 2004), three Quiksilver Pro France titles (2003, 2004, 2005), two Rip Curl Pro Search titles (2006 and 2007), and 20 elite-tour victories, including the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing four times from 2002 to 2006. He won at nearly every venue on the ASP calendar, only missing Gold Coast, Brazil, and Portugal.

== Career ==
His younger brother Bruce Irons is a former competitor on the World Championship Tour of Surfing. During his childhood, Andy regularly lost to Bruce in contests, but that changed once he entered the World Championship Tour. During his professional career, he won three world titles (2002, 2003, 2004), three Quiksilver Pro France titles (2003, 2004, 2005), two Rip Curl Pro Search titles (2006 and 2007) and 20 elite-tour victories, including the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing four times from 2002 to 2006. On September 3, 2010, he won the Billabong Pro Teahupoo in Tahiti.

In 2009, Irons withdrew from doing the full ASP World Tour season for personal reasons, though he did participate in a few events. He requested a wildcard entry for the 2010 ASP World Tour season, which was granted by ASP President Wayne Bartholomew. As a result, Irons did not have to re-qualify in 2010 via the World Qualifying Series (WQS). Irons won the Billabong Pro Tahiti 2010.

He was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California, in 2008. The Governor of Hawaii declared February 13 forever &quot;Andy Irons Day&quot;.

Billabong produced an Andy Irons line of board shorts.

==Death==
Irons died on November 2, 2010. He was found by two hotel staff lying in bed on his back with the sheets pulled up to his chin after he had failed to respond to knocks on the door and they went in to investigate.

The Tarrant County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office concludes that Irons died from a cardiac arrest due to a severe blockage of a main artery of the heart. The official autopsy report lists also a second cause of death as &quot;acute mixed drug ingestion&quot;, listing alprazolam, methadone, benzoylecgonine (a metabolite of cocaine), and traces of methamphetamine as the drugs found in Andy&#x27;s body at the time of his death. Initial press releases cited Dengue fever as the cause of Irons&#x27;s death; however, the autopsy report conducted by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner&#x27;s office were negative for Dengue and other flavivirus. It is unclear why rumors that Dengue fever contributed to Irons&#x27;s death proliferated.

In response to Irons&#x27;s death, a World Championship Tour event in Puerto Rico was postponed for two days with competitors holding a &quot;paddle out&quot; memorial service for Irons. Irons had withdrawn from the event citing ill health and was flying back to his home in Hawaii during a stopover in Grapevine, Texas, near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He had reportedly stopped in Miami after leaving Puerto Rico, and early reports said he was put on a saline drip. He was reported to have been vomiting on the Hawaii-bound plane before being removed prior to takeoff. In the days immediately following his death, it was reported that in Dallas, an extremely ill Irons had attempted to board his connecting flight to Honolulu at 11:30 a.m. but was turned away at an American Airlines gate—a claim the company denies.

A memorial service was held November 14, 2010, in Hanalei Bay, Kauai. His wife, Lyndie, and brother, Bruce, scattered his ashes outside Hanalei Bay, where thousands of family, friends, and admirers said their last goodbyes.

Friend and rival surfer Kelly Slater dedicated his November 6, 2010, victory to Irons. &quot;I just want to send my condolences to Andy&#x27;s family,&quot; Slater said:
: &quot;I&#x27;m a little overwhelmed right now, but I want to dedicate this to Andy ... It&#x27;s like exact opposites. This doesn&#x27;t really offset that, I&#x27;d give this title away in a second if Andy could come back.&quot;
Slater also wrote a candid remembrance honoring the life of Andy Irons on the anniversary of his death; it was also the same day that Slater claimed his 11th ASP World Title in San Francisco.

== Personal life ==
Irons married Lyndie Dupuis on November 25, 2007, in Princeville, Kauai. She was seven months pregnant with their first child at the time of his death. Lyndie gave birth to their son, Andy Axel Irons, in Kauai on the opening day of the Pipeline Masters in Memory of Andy Irons on December 8, 2010. Lyndie and Axel continue to live on Kauai, where she and Andy shared a home.

==Films==
The 2018 movie &quot;Andy Irons: Kissed by God&quot; (directed by adventure-sport documentarians Steve and Todd Jones) is about the three-time world champion who died at 32 after a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder and addiction. The film features in-depth interviews with Andy&#x27;s brother Bruce Irons, his wife Lyndie Irons, Joel Parkinson, Nathan Fletcher, Sunny Garcia, and Kelly Slater.

In 2009, Irons Brothers Productions released &quot;A fly in the champagne&quot;, a documentary of the rivalry that arose between Irons and Slater in the early 2000s. The movie ends with a trip to Indonesia Kelly Slater and Andy Irons went on together.

The 2005 movie &quot;Blue Horizon&quot; (directed by surfing filmmaker Jack McCoy) paralleled his life on the WCT tour with that of free surfer David Rastovich. The film also touched on his long-time rivalry with 11-time world champion Kelly Slater. Although the film was created in a documentary-like style, there has been some debate over whether or not the film offered an accurate and fair portrayal of Irons&#x27;s surfing lifestyle. 

In addition to &quot;Blue Horizon&quot;, Irons was also a subject of many other surf films, including his screen appearance in &quot;Trilogy&quot;, which starred himself, Joel Parkinson, and Taj Burrow.

==Rivalry with Kelly Slater==

Irons had a much-publicized, and, according to him, overhyped, rivalry with fellow professional surfer Kelly Slater. In an interview, Irons said:
For me, just being affiliated with Kelly--to be next to him--I mean, that&#x27;s awesome. He&#x27;s the ultimate surfer. He&#x27;s the best surfer in the world. Ever. Best competitive, best free surfer, you name it, and to have my name put next to his everywhere really is flattering. He&#x27;s the Michael Jordan of our sport. Kelly knows how I feel about him. Despite all the media hype that comes out of a rivalry there&#x27;s a lot of respect given both ways. People don&#x27;t realize there are times when we hang out. We&#x27;ll go check the waves together. We talk about boards. He invited me personally to his contest on Tavarua. There&#x27;s a ton of respect there.

Slater himself was quoted in a &quot;Surfer Magazine&quot; tribute for Irons:
Andy was an absolutely gifted individual. I’m lucky to have known him and had the times we had together. I feel blessed that we worked through the differences we had and I was able to learn what I’m made of because of Andy. I got to know a happy, funny, innocent kid who was happy to live every second with the people he loved. I’m so sad. My thoughts are with Bruce and Lyndie and their parents and all of his many friends around the world. It’s a huge and far too premature loss for all of us. He was the most intense competitor I’ve ever known and one of the most sensitive people. He had so much life left in him and it hurts to think about. We look forward to his memory living on with our memories of him and his child on the way. There are a lot of uncles awaiting his arrival. I really miss Andy. He had a really good heart.

== Legacy ==
A 2018 documentary titled &quot;Andy Irons: Kissed by God&quot; chronicled Irons&#x27;s surfing career and his struggles with bipolar disorder and substance abuse.

Irons&#x27;s family runs the Andy Irons Foundation in his memory which focuses on community programs for youth struggling with mental illness. In 2019, Metallica and Billabong released the &quot;Metallica x AI Forever&quot; collection, with a portion of the proceeds benefiting the Andy Irons Foundation. Irons had previously collaborated with Metallica and Billabong for a clothing collection in 2007.

<text>Hugh Milburn Stone (July 5, 1904 – June 12, 1980) was an American actor, best known for his role as &quot;Doc&quot; (Dr. Galen Adams) on the Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

==Early life==
Stone was born in Burrton, Kansas, to Herbert Stone and the former Laura Belfield. There, he graduated from Burrton High School, where he was active in the drama club, played basketball, and sang in a barbershop quartet. Stone&#x27;s brother, Joe Stone, says their uncle Fred Stone, was a versatile actor who appeared on Broadway and in circuses).

Although Stone had a congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he turned it down, choosing instead to become an actor with a stock theater company headed by Helen Ross.
Hugh Stone was born in Burton, Ks. Joseph Wakefield Myers, MD was the town Doctor from 1913 to 1928. Hugh was known to have said he styled his portrayal of a country Dr. based on Dr. Myers.

==Career==

In 1919, Stone debuted on stage in a Kansas tent show. He ventured into vaudeville in the late 1920s, and in 1930, he was half of the Stone and Strain song-and-dance act. His Broadway credits include &quot;Around the Corner&quot; (1936) and &quot;Jayhawker&quot; (1934).

In the 1930s, Stone came to Los Angeles, California, to launch his own screen career. He was featured in the &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; adventure serial for Monogram Pictures. In 1939 he played Stephen Douglass in the movie &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; with Henry Fonda and Ward Bond. In 1939 he appeared in &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; as head busboy (uncredited). In 1940, he appeared with Marjorie Reynolds, Tristram Coffin, and I. Stanford Jolley in the comedy espionage film &quot;Chasing Trouble&quot;. That same year, he co-starred with Roy Rogers in the film &quot;Colorado&quot; in the role of Rogers&#x27; brother-gone-wrong.

Stone appeared uncredited in the 1939 film &quot;Blackwell&#x27;s Island&quot;. Stone played Dr. Blake in the 1943 film &quot;Gung Ho!&quot; and a liberal-minded warden in Monogram Pictures&#x27; &quot;Prison Mutiny&quot; also in 1943. Signed by Universal Pictures in 1943, in the films &quot;Captive Wild Woman&quot; (1943), &quot;Jungle Woman&quot; (1943), &quot;Sherlock Holmes Faces Death&quot; [Captain Pat Vickery], (1944), he became a familiar face in its features and serials, starring as hero Jim Hudson in &quot;The Great Alaskan Mystery&quot; (1944). In 1944, he portrayed a Ration Board representative in the Universal-produced public service film &quot;Prices Unlimited&quot; for the U.S. Office of Price Administration and the Office of War Information. One of his film roles was a radio columnist in the Gloria Jean-Kirby Grant musical &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot;. He made such an impression in this film that Universal Studios gave him a starring role (and a similar characterization) in the 1945 serial &quot;The Master Key&quot;. The same year, he was featured in the Inner Sanctum murder mystery &quot;The Frozen Ghost&quot;. In 1953, Stone appeared as Charlton Heston&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;Arrowhead&quot;, a Western also featuring Brian Keith and Katy Jurado.
In 1955, one of CBS Radio&#x27;s hit series, the Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, was adapted for television and recast with different actors for various reasons (William Conrad was judged too obese to play Matt Dillon on camera, Georgia Ellis wasn&#x27;t viewed as quite telegenic enough to portray Kitty on television, etc.). Howard McNear, the radio Doc Adams (who later played Floyd the barber on television&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;), was replaced by Stone, who gave the role a harder edge consistent with his screen portrayals. He stayed with &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; through its entire television run, with the exception of 7 episodes in 1971, when Stone required heart surgery and Pat Hingle replaced him as Dr. Chapman. Stone appeared in 604 episodes through 1975, often shown sparring in a friendly manner with co-stars Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, who played, respectively, Chester Goode and Festus Haggen.

==Personal life==
Stone&#x27;s brother, Joe, was a writer who was the author of scripts for three episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

Stone was a cousin of the character actress Madge Blake. 

In March 1971, Stone had heart bypass surgery at UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. In June 1980, Stone died of a heart attack in La Jolla. He was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego. 

Stone had a surviving daughter, Shirley Stone Gleason (born &quot;circa&quot; 1926) of Costa Mesa, California, from his first marriage of 12 years to Ellen Morrison, formerly of Delphos, Kansas, who died in 1937. 
His second wife, the former Jane Garrison, a native of Hutchinson, Kansas, died in 2002. Stone had married, divorced, and remarried Garrison.

==Legacy==

In 1968, Stone received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama for his work on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.
In 1975, Stone received an honorary doctorate from St. Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kansas, where &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; was set but not filmed.

For his contribution to the television industry, Milburn Stone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1981, Stone was inducted posthumously into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. After his death, he left a legacy for the performing arts in Cecil County in northeastern Maryland, by way of the Milburn Stone Theatre in North East, Maryland.

<text>David Ossman (born December 6, 1936, in Santa Monica) is an American writer and comedian, best known as a member of the Firesign Theatre and screenwriter of such films as &quot;Zachariah&quot;.

==Early life==
Ossman attended Pomona College, where he starred in productions including &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;Fumed Oak&quot;. He transferred to Columbia University.

==Career==
Ossman&#x27;s roles during his Firesign years include George Leroy (&quot;Peorgie&quot;) Tirebiter on &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot; and Catherwood in the &quot;Nick Danger&quot; series.

In 1973, he recorded the solo album &quot;How Time Flys&quot;. During the 1980s, he left the Firesign Theatre, primarily to produce programs for National Public Radio.

During the 1990s Ossman and his wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media, through which they produced audio theatre for children, as well as a series of major star-studded audio theatre broadcasts for NPR, including &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot; (1991), &quot;Empire of the Air&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds 50th Anniversary Production&quot;, &quot;Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Goldfish&quot;, and the 100th Anniversary audio theatre adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

His latest Otherworld Media Productions include &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, and &quot;A Taffetas Christmas&quot;. These performances are held at Whidbey Children&#x27;s Theater on Whidbey Island, a local theatre where children can come to do plays and workshops.

Otherworld Media has also taken on the task of adapting and producing half a dozen screenplays in live radio play format in 2007 and 2008 at the International Mystery Writers Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky. Ossman personally wrote the adaptation and directed the 2007 Angie Award winner Albatross (original screenplay written by Lance Rucker and Timothy Perrin).

Ossman has written a mystery novel, &quot;The Ronald Reagan Murder Case: A George Tirebiter Mystery&quot; (published by BearManor Media, 2007). In 2008, Bear Manor Media published his memoir, &quot;Dr. Firesign&#x27;s Follies: Radio, Comedy, Mystery, History.&quot;

Stage versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;; &quot;The Further Adventures of Nick Danger, Third Eye&quot;; and &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot; and &quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot; are published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc.

Ossman also wrote a book of poetry in 2009 titled &quot;Fools &amp; Death&quot; (published by Ion Drive Publishing, 2009).

His &quot;Old Cart Wrangler&#x27;s Saga&quot; was a finalist for a 2019 Audie Award (APA- Audiobook Publishers Association) in the Original Works category. It was published by Blackstone Publishing in Ashland, OR.

==Personal life==
On March 19, 2008, Mount Rainier National Park rangers found the body of Ossman&#x27;s oldest son, Devin, less than two miles from the trailhead where he had parked his car two days earlier for a day hike. His wife had reported him missing the day before.

Ossman also has a daughter, Alizon.

He currently resides on Whidbey Island with his wife.

Ossman was a member of the Church of the SubGenius.

<doc id="995294" wikidata="Q4435645" url="?curid=995294" title="List of ships of the line of the Dutch Republic">
<text>This is a list of Dutch (the [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]]) [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], or sailing warships which formed the Dutch battlefleet. It covers ships built from about 1623 (there are few reliable records of individual earlier warships) until the creation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in March 1815, including the period of the French-controlled Batavian Republic, nominal Kingdom of Holland and direct French annexation between 1795 and 1813. It excludes frigates and lesser warships.

The Dutch were often handicapped by the smaller size of their ships relative to the vessels of other nations, particularly those of England and France. This was partly due to the shallow home waters of the Netherlands, which limited the maximum draft with which ships could operate. Consequently, the Dutch did not build large three-deckers such as were found in the navies of England and France, except for a brief period from 1682 to 1695 (and a very few much later on during the Napoleonic era). However, during the period up to 1650 the Dutch made up in sheer quantity of ships for what they lacked in terms of the size of vessels; the list below is incomplete and does not include some of the many hundreds of Dutch warships belonging to the United Provinces between 1579 (when the Netherlands effectively became independent from Spanish control) and 1795 (in which latter year the French invaded and established the puppet state of the Batavian Republic).

==The Five Admiralties==
Administratively and politically, until 1795 there was not a single Dutch Navy but five distinct Admiralties. In the south was the Admiralty of Zeeland covering the Province of Zeeland (indicated by &quot;(Z)&quot; preceding a ship&#x27;s name in the list below). Next were three covering the Province of Holland - the Admiralty of the Maas (or &quot;Maze&quot;) in the south of Holland, centred on Rotterdam (indicated by &quot;(M)&quot;), the Admiralty of Amsterdam in the centre of the Province (indicated by &quot;(A)&quot;), and the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier in the north of Holland (indicated by &quot;(N)&quot;). The fifth was the Admiralty of Friesland covering the Province of Friesland (indicated by &quot;(F)&quot;), albeit with fewer ships than the other four Admiralties. Each Dutch warship belonged exclusively to one or other of the five Admiralties, although in the 17th century the Dutch fleet included many ships of mercantile ownership, particularly those belonging to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The names of Dutch warships were often common to several Admiralties, so that there were vessels bearing the same name in different Admiralties at the same time.

Armament was often changed, so the number of guns mounted in any ship frequently varied from year to year. During the 1650 - 1680 period, many Dutch ships of the line were &quot;up-gunned&quot;, ending with significantly more guns (or guns of larger calibres) than when they first came into service.

==The Dutch Rating System==
Prior to 1632, the Dutch did not have a system of categorising vessels beyond a simple functional division into &quot;ships&quot;, &quot;frigates&quot; and lesser ship-rigged &quot;three-mast yachts&quot;. On 11 March 1632, the Dutch government approved three standard designs (which they termed &quot;charters&quot;) to which all new warships should be built. These set the requirement for low-built ships without castles, an uninterrupted deck, slim hulls and light construction; the three designs were of 100 (Amsterdam) feet, 120 feet and 128 feet length (measured on the uppermost continuous deck) respectively, and future charter divisions retained this classification by length rather than by tonnage or number of guns (as used by England and France). However, later in the 17th century, the Dutch moved towards using a Rating system similar (but not identical) to the English or French system, while retaining the terminology of &quot;Charters&quot; well into the 18th century. To provide flagships for the battlefleet, two two-decked ships were built in this period, both at Rotterdam for the Admiralty of the Maas - the &quot;Aemilia&quot; of 1632 and the &quot;Brederode&quot; of 1644; each was 144 (Amsterdam) feet in length and 35 feet in breadth.

The system coincided with the English categories of 1st to 4th Rates, i.e. they comprised the battlefleet units. In 1652 the Dutch - under pressure from their naval commander Maarten Tromp to build larger ships to combat the English - revised this rating system which was still based on a series of &quot;Charters&quot;, initially grading the battlefleet units by length of ship with classes of 130 (Amsterdam) feet, 136 feet and 140 feet; this was at a time when the largest ship in the Dutch navies measured 134 feet in length. Subsequently, having won the Battle of Dungeness in November 1652, Tromp persuaded the Staten-Generaal to add a further class of 150 feet ships as the &quot;1st Charter&quot;, although only two of this length were built initially - the &quot;Eendracht&quot; and &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;, both launched at Rotterdam for the Admiralty of the Maas in 1653 and 1654 respectively with 58 guns each.

Between 1652 and 1680 the &quot;Charters&quot; underwent drastic revision, but it was still more appropriate to classify ships of the line during this era by their (gundeck) length than by the number of guns carried. The lengths remained the basis of the Charters. By 1680, following the end of the later Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Staten-Generaal divided the warships of the five Admiralties into eight &quot;charters&quot;. The first four charters comprised the battlefleet, while the next three (5th to 7th Charters) covered frigates down to 20 guns, and the 8th Charter included smaller cruising warships. 

The 1st Charter comprised the largest two-deckers before 1680, together with &#x27;partial&#x27; three-deckers (i.e. ships with only a partial battery on the third deck, without any guns in the waist), then subsequently covered the full three-deckers (for which see note below). These were ships carrying more than 70 guns, although this had risen to about 80 guns by 1670 and by 1680 to encompass ships of 90 guns or more. They generally (but not always) carried a mix of 36-pounder and 24-pounder guns on their primary (lower) gun deck, with lighter cannon (18-pounders and 12-pounders) on the upper deck and 6-pounders on their quarterdecks.

The other battlefleet Charters were all two-decked warships. By the 1670s the 2nd Charter were all two-decker warships with a number of guns initially around 60 to 74, although by 1680 the 60-gun and 64-gun ships had been relegated to the 3rd Charter. They usually carried 18-pounders (or a mixture of 24-pounders and 18-pounders) on the lower deck. The 3rd and 4th Charter ships usually carried 18-pounders or 12-pounders as their main battery. The 4th Charter ships by 1680 carried between 44 and 56 guns; by 1714 a minimum of 50 guns applied.

==Dimensions==
All lengths quoted in this article are measured in Amsterdam feet, taken as the length of the uppermost continuous deck from stem to stern. The Amsterdam foot (&quot;Amsterdamse voet&quot;) was equivalent to 28.3133 cm, and thus equated to 0.9289 of an English foot, a factor to bear in mind in any comparisons. It was divided into eleven inches (&quot;Amsterdamse duim&quot;) equal to 2.57393 cm, compared with 2.54 cm for an English inch. Thus 150 Amsterdam feet equated to 139 ft 4 inches in English measurement. The Rotterdam foot was considerably longer - 31.39 cm (equal to almost 1.03 English feet) - and was divided into twelve inches, each of 2.615 cm. However in 1653 all the Admiralties adopted the Amsterdam foot, and this has been employed throughout this article except where otherwise stated.

==Tons==
The system of weights was similarly united in the Netherlands, with the Amsterdam pound (&quot;pond&quot;) equal to 494.1 grams, compared with the English pound of 453.6 grams. Thus the Amsterdam pound (in which all ordnance calibres are quoted below) was 8.93% greater than the English pound (e.g the Dutch &quot;24-pounder&quot; was equivalent to 26 lb 2.3 oz.

==Three-deckers==
Most of the Dutch ships of the line, for reasons given above, were built with two decks of guns. However, in the 1660s four ships of the Amsterdam Admiralty were built which were structurally three-deckers (the &quot;Spiegel&quot; of 1663, followed by the &quot;Gouden Leeuw&quot;, &quot;Witte Olifant&quot; and &quot;Dolphijn&quot; of 1666), but these had only partially-armed upper decks, with guns mounted forwards and aft (under the quarterdeck) but not in the waist at this level. From 1682 twenty complete three-deckers were built, the last in 1721; these comprised the 1st Charter issued on 15 February 1680, and provided for these to have dimensions of 170 (Amsterdam) feet on the gundeck (146 ft 3 in on the keel) x 43 feet x 16 ft. After these twenty, no further 1st Charter ships were built by the Netherlands.

== Ships of the &quot;Old Navy&quot; (1579 to 1648) ==
This is the period during which the Dutch provinces consolidated their independence from Spanish rule, forming the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and took part in the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Almost all of these ships were relatively small, with only a single gun deck, and were owned by the five Admiralties. The majority were between 120 and 130 feet in length as measured on the upper deck, the exceptions being the fleet flagships built in 1632 and 1644, which are separately listed below; the warships built for the Admiralties were supplemented frequently by ships hired from the VOC (East India Company, established 1602), WIC (West India Company, established 1621) or other mercantile source (this was particularly true in 1652, at the outbreak of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War), but only a few of these are mentioned.

=== Fleet flagships ===
The &quot;Aemilia&quot; and &quot;Brederode&quot;, although entering service 12 years apart, had identical dimensions of 144 ft x 35 ft 3 in x 14 ft 2 in, in Amsterdam feet (equating to 132 ft x 32 ft x 13 ft 6 in in Rotterdam feet). Both were built for the Maas Admiralty in the naval shipyard at Rotterdam by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel. Each was a two-decked ship, with 13 pairs of gunports on the lower tier in &quot;Aemilia&quot; and 12 pairs in &quot;Brederode&quot;. Although no dimensions are known for the &quot;Maagd van Dordrecht&quot;, she was quoted as being 300 &quot;lasts&quot; (the same as &quot;Aemilia&quot;) so was probably of similar size.
* (M) &quot;Aemilia&quot;. 46 guns (built 1632, 300 &quot;lasts&quot;). Carried (in 1642) 4 × 36-pdrs; 11 × 24-pdrs; 33 × 12-pdrs; 9 × 6-pdrs; crewed (1635) by 160 sailors and 30 soldiers. She served as Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of the Downs in 1639 (by then with 57 guns); sold to France 1643 as a privateer, captured by Spain and broken up 1647.

== Ships of the &quot;New Navy&quot; (1650 to 1682) ==
This is the period during which the United Provinces fought three Anglo-Dutch Wars – conflicts of 1652-1656, 1665-1667 and 1672-1674; although England withdrew from this contest in 1674, the Dutch remained at war against the French until 1678. The Charter (rating) system was introduced in 1652 - initially defined by ships&#x27; lengths - but was radically revised during this era (see notes above).

At the start of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch navies relied heavily on hired ships to expand their fleet, but a programme to build thirty new ships of the line was promptly started. This comprised a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the &quot;Eendracht&quot; of 1653), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more. It was followed within a year by a second thirty-ship programme, again consisting of a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot; of 1654), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more.

=== 1st Charter ===
The first two of these were launched for the Maas Admiralty in 1653 and 1654. While structurally three-deckers, on these two ships the upper deck was only armed forward (under the forecastle) and aft (under the quarterdeck), with no guns in the waist (this system was also common to other navies in the mid 17th century). Each measured 150 × 38 × 15 Amsterdam feet, and was initially armed with 58 guns. The first ship was originally intended to be named &quot;Prins Willem&quot;, but Willem himself ruled that it should bear the name &quot;Eendracht&quot; (&quot;Concord&quot;) to honour the relationship between the seven provinces which constituted the United Netherlands.
* (M) &quot;Eendracht&quot; 58 guns originally, 72 by 1665 (1653). Designed by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel, built at Dordrecht - sunk (by magazine explosion) at Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665
* (M) &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot; (or simply &quot;Holland&quot;) 58 guns originally (1654). Designed by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel, built at Dordrecht - sold in 1687

=== Other ships of 130 feet or more ===
====Built 1648-1652====
* (A) &quot;Jaarsveld&quot;. 44 guns (1648), 130 ft x 32 ft x 13 ft – flagship of Johan van Galen at the Battle of Montecristo (September 1652); wrecked 9 February 1653 on a rock when leaving Livorno.
* (A) &quot;Vrede&quot;. 44 guns (1650) 131 ft x 32 ft x 13 ft - the precursor of the numerous 130-ft ships built in the First Anglo-Dutch War building programme; she took part in the Battles of Dover (June 1652), Dungeness (Dec 1652), Portland (Feb/March 1653) and the Gabbard (June 1653), all under Gideon de Wildt; later she took part in the Battle of Lowestoft (May 1665) under Hendrik Gotskens, and was broken up 1667.
* (A) &quot;Vrijheid&quot;. 46 guns (1651), 134 ft x 34 ft x 13.25 ft – the largest ship built for the Admiralty of Amsterdam since the early part of the 17th Century. she took part in the Battle of Portland (Feb/March 1653) and was Vice-Adm Witte de With&#x27;s flagship in the Battle of Scheveningen (Aug 1653); she blew up and sank in action at the Battle of Palermo on 2 June 1676.
* (A) &quot;Huis van Nassau&quot;. 36 guns (1651). Formerly the Portuguese &quot;Sao Bartholemeu&quot;, captured in 1651. Sold 18 August 1651.
* (F) &quot;Groenwald&quot;. 44 guns (1652), 132 ft x 31 ft. Deleted 1655.
====The 1653 Programme====
The Dutch had learnt by late 1652, following their defeats in the first year of the Anglo-Dutch War, that a haphazard collection of warships and armed merchantmen could not prevail against a professional naval force. In October 1652 discussions began with a view to producing specially-designed warships. In February 1653 the States-General authorised the building of thirty new warships, financed by two million guilders. Tromp&#x27;s plea that these should all be as big as or bigger than the equivalent English ships was ignored, but the programme was completed in 1653, comprising the flagship &quot;Eendracht&quot; (1st Charter, 150 ft in length) and 29 lesser ships.
* (M) &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot; 44 guns (130 ft). Built by Jacon Hermanszoon Wittert. Last mention in 1656 for expedition to Danzig, under command of Aert van Nes.

* (N) &quot;Wapen van Holland&quot; 50 guns (134 ft)
* (N) &quot;Jozua&quot; 50 guns (136 ft)
* Seven ships were built for the Admiralty of Zeeland, two each in Middelburg, Veere and Zaandam, and one in Vlissingen.
** (Z) &quot;Dordrecht&quot;. 46 guns (Middelburg, 1653) 130 ft x 34 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1673.
** (Z) &quot;Middelburg&quot;. 46 guns (Middelburg, 1653) 130 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1693.
** (Z) &quot;Veere&quot; (also called &quot;Ter Veere&quot;, or &quot;Wapen van Ter Veere&quot;, or &quot;Kampveere&quot;). 44 guns (Veere, 1653) 130 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Captured by the English in 1673, and renamed &quot;Arms of Terver&quot;.

** (Z) &quot;Utrecht&quot;. ? guns (Zaandam, 1653) 134 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1673.
* Ten ships were built for the Admiralty of Amsterdam, all in that port.
** (A) &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. (140 ft)
** (A) &quot;Burcht van Leiden&quot;. (132 ft)
** (A) &quot;Landman&quot;. (130 ft)
** (A) &quot;Maarseveen&quot; (or &quot;Huis te Maarseveen&quot;) (130 ft)

Armaments were significantly increased over the lifetimes of these ships. As an example, the Zeeland ships of 130 (Amsterdam) feet in length were designed to each carry 44 guns - comprising four bronze 24-pounders, ten iron 18-pounders and four bronze 12-pounder on the lower deck; eight iron 12-pounders and ten iron 8-pounders on the upper deck; and eight bronze 6-pounders on the quarterdeck; but all ended up carrying a heavier armament or up to 50 guns or even more.
====The 1654 Programme====
A second set of thirty warships was ordered in 1653 by the States-General, again comprising a flagship (the &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;, similar to the &quot;Eendracht&quot;) and 29 smaller ships. In January 1654 the States-General decreed that, since it - rather than the provincial Admiralties - had financed these programmes, all sixty ships would be considered national property, so that the Admiralties were unable to sell them off at the conclusion of hostilities, as had been the practice in the past.

With the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Staten-Generaal ordered the construction of twenty-four large ships, with a second group of twenty-four being added soon after. This programme, which was all built in the period 1664 to 1667, included ten ships of 160 (Amsterdam) feet length or more, now forming the 1st Charter.

== Ships of the &quot;Expanded Navy&quot; (1682 to 1714) ==
This is the period during which the United Provinces fought in alliance with the English Navy against the French fleet of Louis XIV. By the start of the 1680s, the ships of the 1660s were wearing out, and in 1682 a programme of 36 new ships was authorised by the Staten-Generaal. In 1685 a long-term plan for a battlefleet of 96 ships was agreed in principle (to comprise 20 of the 1st Charter, 28 of the 2nd, 24 of the 3rd and 24 of the 4th), although this target was never fully achieved.

=== 1st Charter ===
These were all three-deckers, with standard dimensions (all in Amsterdam feet) of 170 ft on the upper deck, 146¼ ft on the keel, 43 ft in breadth and 16 ft depth in hold. In later ships this standard was stretched to a greater length.

== Ships of the Dutch Navies 1771 to 1795 ==
In the period of higher international tension, culminating in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, a massive effort to renew the Dutch navies was undertaken. No three-deckers were built, hence no &quot;1st Charter&quot; is listed. This period continues until the French occupation of December 1794 to February 1795, following which the five separate Admiralties were replaced on 27 February 1795 by a single committee dealing with all navy affairs. The list below is continued beyond 1795 to include other ships originally ordered for the United Netherlands but subsequently brought into service for the (French dominated) Batavian Republic.

=== 2nd Charter ===

==Dutch Warships of the Batavian and French-controlled Period (1795-1815)==
While these 20 years are here treated together, they actually comprise four distinct political eras:
&lt;br&gt;(A) The Batavian Republic (a French &#x27;client state&#x27;) - February 1795 to July 1806.
&lt;br&gt;(B) The (Napoleonic) Kingdom of Holland - July 1806 to July 1810.
&lt;br&gt;(C) The Annexation by France - July 1810 to 1813.
&lt;br&gt;(D) The restored United Provinces of the Netherlands - 1813 to March 1815.

=== 2nd Rate (80/90-gun ships) ===
The eight ships of the &quot;Wrecker&quot; Class were built at Amsterdam and Rotterdam between 1797 and 1811. They were the largest sailing warships built in the Netherlands up to that time. The five Amsterdam-built ships (by master shipwrights R. Dorsman and P. Schuijt Jnr.) had ports for 80 guns, with 30 on the lower deck, 30 on the upper deck and 20 on the quarterdeck and forecastle - they actually mounted (in French service) twenty-eight 36-&quot;livre&quot; guns, thirty 30-&quot;livre&quot; guns, fourteen 12-&quot;livre&quot; guns, two 60-&quot;livre&quot; and six 30-&quot;livre&quot; carronades. The three Rotterdam-built ships (by master shipwright Pieter Glavimans Jnr., who probably produced the overall design for the class) were initially assigned 10 more ports on the quarterdeck and forecastle (with 10 guns behind ports and 20 in the open), causing them to be rated as 90-gun ships.

The class measured 195 (Amsterdam) feet in length, 51 feet in breadth, and 22 feet in depth in hold.

All eight ships were incorporated into the French Imperial Navy on 9 July 1810, and received French names. All were rated as 80-gun ships by the French, armed as mentioned above. All were returned to Dutch service and renamed in 1814, except for the &quot;Admiraal Piet Hein&quot; (ii) which had been re-worked as a 74-gun ship on the stocks at Rotterdam and was seized by the Dutch in their December 1813 uprising.

<doc id="995297" wikidata="Q615110" url="?curid=995297" title="Deen (band)">
<text>is a Japanese popular music band that formed in 1992. Members frequently changed until the release of the first album, and from there Deen has had four members: vocalist and lyricist Shuichi Ikemori, keyboardist and leader Koji Yamane, guitarist Shinji Tagawa and drummer Naoki Uzumoto. In January 2000, Utsumoto and in March 2018, Tagawa left the group. The band has sold over 15 million compact discs.

==History==
===Origin and early years (1992–1997)===
In the &quot;Being&quot; agency, Show Wesugi (original vocalist with Wands) and Tetsurō Oda made song &quot;Konomama Kimidake wo Ubaisaritai&quot; (lit. &quot;Now, I want to make off with only you&quot;). The group was formed for singing this song. The band debuted with the single on March 10, 1993. The single was certified a million-seller by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Their 1994 song &quot;Hitomi Sorasanaide&quot; (lit. &quot;Don&#x27;t Avert Your Eyes&quot;), written by Izumi Sakai and Tetsurō Oda, reached number-one position on the Japanese Oricon charts. Their first album &quot;Deen&quot; was also certified a million-seller by RIAJ.

The group originally seemed to be just a project, but they began to perform live concerts in 1996. They also began to release their self-produced singles, but their sales declined. Their 1997 song &quot;Yume de Aru Youni&quot; (lit. &quot;Hope that it will be a dream&quot;), written by themselves, was adopted by &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;. It was no longer able to reach Top 10 on the Oricon charts. But for fans, this song remained most popular over a decade.

===1998–2017===
In 1998, the band partly moved to BMG Japan under the Berg label, which consisted of the &quot;Being&quot; agency artists. Since their 1999 single &quot;Just One&quot;, almost all singles have been produced by them, but Utsumoto left Deen in 2000. They introduced classical music into their music. In 2002, they released a cover version of Kyu Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o&quot;, featuring solo violinist Diana Yukawa. They began to call their style &quot;Neo-AOR&quot; after album &quot;Pray&quot;.

The band completely moved from the &quot;being&quot; agency to BMG Japan in 2003. Their next album &quot;Utopia&quot;, released on November 5, 2003, enlisted the help of Al Schmitt. In 2006, baseball manager Bobby Valentine participated in the music video of their song &quot;Diamond&quot;.

On June 8, 2008, they performed their first live concert at the Nippon Budokan. On December 10, 2008, they released the single &quot;Eien no Ashita&quot; (lit. &quot;Eternal Tomorrow&quot;), adopted by &quot;Tales of Hearts&quot;. The single debuted at #6 on the Oricon weekly single charts. It was their highest position after 1996.

===2018–present===
On January 12, 2018, the guitarist and composer Tagawa has announced withdrawal from the band after 25th anniversary Budoukan Live finishes, which makes now left only two members keyboardist Yamane and vocalist Ikemori. On February 28 they released compilation album &quot;DEEN The Best FOREVER Complete Singles+&quot; as part of their 25th debut anniversary, which will include their final song as 3 members &quot;Journey&quot;. In August they&#x27;ve released three digital singles which includes completely new song &quot;Aloha&quot; and rearrangement of famous hits as &quot;Hitomi Sorasanaide&quot; and &quot;Power of Love&quot; with subtitle &quot;Jawaiian Style&quot;. On December 26 they&#x27;ve released 25th music video and blu-ray live footage &quot;Deen Live Joy Countdown Special: Solo! Solo!! Solo!!!&quot;, it&#x27;s also final work there former guitarist Tagawa is included as a member.

Since December 31, 2018 until January 13, 2019 the band held their &quot;Live Joy Break&quot; tour &quot;Deen Live Joy Break 21: Best Songs 21 Years&quot;. On February 6, the band as two-member will release their single &quot;Mirai Kara no Hikari&quot; (Light from the Future) which will be used as an theme song for popular video game series Tales&#x27;s new chapter &quot;Tales of the Rays: Fairy’s Requiem&quot;, it will be the first single since &quot;Kimi he no Uta&quot; from 2017. It will be their third promotional song to the same video game series. On 13 March, the single will be included in their first two-member studio album &quot;NewJourney&quot;.

In October 2023, Ikemori himself as representative of Deen, made guest appearance at the Japan&#x27;s Anime Song Festival held at Melaka, Malaysia. It became his first stage appearance in Malaysia since his debut.

The states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu were officially established in 220, 221, and 229 respectively. Therefore, certain people in the list who died before these years have their respective lords&#x27; names, in place of either of the three states, listed in the allegiance column. Take Guan Yu for example — he died before Liu Bei established Shu Han in 221, so his allegiance is listed as &quot;Liu Bei&quot; instead of &quot;Shu Han&quot;.

<doc id="995303" wikidata="Q379111" url="?curid=995303" title="St Matthew Passion">
<text>The St Matthew Passion (), BWV 244, is a &quot;Passion&quot;, a sacred oratorio written by Johann Sebastian Bach in 1727 for solo voices, double choir and double orchestra, with libretto by Picander. It sets the 26th and 27th chapters of the Gospel of Matthew (in the Luther Bible) to music, with interspersed chorales and arias. It is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of Baroque sacred music. The original Latin title  translates to &quot;The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the Evangelist Matthew&quot;.
==History==

The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; is the second of two Passion settings by Bach that have survived in their entirety, the first being the &quot;St John Passion&quot;, first performed in 1724.

===Versions and contemporaneous performances===
Little is known with certainty about the creation process of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;. The available information derives from extant early manuscripts, contemporary publications of the libretto, and circumstantial data, for instance in documents archived by the Town Council of Leipzig.

The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; was probably first performed on 11 April (Good Friday) 1727 in the St. Thomas Church, and again on 15 April 1729, 30 March 1736, and 23 March 1742. Bach then revised it again between 1743 and 1746.

====First version (BWV 244.1, previously 244b)====
In Leipzig it was not allowed to paraphrase the words of the Gospel in a Passion presentation on Good Friday. A setting of the then-popular &quot;Brockes Passion&quot; libretto, largely consisting of such paraphrasing, could not be done without replacing the paraphrases by actual Gospel text. That was the option chosen by Bach for his 1724 &quot;St John Passion&quot;. In 1725 Christian Friedrich Henrici, a Leipzig poet who used Picander as his pen name, had published (&quot;Edifying Thoughts on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday&quot;), containing free verse suitable for a Passion presentation in addition to the Gospel text. Bach seems to have stimulated the poet to write more of such verse in order to come to a full-fledged libretto for a Passion presentation combined with the Passion text chapters 26 and 27 in the Gospel of St Matthew.

Since 1975, it has usually been assumed that Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; was first performed on Good Friday 11 April 1727, although its first performance may have been as late as Good Friday 1729, as older sources assert. The performance took place in the St. Thomas Church (&quot;Thomaskirche&quot;) in Leipzig. Bach had been Thomaskantor (i.e., Cantor, and responsible for the music in the church) since 1723. In this version the Passion was written for two choruses and orchestras. Choir I consists of a soprano in ripieno voice, a soprano solo, an alto solo, a tenor solo, SATB chorus, two traversos, two oboes, two oboes d&#x27;amore, two oboes da caccia, lute, strings (two violin sections, violas and cellos), and continuo (at least organ). Choir II consists of SATB voices, violin I, violin II, viola, viola da gamba, cello, two traversos, two oboes (d&#x27;amore) and possibly continuo.

====Funeral cantata for Köthen (BWV 1143, previously 244a)====

&quot;Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt&quot;, BWV 244a, a cantata of which only the text is extant, was performed 24 March 1729 in Köthen at a memorial service held some months after the death of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. The music of the cantata consisted largely of music adapted from the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;.

====Passion performances in the St. Thomas Church====

At the time only men sang in church: high pitch vocal parts were usually performed by treble choristers. In 1730, Bach informed the Leipzig Town Council as to what he saw as the number of singers that should be available for the churches under his responsibility, including those for the St. Thomas Church: a choir of twelve singers, plus eight singers that would serve both St. Thomas and the &quot;Peterskirche&quot;. The request was only partially granted by the Town Council, so possibly at least some of the Passion presentations in St. Thomas were with fewer than twenty singers, even for the large scale works, like the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, that were written for double choir.

In Bach&#x27;s time, St. Thomas Church had two organ lofts: the large organ loft that was used throughout the year for musicians performing in Sunday services, vespers, etc., and the small organ loft, situated at the opposite side of the former, that was used additionally in the grand services for Christmas and Easter. The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; was composed as to perform a single work from both organ lofts at the same time: Chorus and orchestra I would occupy the large organ loft, and Chorus and orchestra II performed from the small organ loft. The size of the organ lofts limited the number of performers for each Choir. Large choruses, in addition to the instrumentists indicated for Choir I and II, would have been impossible, so also here there is an indication that each part (including those of strings and singers) would have a limited number of performers, where, for the choruses, the numbers indicated by Bach in his 1730 request would appear to be (more than?) a maximum of what could be fitted in the organ lofts.

====Later revisions and performances (BWV 244.2, previously 244)====
Bach revised the Passion by 1736, for a performance on Good Friday 30 March 1736. This is the version (with some possible later adjustments) that is generally known as the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, BWV 244. In this version both choirs have SATB soloists and chorus, and a string section and continuo consisting of at least violins I and II, viola, gamba and organ. The woodwinds are two traversos, oboes and oboes d&#x27;amore for each choir, and in addition for choir I two oboes da caccia.

Some parts were adjusted for a new performance on Good Friday 23 March 1742. Bach finalized his autograph score in 1743–1746; however, this undertaking was not tied to any new performance.

===Numbering of the movements===

Bach did not number the sections of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, all of them vocal movements, but twentieth-century scholars have done so. The two main schemes in use today are the scheme from the Neue Bach-Ausgabe (NBA, New Bach Edition) which uses a 1 through 68 numbering system, and the older Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, Bach Works Catalog) scheme which divides the work into 78 numbers. Both use lettered subsections in some cases. This article is written using the NBA numbering system.

=== Text ===
Bach worked together with his librettist, Christian Friedrich Henrici, known as Picander who published the text of the libretto of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in 1729.

====Bible text====
The Bible text used for Part One is . Part Two uses and .

Additionally, is used in the opening aria (with chorus) of Part Two (No. 30).

====Free verse====
Picander wrote text for recitatives and arias, and for the large scale choral movements that open and close the Passion. Other libretto sections came from publications by Salomo Franck and Barthold Heinrich Brockes.

====Chorales====

The chorale melodies and their texts would have been known to those attending the services in the St Thomas church. The oldest chorale Bach used in the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; dates from 1525. Three chorales are written by Paul Gerhardt and Bach included five stanzas from his &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot;. Bach used the hymns in different ways, most are four-part setting, two as the of the two chorale fantasias framing Part I, one as a commenting element in a tenor recitative.

In the early version BWV 244b the chorale No. 17 appears to be missing, and movement No. 29, concluding Part One, is a four-part setting of the chorale &quot;Jesum lass ich nicht von mir&quot; instead of the chorale fantasia on &quot;O Mensch, bewein dein Sünde groß&quot;.

== Composition ==

Many composers wrote musical settings of the Passion in the late 17th century. Like other Baroque oratorio passions, Bach&#x27;s setting presents the Biblical text of Matthew 26–27 in a relatively simple way, primarily using recitative, while aria and arioso movements set newly written poetic texts which comment on the various events in the Biblical narrative and present the characters&#x27; states of mind in a lyrical, monologue-like manner.

The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; is set for two choirs and two orchestras. Both include two transverse flutes (Choir 1 also includes 2 recorders for No. 19), two oboes, in certain movements instead oboe d&#x27;amore or oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, viola da gamba, and basso continuo. For practical reasons the continuo organ is often shared and played with both orchestras. In many arias a solo instrument or more create a specific mood, such as the central soprano aria No. 49, &quot;, where the absence of strings and basso continuo mark a desperate loss of security.

===Vocal parts===
Two distinctive aspects of Bach&#x27;s setting spring from his other church endeavors. One is the double-choir format, which stems from his own double-choir motets and those of many other composers with which he routinely started Sunday services. The other is the extensive use of chorales, which appear in standard four-part settings, as interpolations in arias, and as a cantus firmus in large polyphonic movements. This is notable in &quot;, the conclusion of the first half – a movement which Bach also used as an opening chorus for the second version (1725) of his &quot;St John Passion&quot; (later – ca. 1730 – he reverted to the originally composed &quot;Herr, unser Herrscher&quot; there). The opening chorus, &quot;&quot; is also notable for the use of chorale cantus firmus, in which the &quot;soprano in ripieno&quot; crowns a colossal buildup of polyphonic and harmonic tension, singing a verse of &quot;&quot;. This was sung only in 1742 and 1743–1746 and had been played on the organ before.

====Gospel parts====

The narration of the Gospel texts is sung by the tenor Evangelist in &quot;secco&quot; recitative accompanied only by continuo. Soloists sing the words of various characters, also in recitative; in addition to Jesus, there are named parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests (Pontifex I &amp; II), Pontius Pilate, Pilate&#x27;s wife (Uxor Pilati), two witnesses (Testis I &amp; II) and two &quot;ancillae&quot; (maids). These are not always sung by all different soloists. The &quot;character&quot; soloists are also often assigned arias and sing with the choirs, a practice not always followed by modern performances. Two duets are sung by a pair of soloists representing two simultaneous speakers. A number of passages for several speakers, called &quot;turba&quot; (crowd) parts, are sung by one of the two choirs or both.

The words of Jesus, also termed &quot;Vox Christi&quot; (voice of Christ), usually receive special treatment. Bach created particularly distinctive accompagnato recitatives in this work: they are accompanied not by continuo alone, but also by the entire string section of the first orchestra using long, sustained notes and &quot;highlighting&quot; certain words, thus creating an effect often referred to as Jesus&#x27;s &quot;halo&quot;. Only his final words, in Aramaic, &quot;Eli, Eli lama asabthani?&quot; (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), are sung without this &quot;halo&quot;.

In the revision of 1743–1746, it is also these words (the Vox Christi) that receive a sustained continuo part. In all prior versions (1727/1729, 1736, and 1742), the continuo part was sustained in all recitatives.

==== Interpolated texts ====
The arias, set to texts by Picander, are interspersed between sections of the Gospel text. They are sung by soloists with a variety of instrumental accompaniments, typical of the oratorio style. The interpolated texts theologically and personally interpret the Gospel texts. Many of them include the listener into the action, such as the chorale No. 10, &quot;&quot; (&quot;It is I who should suffer&quot;), after eleven disciples asked &quot; (Lord, is it I?) – meaning: Am I the one going to betray? The alto aria No. 6, &quot;, portrays a desire to anoint Jesus with her tears out of remorse. The bass aria No. 65, &quot;Mache dich, mein Herze, rein&quot;, offers to bury Jesus himself. Jesus is often referred to as &quot;my Jesus&quot;. The chorus alternates between participating in the narrative and commenting on it.

As is typical of settings of the Passion (and originating in its liturgical use on Palm Sunday), there is no mention of the Resurrection in any of these texts (apart from indirect allusions at Matthew 26:32 and 27:53 and 63). Following the concept of Anselm of Canterbury, the crucifixion is the endpoint and the source of redemption; the emphasis is on the suffering of Jesus. The chorus sings, in the final chorale No. 62, &quot;tear me from my fears / through your own fear and pain.&quot; The bass, referring to the &quot;sweet cross&quot; expresses in No. 56, &quot;Yes, of course this flesh and blood in us / want to be forced to the cross; / the better it is for our soul, / the more bitter it feels.&quot;

The first &quot;&quot; chorale compares Jesus&#x27; crucifixion to the ritual sacrifice of an Old Testament lamb, as an offering for sin. This theme is reinforced by the concluding chorale of the first part, (O man, bewail your great sin).

=== Compositional style ===
Bach&#x27;s recitatives often set the mood for the particular passages by highlighting emotionally charged words such as &quot;crucify&quot;, &quot;kill&quot;, or &quot;mourn&quot; with chromatic melodies. Diminished seventh chords and sudden modulations accompany Jesus&#x27;s apocalyptic prophecies.

In the turba parts, the two choruses sometimes alternate in cori spezzati style (e.g. &quot;) and sometimes sing together (&quot;). Other times only one chorus sings (chorus I always takes the parts of the disciples) or they alternate, for example when &quot;some bystanders&quot; say &quot;He&#x27;s calling for Elijah&quot;, and &quot;others&quot; say &quot;Wait to see if Elijah comes to help him.&quot;

In the arias, obbligato instruments are equal partners with the voices, as was customary in late Baroque arias. Bach often uses madrigalisms, as in &quot;, where the flutes start playing a raindrop-like staccato as the alto sings of drops of his tears falling. In &quot;, the line about the serpent is set with a twisting melody. In &quot;Erbarm es, Gott&quot;, the relentless dotted rhythm of the diminished chords evoke the emotional shock of the scourging.

== Structure ==

As in other Passion oratorios the backbone of the structure is the narration of the Gospel, in this case chapters and of the Gospel of Matthew in the Luther Bible.

===Gospel text===
The Evangelist, a tenor voice, sings the Gospel text in a declamatory style called secco recitative, that is, with only a continuo accompaniment. Direct speech sections of the Gospel text are brought by other singers in the same &quot;secco&quot; format (e.g. a soprano voice sings the words spoken by Pontius Pilate&#x27;s wife), except for:
* Vox Christi: the words spoken by Christ are sung by a bass as an accompagnato recitative, that is: accompanied by strings, and in a more &quot;arioso&quot; style than the secco recitatives.
* Turba choruses: words spoken by a group of people (e.g. Jesus&#x27; disciples) are sung by the choir, usually accompanied by the complete orchestra.

Apart from the Evangelist and the Vox Christi the dramatis personae of these Gospel sections of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; consists of:
* Judas (B), Peter (B), two witnesses (A T), two high priests (B), two maids (S), Pilate (B) and his wife (S)
* A small group is represented by Chorus I or Chorus II separately (Chorus I always for the disciples); High priests and larger groups of people are sung by Chorus I and II together.

===Interpolated text===
In between the sections or scenes of the Gospel text, other texts are sung as a meditation or underlining the action, in a variety of formats:
* soloists sing arias, in most cases preceded by an accompagnato recitative, and occasionally in a dialogue with the choir. These sections are based nearly exclusively on texts by Picander. The arias are in da capo format (ternary form). &quot;Erbarme dich&quot;, for alto, and &quot;Mache dich, mein Herze, rein&quot;, for bass, are examples of such arias in Part Two of the oratorio. In these movements the singers are accompanied by one or a few solo instruments and continuo, occasionally completed by other instrument groups of the orchestra.
* Choral movements come in two additional formats (apart from the turba and dialogue with soloist roles already mentioned above): 
** Cornerstone choral movements, or chorale fantasias: these are the extended movements, typically used to open or close both parts of the oratorio. In the St Matthew Passion there are three such extended choral movements: the opening chorus (&quot;Kommt, ihr Töchter, helft mir klagen&quot;, text by Picander and Nicolaus Decius), the conclusion of Part One (&quot;O Mensch, bewein dein Sünde groß&quot;, text by Sebald Heyden) and the final chorus (&quot;Wir setzen uns mit Tränen nieder&quot;, text by Picander)
** Chorale harmonization movements: using traditional chorale texts and their melodies. The text is sung in homophony by a four-part chorus with colla parte accompaniment by the orchestra. &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot;, on a text by Paul Gerhardt, is the one that returns most often throughout the Passion, in different harmonizations.

== Movements ==
The work is divided into two parts to be performed before and after the sermon of the Good Friday service.

=== Part One ===
The first scenes are in Jerusalem: Jesus announces his death (No. 2), on the other hand the intention to get rid of him is expressed (No. 4). A scene in Bethany (No. 4c) shows a woman anointing his head with valuable oils. The next scene (No. 7) has Judas Iscariot negotiating the price for handing Jesus over. In a great contrast of mood the preparation for the &quot;Easter meal&quot; (Osterlamm) is described (No. 9) and the Passover meal itself, the Last Supper, foreshadowed by the announcement of betrayal. After the meal they go together to the Mount of Olives (No. 14) where Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him three times before the cock crows. At the garden of Gethsemane (No. 18) Jesus asks his followers several times to support him but they fall asleep while he is praying in agony. It is there (No. 26) that he is betrayed by Judas&#x27; kiss and arrested. While soprano and alto mourn (in duet, No. 27a) Jesus&#x27;s arrest, the chorus makes angry interjections of &quot;&quot; (Leave him, stop, do not bind him!). In a dramatic highpoint of the Passion, the chorus (No. 27b) furiously demands against the Jews who arrested Jesus &quot;&quot; (Wreck, ruin, engulf, shatter with sudden force the false betrayer, the murderous blood!).

==== 1. ====

Part One is opened by the chorus &quot; (Come ye daughters, join my lament), on a text by Picander. After 16 measures of instrumental introduction in time, driven by an ostinato rhythm in the basses, Chorus I intones , until in measure 26 they sing (Hark!) and Chorus II promptly asks (Whom?), Chorus I replying with (the bridegroom – implying Christ). The next call by Chorus I is (See him!), followed by the question (How?) by Chorus II, to which Chorus I answers (just like a lamb – another reference to Christ).

The dialogue with these questions is repeated, and then, from measure 30, Chorus I sings the text of the incipit again while in ripieno sopranos sing the first two lines of Nikolaus Decius&#x27; chorale &quot; (O Lamb of God, innocent) as the cantus firmus. All sentences of the first stanza of Decius&#x27; hymn are used as cantus firmus throughout the movement by the ripienists.

The opening chorus continues by taking up the questions and answers by Chorus I and II again, now adding: (See it! — What? – See the endurance) and ultimately (Look! — Where? — to our guilt), after which Chorus I and II sing the last lines of Picander&#x27;s text in separate blocks. When the cantus firmus has died out, Chorus I and II return to the first three lines of the text, from measure 82 until the conclusion of the chorus in measure 90.

==== 2. Mt 26:1–2 ====
:2. Evangelist, Jesus: 
 places the first scene two days before the Passover feast. After a few words of introduction by the Evangelist, the first words of Christ, set as an accompagnato recitative with slow strings, contain an ominous prediction of his imminent fate.

Part I is closed by a four-part Chorale Fantasia (both choirs) on the chorale (O mankind, mourn your great sins), recapitulating that Jesus was born of the Virgin to &quot;become the intercessor&quot;. The sopranos sing the cantus firmus, the other voices interpret aspects of the narration. In the 1742 and 1743–1746 versions, a ripieno soprano choir was added to the soprano line.

In the 1727/1729 version, this part is concluded by a four-part setting of verse 6 of the Chorale &quot;&quot;.

=== Part Two ===
The first scene of Part Two is an interrogation at the High Priest Caiaphas (No. 37) where two witnesses report Jesus having spoken about destroying the Temple and building it again in three days. Jesus is silent to this, but his answer to the question if he is the Son of God is considered a sacrilege calling for his death. Outside in the courtyard (No. 38) Peter is told three times that he belongs to Jesus and denies it three times – then the cock crows. In the morning (No. 41) Jesus is sent to Pontius Pilate while Judas is overcome by remorse and kills himself. Pilate interrogates Jesus (No. 43), is impressed and is inclined to release him, as it was customary to release one prisoner for the holiday, supported in this by his wife. But the crowd, given the choice to have Jesus released or Barabbas, a thief, insurrectionist and murderer, asks with one voice &quot;Barrabam!&quot;. They vote to crucify Jesus, Pilate gives in, washing his hands claiming his innocence, and delivers Jesus to torture and crucifixion. On the way to the crucifixion site (No. 55) Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross. At Golgatha (No. 58) Jesus and two others are crucified and mocked by the crowd. Even his last words are misunderstood. Where he cites Psalm 22, &quot;Eli, Eli, lama asabthani?&quot; (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), he is supposed to have called Elijah. He dies. St. Matthew describes the tearing of the Temple curtain and an earthquake – set to music by Bach. In the evening (No. 63c) Joseph of Arimathea asks Pilate for the corpse for burial. The following day (No. 66) officials remind Pilate of the talk of resurrection and ask for guards and a seal for the grave to prevent fraud.

==== 30. ====
Part Two is opened by a dialog between the alto soloist deploring her lost Jesus and choir II offering help in searching for him, quoting Song of Songs 6:1 (). In the 1727/1729 version, the soloist is a bass.

Chorale

This is by far the most unusually chromatic setting of this chorale tune () found in the &quot;Passion&quot;, occurring at the high point of intensity at the death of Jesus. This also marks the completion of Bach&#x27;s gradual emptying out of the key signature in subsequent settings of this tune: No. 15 has four sharps (E major), No. 17 has three flats (E-flat major), No. 44 has two sharps (D major), No. 54 has one flat (D minor), and No. 62 has no accidentals (A minor).

The work is closed by a grand scale chorus in da capo form, choir I and II mostly in unison for the first part (We sit down in tears), but in dialog in the middle section, choir II repeating &quot;&quot; (&quot;Rest gently, gently rest!&quot;), choir I reflecting: &quot;Your grave and headstone shall, for the anxious conscience, be a comfortable pillow and the resting place for the soul. Highly contented, there the eyes fall asleep.&quot; These are the last words (before the recapitulation), marked by Bach himself: &quot;p pp ppp&quot; (soft, very soft, extremely soft).

== Reception ==

The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; was not heard in more or less its entirety outside Leipzig until 1829, when the twenty-year-old Felix Mendelssohn performed a version in Berlin, with the Berlin Singakademie, to great acclaim. Though most remained the same, Mendelssohn did edit parts of the passion to satisfy the taste of the time. Due to the changes in addition with other circumstances the reception was a success. Mendelssohn&#x27;s revival brought the music of Bach, particularly the large-scale works, to public and scholarly attention (although the &quot;St John Passion&quot; had been rehearsed by the Singakademie in 1822).

Sterndale Bennett 1845 edition of the Passion was to be the first of many (as Adolph Bernhard Marx and Adolf Martin Schlesinger&#x27;s one in 1830), the latest being by Neil Jenkins (1997) and Nicholas Fisher and John Russell (2008). Appreciation, performance and study of Bach&#x27;s composition have persisted into the present era.

===Second half of the 18th century===
The Passion was performed under the Cantor of St. Thomas until about 1800. Specifically, in 1780, the Cantor, Doles, had three of Bach&#x27;s Passions performed, assumed to include the St. John and St. Matthew, and &quot;possibly the St. Luke&quot;.

===19th century===
In 1824, Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s maternal grandmother Bella Salomon had given him a copy of the score of the Passion. Carl Friedrich Zelter had been head of the Sing-Akademie since 1800. He had been hired to teach music theory to both Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny. Zelter had a supply of J. S. Bach scores and was an admirer of Bach&#x27;s music but he was reluctant to undertake public performances.

When Felix Mendelssohn was preparing his revival performance of the Passion in 1829 in Berlin (the first performance outside Leipzig), he cut out &quot;ten arias (about a third of them), seven choruses (about half), [but] only a few of the chorales,&quot; which &quot;emphasized the drama of the Passion story ... at the expense of the reflective and Italianate solo singing.&quot;

In 1827, Felix and a few friends began weekly sessions to rehearse the Passion. One of the group was Eduard Devrient, a baritone and since 1820 one of the principal singers at the Berlin Royal Opera. Around December 1828 – January 1829 Devrient persuaded Felix that the two of them should approach Zelter to get the Sing-Akademie to support their project. Devrient was especially enthusiastic, hoping to sing the part of Jesus as he eventually did. Zelter was reluctant but eventually gave his approval; that of the Singakademie board followed.

Once the fuller group of singers and the orchestra were brought in, Devrient recalled, participants were amazed at &quot;the abundance of melodies, the rich expression of emotion, the passion, the singular style of declamation, and the force of the dramatic action.&quot; The 20-year-old Felix himself conducted the rehearsals and first two performances by the Singakademie.

Their first performance was effectively publicized in six consecutive issues of the &quot;Berliner Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung&quot;, founded and edited by Adolf Bernhard Marx. It took place on 11 March 1829 and was sold out quickly. There was a second performance on 21 March, also sold out. In a third, on 18 April, Zelter conducted, and soon there were performances in Frankfurt (where a previously projected performance of the Passion had been upstaged by those in Berlin) and in Breslau and Stettin.

William Sterndale Bennett became a founder of the Bach Society of London in 1849 with the intention of introducing Bach&#x27;s works to the English public. Helen Johnston (a student at Queen&#x27;s College, London) translated the libretto of the Passion, and Bennett conducted the first English performance at the Hanover Square Rooms London on 6 April 1854 (the same year that it appeared in print by the Old Bach Society (Alte Bach-Gesellschaft). The soloists included Charlotte Helen Sainton-Dolby.

===20th century===
Excerpts of the work were performed on the American television program &quot;Omnibus&quot; on 31 March 1957 in the episode &quot;The Music of J.S. Bach.&quot; The presenter and explicator was Leonard Bernstein, who introduced the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; as &quot;that glorious work that started me off on my own private passion for Bach.&quot;

The &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; has been presented in staged performances. Typically, these are done with all performers in street clothes or neutral costumes, the orchestras on stage, at least the soloists singing without scores from memory, and the words acted out in a solemn, melodramatic fashion with only a minimal stage set. On the other hand, George Balanchine staged it in 1943 with Stokowski conducting. Other notable staged performances include Jonathan Miller&#x27;s 1997 production in English.

The Hamburg Ballet presented a &quot;Saint Matthew Passion&quot;, created and choreographed by John Neumeier, at the Hamburg State Opera in 1981. The Hamburg Ballet production has been reproduced several times, including at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 1983 and the Los Angeles Opera in 2022. The Los Angeles Opera presentation involved &quot;42 dancers, six singers, two choruses, and two mighty-in-sound chamber orchestras.&quot;

===21st century===
Staged productions of the &quot;Passion&quot; include Lindy Hume&#x27;s 2005 production for the Perth International Arts Festival, restaged in 2013 for Opera Queensland with , Sara Macliver, Tobias Cole; and Peter Sellars&#x27; 2010 production with the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle with Mark Padmore, Camilla Tilling, Magdalena Kožená, Topi Lehtipuu, Christian Gerhaher and Thomas Quasthoff.

<doc id="995305" wikidata="Q209608" url="?curid=995305" title="Coat of arms of Malaysia">
<text>The coat of arms of Malaysia () is a coat of arms comprising a shield or escutcheon, two tigers for supporters, a crescent and fourteen-pointed star for a crest and a motto. As the Malaysian coat of arms descended from that of the Federated Malay States under British colonial rule, it resembles European heraldic designs.

== Design ==
The coat of arms consists of a shield guarded by two rampant tigers as supporters. The shield is topped by a crest consisting of a yellow crescent with a 14-pointed &quot;federal star&quot;, and includes a motto, on a banner, at the bottom.

=== Crest or helm ===
The yellow colour of the crest, a crescent and a 14-pointed federal star, symbolises the country&#x27;s monarchy. The crescent also represents Islam as the official religion while the federal star represents the thirteen states and the Federal Territories of Malaysia.

Originally, the fourteen-pointed star represented the original fourteen states of Malaysia, which included Singapore. It was not changed when Singapore left the Federation in 1965, but it has generally been accepted that the 14th point represents the Federal Territories.

=== Escutcheon ===
The escutcheon, represented by a shield, is primarily intended to serve as a representation of states unified under the Malaysian federation, and is subdivided into ten divisions.

The upper portion or chief of the shield contains five krises on a red background, representing the five former Unfederated Malay States, Johore, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and Perlis. The remainder of the shield, which in the coat of arms of Malaya was divided in three &quot;per pale&quot; (longitudinally) between the former Federated Malay States, Penang and Malacca, is now divided into four sections:
* In the dexter (left from the observer&#x27;s point of view) section is the Pinang palm along with the Penang Bridge representing Penang
* In the upper middle of the shield, below the row of krises, are the colours of the Federated Malay States (red, black, white and yellow) arranged from left to right. The permutations of the colours red, black, white and yellow make up the colours of these states&#x27; flags. Red, black and yellow are for Negeri Sembilan; black and white for Pahang; black, white and yellow for Perak; and red and yellow for Selangor.
* In the lower middle of the shield, there are three sections formerly representing the new (in 1963) states of Sabah, Singapore and Sarawak. Since 1965, Singapore&#x27;s section has been replaced by a depiction of the national flower, the hibiscus.
* In the sinister (right from the observer&#x27;s point of view) section is the &quot;Malacca&quot; tree representing the state of Malacca.

=== Supporters ===
The two rampant tigers supporting the shield are traditional Malay symbols. They are retained from the earlier armorial ensign of the Federation of Malaya, and prior to that of the Federated Malay States. They symbolise strength and courage.

=== Motto ===
The motto of the arms, located below the shield, consists of a banner with the phrase &quot;Unity is Strength&quot; (&quot;Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu&quot;) written in both romanised Malay and Jawi. The original English phrase was replaced by romanised Malay in 1963.

== History ==

=== Federated Malay States and Malayan Union ===

The origins of the Malaysian coat of arms can be traced to the formation of the Federated Malay States (FMS) under the colonial rule of the United Kingdom. In conjunction with the introduction of the flag of the Federated Malay States in 1895, the FMS coat of arms was adopted and remained in use from 1895 to the formation of the Federation of Malaya in 1948.

The arms, like its modern successors, included a shield, two tigers, and a banner, but depicts an eastern crown on the helm, representing the four sultanates. The shield&#x27;s design was also significantly simpler; as the FMS consists of only four states, the shield encompassed a quarterly &quot;party per cross&quot; division representing the colours of the flag of the four FMS (in the same way the flag of the FMS represents the states, and the colours in the modern Malaysian arms represent the same states). The motto was also originally written in Jawi as &quot;Dipelihara Allah&quot; (Under God&#x27;s (Allah&#x27;s) Protection) flanked by two eight-pointed stars. Dipelihara Allah is today the Selangor state motto.

While the establishment of the Malayan Union in 1946 brought about the merging of the FMS with the five Unfederated Malay States and two of the Straits Settlements (excluding Singapore), the FMS arms remained in use unchanged as the Union&#x27;s coat of arms for two years before the Union&#x27;s dissolution.

=== Federation of Malaya ===
The founding of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 led to a revision of the arms. Among the changes were a more complete representation the 11 states of the federation on the shield (where new partitions containing insignias of the additional states added over and beside the original FMS colours), the replacement of the eastern crown with a yellow crescent and an 11-pointed federal star (symbols representing the 11 states that were derived from the flag of the Federation of Malaya). The original Jawi motto was also replaced with &quot;Unity is Strength&quot; in both English and Jawi Malay.

At the point of adoption, the shield was composed of the following elements:
* In chief, the five &quot;kris&quot;es representing the Unfederated Malay States;
* In pale, the quartered colours of the FMS;
* In dexter, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers, crenellation, and waves from the Penang coat of arms; and
* In sinister, and gate of &quot;A Famosa&quot; from the Malaccan coat of arms.

=== Malaysia ===

The arms was amended a second time after the formation of Malaysia, with the admission of Singapore and the Borneo states of North Borneo (Sabah) and Sarawak in 1963. The increased number of states later resulted in the modification of the Federation of Malaya coat of arms to support the three new member states with the widening of the shield. The tigers were redesigned to assume different positions of limbs (front limbs reaching over and behind the shield, and rear limbs reaching over the motto and the shield), and minor adjustments were also made on the appearance of the banner and the length of the crescent, while the 11-pointed federal star was updated to include 14 points. In tandem with Malay as Malaysia&#x27;s national language, the English motto was replaced with Malay language.

During this period of revision, the Malacca&#x27;s colonial &quot;A Famosa&quot; insignia was replaced by a Malacca tree. Some of the symbols was modified to eliminate the colonial symbols and other non-Islamic symbols. While other symbols was remained. Penang&#x27;s Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers and crenellation were gradually replaced, by first substituting the feathers with a Pinang palm, and later, the crenellation with the Penang Bridge (which was constructed and completed during the 1980s) and the barry wavy of eight Azure and Argent to ten. Following the expulsion of Singapore in 1965, the coat of arms was redesigned again. In 1988, Sarawak&#x27;s symbol replaced by the current hornbill-based state arms; similarly, Sabah, which was originally represented by only its flag held up by a pair of arms from its pre-1963 state coat of arms (blazoned &quot;tierced of the crest of Sabah&quot;), was revised to fully feature its current state arms in entirely. The Malaysia&#x27;s version of coat of arms later resulted in a more realistic and aggressive appearance of tigers.

The arms is adopted on several state flags. The Royal Standard of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the flag of the Federal Territories and the flag of Putrajaya all feature the arms charged in the centre largely unmodified.

<doc id="995311" wikidata="Q938737" url="?curid=995311" title="List of ships of the line of France">
<text>This is a list of French ships of the line of the period 1621–1870 (plus some from the period before 1621). Battlefleet units in the French Navy (&quot;Marine Royale&quot; before the French Revolution established a republic) were categorised as &quot;vaisseaux&quot; (literally &quot;vessels&quot;) as distinguished from lesser warships such as frigates (&quot;frégates&quot;). The &quot;vaisseaux&quot; were classified according to size and/or firepower into a series of &quot;Rangs&quot; (ranks), roughly equivalent to the system of Rates used by the British Navy, although these did not correspond exactly. By 1671 there was a system of five &quot;Rangs&quot;, which officially pertained for over a century; the first three of these &quot;Rangs&quot; comprised the battlefleet &quot;vaisseaux&quot;, while the Fourth and Fifth &quot;Rangs&quot; comprised the larger frigates (&quot;frégates-vaisseaux&quot; or simply &quot;frégates&quot;). In practice, by the early decades of the 18th century the formal ranking system among the &quot;vaisseaux&quot; had in practice been overtaken by a division based on the number of carriage guns borne in practice by individual ships.

The article is divided into sections according to the Head of State at the time, which names are provided as chronological references.

Note that throughout this article the term &quot;-pounder&quot; refers to French pre-metric units of weight (&quot;livres&quot;), which were almost 8% greater than UK/US units of the same name; every other maritime power likewise established its own system of weights and each country&#x27;s &#x27;pound&#x27; was different from that of every other nation. Similarly, French pre-metric units of length (&quot;pieds&quot; and &quot;pouces&quot;) were 6.575% longer than equivalent UK/US units of measurement; the pre-metric French foot was equivalent to 324.8394 mm, whereas the UK/US foot equalled 304.8 mm. These differences should be taken into account in any calculations based on the units given below.

== Valois-Angoulême dynasty (1515 to 1589) ==
Francis I was the first of the five French Kings of the Valois-Angoulême dynasty, who reigned from 1515 to 1589:

* Francis I (1 January 1515 – 31 March 1547)
* Henry II (1 April 1547 – 10 July 1559) – second son of Francis I
* Francis II (10 July 1559 – 5 December 1560) – eldest son of Henry II
* Charles IX (5 December 1560 – 30 May 1574) – third son of Henry II
* Henry III (30 May 1574 – 2 August 1589) (assassinated) – fourth son of Henry II

The application of the Salic law meant that with the extinction of the Valois in the male line, the Bourbons succeeded to the throne as descendants of Louis IX.
Very few of the names of French ships of this era are known.
* &quot;Grande Française&quot; (1533)
* &quot;Caraquon&quot; (1544)

== Henri IV (1589 to 1610) ==
*&quot;Lune&quot; (1608) ex-Dutch &quot;Maan&quot;, built 1604 at Amsterdam
*&quot;Saint Louis&quot; (1609)

==Louis XIII (1610 to 1643)==

The first seven years of this reign were under the Regency of Marie de Médicis, the consort of Henri IV – Louis XIII&#x27;s father, who had been assassinated in 1610. Following the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré and the Siege of La Rochelle, and in line with his general efforts to enhance the prestige and status of France in Europe, the Cardinal de Richelieu had a number of warships purchased from Holland, and eventually built in France by Holland-instructed French engineers. The largest of these early ships of the line, such as the famous 72-gun &quot;Couronne&quot; launched in 1638, would mount a number of guns comparable to later units of the 18th and 19th century, but the brunt of these ships would mount between 20 and 40 guns. The artillery was also comparatively lighter: the &quot;Couronne&quot; mounted 18-pounder long guns on her main battery, where any of the numerous 74-gun ships of the line that formed the backbone of the Navy from the late 18th century would mount 36-pounder long guns and 18-pounders would become common on frigates.

===Ships of the Line (&quot;vaisseaux&quot;)===
* &quot;Ours d&#x27;Or&quot; (purchased 1618 at Middlebourg) – not mentioned after 1624
*Dutch-built vessels

** &quot;Grand Galion de Malte&quot; (loaned May 1621) – returned to the Order of Malta in 1623 
* &quot;Saint Jean&quot; (1621) – disarmed 1637
* &quot;Saint Michel&quot; (June 1621) – not mentioned after 1623
* Vessels purchased in January 1625 at Blavet from the &quot;Order of the Milice Chrétienne&quot;; on 18 January all five were captured by Huguenot forces in a raid, but were retaken or destroyed by the King&#x27;s forces later in 1625
** &quot;Saint Basile&quot; (1625) – disposal unknown
** &quot;Saint François&quot; (1625) – destroyed in action 17 September 1625
** &quot;Saint Jean&quot; (1625) – converted to fireship 1640
** &quot;Saint Louis de Nevers&quot; (1625) – disposal unknown
** &quot;Saint Michel&quot; (1625) – deleted 1629

When Richelieu decided to renew the French Royal Navy in 1625, he began by ordering a number of warships to be built in Holland, as the French shipbuilding industry was not at that date capable of constructing them in sufficient quantity. However, in the interim, before these new ships could be built, he arranged to fill the gap by leasing or hiring a number of Dutch and English ships. In June 1625 he procured twenty Dutch warships, of which one was lost in action on 16 July and another on 17 September; the remaining eighteen ships were returned to the Dutch on 10 March 1626. In July 1625 he also hired the English Second rate warship &quot;Vanguard&quot;, and in August added six ships hired from the English East India Company; all these were returned to their owners on 26 May 1626. As these were never at any date owned by the French, they are excluded from the list below.
* &quot;Corail&quot; (1626 in Holland) – not mentioned after 1639
* &quot;Europe&quot; (1626 in Holland) – condemned 1645
* &quot;Fortune&quot; (1626 in Holland) – sold January 1650
* &quot;Hercule&quot; (1626 in Holland) – deleted by 1635
* &quot;Licorne&quot; (1626 in Holland) – lost off Sardinia 1643
*&quot;Vierge&quot; 48 (purchased) – Captured by the Rochellais, blew up at Ile de Ré on 17 September 1625
* &quot;Espérance de Dieu&quot; (1627)
* &quot;Grand Saint Louis&quot; (1627)

==Louis XIV (1643 to 1715)==

The first eight years of this reign were under the Regency of Anne of Austria, the consort of Louis XIII, while French politics were dominated by Cardinal Jules Mazarin, who served as Chief Minister from 1642, and Louis XIV did not achieve personal rule until the death of Cardinal Mazarin in March 1661.

The French rating system was historically a division into three Ranks, but a new system of four Ranks was provisionally created in 1669; however a new system quickly replaced this in 1671. Earlier vessels are shown under the rating they were given in 1671 – in the case of vessels deleted prior to 1671, these are included according to the rate they &quot;would&quot; have been given in 1671 had they not been deleted. Under this new system, French major warships were from 1671 divided into five ranks or &quot;Rangs&quot;; ships of the line (&quot;vaisseaux&quot;) were divided into the highest three ranks.

The original rating system was thoroughly reformed under Colbert&#x27;s administration two years later, on 24 June 1671, and the overwhelming majority of French warships underwent name changes at that date; vessels are listed below under their original name at time of launching or acquisition, even if they subsequently were better known by the name they were given later.

Vessels of the Fourth and Fifth Ranks were categorised as frigates (&quot;frégates&quot; or &quot;frégates-vaisseaux&quot;) of the 1st Order and 2nd Order respectively; light frigates (&quot;frégates légères&quot;) and even smaller vessels were excluded from the rating system.

===First Rank Ships (&quot;vaisseaux de Premier Rang&quot;)===

From 1670, the First Rank could be categorised as ships of the line carrying more than 70 carriage guns (although other factors also played a part in determining what Rank a ship was given); in 1690 this was limit was effectively risen to ships carrying 80 or more guns.

====&quot;Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Extraordinaire&quot;====

The largest and most heavily armed First Rank ships, effectively those carrying 100 carriage guns or more, were placed in a sub-category of &quot;Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Extraordinaire&quot;. Only a few of these were built, but they always provided the flagships of the two Fleets – the &quot;Flotte du Levant&quot; (on the Mediterranean coast of France) and the &quot;Flotte du Ponant&quot; (on the Atlantic and Channel coasts). They were all full three-deckers, i.e. with three full-length gun decks, with the uppermost of these surmounted by an armed forecastle, quarterdeck and poop.

*&quot;Royal Louis&quot; 104 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe Gédéon, launched 1 February 1668 at Toulon) – renamed &quot;Royal Louis Vieux&quot; 1692 and broken up 1697. Nominally assigned 120 guns, but never carried more than 104.
*&quot;Dauphin Royal&quot; 100, later 104 guns (designed and built by François Pomet, launched 29 March 1668 at Toulon) – broken up 1700
*&quot;Royal Duc&quot; 104 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched December 1668 at Brest) – renamed &quot;Reine&quot; in June 1671 and broken up 1688
*&quot;Soleil Royal&quot; 106, later 110 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 13 December 1669 at Brest) – burnt by the English in an action at Cherbourg in June 1692
*&quot;Victorieux&quot; 108 guns (designed and built by François Pomet, probably launched in late 1675 at Rochefort) – broken up 1685 (badly built and never brought into service)
*&quot;Royal Louis&quot; 110 guns (designed and built by François Coulomb snr, launched 22 September 1692 at Toulon) – broken up 1727
*&quot;Foudroyant&quot; 104 guns (designed and built by Étienne Hubac, launched 24 December 1692 at Brest) – exchanged names with &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; in March 1693 (see below), broken up 1714
*&quot;Terrible&quot; 100/104 guns (designed and built by Blaise Pangalo, launched 21 February 1693 at Brest) – broken up 1714
*&quot;Foudroyant&quot; 104 guns (designed and built by Blaise Pangalo, launched 14 November 1693 at Brest) – originally to have been named &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, but exchanged names with &quot;Foudroyant&quot; in March 1693 (before work on her began), and broken up 1714

====&quot;Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Ordinaire&quot;====
While the smaller First Rank ships also had three full-length gun decks, the uppermost of these before 1690 generally carried carriage guns only on the forward section and on the after section of that deck, with a section between them in the waist of the ship where no guns were mounted (and no gunports fitted). These ships had no forecastle or poop, so that the two sections of the upper gun deck served the function of forecastle and quarterdeck, while the nominal quarterdeck was short and served in effect the function of a poop.

All First Rank ships built from 1689 (until 1740) had three full-length gun decks, usually plus a number of smaller carriage guns mounted on the &quot;gaillards&quot; (i.e. the quarterdeck, forecastle and possibly a poop deck). Some of the earlier ships built before 1689 received extra guns and gunports fitted in the waist section of their upper deck around 1689, to bring them up to 80 guns or more.

*&quot;Vendôme&quot; 72, later 66 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched Spring 1651 at Brest) – classed as First Rank in 1669; renamed &quot;Victorieux&quot; in June 1671 but hulked in the following month and taken to pieces in 1679. In 1660 the 72-gun &quot;Vendôme&quot; was the sole ship which met the criteria of carrying more than 70 guns, and she retained this First Rank status in spite of being later reduced to fewer than 70 guns.
*&quot;Saint Philippe&quot; 78, later 84 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe Gédéon, launched 3 February 1663 at Toulon) – classed as 1st Rank in 1669; burnt by the English in the Battle of La Hogue in June 1692

===Second Rank Ships (&quot;vaisseaux de Deuxième Rang&quot;)===

Before 1670, the Second Rank consisted of ships of the line carrying from 50 up to 64 carriage guns (although there were exceptions); from 1671 this comprised ships of between 62 and 68 guns; in 1683 this was comprised ships carrying from 64 to 76 guns (again with exceptions), and by 1710 even 64-gun ships had been reduced to the Third Rate. Most Second Rank ships were two-decked vessels, i.e. carrying two complete gundecks, usually plus a few smaller carriage guns mounted on the &quot;gaillards&quot;; however, the Second Rank initially also included numerous ships nominally described as three-deckers (although all had a break in the 3rd tier of guns or &quot;upper deck&quot;) launched up until 1682, after which all three-deckers were First Rates; these three-deckers are listed below before the two-deckers.

===Third Rank Ships (&quot;vaisseaux de Troisième Rang&quot;)===

From 1670, the Third Rank was defined as ships of the line carrying from 40 up to 50 carriage guns; in 1671 this was redefined as ships carrying from 48 to 60 guns. Initially during the first part of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign these were designed and constructed as three-decked ships without forecastles and with minimal quarterdecks, although their upper decks were divided at the waist by an unarmed section of deck; but from about 1670 it was ruled that ships with fewer than 70 guns should not be built with three decks, so all subsequent Third Rank ships were two-decked vessels, i.e. carrying two complete gundecks, usually plus a few smaller carriage guns mounted on the &quot;gaillards&quot; (the quarterdeck and forecastle). During the first decade of the 18th century, the remaining Second Rank ships with 64 or fewer guns were down-graded (without change of armament) to Third Rank.

==Louis XV (1715 to 1774)==
(Great-grandson of Louis XIV) As Louis XV was only years old when he succeeded to the French throne, the first eight years of this reign were under the Regency of Philippe of Orléans, Duke of Chartres, the nephew of Louis XIV. 
While the five &quot;Rangs&quot; theoretically remained in existence, the construction by 1715 had crystallised around a number of distinct types, based on the number of carriage guns which they each carried.

===First Rank ships (&quot;vaisseaux de Premier Rang&quot;) in the Louis XV era===
====Three-decker type====
Only four three-decker ships were completed during this reign of nearly sixty years; a fifth was destroyed before completion.
*&quot;Foudroyant&quot; 110 (launched April 1724 at Brest) – condemned 1742 and taken to pieces 1742–43.
*&quot;Royal Louis&quot; 118 (built from 1740 at Brest but never launched – burnt by arson while still on the stocks there on 25 December 1742).
*&quot;Royal Louis&quot; 116 (launched May 1759 at Brest) – condemned September 1772 and taken to pieces 1773.
*&quot;Ville de Paris&quot; 90 (launched 19 January 1764 at Rochefort) – laid down as &quot;Impétueux&quot; in 1757, renamed January 1762. Enlarged to 104 guns in 1778-70, captured by the British at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782, sank in a storm on 19 September 1782.
*&quot;Bretagne&quot; 100 (later 110) guns. Designed by Antoine Groignard. (launched 24 May 1766 at Brest) – renamed &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; in October 1793, condemned and taken to pieces in 1796.
====Two-decker type: 80-gun ships (&quot;vaisseaux de 80&quot;)====
Large two-deckers, with a weight of broadside equal to the three-deckers of Louis XIV&#x27;s period, served usually as fleet flagships.
*&quot;Tonnant&quot; 80 (launched 17 November 1743 at Toulon, design by François Coulomb the Younger) – BU 1780
*&quot;Soleil Royal&quot; 80 (launched 30 June 1749 at Brest, design by Jaques-Luc Coulomb) – Driven ashore by the British and burnt at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759

*&quot;Languedoc&quot; 80 (launched 14 May 1766 at Toulon, designed by Joseph Coulomb) – Captured by the British at Toulon in August 1793, retaken by the French in December 1793. Renamed &quot;Anti-fédéraliste&quot; in April 1794, then renamed &quot;Victoire&quot; in May 1795, BU 1799
*&quot;Couronne&quot; 80 (launched May 1768 at Brest, designed by Antoine Groignard) – Accidentally burnt in April 1781 (later refloated and rebuilt – see below)

===74-gun ships (&quot;vaisseaux de 74&quot;) of the Louis XV era===
These formed overwhelmingly the core of the French battlefleet throughout the 18th century. Initially these carried just 26 guns – all 36-pounders – in their first (lower deck) battery and 28 guns in their second (upper deck) battery, with 16 guns on the &quot;gaillards&quot; (quarterdeck and forecastle) – the total of 74 guns being achieved by having 4 small guns (4-pounders) on the &#x27;dunette&#x27; (poop); this applied to twelve of the first thirteen vessels listed below. The exception in this group was the 70-gun &quot;Aimable&quot;, which – while having the same number of ports (except for the poop, where the 4-pounder guns on other ships were never included) – had only 24-pounders in its first (lower deck) battery. The 4-pounders were removed from the poop of all active units of this type by about 1750, reducing each to a 70-gun ship.
*&quot;Sceptre&quot; 74 (launched July 1720 at Brest, designed by Étienne Hubac) – taken to pieces in 1745.
*&quot;Bourbon&quot; 74 (launched September 1720 at Brest, designed by Laurent Helie) – foundered on 12 April 1741.
*&quot;Saint Philippe&quot; 74 (launched 1722 at Rochefort, designed by Pierre Masson, finished by Blaise Ollivier) – condemned 1745 and taken to pieces in 1746.
*&quot;Duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot; class. Four ships built at Toulon to a design by René Levasseur, 1719.
**&quot;Duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot; 74 (launched 13 August 1722 at Toulon) – hulked 1748 and taken to pieces in 1766.
**&quot;Phénix&quot; 74 (launched 17 March 1723 at Toulon) – taken to pieces in 1751.

*&quot;Neptune&quot; 74 (launched November 1723 at Brest, designed by Laurent Helie) – captured by the British in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre in October 1747

*&quot;Aimable&quot; 70 (launched August 1725 at Brest, designed by Laurent Hélie) – condemned 1735 and taken to pieces in 1736.
*&quot;Superbe&quot; 74 (launched 27 June 1738 at Brest, designed by Jean-Marie Helie the Younger) – foundered following the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759.
*&quot;Dauphin-Royal&quot; 74 (launched 13 October 1738 at Brest, designed by Blaise Ollivier) – condemned 1783 and hulked; taken to pieces in 1787.
From the &quot;Terrible&quot; (of 1739) onwards, the lengthened hulls of new ships meant that they could mount an extra pair of guns on the lower deck and another extra pair on the upper deck; the 4 small guns on the dunette were henceforth abolished. The consequent armament of 28 guns (36-pounders) in their lower deck battery and 30 guns (18-pounders) in their upper deck battery, with 16 guns on the &quot;gaillards&quot;, thus became the standard for the next 75 years. 
*&quot;Terrible&quot; 74 (launched 19 December 1739 at Toulon, designed by François Ollivier the Younger) – captured by the British in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre in October 1747 and added to the RN under the same name, BU in 1763

===64-gun ships (&quot;vaisseaux de 64&quot;) of the Louis XV era===
The 60 or 62 (later 64-gun) gun ship built from 1717 onwards continued the practice of similarly-armed vessels built in the first decade of the century.

<text>Mark Lenard (born Leonard Rosenson, October 15, 1924 – November 22, 1996) was an American actor, primarily in television. His most famous role was that of Sarek, father of Spock, in the science fiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, both in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and the animated series, in three films, and in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He also played a Klingon in &quot;Star Trek The Motion Picture&quot;, and a Romulan Commander in the episode Balance of Terror of the original series.

==Biography==
Lenard was born in Chicago, the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant, Abraham, and his wife, Bessie, and was raised in the small town of South Haven, Michigan, on Lake Michigan, where his family owned a tourist resort. He joined the United States Army in 1943 and trained to be a paratrooper during World War II; he did not see combat, and was discharged in 1946 as a technical sergeant.

He got his start on stage while in the army. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in theater and speech from the University of Michigan, he became known in New York City for serious drama, including the plays of Ibsen, Shaw, and Chekhov. His first noteworthy role was that of Conrad in John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In the mid-1960s, he moved his family to Los Angeles, where he played the recurring role of Dr. Ernest Gregory in &quot;Another World&quot;, and one of the Three Wise Men in the biblical epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965).

Lenard is best known for his appearances in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, particularly in the role of Sarek, the father of Spock (Leonard Nimoy). His first &quot;Star Trek&quot; appearance was in the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, however, playing the first Romulan ever seen in the series, in the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; (1966). He originated the character of Sarek in the second-season episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; (1967), and provided the voice of Sarek in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Yesteryear&quot; (1973). He later played an ill-fated Klingon Captain in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), which gave him the distinction of being the first actor to play a Romulan, a Vulcan, and a Klingon in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He reprised the role of Sarek in three of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films—&quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991)—and provided the voice of young Sarek in a brief flashback sequence in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989). Additionally, he appeared as the elderly Sarek in the third-season &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Sarek&quot; (1990) and the fifth-season episode &quot;Unification: Part 1&quot; (1991).

Lenard began acting in television series dramas and TV movies in 1955. He was the fifth actor to play Nathan Walsh in the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1959–1960). He played Dr. Ernest Gregory in &quot;Another World&quot; (1964–1965). For two seasons Lenard played Aaron Stempel in the television series &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; (1968–1970).

Lenard guest-starred in several episodes of the original &quot;&quot; from 1966 to 1970, including one with Leonard Nimoy, and in a two-part episode of &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.&quot; He played the prosecutor in Fort Grant in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968), and the hostile gorilla Urko in the television series &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. He made a guest appearance on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, in the episode &quot;Journey in the Spring, Part I&quot;, playing Peter Ingalls, older brother of Charles Ingalls. He had roles in &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; several times, including the episode &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (1968).

Lenard played a lead role in the film &quot;Noon Sunday&quot;, filmed on Guam with his costars Keye Luke; John Russell of the series &quot;Lawman&quot;; and character actor Stacy Harris. In &quot;The Radicals&quot; (1990), which recounted the beginnings of the Swiss Anabaptist movement in the 1520s, he played a composite historical character, Eberhard Hoffman, a Catholic bishop who serves as prosecutor in the trial of his former abbot Michael Sattler. In 1993, Lenard and fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor Walter Koenig toured in a production of &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot;. Lenard played a late middle-aged Huck Finn who re-encounters his childhood friend Tom Sawyer after a lifetime apart. Koenig played Sawyer.

Lenard died of multiple myeloma in New York City, New York, at the age of 72.

<text>The Wulfings, Wylfings or Ylfings (the name means the &quot;wolf clan&quot;) was a powerful clan in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Widsith&quot; and in the Norse sagas. While the poet of &quot;Beowulf&quot; does not locate the Wulfings geographically, Scandinavian sources define the Ylfings (the Old Norse form of the name) as the ruling clan of the Eastern Geats.

The Wulfings play an important role in &quot;Beowulf&quot; as Beowulf&#x27;s father Ecgþeow of the Wægmunding clan had slain one of its members, and was banished for not paying the weregild. The Danish king Hroðgar, who was married to Wealhþeow, a Wulfing woman, graciously paid the weregild, and when Beowulf arrived at the Danish court in order to slay Grendel, Hroðgar interpreted this as a son&#x27;s gratitude.

In Old Norse sources, the clan figure prominently in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and in &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, where Hjörvard and his son Hjörmund belong to it. It is also mentioned in the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot; and in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; where Eiríkr the Wise was one of its members. However, its most famous member was Helgi Hundingsbane who had two poems of his own (&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;), in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, and whose story is also retold in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.

Sam Newton and others (including Rupert Bruce-Mitford), have proposed that the East Anglian Wuffing dynasty was derived from the Wulfings, and it was at their court that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was first composed.

==Location==
According to the Norse sagas, the Wulfings ruled the Geatish petty kingdom of Östergötland.

In the first poem (&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;), Sinfjötli has his residence on the Brávellir (see Battle of the Brávellir).
Stanza 42:
Helgi Hundingsbane resides at Hringstaðir (probably modern Ringstad, an old royal estate on the same plain).

In the Heimskringla, Högni was the ruler of Östergötland. The legends of Helge Hundingsbane relate that Högni lost his throne to Helgi Hundingsbane. On the other hand, &quot;Sögubrot&quot; relates that Ivar Vidfamne gave the East Geatish throne to Hjörmund, the son of Hjörvard, after Ingjald&#x27;s death since it had been the kingdom of Hjörmund&#x27;s father Hjörvard.

:&quot;Hann setti konunga ok jarla ok lét ser skatta gjalda; han setti Hjörmund konung, on Hervardar Ylfings, yfir Eystra-Gautland, er átt hafði faðir hans ok Granmarr konungr&quot;.

However, this contradicts both the legend of Helge Hundingsbane and the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; in which the dynasty never lost Östergötland, unless Ivar killed either Högne or Helgi Hundingsbane before giving the throne to their relative Hjörmund.

<doc id="995318" wikidata="Q9988" url="?curid=995318" title="Jingtai Emperor">
<text>The Jingtai Emperor (21 September 1428 – 14 March 1457), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Daizong of Ming and by his posthumous name as the Emperor Jing of Ming, personal name Zhu Qiyu, was the seventh emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1449 to 1457. He succeeded his elder brother, Emperor Yingzong, who had been captured by the Mongols. He was overthrown in a palace coup led by Emperor Yingzong in February 1457 and died a month later.

In 1449, Emperor Yingzong, upon the suggestion of eunuch Wang Zhen, personally led the army to battle against the Mongolian army of Esen Taishi. However, in the Battle of Tumu Fortress, the Ming army was defeated and the emperor was taken captive. This event caused shock and concern throughout the government and the country. In response, the court eventually elevated the emperor&#x27;s brother, Zhu Qiyu—who had taken charge of government affairs during the campaign—to the throne. The former emperor, who had formed a positive relationship with Esen, was released in 1450 but did not regain his position. He was instead placed under house arrest in the Southern Palace of the Forbidden City.

During his reign, the Jingtai Emperor, with the support of prominent minister Yu Qian, worked to restore the country&#x27;s infrastructure. This included repairing the Grand Canal and the Yellow River&#x27;s dam system, resulting in economic prosperity and a bolstering of the country&#x27;s strength. After ruling for eight years, the emperor fell ill and his death was imminent in early 1457. He had not designated an heir, as his son and crown prince had died in the fourth year of his reign under unclear circumstances, possibly due to poisoning. Taking advantage of this situation, Emperor Yingzong seized control of the government in February 1457 through a palace coup. The Jingtai Emperor died a month later.

==Childhood and life as Prince of Cheng==
Zhu Qiyu, the future Jingtai Emperor, was born on 11 September 1428. He was the second son of the Xuande Emperor, who ruled the Ming dynasty from 1425 to 1435. When the Xuande Emperor died in 1435, his eldest son, Emperor Yingzong, became the new ruler of the Ming dynasty and created Zhu Qiyu as the Prince of Cheng.

As the Prince of Cheng, Zhu Qiyu was said to have lived in Shandong (present-day Wenshang County, Jining) as an adult. He was naturally shy, weak, indecisive and had no desire for power. He had a close relationship with his brother, which may have been the reason he remained in the capital, even though he was old enough to move to Wenshang in the latter half of the 1440s.

==Ascension==
In the summer of 1449, there was growing unrest along the northern border of the Ming dynasty. In late July, reports reached Beijing that the Mongols, under the leadership of their de facto ruler Esen, had launched an attack on Datong as part of a massive invasion. Emperor Yingzong decided to lead personally the campaign against the Mongols, with the support of his trusted advisor Wang Zhen.

On 3 August, Zhu Qiyu was appointed as the provisional administrator of Beijing. He was accompanied by aides who represented the most influential power groups. Prince Consort Commander Jiao Jing () represented the imperial family. Jin Ying, Director of Ceremonial and the highest-ranking eunuch in the absence of Wang Zhen, led the palace eunuchs. Minister of Personnel, Wang Zhi (), represented the government, and Grand Secretary Gao Gu () was the fourth aide. All major decisions were to be postponed until the emperor&#x27;s return.

On 4 August, Emperor Yingzong led his army into battle. Despite a month-long campaign, they achieved no results. On their return journey, the imperial army was unexpectedly attacked by the Mongols on 1 September at the Tumu post station. The Mongols were able to defeat and scatter the imperial army. Numerous high-ranking commanders were killed, and Emperor Yingzong himself was captured.

With the approval of Empress Dowager Sun, the mother of Emperor Yingzong, Zhu Qiyu assumed control of the government on 4 September, but the empress dowager made it clear that his authority was temporary and, on 6 September, named Zhu Jianshen, the two-year-old eldest son of Emperor Yingzong, as crown prince.

On 15 September, high-ranking civil and military officials, led by Yu Qian, petitioned the Empress dowager to install Zhu Qiyu as the new emperor in order to stabilize the government and improve relations with the Mongols by reducing the influence of the captured Emperor Yingzong. As the only adult relative of the captured emperor, Zhu Qiyu was seen as a natural choice. Initially, Zhu Qiyu rejected the proposal, but those around him saw this as a formality and he eventually accepted. On 17 (or possibly 22 or 23) September, he ascended the throne and adopted the era name Jingtai, which means &quot;exalted view&quot;. He also declared his brother as &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (; &#x27;Emperor Emeritus&#x27;), a title that was higher in rank but only honorary. Only one official objected to the new emperor&#x27;s accession and was punished with death.

After their victory at Tumu, the Mongols did not immediately launch an attack on Beijing, even though they would likely have been successful. Instead, they hesitated and allowed the Ming dynasty two months to recover from their defeat. During this time, the new Minister of War, Yu Qian, took charge of organizing the defense of Beijing and effectively became the leader of the government even before the new emperor was appointed. The Mongols did not approach the city until 27 October, but after four days of siege, they abandoned their efforts upon realizing they had no chance of victory.

The Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s government refused all of Esen&#x27;s attempts to pay for the release of the captured emperor and insisted on his unconditional return. The imprisoned emperor became a burden to the Mongols, so they eventually released him without any conditions. The Jingtai Emperor confined his brother to the Southern Palace and cut off all contact with government officials. His fear of his brother&#x27;s influence dominated the rest of his reign and influenced a cautious approach towards the Mongols.

==Government==
===Ministers, eunuchs and grand secretaries===

Traditional historians often praise the rule of the Jingtai Emperor, particularly when compared to the corrupt and inept eunuchs who had controlled the government in the previous decade, but the power did not completely transfer from eunuchs to officials during his reign. Eunuchs still held a considerable amount of influence. Instead, after 1449, both eunuchs and officials collaborated to revitalize the country.

To some extent, the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s regime followed the tradition of the three Grand Secretaries, who managed the empire from the mid-1420s to the early 1440s. This continuity was embodied by Wang Zhi, who held the position of Minister of Personnel from 1443 to 1457. During the 1440s, Wang Zhi was a constant opponent of Wang Zhen, but after 1449, he began to cooperate with Yu Qian. From 1451 to 1453, he was assisted in his duties by co-minister He Wenyuan, who was later replaced by Wang Ao. Yu Qian supported Wang Ao&#x27;s rise, and he successfully defended Liaodong, as well as later Guangdong and Guangxi. Wang Ao remained Minister of Personnel until his death in 1467 at the age of 73. The widely respected Ministers of Personnel, along with their careful selection of capable officials, contributed to a high level of administration in the third quarter of the fifteenth century.

The ministers of the Jingtai Emperor typically held their positions for extended periods of time. The ministers of Revenue, Jin Lian (); Rites, Hu Ying (); Justice, Yu Shiyue (); and Works, Shi Pu (), all served throughout his reign. The leadership of the Censorate, Chen Yi (), then Yang Shan (), Wang Wen (), Xiao Weizhen (), and Li Shi (), remained constant from 1445 to 1454. Additionally, army commander Shi Heng () and eunuchs Cao Jixiang () and Liu Yongcheng () also held their positions throughout this time.

Some of the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s key supporters were the eunuchs Jin Ying and Xing An. Jin Ying held significant influence in the 1430s but eventually lost power to Wang Zhen. During the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s reign, he was appointed as Director of Ceremonial but was later imprisoned in 1450 for backing the return of Emperor Yingzong. Xing An then took over as head of the eunuchs and played a crucial role in negotiating the return of Emperor Yingzong and the change of the crown prince in 1452. Two other eunuch generals, Cao Jixiang and Liu Yongcheng, were instrumental in the military reform of 1453. However, prominent officials such as Grand Secretaries Chen Xun () and Gao Gu did not support the Jingtai Emperor.

Despite having a stable personnel, the ruling group was not free from controversy. In 1451–1452, Yu Qian, the most influential figure in Beijing, had a heated conflict with Shi Heng over the abuse of power and corruption by Shi Heng and his family. The emperor was unable to resolve the dispute until Yu Qian fell ill in 1454–1455, causing him to lose much of his influence.

===Military reforms===
In 1451, once the immediate danger had passed, Yu Qian initiated military reform. He handpicked 100,000 soldiers from the remaining troops in the Beijing area and divided them into five training divisions (; &quot;Tuanying&quot;). In 1452, he added an additional 50,000 soldiers and created ten training units. He also restructured the command system of the capital garrison. Initially, command was divided between generals and eunuchs, with each of the Three Great Camps (for infantry, cavalry, and firearms) operating independently under its own field commander, but there was little coordination between detachments from different camps. Yu Qian placed each camp under one field commander and the entire garrison under the field marshal. He also removed the eunuchs from their supervisory role, resulting in a unified command and a greater involvement of the capital generals in managing the training camps. This new arrangement of the drill camps was unique among the various Ming command systems, as the generals in charge of training also commanded the same soldiers in battle.

After 1449, the practice of hiring soldiers for wages from the peasant and urban population became more widespread due to the shortage of men and the inefficiency of many hereditary soldiers. These hired soldiers were referred to as &quot;bing&quot; (), in contrast to the hereditary soldiers known as &quot;jun&quot; ().

After Emperor Yingzong regained power in 1457, Yu Qian was executed and his reforms were reversed.

===Economy===
In 1450, Shandong experienced a famine, and from 1452 to 1454, the provinces in northern China and the lower Yangtze River were greatly affected by heavy rains and cold weather. The drought of 1455 was followed by summer rains in 1456 in northern China. The state treasury was depleted due to providing aid to the population and dealing with tax arrears.

In 1453, the ban on using coins for trade was lifted. From the mid-1450s, illegal private coins from Jiangnan began to dominate the markets in Beijing, replacing the old Yongle coins. Although there were some proposals to address this problem by resuming state production, they were disregarded, resulting in the spread of illegal mints through unofficial networks.

After the severe floods and changes in its course in 1448, the government took urgent action to regulate the Yellow River. As a result, the river began to flow into the sea both north and south of the Shandong Peninsula, but these changes in the river&#x27;s flow caused problems with the water supply for the Grand Canal. Despite attempts to fix the issue and repairs carried out from 1449 to 1452, they were ultimately unsuccessful. In 1453, Xu Youzhen (), who had fallen out of favor during the crisis of 1449 when he suggested relocating the capital from Beijing to Nanjing, presented a plan to rebuild the levees and canals. With a workforce of 58,000, he completed complex repairs to the dams and excavated hundreds of kilometers of canals within two years. His work successfully withstood the great flood of 1456 and remained in use for decades.

Traditional history portrays the 1450s as a time of intense competition between two imperial brothers, but Marxist historians emphasize the presence of class conflicts. The population was consistently dissatisfied, leading to rebellions and keeping the army occupied for much of the decade. By 1452, the uprisings in Fujian and Zhejiang had subsided. In Guangdong and Guangxi, the lawlessness of non-Chinese populations (specifically the Miao and Yao tribes) went unchecked until Wang Ao was sent to the region in 1452–1453. In 1450–52, the Miao and Yao rebelled in Guizhou and Huguang, and unrest continued in Fujian, Huguang, Sichuan, and Zhejiang in the years 1453–56. Throughout the 1450s, there were armed conflicts in Guangdong, where the authorities mobilized loyal tribes against the rebels. Non-Han Chinese groups generally rebelled against the Ming government, while Han Chinese miners and landless individuals in the peripheral regions of the provinces remained relatively calm.

Overall, the reign of the Jingtai Emperor was marked by successful reforms and the restoration of stability, thanks to the efforts of capable ministers. In the field of culture, the Jingtai era is known for the advancement of wire enamel (cloisonné) decoration, which is now referred to as &quot;Jingtai-lan&quot; (; meaning &#x27;blue [color of the era] Jingtai&#x27;) in Chinese.

==Succession problems, deposition and death==
One ongoing political issue during the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s reign was the situation of Emperor Yingzong and the matter of who would succeed him. Despite being isolated, Emperor Yingzong still had allies within the government, including Minister of Rites Hu Ying. Typically, the emperor&#x27;s adversaries would have been forced to resign, but the Jingtai Emperor was hesitant to address these issues and allowed them to remain in their positions.

Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s eldest son, Zhu Jianshen, was the crown prince since 1449. However, the Jingtai Emperor eventually decided to reserve the throne for his own descendants. Through a combination of bribery and intimidation, he was able to gain enough support for his plan. On 20 May 1452, despite opposition from the Grand Secretaries and other officials, he created Zhu Jianshen as the Prince of Yi and his son Zhu Jianji as the new crown prince. On the same day, Empress Wang was removed from her position and replaced by the mother of the heir, Lady Hang. This move, which appeared to prioritize personal interests, weakened the emperor&#x27;s authority.

Zhu Jianji died in 1453 and his mother in 1456. As the emperor had no other son, a new crown prince was not chosen. Some officials, including Zhang Lun (; d. 1483), Director of the Ministry of Rites, and Zhong Tong (; d. 1455), a censor, suggested reinstating Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s eldest son, but they were imprisoned for their suggestion. Zhong Tong and others were even flogged to death. This event sparked the ambition of courtiers and government officials to conspire in favor of Emperor Yingzong.

The plot was orchestrated by Shi Heng, Cao Jixiang, Xu Youzhen, and Zhang Yue (; 1393–1458). They saw an opportunity when the emperor fell ill at the end of 1456, causing him to cancel audiences and New Year ceremonies in 1457. The request for the appointment of a successor went unanswered, and the court was filled with anxiety as they prepared for the emperor&#x27;s death. On the morning of 11 February 1457, the conspirators forcefully removed Emperor Yingzong from his residence and placed him on the throne, surprising officials who had come for the morning audience. Emperor Yingzong wasted no time in making changes to the government, promoting the conspirators and dismissing officials from the previous regime. Some supporters of the Jingtai regime, including Yu Qian, Wang Wen, and three high-ranking eunuchs, were executed.

The Jingtai Emperor was demoted to the Prince of Cheng and never fully recovered from his illness. He died on 14 March 1457. There is speculation that he may have been murdered. He was given the posthumous name Li (; &#x27;Rebel&#x27;) and was buried outside the imperial mausoleums at Yuchuanshan. Some officials suggested abolishing his era name, similar to the abolishment of the Jianwen era, but Emperor Yingzong did not agree. In 1475, the Chenghua Emperor restored his imperial title and changed the posthumous name to Emperor Gongren Kangding Jing (), which was shorter than the names given to other emperors. In the mid-17th century, Zhu Yousong (the Hongguang Emperor), the first ruler of the Southern Ming dynasty, gave him the temple name Daizong ().

==Family==
After the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s death, his concubines were ordered to commit suicide. However, the deposed Empress Wang was allowed to continue living outside the palace, allegedly under the protection of her nephew, who had regained his position as heir and later became the Chenghua Emperor. He even allowed her to keep her possessions. Emperor Yingzong later had her house searched and confiscated 200,000 &quot;liang&quot; of silver and other treasures. Empress Wang died in January 1507 and was given the posthumous name Empress Zhenhui Jing (). She was buried in her husband&#x27;s mausoleum.

The Jingtai Emperor also had a daughter (two according to &quot;History of Ming&quot;), Princess Gu&#x27;an (), who was born in 1469. She was married to Wang Xian (; d. 1514), a great-grandson of Wang Zhi.
Consorts and issue:
* Empress Xiaoyuanjing, of the Wang clan (; 1427–1507)
** Princess Gu&#x27;an (; 1449–1491), first daughter
*** Married Wang Xian () in 1469, and had issue (one son)
** &quot;Second daughter&quot;

<text>The Tartan Army are fans of the Scotland national football team. They have won awards from several organisations for their friendly behaviour and charitable work. They have also been criticised at times for aspects of their behaviour, however, such as indecent exhibitionism and jeering at &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

== History ==

Tartan is part of the symbolic national dress of Scotland, and the name Tartan Army first came into common usage in the 1970s, to describe the &quot;well-refreshed hordes&quot; who would stand on the terracings at Hampden Park, or biannually at Wembley for the England match. Scotland fans were criticised at that time for their hooliganism, particularly after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the 2–1 win against England in 1977.

Two years later, 349 arrests were made and a further 144 fans were ejected from Wembley Stadium during the 1979 British Home Championship match, mainly for drunk and disorderly behaviour and vandalism. The behaviour in that latter match prompted the Scottish Sports Minister Alex Fletcher to apologise to colleagues and led to the creation of the Scotland Travel Club.

The Scotland Travel Club was established in 1980 with the expressed purpose of encouraging responsible behaviour by fans. It has been suggested by Professor Eric Dunning that the improvement in behaviour arose mainly from a desire to look better than the English fans, who experienced significant problems with hooliganism during the 1980s and 1990s. The Tartan Army have won a number of awards for their vocal support and friendly nature.

The organisation of the Travel Club had an immediate impact, with the Scotland matches at the 1982 FIFA World Cup being played in a &quot;family atmosphere&quot;. The Tartan Army were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship and also received an award for their behaviour at the 1998 World Cup in France. BBC News described the Scotland fans as &quot;one of the highlights&quot; of that World Cup, noting their colourful appearance.

Matches against England, which used to be played on an annual basis as part of the British Home Championship, were eventually stopped after 1989 due to violence and organised hooliganism. Both matches that were played between the countries in November 1999 in qualification for UEFA Euro 2000 had associated problems. Strathclyde Police made 230 arrests in connection with the tie played at Hampden, while trouble at the second leg in Wembley resulted in 56 supporter injuries and 39 arrests. Police spokesmen downplayed the incidents after both games, however.

Comments after the first game indicated that the arrests were for minor public order offences and that the scale of violence witnessed was lower than a typical Friday evening in Glasgow. The Metropolitan Police adopted a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach for the second game, but the number of arrests was &quot;comparatively small&quot; and the &quot;vast majority&quot; of supporters were well behaved.

===21st century===
The Tartan Army were awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee after a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier in Brussels. The fans had been praised by the mayor of Zagreb for their behaviour after a match against Croatia in the same competition.

In April 2002, during the joint bid by Scotland and Ireland to host the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell cited the &quot;worldwide reputation&quot; of the Tartan Army as a strength of the bid, stating that other countries welcome their arrival &quot;with open arms&quot;. In 2005, the Scotland Travel Club became the Scotland Supporters Club, with sections for younger fans being established. Membership had grown to 17,000 by this time. The UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign saw membership numbers increase dramatically to a capacity of 27,500, with a waiting list of over 10,000. The Scotland Supporters Club is operated by the Scottish Football Association, with membership guaranteeing one match ticket for all home fixtures and offering the opportunity to apply for away match tickets. As of August 2010, the club was at its maximum capacity of 35,000 members and did not accept new applications.

In August 2008, Irish Football Association chief executive Howard Wells criticised jeering from Scottish supporters during the British National Anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, before a friendly international match against Northern Ireland. The SFA, who had pleaded with fans not to jeer the anthem, admitted that they were also &quot;disappointed&quot; by the booing. The Scottish Government also criticised the Tartan Army, commenting that it had &quot;tarnished&quot; their reputation. Scotland were not punished for the booing because the match was a friendly, which fell outside the jurisdiction of UEFA. The British anthem was used by Scotland until the 1970s, but it was replaced by &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; and subsequently &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, due to consistent booing at matches. This issue recurred when Scotland played Liechtenstein in September 2010, as their national anthem uses the same tune as the British anthem. SFA acting chief executive George Peat publicly apologised for a section of the fans jeering the anthem. The British anthem was again booed by Scotland fans when the team played Northern Ireland in the 2011 Nations Cup, and England in a September 2023 friendly.

The Tartan Army has been a consistent opponent of the concept of a Great Britain team, particularly its participation in the 2012 Olympic Games, due to concerns that such participation would endanger the separate status of Scotland within international football.

Scotland qualified for UEFA Euro 2020, their first major finals since the 1998 World Cup. The tournament was spread around Europe, meaning that two of three group stage games were played at Hampden Park, but over 20,000 Scotland fans travelled to London for the game against England. This was despite Scotland only being allocated 2,600 tickets, due to COVID-19 restrictions.

== Composition ==
Research carried out in 1996 noted that the proportion of the Tartan Army comprising Rangers supporters, &quot;traditionally the backbone of the Tartan Army&quot;, had declined since the 1980s. However, Rangers still provided the single largest proportion with 21%, while west-of-Scotland Catholics, traditionally associated with Celtic, were still notably under-represented. Politically, the Scottish National Party enjoyed the support of almost two in five Tartan Army members.

== Charitable work ==
The Tartan Army received a nomination in the inaugural International Scot Award, as part of &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Scottish Politician of the Year ceremony, for their charitable work. The Tartan Army Children&#x27;s Charity (TACC) and Tartan Army Sunshine Appeal (TASA) are both registered Scottish charities run by Scotland fans, raising money for disadvantaged children in Scotland and in the countries visited by fans following the team.

The Sunshine Appeal was first launched after Scotland&#x27;s away fixture against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo in September 1999 during UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying, when a group of Scotland fans, who had traveled despite the Foreign Commonwealth Office discouraging travel in the wake of the Bosnian War, were introduced to Kemal Karic, a local boy who had lost his leg in the shelling of Sarajevo. TASA&#x27;s aim is to make a donation in every country where Scotland play a game, which they have done since 2003.

TACC has donated funds to projects for disabled and blind children in Ukraine, Georgia and North Macedonia. In 2009, £30,000 was donated to each of two projects in South Africa, where the Tartan Army had hoped to visit for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The TACC, which is the nominated charity of the SFA, also organise trips for disadvantaged Scottish children to watch Scotland play at Hampden Park. TACC&#x27;s main fundraising events are a lottery monthly lottery and the TACC Kiltwalk, an annual 26-mile sponsored walk from Hampden Park to Loch Lomond.

== Music ==

In 2007, the Tartan Army joined Scottish folk-rock band Runrig to record a version of &quot;Loch Lomond&quot;, christened the Hampden Remix, for BBC Children in Need. The song peaked at #9 on the UK Singles Chart and at #1 in Scotland. in April 2022, their recording was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales and streams exceeding 200,000 units.

== Official tartan ==
Prior to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ian and Alan Adie, two Glasgow businessmen, trademarked the name &quot;Tartan Army&quot; in 1997. They approached the Scottish Tartans Authority to assist in creating a tartan. Keith Lumsden designed the corporate tartan on their behalf and it was registered on 1 March 1997 under number 2389 with both the Scottish Tartans Authority (STA) and the Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR).

It is mostly Balmoral Blue and Torea Bay , with Freedom Red , Gainsboro White , and Golden Poppy .

The Scottish Tartans Society notes that the design was taken originally from Royal Stewart and modified having Black Watch added as a background. It was first seen in common use at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
==&quot;Away with the Tartan Army – Scotland&#x27;s Best Moments&quot;==

In June 2021, the BBC produced a documentary hosted by &quot;Off the Ball&quot;&#x27;s Stuart Cosgrove and Tam Cowan counting down the top 10 great Scotland supporting memories ranked by a group of journalists, pundits and former players and including interviews with Tartan Army members.

<doc id="995327" wikidata="Q1590915" url="?curid=995327" title="Devadasi">
<text>In India, a devadasi is a female artist who is dedicated to the worship and service of a deity or a temple for the rest of her life. The dedication takes place in a ceremony that is somewhat similar to a marriage ceremony. In addition to taking care of the temple and performing rituals, these women also learn and practice classical Indian dances such as Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam, Kuchipudi, and Odissi. Their status as dancers, musicians, and consorts was an essential part of temple worship.

Between the sixth and thirteenth centuries, Devadasis had a high rank and dignity in society and were exceptionally affluent as they were seen as the protectors of the arts. During this period, royal patrons provided them with gifts of land, property, and jewellery. After becoming Devadasis, the women would spend their time learning religious rites, rituals and dances. Devadasis were expected to live a life of celibacy.

During the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent, kings who were the patrons of temples lost their power, thus the temple artist communities also lost their significance. As a result, Devadasis were left without their traditional means of support and patronage and were now commonly associated with prostitution. The practice of Devadasi was banned during British rule, starting with the Bombay Devadasi Protection Act in 1934. The colonial view of Devadasi practices remains debated as the British colonial government were unable to distinguish the Devadasis from non-religious street dancers.

The Devadasi system is still in existence in rudimentary form, but under pressure from social activism at different times, some state governments have outlawed it, such as Andhra Pradesh with its 1988 Devdasis (Prohibition of Dedication) Act and Madras with its 1947 Devdasis Act.

==History==
The practice became significant when one of the great queens of the Somavamshi dynasty decided that in order to honour the gods, certain women who were trained in classical dancing, should be married to the deities. The inception of the practice was one that was imbued with great respect as the women who were chosen to become &quot;devadasi&quot; or “Devidasi”
were subject to two great honors: first, because they were literally married to the deity, they were to be treated as if they were the goddess Lakshmi herself, and second, the women were honored because they were considered to be &quot;those great women who (could) control natural human impulses, their five senses and [could] submit themselves completely to God.&quot; As they were married to an immortal, the women were considered to be auspicious. Their main duties, in addition to committing to a life without marriage (to a mortal, in the common, popular sense), were to take care of a temple and learn classical Indian dances, usually the Bharatanatyam, which they would perform at temple rituals. Patrons were considered to have higher status for their ability to financially sponsor Devadasis.

According to temple worship rules, or Agamas, dance and music are the necessary aspects of daily puja for temple deities. Devadasis were known by various local terms such as &quot;Basavi&quot; in Karnataka, &quot;Matangi&quot; in Maharashtra, and &quot;Kalavantin&quot; in Goa and Damaon. Devadasis were also known as &quot;Jogini&quot;, &quot;Venkatasani&quot;, &quot;Nailis&quot;, &quot;Muralis&quot; and &quot;Theradiyan&quot;. Devadasi is sometimes referred to as a caste (varna); however some question the accuracy of this usage. &quot;According to the devadasi themselves there exists a devdasi &#x27;way of life&#x27; or &#x27;professional ethic&#x27; (vritti, murai) but not a devadasi jāti (sub-caste). Later, the office of devdasi became hereditary but it did not confer the right to work without adequate qualification&quot; (Amrit Srinivasan, 1985). In Europe the term &quot;bayadere&quot; (from , from , literally &quot;dancer&quot;) was occasionally used.

===Ancient and medieval period===
The definite origin of the Devadasi or Devidasi tradition is murky due to its early inception. The first known mention of a Devadasi is to a girl named Amrapali, who was declared Nagarvadhu by the king during the time of the Buddha. Many scholars have noted that the tradition has no basis in scriptures. A. S. Altekar states that, &quot;the custom of association of dancing girls with temples is unknown to &quot;Jataka&quot; literature. It is not mentioned by Greek writers, and the Arthashastra, which describes in detail the life of &quot;Ganika&quot;, is silent about it.&quot;

The tradition of female artists in temples is said to have developed during the 3rd century CE. A reference to such dancers is found in the Meghadūta of Kālidāsa, a classical poet and Sanskrit writer of the Gupta Empire. An example of reference to a Devadasi in the 3rd century CE in South India is Madhavi found in the Silappadikaram. Other sources include the works of authors such as Xuanzang, a Chinese traveller, and Kalhana, a Kashmiri historian. An inscription dated to the 11th century suggests that there were 400 &quot;Devadasis&quot; attached to the Thanjavur temple in South India. Similarly, there were 500 &quot;Devadasis&quot; at the &quot;Someshvara&quot; shrine of Gujarat. Between the 6th and 13th centuries, &quot;Devadasis&quot; had a high rank and dignity in society and were exceptionally affluent as they were seen as the protectors of the arts. During this period royal patrons provided them with gifts of land, property, and jewellery.

====Devdasis in South India and the Chola Empire and Vijayanagara Empire====

The Chola empire supported the Devadasi system; in Tamil Devadasis were known as &quot;Devar Adigalar&quot; (&quot;Deva&quot; means &quot;Divine&quot; and &quot;Adigalar&quot; &quot;Servants&quot;, i.e. &quot;Servants of the Divine&quot;). Both male and female Devadasas and Devadasis were dedicated to the service of Hindu temples and their deities. The Chola empire developed the tradition of music and dance employed during temple festivals.

Inscriptions indicate that 400 dancers, along with their gurus and orchestras, were maintained by the Brihadisvara temple, Thanjavur, with munificent grants including the daily disbursement of oil, turmeric, betel leaves, and nuts. Nattuvanars were the male accompanists of the Devadasis during their performances. The Nattuvanars conducted the orchestra while the Devadasi performed her service. Inscriptions indicate that Nattuvanars taught the Chola queen and princess Kundavai.

As the Chola empire expanded in wealth and size, more temples were built throughout the country. Soon other empresses and emperors started imitating the Chola empire and adopted Devadasi systems of their own.

Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes who visited Vijayanagara Empire in 16th century describes the presence of Devadasis in the empire. 

===Natavalollu===
A community of Karnataka living in Andhra Pradesh, the &quot;Natavalollu&quot; were are also known as &quot;Nattuvaru&quot;, &quot;Bogam&quot;, &quot;Bhogam&quot;, and &quot;Kalavanthulu&quot;.

It was customary in the Krishna district of Tenali for each family to give one girl to the Devadasi system. These dancers were known as &quot;Devadasis&quot;. As part of a social reform, a written agreement was made to formally end the practice.

&quot;Ādapāpas&quot; were female attendants to the ladies of the families of Zamindars. Ādapāpas were not allowed to marry. In some places such as the Krishna and Godāvari districts, Ādapāpas were known as &quot;Khasa&quot; or &quot;Khasavandlu&quot;.

&quot;Natavalollu&quot;/&quot;Kalawants&quot; were a community that was distributed throughout the state of Andhra Pradesh. They were also referred to as &quot;Devadasi&quot;, &quot;Bogamvallu&quot;, &quot;Ganikulu&quot;, and &quot;Sani&quot;. &quot;Kalavantulu&quot; means one who is engaged in art. Davesh Soneji writes that, &quot;By the early twenty-first century, large numbers of women in the Kalavanthulu community had converted to Christianity, because this promised them a stable monthly income as members of the new rehabilitation programs of these missions.&quot;

==== Mahari Devadasi of Odisha ====
In the eastern state of Odisha Devadasis were known colloquially as Maharis of the Jagannath temple complex. The term &quot;Devadasi&quot; referred to the women who danced inside the temple. Devadasi, or mahari, means &quot;those great women who can control natural human impulses, their five senses and can submit themselves completely to God (Vachaspati)&quot;. Mahari is a contraction of &quot;Mahan Nari&quot;, translating to, &quot;the woman belonging to God&quot;. Chaitanya had defined Devadasis as &quot;Sebayatas&quot; who served God through dance and music. Pankaj Charan Das, the oldest guru of Odissi classical dance and who comes from a Mahari family, defines Mahari as &quot;Maha Ripu-Ari&quot;, one who conquers the six main ripus – enemies.

Unlike other parts of India, the Odia Mahari Devadasis were never sexually liberal and were expected to remain celibate upon becoming Devadasis. However, there are records of Odia Mahari Devadasi having relationships and children. It is said that the daughters of the Maharis of the Jagannath temple took to other professions such as nursing in the mid-20th century due to stigma attached to their inherent profession, as dance was frowned up during the colonial era.

The 1956 Orissa Gazette lists nine Devadasis and eleven temple musicians. By 1980, only four Devadasis were left – Harapriya, Kokilaprabha, Parashmani, and Shashimani. By 1998, only Shashimani and Parashmani were still alive. The daily ritualistic dance had stopped, although Shashimani and Parashmani served in a few of the yearly temple rituals such as &quot;Nabakalebara&quot;, &quot;Nanda Utsava&quot;, and &quot;Duara Paka&quot; during &quot;Bahuda Jatra&quot;. The last of the Devadasis, Shashimani, died on 19 March 2015, at the age of 92.

====Yellamma Cult of Karnataka in South India====
In the southern Indian state of Karnataka the Devadasi system was practiced for over 10 centuries. Chief among them was the Yellamma cult.

There are many stories about the origin of the Yellamma cult. The most popular story indicates that Renuka was the daughter of a Brahmin, who married the sage Jamadagni, and was the mother of five sons. She used to bring water from the Malaprabha river for the sage&#x27;s worship and rituals. One day at the river she saw a group of youths engaged in water sports and forgot to return home in time for her husband&#x27;s worship and rituals, which made Jamadagni question her chastity. He ordered their sons one by one to punish their mother, but four of them refused on one pretext or the other. The sage cursed them to become eunuchs and had Renuka beheaded by his fifth son, Parashurama. To everybody&#x27;s astonishment, Renuka&#x27;s head multiplied by tens and hundreds and moved to different regions. This miracle inspired her four eunuch sons as well as others to become her followers and worship her head.

===Colonial era===

====Reformists and abolitionists====
Reformists and abolitionists considered the Devadasi a social evil due to their way of life, which had very widely degenerated into a system of prostitution. The first anti-Nautch and anti-dedication movement began in 1882, even though the British colonial authorities officially maintained most brothels in India. The Irish missionary Amy Carmichael was active in helping Devadasi women to escape their situation.

In later period the devadasis were equated with prostitutes and their children were again given away to temples. Stigma was attached to a particular caste of devadasis and they were seen as prostitutes. After a certain age they were left to fend for themselves.

As the Devadasi were equated with prostitutes, they also became associated with the spread of the venereal disease syphilis in India. During the British colonial period many British soldiers were exposed to venereal diseases in brothels, and Devadasis were misunderstood to be responsible. In an effort to control the spread of venereal disease the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves. Devadasis were required to register, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soneji 2012 https://archive.org/details/unfinishedgestur00sone/page/n126 112&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to obligatory registration, the British Government also established institutions known as Lock Hospitals where women were brought in order to be treated for venereal diseases. However, many of the women admitted to these hospitals, including many Devadasi, were identified through the registry and then forcibly brought to the hospitals. A number of these women were confined in the hospitals permanently.

Today, Sitavva Joddati of Karnataka helps former Devadasi find a foothold in mainstream society. In 1982 she was made a Devadasi at age seven. In 1997 she began the non-governmental organisation MASS (Mahila Abhivrudhi-Samrakshana Sansthe) in the Belagavi district of Ghataprabha to help women like her escape the Devadasi system and live a life of dignity. Between 1997 and 2017 MASS helped over 4,800 Devadasis reintegrate into mainstream society. In 2018 she received the Padmashri award at age 43.

====Evolution of Bharatanatyam====
Rukmini Devi Arundale, a theosophist trained in ballet, sought to re-appropriate the Devadasi dance traditions in a context perceived respectably by Indian society which had by then adopted the western morales. She altered the dance repertoire to exclude pieces perceived as erotic in their description of a deity. She also systematized the dance in a way that incorporated the extension and use of space associated with dance traditions such as ballet. The product of this transformation was a new version of Bharatanatyam, which she taught professionally at the &quot;Kalakshetra&quot; school she established in Madras. Bharatanatyam is commonly seen as a very ancient dance tradition associated with the Natyashastra. However, Bharatanatyam as it is performed and known today is actually a product of Arundale&#x27;s recent endeavour to remove the Devadasi dance tradition from the perceived immoral context associated with the Devadasi community and bring it into the upper caste performance milieu. She also adopted a lot of technical elements of ballet into the modified form of Bharatanatyam. To give the dance form a measure of respect E Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale proposed a resolution at a 1932 meeting of the Madras Music Academy to rename &quot;Sadirattam&quot; to &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; or Indian dance.

===Legislative Initiatives===
The first legal initiative to outlaw the Devadasi system dates back to the 1934 Bombay Devadasi Protection Act. This act pertained to the Bombay province as it existed in the British Raj. The Bombay Devadasi Protection Act made dedication of women illegal, whether consensual or not. In 1947, the year of Indian independence, the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act outlawed dedication in the southern Madras Presidency. The Devadasi system was formally outlawed in all of India in 1988, although social and economic pressures on mostly Dalit families have ensured that the Devadasi system is still widely practiced illegally.

==Devadasi practices==

From the late medieval period until 1910, the Pottukattu or &quot;tali-tying&quot; dedication ceremony, was a widely advertised community event requiring the full cooperation of the local religious authorities. It initiated a young girl into the Devadasi profession and was performed in the temple by a priest. In the Hindu tradition, marriage is viewed as the only religious initiation (&quot;diksha&quot;) permissible to women. Thus, the dedication was a symbolic &quot;marriage&quot; of the pubescent girl to the temple&#x27;s deity.

In the &quot;sadanku&quot; or puberty ceremonies, the Devadasi initiate began her marriage with an emblem of the god borrowed from the temple as a stand-in bridegroom. From then onward, the Devadasi was considered a &quot;nitya sumangali&quot;, a woman eternally free from the adversity of widowhood. She would then perform her ritual and artistic duties in the temple. The puberty ceremonies were not only a religious occasion, but also a community feast and celebration in which the local elites also participated.

===Odisha===
The 1956 Orissa Gazette references Devadasis dances. They had two daily rituals. The &quot;Bahara Gaaunis&quot; would dance at the &quot;Sakaala Dhupa&quot;. After breakfast Lord Jagannatha would give Darshana to the &quot;bhaktas&quot; (the devotees). In the main hall, a Devadasi, accompanied by musicians and the Rajaguru (the court guru), would dance standing near the Garuda stambha (pillar). They would perform only pure dance, and could be watched by the audience. The &quot;Bhitara Gaunis&quot; would sing at the &quot;Badashinghara&quot;, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. At bedtime, Lord Jagannatha would first be served by male Sebayatas, who would fan him and decorate him with flowers. After they left, a &quot;Bhitara Gaauni&quot; would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijaya), sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. Later she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and the guard would close the main gate.

==Social status==
A Devadasi was believed to be immune from widowhood and was called &quot;akhanda saubhagyavati&quot; (&quot;woman who never separated from good fortune&quot;). Since she was wedded to a divine deity, she was supposed to be one of the especially welcome guests at weddings and was regarded as a bearer of good fortune. At weddings, people would receive a string of the &quot;tali&quot; (wedding lock) prepared by her, threaded with a few beads from her own necklace. The presence of a Devadasi on any religious occasion in the house of a dvija member was regarded as sacred and she was treated with due respect, and was presented with gifts.

==Contemporary statistical data==
Indian National Commission for Women, which is mandated to protect and promote the welfare of women, collected information on the prevalence of Devadasi culture in various states. The government of Odisha stated that the Devadasi system is not prevalent in the state. In March 2015, Sasimani Debi, the last devadasi attached to Jagannath temple, died thus bringing the curtain down on the institution.

Similarly, the government of Tamil Nadu wrote that this system has been eradicated and there are now no Devadasis in the state. Andhra Pradesh has identified 16,624 Devadasis within its state. The Karnataka State Women&#x27;s University found more than 80,000 Devadasis in Karnataka in 2018; while a government study found 40,600 in 2008. The government of Maharashtra did not provide the information as sought by the commission. However, the state government provided statistical data regarding the survey conducted by them to sanction a &quot;Devadasi Maintenance Allowance&quot;. A total of 8,793 applications were received and after conducting a survey 6,314 were rejected and 2,479 Devadasis were declared eligible for the allowance. At the time of sending the information, 1,432 Devadasis were receiving this allowance.

According to a study by the Joint Women&#x27;s Programme of Bangalore for National Commission for Women, girls who have to accept becoming a Devadasi, few reasons were provided, which included dumbness, deafness, poverty, and others. The life expectancy of Devadasi girls is low compared to the average of the country, it is rare to find Devadasis older than fifty.

<doc id="995332" wikidata="Q2731762" url="?curid=995332" title="Teicoplanin">
<text>Teicoplanin is an semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. It is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;.

Teicoplanin is widely available in many European, Asian, and South American countries, however it is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is not commercially available in the United States. Teicoplanin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name Targocid. Other trade names include Ticocin marketed by Cipla(India).

Its strength is considered to be due to the length of the hydrocarbon chain.

==History==
Teicoplanin was first isolated in 1978 from &quot;Actinoplanes teichomyceticus&quot; (ATCC 31121), a rare species of actinobacteria in the family &quot;Micromonosporaceae&quot;. The bacteria were obtained from a soil sample collected in Nimodi Village, Indore, India. The chemical structure of teicoplanin was determined and published in 1984.

Teicoplanin was first introduced into clinical use in 1984. Following the publication of studies demonstrating its efficacy against infections such as bone and soft tissue infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, and sepsis in 1986, it received regulatory approval in Europe in 1988.

The biosynthetic pathway leading to teicoplanin, as well as the regulatory circuit governing the biosynthesis, were studied intensively in recent years, allowing for the creation of an integrated model of its biosynthesis.

== Indications ==
Teicoplanin treats a wide range of infections with Gram-positive bacteria, including endocarditis, sepsis, soft tissue and skin infections, and venous catheter-associated infections.

Studies have investigated the use of oral teicoplanin in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea, finding it to demonstrate efficacy comparable to that of vancomycin.

=== Susceptible organisms ===
Teicoplanin has demonstrated &quot;in vitro&quot; efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci (including MRSA), streptococci, enterococci, and against anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria including Clostridium spp. Teicoplanin is ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria as the large, polar molecules of the compound are unable to pass through the external membrane of these organisms.
The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens:
* &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;: 0.06 μg/ml - 0.5 μg/ml
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;: ≤0.06 μg/ml - ≥128 μg/ml
* &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;: ≤0.06 μg/ml - 32 μg/ml

== Pharmacology ==
===Pharmacokinetics===
Due to poor oral absorption, teicoplanin requires intravenous or intramuscular administration for systemic effect. Intramuscular administration achieves approximately 90% bioavailability. The drug exhibits high protein binding (90-95%) and is primarily eliminated through the kidneys unchanged, with minimal liver metabolism (2-3%) via hydroxylation. Clearance is reduced in patients with kidney impairment and is not significantly removed by hemodialysis. Teicoplanin exhibits a long half-life of 45-70 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing after loading doses.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) terminus of the peptidoglycan precursor, preventing the transpeptidation reaction necessary for cell wall cross-linking. This binding also interferes with the polymerization of peptidoglycan, ultimately leading to cell death.

In addition to its binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus, teicoplanin may also interact with the lipid II substrate in the bacterial cell membrane through its hydrophobic tail. This interaction could facilitate the antibiotic&#x27;s proximity to the nascent peptidoglycan, enhancing its inhibitory effect. However, this mechanism has not been fully confirmed.

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects of teicoplanin are usually limited to local effects or hypersensitivity reactions. While there is potential for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, the incidence of such organ toxicity is rare if recommended serum concentrations are successfully maintained.

== Considerations ==
Reduced kidney function slows teicoplanin clearance, consequently increasing its elimination half-life. Elimination half-life is longer in the elderly due to the reduced kindey function in this population.

== Chemistry ==
Teicoplanin (TARGOCID, marketed by Sanofi Aventis Ltd) is actually a mixture of several compounds, five major (named teicoplanin A2-1 through A2-5) and four minor (named teicoplanin RS-1 through RS-4).
All teicoplanins share a same glycopeptide core, termed teicoplanin A3-1 — a fused ring structure to which two carbohydrates (mannose and &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine) are attached. The major and minor components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety — β--glucosamine — and differ only by the length and conformation of a side-chain attached to it. Teicoplanin A2-4 and RS-3 have chiral side chains while all other side chains are achiral. Teicoplanin A3 lacks both the side chains as well as the β--glucosamine moiety.

The structures of the teicoplanin core and the side-chains that characterize the five major as well as four minor teicoplanin compounds are shown below.

Teicoplanin refers to a complex of related natural products isolated from the fermentation broth of a strain of &quot;Actinoplanes teichomyceticus&quot;, consisting of a group of five structures. These structures possess a common aglycone, or core, consisting of seven amino acids bound by peptide and ether bonds to form a four-ring system. These five structures differ by the identity of the fatty acyl side-chain attached to the sugar. The origin of these seven amino acids in the biosynthesis of teicoplanin was studied by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The studies indicate amino acids 4-Hpg, 3-Cl-Tyr, and 3-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine are derived from tyrosine, and the amino acid 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (3,5-Dpg) is derived from acetate. Teicoplanin contains 6 non-proteinogenic amino acids and three sugar moieties, &quot;N&quot;-acyl-β-D-glucosamine, &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and D-mannose.

=== Gene cluster ===

The study of the genetic cluster encoding the biosynthesis of teicoplanin identified 49 putative open reading frames (ORFs) involved in the compound&#x27;s biosynthesis, export, resistance, and regulation. Thirty-five of these ORFs are similar to those found in other glycopeptide gene clusters. The function of each of these genes is described by Li and co-workers. A summary of the gene layout and purpose is shown below.

=== Heptapeptide backbone synthesis === 
The heptapeptide backbone of teicoplanin is assembled by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) TeiA, TeiB, TeiC and TeiD. Together these comprise seven modules, each containing a number of domains, with each module responsible for the incorporation of a single amino acid. Modules 1, 4, and 5 activate L-4-Hpg as the aminoacyl-AMP, modules 2 and 6 activate L-Tyr, and modules 3 and 7 activate L-3,5-Dpg. The activated amino acids are covalently bound to the NRPS as thioesters by a phosphopantetheine cofactor, which is attached to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain. The enzyme bound amino acids are then joined by amide bonds by the action of the condensation (C) domain.

The heptapetide of teicoplanin contains 4 D-amino acids, formed by epimerization of the activated L-amino acids. Modules 2, 4 and 5 each contain an epimerization (E) domain which catalyzes this change. Module 1 does not contain an E domain, and epimerization is proposed to be catalysed by the C domain. In all, six of the seven total amino acids of the teicoplanin backbone are composed of nonproteinogenic or modified amino acids. Eleven enzymes are coordinatively induced to produce these six required residues. Teicoplanin contains two chlorinated positions, 2 (3-Cl-Tyr) and 6 (3-Cl-β-Hty). The halogenase Tei8* has been acts to catalyze the halogenation of both tyrosine residues. Chlorination occurs at the amino acyl-PCP level during the biosynthesis, prior to phenolic oxidative coupling, with the possibility of tyrosine or β-hydroxytyrosine being the substrate of chlorination. Hydroxylation of the tyrosine residue of module 6 also occurs &quot;in trans&quot; during the assembly of the heptapeptide backbone.

=== Modification after heptapeptide backbone formation ===

Once the heptapeptide backbone has been formed, the linear enzyme-bound intermediate is cyclized. Gene disruption studies indicate cytochrome P450 oxygenases as the enzymes that performs the coupling reactions. The X-domain in the final NRPS module is required to recruit the oxygenase enzymes. OxyB forms the first ring by coupling residues 4 and 6, and OxyE then couples residues 1 and 3. OxyA couples residues 2 and 4, followed by the formation of a C-C bond between residues 5 and 7 by OxyC. The regioselectivity and atropisomer selectivity of these probable one-electron coupling reactions has been suggested to be due to the folding and orientation requirements of the partially crossed-linked substrates in the enzyme active site. The coupling reactions are shown below.

Specific glycosylation has been shown to occur after the formation of the heptpeptide aglycone. Three separate glycosyl transferases are required for the glycosylation of the teicoplanin aglycone. Tei10* catalyses the addition of GlcNAc to residue 4, followed by deacetylation by Tei2*. The acyl chain (produced by the action of Tei30* and Tei13*) is then added by Tei11*. Tei1 then adds a second GlcNAc to the β-hydroxyl group of residue 6, followed by mannosylation of residue 7 catalysed by Tei3*.

== Research ==
Researchers have explored the potential of teicoplanin as an antiviral agent against various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory studies indicate that teicoplanin inhibits cathepsin L, a host cell protease utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry via the endocytic pathway. In vitro experiments have demonstrated teicoplanin&#x27;s ability to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, with reported IC50 values in the low micromolar range. This suggests potential efficacy against various SARS-CoV-2 variants due to conserved cathepsin L cleavage sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Animal studies have also shown a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection with teicoplanin pre-treatment.

<text>New Jazz Conceptions is the debut album by jazz pianist Bill Evans, recorded in two sessions during September 1956 for Riverside Records.

==Background==
Evans was playing a gig with his old friend, the guitarist Mundell Lowe, who had been recording for the newly emerging independent jazz label Riverside. Lowe played a demo tape featuring Evans over the phone to Riverside producer Orrin Keepnews and his partner, Bill Grauer, who were sufficiently impressed that they resolved to catch Evans playing live. After hearing him at the Village Vanguard several times, they offered him a recording contract at scale wages. Keepnews had some trouble persuading Evans to recordan ironic situation, as &quot;usually, of course, it is the artist trying to persuade the producer.&quot;

The album was recorded in two sessions on September 18 and 27, 1956. Evans played three extremely brief solos: Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;I Got It Bad (and That Ain&#x27;t Good),&quot; Richard Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;My Romance,&quot; which would remain an integral part of Evans&#x27;s repertoire and be recorded by him many times in trio settings, and the original version of his own most widely recognized and recorded composition, &quot;Waltz for Debby.&quot;

On the album, these solos were interspersed among eight trio recordings featuring bassist Teddy Kotick and drummer Paul Motian, both of whom Evans had been playing with in Tony Scott&#x27;s quartet. Motian would go on to become a member of Evans&#x27;s classic 19591961 trio with Scott LaFaro. The trio recordings included three more originals by Evans: &quot;Five,&quot; &quot;Displacement,&quot; and &quot;No Cover, No Minimum,&quot; the first of which would become a regular part of his repertoire for the rest of his career. Like many jazz tunes, &quot;Five&quot; is based on the chord changes of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; and, unusually for Evans, it has an angularity reminiscent of the compositions of Thelonious Monk; pianist Warren Bernhardt, a close friend of Evans, noted that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to play.

&quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot; was Evans&#x27;s sixth recording project overall, and he wouldn&#x27;t allow himself to be coaxed back into the studio as a leader for another 27 months, for the seminal follow-up &quot;Everybody Digs Bill Evans&quot;. In the meantime, he continued to develop his personal style as a sideman, recording with such important contemporaries as George Russell, Charles Mingus, Helen Merrill, Miles Davis, Michel Legrand, Cannonball Adderley, and Art Farmer.

==Reception==

Although a critical success that gained positive reviews in &quot;DownBeat&quot; and &quot;Metronome&quot; magazines, &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot; was initially a financial failure, selling only 800 copies the first year.

Writing for AllMusic, music critic Scott Yanow said about the album: &quot;Bill Evans&#x27; debut as a leader found the 27-year-old pianist already sounding much different than the usual Bud Powell-influenced keyboardists of the time. ... A strong start to a rather significant career.&quot; Conversely, David Rickert of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; noted the apparent influence of Powell and wrote, &quot;Even at this stage he had the chops to make this a good piano jazz album, but in the end it&#x27;s not a very good Bill Evans album. ... There are glimpses of the later trademarks of Evans&#x27; style.&quot;

Evans biographer Keith Shadwick comments that the album &quot;conclusively demonstrated Evans to be a highly competent and sophisticated modern jazz pianist with a definite compositional gift, but also showed him to be considerably short of a unified musical personality. It would be no coincidence that he would not make another album as a leader for close on two-and-a-half years.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot; was digitally remastered and released on CD by Riverside/Original Jazz Classics in 1987 with an alternative version of &quot;No Cover, No Minimum&quot; as a bonus track. Riverside reissued it with 20-bit K2 super coding in 2004.

<doc id="995334" wikidata="Q357281" url="?curid=995334" title="Viv Anderson">
<text>Vivian Alexander Anderson (born 29 July 1956) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right-back. He is best known for his ten-year stint with Nottingham Forest, with whom he won the First Division title in 1978, as well as the European Cup in 1979 and 1980.

In 1978, he became the first black footballer to play for England&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s national team, and from 1980 to 1988, was selected in the England squad for four major tournaments. He also had a short-lived managerial career with Barnsley, before joining Middlesbrough as assistant manager to Bryan Robson, where he remained until 2001.

== Early life ==
Anderson was born in Clifton, Nottingham. His parents, Audley and Myrtle, were both from Jamaica. Audley came to England in 1954, while Myrtle arrived in 1955. Despite the racial tensions at the time, Anderson has said his childhood was relatively untroubled by discrimination and his parents must take a lot of credit for protecting him from the worst excesses of the environment they lived in. He spent a year as a schoolboy with Manchester United before being released. He returned to Nottingham where at school he sat and passed three CSEs. He then worked for three weeks as a silkscreen printer that he described as 

== Club career ==
=== Nottingham Forest ===
Anderson had broken into the Nottingham Forest team during 1974 and became a regular after the arrival of Brian Clough as manager of the East Midlands club, then in the Second Division, in January 1975. He was part of the side that won promotion to the First Division in 1977, winning the title, along with the League Cup, a year later.

Anderson was one of the first black players to represent top English clubs at the time, and regularly suffered racial abuse from fans of rival teams. He was regularly pelted with bananas and targeted with racist chants.

Anderson was part of the Forest team that retained the League Cup (though he missed the final through injury) and then clinched the European Cup in 1979 with victory over Malmö. He picked up his second European Cup winners&#x27; medal when they retained the trophy with victory over Hamburger SV in Madrid. Forest did reach a third successive League Cup final that year, but lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Additionally, the 1980 European Cup win was to prove to be their last trophy for nine years.

=== Arsenal ===
In the summer of 1984, he aimed to revive his career with a move to Arsenal for £250,000. His time at Arsenal saw the club develop from underachieving in the First Division, to enjoying a victory over Liverpool in the 1987 League Cup final, and he finally enjoyed some club success for the first time in seven years since the European Cup. He also scored a vital goal against rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the second leg of the semi-final. He scored 15 goals in his three seasons at Highbury, a spell that saw him make 150 appearances for the club. Much of Arsenal&#x27;s upturn in fortunes at this time can be attributed to George Graham&#x27;s arrival in May 1986. The side was built upon a strong defence whose training involved being connected with rope to ensure they learned to work together. At this time, Anderson provided much inspiration to the young Tony Adams. The 30-year-old Anderson was rewarded with a three-year contract offer from Arsenal at the end of the 1987 season. Arsenal expected Anderson to agree to the new deal but he instead signed with Manchester United, the same club who had released him as a teenager.

=== Manchester United ===
After a tribunal agreed £250,000 fee, he became Alex Ferguson&#x27;s first signing since taking over as manager of Manchester United. At Old Trafford, Anderson was a significant part of Ferguson&#x27;s rebuilding plans as he attempted to create a title-winning side to end the wait that had started at the club in 1967. Following a dismal start to the 1986–87 season that had cost Ron Atkinson his job on 5 November, Ferguson had steered United from 21st to 11th of 22 First Division clubs in the final six months of the campaign. In the 1987–88 season, United finished second in the league, nine points behind Liverpool.

Anderson remained first-choice right-back in the 1988–89 season, but United had a slow start to the season and despite an upturn in their form in the new year that saw them climb to third place by mid-February. They finished in 11th place. Despite finishing 13th in the league in the 1989–90 season, United won the FA Cup – but Anderson was not in the squad for the final.

Anderson&#x27;s hopes of winning his place back in the 1990–91 season were crushed when Ferguson paid Oldham Athletic £625,000 for Denis Irwin, who quickly established himself as the first-choice right-back, while Ince switched back to central midfield. He played just three more games for the club, and on his final appearance for them in the League Cup second round, second leg against Halifax Town on 10 October 1990, he scored their first goal in a 2–1 win that gave a 5–2 aggregate victory.

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Anderson joined Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer in January 1991, helping them to promotion from the Second Division, although he missed the League Cup final triumph over Manchester United as he had played for his old club earlier in the competition. Despite originally being thought of as a short-term signing, Anderson established himself in the Wednesday first team and captained the side on many occasions. He played an active part in the &quot;Owls&quot; team that finished third in the 1991–92 First Division and seventh in the first season of the Premier League. He also helped Wednesday reach the FA Cup and League Cup final in 1993, but they were on the losing side to Arsenal in both finals.

== International career ==

Anderson made his debut for England in November 1978, for a friendly against Czechoslovakia. He became the third non-white footballer to represent the men&#x27;s senior England team after Paul Reaney (who had first appeared for England in 1968) and Frank Soo (who appeared for England during wartime). Coach Ron Greenwood was insistent that no political issue was at stake, despite the ever-rising number of young black stars in the game, born and raised in England. His second cap was in a friendly against Sweden in June 1979. His third appearance was his first competitive international as England defeated Bulgaria 2–0 at Wembley in a qualifier for the 1980 European Championships.

England had duly got through to the European Championship finals in Italy and Anderson was named in Greenwood&#x27;s squad, playing in the final group game against Spain as a replacement for Phil Neal. England won 2–1 but did not progress further. Anderson later made his World Cup qualifying debut in a qualifier for the 1982 competition in a 4–0 win over Norway.

Injury to Kevin Keegan had meant Greenwood needed to call upon an experienced club captain to lead the team out in Spain, so Ipswich Town&#x27;s skipper Mick Mills, normally a left-back, was put in the right-back slot (with regular incumbent Kenny Sansom remaining on the left) and both Neal and Anderson missed out. Neal played against Kuwait in the final group game to rest Mills when qualification had already been assured, but Mills returned for the second phase, from which England were eliminated. Anderson, meanwhile, never kicked a ball.

Anderson&#x27;s England career seemed to be stalling. After the World Cup and Greenwood&#x27;s departure, he did not feature at all under new coach Bobby Robson until 1984, with Neal still mainly getting the nod. England failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championships during this period. Anderson finally won an 11th cap, in April 1984, almost two years after his tenth.

After his move to Arsenal, Anderson revitalised his international standing and he won six consecutive caps from 1984 and into 1985, including four qualifiers for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico; in the first of which he scored his first of his two international goals in an 8–0 victory over Turkey. Then Robson gave a debut to the young Everton right-back Gary Stevens. Anderson won three caps at the end of 1986 as England began their quest to qualify for the 1988 European Championships in Germany. In one of the qualifiers against Yugoslavia, Anderson scored his second and final international goal.

Meanwhile, Stevens had forced his way back in as England qualified for the European Championships and Anderson won his 30th and (what proved to be) final cap in a Rous Cup game against Colombia though was again in reserve when the squad went to Germany for the finals. They lost all three group games and Stevens came in for criticism, but maintained his place. For the third time, Anderson had travelled to a major international competition without getting a minute on the pitch. Robson began to look to the younger end of the playing spectrum for competition for Stevens, and Anderson&#x27;s international career ended.

== Coaching career ==
=== Barnsley ===
In June 1993, Anderson left Hillsborough to be appointed player-manager of Barnsley, following the departure of Mel Machin. In his first season at Oakwell, Barnsley narrowly avoided relegation to Division Two.

=== Middlesbrough ===
At the end of the 1993–94 season, Anderson quit Barnsley after just a year to become assistant manager of Middlesbrough under former Old Trafford teammate Bryan Robson.

Despite retiring from playing football in 1994, Anderson was still officially registered as a player and following an injury crisis at Middlesbrough he played two games for the club in the 1994–95 season, when they were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions. After gaining promotion, he finally hung up his playing boots.

Anderson helped Robson assemble a side that reached both domestic cup finals (both of which they lost) in the 1996–97 season, although they were relegated due to a three-point deduction for postponing a December fixture at late notice as a result of so many players being unable to play due to illness or injury. However, &quot;Boro&quot; won promotion at the first attempt and were League Cup runners-up once again. Robson and Anderson left Middlesbrough in June 2001, after surviving a further relegation scare. Anderson has not been employed in football since leaving the assistant manager&#x27;s job at Middlesbrough.

== Personal life ==
Anderson has three children with his ex-wife. He was awarded an MBE in January 2000, and was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2004 in recognition of his impact on the English league.

As of 2005, Anderson ran a sports travel agency and also works as a goodwill ambassador for the Football Association. Anderson appears as an occasional guest pundit on MUTV, Manchester United&#x27;s official TV station.

Anderson is set to auction off more than 100 shirts, as well as his medals, in October 2024. This includes the shirt he wore on his on his debut match against Czechoslovakia in 1978 which had previously been displayed at the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester.

<text>The Three Mills are former working mills and an island of the same name on the River Lea. It is one of London’s oldest surviving industrial centres. The mills lie in the London Borough of Newham, but despite lying on the Newham side of the Lea, access is principally from the western, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, side of the river.

The River Lea Tidal Mill Trust Ltd owns the House Mill and the Miller&#x27;s House buildings, which are used for educational projects and as conference spaces. The Lower Lea Project is also based at Three Mills in The Miller&#x27;s House.

==History==
It is thought that there were eight or possibly nine mills on the River Lea in Stratford at the time of the Domesday Book, though this number may refer to the number of pairs of millstones rather than buildings. These are the earliest recorded examples of a tidal mill system. In the clock mill there were 16 workers.

Stratford Langthorne Abbey, founded in 1135, acquired Three Mills some time in the 12th or 13th centuries, and the local area became known by the name. By the time Henry VIII dissolved the abbey in the 1530s, the mills were grinding flour for the bakers of Stratford-atte-Bow, who were celebrated for the quality of their bread and who supplied the huge City of London market.

In 1588, one of the mills was described as a &quot;gunpowder mill&quot;. During the 16th century the three mills were reduced to two (which today are the House Mill and the Clock Mill). In the 17th century, the mills were used to grind grain, which was then used to distill alcohol; the mills became a major supplier to the alcohol trade and gin palaces of London.

The House Mill was built in 1776 (and after a fire destroyed it, quickly rebuilt) by Daniel Bisson. It is a grade I listed building. The Clock Mill was rebuilt by Philip Metcalfe between 1815 and 1817 incorporating the old clock, and an older bell. There was also a windmill which survived until about 1840. The House Mill continued to operate until 1940 and the Clock Mill until 1952.

Ownership changed relatively frequently during the 17th to the late 19th centuries, until 1872 when it was purchased by gin distillers J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co of Clerkenwell. Initially producing Lamplighter Gin on site, the company eventually moved production of all of their brands to the site. Distilling ceased in 1941 during the rationing shortages of World War II. The Nicholson family, headed by Sir Richard Nicholson, sold the business to the Distillers Company. 

Three Mills sustained severe air-raid damage during the Second World War. The Miller&#x27;s House was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt in 1995 with a modern interior and rear part, but retaining the original facade. Three Mills was used for bottling and warehousing by Bass Charrington and Hedges &amp; Butler. The latter, one of the oldest wine merchants in Britain located their main working offices at Three Mills. Here, Bacardi was bottled and a large portfolio of wines and spirits was marketed.

The House Mill remains the largest tidal mill in the world, although the water wheels are currently not in operation. The building is owned by The River Lea Tidal Mill Trust Ltd and is open to visitors on Sunday afternoons during the summer. It is one of only four Grade I listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham.

The creation of the Three Mills Lock on the Prescott Channel and the Three Mills Wall River Weir, for the 2012 Summer Olympics construction work, has created a head of water behind the mill. This may mean that it can be operated again although it has partially removed the tidal benefits of the site.

The Clock Mill is the temporary site of Harris Science Academy East London.

In 2017, J&amp;W Nicholson re-launched the gin brand which was launched in 1736 as Nicholson Gin.

==Three Mills Island==

Three Mills Island is in Bromley-by-Bow in east London. It forms part of the 50-mile Lea Valley Walk.

The Prescott Channel, a former flood relief channel passes to the east, making the land an island. The mills share Three Mills Island with the 3 Mills Studios, a 10-acre film and TV studio, which makes a large number of major films and television programmes and an open green and play area called Three Mills Green.

The 26-acre area of land opposite the mills, shown in historical surveys as the Three Mills District, once housed a large cooperage producing barrels to support the mills, as well as a wide range of industries, from the manufacture of innovative inks to sugar refining. Called Sugar House Island, the development is being delivered by Vastint and is expected bring 2,500 jobs to the area, with a new business district as well as waterside homes and amenities. Construction is estimated for completion in 2024.

== Operation ==

In 1878 there were seven waterwheels at Three Mills. Most of them were around 20 ft in diameter and 3 ft in width, but one was 8 ft in width. There were four in the House Mill and three in the Clock Mill. They drove fourteen pairs of millstones and produced a total of 150 HP (112KW). The average output of the House Mill was about 2 tons of maize and 5 tons of barley per tide rising to 10 and 14 tons respectively on spring tides. The average weekly throughput of the two mills was 125 tons per week.

Clock Mill was powered by three iron undershot water wheels, two of 6.1m diameter and one of 5.9m diameter. These wheels drove six pairs of millstones at 130 revolutions per minute. This mill operated until 1952. When the mills were both operating in 1938, the site employed one millwright and four carpenters. During the daily 7–8 hours of tidal power, the water wheels ran at 16 revolutions per minute with a working head of 3.0-3.7m. This produced some 7-9 kW to turn each millstone.

<doc id="995343" wikidata="Q2846767" url="?curid=995343" title="Andrew Watson (footballer, born 1856)">
<text>Andrew Watson (24 May 1856 – 8 March 1921) was a Scottish footballer who is widely considered to be the first black person to play association football at international level. He played three matches for Scotland between 1881 and 1882. Arthur Wharton was previously commonly thought to be the first black player, as he was the first black professional footballer to play in the Football League, but Watson&#x27;s career predated him by over a decade. There is evidence that Watson was paid professionally when at Bootle in 1887, two years prior to Wharton becoming a professional with Rotherham Town; however, the Merseyside club did not play in the Football League at the time Watson played there.

==Early life and education==
Watson was the son of a wealthy Scottish sugar planter Peter Miller Watson (1805–1869) (the son of James Watson, of Crantit, Orkney, Scotland) and a local British Guianese woman named Hannah Rose. He came to Britain with his father, and his older sister Annetta, and they inherited a substantial amount when their father died in London in 1869.

He was educated at Heath Grammar School in Halifax, West Yorkshire and then from 1871 at King&#x27;s College School, in Wimbledon, London, where records show he excelled at sports including football. He later studied natural philosophy, mathematics and engineering at the University of Glasgow when he was 19, where his love of football blossomed. He played in the full-back position, on either the right or the left flank.

==Early life, marriages, children==
Watson left Glasgow University after one year and in 1877 became a partner in Watson, Miller, and Baird, a wholesale warehouse business in Glasgow. In November 1877 he married Jessie Nimmo Armour (1860–1882), the daughter of John Armour, a cabinet-maker. Their son Rupert Andrew was born in 1878, and a daughter Agnes Maude in 1880. Watson moved to London with his family in the summer of 1882 for work reasons. His wife died in the autumn of 1882 and their two children returned to Glasgow to live with their grandparents.

He returned to Glasgow and married for a second time, to Eliza Kate Tyler (1861–1949) in February 1887. She was the daughter of Joseph Tyler, East India merchant. Later that year he moved to Liverpool, where he worked on ships and sat exams to qualify as a marine engineer. Watson and Eliza had two children, a son Henry Tyler in 1888 and a daughter Phyllis Kate in 1891.

Through his father he was related to William Ewart Gladstone, who served four terms as British Prime Minister during the late 19th century, and likely also related to the 21st-century English poet Malik Al Nasir through his mother.

==Football career==
===Club career===
After first playing for Maxwell in 1876, Watson signed for local side Parkgrove, where he was additionally their match secretary, making him the first black administrator in football. At Parkgrove he played alongside another black player, Robert Walker.

Watson also took part in athletics competitions, winning the high jump on several occasions.

On 14 February 1880, Watson was selected to represent Glasgow against Sheffield at Bramall Lane, an annual fixture played between 1874 and 1960; Glasgow won 1–0. He was also selected for a tour to Canada in the summer of 1880 which was cancelled after the death of William Dick, secretary of the Scottish Football Association.

In April 1880, Watson also signed for Queen&#x27;s Park – then Britain&#x27;s largest football team – and became their secretary in November 1881. He led the team to two consecutive Scottish Cup wins in 1881 and 1882, thus becoming the first black player to win a major competition.

Watson&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Scottish Football Association Annual&quot; of 1880–81 reads as follows:

Watson, Andrew: One of the very best backs we have; since joining Queen&#x27;s Park has made rapid strides to the front as a player; has great speed and tackles splendidly; powerful and sure kick; well worthy of a place in any representative team.

In 1882, Watson moved to London and became the first black player to play in the English Cup when he turned out for Swifts. In 1883, he was the first foreign player to be invited to join the leading amateur club in England, the Corinthians. His time there included an 8–1 victory against Blackburn Rovers, who were at that time the English Cup holders. He also played for other amateur English clubs, including Pilgrims, Brentwood, and London Caledonians. As one of the &#x27;Scotch Professors&#x27; of the age who introduced a more sophisticated and effective passing game into England where individualistic dribbling had previously been used, Watson was described by the founder of the Scottish Football Museum in a 2021 report as &quot;the most influential black footballer of all time. There is nobody that comes close&quot;.

The colour of his skin was of no significance to his peers, and there is no specific historical record of racism on the part of the Scottish Football Association, although in an 1885 profile, mention was made of him &quot;On more than one occasion being subjected to vulgar insults by splenetic, ill-tempered players&quot;. One match report is more interested in Watson&#x27;s unusual brown boots rather than the customary black boots of that time. As written in the minutes, before one match where Watson was injured and unable to play, an SFA vice-president said if Watson had been fit he would have happily drugged a fellow Scottish international to give Watson his place. He played his last match for Queen&#x27;s Park in 1886.

Paul McDonald, writing for the BBC, noted: &quot;Payments to players had been made legal in England in 1885 and professional footballers were paid decent salaries for that time. Ironically this attracted many Scottish players southwards to ply their trade in England, whereas in Scotland the game remained, in theory anyway, an amateur game until 1893.&quot;

====Professionalism====
In 1886 and 1887, the English club Bootle advertised for players in Scotland, as the Scotch Professors innovation of the modern passing game took hold in England. Several Scottish players were enticed to relocate by the offer:- Tom Veitch (Dumbarton), Campbell (Moffat), Frank Woods (Moffat), Robert Anderson (Dumbarton), Billy Hastings (Airdrieonians) among others. It was later found by a SFA committee investigating a Scottish player, Robert Calderwood, who returned north - he obtained a new job in Cowlairs offering 30 shillings per week, and subsequently turned out for Cowlairs F.C. - that he received a wage of 26 shillings per week from Bootle F.C.. The SFA found Calderwood guilty of professionalism and he was banned for two years, but they found that Cowlairs F.C. played the player unknowingly and they were merely ordered to replay a match against Third Lanark.

Watson also signed for Merseyside club Bootle in 1887. Bootle offered wages and signing fees to a number of players, and research by Tony Onslow outlined in &quot;The Forgotten Rivals. A History of Bootle Football Club&quot; indicates that Watson &quot;was&quot; paid professionally. This means that Watson&#x27;s professional career would predate the professional career of Arthur Wharton, who was previously considered to be the first black footballer to play professionally.

Onslow writes that Watson was Bootle&#x27;s star signing and that the club &quot;pulled off the biggest coup in Merseyside&quot; by signing the Scotland international player. It is not known exactly how much Watson was paid by the Merseyside club, but as their star signing he would have doubtless commanded more than the 26 shillings per week offered to Calderwood, who was similarly a Scotland international player.

When Bootle was drawn with a Smethwick side Great Bridge Unity F.C., the Midlands club received a telegram from a &#x27;Smith of Oakfield&#x27; who stated that Bootle&#x27;s Watson and another Scottish player Robert Anderson were being paid – and as such should be ineligible for their tie. Watson and others were in the Bootle side that beat Unity 2–1; and so, directly after the match, Unity lodged a complaint with the F.A. The F.A. announced that they would let Bootle proceed to the next round, but they would instead launch an investigation into the club.

Onslow writes:

Bootle Football Club now faced a local FA committee on charge of paying a certain number of their players. Dr. Morley of Blackburn, President of the northern branch, chaired the meeting that took place at the Crompton Hotel in Liverpool. Also present was Morton P. Betts from the London executive and all the prominent members of the Liverpool and District F.A. committee. Former Bootle players [Robert] Izatt and [John] Weir were called to give evidence before the adjourned and referred the matter to London.

Both Robert Izatt and John Weir were Scottish players (formerly from Third Lanark) also signed by Bootle. Weir was a Scotland international, having just been capped that year. Much to the annoyance of Bootle, both players moved on from the club shortly after signing and moved on to Everton, who at the time were Bootle&#x27;s main rivals in Merseyside.

The club was found guilty by the FA but the punishment was lenient – they had that same season closed Anfield for a month when Everton similarly paid players – and Bootle escaped with a mere caution. The new Everton players John Weir and Robert Izatt - alongside Everton&#x27;s other Scotch Professors of Dick, Watson, Goudie, Cassidy, and Murray - were all deemed as professional players and had their registrations suspended.

The payment of Watson, Anderson, Calderwood and others at the club also explains the investigations of the local Bootle newspaper into the club&#x27;s finances. Around the start of the 1887–88 season, &quot;The Bootle Times&quot; was asking questions into the club&#x27;s finances, trying to work out who was getting what. It also, in passing, takes a dig at Bootle F.C.&#x27;s reliance on Scottish players by its phrasing of &#x27;own local club, if indeed we may call it that&#x27;, hinting that the newspaper suspected the payments made to the club&#x27;s Scottish players were indeed where the club&#x27;s &quot;financial surplus&quot; went. The payments to Scotch Professors around Merseyside would have been common knowledge.

The Saturday 1 October 1887 edition noted:

QUESTIONS WHICH REQUIRE ANSWERS. In Bootle and other places the football season has commenced in right earnest. Our own local club, if indeed we may call it that, has started has well; 9 games have already played which have proved to be of the most interesting character to those who taken interest in such pastimes. [...] First and foremost comes the &quot;profit and loss account&quot; of the club in question, and this is a very interesting item. Saturday after Saturday the ground is simply crowded with spectators, all of whom, with the exception of the subscribers, pay 3d. gate money. Last Saturday week, taking the figure from a Liverpool contemporary, we find that upwards of 5,000 persons on the field, and last Saturday there must have at least 4,000. Bring them together and we have 9,000 people upon the football field in two weeks. Nine thousand people at 3d. per head, would bring a gate of over £112. £112 to be raised in a fortnight by one club is no small sum, and it augurs well for the popularity of the game in Bootle, and the result of this season&#x27;s play. [...] If, for the sake of argument, we place the length of the football season at eight months, and consider that the &quot;gates&quot; will average 1,000 persons each week, we shall thus conclude that at least £800 - £1000 will be taken in one year. Of course this money is not all clear profit. From it has to be deducted travelling and various other expenses incidental to a club of the standing of the Bootle Football Club; but we venture to assert that after all claims have been met a large surplus must remain. What, then, we require to know, is Where does this surplus go? If it were possible to obtain a balance sheet of the club, it would not be necessary to ask these questions. We have applied for a balance sheet upon more than one occasion, but the request has been met by one excuse or another, to the effect that no balance sheet was printed. 

The 15 October 1887 edition of &quot;The Bootle Times&quot; notes: &quot;the questions asked of us a fortnight ago with reference to the working and management of the club have not been answered.&quot;

===International career===
Watson won three international caps for Scotland. His first cap came against England in London on 12 March 1881, in which he captained the side. Scotland won 6–1, which (as of 2024) is still a record home defeat for England. A few days later, Scotland played Wales and won 5–1, Watson captaining Scotland again.

Watson&#x27;s last cap came against England in Glasgow on 11 March 1882. This was a 5–1 victory again to Scotland. Watson moved to London in the summer of 1882, which effectively ended his international career as the SFA only picked players based in Scotland at this time.

The next non-white person to receive a full international cap for Scotland was Paul Wilson in 1975. The next black person selected to play for Scotland after Andrew Watson was Nigel Quashie in 2004, 123 years later. He also became the first non-white player to score for the Scotland senior team (Scotland 4x1 Trinidad &amp; Tobago).

==Later life and tributes==
Watson retired to London in around 1910 and died of pneumonia at 88 Forest Road, Kew, in 1921. He is buried in Richmond Cemetery.

In 1926, the sportswriter &quot;Tityrus&quot; (the pseudonym of J. A. H. Catton, editor of the &quot;Athletic News&quot;) named Andrew Watson as left-back in his all-time Scotland team. A mural of Watson was painted on the side of a cafe in Shawlands, south Glasgow in 2020, and he also features prominently in the First Hampden Mural at Hampden Bowling Club.

<text>Askold and Dir (&quot;Haskuldr&quot; or &quot;Hǫskuldr&quot; and &quot;Dyr&quot; or &quot;Djur&quot; in Old Norse; died in 882), mentioned in both the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot;, were the earliest known rulers of Kiev.
== The name Askold ==

=== Askold ===
Also — &quot;Oskold&quot;, &quot;Oskol&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;Oskolod&quot;. (&quot;Осколд&quot;, &quot;Оскольд&quot;, &quot;Осколод&quot;)

There are several versions of the origin of the name Askold. The most likely version interprets it as the Norse name Haskuldr or Höskuldr. However, the spelling Askold may only be a change in the Scandinavian manner (similar to Vytautas – Vitold).&quot; According to Doctor of Historical Sciences, professor Igor Danilevsky, who is a specialist on the history of Kievan Rus, the Scandinavian origin of the name is certain and it has long been proved.

The suffix -ald- is found in Celtic names. There is also a theory of the Hungarian origin of the name, which has no sufficient grounds.

G. Magner defended the theory of the Slavic origin of the name, deriving it from the word &quot;skoldyryt&quot; – to accumulate. Other supporters of the theory of Slavic origin saw in the word the roots oskal (grin), sokol (falcon), kol (spike) and kolo (circle). It is also possible that the part -old is a contraction of -volod/-vlad (lord, ruler). This hypothesis does not contradict the data of modern historical grammar.

Boris Rybakov expressed a conjecture that the appearance of the names of Askold and Dir in the annals is a consequence of an error of one of the early chroniclers. Allegedly, in fact, in the original text it was about one Kievan prince Askoldyr or more precisely Oskoldyr. In this case, Dir did not exist at all. But such a reading of the annalistic text is the result of an assumption that has no textual basis according to Igor Danilevsky&#x27;s assertion. It did, however, allow Rybakov to &quot;establish&quot; the Slavic etymology of the name Askold from the names of the rivers Oskil and Vorskla (in chronicle Voroskol). The name of the Oskil (Oskol) river, in turn, was associated by B. A. Rybakov with the Black Sea tribe of the &quot;royal&quot; Scythians, the Scolots, mentioned by Herodotus. Those were allegedly Slavs (contrary to Herodotus himself, who wrote that the Skolots called themselves Scythians), who later began to call themselves Rus&#x27;.

&quot;Askolt&quot; may be a borrowed word from Iranian-speaking nomads and mean &quot;Border ruler.&quot;

=== Anti-Normanism ===
A direction in Russian pre-Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet historiography, whose supporters deny the role of the Scandinavians in the creation of the Rus&#x27; state or deny at all any participation of the Scandinavians (Normans) in the socio-political life of Rus&#x27;; reject and seek to refute the &quot;Norman theory&quot; of the creation of the Kievan Rus&#x27;. Anti-Normanist historians denied the Scandinavian (Old Norse) origin of the name Askold. Anti-Normanism includes a wide range of concepts and hypotheses, the common features of which are the denial of the essentiality of the influence of the Scandinavians on the political and economic processes of the formation of ancient Rus&#x27; and the advancement of alternative Norman hypotheses.

A number of late medieval sources, among them the &quot;Kievan Synopsis&quot; (1674), report that Oskold was the last representative of the local dynasty of Prince Kyi. Referring to these annalistic evidences, Aleksey Shakhmatov considered the fact of the Slavic origin of Prince Oskold beyond doubt. Among the researchers of the 20th century this idea was shared by professor Mikhail Tikhomirov, and professor Rybakov, in confirmation of the Slavic origin of the prince, the name Oskold derived from the name of the river Oskil, and therefore in his opinion it would be correct to use not &quot;Askold&quot;, but exactly &quot;Oskold&quot;, as it is found in the Old Rus&#x27; chronicles (or &quot;Oskolod&quot; – as indicated in the Nikiforov Chronicle of the 15th century, Suprasl Chronicle of the 16th century or medieval Polish chronicle of Maciej Stryjkowski). But these conclusions are biased as they are part of the Anti-Normanism sentiment.

Historian F. Donald Logan wrote:

According to the historian and archaeologist L. S. Klein, the &quot;Norman theory&quot; or &quot;Normanism&quot; never existed as a scientific concept, while Anti-Normanism exists, but is primarily an ideological platform based on an inferiority complex. Anti-Normanism is distinctive for Russia.

== Origins of Askold and Dir ==
Some historians, based on late and unreliable sources, try to declare Askold and Dir to be direct heirs of the legendary Kyi, a representative of the dynasty of &quot;Kievichi&quot;. The existence of this &quot;princely dynasty&quot; is based on the information of the Polish historian of the 15th century Jan Dlugosz, who wrote that the chronicle&#x27;s Kievan princes Askold and Dir, killed by Igor (according to the Primary Chronicle killed by Oleg), were descendants of Kyi. This message of Dlugosz was used in the works of Dmitry Ilovaysky (who treated the facts quite arbitrarily) and Mykhailo Hrushevsky (who strove to prove the existence of a distinct Ukrainian ethnos already in the 4th century); Aleksey Shakhmatov also referred to them in his historical reconstructions. However, this point of view is rarely supported by specialists.

The mention by Jan Dlugosz of the family ties of Askold and Dir with the legendary Kyi raises serious doubts. According to Vladimir Petrukhin: &quot;Jan Dlugosz was not so naive as some modern authors who uncritically accepted his conclusions. The fact is that the Polish chronicler sought to substantiate the claims of the Polish state on Kiev and therefore associated the Kiev Polans with Polish Polans, considered Kyi a &quot;Polish pagan prince&quot;, etc.&quot; Therefore, we have no grounds to believe that Askold and Dir belonged to the &quot;dynasty of Kievichi&quot; (or even were Slavs).

== &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; ==
Until the 19th century, the Primary Chronicle (the Nachal&#x27;naya Letopis&#x27;) was habitually attributed to the monk Nestor. Modern investigators have not only placed his authorship in doubt, but have also sought to establish by internal evidence that the Primary Chronicle, instead of being a homogenous work, is a compilation from several chronicle texts of greater antiquity. Nestor the Chronicler is the undisputed author of the biographical work &quot;The Narrative of the Life, Death and Miracles of the Holy and Blessed Martyrs Boris and Gleb&quot; and a comparative study of two accounts presents no stylistic evidence that Nestor was in any way concerned with the composition or compilation of the Primary Chronicle, while the contradictions between the two narratives point rather in the opposite direction. A more likely candidate as author is Sylvester of Kiev, hegumen (abbot) of the St. Michael&#x27;s Monastery in Vydubychi (a village near Kyiv), who may have compiled several sources in the year 1116. In any case, the Primary Chronicle was written approximately 250 years after the events involving Askold and Dir.

The beginning of the Synod Scroll or &quot;Older Edition&quot; of the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; is missing. The surviving text starts in the middle of a sentence in the year 1016. The lost contents of the Synod Scroll before the year 1016 are unknown, and can only be speculated about.

The &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; relates that Askold and Dir were sanctioned by Rurik to go to Constantinople (Norse &quot;Miklagård&quot;, Slavic &quot;Tsargrad&quot;). When travelling on the Dnieper, they settled in Kiev seizing power over the Polans who had been paying tribute to the Khazars. 
=== The murder of Askold and Dir ===

The chronicle also states that they were killed by Varangian Novgorod prince Oleg the Wise in 882. Dating is tentative, as the annalistic legend was written in one and a half or two centuries after the event. Behind the annalistic story there is a real event, violent transition of authority in Kiev to new dynasty Rurikovich. The murder described in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (Tale of Bygone Years) and the Novgorod First Chronicle. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Oleg set forth, taking with him many warriors from among the Varangians, the Chuds, the Slavs, the Meryans, the Ves&#x27;, the Krivichians. He thus arrived with his Krivichians before Smolensk, captured the city, and set up a garrison there. Thence he went on and captured Lyubech, where he also set up a garrison. He then came to the hills of Kiev, and saw how Askold and Dir reigned there. Oleg came to the foot of the Hungarian hill using trickery, he hid his warriors in the boats, left some others behind, and went forward himself bearing the child Igor’. Oleg sent messengers to Askold and Dir, representing himself as a guest (merchant) on his way to Greece on an errand for Oleg and for Igor&#x27;, the prince&#x27;s son, and requesting that they should come forth to greet them as members of their kinship. Askold and Dir straightway came forth. Then all the soldiery jumped out of the boats, and Oleg said to Askold and Dir, &quot;You are not princes nor even of princely stock, but I am of princely birth.&quot; Igor&#x27; was then brought forward, and Oleg announced him as a son of Rurik. They killed Askold and Dir, and after carrying them to the hill, they buried them there, on the hill known as Hungarian. After that, without resistance from the people of Kiev, Oleg settled to rule in Kiev, proclaiming it the &quot;mother of Rus&#x27; cities&quot; (the chronicler called Kiev &quot;mother&quot; rather than &quot;father&quot; through the prince&#x27;s words, because &quot;mother of cities&quot; is a literal translation of the Greek word &quot;metropolis,&quot; i.e., &quot;capital&quot;).

Vasily Tatishchev, Boris Rybakov and some other Russian and Ukrainian historians interpreted the 882 coup d&#x27;état in Kiev as the reaction of the pagan Varangians to Askold&#x27;s baptism. Tatishchev went so far as to style Askold &quot;the first Rus&#x27; martyr&quot;. Igor was still &quot;very young&quot;, and Oleg was &quot;carrying&quot; him to Kiev.

In the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;, it was not Oleg, but Igor who initiated the actions: telling Askold that he, unlike Igor himself, was not a prince or of a princely clan, Igor and his soldiers killed Askold and Dir, and then Igor rather than Oleg became prince in Kiev. There is also no mention of Kiev being proclaimed as the &quot;mother of Rus&#x27; cities&quot;. Igor went on to impose tributes on various tribes, and brought himself a wife named Olga from Pleskov (Pskov), with whom he had a son called Sviatoslav. Ostrowski (2018) noted that this is rather different from the narrative in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, where Oleg is in charge while Igor is passive and not mentioned again until 23 later: &quot;As Igor’ grew up, he followed after Oleg, and obeyed his instructions&quot;, and Olga &quot;was brought to him from Pskov&quot; to be his bride. In the subsequent Rusʹ–Byzantine War (907) (absent in Byzantine sources), the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; again narrates that it was Igor leading the attack ( &quot;Prince Igor went against the Greeks with thousands of Rus&#x27; warriors.&quot;), yet the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; once more claims: &quot;Oleg went against the Greeks, leaving Igor’ in Kiev.&quot;


==Al-Masudi==
The only foreign source to mention one of the co-rulers is the Arab historian Al-Masudi. According to him, &quot;king al-Dir [Dayr] was the first among the kings of the &quot;Slavs&quot;.&quot; Although some scholars have tried to prove that &quot;al-Dir&quot; refers to a Slavic ruler and Dir&#x27;s contemporary, this speculation is questionable and it is at least equally probable that &quot;al-Dir&quot; and Dir were the same person. Following his works, historians believe that Dir ruled after Askold, mainly in the 870—880s. In that case, on entering Kyiv, Oleg&#x27;s soldiers killed just Dir while Askold had died earlier.

==Facts and records==
The Rus&#x27; attack on Constantinople in June 860 took the Greeks by surprise, &quot;like a thunderbolt from heaven,&quot; as it was put by Patriarch Photios in his famous oration written for the occasion. Although the Slavonic chronicles tend to associate this expedition with the names of Askold and Dir (and to date it to 866), the connection remains tenuous. Despite Photius&#x27; own assertion that he sent a bishop to the land of Rus&#x27; which became Christianized and friendly to Byzantium, most historians discard the idea of Askold&#x27;s subsequent conversion as apocryphal.
We may suppose that the names of Rurik and his kin, of Askold and Dir, and of Oleg and Igor&#x27; survived in popular legend at Kiev in somewhat the same fashion as the heroes of the later bÿlinÿ. The problem for the author of the Primary Chronicle was to extract from these fragmentary survivals the semblance of an historical account. While there may be some conceivable doubt whether Rurik and his relatives, and possibly Askold and Dir, were actual personages, Oleg and Igor are soundly attested, presumably with dates, by the treaties with the Greeks in which they are mentioned by name. So the existence of Askold and Dir should be taken with a pinch of salt, as these two rulers were semi-legendary personalities, and the existence of Rurik should be taken with an even bigger pinch of salt, as he was a legendary personality in history.

A Kievan legend identifies Askold&#x27;s burial mound with Uhorska Hora (Hungarian hill), where Olga of Kiev later built two churches, devoted to Saint Nicholas and to Saint Irene. Today this place on the steep bank of the Dnieper is marked by a monument called Askold&#x27;s Grave.

<text>Darien II was the last ship to bring Aliya Bet refugees to Haifa during World War II. A former lighthouse tender, she sailed from the Black Sea to Palestine in early 1941.

==Ship history==

===Early career===
The ship was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Glasgow in 1892 for the Northern Lighthouse Board and served as a tender, named Pole Star, based at Stromness. She was renamed Orphir in 1931, and then sold to William Marshall of Glasgow for conversion to a salvage ship under the same name. In 1933 she was again sold to James M. Stewart of Glasgow. It was used in 1935 to discover the wreck of RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. In 1939 it was sold to P. Svolakis &amp; Co., of Piraeus, Greece, renamed Sophia S, and registered at Colón, Panama.

===Aliya Bet===
In May 1940 the ship was purchased in Piraeus by Moshe Agami and Shmarya Zameret for $40,000. Zameret, who was a U.S. citizen, was the registered owner, and renamed the ship Darien II, still registered under the Panamanian flag. Both men were members of Mossad LeAliyah Bet, a branch of Haganah that organised illegal Jewish emigration from Europe to the British Mandate of Palestine. They planned to take the &quot;Darien II&quot; to a port in Yugoslavia to rescue 822 Jews from Poland, Germany and Austria, who had attempted to leave Europe in the ship &quot;Uranus&quot; via the Danube, but had been stranded at Kladovo on the Romanian/Yugoslav border. This plan was abandoned after the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 made entering the Adriatic too dangerous.

The ship then became involved in a struggle between two branches of Haganah, one dedicated to bringing Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions, and the other actively co-operating with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) to provide Jewish agents to carry out acts of sabotage and intelligence gathering in enemy territory. Various plans were put forward for the ship. Eliyahu Golomb suggested using her to simultaneously infiltrate agents and rescue Jewish refugees in Romania. Another suggestion was to sink the ship at the mouth of the Danube, blocking the entrance. A third plan involved occupying the port of Constanța, Romania, and appears to have received some support from the Royal Navy. Eventually the ship was sold to SOE for £15,000 to operate in the Balkans in cooperation with Haganah, though Zameret remained the registered owner and the ship remained under the control of Mossad LeAliyah Bet.

In August 1940 the &quot;Darien II&quot; sailed to Alexandria, then to Istanbul, and finally arrived at Constanța in November. There refugees from Romania and Poland boarded, and the ship sailed to Sulina where more refugees were expected. She waited until the end of December, but when they did not arrive, the ship finally left. On the return voyage to Constanța the &quot;Darien II&quot; hit a reef and had to be towed to a dry-dock for repairs. On 17 February 1941 &quot;Darien II&quot; left Constanța with 460 refugees on board, arriving at Varna, Bulgaria, the next day. When the Bulgarian authorities arrested the ship&#x27;s captain, Olaf Bergenson, a former Norwegian naval officer, was appointed to command. On 28 February the ship sailed from Varna with 750 refugees aboard, arriving in Istanbul on 2 March. More refugees were embarked there bringing the total up to 792, which included survivors from the &quot;Salvador&quot;, another Aliyah Bet ship that sank in the Sea of Marmara on 14 December 1940 with the loss of 204, including 66 children.

On 15 March 1941, the ship sailed from Istanbul. It was not intercepted by the British, and could have landed the refugees on the coast. However the ship sailed directly into Haifa on 19 March, and the refugees were detained in the Atlit detainee camp, and were not all released until 22 May 1942.

Among the refugees aboard &quot;Darien II&quot; were Abba Berdichev, who joined SOE and was parachuted back into Europe only to be caught and executed by the Germans, and Shulamit, later wife of prime minister Yitzhak Shamir.

===Later career and disposal===
The &quot;Darien II&quot; was requisitioned by the British authorities, and under their control sailed to Tobruk in late 1941 following the lifting of the siege. She was then berthed at Alexandria, resuming convoy duties in early 1943 between ports in North Africa, and later Sicily, then shifting operations to ports in mainland Italy in 1944–1945.

She operated under the control of the Ministry of War Transport, and was managed by the Wilson Line in 1945, and was purchased from her owners by the Ministry of Transport in 1948 to operate in the Eastern Mediterranean. She was eventually laid up at Port Said in 1950, sold to Italian ship-breakers, and arrived at Spezia for breaking up in 1951.

==In media==
&quot;The Darien Dilemma&quot;, a film that mixed a fictionalized retelling of the final Aliya Bet sailing with interviews of actual passengers, premièred at the Tel Aviv International Documentary Film Festival in April 2006.

<text>The &quot;Unfederated Malay States&quot; (; Jawi: ) was the collective name given to five British protected states in the Malay Peninsula during the first half of the 20th century. These states were Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu. In contrast with the four adjoining Federated Malay States of Selangor, Perak, Pahang, and Negeri Sembilan, the five Unfederated Malay States lacked common institutions, and did not form a single state in international law; they were in fact standalone British protectorates.

In 1946, the British colony of the Straits Settlements was dissolved. Penang and Malacca, which had formed a part of the Straits Settlements, were then grouped with the Unfederated Malay States and the Federated Malay States to form the Malayan Union. In 1948, the Malayan Union was reconstituted as a federation of eleven states known as the Federation of Malaya. Nine of the states of the new Federation of Malaya continued as British protected states, while two of them, Penang and Malacca, remained as British colonies. The Federation of Malaya gained full independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1957.

==History==
Johor accepted a treaty of protection with the United Kingdom in 1885, and eventually succumbed to British pressure to accept a resident &quot;Advisor&quot; in 1914. Unlike the other Malay states under British protection, however, Johor remained outside of the Federated Malay States (formed in 1895).

Under the Bangkok Treaty of 1909, Siam transferred its rights over Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis to the United Kingdom. These states then became British protected states. With the assistance of Japan, they temporarily returned to Thai jurisdiction for the latter part of World War II.

==Administration and language==
The chief officer of the British colonial administration was the &quot;Advisor&quot;. In contrast with the Federated Malay States, the Unfederated Malay States enjoyed greater autonomy. The &quot;de facto&quot; official language of the Unfederated Malay States was Malay (written with the Jawi script).

<doc id="995366" wikidata="Q908746" url="?curid=995366" title="Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)">
<text>Maiden Voyage is the fifth album led by jazz musician Herbie Hancock, and was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder on March 17, 1965, for Blue Note Records. It was issued as BLP 4195 and BST 84195. Featuring Hancock with tenor saxophonist George Coleman, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams, it is a concept album aimed at creating an oceanic atmosphere. As such, many of the track titles refer to marine biology or the sea, and the musicians develop the concept through their use of space. The album was presented with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999.

==Overview==
Coleman, Carter, Williams and Hancock himself were all recently a part of the Miles Davis quintet.

According to Bob Blumenthal&#x27;s 1999 liner notes: &quot;Blue Note logs indicate that an attempt had been made to record &#x27;Maiden Voyage&#x27;, &#x27;Little One&#x27;, and &#x27;Dolphin Dance&#x27; six days earlier, with Hubbard on cornet and Stu Martin in place of Williams. Those performances were rejected at the time and have been lost in the ensuing years.&quot; A different version of &quot;Little One&quot; was recorded by Miles Davis and his quintet (by then including Wayne Shorter instead of Coleman) for the album &quot;E.S.P.,&quot; also released in 1965.

Hancock cites Count Basie&#x27;s &quot;Shiny Stockings&quot; as the main source of inspiration for &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; designated the album as part of its Core Collection with a four star rating, calling it &quot;a colossal achievement from a man still just 24 years old&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes the album as &quot;arguably his finest record of the &#x27;60s, reaching a perfect balance between accessible, lyrical jazz and chance-taking hard bop&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, &quot;The Eye of the Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; have become jazz standards and are featured in Hal Leonard&#x27;s New Real Book vol. 2. While being interviewed for KCET in 2011, Hancock said he considered &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; to be his favorite of all of the compositions he had written. During an interview on KTLA in 2020, the composer told Frank Buckley that he originally wrote the tune for a television commercial. Hancock was the pianist on another version of &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; for Bobby Hutcherson&#x27;s album &quot;Happenings&quot; which was recorded in February 1966. Hancock rerecorded &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; and &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; on his 1974 album &quot;Dedication&quot; and updated the title track on his 1988 album &quot;Perfect Machine&quot;. &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; was rerecorded in 1981 for the &quot;Herbie Hancock Trio&quot; album. Hancock has released live concert versions of &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; on &quot;CoreaHancock&quot; (1979) and &quot;An Evening With Herbie Hancock &amp; Chick Corea: In Concert&quot; (1980) (both with Chick Corea). Hancock recorded &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Hurricane&quot; with the VSOP Quintet on &quot;&quot; (1977).

<text>(TYO: 8235, delisted) is a major Japanese department store chain operated by Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores, a subsidiary of J. Front Retailing. When the chain was an independent company, , it had its headquarters in Naka-ku, Nagoya.

== History ==
Established in 1611 in Nagoya by , it is one of the oldest department stores in the world. It was initially a modest wholesale manufactory of silk kimono and Japanese lacquerware. In 1736 the company expanded its business to the retail sale of cotton and linen kimono. A second store was opened in Kyoto in 1745. The old capital was at that time the only region producing high-quality kimono.

The store in Ueno at Shitaya Hirokoji was depicted in an ukiyo-e print from &quot;One Hundred Famous Views of Edo&quot; by Hiroshige II in 1856.

With the industrialisation during the Meiji era, Matsuzakaya store was changed in 1910 to a western-style department store. In 1924, its Ginza branch became the first department store in Japan where customers could keep their shoes on everywhere inside the store (before that, people had to leave their shoes at the cloakroom). In 1931 a centre for textile art was opened in the Kyoto branch. Between 1931-1939, a remarkable collection of kimono came together with the work of dye craftsmen, antique dealers, and private collectors.

Formerly there was a branch at Patterson Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong; this was the second Hong Kong branch, the first being when the Japanese Military Government of Hong Kong renamed and transferred Lane Crawford to Matsuzakaya. The branch in Paris had to close when the Japanese economy started cooling in the late 1980s. The store in Yokohama had to close in 2008.

There are branches in Ginza and Ueno in Tokyo, Shizuoka City, Toyota, Aichi, and Takatsuki, Osaka. The store at Ginza was closed in 2013 for a large makeover. It was reopened in 2017 as Ginza Six.

The south wing of the main store in Nagoya has in its lobby a large pipe organ. It was made in Canada and has 3231 pipes, of which the longest is 11 meters. On the top floor of the south wing is the Matsuzakaya Art Museum. The latest exhibitions featured ancient Egyptian treasures from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, works by Rubens from the collection of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci from the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków, and exhibit about empress Maria Theresa and Schönbrunn Palace.

The Guimet Museum in Paris has a special exhibition on the kimono collection of Matsuzakaya from February–May 2017.

Along with Maruei, Meitetsu, and formerly Oriental Nakamura (now Mitsukoshi), Matsuzakaya is one of the four major department stores of Nagoya.

== Public transport ==
The main store in Nagoya is served by Yabachō Station and has a direct underground passage and entry to the subway.

<text>Cao Chong (196–208), courtesy name Cangshu, was a son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China. A child prodigy, Cao Chong is best known for his ingenious method of weighing an elephant using the principle of buoyancy. He was considered by his father as a possible successor but died prematurely at the age of 12.

==Family background==
Cao Chong was the eldest son of Cao Cao and his concubine Lady Huan (環夫人). He had two younger brothers: Cao Ju and Cao Yu. He was a child prodigy and, according to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;possessed the intelligence of an adult&quot; when he was around the age of five.

==Principle of buoyancy==
On one occasion, the southern warlord Sun Quan sent an elephant as a gift to Cao Cao. Cao Cao wanted to know the animal&#x27;s weight so he asked his subordinates but no one could think of a method to measure the elephant&#x27;s weight. Cao Chong said, &quot;Place the elephant on a boat and mark the water level. Then replace the elephant with other objects until the boat is submerged to the same level. The weight of the elephant can be found by summing up the weights of all the objects.&quot; Cao Cao was delighted and he had Cao Chong&#x27;s idea implemented.

According to Joseph Needham, although no official treatise in the likes of Archimedes&#x27; principle was ever written regarding buoyancy in ancient China, there were observational precedents of it in the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;, compiled and edited in the early Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE). Needham states:

==Rodents incident==
In another incident, Cao Cao&#x27;s saddle was chewed by rodents when it was kept in a store. The storekeepers feared for their lives because the laws were very harsh during those times of war, so they planned to tie themselves up and admit their mistake to Cao Cao in the hope of receiving a lenient punishment. Cao Chong told them, &quot;Wait for three days before reporting the incident.&quot; He used a knife to cut holes in his clothes, making it seem as though they had been damaged by rats, and then pretended to look upset. When his father asked him, he replied, &quot;There is a saying that a person whose clothes have been chewed by rats will encounter ill luck. Now, as this has happened to me, I fear something might happen.&quot; Cao Cao said, &quot;This is just a superstition. There&#x27;s nothing to worry about.&quot; When the storekeepers reported the saddle incident to Cao Cao three days later, Cao Cao laughed and said, &quot;My son&#x27;s clothes were with him, yet they were still chewed by rats, so it is not surprising that my saddle in the store was also damaged.&quot; He did not pursue the matter.

==Favoured by his father==
Cao Chong was known to be kind and understanding. He helped to review cases of indicted criminals for any injustice and successfully cleared tens of cases. When some hardworking officials landed themselves in trouble for making minor lapses, Cao Chong spoke up for them and managed to persuade his father to pardon them.

Cao Chong&#x27;s intelligence and compassionate attitude, coupled with his beautiful looks, made him very outstanding among his brothers and earned him the favor of his father. Cao Cao often praised Cao Chong in front of his subordinates and had the intention of making Cao Chong his heir apparent.

==Death and succession==
Cao Chong became seriously ill when he was 12 and died. Cao Cao was extremely grieved. When Cao Pi (another of Cao Cao&#x27;s sons) came to console his father, Cao Cao remarked, &quot;Cao Chong&#x27;s death is my misfortune, but it is to the advantage of you and your brothers.&quot;

Cao Cao shed tears whenever Cao Chong was mentioned. He had Cao Chong buried together with a deceased woman from a certain Zhen (甄) family and posthumously granted his son the appointment Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉). Cao Cong (曹琮), the Marquis of Wan (宛侯) and a son of Cao Chong&#x27;s younger brother Cao Ju, was designated Cao Chong&#x27;s heir. In 217, Cao Cong was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Deng (鄧侯).

In 221, after Cao Pi established the state of Cao Wei, he granted Cao Chong the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Ai of Deng&quot; (鄧哀侯) but elevated him to the status of a duke later, so Cao Chong became known as &quot;Duke Ai of Deng&quot; (鄧哀公). In 231, during the reign of Cao Pi&#x27;s son Cao Rui, Cao Chong was posthumously honoured as &quot;Prince Ai of Deng&quot; (鄧哀王). Cao Pi once said, &quot;My elder brother (Cao Ang) was a &quot;xiaolian&quot; and had the right to the succession. If Cangshu was around, I&#x27;d not have been able to obtain the empire.&quot;

<text>Chughtai or Chagatai (Urdu, ; ,) is a family name that originated in the Chagatai Khanate as taken up by the descendants and successors of Chagatai Khan who was the second son of Mongol Emperor Genghis Khan. Accordingly, some of the other descendants of the successors of Chagatai Khan in South and Central Asia use variants such as Mirza, Baig and Khan.

== Etymology of Chughtai ==
The surname “Chughtai” originates from the Mongolian word “Chaghadai”, a derivative of “Chagan” meaning “white”. The suffix “-dai” is added to form “Chaghadai”. Over time, “Chaghadai” evolved into “Chughtai”, meaning, “he who is white”.
== People with the surname ==

<text>1200 Techniques are an Australian hip hop group formed in 1997 in Melbourne, Australia, consisting of DJ Peril (Jason Foretti) as producer, percussionist, DJ; N&#x27;fa Forster-Jones as lead vocalist (under the name Nfamas) and Kemstar (DJ Peril&#x27;s brother, Simon Foretti) as lead guitarist. Whilst primarily being in the genre of hip hip, they drew influences from other genres including rock, funk, soul, electro, drum and bass, electro jazz and breakbeat. They released their debut studio album, &quot;Choose One&quot;, in March 2002.

AllMusic&#x27;s Jody Macgregor wrote, &quot;Although Australia had an underground hip-hop scene starting in the late &#x27;80s, it wasn&#x27;t until 2001 that it began to be recognized by the mainstream of Australian music. 1200 Techniques were an important part of that moment, with charting singles, appearances on TV shows like John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree, and a sound that contained an eclectic blend of rock, dance, and funk influences to win over those Australians unconvinced their country had a place as a producer of quality hip-hop music.&quot; The group disbanded in 2005 and reformed in 2014.

==History==

Brothers DJ Peril (Jason Foretti) and Kemstar (Simon Foretti) were involved in Australian hip hop, since the early 1980s as pre-teens. DJ Peril started with the Island Boys, one of Melbourne&#x27;s first ever hip hop crews and he was the DJ in a number of different bands: Big Pacific, Rollercoaster, Dub and Reggae, and Blow Sound Unit.

Peril formed 1200 Techniques in 1997, as producer, percussionist and DJ, with the English-born brothers Nfamas (N&#x27;fa) on lead vocals and Kabba Foster-Jones on vocals. The Foster-Jones brothers had moved from London to Perth in 1983, they were both in a hip-hop crew, Deadly Fresh, during the mid-1990s before relocating to Melbourne. When DJ Peril saw the duo working with another band, he approached them, &quot;I thought they were wasting their talent.&quot; The group&#x27;s name references, &quot;the Technics 1200 turntable the name also represents the multi-direction attitude of the group&#x27;s music.&quot; Kemstar joined soon after, Kabba then returned to London in 1999. Kabba&#x27;s vocals can still, however, be heard on some of the group&#x27;s early tracks, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;. 1200 Techniques continued with the three remaining core members, recruiting a drummer for live shows.

In 2001, 1200 Techniques were signed to an independent label called Rubber Records and they released their debut Extended Play titled &quot;Infinite Style&quot;. The lead single from the EP &quot;Hard as Hell&quot; was released and had a low budget video clip which saw the song receive national recognition on Triple J.

In April 2002, the band released the single &quot;Karma&quot;, the lead single from their debut studio album &quot;Choose One&quot;. &quot;Karma&quot; became a crossover success. &quot;Choose One&quot; was released in June and peaked at number 20 on the ARIA Charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, the group were nominated for five awards, with &quot;Karma&quot; winning ARIA Award for Best Independent Release and ARIA Award for Best Video. Also in 2002, the band won Best Debut Artist&quot; and Best Hip Hop Act at the Dance Music Awards. The group supported Linkin Park on their 2002 Australian tour that year and headlined their own tour with support by American rapper Princess Superstar.

Their second album &quot;Consistency Theory&quot; was released in January 2004, and peaked at No. 38 on the ARIA album chart. Three singles were released from the album and all appeared on the ARIA singles chart. Following the album&#x27;s release, the group appeared at the Big Day Out festival in early 2004. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, the lead single &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; was nominated for two awards. The group went on hiatus in 2005 to allow the individual members to pursue solo work. In October 2014, the group reformed and announced the release of a new extended play. After a successful fundraising campaign on PledgeMusic, the band released &quot;Time Has Come&quot; in January 2015.

<text>Reginald Horace Bannister (born September 29, 1945) is an American musician, actor, producer, writer, and activist. He is known for his role as Reggie in the &quot;Phantasm&quot; film series.

==Career==
Bannister is known for playing the gun-toting, ex-ice cream man Reggie in the &quot;Phantasm&quot; film series. Bannister starred in the films, which were directed by Don Coscarelli, alongside A. Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, and Angus Scrimm.

Bannister has appeared in several films and worked with such notables as Ossie Davis, Bruce Campbell, Ella Joyce, Daniel Roebuck, Andy Griffith, Joe Estevez and Andrew Divoff, and many others. Bannister has played many roles from Reggie in the &quot;Phantasm&quot; series to Herb Tooklander in the latest Stephen King adaption of &quot;One for the Road&quot;.

Along with co-producer Tim Sullivan and writer/director Paul Ward, he has also co-produced and starred in the short sequel to &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, entitled, &quot;One for the Road&quot;. This film stars Bannister as well as Adam Robitel as Booth and Audrey Walters as Janey Lumley.

In 2012, Bannister and his wife, Gigi, have collaborated with co-writer Shelby McIntyre and co-writer/director Vito Trabucco on the comedy horror film &quot;Bloody Bloody Bible Camp&quot;. After having worked with Sullivan on &quot;One for the Road&quot;, Bannister had even asked Sullivan to co-produce and star in the film as the main villain, Sister Mary Chopper, which Sullivan accepted.

Bannister composed the song &quot;Have You Seen It&quot; (used in &quot;Phantasm IV: Oblivion&quot;) and arranged &quot;Sittin&#x27; Here at Midnight&quot; with Bill Thornbury (used in &quot;Phantasm&quot;).

==Personal life==
Reggie Bannister is a United States Military Veteran who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Reggie states in an article &quot;Getting back to the Vietnam thing. I was not for that war, I was against it, but there was this thing called the draft. I had friends who were going to Canada and I wasn&#x27;t going to do that, I stand up to what&#x27;s in front of me, and so just like anything else I just thought, &#x27;Soldier? Really? You&#x27;re gonna be a soldier? Okay, well then you&#x27;re going to be the baddest-ass soldier that ever put on a uniform.&#x27; So I just took that attitude, Landon, and just went for it. I was a head radio operator for an automatic weapons specialty group.&quot; He was often around .40 and .50 caliber weapons, ultimately resulting in some hearing loss. Because of this, he is a service connected disabled veteran, on top of which he was exposed to Agent Orange. Reggie took his GI Bill from the military and used it to study acting.

Bannister currently resides in Crestline, California, where he lives with his wife. In 2016 he was diagnosed with dementia and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

On February 21, 2025, it was announced that his health was deteriorating and that he was going to begin receiving hospice care at his home in Crestline.

<text>Yehuda Arazi (; 27 November 1907 – 25 February 1959), code name &quot;Alon&quot;, was an Israeli who was active in the Haganah in Palestine during the British Mandate era.

==Biography==
Arazi was born in Łódź to a Jewish family in 1907. He immigrated with his parents to Tel Aviv in the Mandatory Palestine in 1924, studying in the Gymnasia Herzlia. While in Palestine, Arazi joined the Haganah and the Palestine Police Force. As a police officer, he was most notably involved as the investigating officer in the 1933 murder of Chaim Arlosoroff. In 1936, Arazi was sent back to Poland to help smuggle matériel to Palestine.

In 1931 he married Rivka Albin, a year later their daughter Ruth was born. She married in 1955 the Supreme Court judge Gabriel Bach. His son Dan was born in 1941.

In 1943 he stole 5,000 rifles from the British Police for the Haganah, and had to go into hiding. In 1945, after two years of living in hiding as a wanted man in Palestine, Arazi and his partner Yitzhak Levy travelled to Egypt by train dressed as Royal Engineers sergeants. From there, they travelled through North Africa and into Italy, where they joined the Jewish Brigade of the British Army using falsified names. He was head of the Italy branch of the Mossad LeAliyah Bet, the Haganah agency involved in facilitating illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine, and was involved in the &quot;La Spezia&quot; affair.

After the independence of Israel in 1948, Arazi became a private businessman and built the Ramat Aviv Hotel. He died of brain cancer in 1959. Shortly before his death, he befriended the artist Chaim Goldberg, also a Polish Jew, who was commissioned to execute several sculptures and a fully functional water fountain for the front of his hotel. The artist established his studio in a former munitions factory that he received from Arazi, that was located behind the hotel.

Arazi and the La Spezia affair gave the inspiration to Leon Uris for Ari Ben Canaan in &quot;Exodus&quot;.

Arazi was known as “King of Ruses”, changing disguises and identities according to needs.

<text>A geodetic datum or geodetic system (also: geodetic reference datum, geodetic reference system, or geodetic reference frame, or terrestrial reference frame) is a global datum reference or reference frame for unambiguously representing the position of locations on Earth by means of either geodetic coordinates (and related vertical coordinates) or geocentric coordinates. 
Datums are crucial to any technology or technique based on spatial location, including geodesy, navigation, surveying, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and cartography. 
A horizontal datum is used to measure a horizontal position, across the Earth&#x27;s surface, in latitude and longitude or another related coordinate system. A &quot;vertical datum&quot; is used to measure the elevation or depth relative to a standard origin, such as mean sea level (MSL). A three-dimensional datum enables the expression of both horizontal and vertical position components in a unified form. 
The concept can be generalized for other celestial bodies as in &quot;planetary datums&quot;.

Since the rise of the global positioning system (GPS), the ellipsoid and datum WGS 84 it uses has supplanted most others in many applications. The WGS84 is intended for global use, unlike most earlier datums.
Before GPS, there was no precise way to measure the position of a location that was far from reference points used in the realization of local datums, such as from the Prime Meridian at the Greenwich Observatory for longitude, from the Equator for latitude, or from the nearest coast for sea level. Astronomical and chronological methods have limited precision and accuracy, especially over long distances. Even GPS requires a predefined framework on which to base its measurements, so WGS84 essentially functions as a datum, even though it is different in some particulars from a traditional standard horizontal or vertical datum.

A standard datum specification (whether horizontal, vertical, or 3D) consists of several parts: a model for Earth&#x27;s shape and dimensions, such as a &quot;reference ellipsoid&quot; or a &quot;geoid&quot;; an &quot;origin&quot; at which the ellipsoid/geoid is tied to a known (often monumented) location on or inside Earth (not necessarily at 0 latitude 0 longitude); and multiple control points or reference points that have been precisely measured from the origin and physically monumented. Then the coordinates of other places are measured from the nearest control point through surveying. Because the ellipsoid or geoid differs between datums, along with their origins and orientation in space, the relationship between coordinates referred to one datum and coordinates referred to another datum is undefined and can only be approximated. Using local datums, the disparity on the ground between a point having the same horizontal coordinates in two different datums could reach kilometers if the point is far from the origin of one or both datums. This phenomenon is called &quot;datum shift&quot; or, more generally, &quot;datum transformation&quot;, as it may involve rotation and scaling, in addition to displacement.

Because Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, local datums can give a more accurate representation of some specific area of coverage than WGS84 can. OSGB36, for example, is a better approximation to the geoid covering the British Isles than the global WGS84 ellipsoid. However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS84 datum has become widely adopted.

== History ==


The spherical nature of Earth was known by the ancient Greeks, who also developed the concepts of latitude and longitude, and the first astronomical methods for measuring them. These methods, preserved and further developed by Muslim and Indian astronomers, were sufficient for the global explorations of the 15th and 16th Centuries. 

However, the scientific advances of the Age of Enlightenment brought a recognition of errors in these measurements, and a demand for greater precision. This led to technological innovations such as the 1735 Marine chronometer by John Harrison, but also to a reconsideration of the underlying assumptions about the shape of Earth itself. Isaac Newton postulated that the conservation of momentum should make Earth oblate (wider at the equator than the corresponding sphere), while the early surveys of Jacques Cassini (1720) led him to believe Earth was prolate (narrower at the equator). The subsequent French geodesic missions (1735-1739) to Lapland and Peru corroborated Newton, but also discovered variations in gravity that would eventually lead to the geoid model.

A contemporary development was the use of the trigonometric survey to accurately measure distance and location over great distances. Starting with the surveys of Jacques Cassini (1718) and the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), by the end of the 18th century, survey control networks covered France and the United Kingdom. More ambitious undertakings such as the Struve Geodetic Arc across Eastern Europe (1816-1855) and the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (1802-1871) took much longer, but resulted in more accurate estimations of the shape of the Earth ellipsoid. The first triangulation across the United States was not completed until 1899.

The U.S. survey resulted in the North American Datum (horizontal) of 1927 (NAD27) and the Vertical Datum of 1929 (NAVD29), the first standard datums available for public use. This was followed by the release of national and regional datums over the next several decades. Improving measurements, including the use of early satellites, enabled more accurate datums in the later 20th century, such as NAD 83 in North America, ETRS89 in Europe, and GDA94 in Australia. At this time global datums were also first developed for use in satellite navigation systems, especially the World Geodetic System (WGS84) used in the U.S. global positioning system (GPS), and the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame (ITRF) used in the European Galileo system.

==Dimensions==

=== Horizontal datum ===
A horizontal datum is a model used to precisely measure positions on Earth; it is thus a crucial component of any spatial reference system or map projection. A horizontal datum binds a specified reference ellipsoid, a mathematical model of the shape of the earth, to the physical earth. Thus, the geographic coordinate system on that ellipsoid can be used to measure the latitude and longitude of real-world locations. Regional horizontal datums, such as NAD 27 and NAD 83, usually create this binding with a series of physically monumented geodetic control points of known location. Global datums, such as WGS 84 and ITRF, are typically bound to the center of mass of the Earth (making them useful for tracking satellite orbits and thus for use in satellite navigation systems.

A specific point can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. For example, coordinates in NAD83 can differ from NAD27 by up to several hundred feet. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The WGS 84 datum, which is almost identical to the NAD 83 datum used in North America and the ETRS89 datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.

=== Vertical datum ===

A vertical datum is a reference surface for vertical positions, such as the elevations of Earth features including terrain, bathymetry, water level, and human-made structures.

An approximate definition of sea level is the datum WGS 84, an ellipsoid, whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 spherical harmonics. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; ED50 was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
Mars has no oceans and so no sea level, but at least two martian datums have been used to locate places there.

== Geodetic coordinates ==


In &quot;geodetic coordinates&quot;, Earth&#x27;s surface is approximated by an ellipsoid, and locations near the surface are described in terms of &quot;geodetic latitude&quot; (formula_1), &quot;longitude&quot; (formula_2), and &quot;ellipsoidal height&quot; (formula_3).

== Earth reference ellipsoid ==
=== Defining and derived parameters ===
The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis formula_4 and the flattening formula_5.

From formula_4 and formula_5 it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis formula_8, first eccentricity formula_9 and second eccentricity formula_10 of the ellipsoid

=== Parameters for some geodetic systems ===
The two main reference ellipsoids used worldwide are the GRS80
and the WGS84.

A more comprehensive list of geodetic systems can be found here.

==== Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ====

==== World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) ====

The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) to determine the location of a point near the surface of Earth.

== Datum transformation ==
The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as &quot;datum shift&quot;. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The North Pole, South Pole and Equator will be in different positions on different datums, so True North will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of Earth (reference ellipsoids). For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700 feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as surveying or site location for scuba diving.

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Because the survey networks upon which datums were traditionally based are irregular, and the error in early surveys is not evenly distributed, datum conversion cannot be performed using a simple parametric function. For example, converting from NAD 27 to NAD 83 is performed using NADCON (later improved as HARN), a raster grid covering North America, with the value of each cell being the average adjustment distance for that area in latitude and longitude. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of map projection.

== Discussion and examples ==
A geodetic reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in North America are NAD27, NAD83, and WGS 84.

The North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27) is &quot;the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) Meades Ranch (Kansas).&quot; ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. &quot;Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used.&quot; NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is &quot;The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80). &quot;This datum, designated as NAD83…is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin.&quot; NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS84 is the World Geodetic System of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and is defined by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS84 is used by the DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its GPS &quot;broadcast&quot; and &quot;precise&quot; orbits. WGS84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) frame ITRF 94. It was then formally called WGS84 (G873). WGS84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997. Another update brought it to WGS84 (G1674).

The WGS84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

=== Examples ===
Examples of map datums are:
* WGS 84, 72, 66 and 60 of the World Geodetic System
* NAD 83, the North American Datum which is very similar to WGS84

* CGCS2000, or CGS-2000, the geodetic reference used by BeiDou Navigation Satellite System; based on ITRF97
* International Terrestrial Reference Frames (ITRF88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2014), different realizations of the ITRS.
* Hong Kong Principal Datum, a vertical datum used in Hong Kong.
* SAD69 - South American Datum 1969

==Plate movement==
The Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates move relative to one another in different directions at speeds on the order of per year. Therefore, locations on different plates are in motion relative to one another. For example, the longitudinal difference between a point on the equator in Uganda, on the African Plate, and a point on the equator in Ecuador, on the South American Plate, increases by about 0.0014 arcseconds per year. These tectonic movements likewise affect latitude.

If a global reference frame (such as WGS 84) is used, the coordinates of a place on the surface generally will change from year to year. Most mapping, such as within a single country, does not span plates. To minimize coordinate changes for that case, a different reference frame can be used, one whose coordinates are fixed to that particular plate. Examples of these reference frames are &quot;NAD 83&quot; for North America and &quot;ETRS89&quot; for Europe.

<text>Bass Brewery () was founded in 1777 by William Bass in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. The main brand was Bass Pale Ale, once the highest-selling beer in the UK. By 1877, Bass had become the largest brewery in the world, with an annual output of one million barrels. Its pale ale was exported throughout the British Empire, and the company&#x27;s red triangle became the UK&#x27;s first registered trade mark.

Bass took control of a number of other large breweries in the early 20th century. In the 1960s it merged with Charrington United Breweries to become the largest UK brewing company, Bass Charrington. The brewing operations of the company were bought by Interbrew (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) in 2000, while the retail side (hotels and pubs) was renamed Six Continents plc. Because at the time Interbrew controlled a large portion of the UK beer market, the Competition Commission instructed Interbrew to sell the Bass brewery along with certain brands to Coors (now Molson Coors), while retaining the rights to the Bass brand. In 2010, it was widely reported that AB-InBev was attempting to sell the rights to the Bass brand in the UK for around £10 million to £15 million.

In the UK, draught Bass (4.4% ABV) has been brewed under contract in Burton by Marston&#x27;s (formerly a relatively minor competitor) for AB-InBev since 2005, while bottled products are brewed at AB-InBev&#x27;s own brewery in Samlesbury, Lancashire, for export. Bass is also brewed locally in the United States and Belgium. Bass Ale is a top ten premium canned ale in the UK, with 16,080 hectolitres sold in 2010.

==History==

===18th century===
Before establishing a brewery, William Bass transported ale for brewer Benjamin Printon. Bass sold this carrier business to the Pickford family, using the funds to establish Bass &amp; Co Brewery in 1777 as one of the first breweries in Burton-upon-Trent.
===19th century===
Early in the company&#x27;s history, Bass was exporting bottled beer around the world, serving the Baltic region through the port of Hull. Growing demand led his son Michael Thomas Bass (1760–1827), to build a second brewery in Burton in 1799 in partnership with John Ratcliff. The water from local boreholes became popular with brewers, with 30 operating there by the mid-19th century. His son, Michael Thomas Bass (1799–1884), succeeded on his father&#x27;s death in 1827, renewed the Ratcliff partnership, brought in John Gretton, and created &#x27;Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton&#x27;.

The opening of a railway through Burton in 1839 redoubled Burton&#x27;s pre-eminence as a brewing town. In the mid-1870s, Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton accounted for one-third of Burton&#x27;s output. A strong export business allowed Bass to boast that their product was available &quot;in every country in the globe&quot;. By 1877, Bass was the largest brewery in the world, with an annual output of one million barrels. In the 1880s the brewery received unwanted publicity through the lifestyle of Frederick Gretton, son of John Gretton. Having worked for the company when a young man, he drifted away and developed a stable of racehorses. His &#x27;Sterling&#x27; and &#x27;Isonomy&#x27; were stars of the Turf. But Fred, as he was known, was also a heavy drinker and took a mistress, the teenage Fanny Lucy Radmall. In later life she would become a household name as Lucy, Lady Houston. When Fred died of drink in 1883 he left her £6,000 a year, much to the disgust of his family.

Following the death of the second Michael Thomas Bass in 1884, his son Michael Arthur Bass, later the 1st Baron Burton, took the reins. Both Michael Thomas Bass and his son Lord Burton were philanthropically inclined, making extensive charitable donations to the towns of Burton and Derby. The annual Bass excursions, laid on by the firm for its employees, were the largest operation of its type in the world by a private company. The brewer became a public limited company in 1888.

Bass&#x27; No. 1 Ale was the first beer to be marketed as barley wine, around 1870.

=== 20th century===
Early in the 20th century, a declining market closed many Burton breweries, 20 in 1900 falling to eight in 1928. Bass took over Walkers in 1923, and Worthington in 1927. Also in 1927, they acquired, for over £1,000,000, Thomas Salt, which was founded in 1774 as the Clay Brewery by Joseph Clay, who sold it to Salt, his maltster, just before the introduction by Napoleon of the Continental System that stopped all trade between Britain and Europe.

Bass was one of the original London Stock Exchange FT 30 companies when the listing was established in 1935. Over the next half-century, Bass maintained its UK dominance by acquiring such brewers as Mitchells &amp; Butlers (1961), Charringtons (1967), Bents-Gartsides (1967), John Joule &amp; Sons (1968), William Stones Ltd (1968), and Grimsby&#x27;s Hewitt Brothers Ltd (1969), being variously known as &quot;Bass, Mitchells and Butlers&quot; or &quot;Bass Charrington&quot;. Draught Bass ale and Worthingon &quot;E&quot; were merged to become the same product until Bass became preferred as the name of the cask beer and Worthington for keg, although some pubs resisted this distinction.

Bass had been reliant on railways to distribute its beer from Burton, and owned the country&#x27;s largest private rail network within the town linking its various premises. From the 1970s it followed the trend to abandon the use of rail freight, which had become notoriously unreliable. The switch to road haulage required local transport depots, and in many places small independent breweries were bought and repurposed as such. At that time, along with the other major brewers which now dominated the industry, Bass were moving away from the production of traditional ales in favour of keg beer and particularly Carling lager at Warrington, ignoring opposition from CAMRA.

In 1988, Bass acquired the rights to franchise the Holiday Inn name outside of North and South America and in 1989 went on purchase the Holiday Inn hotel chain from Holiday Corporation.

==== 1989 &quot;Beer Orders&quot; ====

During the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, beer production, distribution and retailing were vertically integrated, with the &quot;Big Six&quot; brewers (Bass among them) accounting for a large portion of UK beer production and sales. Most pubs were &quot;tied houses&quot;, owned by one of the brewers, and mostly selling its products.

On the advice of the Director-General of Fair Trading, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (later the Competition Commission) released a report entitled &quot;The Supply of Beer: A Report on the Supply of Beer for Retail Sale in the United Kingdom&quot;, investigating the nature of the beer industry. The report made recommendations to break up a &quot;complex monopoly&quot; among beer brewing and sales between the UK&#x27;s &quot;Big Six&quot; (Allied, Bass, Courage, Grand Metropolitan, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and Whitbread), which at that time accounted for &quot;75% of beer production, 74% of the brewer-owned retail estate, and 86% of loan ties.&quot; Recommendations to limit the number of pubs a brewing company could own were enacted in legislation in 1989, commonly called &quot;the Beer Orders&quot;, with three years for brewers to dispose of excess pubs. Bass went from owning approximately 7,190 pubs in 1989 to about 2,077 in 2014 (by its successor company Mitchells &amp; Butlers).

=== 21st century ===
Following decades of closures, consolidation, and the effects of the Beer Orders, Bass was left by the end of the 20th century as one of only two large remaining breweries in Burton. The Bass company decided to focus on hospitality rather than brewing and Bass&#x27; brewing business was sold to the Belgian brewer Interbrew (later Anheuser-Busch InBev) in June 2000. The UK government&#x27;s Competition Commission again raised concerns about the monopoly implications arising from the deal and instructed Interbrew to dispose of the Bass brewery facility in Burton along with the Carling and Worthington brands, which were all sold to Coors (later Molson Coors). However, Interbrew was to retain the rights to the Bass Pale Ale brand.

With only hotel and pub holdings left in the Bass company&#x27;s portfolio, the company renamed itself Six Continents plc, which itself split into Mitchells &amp; Butlers and InterContinental Hotels Group in 2003.

Bottled and keg Bass formerly exported to the US with a higher alcohol content are now produced there domestically by Anheuser-Busch at a Baldwinsville, New York, facility.

==== Fate of the original Bass brewery in Burton upon Trent ====

From 2000 to 2005, Bass was produced under licence by Molson Coors in Burton, in the original Bass brewery. When Coors&#x27; licence to brew draught Bass came to an end in 2005, a new licence was awarded to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries plc (later Marston&#x27;s plc), which transferred production of Bass to its own brewery, also in Burton. The former Bass brewery in Burton, under Molson Coors ownership, underwent renovations in the early 21st century, and as of 2021 brews Carling and other beers for the UK and European market. In 2020, the historic Bass brewery site, adjacent to the contemporary brewery, was put on the market for redevelopment.

==Brewery museum==

Sited next to the brewery, the Bass Museum of Brewing (later renamed the Coors Visitor Centre &amp; The Museum of Brewing), was Burton-upon-Trent&#x27;s largest tourist attraction until closed by Coors in June 2008. A steering group was established to investigate re-opening, and the museum was relaunched in May 2010 as the National Brewery Centre. It closed in 2022.

==Branding==

Bass was a pioneer in international brand marketing. &quot;Many years before 1855&quot; Bass applied a red triangle to casks of its Pale Ale. After 1855 the triangles were red, white or blue depending on which of three breweries it came from, but all bottles of Pale Ale had the red triangle from that date. The blue triangle was briefly revived after World War II for Pale Ale that was not bottle conditioned. The Bass Red Triangle was the first trade mark to be registered under the UK&#x27;s Trade Marks Registration Act 1875. The Act came into effect on 1 January 1876 and legend has it that a Bass employee queued overnight outside the registrar&#x27;s office on New Year&#x27;s Eve in order to be the first in line to register a trade mark the next morning. As a result, Bass, Ratcliff &amp; Gretton Limited received the first six registrations, the Bass Red Triangle for their pale ale and the Bass Red Diamond next for their strong ale (Numbers 3 to 6 have been abandoned). The trade marks are now owned by Brandbrew SA, an InBev subsidiary based in Luxembourg. In June 2013 InBev renamed Bass Pale Ale as Bass Trademark No.1.

Bottles of Bass with the Red Triangle logo have occasionally appeared in art and literature, including Édouard Manet&#x27;s 1882 painting &quot;A Bar at the Folies-Bergère&quot; and in over 40 paintings by Picasso, mostly at the height of his Cubist period around 1914. In the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; episode of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Bloom observes the Bass logo.

==Versions of Bass==
===Draught Bass===
Draught Bass is a 4.4% ABV cask conditioned beer. Most prevalent near its Burton upon Trent and Derbyshire heartlands, it is brewed by Marston&#x27;s in Burton in Yorkshire Squares using English hops and dry hopping and is described as &quot;a classic ale with a malty, fruity, nutty aroma and a complex, satisfying flavour&quot;.

Bottled Bass is not bottle conditioned, and is brewed at Samlesbury, Lancashire, by AB InBev.

===Bass Ale===
An ale brewed for export, usually to around 5% ABV.

===UK keg ales===
*Bass Extra Smooth - A 3.6% ABV pasteurised keg version of Bass, brewed to the same recipe, and most popular in the South West of England.
*Bass Mild XXXX - A 3.1% ABV keg mild.
*Bass Best Scotch - A 3.4% ABV keg beer in the North East of England Scotch ale style. It was formerly brewed to 3.8% following its launch in 1986.

===Shandy Bass===
A 1.2% (later 0.5% ABV) shandy made with Bass beer and lemonade. A Pilsner variant in a white can was also available. Introduced in 1972, it was made by Britvic. It was discontinued in 2018.

==Bass overseas==
===Belgium===
Bass Pale Ale has been brewed under licence in Belgium since the Interbrew takeover. It is typically sold in 25cl bottles at 5.2% ABV.

===United States===
Draught Bass has been exported to America since at least 1966. In 2001, 66,500,000 litres of Bass were sold in the United States. However Bass suffered under the custodianship of InBev and later Anheuser-Busch InBev as it is undergoing heavy decline in American consumption, with 24,200,000 litres sold in the country in 2010. Molson Coors pledged funding to support the Bass brand in America, and since June 2012, Bass has been brewed in Merrimack, New Hampshire, at 5% ABV for the American market.

===Elsewhere===
In 1860, Bass was the first foreign beer to be sold in Japan.

<doc id="995445" wikidata="Q838508" url="?curid=995445" title="Emilio Estefan">
<text>Emilio Estefan Gómez (born March 4, 1953) is a Cuban-American musician and producer. Estefan has won 19 Grammy Awards. He first came to prominence as a member of the Miami Sound Machine. He is the husband of singer Gloria Estefan, father of son Nayib Estefan and daughter Emily Estefan, and the uncle of Spanish-language television personality Lili Estefan.

Estefan is credited with paving the way for the crossover explosion of Latin music of the late 90s, mostly through artists that Estefan himself brought to the forefront of the US music stage, including his wife Gloria Estefan, as well as Jon Secada, Ricky Martin, and Shakira.

Estefan received the BMI &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; award in 2005 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He also received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters&#x27; Hall of Fame in 2009.

In November 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Estefan the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. In 2019 he also received the Gershwin Prize from the Library of Congress.

==Background==
Emilio Estefan Gómez was born in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba to Emilio Estefan Sr. (1919–2003) and Carmen María Gómez (1921–2006). His father Emilio Estefan Sr. was born in Cuba to Syrian and Lebanese parents and was the second child in a family which consisted of eleven siblings—many of whom were textile traders that traveled throughout Cuba and the Caribbean. Emilio Sr. was raised by his widowed mother Júlia, as his father had died when he was still a child. Carmen&#x27;s parents Antonio Gómez and Carmen Vasquez were Spanish immigrants who met while the latter was working for the Bacardi family.

In 1967, at the age of fourteen, Estefan and his father Emilio Sr. fled Cuba for Spain to escape the Castro regime. The Estefan family planned to reunite in the United States and, as a result, Carmen chose to remain behind because she did not want to abandon her parents. In addition, Estefan&#x27;s older brother José (b. 1945) was drafted into the military and could not leave Cuba until 1980. For about a year, Estefan and his father lived an impoverished life in Spain before relocating permanently to Miami, Florida. Although circumstances were far better in Miami, Estefan and Emilio Sr. still struggled as they lived in a cramped house with Estefan&#x27;s aunt and 8 cousins. Estefan did not reunite with his mother until 1971 when she was finally able to immigrate to the United States.

It was during his formative years that Estefan cultivated his musical sensibilities, as he had often used his accordion-playing skills to earn enough tips to support his father and family.

==Professional career==

=== Early music ===

In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes &quot;Merci&quot; Navarro (1957–2007) met Estefan while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band&#x27;s name changing to Miami Sound Machine. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.

Eventually, Miami Sound Machine would perform with Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo) as the lead singer and headliner.

=== Producer ===
As a producer, Estefan has shaped and developed the careers of many music superstars. His influential role in the Latin Boom of the late ‘90s and early ‘00s is reflected in his production and songwriting on albums by Shakira (&quot;Laundry Service&quot; and &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot;?), Ricky Martin (&quot;Ricky Martin&quot; and &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;), Jennifer Lopez (&quot;On the 6&quot;), Jon Secada, Marc Anthony, Thalia, and others.

He has also produced various events for both general market and Hispanic market television. These events include the Latin Grammys, Hispanic Heritage Awards, Nuestra Navidad, and some high-profile productions on HBO and Showtime. He has also produced many musical events at the White House.

In 2008, Estefan produced and directed his first full-length documentary &quot;90 Millas&quot; to showcase the history and pioneers of Cuban music.

Estefan gathered dozens of Latino entertainers in 2010 to record Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;We Are The World&quot; in Spanish. The Spanish language version, already written by Estefan and approved by Quincy Jones, became &quot;Somos El Mundo&quot;. It premiered during &quot;El Show de Cristina&quot; on March 1, 2010 and the funds went to the Haiti relief.

Also, in 2010, Estefan released his book &quot;The Rhythm of Success – How an Immigrant Produced His Own American Dream.&quot;

The following year, Estefan presented the book &quot;The Exile Experience: A Journey to Freedom&quot; in collaboration with writer Carlos Pintado and journalist Carlos Alberto Montaner, which included personal testimonials from different generations of exiles. &quot;The Exile Experience: Journey to Freedom&quot; is published in three separate editions – each tailor-made for those who arrived through Operation Pedro Pan, the Freedom Flights and the Mariel boatlift. Each edition features the names of every Cuban who arrived via one of those three exoduses, and there has been an accumulation of more than 400,000 names amongst the three editions published.

He partnered with the Nederlander Group in 2013 to produce the Broadway musical extravaganza, &quot;On Your Feet!&quot; The musical is based on the life and musical legacy of the Estefans and Fajardos. &quot;On Your Feet!&quot; premiered on Broadway in October 2015.

Estefan also became an AARP Life Reimagined ambassador in 2013. In his new role, Emilio shares his views on a variety of subjects, including living, mentoring, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy.

In February 2014, Estefan directed and produced the documentary film &quot;An Unbreakable Bond&quot; about the real&quot;-&quot;life story of father-son duo Marc and Nick Buoniconti&#x27;s undying commitment towards finding a cure for paralysis. The film premiered at National &amp; International film festivals.
In early 2014, in a decision unanimously approved by the County Commission, Estefan was appointed Miami-Dade Special Ambassador by Miami-Dade County Commissioner Jean Monestime. In his unpaid
four-year non-partisan role, Emilio was set to represent the Miami-Dade community at an international level to encourage and promote the diversity of business and trade. During the same year, Estefan and Botrán Rum created a strategic marketing alliance including a personal endorsement by Estefan. Through his role, Estefan will help promote the brand throughout the U.S., leading a multi-channel marketing campaign with the mantra &quot;The Night Begins with Botran.&quot;

Estefan sits as the second vice-chair to the commission for the National Museum of the American Latino, a bi-partisan commission charged with exploring the possibility of creating a National Latino Museum in Washington D.C.

===Other business ventures===

Gloria and Emilio Estefan own a number of business establishments, including several Cuban-themed restaurants (Bongos Cuban Café; Larios on the Beach). The restaurants are located in Miami Beach, downtown Miami (part of the American Airlines Arena), at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, Walt Disney World&#x27;s Disney Springs in Orlando, Florida, and at Miami International Airport. They also own two hotels: Costa d&#x27;Este in Vero Beach which opened in 2008, and The Cardozo in Miami Beach. In June 2009, Estefan and his wife became the first Hispanics to buy a minor ownership stake in an NFL team, the Miami Dolphins. According to articles published in &quot;People en Español&quot; and &quot;AARP Magazine&quot;, the Estefans&#x27; estimated net worth as of 2011 was approximately $700 million.

==Awards==
In 1994, Estefan was awarded the El Premio &quot;Billboard&quot; award for his work in the Latin music industry. In the same year, he was given the Excellence Award at the 1994 Lo Nuestro Awards. At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2000, Estefan received the award for Producer of the Year for his work on the albums &quot;Ciego de Amor&quot; by Charlie Zaa, &quot;El Amor de Mi Tierra&quot; by Carlos Vives and was recognized as the first Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy.

In 2002, he was appointed to the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities by President George W. Bush. In 2005, Estefan received the BMI &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Estefan has received honorary doctoral degrees from Barry University, the University of Miami, Florida International University and the Berklee College of Music. He also received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters&#x27; Hall of Fame and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2009.

Estefan was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014. In November 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Estefan and his wife Gloria with the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor—the Presidential Medal of Freedom. They were also awarded Lo Nuestro Excellence Award in 2018 and the Gershwin Prize in 2019 from the Library of Congress.

==Personal life==
Estefan became romantically involved with the Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s lead singer Gloria Fajardo in 1976. They married on September 2, 1978, and have a son, Nayib (born September 2, 1980), and a daughter, Emily (born December 5, 1994). The family lives on Star Island.

Emily is a recording artist. Nayib is an aspiring filmmaker and owner of the Nite Owl Theater in Miami. On June 5, 2010, Nayib married Lara Diamante Coppola in the backyard of his parents&#x27; house. On June 21, 2012, the first Estefan grandchild was born: grandson Sasha Argento Coppola Estefan. Gloria Estefan has said that &quot;Sasha&quot; is a name of Russian descent meaning &quot;benefactor of mankind&quot;, and was a possible name for her and Emilio&#x27;s son, Nayib.

<text>The Partners is an American sitcom that aired on September 18, 1971, through September 8, 1972, on NBC.

==Synopsis==
The program featured Don Adams and Rupert Crosse as bumbling detectives, and John Doucette their exasperated commanding officer. Dick Van Patten played the sycophantic desk sergeant. Robert Karvelas had a recurring role as Freddie, who compulsively confessed to crimes he did not commit.

The pilot featured guest appearances by Joey Forman, Art Metrano, and Yvonne Craig.

==Production notes==
Unlike many television programs of its day, &quot;The Partners&quot; eschewed a traditional opening title sequence. The opening credits were merely interspersed during the first few minutes, akin to the technique that has become quite commonplace today. The theme music, which accompanied the closing credits and occasionally popped up during the program itself, was composed by Lalo Schifrin, best known for the theme to &quot;&quot;.

==Characters==
Unlike many other sitcoms of the 1960s and 70s, there is no family seen in the show. There are not many characters altogether.

Detective Sergeant Lennie Crooke: (Don Adams) Det. Sgt. Lennie Crooke is a slightly inept police detective, a bit similar to Adams&#x27; previous character on &quot;Get Smart&quot;, Maxwell Smart. Details on his life and family are very sparse. He has mentioned on one or two occasions that he has acrophobia, and the fear of heights, and he was never in Korea, according to his statement in the pilot episode, &quot;Here Come The Fuzz&quot;. He has a likelihood to forget things that no other sane detective would forget, including his pants. He is not married and we do see him inside his apartment on one or two occasions. It appears to be very neat with every personal item in its own place. He isn&#x27;t too intelligent and is prone to get everyone in a room confused in his attempts to carry on an intelligent conversation. He tends to dislike the desk Sergeant Higgenbottem, who in turn doesn&#x27;t seem to like Lennie. The two will argue about anything, such as how &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;not&quot; true that George let me escape but it &quot;is&quot; true that I locked George in the closet, so when I said it was true, I was referring to how it wasn&#x27;t true that that was true&quot; or how &quot;They stole 13 cars in the last two weeks and that makes 14 if you count our car, but then they stole our other car which would make it 15 but then the car we found in the driveway takes it back to down to 14.&quot; To which Higgenbottem will reply, &quot;No, I&#x27;m counting both your cars and that car because whether you found it or not it was originally stolen and I&#x27;m also counting the Rolls-Royce so that makes 16.&quot; And then Lennie will continue to argue that he had forgotten the Rolls-Royce and that made it 15 again, and so they would go on until Captain Andrews put a stop to it. The two seem to rather enjoy these comical arguments, in fact. Lennie was in every episode.

Detective George Robinson: (Rupert Crosse) George is Lennie&#x27;s best friend, longtime partner, and sarcastic steadying force. He was in every episode. He is a tall black man, prone to roll his eyes and shake his head at Lennie and his antics, and even less is known about him. He was in Korea, and while he has no fear of heights, he often does seem to have a fear of Lennie&#x27;s driving. He notices things that go right over his partner&#x27;s head, and he is the one that keeps Lennie, and sometimes Higgenbottem, from making complete fools of themselves. He doesn&#x27;t seem to have a very large affinity for Higgenbottem, in fact in the pilot episode when Higgenbottom was reading the report on what the two partners had messed up, and was continually adding in pieces to the sentence that were charging the two with worse crimes, George offered to &#x27;make a suggestion that might help the situation.&#x27; -- &quot;Ask Higgenbottem to &quot;leave the room.&quot;&quot;

Captain Aaron William Andrews: (John Doucette) Captain Andrews is a sarcastic police captain, the boss of Lennie and George, who plays a role similar to that of the one Ed Platt played in Get Smart, as The Chief of CONTROL. He really does like Lennie and George in spite of his many sarcastic statements. A good example of his sarcasm: Higgenbottem, whom he is friends with, bursts into the room exclaiming that they have a &quot;code 64,&quot; Lennie tells him to take it to the animal shelter because that&#x27;s a lost dog. &quot;No, that&#x27;s a code 65.&quot; Higgenbottem said. &quot;Oh, of course,&quot; Lennie answered, &quot;I was confusing it with a code 63--&quot; &quot;Which is someone being assaulted,&quot; corrected Higginbottem, as Captain Andrews exclaimed, looking pointedly at Lennie, &quot;And we may have one in this room at any moment!&quot;

Sgt. Nelson Higgenbottem.: (Dick Van Patten) The sycophantic desk Sergeant Higgenbottom is a small man who loves any chance to grate on Lennie&#x27;s nerves and enjoys arguing with Lennie as well, only tolerates George but still looks for chances to annoy him too, and who does whatever Captain Andrews asks, and generally sides with him. Lennie has a habit of starting a sentence off with &quot;Well, at least there&#x27;s one good thing that came out of this...&quot; after he&#x27;s done something stupid. Higgenbottem always answers the same way, saying eagerly, &quot;You&#x27;re leaving the force?&quot;

Freddie Butler: Don Adams&#x27; real life cousin, Robert Karvelas, who played Agent Larabee on &quot;Get Smart&quot;, played Freddie Butler, who was in seven episodes. He is always chronically confessing to other people&#x27;s crimes, and consistently manages to drive Lennie, George, and Higgenbottem and Captain Andrews crazy. When he appears, Lennie usually exclaims, &quot;Just what I can&#x27;t stand right now, Freddie Butler!&quot;

==Reception==
NBC had exceptionally high hopes for the series after it performed well with test audiences. However, it failed to find a large enough audience because it aired Saturday nights at 8:00pm—right up against the highest-rated show on television, CBS&#x27;s &quot;All in the Family&quot;. (Originally, CBS had scheduled &quot;My Three Sons&quot; against &quot;The Partners&quot;, but substituted &quot;All in the Family&quot; at the last minute.) After their January 8, 1972, broadcasts, NBC removed both &quot;The Partners&quot; and fellow freshman sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; from its schedule. (The move worked out for the network, as they were replaced with the medical drama &quot;Emergency!&quot;, which was a hit and ran six seasons.) Fifteen episodes of the show had aired by January; five more would be &quot;burned off&quot; in the summer of 1972. The show ranked 66th out of 78 shows that season with an average 12.5 rating.

&quot;The Partners&quot; has never been officially released on home video, but several websites offer low-quality bootleg DVDs of the series.

<doc id="995449" wikidata="Q5454157" url="?curid=995449" title="First division (baseball)">
<text>First division and second division are terms in the sport of baseball referring to rankings within a league. Teams ranked in the top half of the league standings table (e.g. the top four teams in an eight-team league) are said to be in the &quot;first division&quot;, while teams in the bottom half of the standings are said to be in the &quot;second division&quot;.

The term was once closely associated with Major League Baseball (MLB). However, since the introduction of a divisional structure by MLB in , usage of the term is now uncommon.

Within MLB, the New York Yankees finished in the first division for a record 39 consecutive seasons (1926–1964) while, by comparison, the Chicago Cubs once finished in the second division for 20 seasons in a row (1947–1966).

==MLB Players&#x27; Pool==

In MLB before 1969—the establishment of divisions within each league—players on teams finishing in the first division received monetary shares from the Players&#x27; Pool, which was funded by gate receipts from that year&#x27;s World Series. The team winning the World Series received 42% of this money, the team losing the World Series got 28%, and the second-, third- and fourth-place teams in each league were awarded 7.5%, 5% and 2.5%, respectively.

With the realignment of both leagues into two geographically based divisions in 1969, the terms &quot;first division&quot; and &quot;second division&quot; quickly fell into disuse—largely because the word &quot;division&quot; had acquired a completely different meaning—although teams finishing in the top half of the standings (the first three teams in each of the new divisions) continued to share in the Players&#x27; Pool.

The distribution of the Players&#x27; Pool money was also changed with the introduction of divisional play, with the World Series winner henceforth getting 36% of the pool, its loser 27%, the losers of the League Championship Series 12.5% each, the second-place teams in the divisions 2.375% each, and the third-place teams .625% each. In 1991, these shares were revised to 36%, 24%, 12%, 3% and 1% respectively, and when both major leagues realigned again in 1995 (each league now consisting of three divisions, the winners thereof plus one wild card team in each league reaching the postseason), the 3% shares went to teams losing in the Division Series and the 1% shares went to the teams that finished second in their division but did not earn a wild card.</text><links>

<text>The Opeongo River is a river in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in Nipissing District in northeastern Ontario, Canada. The river is entirely within Algonquin Provincial Park and Opeongo River Provincial Park, except for a small portion around Victoria Lake, and is a left tributary of the Madawaska River.

==Course==
The river begins in Algonquin Provincial Park at the outflow from Annie Bay on the East Arm of Opeongo Lake in geographic Preston Township, in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District, controlled by the Opeongo Lake Dam and flows southeast to Booth Lake. It exits the lake east controlled by the Booth Lake Dam, enters geographic Clancy Township, exits Algonquin Provincial Park into Opeongo River Provincial Park and reaches Victoria Lake. The river leaves the lake at the northeast over a dam and continues southeast, passes from Unorganized South Nipissing District into the geographic Dickens Township in the municipality of South Algonquin, passes through a series of rapids, takes in the left tributary Aylen River, turns southwest, and empties into Bark Lake on the Madawaska River, at the Ontario Highway 60 bridge and east of the community of Madawaska. The Madawaska River flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River.

==Recreation==
The river is used for recreational canoeing and kayaking.

<doc id="995453" wikidata="Q8023404" url="?curid=995453" title="Wilton Windmill">
<text>The Wilton Windmill is a five-floor brick tower mill, standing on a chalk ridge between the villages of Wilton and Great Bedwyn in the southern English county of Wiltshire.

==History==
The mill was built in 1821 because the construction of the Kennet and Avon Canal had included the canalisation of the River Bedwyn which had previously powered several water mills in the area.

The windmill was in use for a century, continuing into the 1920s, but fell into disuse, probably as the result of competition from large steam roller mills. In the 1960s it was added to the list of buildings of architectural or historical merit as Grade II*. In 1971 it was bought by Wiltshire County Council and leased to the Wiltshire Historic Buildings Trust, which early in 1972 began to restore it to working condition. By the end of the summer of 1976 the windmill was once again making flour.

It is now owned by Wiltshire Council and managed by the Wilton Windmill Society, formed in 1976 and operated entirely by volunteers. In the 1980s the mill was in financial difficulties, which led to the Society forming a cricket XI, the Wilton Millers&#x27; Cricket Team, to raise funds by playing sponsored matches, and in 2011 this was still in existence, although no longer needed for fundraising.

Flour, made from locally grown wheat, is still produced at the mill and can be bought on site and in local shops.

==Sails==

As when it was first constructed, the mill has a fantail, which causes the cap bearing the sails to turn to make best use of the available wind. Of the four sails, two are of canvas and two are more complicated &quot;patent sails&quot;, each consisting of twenty-two sections which can be angled.

==Culture and media==
Wilton Windmill featured in an episode of &quot;Victorian Farm Christmas&quot;, first aired on BBC Two on 11 December 2009. It also appeared in the short film &quot;Jerusalem&quot; starring pop group The Style Council, filmed in 1986 for a direct to video release in 1987; in the film the band performs the song &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Above&quot; at the windmill.

<doc id="995461" wikidata="Q3537455" url="?curid=995461" title="Bangle">
<text>Bangles are traditionally rigid bracelets which are usually made of metal, wood, glass or plastic. These ornaments are worn mostly by women in the Indian subcontinent, Southeastern Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. It is common to see a bride wearing glass bangles at weddings in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and in other Asian countries. Bangles may also be worn by young girls, and bangles made of gold or silver are preferred for toddlers. Some men and women wear a single bangle on the arm or wrist called &quot;kada&quot; or &quot;kara&quot;. 

Chooda is a kind of bangle that is worn by Hindu/Sikh Punjabi women on their wedding day. It is a set of white and red bangles with stonework. 

According to tradition, a woman is not supposed to buy the bangles she will wear. 

Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh is India&#x27;s largest producer of bangles.

==History==

Bangles made from sea shell, copper, bronze, gold, agate, chalcedony, etc. have been excavated from multiple archaeological sites throughout the Indian subcontinent. A figurine of a dancing girl wearing bangles on her left arm has been excavated from the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site (2600 BC) in modern-day Pakistan.
Other early examples of bangles in ancient India include copper samples from the excavations at Mahurjhari, followed by the decorated bangles belonging to the Mauryan Empire (322–185 BC) and the gold bangle samples from the historic site of Taxila (6th century BC). Decorated shell bangles have also been excavated from multiple Mauryan sites. Other features include copper rivets and gold-leaf inlay in some cases.

==Design==
Bangles are circular in shape, and, unlike other bracelets, are not flexible. The word is derived from Hindi (glass). They are made of numerous precious as well as non-precious materials such as gold, silver, platinum, glass, wood, ferrous metals, plastic, etc. Bangles made from sea shell, which are white colour, are worn by married Bengali and Oriya Hindu women. A special type of bangle is worn by women and girls, especially in the Bengal area, commonly known as a &quot;Bengali bangle&quot;, which is used as a substitute for a costly gold bangle, and is produced by thermo-mechanically fusing a thin gold strip (weighing between 1–3 g) onto a bronze bangle, followed by manual crafting on that fused gold strip.

Bangles are part of traditional Indian subcontinent jewellery. They are sometimes worn in pairs by women, one or more on each arm. It is also common for women to wear a single bangle or several bangles on just one wrist. Most Indian women prefer wearing either gold or glass bangles or a combination of both. Inexpensive bangles made from plastic are slowly replacing those made by glass, but the ones made of glass are still preferred at traditional occasions such as marriages and on festivals. Bangles are the signs for traditional women and girls. Bangles play a very important role in various Indian dance forms. Some of dance forms include bangles striking each other to produce a tone.

The designs range from simple to intricate handmade designs, often studded with precious and semi-precious stones such as diamonds, gems and pearls. Sets of expensive bangles made of gold and silver make a jingling sound. The imitation jewellery tends to make a tinny sound when jingled.

==Types==
There are two basic types of bangles: a solid cylinder type; and a split, cylindrical spring opening/closing type. The primary distinguishing factor between these is the material used to make the bangles. This may vary from anything from glass to jade to metal to lac and even rubber or plastic.

One factor that adds to the price of the bangles is the artifacts or the further work done on the metal. This includes embroidery or small glass pieces or paintings or even small hangings that are attached to the bangles. The rareness of a colour and its uniqueness also increase the value. Bangles made from lac are one of the oldest types and among the brittlest. Lac is a resinous material, secreted by insects, which is collected and moulded in hot kilns to make these bangles. Among the more recent kinds are rubber bangles, worn more like a wristband by youngsters, and plastic ones which add a trendy look.

Normally, a bangle worn by people around the world is simply an inflexible piece of jewellery worn around the wrist. However, in many cultures, especially those from Indian cultures and the broader Indian subcontinent, bangles have evolved into various types in which different ones are used on different occasions.

The following are some popular designs of bangles in India:-

# Jadau Bangles (Also known as Kundan);
# Meenakari Bangles;
# Lac or Lakhs Bangles.
Bangles, in India, are usually used by married women or girls. A chura is a set of Bangles traditionally worn by a bride on her wedding day and for a period after, especially in Punjabi weddings.

==Production==
*Hyderabad, India, has a historic world-famous market for bangles named Laad Bazaar.
*Glass bangles are mostly produced in the old Indian city of Firozabad in North India.
*In Pakistan, glass bangles are produced mainly in Hyderabad, Sindh and plastic full arm bangles are produced in Tharparkar, Badin, Umerkot and Sanghar.
