<text>Early Modern English (sometimes abbreviated EModE or EMnE) or Early New English (ENE) is the stage of the English language from the beginning of the Tudor period to the English Interregnum and Restoration, or from the transition from Middle English, in the late 15th century, to the transition to Modern English, in the mid-to-late 17th century.

Before and after the accession of James I to the English throne in 1603, the emerging English standard began to influence the spoken and written Middle Scots of Scotland.

The grammatical and orthographical conventions of literary English in the late 16th century and the 17th century are still very influential on modern Standard English. Most modern readers of English can understand texts written in the late phase of Early Modern English, such as the &quot;King James Bible&quot; and the works of William Shakespeare, and they have greatly influenced Modern English.

Texts from the earlier phase of Early Modern English, such as the late-15th-century &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1485) and the mid-16th-century &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561), may present more difficulties but are still closer to Modern English grammar, lexicon and phonology than are 14th-century Middle English texts, such as the works of Geoffrey Chaucer.

==History==
===English Renaissance===
====Transition from Middle English====

The change from Middle English to Early Modern English affected much more than just vocabulary and pronunciation.

Middle English underwent significant change over time and contained large dialectical variations. Early Modern English, on the other hand, became more standardised and developed an established canon of literature that survives today.
*1476 – William Caxton started printing in Westminster; however, the language that he used reflected the variety of styles and dialects used by the authors who originally wrote the material.

=====Tudor period (1485–1603)=====
*1485 – Caxton published Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the first print bestseller in English. Malory&#x27;s language, while archaic in some respects, was clearly Early Modern and was possibly a Yorkshire or Midlands dialect.
*1491 or 1492 – Richard Pynson started printing in London; his style tended to prefer Chancery Standard, the form of English used by the government.

====Henry VIII====
* 1509 – Pynson became the king&#x27;s official printer.
*From 1525 – Publication of William Tyndale&#x27;s Bible translation, which was initially banned.
*1539 – Publication of the &quot;Great Bible&quot;, the first officially authorised Bible in English. Edited by Myles Coverdale, it was largely from the work of Tyndale. It was read to congregations regularly in churches, which familiarised much of the population of England with a standard form of the language.
*1549 – Publication of the first edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in English, under the supervision of Thomas Cranmer (revised in 1552, 1559, 1604, and 1662), which standardised much of the wording of church services. Some have argued that since attendance at prayer book services was required by law for many years, the repetitive use of its language helped to standardise Modern English even more than the &quot;King James Bible&quot; (1611) did.
*1557 – Publication of &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;.

====Elizabethan English====

;Elizabethan era (1558–1603)
*1560 – The Geneva Bible was published. The New Testament was completed in 1557 by English Reformed exiles on the continent during the reign of Mary, and the complete Bible three years later, after Elizabeth succeeded the throne. This version was favoured by the Puritans and Pilgrims due to its more vigorous and forceful language. Its popularity and proliferation (due in large part to its copious notes) over the following decades sparked the production of the King James Bible to counter it.
*1582 – The Rheims and Douai Bible was completed, and the New Testament was released in Rheims, France, in 1582. It was the first complete English translation of the Bible that was officially sponsored and carried out by the Catholic Church (earlier translations into English, especially of the Psalms and Gospels, existed as far back as the 9th century, but it was the first Catholic English translation of the full Bible). Though the Old Testament was already complete, it was not published until 1609–1610, when it was released in two volumes. While it did not make a large impact on the English language at large, it certainly played a role in the development of English, especially in heavily Catholic English-speaking areas.
*Christopher Marlowe, 
*1592 – &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; by Thomas Kyd
* – Shakespeare&#x27;s plays written 
===17th century===
====Jacobean and Caroline eras====
=====Jacobean era (1603–1625)=====

*1609 – Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets published
*Other playwrights:
**Ben Jonson
**Thomas Dekker
**Beaumont and Fletcher (Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher)
**John Webster
*1607 – The first successful permanent English colony in the New World, Jamestown, is established in Virginia. Early vocabulary specific to American English comes from indigenous languages (such as moose, racoon).
*1611 – The &quot;King James Version&quot; was published, largely based on Tyndale&#x27;s translation. It remained the standard Bible in the Church of England into the latter half of the twentieth century.
*1623 – Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;First Folio&quot; published

=====Caroline era and English Civil War (1625–1649)=====

*1630–1651 – William Bradford, Governor of Plymouth Colony, wrote his journal. It will become &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot;, one of the earliest texts written in the American Colonies.
*1647 – Publication of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio

====Interregnum and Restoration====
The English Civil War and the Interregnum were times of social and political upheaval and instability.
The dates for Restoration literature are a matter of convention and differ markedly from genre to genre. In drama, the &quot;Restoration&quot; may last until 1700, but in poetry, it may last only until 1666, the &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; (year of wonders), and in prose lasts until 1688. With the increasing tensions over succession and the corresponding rise in journalism and periodicals, or until possibly 1700, when those periodicals grew more stabilised.
*1651 – Publication of &quot;Leviathan&quot; by Thomas Hobbes.
*1660–1669 – Samuel Pepys wrote his diary, which will become an important eyewitness account of the Restoration Era.
*1662 – New edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, largely based on the 1549 and subsequent editions. It long remained a standard work in English.
*1667 – Publication of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by John Milton and of &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; by John Dryden.

===Development to Modern English===

The 17th-century port towns and their forms of speech gained influence over the old county towns. From around the 1690s onwards, England experienced a new period of internal peace and relative stability, which encouraged the arts including literature.

Modern English can be taken to have emerged fully by the beginning of the Georgian era in 1714, but English orthography remained somewhat fluid until the publication of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, in 1755.

The towering importance of William Shakespeare over the other Elizabethan authors was the result of his reception during the 17th and the 18th centuries, which directly contributes to the development of Standard English. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are therefore still familiar and comprehensible 400 years after they were written, but the works of Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland, which had been written only 200 years earlier, are considerably more difficult for the average modern reader.

==Orthography==

The orthography of Early Modern English is recognisably similar to that of today, but spelling was unstable. Early Modern and Modern English both retain various orthographical conventions that predate the Great Vowel Shift.

Early Modern English spelling was broadly similar to that encountered in Middle English. Some of the changes that occurred were based on etymology (as with the silent that was added to words like , and ). Many spellings had still not been standardised. For example, &quot;he&quot; was spelled as both and in the same sentence in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and elsewhere.

Certain key orthographic features of Early Modern English spelling have not been retained:
*The letter had two distinct lowercase forms: (short &quot;s&quot;), as is still used today, and (long &quot;s&quot;). The short &quot;s&quot; was always used at the end of a word and often elsewhere. The long &quot;s&quot;, if used, could appear anywhere except at the end of a word. The double lowercase &quot;S&quot; was written variously , or (the last ligature is still used in German ß). That is similar to the alternation between medial (σ) and final lowercase sigma (ς) in Greek.
* and  were not considered two distinct letters then but as still different forms of the same letter. Typographically, was frequent at the start of a word and elsewhere: hence &quot;&quot; (for modern &quot;unmoved&quot;) and (for &quot;love&quot;). The modern convention of using for the vowel sounds and for the consonant appears to have been introduced in the 1630s. Also, was frequently represented by .
*Similarly,  and  were also still considered not as two distinct letters, but as different forms of the same letter: hence &quot;&quot; for &quot;joy&quot; and for &quot;just&quot;. Again, the custom of using as a vowel and as a consonant began in the 1630s.
*The letter (thorn) was still in use during the Early Modern English period but was increasingly limited to handwritten texts. In Early Modern English printing, was represented by the Latin (see Ye olde), which appeared similar to thorn in blackletter typeface . Thorn had become nearly totally disused by the late Early Modern English period, the last vestiges of the letter being its ligatures, (thee), (that), (thou), which were still seen occasionally in the 1611 &quot;King James Version&quot; and in Shakespeare&#x27;s Folios.
*A silent was often appended to words, as in &#x27; and &#x27;. The last consonant was sometimes doubled when the was added: hence &#x27; (for &quot;man&quot;) and &#x27; (for &quot;run&quot;).
*The sound was often written (as in &quot;son&quot;): hence &#x27;, &#x27; (for modern &quot;summer&quot;, &quot;plumb&quot;).
*The final syllable of words like &quot;public&quot; was variously spelt but came to be standardised as &quot;-ick&quot;. The modern spellings with &quot;-ic&quot; did not come into use until the mid-18th century.
* was often used instead of .
*The vowels represented by and (for example in &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;&quot;) changed, and became an alternative.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

Most consonant sounds of Early Modern English have survived into present-day English; however, there are still a few notable differences in pronunciation:
*Today&#x27;s &quot;silent&quot; consonants found in the consonant clusters of such words as &quot;knot, gnat, sword&quot; were still fully pronounced up until the mid-to-late 16th century and thus possibly by Shakespeare, though they were fully reduced by the early 17th century.
*The digraph , in words like &quot;night&quot;, &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot;, originally pronounced in much older English, was probably reduced to nothing (as it is today) or at least heavily reduced in sound to something like , , , or . It seems likely that much variation existed for many of these words. Upon its disappearance, it lengthened the previous vowel.
*The now-silent &quot;l&quot; of &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; may have persisted in being pronounced as late as 1700 in Britain and perhaps several decades longer in the British American colonies. The &quot;l&quot; in &quot;could&quot;, however, first appearing in the early 16th century, was presumably never pronounced.
*The modern phoneme was not documented as occurring until the second half of the 17th century. Likely, that phoneme in a word like &quot;vision&quot; was pronounced as and in &quot;measure&quot; as .
*Most words with the spelling , such as &quot;what&quot;, &quot;where&quot; and &quot;whale&quot;, were still pronounced , rather than . That means, for example, that &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;whine&quot; were still pronounced differently, unlike in most varieties of English today.
*Early Modern English was rhotic. In other words, the &quot;r&quot; was always pronounced, but the precise nature of the typical rhotic consonant remains unclear. It was, however, certainly one of the following:
**The &quot;R&quot; of most varieties of English today: or a further forward sound 
**The &quot;trilled or rolled R&quot;: , perhaps with one contact , as in modern Scouse and Scottish English
**The &quot;retroflex R&quot;: . 
*In Early Modern English, the precise nature of the light and dark variants of the &quot;l&quot; consonant, respectively and , remains unclear.
*Word-final , as in &quot;sing&quot;, was still pronounced until the late 16th century, when it began to coalesce into the usual modern pronunciation, . The original pronunciation is preserved in parts of England, in dialects such as Brummie, Mancunian and Scouse.
*H-dropping at the start of words was common, as it still is in informal English throughout most of England. In loanwords taken from Latin, Greek, or any Romance language, a written &quot;h&quot; was usually mute well into modern English times, e.g. in &quot;heritage&quot;, &quot;history&quot;, &quot;hermit&quot;, &quot;hostage&quot;, and still today in &quot;heir&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;hour&quot; etc.
*With words originating from or passed through ancient Greek, &quot;th&quot; was commonly pronounced as &quot;t&quot;, e.g. &quot;theme&quot;, &quot;theater&quot;, &quot;cathedral&quot;, &quot;anthem&quot;; this is still retained in some proper names as &quot;Thomas&quot; and a few common nouns like &quot;thyme&quot;.

===Vowels===

The following information primarily comes from studies of the Great Vowel Shift; see the related chart.
*The modern English phoneme , as in &quot;glide&quot;, &quot;rhyme&quot; and &quot;eye&quot;, was , and was reduced word-finally. Early Modern rhymes indicate that was similar to the vowel that was used at the end of words like &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;melody&quot; and &quot;busy&quot;.
*, as in &quot;now&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and &quot;ploughed&quot;, was .
*, as in &quot;fed&quot;, &quot;elm&quot; and &quot;hen&quot;, was more or less the same as the phoneme represents today, sometimes approaching (which is still in the word &quot;pretty&quot;).
* , as in &quot;name&quot;, &quot;case&quot; and &quot;sake&quot;, was a long monophthong. It shifted from to and finally to . Earlier in Early Modern English, &quot;mat&quot; and &quot;mate&quot; were near-homophones, with a longer vowel in the second word. Thus, Shakespeare rhymed words like &quot;haste&quot;, &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; with &quot;last&quot; and &quot;shade&quot; with &quot;sad&quot;. The more open pronunciation remains in some Northern England English and rarely in Irish English. During the 17th century, the phoneme variably merged with the phoneme as in &quot;day&quot;, &quot;weigh&quot;, and the merger survived into standard forms of Modern English, though a few dialects kept these vowels distinct at least to the 20th century (see &quot;pane&quot;–&quot;pain&quot; merger).
* (typically spelled or ) as in &quot;see&quot;, &quot;bee&quot; and &quot;meet&quot;, was more or less the same as the phoneme represents today, but it had not yet merged with the phoneme represented by the spellings or (and perhaps , particularly with &quot;fiend&quot;, &quot;field&quot; and &quot;friend&quot;), as in &quot;east&quot;, &quot;meal&quot; and &quot;feat&quot;, which were pronounced with or . However, words like &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;head&quot; may have already split off towards ).
*, as in &quot;bib&quot;, &quot;pin&quot; and &quot;thick&quot;, was more or less the same as the phoneme represents today.
*, as in &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;bode&quot; and &quot;yolk&quot;, was or . The phoneme was probably just beginning the process of merging with the phoneme , as in &quot;grow&quot;, &quot;know&quot; and &quot;mow&quot;, without yet achieving today&#x27;s complete merger. The old pronunciation remains in some dialects, such as in Yorkshire, East Anglia, and Scotland.
*, as in &quot;rod&quot;, &quot;top&quot; and &quot;pot&quot;, was or , much like the corresponding RP sound.
*, as in &quot;taut&quot;, &quot;taught&quot; and &quot;law&quot; was more open than in contemporary RP, being or (and thus being closer to Welsh and General American )
*, as in &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;toy&quot;, is even less clear than other vowels. In the late 16th century, the similar but distinct phonemes , and all existed. By the late 17th century, they all merged. Because those phonemes were in such a state of flux during the whole Early Modern period (with evidence of rhyming occurring among them as well as with the precursor to ), scholars often assume only the most neutral possibility for the pronunciation of as well as its similar phonemes in Early Modern English: (which, if accurate, would constitute an early instance of the line–loin merger since had not yet fully developed in English).
* (as in &quot;drum&quot;, &quot;enough&quot; and &quot;love&quot;) and (as in &quot;could&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, &quot;put&quot;) had not yet split and so were both pronounced in the vicinity of .
* occurred not only in words like &quot;food&quot;, &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;stool&quot;, but also all other words spelled with like &quot;blood&quot;, &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;foot&quot;. However, the vowel for some of those words was shortened at an early stage: either beginning or already in the process of approximating the Early Modern English . That phonological split among the words was a catalyst for the later foot–strut split and is called &quot;early shortening&quot; by John C. Wells. The words that came to be pronounced with the shortened vowel included, for example, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;blood&quot;. They, like other words with /ʊ/, were subsequently subject to the foot–strut split and many of them, like &quot;drum&quot; and &quot;love&quot;, came to be pronounced with the vowel and eventually . However, the words with a shortened vowel also seem to have included, at least in some pronunciations such as Shakespeare&#x27;s and at certain stages, some words that are pronounced with the original non-shortened vowel in Present-Day English - e.g. &quot;brood&quot;, &quot;doom&quot; and &quot;noon&quot;. For example, &quot;doom&quot; and &quot;come&quot; rhyme in Shakespeare&#x27;s writing for this reason.
* or occurred in words spelled with &quot;ew&quot; or &quot;ue&quot; such as &quot;due&quot; and &quot;dew&quot;. In most dialects of Modern English, it became and by yod-dropping and so &quot;do&quot;, &quot;dew&quot; and &quot;due&quot; are now perfect homophones in most American pronunciations, but a distinction between the two phonemes remains in other versions of English. There is, however, an additional complication in dialects with yod-coalescence (such as Australian English and younger RP), in which &quot;dew&quot; and &quot;due&quot; (homophonous with &quot;jew&quot;) are distinguished from &quot;do&quot; purely by the initial consonant, without any vowel distinction.

The difference between the transcription of the EME diphthong offsets with , as opposed to the usual modern English transcription with is not meaningful in any way. The precise EME realizations are not known, and they vary even in modern English.

=== Rhoticity/rhotic vowels ===
The &quot;r&quot; sound (the phoneme ) was probably always pronounced with following vowel sounds (more in the style of today&#x27;s General American, West Country English, Irish accents and Scottish accents, although in the case of the Scottish accent the R is rolled, and less like the pronunciation now usual in most of England.)

Furthermore, at the beginning of the Early Modern English period there were three non-open and non-schwa short vowels before in the syllable coda: , and (roughly equivalent to modern , and ; had not yet developed). In London English they gradually merged into a phoneme that became modern . By the time of Shakespeare, the spellings , and perhaps when they had a short vowel, as in &quot;clerk&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, or &quot;divert&quot;, had an &quot;a&quot;-like quality, perhaps about or . With the spelling , the sound may have been backed, more toward in words like &quot;worth&quot; and &quot;word&quot;.

In some pronunciations, words like &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;fear&quot;, with the spellings and , rhymed with each other, and words with the spelling , such as &quot;prepare&quot; and &quot;compare&quot;, were sometimes pronounced with a more open vowel sound, like the verbs &quot;are&quot; and &quot;scar&quot;. See for more information.

===Specific words===
&quot;Nature&quot; was pronounced approximately as and may have rhymed with &quot;letter&quot; or, early on, even &quot;latter&quot;. &quot;One&quot; may have been pronounced &quot;own&quot;, with both &quot;one&quot; and &quot;other&quot; using the era&#x27;s long vowel, rather than today&#x27;s vowels. &quot;Tongue&quot; derived from the sound of &quot;tong&quot; and rhymed with &quot;song&quot;.

==Grammar==
===Pronouns===
Early Modern English had two second-person personal pronouns: &quot;thou&quot;, the informal singular pronoun, and &quot;ye&quot;, the plural (both formal and informal) pronoun and the formal singular pronoun.

&quot;Thou&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; were both common in the early 16th century (they can be seen, for example, in the disputes over Tyndale&#x27;s translation of the Bible in the 1520s and the 1530s) but by 1650, &quot;thou&quot; seems old-fashioned or literary. It has effectively completely disappeared from Modern Standard English.

The translators of the &quot;King James Version&quot; of the Bible (begun 1604 and published 1611, while Shakespeare was at the height of his popularity) had a particular reason for keeping the informal &quot;thou/thee/thy/thine/thyself&quot; forms that were slowly beginning to fall out of spoken use, as it enabled them to match the Hebrew and Ancient Greek distinction between second person singular (&quot;thou&quot;) and plural (&quot;ye&quot;). It was not to denote reverence (in the &quot;King James Version&quot;, God addresses individual people and even Satan as &quot;thou&quot;) but only to denote the singular. Over the centuries, however, the very fact that &quot;thou&quot; was dropping out of normal use gave it a special aura and so it gradually and ironically came to be used to express reverence in hymns and in prayers.

Like other personal pronouns, &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; have different forms dependent on their grammatical case; specifically, the objective form of &quot;thou&quot; is &quot;thee&quot;, its possessive forms are &quot;thy&quot; and &quot;thine&quot;, and its reflexive or emphatic form is &quot;thyself&quot;.

The objective form of &quot;ye&quot; was &quot;you&quot;, its possessive forms are &quot;your&quot; and &quot;yours&quot; and its reflexive or emphatic forms are &quot;yourself&quot; and &quot;yourselves&quot;.

The older forms &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;thine&quot; had become &quot;my&quot; and &quot;thy&quot; before words beginning with a consonant other than &quot;h&quot;, and &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;thine&quot; were retained before words beginning with a vowel or an &quot;h&quot;, as in &quot;mine eyes&quot; or &quot;thine hand&quot;.
===Verbs===
====Tense and number====
During the Early Modern period, the verb inflections became simplified as they evolved towards their modern forms:
*The third-person singular present lost its alternate inflections: &quot;-eth&quot; and &quot;-th&quot; became obsolete, and &quot;-s&quot; survived. (Both forms can be seen together in Shakespeare: &quot;With her, that &quot;hateth&quot; thee and &quot;hates&quot; us all&quot;.)
*The plural present form became uninflected. Present plurals had been marked with &quot;-en&quot; and singulars with &quot;-th&quot; or &quot;-s&quot; (&quot;-th&quot; and &quot;-s&quot; survived the longest, especially with the singular use of &quot;is&quot;, &quot;hath&quot; and &quot;doth&quot;). Marked present plurals were rare throughout the Early Modern period and &quot;-en&quot; was probably used only as a stylistic affectation to indicate rural or old-fashioned speech.
*The second-person singular indicative was marked in both the present and past tenses with &quot;-st&quot; or &quot;-est&quot; (for example, in the past tense, &quot;walkedst&quot; or &quot;gav&#x27;st&quot;). Since the indicative past was not and still is not otherwise marked for person or number, the loss of &quot;thou&quot; made the past subjunctive indistinguishable from the indicative past for all verbs except &quot;to be&quot;.

====Modal auxiliaries====
The modal auxiliaries cemented their distinctive syntactical characteristics during the Early Modern period. Thus, the use of modals without an infinitive became rare (as in &quot;I must to Coventry&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;ll none of that&quot;). The use of modals&#x27; present participles to indicate aspect (as in &quot;Maeyinge suffer no more the loue &amp; deathe of Aurelio&quot; from 1556), and of their preterite forms to indicate tense (as in &quot;he follow&#x27;d Horace so very close, that of necessity he must fall with him&quot;) also became uncommon.

Some verbs ceased to function as modals during the Early Modern period. The present form of &quot;must&quot;, &quot;mot&quot;, became obsolete. &quot;Dare&quot; also lost the syntactical characteristics of a modal auxiliary and evolved a new past form (&quot;dared&quot;), distinct from the modal &quot;durst&quot;.

====Perfect and progressive forms====
The perfect of the verbs had not yet been standardised to use only the auxiliary verb &quot;to have&quot;. Some took as their auxiliary verb &quot;to be&quot;, such as this example from the &quot;King James Version&quot;: &quot;But which of you... will say unto him... when he is come from the field, Go and sit down...&quot; [Luke XVII:7]. The rules for the auxiliaries for different verbs were similar to those that are still observed in German and French (see unaccusative verb).

The modern syntax used for the progressive aspect (&quot;I am walking&quot;) became dominant by the end of the Early Modern period, but other forms were also common such as the prefix &quot;a-&quot; (&quot;I am a-walking&quot;) and the infinitive paired with &quot;do&quot; (&quot;I do walk&quot;). Moreover, the &quot;to be&quot; + -&quot;ing&quot; verb form could be used to express a passive meaning without any additional markers: &quot;The house is building&quot; could mean &quot;The house is being built&quot;.

==Vocabulary==
A number of words that are still in common use in Modern English have undergone semantic narrowing.

The use of the verb &quot;to suffer&quot; in the sense of &quot;to allow&quot; survived into Early Modern English, as in the phrase &quot;suffer the little children&quot; of the &quot;King James Version&quot;, but it has mostly been lost in Modern English. This use still exists in the idiom &quot;to suffer fools gladly&quot;.

Also, this period includes one of the earliest Russian borrowings to English (which is historically a rare occasion itself); at least as early as 1600, the word &quot;steppe&quot; (rus. степь) first appeared in English in William Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. It is believed that this is a possible indirect borrowing via either German or French.

The substantial borrowing of Latin and sometimes Greek words for abstract concepts, begun in Middle English, continued unabated, often terms for abstract concepts not available in English.

<text>.sa is the Latin alphabet Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Saudi Arabia. Domains of this type can be registered through SaudiNIC, a department of the Communications and Information Technology Commission. The Arabic alphabet ccTLD of Saudi Arabia is السعودية.

== History ==
The top-level domain was managed by the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology from 1995 to 2006. It was then transferred to Saudi Network Information Center (SaudiNIC).

As of 21 August 2023, 54,330 domain names were registered.

== Second-level domains ==
The second-level domains that are officially open to third-level registrations are:

* : Commercial entities and registered trademarks
* : Educational institutions
* : Elementary and secondary schools
* : Health services (hospitals, clinics, etc.)
* : Governmental entities
* : Internet-related services (ISPs, web hosting, portal sites, etc.)
* : Non-profit organizations
* : Entities or individuals that do not fit in other categories, including personal names.

==Internationalized country code TLD==
Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to apply for the new internationalized domain name (IDN) country code top-level domains authorized by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 2009. In January 2010, ICANN announced that the Saudi IDN ccTLD (xn--mgberp4a5d4ar, السعودية) one of the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process.

<text>The River Loddon is a tributary of the River Thames in southern England. It rises at Basingstoke in Hampshire and flows northwards for to meet the Thames at Wargrave in Berkshire. Together, the Loddon and its tributaries drain an area of .

The river had many active mills, and has many remnants of flow modifications by the building up of mill pond reaches with weirs and sluices and the adjacent mill races (also called leats). Most of these used wheels to generate their power – two used water turbines. One was a silk mill for a short period, and one a paper mill, with the rest milling corn or producing flour. Several have been converted to become homes or hotels, but Longbridge Mill has been restored and still operates occasionally. The river has been used for recreational and possibly minor commercial navigation and in drier spells it can be safely canoed in some places.

The Loddon is a habitat for diverse wildlife. Former gravel workings have become Loddon Nature Reserve and Dinton Pastures Country Park. A section of it is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest due to rare populations of bulbs and pondweed. Improvements made to the river under the Water Framework Directive, have included the installation of a fish bypass at Arborfield Mill for migratory species including salmon.

==Course==
The Loddon rises at West Ham Farm, and two springs north of Bramblys Drive, in Basingstoke, and in its first mile flows under the Festival Place shopping centre of the town centre. The main bus station takes up where the wharf stood by what is no longer the Basingstoke Canal, its westernmost three miles having been filled in. The river emerges again in Eastrop Park, where it runs alongside Eastrop Way which supersedes the disused canal reach, on the park stood Basingstoke Corn Mill in 1873, but by 1932 it was called Vince&#x27;s Farm, mill buildings still spanning the river. The river then passes through water-meadows where it is joined by small streams from the springs and reduced ponds of the north of Black Dam. These had to drain under a wide bend of canal embankment. Basingstoke Upper Mill stood south, 14 metres west of Redbridge Lane, still a corn mill in 1873, fields by 1932, now woodland by a multi-lane roundabout.

Where the flows meet is woodland that was &quot;the&quot; peat moor, at this point watercress was latterly grown such as in 1961. The Basingstoke Union Workhouse and added workhouse infirmary, stood where the Hampshire Clinic stands, a private hospital. East is the older third of Old Basing and the ruins of medieval Basing House (and Tudor/Jacobean house, north) below an old citadel with remnant ramparts and defensive walls.

A brick railway viaduct of four arches crosses – the South West Main Line. The house that was Old Basing Mill, a corn mill in 1932, Barton&#x27;s Mill, is 95 metres north. Early 20th century watercress beds continued just north. A suburban hill road with access to a wooded east Basingstoke neighbourhood and key roads of Old Basing are linked by a brick, three-arch bridge of three arches over the Loddon; funded by public subscription, it opened in 1826. Immediately below, the river widens, as it formed a head of water (mill pond) for the Lower Mill, a corn mill in 1872, disused by 1932.

The river curves northward in a series of bends, past north Hampshire farms and a woodland-set golf course on the west bank in the south. Geodesically for two channels co-exist, often the northern being considered &quot;upper&quot;. Petty&#x27;s Brook (next to the town&#x27;s main sewage works) joins, then after just under double that distance the Lyde joins, flowing from east of Old Basing. At Sherfield on Loddon, Longbridge Mill stands above Long Bridge of the main road to Reading, Berkshire. North, the river is joined the Bow Brook. The two flows sandwich the north half of Sherfield. Bow Brook rises about the same distance as the Loddon&#x27;s source, but west, as four streams around Pamber End. The Loddon then passes: Lilly Mill, Lilly Mill Farm; fields; Broadford Bridge for a lane; rectory gardens/fields; Stratfield Saye church; and the ornamental grounds of Stratfield Saye House, the home of every Duke of Wellington since the first received that highest ennoblement in 1817 for leading in the Battle of Waterloo. In the park is a cast iron grade II* listed bridge of Thomas Wilson, 1802, design. Two-arch, thick-buttressed, Stanfordend Bridge – under which the Loddon enters its second and last county, Berkshire – marks the northern end of the park, against a skirting of woodland and is likewise listed. It bears the date 1787. Its namesake flour mill lay north, disused by 1961.

Past fields and scattered copses the river undershoots: the A33 road (bypassing Swallowfield), the lane borne by King&#x27;s Bridge, then the bridge of Basingstoke Road next to Sheepbridge Mill (a corn mill in 1872, a hotel since 1968). Two fields north, the flow is more than doubled by the Blackwater.

After many fields and a little woodland the A327 takes Arborfield Bridge on which sits that house that served as Arborfield Paper Mill, out of production by 1899. To left are meadows and woodland, to right fields. The M4 bridge follows. After of meadows (and the main outlet of Barkham Brook having meandered north from Barkham), Mill Lane crosses by Sindlesham Mill, extended to north to make a many-roomed hotel – in centuries past milling grain into flour. The meadows and those below abut the eastern suburbs of Berkshire: Earley and, downstream, Woodley, between which places and Winnersh five road bridges and a rail bridge stand.

The largest bridge carries the A3290, and has a construction defect, of 1972, see A329(M) motorway and Loddon Bridge disaster.

The course is then in the west part of Dinton Pastures Country Park. To east are vast lakes, from gravel and sand extraction, started modestly in the 19th century, ramped up in the 1960s and 70s. The near, long resultant lake is White Swan Lake. By the late 1970s, these were exhausted and left stopped up to flood, so Wokingham Borough Council could take ownership and create the country park.

Shortly after Dinton Pastures is Sandford Mill, a corn mill in 1873 which was disused by the 1960s. In fields west of Hurst:
*the river is joined by the Emm Brook. 
*the river splits into two, the west channel being labelled &quot;Old River&quot; on most maps since 1894, both unmoved since at least 1873.

After the lakes the flows are crossed by the Great Western Main Line railway. Northwest is Charvil Country Park, amid the flows is Loddon Nature Reserve and northeast is Twyford, its Flour Mill at Silk Lane replaced by commercial blocks above which it received the Broadwater or Twyford Brook, the outlet of The Cut, until diverted east to Bray Lock around 1820. The A3032 crossing follows, then the A4. Half of St Patrick&#x27;s Stream, a backwater of the River Thames, joins; north is junction with the Thames, just downstream of Shiplake Lock, on the southern limit of Wargrave.

==Milling==
The river has powered more water mills than the many mentioned above. At Twyford, there have been mills since at least 1365, and a silk mill was built in 1810. Silk worms thrive on mulberry trees. Queen Elizabeth I encouraged planting of them in her reign.

The Wokingham area was known for its production of silk stockings, and the turn-of-the 19th century brothers, Thomas and George Billing from Macclesfield sought out a profitable business of processing. The spun silk was woven on looms set up in cottages, and for a while they were reasonably successful with labour costs kept down, employing children who should have been at Polehampton School. The law liberalised to allow silk to be imported more freely from France, and only mills equipped with up-to-date equipment could compete. Thomas died in 1824. The mill was sold to become a flour mill soon after. The wooden building was burnt down in a fire in 1891. A new mill was built, and in 1927 was bought by Berks, Bucks and Oxon Farmers Ltd, a farmers&#x27; co-operative, milling animal feed. The mill was powered by water wheels bolstered by diesel (and from the 1960s, electric) motors. A distribution warehouse was added in 1969, but a fire destroyed the mill in 1976, and construction of a new mill was completed in 1979. The new building was much larger than the old, and a section of Twyford Brook was culverted, to allow the buildings to extend onto land between the brook and the Loddon (ex-marsh). The owners became bankrupt in the 1990s, and in 2001 the site was redeveloped for housing. Much of the building has four storeys, as did the pre-1976 building with cosmetic features to hark back to the forerunners.

Sandford Mill was used for milling feed for animals until the 1950s, and was powered by two waterwheels. It is known to have existed during the English Civil War, as it was mentioned in reports. Following a period of disuse, it has been converted into a residence. The main structure of Sindlesham Mill dates from the late 1800s, but it may incorporate part of an earlier structure, as some of the timbers are much older than that. It used a turbine rather than a water wheel to generate its power, and was owned by the Reading-based Simmonds family, who were involved in banking and brewing. Later, it was acquired by Garfield Weston, and produced flour for the biscuit manufacturer Huntley &amp; Palmers until the 1960s. It is now part of a hotel.

Milling had been performed at Arborfield since at least 1500, as foundations dating to that time were discovered in 1953. The mill was originally a grist mill, used for grinding corn or flour, but George Dawson converted it to a paper mill. A Mr. Hodgson was the paper maker in 1787, and in 1794 the business was auctioned as a going concern. In 1826, the large water wheel powered a paper making machine. Three years later there was a fire at the mill, and another in 1861. Output from the mill included fine brown paper. Mrs Hargreaves, the owner of Arborfield Hall, is thought to have demolished part of the mill some time after 1861, but it was offered for sale again in 1919, and at the time included a water wheel and a turbine. Pumps and a dynamo supplied water and electricity to the hall, and powered the machinery on the farm. In the 1840s or 1850s, an engine house was built near the mill, which housed a steam engine manufactured in Reading by Barrett, Exall &amp; Andrews. Two steam engines later powered the paper mill. The mill was owned by Guthrie Allsebrook from the 1920s, who hoped to supply water to the local authority, because he also owned the water rights. The ground floor of the building still exists, and was in use by Thames Water in 2004.
Records show that milling was taking place near Sherfield on Loddon in 1274, when the miller was called John. There is also reference to a water mill in 1316, and a document recording holdings passed to the Manor in 1601 listed two water mills, a fulling mill and another mill. By 1819, there were two water wheels at the Longbridge mill, which powered four pairs of grinding wheels. By the end of the Second World War, the mill was producing animal feed, and continued to use water power until 1961. Commercial operation of the mill ceased in 1977, and it was damaged by fire in 1991. Restoration of the damaged building began soon afterwards, and was completed in 1997. Since then the mill has been operated on a monthly basis by the Hampshire Mills Group, and is used to grind flour on open days. The building dates from the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, and is a listed building.

The mill at Stanfordend, to the north of Stratfield Saye Park, has been disused since the 1930s. Power was generated by the use of three turbines, rather than a water wheel. It is owned by the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s estate, who had plans in 2000 to restore it to working condition.
Hartley Mill, on the Lyde just above its junction with the Loddon, is now a residence, but the water wheel has been retained, and can be seen from the dining room.
The Lower Mill at Old Basing is a four-storey building dating from the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and is grade II listed. 
Old Basing mill is another four-storey building, which still contained much of the original machinery in 2000, although it was not operational.

==Hydrology==
Whilst chalk underlies much of the drainage basin, it only appears at the bed near Wargrave and Basingstoke. For the rest of its course the chalk lies beneath the Reading Beds and London Clay. The terrace gravels and sand of the valley have been partly extracted, as stated above.

The basin has large, quite dense population centres in Basingstoke and eastern Reading, plus the Farnborough/Aldershot Built-up Area so the Loddon takes treated sewage effluent from nine main plants, Basingstoke&#x27;s (see above), seven of the Blackwater and one at Wargrave.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Loddon was as follows in 2019.
Water quality improved after 2009, when the ecological status of the middle two sections was poor, and the chemical status of the lower Loddon to the Thames was fail. From 2015–16 the upper section improved to moderate, but the lower section was worse, moving from moderate to poor. Reasons for the water quality being less than good include the discharge of sewage effluent, physical barriers to the movement of fish caused by modifications to the channel, and dominant, disease-carrier North American signal crayfish. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

==Flora and fauna==
===The Loddon lily===

Named for the river Loddon is the Loddon lily, &quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot;, a member, not of the lily family, but of the daffodil family Amaryllidaceae and known also as summer snowflake. A bulbous plant, which increases well on heavy clay soils, it is somewhat similar in appearance to a large snowdrop and thrives in wet meadows and willow thickets, being also prolific along the river banks and islands. Although less abundant than they used to be, Loddon lilies can still be found along the river Loddon, mainly in the vicinity of Sandford Mill.

===SSSI===
A stretch of the Loddon near Stanford End Mill, together with the adjacent hay meadows, which are periodically waterlogged, is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Loddon has been part of the SSSI since 1986. The meadows are cut for hay in July then grazed by cattle until the end of the year. This cycle has resulted in an increase in numbers of the snake&#x27;s head fritillary (&quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot;), another flowering bulb, which thrives in damp meadows when not regularly cut short by cutting. The river is included for its mainstay population of Loddon pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton nodosus&quot;).

===Fish===
The River Loddon has an identifiable array of fish, differing from the mainstream Thames locally including shoals of bream, chub, roach, rudd and large barbel. The record for the largest barbel caught on the river stands at , caught in 2008. Other records include a pike caught in 1995 and same-weight carp caught in 2002.

To facilitate migrating fish, £485,000 was spent creating a bypass around weirs at Arborfield in 2010 – a project of the Environment Agency, Thames Water, the University of Reading, Farley Estate and Arborfield Angling Society, meeting the public spending commitment directed by the Water Framework Directive. This provided:
*new habitats, including suitable for fish to spawn, expected to be of benefit to salmon, sea trout, eels and barbel.
*repairs to four of the five weirs at Arborfield, to lower water on the section above, to reduce the flood profile.

Cain Bio-Engineering carried out the construction work and have claimed that the project constitutes a benchmark for such schemes.

In 2018, the first phase of a scheme to improve the river near Sandford Mill for fish was completed. Over the years, dredging of the river led to water flowing slowly through the enlarged channel, particularly in summer so the bed silted. Thames Water, Twyford and District Fishing Club, the Angling Trust, the Environment Agency and Wokingham Council thus felled trees to improve light, used the wood as flow deflectors as meanders, 80 tonnes of gravel were added and the faster flow prevent silting. Fast-flowing shallow riffles make spawning grounds for dace, chub and barbel. Means to prevent young fish from being washed downstream, in flood, exists in the dug-out Redlands backwater.

==Navigation==
The lower Loddon was used for at least recreational navigation. On many reaches of the river, boat houses are marked on old maps, including two on the Arborfield estate, one of which still exists, one near Mill Lane at Sindlesham, and another at Woodley, near to Colmansmoor Lane. Other evidence includes postcards in the collection at Reading Local Studies Library, which show a punt at Twyford and rowing boats at Sindlesham Mill and Arborfield Hall. Old postcards also show that &quot;The George&quot; public house at Winnersh used to have rowing boats on the river available for hire. There was a boathouse on the opposite bank to the public house, one of eleven on the river around the 1900s.

Lady Constance Russell, writing in 1901 recorded that Sir Henry Russell, who owned Swallowfield Park and died in 1852, spent his latter years &quot;improving&quot; that, which included filling in the canal which &quot;ran from the Lock Pool near the church to the Bow Bridge&quot;. The canal is clearly shown on a map produced in 1790 by Thomas Pride, and on an Enclosure Map for Swallowfield, produced in 1817 and held at the Berkshire Record Office. Further evidence for the use of the river was the death of John Alfred Dymott in 1917, who drowned after falling out of a punt, moving materials. He often performed such duties, here assisting the estate carpenter to erect fencing near the river and remove timber from it.

==Points of interest==







==Cultural influence==
Characterised generally as slow, swampy and tree-girt, the Loddon has inspired more than one work in verse.

In his lengthy and politically charged poem &quot;Windsor Forest&quot; Alexander Pope invents a nymph of the Loddon named Lodona, giving her a form of the name of the river Ládōn in Arcadia where the nymph Syrinx was transformed into a reed, as recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; - from which work he also draws the familiar plot device of the chaste female delivered from the unwelcome attentions of a lustful god by her prayed-for transformation into a plant or watercourse. He chose a variant of the name of this mythological river for its obvious similarity to that of the Loddon, which ran for part of its course through Windsor Forest (the much-reduced remnant of which is now known as Windsor Great Park).
He makes a further connection between the then royal protectress of Windsor, Queen Anne, and the goddess Diana, protectress of the Arcadian woods and the nymphs who dwelt in them. The personal, yet classically inspired mythology that Pope creates for his poem fables that Diana and her attendant nymphs once roamed the &#x27;Windsor shade&#x27;:

Here, as old Bards have sung, Diana stray&#x27;d
Bath&#x27;d in the Springs, or sought the cooling Shade;
Here arm&#x27;d with Silver Bows, in early Dawn,
Her buskin&#x27;d Virgins trac&#x27;d the Dewy Lawn.
Above the rest a rural nymph was fam&#x27;d,
Thy Offspring, Thames! the fair Lodona nam&#x27;d...

Pan saw and lov&#x27;d, and furious with Desire
Pursu&#x27;d her Flight; her Flight increas&#x27;d his Fire...

Let me, O let me, to the Shades repair,
&quot;My native Shades — there weep, and murmur there.
She said, and melting as in Tears she lay,
In a soft, silver Stream dissolv&#x27;d away.
The silver Stream her Virgin Coldness keeps,
For ever murmurs, and for ever weeps;
Still bears the Name the hapless Virgin bore,
And bathes the Forest where she rang&#x27;d before...
The watry Landskip of the pendant Woods,
And absent Trees that tremble in the Floods...

The Loddon slow, with verdant alders crown&#x27;d...

Extracts from &quot;Windsor Forest&quot;by Alexander Pope

The amiable and erudite Thomas Warton, negligent clergyman but diligent poet, spent much of his childhood beside the Loddon, near its sources in Basingstoke, for the infant Loddon then flowed through the grounds of the Parsonage House that belonged the living of the Vicar of Basingstoke, an incumbency filled by his father, Thomas Warton the elder from 1723 until his death in 1745. The 300-line poem &quot;The Pleasures of Melancholy&quot;, written by the precocious younger Warton at the age of just seventeen, contains the following lines concerning a poet lost in reverie by a shady, wooded stream at eventide that convey the strong impression of inspiration by the slow and drowsy Loddon:
...in embowering woods
By darksome brook to muse, and there forget
The solemn dulness of the tedious world,
While Fancy grasps the visionary fair:
And now no more th&#x27; abstracted ear attends
The water&#x27;s murmuring lapse, th&#x27; entranced eye
Pierces no longer through th&#x27; extended rows
Of thick-ranged trees; till haply from the depth
The woodman&#x27;s stroke, or distant tinkling team
Or heifers rustling through the brake, alarms
Th&#x27; illuded sense, and mars the golden dream. 

To the River Lodon (1777)
Ah! what a weary race my feet have run
Since first I trod thy banks with alders crowned,
And thought my way was all thro&#x27; fairy ground,
Beneath thy azure sky and golden sun;
Where first my muse to lisp her notes begun!
While pensive Memory traces back the round, 
Which fills the varied interval between;
Much pleasure, more of sorrow, marks the scene. 
Sweet native stream! those skies and suns so pure
No more return, to cheer my evening road! 
Yet still one joy remains, that, not obscure, 
Nor useless, all my vacant days have flowed,
From youth&#x27;s gay dawn to manhood&#x27;s prime mature;
Nor with the muse&#x27;s laurel unbestowed.
the ninth sonnet of Thomas Warton
(8th Poet laureate, 20 April 1785 – 21 May 1790)

<text>Auburn was a brand name of American automobiles produced from 1900 to 1937, most known for the Auburn Speedster models it produced, which were fast, good-looking and expensive. However, after the 1929 Wall Street Crash, and the economic downturn that ensued, Auburn&#x27;s expensive automobiles, along with its also very expensive sister marques Duesenberg and Cord, saw inevitable sales downturns, and all vehicle business halted in 1937.

After a 1940 bankruptcy reorganization, the former Auburn Automobile Co. merged with the Central Manufacturing Company into Auburn Central Manufacturing (ACM) Corporation, which received large amounts of World War II production work, so much so, that in 1943, they rebranded ACM as &quot;American&quot; Central Manufacturing. One of their most notable WW II contributions involved manufacturing the bodies of at least three quarters, or about half a million, of the World War II Willys and Ford 1/4ton jeeps.

==Corporate history==
The Auburn Automobile Company grew out of the Eckhart Carriage Company, founded in Auburn, Indiana, in 1874 by Charles Eckhart (1841–1915). Eckhart&#x27;s sons, Frank and Morris, experimented making automobiles before entering the business in earnest, absorbing two other local carmakers and moving into a larger plant in 1909. The enterprise was modestly successful until materials shortages during World War I forced the plant to close.

In 1919, the Eckhart brothers sold the company to a group of Chicago investors headed by Ralph Austin Bard, who later served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and as Undersecretary of the Navy for President Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman. The new owners revived the business, but it proved unprofitable. In 1924 they approached Errett Lobban Cord (1894–1974), a highly successful automobile salesman, with an offer to run the company. Cord countered with an offer to take over completely in what amounted to a leveraged buyout, which the Chicago group accepted. Cord aggressively marketed the company&#x27;s unsold inventory and completed his buyout before the end of 1925.

But after the 1929 stock market crash, despite advanced engineering and aggressive styling, Auburn&#x27;s upscale vehicles were too expensive for the Depression-era market, and around 1935, Auburn started to produce a line of kitchen cabinets and sinks, to keep the company afloat.
Cord&#x27;s illegal stock manipulations would force him to give up control of his automobile holding company, which included the even more expensive Cord, and Rolls-Royce-priced high-performance Duesenberg brands, as well as Central Manufacturing Co., an 1896 coach-building company that built metal bodies for a number of different car companies, including Auburn. Under injunction from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to refrain from further violations, Cord sold his shares in his automobile holding company. In 1937, automotive production of all three marques ended.

Nevertheless, after a 1940 bankruptcy reorganization, the former Auburn Automobile and Central Manufacturing Companies merged into Auburn Central Manufacturing / (ACM) Corporation.

In March 1941, Auburn Central Manufacturing (ACM) landed an important contract with Willys-Overland, initially for 1,600 Willys MA jeep bodies. The first bodies were shipped in April 1941, but more, very large, jeep body manufacturing contracts were gained from both Willys-Overland and Ford Motor Company during World War II. In addition to jeep bodies, ACM also made trailer bodies and aircraft components.

In March 1942, ACM changed its name from Auburn Central to American Central Manufacturing.

ACM then went on receiving orders from Willys-Overland for &quot;all body-tubs&quot; of their roughly 360,000 World War II 1/4ton, Willys MB jeeps, through 1945; plus roughly midway of their 280,000 or so 1/4ton GPW jeep production, Ford &quot;also&quot; ordered the remainder of their jeep body tubs from ACM as well !&lt;br&gt;
By mid 1943, during peak wartime production, and having built their 150,000th jeep body, the Connersville, Indiana company, and ACM&#x27;s large buildings complex, together with many more automotive industries there had formed a veritable industrial park, that earned the town the nickname &quot;Little Detroit&quot;. Eventually, Jeep body production for Willys continued through 1948.

Post-war, in 1945, kitchen sinks, appliances, and cabinets were chosen as having the largest market potential for ACM&#x27;s manufacturing capabilities. This indeed became ACM&#x27;s core product after the war.

==Models==
The 1904 Auburn was a touring car model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat two or four passengers and sold for US$1,000, ($ in dollars ). The flat-mounted single-cylinder engine, situated at the center of the car, produced 10 hp (7.5 kW). A two-speed planetary transmission was fitted. The angle-steel-framed car weighed and used half-elliptic springs.

In 1926, Errett Cord, now the owner of Auburn, partnered with Duesenberg Corporation, famous for its racing cars, and used it as the launching platform for a line of high-priced luxury vehicles, the Duesenberg Model J. He also put his own name on one of the first front-wheel-drive cars, Cord, known as the Cord L-29.

The company employed imaginative designers such as Alan Leamy, chief designer of the 1933 Auburn Speedster, and Gordon Buehrig, designer of the 810/812 Cords. Buehrig joined the company in Indianapolis in 1926 with Duesenberg Motors, and is credited with styling roughly half of the Model Js produced. Duesenberg built the chassis while the bodies were built either to Duesenberg&#x27;s own specifications, or to the special order of the buyer, by selected independent body companies.

In 1934, Buehrig was transferred to Auburn Auto where he designed the 1935 Auburn 851 Speedster. The Speedster was styled or modified to use leftover speedster bodies. Buehrig and a design team were then assigned to E.L. Cord&#x27;s so-called &quot;Baby Duesenberg&quot; to build a smaller, more affordable car. Designed by Buehrig in 1933, it became the acclaimed 1936/37 Cord 810/ 812 Cords, a hit at the November 1935 annual New York Automobile Show—acclaimed for advanced engineering as well as revolutionary styling. His design work completed, he left the company in 1937. [source, daughter Barbara Buehrig Orlando plus the ACDA Museum] and modified the four-door, Cord built cars such as the Duesenberg Model J (1928–37), the Auburn Speedster (1935–37), and the Cord 810/812 (1936–37) that became famous for their advanced engineering as well as their striking appearance. The &quot;Auburn Boattail Speedster&quot; was powered by a 4.6L straight eight that, with the popular supercharger option (150 hp), could top making it a popular model in the Hollywood market.

The Depression, coupled with Cord&#x27;s stock manipulations, spelled the end of the company and production ceased in 1937. The company&#x27;s art deco headquarters in Auburn now houses the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum and became a National Historic Landmark in 2005. The Auburn Automobile Company also had a manufacturing plant in Connersville, Indiana, formerly owned by the Lexington Motor Company.

<text>The Barbados Slave Code of 1661, officially titled as An Act for the better ordering and governing of Negroes, was a law passed by the Parliament of Barbados to provide a legal basis for slavery in the English colony of Barbados. It is the first comprehensive Slave Act, and the code&#x27;s preamble, which stated that the law&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;protect them [slaves] as we do men&#x27;s other goods and Chattels&quot;, established that black slaves would be treated as chattel property in the island&#x27;s court.

==Details==
The slave code described black people as &#x27;an heathenish, brutish and an uncertaine, dangerous kind of people&#x27;. 

The Barbados slave code ostensibly sought to protect slaves from cruel masters (&quot;the Negroes and other Slaves be well provided for, and guarded from the Cruelties and Insolences of themselves or other ill-tempered People or Owners&quot;) and masters (and &quot;any Christian&quot;) from unruly slaves; in practice, it provided extensive protections for masters, but not for slaves. The law required masters to provide each slave with one set of clothing per year, but it set no standards for slaves&#x27; diet, housing, or working conditions. It denied slaves, as chattels, even basic human rights guaranteed under common law, such as the right to life. It allowed the slaves&#x27; owners to do entirely as they wished to their slaves for anything considered a misdeed, including mutilating them and burning them alive, without fear of reprisal. For example, if a Black person was found guilty of inflicting violence against a white person, the code stipulated that they should be &quot;severely whipped&quot;, have &quot;his or her nose slit and shall be burnt in the face&quot;, while the next offence shall be &quot;punished by death&quot;. However, &quot;if any Man shall of wantonness, or only of Bloody Mindedness, or Cruel Intention, willfully kill a Negro or other Slave of his own, he shall pay into the Publick Treasury ... if he shall so kill another Man&#x27;s, He shall pay to the Owner of the Negro, double the Value, and into the Publick Treasury ... And he shall further by the next Justice of the Peace, be bound to the good Behaviour&quot;.

The Barbados Assembly reenacted the slave code, with minor modifications, in 1676 titled as &quot;A Supplemental Act to a Former Act for the Better Ordering and Governing of Negroes&quot;, 1682, and 1688 titled as &quot;An Act for the Governing of Negroes&quot;. The slave codes (not digitised) are available at The National Archives. The laws of colonial Barbados to 1699, including those comprising the Slave Code, were collected in a book available online, &quot;The laws of Barbados collected in one volume by William Rawlin, of the Middle-Temple&quot;. In particular No. 329 details the 1688 Act (the entry for the original 1661 Act, No. 57, reads only &quot;Repealed by Act 330&quot;—an error, actually 329). 

&quot;No person of the Hebrew Nation residing in any Sea-Port Town of this Island, shall keep or employ any Negro or other Slave ... for any Use or Service whatsoever.&quot; 

In 2021 the British Library digitised and made public 19th-century newspapers of Barbados (the originals remaining on the island) hoping that the public would help to find information about individual slaves on the island; names and descriptions were only made known for slaves who revolted or escaped, and are lost to history unless recorded in newspapers.

==Wider influence==
Throughout British North America, slavery evolved in practice before it was codified into law. The Barbados slave code of 1661 marked the beginning of the legal codification of slavery. According to historian Russell Menard, &quot;Since Barbados was the first English colony to write a comprehensive slave code, its code was especially influential.&quot;

The Barbados Slave Code served as the basis for the slave codes adopted in several other British American colonies, including Colony of Jamaica],] Carolina (1696), Georgia, and [[Antigua].] In other colonies where the codes are not an exact copy, such as [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], the influence of the Barbados Slave Code can be traced throughout various provisions.

The legal basis for slavery was established in [[Mexico]] in 1636. These statutes created the status of [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] slave for those of African descent, i.e. they were slaves for life and the status of slave was inherited. Slave status passed to children through the mother in these statutes. Virginia&#x27;s 1662 statute reads, &quot;All children borne in this country shall be held bond or free only according to the condition of the mother.&quot;

==Excerpt==
The Barbados slave code, named An Act for Better Ordering and Governing of Negroes, (1661) was promoted on the island, ostensibly, to standardize procedures for managing the island&#x27;s increasing slave population, which had tripled since 1640. 
&quot;If any Negro or slave whatsoever shall offer any violence to any Christian by striking or any other form of violence, such Negro or slave shall for his or her first offence be severely whipped by the Constable.
For his second offence of that nature he shall be severely whipped, his nose slit, and be burned in some part of his face with a hot iron. [...] And being brutish slaves, [they] deserve not, for the baseness of their condition, to be tried by the legal trial of twelve men of their peers, as the subjects of England are.
And it is further enacted and ordained that if any Negro or other slave under punishment by his master unfortunately shall suffer in life or member, which seldom happens, no person whatsoever shall be liable to any fine therefore.&quot;

<text>Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues (6 October 1795 – 17 December 1851), more commonly known as Olinde Rodrigues, was a French banker, mathematician, and social reformer. In mathematics Rodrigues is remembered for Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula for vectors, the Rodrigues formula for the Legendre polynomials, and the Euler–Rodrigues parameters.

==Biography==
Rodrigues was born into a well-to-do Sephardi Jewish family in Bordeaux. His family was of Portuguese-Jewish descent. He was awarded a doctorate in mathematics on 28 June 1815 by the University of Paris. His dissertation contains the result now called Rodrigues&#x27; formula.

After graduation, Rodrigues became a banker. A close associate of the Comte de Saint-Simon, Rodrigues continued, after Saint-Simon&#x27;s death in 1825, to champion the older man&#x27;s socialist ideals, a school of thought that came to be known as Saint-Simonianism. During this period, Rodrigues published writings on politics, social reform, and banking.

Rodrigues&#x27; 1840 paper developed new results on transformation groups. It uses three numbers to parameterize the entries of a rotation matrix using only rational functions. When converted to four parameters, this representation is equivalent to a unit-norm quaternion, and describes the axis and angle of a rotation. In addition, he applied spherical trigonometry to relate changes in rotation axis and angle due to the combined effect of two rotations. This formula is a precursor to the quaternion product of William Rowan Hamilton. In 1846, Arthur Cayley acknowledged Euler&#x27;s and Rodrigues&#x27; priority describing orthogonal transformations.

Rodrigues is credited as originating the idea of the artist as an avant-garde.

<doc id="1003284" wikidata="Q112102" url="?curid=1003284" title="Princess Sophie of Hohenberg">
<text>Princess Sophie of Hohenberg (&quot;Sophie Marie Franziska Antonia Ignatia Alberta von Hohenberg&quot;; – ) was the only daughter of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, both of whom were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. This assassination triggered the First World War, thus Sophie and her two brothers are sometimes described as the first orphans of the First World War.

==Early life==

Princess Sophie was born on 24 July 1901 at Konopiště chateau, in Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic), fifty kilometres south-east of Prague. This chateau, situated in Bohemia, was the favourite home of the Archduke and his wife. On 29 September 1902, the couple&#x27;s first son, Maximilian, was born. A second son, Ernst, followed on 17 May 1904. In 1908, the Archduke&#x27;s wife became pregnant again, but the fourth child, a boy, was stillborn on 7 November 1908.

Since the Archduke had sworn an oath that any children he had with his morganatic wife could never succeed to the throne, he envisaged a future for them that would be normal and tranquil. He wanted his sons to lead the uncomplicated life of a country squire, while he intended that his daughter, Sophie, would be happy at the side of a socially-suitable partner whom she loved. He hoped that his children would grow up to be private individuals who could enjoy life without material worries, while leading lives of anonymity. Sophie later said that she and her brothers were brought up to know they were nothing special. She stated that her father had been firm with his children, but never harsh or unjust.

==After assassination==

After the assassination of her parents, Sophie and her two surviving brothers, Maximilian and Ernst, were taken in by their mother&#x27;s brother-in-law and their father&#x27;s close friend and shooting partner, Prince Jaroslav von Thun und Hohenstein.

In late 1918, their properties in Czechoslovakia, including Konopiště and Chlumec nad Cidlinou, were confiscated by the Czechoslovak government. The children moved to Vienna and Schloß Artstetten.

==Marriage and issue==

On 8 September 1920, Sophie married Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck (1 November 1893 in Prague – 29 December 1973 in Graz), son of Count Erwein Felix von Nostitz-Rieneck and Countess Amalia Podstatzky-Lichtenstein, in Tetschen. They had four children:
*Count Erwein von Nostitz-Rieneck (29 June 1921 in Heinrichsgrün – 11 September 1949 in Vysokaye), died in a Soviet POW camp.
*Count Franz von Nostitz-Rieneck (2 February 1923 in Vienna – 23 February 1945 in Berent), killed on the Eastern Front.
*Count Aloys von Nostitz-Rieneck (12 August 1925 in Vienna – 22 April 2003 in Salzburg) married Countess Theresia von Waldburg zu Zeil und Trauchburg (born 8 August 1931 in Leutkirch im Allgäu), daughter of Erich, Prince of Waldburg-Zeil and Trauchburg, and Princess Monika of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. They have four children.
*Countess Sophie von Nostitz-Rieneck (4 June 1929 in Vienna - 19 April 2024 in Thannhausen), married Baron Ernst von Gudenus (26 March 1916 in Madrid – 7 December 1972 in Weiz), son of Baron Erwein von Gudenus and Baroness Sidonia von Morsey genannt Picard. They have four children.

==Later life==
In 1938, following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (the union of Austria and Germany under Adolf Hitler), her brothers Maximilian and Ernst were arrested by the Gestapo as a result of making anti-Nazi statements and deported to Dachau concentration camp. Their properties in Austria were confiscated by Nazi authorities. They both survived their imprisonment in Dachau.

Sophie&#x27;s husband died in 1973, after which she led a quiet life in Austria, accompanied at times by her grandchildren. In 1981, she visited Konopiště for the first time in sixty years. During this visit, she talked of how happy her family life had been there.

Sophie lived to be 89 years old, dying in October 1990 at Thannhausen, Austria. She was laid to rest beside the body of her husband in the family crypt of her son-in-law, Baron Ernst Gudenus, at nearby Weizberg. She had outlived both of her younger siblings by many years.

==Letter to Nedeljko Čabrinović==
During the trial of the men accused of murdering Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the only defendant to express remorse was Nedeljko Čabrinović, who expressed his regrets for what he had done and apologized to the children of the victims. Princess Sophie and her brothers were told about Čabrinović&#x27;s apology and wrote a letter to him. In the letter, they said they had heard about his apology and stated that his conscience could be at peace because they forgave him for his role in the murder of their parents. Sophie and Max signed the letter, but Ernst refused. The letter was delivered personally to Čabrinović in his cell at Theresienstadt, in Bohemia, by the Jesuit Father Anton Puntigam, who had given the last rites to Franz Ferdinand and his wife. On 23 January 1916, Princess Sophie and her brothers were informed that Čabrinović had died.

==Fictional appearances==
A fictional version of Princess Sophie, played by Danish actress Amalie Ihle Alstrup, appeared in &quot;Vienna, November 1908&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; later re-edited to form half of &quot;The Perils of Cupid&quot;. Young Indy falls in love with the princess and shares his first kiss with her, but is forbidden from seeing her further. Several times during the series, he is shown wearing a locket that contains her picture, which she gave to him.

<text>Steven Peter Russell Rose (born 4 July 1938) is an English neuroscientist, author, and social commentator. He is an emeritus professor of biology and neurobiology at the Open University and Gresham College, London.

==Early life==
Born in London, United Kingdom, he was brought up as an Orthodox Jew. Rose says that he decided to become an atheist when he was eight years old. He went to a direct grant school in northwest London which operated a &quot;numerus clausus&quot; restricting the numbers of Jewish students. He studied biochemistry at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and neurochemistry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King&#x27;s College London.

==Academic career==
Following a Fellowship at New College, Oxford, and a Medical Research Council research post, he was appointed to the professorship of biology at the newly instituted Open University in 1969. At the time he was Britain&#x27;s youngest full professor and chair of the department. At the Open University he established the Brain Research Group, within which he and his colleagues investigated the biological processes involved in memory formation and treatments for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on which he has published some 300 research papers and reviews. He has written several popular science books and regularly writes for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. From 1999 to 2002, he gave public lectures as a Professor of Physick (Genetics and Society) with his wife, the feminist sociologist Hilary Rose at Gresham College, London. His work has won him numerous medals and prizes including the Biochemical Society medal for communication in science and the prestigious Edinburgh Medal in 2004. His book &quot;The Making of Memory&quot; won the Rhone-Poulenc Science Book Prize in 1993.
In 2012 the British Neuroscience Association gave him a lifetime award for &quot;Outstanding contributions to neuroscience.&quot;

Together with Hilary Rose he was a founder member of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in the 1960s, and more recently they have been instrumental in calling for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions for as long as Israel continues its occupation of the Palestinian Territories, on the grounds of Israeli academics&#x27; close relationship with the IDF. An open letter initiated by Steven and Hilary Rose, and also signed by 123 other academics was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 6 April 2002. In 2004 Hilary Rose and he were the founding members of the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine.

Rose was for several years a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s ethics debating series &quot;The Moral Maze&quot;. He is a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. He was part of the Royal Society&#x27;s working group producing their Brain Waves modules on the state of neuroscience and its social framing, and was a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on &quot;Novel Neurotechnologies&quot;. His recent books with Hilary Rose include &quot;Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology&quot;, in 2012, &quot;Genes, Cells and Brains: the Promethean promises of the new biology&quot; (Verso), described by &quot;Guardian&quot; reviewer Steven Poole as &#x27;fascinating, lucid and angry&#x27; with a &#x27;lethally impressive hit ratio&#x27; and most recently &quot;Can Neuroscience Change Our Minds?&quot; (Polity, 2016). His audio-autobiography forms part of the British Library&#x27;s National Life Stories Collection of distinguished scientists. The sociologist Nikolas Rose is his younger brother. Hilary and he have two sons. He remains an atheist.

== Critique of genetic determinism ==
With Richard Lewontin and Leon Kamin, Rose championed the &quot;radical science movement&quot;. The three criticized sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and adaptationism, most prominently in the book &quot;Not in Our Genes&quot; (1984), laying out their opposition to (E. O. Wilson, 1975), &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (Richard Dawkins, 1976), and other works promoting an evolutionary explanation for human social behaviour. &quot;Not in Our Genes&quot; described Dawkins as &quot;the most reductionist of sociobiologists&quot;. In retort, Dawkins wrote that the book practices a straw man fallacy by distorting arguments &quot;in terms&quot; of genetics to &quot;an idiotic travesty (that the properties of a complex whole are simply the &quot;sum&quot; of those same properties in the parts)&quot;, and accused the authors of giving &quot;ideology priority over truth&quot;. Rose replied in the second edition of his book &quot;Lifelines&quot;. Rose wrote further works in this area: in 2000 he jointly edited with the sociologist Hilary Rose, a critique of evolutionary psychology entitled &quot;Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology&quot;. In 2006 he wrote a paper dismissing classical heritability estimates as useful scientific measures in respect of human populations especially in the context of IQ.

Rose wrote the introduction of &quot;The Richness of Life&quot; (2007) by the prominent American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science, Stephen Jay Gould.

<doc id="1003299" wikidata="Q580834" url="?curid=1003299" title="Antiope (teletext)">
<text>Antiope was a French teletext standard in the 1980s. It also formed the basis for the display standard used in the French videotex service Minitel. The term allegedly stood for Acquisition Numérique et Télévisualisation d’Images Organisées en Pages d’Écriture, which could be loosely translated as &quot;Digital Acquisition and Remote Visualization of Images Organized into Written Pages&quot;.
== History ==
Work on Antiope started in 1972 at CCETT, the newly merged French national research centre for television and telecommunications in Rennes, with first field trials in 1975. The system was officially launched in 1976 at Vidcom in Cannes, and simultaneously at the СПОРТ 76 exposition in Moscow. It was adopted into the international standard CCIR 653 (now ITU-R BT.653) of 1986 as CCIR Teletext System A.

Commercial broadcasting of Antiope began on Antenne 2 in 1979. To publicise the service, pages were even transmitted &quot;en clair&quot; instead of the test card (compare the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot;). TF1 and FR3 both also began to broadcast Antiope content from the early 1980s. Antiope decoding was initially by set-top boxes connected to the television by a SCART cable. Grundig France began to sell TVs with integrated decoders from 1983, followed by other manufacturers.

Antenne 2 began using the system to broadcast teletext subtitles for the hard-of-hearing in 1983, with three programmes subtitled by the end of the year. The number rose to 15 programmes across the three channels in 1984, and 30 in 1985.

Attempts had been made to sell the system internationally, including test broadcasts in the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1980, CBS had lobbied U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) directly to make Antiope the teletext standard for the United States. However, by 1986, all these efforts had failed. Across Europe 9 million sets had been sold equipped to receive teletext based on the UK standard; whereas in France, the only country using Antiope, sales had only reached 100,000. 

Manufacture of Antiope-equipped TV sets ceased in 1987, and in 1989 broadcasts began in the rival European standard World System Teletext. For a while the two services were broadcast in parallel, but Antiope broadcasts finally ceased in the early 1990s.

Although the transport protocols were different, much of the on-screen functionality of Antiope was recreated in the extended so-called &quot;Hi-Text&quot; Level 2.5 version of the European standard, first broadcast in 1994 by the bilingual French-German channel ARTE.

The Antiope-derived Minitel remained in use until 2012.

== Technology ==
Antiope was based on a 40 × 25 character grid using ISO 646 and ISO 2022, with support for accented letters. A fundamental difference in technical philosophy between Antiope and the Ceefax teletext system developed by the BBC stemmed from the fact that Antiope was developed by telecommunications engineers, while Ceefax was developed by television engineers. The television engineers created a system which filled the screen with data at a fixed, predictable rate; in contrast Antiope was constructed like a packet-switching system, with variable length packets of data, as might be used on a telephone network.

In both cases, the teletext data was transmitted during the vertical blanking interval, the portion of time allocated for the electron beam to return from the bottom of the screen back up to the top between each frame of the image (which corresponds to a transmission time of 25 lines in each field of PAL or SECAM), and each line used conveyed a fixed number of bytes each cycle: 40 bytes for European systems, 32 in the United States. In the BBC Ceefax system each group of 40 bytes corresponded directly to one row of 40 characters, each byte representing both the character and its place in the row – a video synchronous system.

In contrast, in the case of Antiope the delivery packet was independent of the screen presentation. One 40-byte packet might contain several rows; another might contain only part of a row, if it contained several colour changes or accented characters (coded with two or three bytes). In return, colour changes, or switches to graphical mode (called &quot;mosaic&quot;), which each had to take up one character space in the row on a Ceefax page, could be made freely in Antiope, allowing the construction of more elaborate pages.

Ceefax pages could be displayed using fairly simple hardware, using a character generator and a simple latch to keep track of the attributes in force at a particular character position as the page is scanned. Antiope was only a little more complicated, the relevant attributes for each character position (about 13 bits, or a few more if further additional fonts were in use) being stored in a separate memory page in the decoder, distinct from the memory page used for the characters.

This flexibility of Antiope provided a foundation on which multilingual and multialphabet systems were developed, and also systems using dynamically redefinable character sets (DRCS), especially in variants delivered over the telephone (videotex).

<doc id="1003313" wikidata="Q388295" url="?curid=1003313" title="Battle of the Coral Sea order of battle">
<text>The [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], a major engagement of the Pacific Theatre of World War II, was fought 4–8 May 1942 in the waters east of New Guinea and south of the Bismarck Islands between elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval and air forces from the United States (U.S.) and Australia.

To extend their empire in the Pacific to the conquest of Australia, the Japanese first had to capture the naval and air center of Port Moresby on the southeast coast of New Guinea. In order to extend the reach of their air searches for Allied naval forces, they resolved to simultaneously establish a seaplane base at Tulagi in the lower Solomon Islands. The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan, known as [[Operation Mo]], through signals intelligence and sent two United States Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-American cruiser force to oppose the Japanese offensive.

The result was a strategic defeat for the Japanese, since their principal goal of landing troops at Port Moresby was thwarted, but a tactical defeat for the Allies, who suffered more significant ship losses.

Because the Japanese assumed the tactical initiative, their forces are listed first.

<text>La Première () is a group of French radio and television stations operated by the state-owned France Télévisions group. The stations operate in France&#x27;s overseas departments and territories, and carry around the world.

==History==

The service was first established in 1954 as the Radiodiffusion de la France Outre-Mer (RFOM). It was renamed a year later as the Société de radiodiffusion de la France d&#x27;outre-mer (SORAFOM).

This was replaced in 1964, following the creation of the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française, by the Office de coopération radiophonique (OCORA).

In August 1974, OCORA became a part of the reformulated FR3: a network of regional television stations in mainland France. FR3&#x27;s overseas operations were known as FR3 DOM-TOM and, unlike the arrangement in metropolitan France, were in charge of both television and radio.

In December 1982, France&#x27;s overseas broadcasting operations were removed from FR3 and invested in the current organization, the Société de Radiodiffusion et de télévision Française pour l&#x27;Outre-mer (RFO).

In July 2004, Réseau France Outre-mer (RFO) was reunited with the French mainland&#x27;s public broadcasters when it was merged into the France Télévisions network.

On 30 November 2010, Réseau France Outre-mer was renamed Réseau Outre-Mer 1ère. In 2018, the name was changed to La Première, prefixed with the region name, to resolve a trademark concern from Groupe M6 over possible confusion with its channel Paris Première.

==Network services==
La Première consists of nine radio and television services serving eleven regions, departments or communities of Overseas France. The channels carry programmes that reflect the needs of the regions, including news bulletins and programmes reflective of the region&#x27;s culture and history. These include regional language programming where applicable.

The network also operates Radio Outre-mer La Première as a national internet radio station, which carries a mix of music and programmes from all of the La Première stations. France Télévisions previously operated an equivalent national television channel, France Ô, but it was closed in 2020 due to declining viewership, and replaced by a digital platform.

La Première radio is available only in overseas territories/departments and on the Internet via the website la1ere.fr. The content changes depending on what radio station you&#x27;re listening to online or depending on where you live in the overseas territories/departments just like France 3 does with the regional news bulletins such as &quot;12/13&quot;, &quot;Soir 3&quot; or other regional shows. It also offers free streaming online for radio and TV. The television broadcast on the website is only for those who live in the overseas territories/departments.

The territory of French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) does not have a dedicated station as the population is transient and non-indigenous. Broadcasts, stories and breaking news concerning TAAF would be handled by Réunion La Première as they arise as oversight of TAAF is headquartered in the Réunionnaise commune of Saint Pierre. The other territory without a station, Clipperton Island, also has no permanent population and is actually private property of the French government.

<text>Choudhry Rahmat Ali (; 16 November 1897 – 3 February 1951) was a Pakistani nationalist activist who was one of the earliest proponents of the creation of the state of Pakistan. He is credited with creating the name &quot;Pakistan&quot; for a separate Muslim homeland in British India and is generally known as the originator of the Pakistan Movement.

Born in Balachaur, Punjab, Rahmat Ali got his education in Lahore. His seminal contribution was when he was a law student at the University of Cambridge in 1933, in the form of a pamphlet &quot;&quot;, also known as the &quot;Pakistan Declaration&quot;.
The pamphlet was addressed to the British and Indian delegates to the Third Round Table Conference in London. The ideas did not find favour with the delegates or any of the politicians for close to a decade. They were dismissed as students&#x27; ideas particularly Muhammad Ali Jinnah but, by 1940, the Muslim politicians in the subcontinent came around to accept them, leading to the Lahore Resolution of the All-India Muslim League, which was immediately dubbed the &quot;Pakistan Resolution&quot; in the press. 

After the creation of Pakistan, Ali returned from England in April 1948, planning to stay in the country, but his belongings were confiscated and he was expelled by the prime minister Liaqat Ali Khan. In October 1948, Ali left empty-handed. He died on 3 February 1951 in Cambridge &quot;destitute, forlorn and lonely&quot;. The funeral expenses of insolvent Ali were covered by Emmanuel College, Cambridge on the instructions of its Master. Ali was buried on 20 February 1951 at Cambridge City Cemetery.

== Education and career ==

Rahmat Ali was born on 16 November 1897 into a Punjabi Muslim family. According to the historian K. K. Aziz, who knew Ali personally, he was from the Gorsi clan of Gujjar tribe. He grew up in the town of Balachaur in the Hoshiarpur District of Punjab in British India. After graduating from Islamia College Lahore in 1918, he taught at Aitchison College Lahore and after this, he served as the Chief Advisor to Sir Nawab Murad Buksh Khan Mazari for six years. During this period, he also took on the role of teacher to Sir Nawab Murad Buksh Khan Mazari&quot;s children, including Mir Balakh Sher Mazari who would later become the Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, and Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari, who was the Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan) and the head of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.,before joining Punjab University to study law. In 1930, he decided to move to England to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge which he joined in 1931. Subsequently, he obtained a BA degree in 1933 and MA in 1940 from the University of Cambridge. In 1933, he published a pamphlet, &quot;&quot;, coining the word &quot;Pakistan&quot; for the first time. In 1943, he was called to the Bar, from Middle Temple, London.

In 1946, he founded the Pakistan National Movement in England. Until 1947, he continued publishing various booklets about his vision for South Asia. The final Partition of India disillusioned him due to the mass killings and mass migrations it ended up producing. He was also dissatisfied with the distribution of areas between the two countries and considered it a major reason for the disturbances. 

== Philosophy ==
Ali&#x27;s writings, in addition to those of Muhammad Iqbal and others, were major catalysts for the formation of Pakistan. He offered the name &quot;Bangistan&quot; for a Muslim homeland in the Bengal region, and &quot;Osmanistan&quot; for a Muslim homeland in the Deccan. He also suggested &quot;Dinia&quot; as a name for a South Asia of various religions.

== Conception of &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; ==
In 1930, Ali moved to a house in Cambridge, on 3 Humberstone Road. It was in one of the rooms of this house that he is said to have written the word &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; for the first time. There are several accounts of the creation of the name. According to a friend, Abdul Kareem Jabbar, the name came up when Ali was walking along the banks of the Thames in 1932 with his friends Pir Ahsan-ud-din and Khwaja Abdul Rahim. According to Ali&#x27;s secretary Miss Frost, he came up with the idea while riding on the top of a London bus.

Sir Mohammad Iqbal said that Rahmat Ali visited him in London when he was there for the First Round Table Conference in 1930 and asked him what he would call the government of the Muslim state he had proposed in Allahabad. Iqbal told him that he would call it &quot;Pakistan&quot; as an acronym based on the provinces&#x27; names.

On 28 January 1933, Ali voiced the idea in a pamphlet titled &quot;&quot;. The word &#x27;Pakstan&#x27; referred to &quot;the five Northern units of India, viz., Punjab, North-West Frontier Province (Afghania), Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan&quot;.
By the end of 1933, &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; had become common vocabulary, and an i was added to ease pronunciation (as in Afghan-i-stan). Ali also wrote that this would be followed by &quot;reintegration of the three Muslim &#x27;Asian&#x27; homelands of Afghanistan, Iran and Tajikistan&quot; into Pakistan, a reference to Northwest India&#x27;s political, historical and cultural affiliations with West Asia.

In a subsequent book, Ali discussed the etymology in further detail:
&#x27;Pakistan&#x27; is both a Persian and an Urdu word. It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our South Asia homelands; that is, Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh and Balochistan. It means the land of the Paks – the spiritually pure and clean.

Historian Aqeel Abbas Jafari has argued that the name &quot;Pakistan&quot; was invented by a Kashmir Journalist, Ghulam Hassan Shah Kazmi on 1 July 1928, when he moved an application before the government in Abbottabad seeking a sanction for publishing a weekly newspaper, &quot;Pakistan&quot;. This was probably the first time; the word Pakistan was used in the subcontinent. Choudhry Rahmat Ali is said to have suggested the name of the independent Muslim state Pakistan in 1933, 5 years after the name was adopted by Ghulam Hasan Shah Kazmi for his newspaper.

Ali&#x27;s pamphlet described the Muslims of his proposed &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; as a &#x27;nation&#x27;, which later formed the foundation for the two-nation theory of the All-India Muslim League:

Ali believed that the delegates of the first and second Round Table Conferences committed &#x27;an inexcusable blunder and an incredible betrayal&#x27; by accepting the principle of an All-India Federation. He demanded that the national status of the 30 million Muslims of the northwestern units be recognized, and a separate Federal Constitution be granted to them.

Ali&#x27;s biographer, K. K. Aziz writes, &quot;Rahmat Ali alone drafted this declaration&quot; (in which the word Pakistan was used for the first time), but to make it &quot;representative&quot; he began to look around for people who would sign it along with him. This search did not prove easy, &quot;for so firm was the grip of &#x27;Muslim Indian Nationalism&#x27; on our young intellectuals at English universities that it took me (Rahmat Ali) more than a month to find three young men in London who offered to support and sign it.&quot; Later on, his political opponents used the name of these signatories and other friends of Ali, as creators of the word &#x27;Pakistan&#x27;.

Choudhary Rehmat Ali was the personality who started independence movement in the name of Pakistan. He gave idea of two nations in 1915. He formed Pakistan National Movement in 1934 and also released fortnightly Pakistan newspaper in 1935

== Opposition to &quot;Indianism&quot; ==
According to his writings, &quot;Indianism&quot; meant emphasizing the abode and culture of the &quot;caste Hindus&quot; as the primary and essential constituent of a subcontinent-wide nation. It was in his view Indianism was &quot;the designation of a State created by the British for the first time in history&quot;, citing that the Indian National Congress being established in 1885 as evidence that Indianism originated in the hands of the British in the service of British imperialism. He criticizes the notion of the unity of &quot;the country of India&quot;; instead he considers it a continent with a wide variety of nations, ethnicities and religions, and that the Muslims, Sikhs, the Marathas, the Achhūts (untouchables) and the Rajputs were in fact separate nations, on whom the fetters of &quot;Indianism&quot; were fastened by imposing on all of them this &quot;preposterous prefix of All-India&quot;.

==Iqbal and Jinnah==

On 29 December 1930, Muhammad Iqbal delivered his presidential address, wherein he said:

According to some scholars, Iqbal had not presented the idea of an autonomous Muslim State; rather he wanted a large Muslim province by amalgamating Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Baluchistan into a big North-Western province within India. They argue that Iqbal never called for any kind of partition of the country.

On 28 January 1933, Choudhry Rahmat Ali voiced his ideas on &#x27;Pakistan&#x27;. By the end of 1933, the word &quot;Pakistan&quot; became common vocabulary where an &quot;I&quot; was added to ease pronunciation (as in Afghan-i-stan).
In a subsequent book Rahmat Ali discussed the etymology in further detail:
&quot;&#x27;Pakistan&#x27; is both a Persian and an Urdu word. It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our South Asia homelands; that is, Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan. It means the land of the Pure.&quot;

Jawaharlal Nehru had written in his book on the scheme: &quot;Iqbal was one of the early advocates of Pakistan and yet he appears to have realised its inherent danger and absurdity. Edward Thompson has written that in the course of the conversation, Iqbal told him that he had advocated Pakistan because of his position as President of the Muslim League session, but he felt sure that it would be injurious to India as a whole and Muslims especially.&quot;

In 1934, Choudhry Rahmat Ali and his friends met Muhammad Ali Jinnah and appealed for his support of the Pakistan idea. He replied, &quot;My dear boys, don&#x27;t be in a hurry; let the waters flow and they will find their own level.&quot;

==Proposed maps and names==

Ali published several pamphlets where he called himself the &quot;Founder of the Pakistan National Movement&quot;. In these pamphlets he included maps of the subcontinent with potential Muslim states, including Haideristan, Siddiqistan, Faruqistan, Muinistan and Maplistan. Safiistan and Nasaristan were proposed on Sri Lanka.

In his maps he renamed the Indian subcontinent &#x27;Pakasia&#x27; or more often &#x27;Dinia&#x27; (an anagram of &quot;India&quot; with position of &#x27;D&#x27; changed), meaning &quot;Land of the Faith&quot; in Arabic (from the word &quot;deen&quot;). Dinia was represented with dependencies Pakistan, Osmanistan (representing Hyderabad Deccan and neighbouring areas) and Bangistan (representing Bengal). He proposed the former Muslim provinces of Eastern Bengal and Assam in East India to become Bangistan, an independent Muslim state for Bengali, Assamese and Bihari Muslims. He proposed the princely Hyderabad State, to become an Islamic monarchy called Osmanistan. Ali also renamed the seas around the Indian subcontinent, and referred the seas around landmass of Dinia as the Bangian, Pakian and Osmanian seas that were his proposed names for the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean respectively.

These alternate geographical maps of the subcontinent were followed by the mention of Rahmat Ali’s position as the &quot;founder of the Siddiqistan, Nasaristan and Safiistan National Movements&quot;. Ali even referred to the Andamans as the &quot;Ashur Islands&quot; and the Nicobars as the &quot;Balus Islands&quot; in such maps.

Mian Abdul Haq, a contemporary of Rahmat Ali at the University of Cambridge, stated that, after 1935, Rahmat Ali&#x27;s mental makeup changed resulting from a study of &quot;major Nazi works, of which he knew many passages by heart&quot;.

== After the creation of Pakistan ==
While Choudhry Rahmat Ali was a leading figure for the conception of Pakistan, he lived most of his adult life in England.

After the partition and creation of Pakistan in 1947, Ali returned to Lahore, Pakistan on 6 April 1948. He had been voicing his dissatisfaction with the creation of Pakistan ever since his arrival in Lahore. He was unhappy over a smaller Pakistan than the one he had conceived in his 1933 pamphlet. He condemned Jinnah for accepting a smaller Pakistan, calling him &quot;Quisling-e-Azam.&quot;

Ali had planned to stay in the country, but he was expelled from Pakistan by the then Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan. His belongings were confiscated, and he left empty-handed for England in October 1948.

==Death==

Ali died on 3 February 1951 in Cambridge. According to his secretary Thelma Frost, he was &quot;destitute, forlorn and lonely&quot; at the time of his death. Fearing (correctly) that he may have died insolvent, the Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Edward Welbourne, instructed that the College would cover the funeral expenses. He was buried on 20 February at Cambridge City Cemetery in Cambridge, England. The funeral expenses and other medical expenses were repaid by the High Commissioner for Pakistan in November 1953, after what was described as a “protracted correspondence” between the London office and the relevant authorities in Pakistan. 

== Legacy ==
Rahmat Ali is credited by Pakistanis for having coined the term &quot;Pakistan&quot; and envisioning a separate state for Muslims. Beyond that, his ideas are not explored in any detail.

<text>Gillnetting is a fishing method that uses gillnets: vertical panels of netting that hang from a line with regularly spaced floaters that hold the line on the surface of the water. The floats are sometimes called &quot;corks&quot; and the line with corks is generally referred to as a &quot;cork line.&quot; The line along the bottom of the panels is generally weighted. Traditionally this line has been weighted with lead and may be referred to as &quot;lead line.&quot; A gillnet is normally set in a straight line. Gillnets can be characterized by mesh size, as well as colour and type of filament from which they are made. Fish may be caught by gillnets in three ways:

# Wedged – held by the mesh around the body.
# Gilled – held by mesh slipping behind the opercula.
# Tangled – held by teeth, spines, maxillaries, or other protrusions without the body penetrating the mesh.

Most fish have gills. A fish swims into a net and passes only part way through the mesh. When it struggles to free itself, the twine slips behind the gill cover and prevents escape.

Gillnets are so effective that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and enforcement agencies. Mesh size, twine strength, as well as net length and depth are all closely regulated to reduce bycatch of non-target species. Gillnets have a high degree of size selectivity. Most salmon fisheries in particular have an extremely low incidence of catching non-target species.

A fishing vessel rigged to fish by gillnetting is a gillnetter. A gillnetter which deploys its gillnet from the bow is a [[:File:BC Bow Picker Mahalo Kai (Commercial Salmon Gillnetter).jpg|bowpicker]], while one which deploys its gillnet from the stern is a sternpicker. Gillnets differ from seines in that the latter uses a tighter weave to trap fish in an enclosed space, rather than directly catching the fish as in a gillnet.

==History==

Gillnets existed in ancient times, as archaeological evidence from the Middle East demonstrates. In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar. They would attach stones to the bottom of the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up and down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead.

Both drift gillnets and setnets have long been used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the Edo period (1603–1868). Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking Age, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery during the second half of the 19th century did so because they had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries. These are but a few of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.

Gillnetting was an early fishing technology in colonial America, used for example, in fisheries for Atlantic salmon and shad. Immigrant fishermen from northern Europe and the Mediterranean brought a number of different adaptations of the technology from their respective homelands with them to the rapidly expanding salmon fisheries of the Columbia River from the 1860s onward. The boats used by these fisherman were typically around long and powered by oars. Many of these boats also had small sails and were called &quot;row-sail&quot; boats. At the beginning of the 1900s, steam powered ships would haul these smaller boats to their fishing grounds and retrieve them at the end of each day. However, at that time gas powered boats were beginning to make their appearance, and by the 1930s, the row-sail boat had virtually disappeared, except in Bristol Bay, Alaska, where motors were prohibited in the gillnet fishery by territorial law until 1951.
In 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum is a circular device that is set to the side of the boat and draws in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster and along with the faster gas powered boats, fisherman were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry.

During World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (ex. depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact. These devices became much more accessible to the average fisherman, thus making their range and mobility increasingly larger. It also served to make the industry much more competitive, as the fisherman were forced to invest more in boats and equipment to stay current with developing technology.

The introduction of fine synthetic fibres such as nylon in the construction of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, multifilament nylon, monofilament or multimonofilament fibres become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.

Nylon is highly resistant to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting has the potential to last for many years if it is not recovered. This ghost fishing is of environmental concern. Attaching the gillnet floats with biodegradable material can reduce the problem. However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching fish and crustaceans over a year after loss, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month or overgrown with seaweeds, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential to such an extent that they became a microhabitat used by small fish.

This type of net was heavily used by many Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese fishing fleets on the high seas in the 1980s to target tunas. Although highly selective with respect to size class of animals captured, gillnets are associated with high numbers of incidental captures of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). In the Sri Lankan gillnet fishery, one dolphin is caught for every 1.7–4.0 tonnes of tuna landed. This compares poorly with the rate of one dolphin per 70 tonnes of tuna landed in the eastern Pacific purse seine tuna fishery.

Many types of gillnets are used by fisheries scientists to monitor fish populations. Vertical gillnets are designed to allow scientists to determine the depth distribution of the captured fish.

==Legal status==
United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/215 called for the cessation of all &quot;large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing&quot; in international waters by the end of 1992. The laws of individual countries vary with regard to fishing in waters under their jurisdiction.

Possession of gillnets is illegal in some U.S. states and heavily regulated in others.

Oregon voters had the chance to decide on whether gillnetting will continue in the Columbia River in November 2012 by voting on Measure 81. The measure was defeated with 65% of Oregon voters voting against the measure and allowing commercial gillnet fishing to continue on the Columbia River.

The Columbia River Basin is currently under a management agreement that spans from 2008 to December 31, 2017. This management agreement looks to gather information on fish harvesting through means including gillnets. The parties involved will convene again to decide on further action after the current agreement ends.

The gill-netting season in Minnesota can vary from county to county and the net types used are regulated on a lake by lake basis by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Virginia&#x27;s gill-netting season is regulated by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. During different months of the year, certain rivers have restricted mesh sizes, which vary by location.

There have been proposed regulations to shut down drift gillnet fisheries whose by-catch numbers (which include dolphins, sea turtles and other marine life) were too high. In 2014, California lawmakers pushed for the banning of gillnet fishing through letters to federal fishing companies. The progress for these regulations have been paused in California mid 2017.

According to the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act from 1996, a permit is require for all commercial fishing vessels that are registered in the United States and under this act, vessels must have a record of all their fishing efforts on the high seas.

As of November 2017, there has been a bill introduced to improve the management of driftnets, with gillnets being under the umbrella of this fishing tool. The bill&#x27;s focus is to ban the use of large-scale nets while supporting the use of alternative methods of fishing to decrease the maximum amount of bycatch. There is also a compensation plan proposed in the bill for fishery participants who stop using large-scale nets.

==Selectivity==
Gillnets are a series of panels of meshes with a weighted &quot;foot rope&quot; along the bottom, and a &quot;headline&quot;, to which floats are attached. By altering the ratio of floats to weights, buoyancy changes, and the net can therefore be set to fish at any depth in the water column. In commercial fisheries, the meshes of a gillnet are uniform in size and shape. Fish smaller than the mesh of the net pass through unhindered, while those too large to push their heads through the meshes as far as their gills are not retained. This gives gillnets the ability to target a specific size of fish, unlike other net gears such as trawls, in which smaller fish pass through the meshes and all larger fish are captured in the net.

===Salmon===
Commercial gillnet fisheries are still an important method of harvesting salmon in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. In the lower Columbia River, non-Indian commercial salmon fisheries for spring Chinook have developed methods of selectively harvesting adipose fin clipped hatchery salmon using small mesh gillnets known as tangle nets or tooth nets. Non-adipose fin clipped fish (primarily natural origin salmon) must be released. Fishery management agencies estimate a relatively low release mortality rate on salmon and steelhead released from these small mesh gillnets.

Problems that can arise from selective harvesting are smaller reproducing adult fish, as well as the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (&gt;550 mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946 to 2005 was 8 mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs. If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11–29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.

Gillnets are sometimes a controversial gear type especially among sport fishers who argue they are inappropriate especially for salmon fisheries. These arguments are often related to allocation issues between commercial and recreational (sport) fisheries and not conservation issues. Most salmon fisheries, especially those targeting Pacific salmon in North America, are strictly managed to minimize total impacts to specific populations and salmon fishery managers continue to allow the use of gillnets in these fisheries.

===Swordfish===
Gillnets are also used out in the deep sea for fisheries whose primary catch is swordfish. California driftnet fisheries have some of the highest rates of by-catch with 12 percent of the catch being the targeted swordfish while up to 68 percent of the catch being by-catch that will be tossed back to sea.

===Alternatives===
Given the selective properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest are currently being studied. Recent WDF&amp;W reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest catch per unit effort (CPUE), but has little information on the effectiveness of selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon. More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets. A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines, whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.

There have also been studies done to see if differing strategies could potentially decrease the estimated 400,000 annual avian by-catch in coastal fisheries. These include three strategies that have a possible reduction in up to 75% of avian by-catch: gear modifications, where visual devices will be placed near the top of the net so birds will be able to see the nets; abundance-based fishery openings, where of birds will determine whether the nets will be set out or not; and time-of-day restrictions, which goes along with abundance- where bird by catch tended to occur at dawn and dusk, where as fish catch occurred mostly at dawn.

For marine mammal by-catch, field experiments have shown that the use of pingers on nets resulted in significantly lower numbers of by-catch than nets without pingers. After this study was completed by Jay Barlow, it was determined that there would be a 12-fold decrease in short-beaked common dolphins caught, a 4-fold decrease in other cetaceans and a 3-fold decrease in pinnipeds for nets containing pingers.

==Types of gillnets==
The FAO classifies gillnet gear types as follows:

===Set gillnets===
Set gillnets consist of a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based on the relationship of fuel/fish.

===Encircling gillnets===
Encircling gillnets are gillnets set vertically in shallow water, with the floatline remaining at the surface so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes can be used to set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment. As soon as the gear is set the scaring takes place and the net is hauled back in. The fish are alive and discards can be returned to the sea. Encircling gillnets are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.

===Combined gillnets-trammel nets===
This bottom-set gear has two parts:
* the upper part is a standard gillnet where semi-demersal or pelagic fish can be gilled
* the lower part is a trammel net where bottom fish can entangle.

The combined nets are maintained more or less vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is ghost fishing by lost nets and bycatch of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.

===Drift nets===

A drift net consists of one or more panels of webbing fastened together. They are left free to drift with the current, usually near the surface or not far below it. Floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline keep them vertical. Drift nets drift with the current while they are connected with the operating vessel, the driftnetter or drifter.

Drift nets are usually used to catch schooling forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually used to set and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern with this type of net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.

===Gillnets and entangling nets===
The tangle net, or tooth net, originated in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They are designed to catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of . Short net lengths and soak times are used in an effort to land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.

<text>The Bobbsey Twins are the principal characters of what was, for 75 years, the Stratemeyer Syndicate&#x27;s longest-running series of American children&#x27;s novels, written under the pseudonym Laura Lee Hope. The first of 72 books was published in 1904, the last in 1979, with a separate series of 30 books published from 1987 through 1992. The books related the adventures of the children of the upper-middle-class Bobbsey family, which included two sets of fraternal twins: Bert and Nan, who were eight years old, and Flossie and Freddie, who were four when the first book was written. The two sets of twins aged as the series went on. As the series continued, the two sets of twins were perpetually aged at 12 and 6.

==Authorship==

Edward Stratemeyer is believed to be the writer of the first volume in its original form in 1904. When the original series was brought to its conclusion in 1979, it reached a total of 72 volumes. At least two attempts to restart the series were launched after this, but neither effort saw the popularity the original series achieved.

Speculation that Stratemeyer also wrote the second and third volumes of the series is believed to be incorrect; these books are attributed to Lilian Garis, wife of Howard Garis, credited with volumes 4–28 and 41. Elizabeth Ward is credited with volumes 29–35, while Harriet Stratemeyer Adams is credited with 36–38, 39 (with Camilla McClave), 40, 42, 43 (with Andrew Svenson), and 44–48. Volumes 49–52 are attributed to Andrew Svenson, while 53–59, and the 1960s rewrites of 1–4, 7, 11–13, and 17, are attributed to June Dunn. Grace Grote is regarded as the author of 60–67 and the rewrites of 14 and 18–20, and Nancy Axelrad is credited with 68–72. Of the 1960s rewrites not mentioned, volumes 5 and 16 are credited to Mary Donahoe, 6 and 25 to Patricia Doll, 8–10 and 15 to Bonnibel Weston, and 24 to Margery Howard.

==Plots==

In the original editions, the first books in the series (like those in previous Stratemeyer series) took place in a clear chronology, with the characters aging as time passed. &quot;The Bobbsey Twins: Merry Days Indoors and Out&quot; took place over the course of a school year, with Nan and Bert described as eight years old and Freddie and Flossie four. The second book, &quot;The Bobbsey Twins in the Country&quot; is set at the beginning of the following summer. The second part of the summer is chronicled in &quot;The Bobbsey Twins at the Seashore&quot;, which is written as a direct sequel to the previous book, tying up some plot threads. The fourth book, &quot;The Bobbsey Twins at School&quot;, begins the next autumn, with Nan and Bert &quot;nearly nine years old&quot; and Freddie and Flossie &quot;almost five.&quot; Editors at the Stratemeyer Syndicate quickly realized, at this rate, their young heroes would quickly age beyond their readership, so the later books in the series (and revised editions) take place in a sort of chronological stasis, with the older twins perpetually 12 years old and the younger set 6.

The earliest Bobbsey books were mainly episodic strings of adventures; with the growing popularity of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, detective plots began to dominate the series. Few of the mysteries involved violent crime, and quite a few did not involve any crime.

While many of the early volumes were constructed from whole cloth, with little or no connection to the real world, by 1917 (&quot;The Bobbsey Twins in a Great City,&quot; vol. 9, rewritten in 1960 as &quot;The Bobbsey Twins&#x27; Search in the Great City&quot;) they visit real places, and by the 1950s (&quot;The Bobbsey Twins at Pilgrim Rock&quot; vol. 50), those visits to real places were as well-researched as any fictional visits to real places. By 1971, when the Bobbseys visited Colonial Williamsburg (&quot;The Bobbsey Twins&#x27; Red White and Blue Mystery,&quot; vol. 64), real places were depicted in meticulous detail, down to the names of well-known hotels and restaurants (and, in that particular case, the color of Colonial Williamsburg shuttle buses).

It is said vol. 68, &quot;The Bobbsey Twins on the Sun-Moon Cruise,&quot; was the result of a research trip for a proposed Nancy Drew book: Harriet Stratemeyer Adams and Nancy Axelrad (her personal assistant at the time) took an eclipse cruise but, when they returned, the publisher was more interested in a new Bobbsey title.

==Post-1960 rewrites==
In 1960, the Stratemeyer syndicate rewrote most of the older volumes, many of which became almost unrecognizable in the process. This was concurrent with the release of a new edition of the series, with picture covers, no dust jackets, and a lavender spine and back cover (replacing earlier various green bindings). Many of the cover paintings were dust-jacket paintings added in the 1950s (for earlier versions, a single common dust-jacket painting was used throughout an edition), but most were new with the &quot;purple&quot; edition. In all, twenty were completely rewritten, all but two with modernized titles, while sixteen were never released in this edition, evidently deemed to be dated beyond repair.

Most of the rewrites were motivated by changing technology (automobiles replacing horses and buggies) or changing social standards, particularly in how Sam and Dinah, the black cook and handyman, were portrayed. &quot;The Bobbsey Twins and Baby May&quot; received the most extreme rewrite; it is a story about the Bobbsey family&#x27;s adventures searching for the parents of a foundling baby. Since, by the 1960s, sheer numbers of government agencies rendered the original story utterly implausible, an entirely new novel was written about the twins&#x27; adventures with a baseball-playing baby elephant (&quot;The Bobbsey Twins&#x27; Adventures with Baby May&quot;). This, however, had a ripple effect, because the original &quot;The Bobbsey Twins at Cloverbank&quot; was a sequel to the original &quot;Baby May.&quot; Thus, a second book, &quot;The Bobbsey Twins and the Four-Leaf Clover Mystery,&quot; was written. It incorporates little material from the original.

==New Bobbsey Twins==
Starting in 1987, a numbered series of paperback originals branded &quot;The New Bobbsey Twins&quot; were released by Minstrel Books, an imprint of Pocket Books. Featuring all-new stories, the series ended with volume 30, &quot;The Mystery of the Mixed-Up Mall&quot;, in 1992.

==Analysis==
In her book &quot;The Rhetoric of Character in Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, Maria Nikolajeva refers to the twins as a &quot;simple duplication of protagonists&quot;. Bobbie Ann Mason, in &quot;The Girl Sleuth: A Feminist Guide&quot;, differs, agreeing the books afford the child-reader an opportunity to imagine &quot;a union with someone just like her, but of the opposite sex&quot;, but arguing the distinction between boy-twin and girl-twin &quot;makes a world of difference&quot;: Bert &quot;acts out his manhood by winning contests and beating the town bully, Danny Rugg&quot;, while his twin Nan – throughout the series &quot;too old for dolls and pranks, too young for boys and barred from their games&quot; – spends most of her time in the books &quot;wagging her finger at Freddie and appearing to enjoy it&quot;, acting as &quot;mini-parent, non-child, serious-minded little manipulator&quot;.

== In other media ==
Re-imagined versions of the Bobbsey twins appear in The CW drama &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, an adaptation of another Stratemeyer Syndicate series. In the series, the twins are given the full names of Amanda and Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; and are respectively played by Aadila Dosani and Praneet Akilla.

<doc id="1003359" wikidata="Q3931533" url="?curid=1003359" title="Redleg">
<text>Redleg is a term used to refer to poor whites that live or at one time lived on Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada and a few other Caribbean islands. Their forebears were sent from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Continental Europe as indentured servants, forced labourers, or peons.

== Etymology ==
According to folk etymology, the name is derived from the effects of the tropical sun on the fair-skinned legs of white emigrants, now known as sunburn. However, the term &quot;Redlegs&quot; and its variants were also in use for Irish soldiers who were taken as prisoners of war in the Irish Confederate Wars and transported to Barbados as indentured servants. 

In addition to &quot;Redlegs&quot;, the term underwent extensive progression in Barbados and the following terms were also used: &quot;Redshanks&quot;, &quot;Poor whites&quot;, &quot;Poor Backra&quot;, &quot;Backra Johnny&quot;, &quot;Ecky-Becky&quot;, &quot;Johnnies&quot; or &quot;Poor Backward Johnnies&quot;, &quot;Poor whites from below the hill&quot;, &quot;Edey white mice&quot; or &quot;Beck-e Neck&quot; (Baked-neck). Historically, anything besides &quot;poor whites&quot; were used as derogatory insults.

== History ==
Many of the Redlegs&#x27; ancestors were transported by Oliver Cromwell after his conquest of Ireland. Others had originally arrived on Barbados in the early to mid-17th century as indentured servants, to work on the sugar plantations. Small groups of Germans and Portuguese prisoners of war were also imported as plantation labourers. After the Monmouth rebellion, one thousand two hundred rebels were sold as slaves for the Barbados plantations.

By the 18th century, indentured servants became less common. African slaves were trained in all necessary trades, so there was no demand for paid white labour. The Redlegs, in turn, were unwilling to work alongside the freed black population on the plantations. 

Because of the deplorable conditions under which the Redlegs lived, a campaign was initiated in the mid-19th century to move portions of the population to other islands which would be more economically hospitable. The relocation process succeeded, and a distinct community of Redleg descendants live in the Dorsetshire Hill District on St. Vincent as well as on the islands of Grenada around Mt. Moritz and Bequia.

The term &quot;Redleg&quot; is also used in South Carolina, where Barbadians had settled.

<text>Sahabzada Mohammad Yaqub Ali Khan ( ; 23 December 1920 – 26 January 2016) was a Pakistani politician, diplomat, military figure, linguist, and a retired general in the Pakistani Army.

After the Partition of India in 1947, he opted for Pakistan and joined the Pakistan Army where he participated in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. He was the commander of the army&#x27;s Eastern Command in East Pakistan. He was appointed as governor of East Pakistan in 1969 and 1971 but recalled to Pakistan after he submitted his resignation amid civil unrest. In 1973, he joined the foreign service and was appointed as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States and later ascended as foreign minister, serving under President Zia-ul-Haq in 1982.

His stint as foreign minister played a major role in the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (1979–89) and he took part in negotiations to end the Contras in Nicaragua (1981–87) on the behalf of the United Nations. In the 1990s, he served as an official of the United Nations for Western Sahara until he was reappointed as foreign minister under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. After retiring from diplomatic services in 1997, he spent his remaining years in Islamabad and died in Islamabad in 2016.

==Biography==

===Youth and World war II===

==== Early days ====
Mohammad Yaqub Ali Khan was born into Indian nobility into the Rohilla branch of the Kheshgi family Pashtun tribe in Rampur, United Provinces, British Indian Empire on 23 December 1920. He had also been a close relative of the family of the Nawabs of Kasur, of Punjab. His father, Sir Abdus Samad Khan was an aristocrat and politician who served as chief minister of Rampur, and as British India&#x27;s representative to the League of Nations.

He was educated at the Rashtriya Indian Military College at Dehradun, then the Indian Military Academy and gained a commission in British Indian Army in 1940 and attached to the 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry.

==== Participation in WWII and POW ====
In his military career he saw action during World War II and served in the North African campaign where he was attached to 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry from April 1942. He was taken prisoner of war in North Africa in May 1942. In September 1943 he escaped from the Italian prisoner of war camp P. G. 91 in Avezzano (with two other Indian officers) and was out for four to five months attempting to move south to Allied lines, but they were subsequently re-captured by German forces who put him in a prisoner of war camp in Germany until April 1945 when he was released by the U.S. Army soldiers. During his time in German custody, he learnt languages by interacting with fellow prisoners and reading literature in those languages.

==== Return to India and Partition ====
Upon returning to India in 1945, he was selected as an adjutant to Field Marshal Lord Wavell with an army rank of major. After hearing the news of partition of India and creation of Pakistan, he decided to opt for Pakistan, and initially was selected as aide-de-camp (ADC) to Muhammad Ali Jinnah– the first Governor-General of Pakistan. It was then-Lieutenant S.M. Ahsan who was made the ADC at the behest of Lord Mountbatten, and Yaqub was appointed as commandant of the Governor-General&#x27;s bodyguard for the first governor-general which he led until 1948. In the period 1948–49, he attended the short one-year course at the Command and Staff College at Quetta and graduated with a staff officer&#x27;s degree.

In 1951, he served in the Military Intelligence (MI) as lieutenant-colonel, and directed initiatives to analytical branch of the ISI for the whereabouts of the Indian Army but he reportedly struggled with providing factual intelligence that was provided to ISI.

He commanded the 11th Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force), Armoured Corps from December 1952 to October 1953.

He was promoted to colonel in 1953 and went to Paris in France to attend the famed École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr where he graduated in 1954.

Upon returning to Pakistan, he was promoted to brigadier in 1955 where he served as a chief instructor at the Command and Staff College.

===Staff and war appointments: 1960–69===
In 1958, he was appointed as the vice chief of general staff at the army GHQ and later becoming the commandant of the Command and Staff College in Quetta in 1960. In 1960 he was promoted to major-general and commanded the 1st Armoured Division of Armoured Corps and was said to have a portrait of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in his office. As an armored commander, he arranged a course on philosophy on the &quot;panzer&quot; doctrine to educate the armoured division on the tank battles and strategies.

He participated in the war against India in 1965, having command of his 1st Armoured Division. He helped develop the operational planning of the armoured vehicular warfare deployments against the Indian Army advances in Punjab and presented his views at the Army GHQ. Soon after, he was appointed as director-general military operations (DGMO) by General Musa Khan and directed all formats of ground operations during the 1965 war against India.

After the war, he was appointed as chief of general staff at the army GHQ under army chief General Yahya Khan in 1966 and remained until 1969.

===East Pakistan: military advisor and governorship (1969–71)===

In 1969, Lieutenant-General Yaqub Khan was posted to East Pakistan as the commander of Eastern Command in Dacca by President Yahya Khan and helped evaluate the command rotation of the eastern military. Soon, he was appointed as governor of East Pakistan where he began learning the Bengali language and became accustomed to Bengali culture. He was highly respected by the East Pakistani military officers due to his stance and professionalism and was said to be very well liked and respected in the East.

He was known to be an unusual military officer who knew very well about &quot;limits of force&quot;, and did not believe in the use of brute force to settle political disputes. In 1969–71, he worked together with Admiral Ahsan in advising the Yahya administration in an effort to resolve the situation and restricted strictly the proposal of usage of military force in the province.

At the cabinet meeting, he was often fierce and strictly resisted the usage of military option but was respected in the military due to his understanding of Bengali issues and whose colleagues often labeled him as &quot;Bingos.&quot; In 1970, he notably coordinated the relief operations when the disastrous cyclone had hit the state and gained prestige for his efforts in the country.

In 1971, he participated in the area contingency and fact-finding mission, which was known as the Ahsan–Yaqub Mission, to resolve the political deadlock between East Pakistan and Pakistan as both men argued that &quot;military measures would not change the political situations&quot;.

In March 1971, he became aware of the rumors of a military action against East Pakistanis and delivered desperate military signals to President Yahya Khan in Islamabad to not use military solution as he feared Indian intervention. After the resignation of Admiral Ahsan, he was ordered to use military force against the civil agitation led by the Awami League but refused to take this order and tendered his resignation to be posted back to Pakistan. His resignation came in the light of resisting the military orders and fiercely maintained to President Yahya that &quot;military solution was not acceptable&quot;.

Commenting on the situation, Yaqub maintained that: &quot;[President] Yahya was also keen to impose the &quot;open sword&quot; martial law to roll back the situation as it was in 1969.&quot; He lodged a strong protest against the military solution and maintained that the &quot;central government had failed to listen to the voices of their co-citizens in the East.&quot; To many authors, Yaqub Khan had become a &quot;conscientious objector&quot; in the military.

He was posted back to Pakistan, joined the Army GHQ staff and participated in winter war against India in 1971 without commanding an assignment and retired from the military after the war, also in 1971.

==Foreign service==
===Ambassadorship to France, United States, and Soviet Union===
After seeking the honorable discharge from the army, he joined the foreign service as a career diplomat in 1972, initially taking his first assignment as Pakistan Ambassador to France until 1973. In 1973, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appointed him as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States which he served in this capacity until 1979. He was sent Pakistan&#x27;s envoy to United States when the foreign relations with the United States were cooling but he gained international prominence when he became involved with Egyptian ambassador Ashraf Ghorbal and Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ardeshir Zahedi to take part in defusing the siege of three federal buildings in the Washington D.C. by the group of American Muslims in 1977.

In 1979, he was sent to Moscow and was appointed as Pakistan Ambassador to the Soviet Union where he worked towards building foreign relations with the Soviet Union by signing an educational accord. In 1980, he was reassigned in France again where he remained until 1982.

===Foreign minister and United Nations===
Yaqub Ali Khan was brought in to the Zia administration as foreign minister in 1982 when Agha Shahi departed President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s cabinet. He was appointed foreign minister in the conservative-aligned government but Yaqub maintained his composure and his wit in the Zia administration.

As foreign minister, he directed a proactive and keen pro-Islamic policy and supported the U.S. sponsored clandestine program to arm the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet-sponsored Socialist Afghanistan. He advised President Zia-ul-Haq on many key matters and firmly had gripped the country&#x27;s foreign policy on the track of pro-U.S. foreign policy as many military officers joined his foreign ministry. During this time, the matters were kept out of the sight of the Foreign Office with Yaqub handling matters with the military. He continued his role as foreign minister after the general elections held in 1985 by the Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo.

At foreign fronts, he played a crucial role in providing the support for his country&#x27;s cover and clandestine nuclear development whilst maintaining a strong policy of deliberate ambiguity. In 1984, he reportedly issued a statement in Washington, D.C., on Pakistan&#x27;s massive retaliation when observing India&#x27;s pre-emptive strikes on Pakistan&#x27;s facilities, and made unsuccessful proposal to United States to put Pakistan under its nuclear umbrella.

In the 1980s, he provided his diplomatic expertise in resolving the Soviet–Afghan War when he explored the possibility of setting-up the interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq. In 1984–85, he paid visits to China, Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom to develop framework for the Geneva Accords which was signed in 1988. About the death and state funeral of President Zia-ul-Haq, Yaqub was earlier warned by Soviet Foreign Minister Edward Shevardnadze that Pakistan&#x27;s support for the Afghan mujahideen &quot;would not go unpunished.&quot;

In the 1980s, he also managed to maintain Pakistan&#x27;s close friendship with Iran and the rich Arab States during the Iran-Iraq war. After the general elections held in 1988 in the country, Yaqub was kept as foreign minister in the first Benazir ministry by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in order to engage in negotiation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In 1988–90, he aided Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to reach agreement to sign an arms control treaty with her Indian counterpart Rajiv Gandhi. In 1990, he met Indian External Minister, I. K. Gujral to deter an active conflict between two countries.

After the 1990 Pakistani general election, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made him foreign minister, a position he retained until 1991. He once again put country&#x27;s foreign policy to supporting U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in the Gulf War. After the Gulf War, Yaqub resigned his post as foreign minister on 26 February 1991.

After his resignation, he went on to join the United Nations when he was named the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara in 1992 which he remained until 1995. In 1996, he was again re-appointed as foreign minister by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto but it was short-lived when his tenure was cut-short after President Farooq Leghari dismissed Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government.

Although he retired from politics in 1997, Yaqub Ali Khan did provide his support to President Pervez Musharraf to stabilise his writ against the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 when he visited United States to provide legitimacy of military martial law.

==Post-retirement and death==
In 1981, he was appointed as the founding chairman of the board of trustees of the Aga Khan University which he chaired for almost two decades until his retirement in 2001. He was also a commissioner in the now retired Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict in New York City, United States.

Yaqub Ali Khan was married to Begum Tuba Khaleeli of the Iranian Khaleeli family of Calcutta with whom he had two sons, Samad and Najib. He was said to be proficient in seven global languages including English, Russian, French, Urdu, German, Italian, and Bengali. He died of an old age, at 95, in Islamabad where he was laid to rest in Westridge cemetery in Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan. His funeral services were attended by then CJCSC General Rashad Mahmood, then COAS General Raheel Sharif, then Air Chief General Sohail Aman, then Naval Chief Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah and other high-ranking civil and military officials and people from all walks of life.

<text>Menudo, also known as Mondongo, pancita (&quot;[little] gut&quot; or &quot;[little] stomach&quot;) or mole de panza (&quot;stomach sauce&quot;), is a traditional Mexican soup, made with cow&#x27;s stomach (tripe) in broth with a red chili pepper base. It is the Mexican variation of the Spanish callos or &quot;menudo&quot;. Similar dishes exist throughout Latin America and Europe including mondongo, guatitas, dobrada , in Italy, trippa alla romana, and in Greece  patsas - πατσάς  .

Hominy (in Northern Mexico), lime, onions, and oregano are used to season the broth. It differs from the Filipino dish of the same name, in that the latter does not use tripe, hominy, or a chili sauce.

==History==

Tripe soups of both beef and mutton have been traditional in Spanish cuisine since at least the 14th century. Don Enrique de Villena refers to them disparagingly in his &quot;Arte Cisoria&quot; (1423), saying: The first part of the novel &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; (1599) mentions the protagonist eating beef tripe callos.

With the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish introduced the tradition of &quot;menudo&quot; or tripe soups throughout the Americas, including Mexico. In the Mexican cookbook &quot;Nuevo y Sencillo Arte de Cocina, Reposteria y Refrescos&quot; (1836), Antonia Carrillo includes many &quot;menudo&quot; recipes, including a beef or mutton caldo de menudo (menudo soup), a veal menudo soup, and a &quot;menudo sopa&quot; (bread pudding).

In his cookbook &quot;Diccionario de Cocina o El Nuevo Cocinero Mexicano&quot; (1845), Manuel Galvan Rivera defined “menudo” in Mexico as: 

==Regional variations==

There are a number of regional variations on menudo. In northern Mexico, hominy is typically added. In northwest states such as Sinaloa and Sonora usually only the &quot;blanco,&quot; (white) variation is seen; &quot;menudo blanco&quot; is the same dish, but red pepper is not added (though jalapeño or chopped green chilies may be included to replace the spice in the red version), thus giving the broth a clear or white color. In Southern Arizona the typical adornments for menudo blanco are freshly chopped onion and cilantro, lemon, and ground chiltepín. Adding &quot;patas&quot; (beef or pig&#x27;s feet) to the stew is popular in the United States. In some areas of central Mexico, &quot;menudo&quot; refers to a stew of sheep stomach, &quot;pancitas&quot; stew of beef tongue. In south-western Mexico (in and around the Distrito Federal, Morelos, and Guerrero) it is called &quot;panza&quot; or &quot;panza guisada&quot;. The red variation is usually seen in the northern state of Chihuahua and Nuevo León . Only yellow hominy is usually used in menudo in Texas. A similar stew made with more easily cooked meat is pozole. Some variations of menudo substitute garbanzo beans instead of hominy.

===Menudo in the United States===

In the United States, since the mid-20th century, prepared menudo has been common in food stores and restaurants in cosmopolitan areas and in other areas with a significant Mexican population. Restaurants often feature it as a special on Saturday and Sunday, and some believe menudo alleviates hangovers. Canned menudo is also available.

An annual Menudo Festival is held in Santa Maria, California. In 2009, more than 2,000 people attended and 13 restaurants competed for prizes in three categories. The festival is organized by the National Latino Peace Officers Association of Northern Santa Barbara County and the money raised goes toward scholarships for local students.

Since 1996, the Menudo Bowl is an annual event in Laredo, Texas. In 2019, over 30 teams participated to make the best menudo. The event is organized by Laredo Crime Stoppers, with teams conformed by public officials, law enforcement, media representatives, and members of the community. The event is attended by people from both sides of the US–Mexico border.

===Cultural significance===
In the United States, among Tejanos and Chicanos, Menudo is traditionally prepared by the entire family, and often serves as an occasion for social interactions such as after wedding receptions where the families of the newlyweds go to one of their family&#x27;s houses to enjoy a bowl of menudo before and after the ceremony. It is also believed to be a hangover cure.

Menudo takes a long time to prepare as the tripe takes hours to cook. It includes many ingredients and side dishes (such as salsa), and is garnished with chopped onions, chiles, cilantro, and often with lime juice; it is often prepared communally and eaten at a feast. 

Documents from the American Works Progress Administration indicate that in the 1930s, among migrant workers in Arizona, menudo parties were held regularly to celebrate births, Christmas, and other occasions.

It is typically served with chopped raw onions, oregano, diced chiles (usually serrano), and lemon or lime segments along with corn or flour tortillas.

<text>Richard R. Chrysler (born April 29, 1942) is an American businessman and former politician who was a U.S. Representative from Michigan from 1995 until 1997.

== Biography ==
Chrysler was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and graduated from Brighton High School in Brighton, Michigan. He became vice-president of Hurst Performance and the founder and president of Cars and Concepts (which bought out Hurst), and Richard Chrysler Industries (RCI).

In 1986, he campaigned for governor of Michigan as a Republican, but lost a hard-fought primary to Wayne County Executive William Lucas.

Chrysler lost his first campaign for the United States House of Representatives to Bob Carr in 1992, in a race described as &quot;the most expensive Congressional race in Michigan that cycle.&quot; After Carr gave up his seat to run for Senate, however, Chrysler was elected in 1994 as a Republican member of the Amway caucus from Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district to the 104th Congress. He served from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 1997. While in Congress, he sponsored eight bills and co-sponsored 183 more, including the Defense of Marriage Act. He supported the Contract with America, and proposed replacing the federal income tax and capital gains tax with a 15% sales tax. He was defeated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow in the 1996 election for the 105th Congress.

Following his political career, Chrysler returned to the automotive industry, exploring battery technologies for electric vehicles. &quot;We&#x27;ve been getting ready for four years now,&quot; he told Crain&#x27;s Detroit Business in 1996. &quot;It&#x27;s time to get going. This market is on the verge of exploding.&quot;

<text>This is a list of the Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia of the Holy See of Cilicia (full name: the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, ).
The Armenian patriarchate was transferred from Armenia to Cilicia in 1058. Although the see at Echmiadzin was restored in 1441, the Cilician catholicosate continued in existence, and continues to exist to the present day. Today the see is located in Antelias, Lebanon. The Catholicos of Armenia and All Armenians claims sovereignty over the Catholicos of Cilicia, though the latter operates independently.

<text>Jonas Lie (April 29, 1880 – January 18, 1940) was a Norwegian-born American painter and teacher.

Lie is best known for his Expressionist paintings of the New England coastline and New York City. He documented construction of the Panama Canal with thirty canvases, and represented the United States in the 1928 Summer Olympics art competition.

==Background==
Lie was born in Moss, in Østfold county, Norway. His father Sverre Lie (1841–1892) was a Norwegian civil engineer and his mother Helen Augusta Steele (1853–1906) was an American from Hartford, Connecticut. He was named for his father&#x27;s cousin (and brother-in-law), the famous Norwegian author Jonas Lie, who had married his father&#x27;s sister Thomasine.

Following his father&#x27;s death in 1892, 12-year-old Lie was sent to live with Thomasine and Jonas Lie in Paris. His aunt and uncle&#x27;s home was a meeting place for famous artists such as Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Edvard Grieg, and Georg Brandes. He had already received drawing instruction from Christian Skredsvig in Norway, and Lie attended a small private art school in Paris. The following year he traveled to the United States, where he joined his mother and sisters in New York City.
From 1897–1906, he trained at the Art Students League of New York.

==Career==
Between 1901 and the memorial exhibition in 1940 his work was shown all over America. In 1905 Lie exhibited 34 pictures in the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn Museum of Art. Between 1905 and 1938 Lie had 57 one-man shows, each including from 12 to 45 paintings. He participated in important annual and biennial exhibitions at the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington as well as most of the world fairs.

Lie traveled to Panama in 1913, to paint scenes of the construction of the Panama Canal. His thirty resulting canvases brought him wide acclaim. In 1929, twelve of these were donated to United States Military Academy in memory General George W. Goethals, the West Point graduate who had been the canal&#x27;s chief engineer.

In 1932, King Haakon conferred on Lie Norway&#x27;s highest civilian honor, making him a Knight of the Order of St. Olav.

Lie was a member of various art organizations including the Salmagundi Club and was active in the National Academy of Design. Among Lie&#x27;s students was the New Hope School painter John Fulton Folinsbee.

Jonas Lie often depicted the sea, channels, and ships with dramatic perspective and powerful use of color. He became known for colorful impressionistic scenes of harbors and coves, painted during the many summers he spent on the coasts of New England and Canada. Throughout his prolific career he painted brilliantly colored images of the rocky coves and harbors that identify the region&#x27;s dramatic shoreline. Lie painted a landscape mural in honor of his wife, Sonia, in the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Society of Plainfield, New Jersey in 1929. It is inscribed, &quot;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.&quot; Paintings of Jonas Lie are on exhibit at art museums throughout the United States including at Utah Museum of Fine Arts; Cornell Fine Arts Museum; Phoenix Art Museum; San Diego Museum of Art; Corcoran Gallery of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Brooklyn Museum of Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art; High Museum of Art; the Detroit Institute of Arts and at the Memorial Art Gallery.

==Honors, exhibitions and awards==
Lie was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1912, and a full member in 1925. He served as NAD&#x27;s president from 1934 to 1939.
He was invited to exhibit four paintings in New York City&#x27;s 1913 Armory Show: &quot;The Black Teapot&quot;, &quot;At the Aquarium&quot;, &quot;A Hill Top&quot;, &quot;The Quarry&quot;.

Ryokuu was a distinguished aphorist, as well as one of the most outspoken critics. Collections of his aphorisms were published in the late 20th century.

In 1904, the tuberculosis which had plagued Ryokuu for years worsened, and no medical care helped him recuperate. On his deathbed, he referred Ichiyō&#x27;s diaries, which he had hoped to publish, to Baba Kochō, and dictated him his own obituary. He died in the morning of 13 April of the same year.

<text>Dr. Brain is a series of educational games introduced by Sierra On-Line in 1992. The objective of each game is to solve a series of puzzles to aid characters named Dr. Brain who changed from title to title. After Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996, the series would be continued by their Knowledge Adventure division who turned it into a more action-oriented game.

==Games==
===Sierra===
Sierra produced four titles in the series from 1992 to 1996. The first two games, &quot;Castle of Dr. Brain&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Island of Dr. Brain&quot; (1992), are hybrid puzzle adventure games created by an in-house team at Sierra. After the second game was released, Sierra acquired another company, Bright Star Technology, known for its educational games. The series was turned over to a Bright Star team, explaining the change in direction from the second game to the third. The third and fourth are &quot;The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Time Warp of Dr. Brain&quot; (1996).

The first two Sierra games follow Dr. Thaddeus Egghead Brain, an elderly absentminded professor, while the last two follow Dr. Thaddeaus Puzzle Brain the Third (the brother of Egghead and uncle of Dr. Elaina Brain). Dr. Brain was &#x27;reincarnated&#x27; as Dr. Cranium in &quot;Quest for Glory IV&quot; (both &quot;Dr. Brain&quot; and &quot;Quest for Glory&quot; series are designed by Corey Cole, though Dr. Cranium mentions once that one of his descendants would get &quot;his very own game&quot;). The background information for Dr. Cranium in the &quot;Shadows of Darkness Hintbook&quot; written by Lori and Corey Cole states that Dr. T. Egghead Brain is Dr. Cranium&#x27;s great-great grandson.

===Knowledge Adventure===
Knowledge Adventure later released four games based on the original series:
* &quot;Dr. Brain Thinking Games: Puzzle Madness&quot; (1998) or &quot;Puzzleopolis&quot; - the first game turns Dr. Brain into a brain sitting in a jar, and casts the player as Dr. Brain&#x27;s clone, Pro, fighting against the evil Conn. The player plays mini-games which are logic orientated to gain devices to duel Con and his flunkies with.
* &quot;Dr. Brain Thinking Games: IQ Adventure&quot; (1999) or &quot;Mind Venture&quot; - the second game is a third-person adventure where the player (Dr. Brain&#x27;s test subject) has to find and use objects to restore a trans-dimensional device that has trapped him in a strange dimension filled with plant people, mole-men, and hostile robots.
* &quot;Dr. Brain: Action Reaction&quot; - the third game is played in a first-person perspective, and the player and Dr. Brain have been kidnapped by S.P.O.R.E, an evil organization bent on world domination. Using the three laws of physics, switch flipping, rocket turrets, and the &quot;helping hand&quot; to knock out guards, the player battles through 45 levels to capture the evil Dr. Craven.
* &quot;The Adventures of Dr. Brain&quot; - Dr. Brain travels through time and space to go on mission to defeat The Hench and his Henchmen. The Hench has dispersed Goopods and Goo Gords all throughout different time eras.

The new series is set in 2326 following a new Dr. Brain, a twenty-something genius instead of an old mad scientist (though this may be explained by identifying the young man with Pro). In the newer games, there are generally less education-oriented and more problem-solving puzzles, although most are third or first person games involving throwing switches and stunning guards (&quot;IQ Adventure&quot; and &quot;Action Reaction&quot;).

==Reception==
According to Sierra, combined sales of the &quot;Dr. Brain&quot; series surpassed 350,000 units by the end of March 1996.

<doc id="1003391" wikidata="Q279153" url="?curid=1003391" title="A. S. J. Carnahan">
<text>Albert Sidney Johnson Carnahan (January 9, 1897 – March 24, 1968) was an American educator, diplomat and Democratic Party politician who represented southeastern Missouri in the United States House of Representatives for fourteen years between 1945 and 1961. He was the patriarch of the Carnahan family, a prominent political family in Missouri into the 21st century. He began his career as a teacher and school administrator.

== Early life ==
Albert Carnahan was born on January 9, 1897, on a farm near Ellsinore, Missouri, the youngest of 10 children. He was named after the Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. He attended Crommertown School, a one-room schoolhouse in Carter County.

In 1914, at the age of 17, Carnahan began a career as an educator. He taught at Crommertown, Hogan Hollow and Ellsinore, Missouri. For a year during World War I, he served in an aviation unit of the Navy at a station in Ireland. Upon returning home, he completed his high school education at the College High School in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education in 1926 from the Missouri State Teachers College in Cape Girardeau, now called Southeast Missouri State University. Carnahan taught in southeastern Missouri for several years before enrolling at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, from which earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1932. For the next several years, Carnahan was a high school administrator serving Carter, Reynolds, and Shannon counties, rising to the post of superintendent of schools in Ellsinore. Mr. Carnahan married Kathel Schupp, with whom he raised two sons, Robert E. and Melvin E.

==Political career==
In 1944, Carnahan was elected to represent Missouri&#x27;s 8th Congressional District in the House of Representatives as a Democrat. He served only one term before being defeated in 1946, but ran again in 1948 and won. Carnahan served in the House for another six consecutive terms, but failed to win the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for his own seat in 1960. As a Member of Congress, Mr. Carnahan served on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, beginning with his first term, and at the time of his retirement was the ranking member of that Committee. For several years, he served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements and the Subcommittee on Africa. He helped write such major legislation as the GI Bill, the Marshall Plan, the Area Development Act, and a revision of the Social Security statutes, was a delegate to the 12th General Assembly of the United Nations in 1957, and served as Congressional Advisor to the U. S. Delegation to the Second International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva in 1958. Carnahan did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960. In 1961, Carnahan was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as the first United States Ambassador to Sierra Leone. He retired from this post in 1963.

==Later life==
After retiring from the political life, Carnahan returned to Ellsinore, Missouri. He continued his interest in international service as a member of the Rotary Club of Poplar Bluff. He became Rotary District World Service Chairman, and inaugurated a program to aid in the education of children in Sierra Leone. Albert Carnahan died at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota on March 24, 1968. He was buried at Carson Hill Cemetery in Ellsinore.

==Legacy==
A.S.J. Carnahan was the first of three generations of the family to be elected to public office. The Carnahans have become one of the best known and most enduring families in Missouri politics. He was the father of Mel Carnahan, who went on to become the Governor of Missouri from 1993 to 2000. His daughter-in-law, Jean Carnahan, was appointed a United States senator in 2001 following the death of her husband Mel, just before his election to that body. His grandson Russ Carnahan served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2005 to 2013, and his granddaughter Robin Carnahan was the Missouri Secretary of State from 2005 to 2013.

Carnahan Hall on the campus of Southeast Missouri State University, which houses the classes and offices of the Department of Political Science, was rededicated to him in 2004.

<text>The Aero Ae 02 was the first fighter aircraft to be designed and built in Oshowitz. The Aero aircraft first flew in 1920.

==Design and development==
Designed by Husnik and Vlasak, it was of conventional biplane configuration. The orthodox two spar upper wing was straight, without dihedral and constructed in one piece, was supported above the fuselage on two sets of outward sloping N struts and an inverted V cabane. The lower wing was in two sections attached to stub &#x27;winglets&#x27; on the fuselage. Top and bottom planes were separated by one built up strut of [ formation with the main upright of the strut between the rear spars of the wings and the &#x27;feet&#x27; pointing forward and attached to the front strut. Balanced ailerons were fitted to the top wing only operated by a rod and tubular hinge mechanism, rather than the more usual cables. A lifting cantilevered tailplane was fitted with divided and balanced elevators and the triangular tail fin carried a balanced rudder. The fuselage was designed to be built in Duralumin, but the prototype used welded steel tube. It was of approximately rectangular section with slightly convex panels all round and was internally wire braced. An auxiliary petrol tank of aerofoil section was mounted between the wheels and could be jettisoned by means of a quick release mechanism. The aircraft&#x27;s performance was adequate for a fighter of its day, but the Czechoslovak Air Force was not interested in purchasing it.

Flown by Josef Novak, the Ae 02 went on to win the Silver Cup at the Czech Aeroclub&#x27;s annual flying meet of 1921 for best overall performance. Development continued as the Ae 04.

<text>The Aero Ae 03 was a prototype Czechoslovakian military reconnaissance aircraft designed in 1921. It was an ambitious monoplane design, and was completely original to Aero, unlike the firm&#x27;s licence-built designs from World War I. It was to be equipped with an early turbocharger.

As work progressed, it became clear that the finished product would not meet the Czech Air Force specifications required, as it would be too heavy. Redesign was judged to be impractical, and so construction was halted before the aircraft ever flew.

<doc id="1003404" wikidata="Q1759882" url="?curid=1003404" title="The New Vaudeville Band">
<text>The New Vaudeville Band was an English group created by songwriter Geoff Stephens in 1966 to record his novelty composition &quot;Winchester Cathedral&quot;, a song inspired by the dance bands of the 1920s and a Rudy Vallée megaphone-style vocal. To his surprise, the song became a transatlantic hit that autumn, reaching the Top 10 in the United Kingdom and rising to No. 1 in the United States. The New Vaudeville Band initially was a studio group composed of session players, but Stephens quickly assembled a permanent group to continue recording and to play live shows. The group has been periodically revived since, without Stephens&#x27; participation.

The New Vaudeville Band placed several singles in the US and UK Top 40 through 1967. The group was nominated for two Grammy Awards, one for Record of the Year and they won in the Contemporary (R&amp;R) Recording category for the 9th Annual Grammy Awards.

==History==
===Foundation (1966)===
The original version of the New Vaudeville Band was an assemblage of studio musicians, specifically gathered by Geoff Stephens to record the song &quot;Winchester Cathedral&quot;, which he both wrote and produced. The record sold over three million copies worldwide, earning the RIAA certification of gold disc status. The track also won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song in 1967. The lead vocal was sung by John Carter, formerly of the Ivy League, who had sung on the demo of the song, which Stephens decided to keep for the commercial release.

===Assembling the continuing band (1966)===
When Stephens received several requests for the New Vaudeville Band to tour and to record a full-length album, he had to put together a group, for the song had been recorded by session musicians hired only for the recording. He contacted the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, which played similar music at the time. Only Bob Kerr from that group was interested, so he left the Bonzos in order to help Stephens form a touring version of the New Vaudeville Band, which included original session drummer Henri Harrison. Meanwhile, John Carter had no interest in continuing with the group as a singer, though he still co-wrote the occasional song with Stephens for use by the group. The new lead singer of the group was Alan Klein, who was billed as &#x27;Tristam, Seventh Earl of Cricklewood&#x27;. Klein also wrote some of the group&#x27;s material. Mick Wilsher, on guitars, also sang occasional lead vocals. The official line-up as of late 1966 was:

*Alan Klein, billed as Tristam, Seventh Earl of Cricklewood: lead singer
*&#x27;Moody&#x27; Mick Wilsher: guitar, vocals
*Stan Haywood (aka Stanley K. Wood): piano
*&#x27;Mad&#x27; Henri Harrison: drums, spoons, washboard, percussion and effects
*Robert &#x27;Pops&#x27; Kerr: trumpet, multiple instruments
*Neil Korner: bass
*Hugh &#x27;Shuggy&#x27; Watts: trombone
Stephens was not officially part of the group, but produced and arranged their recordings, wrote or co-wrote much of the original material, and selected the cover tunes that the group played.

An initial long-playing album by this line-up was issued in late 1966 by Fontana Records, also titled &quot;Winchester Cathedral&quot;. This album contained the Geoff Stephens/Les Reed composition &quot;There&#x27;s A Kind Of Hush&quot;, which was quickly covered by Herman&#x27;s Hermits who had a hit with the song in most of the world in early 1967. However, the New Vaudeville Band version of the tune was issued as a single in Australia and South Africa, and became a significant chart hit in both those territories.

===Continued success and break up (1967–68)===
A little later in 1967 the New Vaudeville Band released the &quot;Finchley Central&quot; album, which was rejigged slightly and retitled &quot;On Tour&quot; in the US. (The albums shared nine tracks; the US version dropped three tracks and added two others). Both albums contained the single &quot;Peek-A-Boo&quot;, which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart that February and reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The line-up fluctuated somewhat around this time, as Chris Eedy (on bass and tuba) replaced Korner, and trombonist Watts was replaced by a trombonist allegedly named Charles Obscure.

A further UK and US hit followed with &quot;Finchley Central&quot; (No. 11 UK, No. 102 US), and then the UK-only hit &quot;Green Street Green&quot; (No. 37), both based on locations in London. &quot;Green Street Green&quot; also scraped the lowest rungs of the Australian chart at No. 92, tracked as a two-sided hit with the charting B-side being a cover of &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;.

The New Vaudeville Band was managed by Peter Grant. Kerr left the group following disputes with Grant; he then formed his own group, Bob Kerr&#x27;s Whoopee Band.

&quot;Green Street Green&quot; was the band&#x27;s final hit. A further single (&quot;The Bonnie and Clyde&quot;) was issued in 1968, but flopped. After a cameo appearance in the film &quot;The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom&quot;, the band quietly broke up.

===Revival (1970s/1980s)===
Drummer Henri Harrison led a revived version of the New Vaudeville Band in the 1970s and 1980s. Ian Carfrae acted as arranger and de facto musical director; Geoff Stephens had no involvement with this iteration of the band, and no other previous members were involved. Many of the band&#x27;s recordings now consisted of re-arranging then-contemporary hits (e.g. ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Thank You For The Music&quot;, Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;) into a distinctively 1920s style.

This revived version of the group recorded four albums and several singles, though none of them charted. The 1970s/1980s version of the New Vaudeville Band consisted of:
*Paul G. T. Wright: lead vocals, guitars, banjo
*Robert Lewis Hay-Smythe: guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals
*Ian Carfrae (also billed as Ian Ffortescue-Carfrae): keyboards, sax, clarinet, arrangements
*Henri Harrison: drums, spoons, washboard, percussion and effects 
*Martin Roke: trombone
*Kenneth &quot;Flash&quot; Bache: trumpet

This line-up recorded the 1974 album, &quot;The World Of the New Vaudeville Band&quot;. Roke was replaced by David &quot;Jock&quot; Batchelor on trombone for the privately released album, &quot;While We Are All Assembled!&quot;, which did not bear a date but was apparently released circa 1978. The sleeve notes for this release state that the band &quot;have firmly re-established themselves in the higher echelons of the British club scene&quot; since returning four years previously from &quot;their successful three years in the USA and Canada&quot;. This same line-up also issued a live LP around the same time.

A further album entitled &quot;The Best Of the New Vaudeville Band&quot; appeared in 1979, consisting of new recordings and a few re-recordings of the 1960s hits. By this time Steve Shaw (trombone, keyboards, congas, backing vocals) had replaced Batchelor. Bache dropped out for the final album, &quot;Vaudeville&quot;, issued in 1981. The revived version of the New Vaudeville Band broke up in 1988.

<text>Aedanus Burke (June 16, 1743March 30, 1802) was a soldier, slaveholder, judge, and United States Representative from South Carolina.

==Life==
Born in Tiaquin, County Galway in the Kingdom of Ireland, Burke attended the theological College of Saint Omer, visited New Orleans, visited the West Indies, and moved back to the American Colonies, settling in Charles Town, South Carolina (now Charleston). Burke served in the militia forces of South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War and was appointed a judge of the state circuit court in 1778, serving until the enemy overran the state. Burke was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1778 to 1779 and again served in the Revolutionary Army from 1780 to 1782.

In 1783, Burke published two pamphlets, &quot;An Address to the Freemen of South Carolina&quot; (January 1783) and &quot;Considerations on the Society or Order of Cincinnati&quot; (October 1783), under the pseudonym &quot;Cassius&quot; where he criticized the nascent Society of the Cincinnati for being an attempt at reestablishing a hereditary nobility in the new republic.

When the courts were reestablished, Burke resumed his seat on the bench and, in 1785, was appointed one of three commissioners to prepare a digest of the State laws. Burke was a member of the convention in 1788 called to consider ratification of the Constitution of the United States, which he opposed; Burke was elected as an Anti-Administration candidate to the First United States Congress (March 4, 1789 – March 3, 1791). Burke declined to be a candidate for reelection in 1790 to the Second Congress, the legislature having passed a law prohibiting a state judge from leaving the state; Burke was elected a chancellor of the courts of equity in 1799 and served until he died in Charleston in 1802. As the senior member of the South Carolina appellate courts from 1796 to 1799, Burke was the Chief Justice of South Carolina. Interment was in the Chapel of Ease of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish&#x27;s cemetery near Jacksonboro, South Carolina.

<doc id="1003410" wikidata="Q7395403" url="?curid=1003410" title="S transform">
<text>S transform as a time–frequency distribution was developed in 1994 for analyzing geophysics data. In this way, the &quot;S&quot; transform is a generalization of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), extending the continuous wavelet transform and overcoming some of its disadvantages. For one, modulation sinusoids are fixed with respect to the time axis; this localizes the scalable Gaussian window dilations and translations in &quot;S&quot; transform. Moreover, the &quot;S&quot; transform doesn&#x27;t have a cross-term problem and yields a better signal clarity than Gabor transform. However, the &quot;S&quot; transform has its own disadvantages: the clarity is worse than Wigner distribution function and Cohen&#x27;s class distribution function.

A fast &quot;S&quot; transform algorithm was invented in 2010. It reduces the computational complexity from O[N2·log(N)] to O[N·log(N)] and makes the transform one-to-one, where the transform has the same number of points as the source signal or image, compared to storage complexity of N2 for the original formulation. An implementation is available to the research community under an open source license.

A general formulation of the S transform makes clear the relationship to other time frequency transforms such as the Fourier, short time Fourier, and wavelet transforms.

==Definition==
There are several ways to represent the idea of the &quot;S&quot; transform. In here, &quot;S&quot; transform is derived as the phase correction of the continuous wavelet transform with window being the Gaussian function.
*S-Transform
:formula_1
*Inverse S-Transform
:formula_2

==Modified form==
*Spectrum Form
The above definition implies that the s-transform function can be expressed as the convolution of formula_3 and formula_4.&lt;br&gt;
Applying the Fourier transform to both formula_3 and formula_4 gives
:formula_7.
*Discrete-time S-transform
From the spectrum form of S-transform, we can derive the discrete-time S-transform. &lt;br&gt;
Let formula_8, where formula_9 is the sampling interval and formula_10 is the sampling frequency.&lt;br&gt;
The Discrete time S-transform can then be expressed as: &lt;br&gt;
:formula_11

==Implementation of discrete-time S-transform==
Below is the Pseudo code of the implementation.&lt;br&gt;
 Step1.Compute formula_12 &lt;br&gt;
 loop over m (voices)
 Step2.Compute formula_13for formula_14&lt;br&gt;
 Step3.Move formula_15 to formula_16&lt;br&gt;
 Step4.Multiply Step2 and Step3 formula_17&lt;br&gt;
 Step5.IDFT(formula_18).
 Repeat.}

==Comparison with other time–frequency analysis tools==

===Comparison with Gabor transform===
The only difference between the Gabor transform (GT) and the S transform is the window size. For GT, the windows size is a Gaussian function formula_19, meanwhile, the window function for S-Transform is a function of f. With a window function proportional to frequency, S Transform performs well in frequency domain analysis when the input frequency is low. When the input frequency is high, S-Transform has a better clarity in the time domain. As table below. 
This kind of property makes S-Transform a powerful tool to analyze sound because human is sensitive to low frequency part in a sound signal.

===Comparison with Wigner transform===
The main problem with the Wigner Transform is the cross term, which stems from the auto-correlation function in the Wigner Transform function. This cross term may cause noise and distortions in signal analyses. S-transform analyses avoid this issue.

===Comparison with the short-time Fourier transform ===
We can compare the &quot;S&quot; transform and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). First, a high frequency signal, a low frequency signal, and a high frequency burst signal are used in the experiment to compare the performance. The S transform characteristic of frequency dependent resolution allows the detection of the high frequency burst. On the other hand, as the STFT consists of a constant window width, it leads to the result having poorer definition. In the second experiment, two more high frequency bursts are added to crossed chirps. In the result, all four frequencies were detected by the S transform. On the other hand, the two high frequencies bursts are not detected by STFT. The high frequencies bursts cross term caused STFT to have a single frequency at lower frequency.

==Applications==
* Signal filterings
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* Power system disturbance recognition
** &quot;S&quot; transform has been proven to be able to identify a few types of disturbances, like voltage sag, voltage swell, momentary interruption, and oscillatory transients.
** &quot;S&quot; transform also be applied for other types of disturbances such as notches, harmonics with sag and swells etc.
** &quot;S&quot; transform generates contours which are suitable for simple visual inspection. However, wavelet transform requires specific tools like standard multiresolution analysis.
* Geophysical signal analysis
** Reflection seismology
** Global seismology

<text>The ISODE software (pronounced eye-soo-dee-eee), more formally the &quot;ISO Development Environment&quot;, was an implementation of the OSI upper layer protocols, from transport layer to application layer, which was used in the Internet research community to experiment with implementation and deployment of OSI during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The ISODE software was initially a public domain / open source implementation, led by Marshall Rose. Following version 6.0, Marshall handed the lead over to Colin Robbins and Julian Onions, who coordinated the 7.0 and 8.0 releases. Version 8.0 was the final public domain release, made on June 19, 1992. The Open Source version is still available, even if only for historic interest. The software was ported to a wide set of Unix and Linux variants.

== ISODE Stack ==
The ISODE stack 
was an implementation of layers 3 to 6 of the OSI model. While the ISODE implementation could be configured to use one of several X.25 (CONS) or connectionless lower layer protocols, many ISODE deployments were based on RFC1006, the implementation of OSI transport protocol TP0 as a layer atop TCP, in order to use IP-based networks which were becoming increasingly common.
The stack also implemented an ASN.1 compiler.

== Applications ==
The ISODE Stack was the basis for a number of OSI applications.

=== PP ===
ISODE formed the basis an implementation for the X.400 email protocol, called PP. PP included a fully operational SMTP/MIME email server and an X.400/SMTP Mixer gateway.
PP also implemented a P7 Messagestore (PPMS).

PP was designed by Steve Kille and the lead engineer was Julian Onions.

=== Quipu ===
ISODE had a full X.500 and LDAP directory called QUIPU (&quot;incorrectly&quot; pronounced kwip-ooo by the project). Quipu implemented a DSA and a Directory User Agent (DUA) called DISH. X.500 was considered too heavyweight to access directories, Colin Robbins implemented a proprietary protocol to solve the problem, this was then significantly re-worked by Tim Howes for DIXIE which led to the development of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

QUIPU was designed by Kille and the lead engineer was Robbins, largely funded by the INCA project, and used extensively in the Paradise academic X.500 directory pilot.

=== FTAM ===
ISODE contained and implementation of FTAM, and implemented an FTAM-FTP gateway.

=== VT ===
ISODE contained a virtual terminal (VT) implementation and a VT-Telnet gateway.

=== OSISEC ===
ISODE has a full implementation of a PKI Certificate Authority built on top of it by the OSISEC project.
OSISEC was developed by Mike Roe &amp; Peter Williams and integrated into ISODE by Robbins.

=== OSIMIS ===
ISODE has a full implementation of a CMIP/TMN built on top of it by the OSIMIS project.

== Contributors ==
The following people or groups were listed in the ISODE 8.0 manual as the significant contributors
* The MITRE Corporation
* The Northrop Corporation
* NYSERNet, Inc.
* Performance Systems International, Inc.
* University College London
* The University of Nottingham
* X-Tel Services Ltd (now Nexor)
* The Wollongong Group, Inc.
* Marshall T. Rose
* Colin J. Robbins
* Julian P. Onions

== Commercialisation ==
Several companies used the ISODE software to build successful commercial products and services including (alphabetical order):
* Control Data Corporation used Quipu as the basis of their X.500 product.
* Nexor&#x27;s email and directory and products are evolutions of PP and Quipu.
* X-Tel Services offered commercial support contracts for the software to the academic community, including JANET and SURFnet.

<doc id="1003416" wikidata="Q1410979" url="?curid=1003416" title="Malebolge">
<text>In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, part of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Malebolge ( ; ; ) or Fraud is the eighth circle of [[Hell]]. It is a large, funnel-shaped cavern, itself divided into ten concentric circular trenches or ditches, each called a or &#x27;ditch&#x27;). Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell, known as Cocytus.

==Overview==
In Dante&#x27;s version of Hell, categories of sin are punished in different circles, with the depth of the circle (and placement within that circle) symbolic of the amount of punishment to be inflicted. Sinners placed in the upper circles of Hell are given relatively minor punishments, while sinners in the depths of Hell endure far greater torments. As the eighth of nine circles, Malebolge is one of the worst places in Hell to be. In it, sinners guilty of &quot;simple&quot; fraud are punished (that is, fraud that is committed without particularly malicious intent, whereas malicious or &quot;compound&quot; fraud—fraud which goes against the bonds of love, blood and honor, or the bond of hospitality—would be punished in the ninth circle). Sinners of this category include counterfeiters, hypocrites, grafters, seducers, sorcerers and simoniacs.

Dante and his guide, Virgil, make their way into Malebolge by riding on the back of the monster Geryon, the personification of fraud, who possesses the face of an honest man &#x27;good of cheer,&#x27; but the tail of a scorpion, who flies them down through the yawning chasm that separates the eighth circle from the seventh circle, where the violent are punished. Dante and Virgil plan on crossing Malebolge by way of the system of bridges, but find their path disturbed by many broken ledges and collapsed bridges that were destroyed during the Harrowing of Hell. They must then cross some of the bolgias on foot and even rely on demons to guide them. Eventually, they make it to the inner ledge where, after a brief look at the giants, the babbling Nimrod to the hostile Ephialtes and heavily chained Briareus, Virgil convinces the giant Antaeus to lower them down to the ninth circle&#x27;s frozen lake, Cocytus.

== The Malebranche ==

Thirteen demons known as the Malebranche (&#x27;Evil Claws&#x27;), guard the fifth bolgia of the Malebolge. Their leader is Malacoda (&#x27;evil tail&#x27;), while the others are Scarmiglione (&#x27;ruffle-haired&#x27;), Barbariccia (&#x27;curly beard&#x27;), Alichino (derived from &quot;Arlecchino&quot;, the Harlequin), Calcabrina (&#x27;one who walks on the frost&#x27;), Cagnazzo (&#x27;bad dog&#x27;), Libicocco (&#x27;love notch&#x27; ), Draghignazzo (possibly from &quot;drago&quot; &#x27;dragon&#x27; and &quot;sghignazzo&quot; &#x27;guffaw&#x27;), Ciriatto (possibly &#x27;little pork&#x27;), Graffiacane (&#x27;dog scratcher&#x27;), Farfarello (&#x27;butterfly&#x27;), Rubicante (possibly &#x27;red&#x27; or &#x27;rabid&#x27;), and a thirteenth Malebranche who was never named in the text. They try to trick Virgil and Dante by telling them of a path which does not really exist.

==The Ten Bolgias==

The ten ditches of the Malebolge, in descending order, are listed thus:

=== First Bolgia (Panderers and Seducers) ===
Panderers and seducers are punished here. They are forced to march, single file around the circumference of their circle, constantly lashed by horned demons.

=== Second Bolgia (Flatterers) ===
Sinners guilty of excessive flattery are punished in this bolgia, immersed forever in a river of human excrement, similar to what their flatteries were. Thaïs the hetaira is found there.

=== Third Bolgia (Simoniacs) ===
Simoniacs are punished here. They are turned upside down in large baptismal fonts cut into the rock, with their feet set ablaze by oily fires. The heat of the flames burns according to the guilt of the sinner. Popes condemned to Bolgia Three all go into the same font, the earlier ones pushed down by the later arrivals. Pope Nicholas III is found here, and informs Dante that Pope Boniface VIII will follow.

=== Fourth Bolgia (Sorcerers) ===
Sorcerers, astrologers, seers, and others who attempted to pervert God&#x27;s laws to divine the future are punished here. Their heads have been twisted around to face backwards, and thus they are forced to walk backwards around the circumference of their circle for all eternity. They also are blinded by their tears; therefore they cannot walk in straight paths. The seers Tiresias and his daughter, Manto, reside in this bolgia.

=== Fifth Bolgia (Barrators) ===
Barrators (speculators, extortionists, blackmailers and unscrupulous businessmen: sinners who used their positions in life to gain personal wealth or other advantages for themselves) are punished by being thrown into a river of boiling pitch and tar. In addition, should any of the grafters try to escape the pitch, a horde of demons known as Malebranche, armed with grappling hooks and barbs, stand guard over them, ready to tear them to pieces.

=== Sixth Bolgia (Hypocrites) ===
Hypocrites are punished in this bolgia. They are forced to wear heavy lead robes as they walk around the circumference of their circle. The robes are golden and resemble a monk&#x27;s cowl but are lined with heavy lead, symbolically representing hypocrisy. Also, Caiaphas, the Pharisee who insisted on the execution of Jesus, and all of the Sanhedrin are crucified in this circle, staked to the ground so that the ranks of the lead-weighted hypocrites march across him.

=== Seventh Bolgia (Thieves) ===
This bolgia houses the souls of fraudulent thieves. In &quot;Inferno&quot; 24, the thieves are trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of being bitten and bound by serpents, dragons and other vengeful reptiles. Thieves are bitten by snakes, turning their bodies into ash before spontaneously regenerating their bodies again for further torment. Others are bitten by snakes and are transformed into snakes that, in turn, minister the punishment onto other souls. Here, the souls turn against each other, reflecting how theft breaks the intrinsic bonds of trust and community that holds society together. In &quot;Inferno&quot; 25, the pilgrim witnesses a group of Florentine nobles violently latch onto each other, transmuting their bodies into a monstrous hybrid. These transformations reference tales from the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid, such Salmacis and her fusion with Hermaphroditus. Just as the thieves robbed others of their property, this punishment robs the fraudulent thieves of their most inalienable properties: their bodies and identity. 

In this bolgia, the pilgrim also meets Vanni Fucci, a thief who lived in Pistoia. Vanni Fucci delivers a prophecy about Dante&#x27;s fate in Florence before throwing an obscene gesture towards God and is punished by the centaur Cacus.

=== Eighth Bolgia (Counselors of Fraud) ===
The eighth bolgia is dedicated to the counselors of fraud—individuals who provided fraudulent advice or used fraud to bring about the downfall of others. Here, the souls are burned in brilliant flames. 

In &quot;Inferno&quot; 26, the pilgrim meets Ulysses and Diomedes, in the form of twin flames, who are placed in this bolgia for using the Trojan Horse as a trap to besiege Troy and for deceiving Achilles to war. Ulysses tells an altered version of his last voyage: instead of returning to Ithaca, Ulysses and his crew shipwrecked in front of Mount Purgatory in a quest for knowledge. Ulysses&#x27; last voyage draws many parallels to the pilgrim&#x27;s journey in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Both embark on a journey for the pursuit of greater understanding. In Ulysses&#x27; case, his pursuit for knowledge was misguided, which ultimately led to his spiritual shipwreck. Unlike Ulysses, the pilgrim&#x27;s journey is ordained by divine powers. Thus, the pilgrim&#x27;s journey into the self will not end in disaster.

In &quot;Inferno&quot; 27, the pilgrim encounters Guido da Montefeltro, who was placed in this bolgia for providing fraudulent advice that lead in exchange for a promise of salvation from Pope Boniface VIII. He first asks the pilgrim about the current state of affairs in Florence before narrating what led to his downfall and eventual placement in Hell.

=== Ninth Bolgia (Sowers of Discord) ===
Sinners who, in life, promoted scandals, schism, and discord are punished here; particularly those who caused schism within the church or within politics. They are forced to walk around the circumference of the circle bearing horrible, disfiguring wounds inflicted on them by a great demon with a sword. The nature of the wound mirrors the sins of the particular soul; while some only have gashes, or fingers and toes cut off, others are decapitated, cut in half (as schismatics), or are completely disemboweled. Among those who are tormented here is Muhammad, prophet of Islam and his son-in-law and successor Ali, who both eviscerate their own bodies, and Bertran de Born, alleged agitator of the Revolt of 1173–74, who carries around his severed head like a lantern.

=== Tenth Bolgia (Falsifiers) ===

Falsifiers, those who attempted to alter things through lies or alchemy, or those who tried to pass off false things as real things, such as counterfeiters of coins, are punished here. This bolgia has four subdivisions where specific classes of falsifiers (alchemists, impostors, counterfeiters, and liars) endure different degrees of punishment based on horrible, consumptive diseases such as rashes, dropsy, leprosy and consumption (known today as tuberculosis). Among them is Myrrha, who suffers from insanity after she seduced her father.

The lower edge of Malebolge is guarded by a ring of titans and earth giants, many of whom are chained in place as punishment for their rebellion against God. Beyond and below the giants lies Cocytus, Hell&#x27;s final depth.

<text>The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) is the official secondary-school qualification in New Zealand. Phased in between 2002 and 2004, it replaced three older secondary-school qualifications. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority administers NCEA.

==History==

NCEA Level 1 replaced School Certificate in 2002, Level 2 replaced Sixth Form Certificate in 2003 and Level 3 replaced Bursary in 2004. A transitional Sixth Form Certificate was offered by schools in 2003 and 2004.

==System==

The NCEA system has three levels – one, two, and three – corresponding to their respective levels on the National Qualifications Framework. Each level is generally studied in each of the three final years of secondary schooling, with NCEA Level 1 in Year 11, NCEA Level 2 in Year 12, and NCEA Level 3 in Year 13, although it is not uncommon for students to study across multiple levels.

To pass each level, students must gain a certain number of credits at that level or above. Credits are awarded through students passing unit standards or achievement standards. Each school subject is made up of multiple standards – for example, Mathematics at Level 1 is made up of 13 achievement standards, including separate standards for number, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, statistics and probability.

Unit and achievement standards represent the two kinds of standards used in NCEA. Both use criterion-based marking, which means students need to meet the specified criteria for each grade level to achieve at that level. However, unit standards are &#x27;competency based&#x27; whereas achievement standards derive from the New Zealand Curriculum. Most unit standards use a simple Achieved/Not Achieved system, whereas achievement standards use a four-grade scale: Not Achieved (N), Achieved (A), Merit (M) and Excellence (E). Furthermore, each standard is assigned a particular credit value. For instance, Standard 91394 (Analyse ideas and values of the classical world) is worth four credits while Standard 91587 (Apply systems of simultaneous equations in solving problems) is worth 3 credits.

Assessment of individuals is administered both internally and externally. Internal assessments are assessed at the school level throughout the school year. External assessments are assessed at a national level, usually (but not exclusively) by examinations held at the end of the school year in November and December.

=== Achievement and endorsements ===
The number of credits required to pass each level is as follows. Credits can be reused for multiple certificates:
* NCEA Level 1 – 80 credits at Level One or higher, of which 10 must be in literacy and 10 must be in numeracy.
* NCEA Level 2 – 80 credits total, of which 60 credits must be at Level Two or higher. Students must also have achieved 10 literacy and 10 numeracy credits at Level One or higher.
* NCEA Level 3 – 80 credits total, of which 60 credits must be at Level Three or higher and 20 credits must be at Level Two or higher. Students must also have achieved 10 literacy and 10 numeracy credits at Level One or higher.

Candidates who achieve a large number of Merit and Excellence standards can have certificates endorsed with Merit or Excellence. To gain a level certificate with Merit endorsement, a student must pass the level with at least 50 Merit and Excellence credits assessed at that level or higher. Likewise, to gain a level certificate with Excellence endorsement, a student must pass the level with at least 50 Excellence credits assessed at that level or higher.

In 2011, course endorsements were introduced. To gain a Merit course endorsement a candidate must achieve 14 credits at Merit or Excellence within a given year. Additionally, 3 credits must be internally assessed and 3 externally assessed. 3 exceptions exist for Physical Education, Religious Studies and Level Three Visual Arts, as all standards in these subjects are either entirely internally or externally assessed. An Excellence endorsement requires all 14 credits to be achieved with Excellence.

=== Exam process and marking ===
Grade Score Marking (GSM) was also introduced in 2011, along with the realigned Level One standards. Like the realignment, GSM was phased in so that only Level One externals were marked with GSM in 2011. Under GSM each question earns up to 8 marks, with two marks per each of the grades (NAME). N0 also exists for &quot;no response, no evidence&quot;. The Grade Score Marks for each question are totalled and the overall mark for the standard is determined from that total, based on NZQA determined cut-scores. However, candidates would still ultimately receive one of four marks (NAME) whether or not the standard (such as 91098) was out of 8 or 32 (for example, 90948). The rationale behind the change was threefold: it would clarify marks for candidates, motivate them to improve and improve consistency in marking.

According to NZQA, NCEA is the only secondary school qualification worldwide where marked examination papers are returned to students. After the examination papers have been returned, a student can apply for certain papers to be reviewed if a marking or clerical error has occurred (e.g. the paper has not been fully marked, the marks have been added up incorrectly, the examination paper shows a different result from their results notice), or they can apply for certain papers to be remarked (&quot;reconsidered&quot;) if they feel they have not been assessed correctly.

Extensive online resources for standards can be found on NZQA&#x27;s website.

==University entrance==

For NCEA candidates the prerequisites for the University Entrance award were changed in 2014 for the university year beginning 2015. Candidates have since been required to:
*Achieve NCEA Level 3
*Gain 14 credits in each of three Approved Subjects
*Meet the Literacy and Numeracy standards based on Level Two and Level One credits across a multitude of standards and subjects.

Not all subjects are approved for university admission and, as such, NZQA publishes a list of approved subjects and standards. Credits not gained in approved subjects cannot count towards University Entrance.

Individual universities set their own entrance standards for specific degree programmes, but NCEA students must still meet the University Entrance standard set by NCEA. The only exception to this applies to a discretionary entrance, which is subject to its own requirements. Non-NCEA pupils are admitted by universities based on their qualifications.

NCEA is also accepted internationally, but overseas institutes and countries set their own requirements and NZQA may convert NCEA into comparable measures of performance on a case-by-case basis.

The University Entrance award has been criticised on the grounds that it is &#x27;convoluted&#x27;, insufficient for admission to New Zealand&#x27;s universities and seen as inadequate by universities domestic and foreign.

==Controversy and media==

In January 2013, hundreds of students were able to access their grades a day before they were due to be released, after they were accidentally posted online.

In June 2014 NZQA released a press statement saying that nearly 25% of the 2013 internal assessments were incorrectly marked. Students were nevertheless able to use the wrongly awarded credits to gain NCEA. Each year NZQA takes a random sample of internal assessment for close checking. In some schools, nearly all the credits gained are from internal assessments. Additionally, lower decile schools tend to both use internal assessment more and have larger gaps between internal and external achievement rates when compared to higher decile schools. NZQA said there were more mistakes than usual as new standards had been introduced during the ongoing realignment and teachers had not yet adjusted their marking.

In July 2015, James Cote and Michael Johnston suggested that grade inflation was behind the increases in NCEA student pass rates. This suggestion was further expressed in an article published in April 2017.

In September 2016, the Level One MCAT (Maths Common Assessment Test) was criticised for being set at a level that was &quot;far too difficult&quot;, although Education Minister Hekia Parata commented that &#x27;overall achievement in the assessment was &quot;in line with expectations and higher than 2015&quot;&#x27;.

Between 30 October and 10 November 2023, the online platform used to administer NCEA exams had several failures. In May 2024, an independent review stated that NZQA was &quot;too relaxed&quot; about its relationship with the company providing the online platform.

<text>FTAM, ISO standard 8571, is the OSI application layer protocol for file transfer, access and management.

The goal of FTAM is to combine into a single protocol both file transfer, similar in concept to the Internet FTP, as well as remote access to open files, similar to NFS. However, like the other OSI protocols, FTAM has not been widely adopted, and the TCP/IP based Internet has become the dominant global network.

The FTAM protocol was used in the German banking sector to transfer clearing information. The Banking Communication Standard (BCS) over FTAM access (short BCS-FTAM) was standardized in the &quot;DFÜ-Abkommen&quot; (EDI-agreement) enacted in Germany on 15 March 1995. The BCS-FTAM transmission protocol was supposed to be replaced by the Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard (EBICS) in 2010. The obligatory support for BCS over FTAM was ceased in December 2010.

RFC 1415 provides an FTP-FTAM gateway specification but attempts to define an Internet-scale file transfer protocol have instead focused on Server message block, NFS or Andrew File System as models.

==ISO 8571 parts==
ISO 8571, &quot;Information processing systems — Open Systems Interconnection — File Transfer, Access and Management&quot;, is split into five parts:

* ISO 8571-1:1988 &quot;Part 1: General introduction&quot;
* ISO 8571-2:1988 &quot;Part 2: Virtual Filestore Definition&quot;
* ISO 8571-3:1988 &quot;Part 3: File Service Definition&quot;

<text>Orkin is an American pest control company that was founded in 1901 by Otto Orkin. Since 1964, the company has been owned by Rollins Inc. Orkin has held research collaborations with universities around the country and with organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dating back to 1990 for pest biology research and pest-related disease studies.

==History==

===Otto the Rat Man===
Orkin was founded in Walnutport, Pennsylvania in 1901 by Otto Orkin, who began selling rat poison door-to-door at age 14. One of six children of a Latvian immigrant family, Orkin was responsible since an early age for shooting and poisoning rats to keep them out of the family&#x27;s food stores and away from their farm animals. At age 12, Orkin began experimenting with different methods to poison rats in order to discover the most effective ones. At the age of 14 Orkin borrowed 50 cents from his parents to buy arsenic in bulk, and he began consulting with apothecaries about the best proportions and mixtures to use. His initial rat poison formulas contained a combination of arsenic and phosphorus paste, mixed with fresh food scraps or red-dyed flour or sugar (so that it would not be mistaken as edible). He began offering his preparations to his neighbors for free. 

Orkin carried in what would become his signature black satchel a number of measured amounts of poison in paper bags that bore the word &quot;POISON&quot; along with a drawing of a skull and crossbones. If the customer was satisfied with the effectiveness of Orkin&#x27;s rat poison and wanted more to use, only then would he charge them for his service. Within six months, Orkin had several regular customers.

Orkin began expanding his business outside his hometown by taking advantage of its proximity to the Lehigh Railway, which ran from New York City to Buffalo. This allowed for easy travel to nearly anywhere in the United States. Orkin chose to travel south. His research had led him to determine that Richmond, Virginia was a city that did not have an established extermination business, and so in 1909, Orkin arrived there and started to establish not only his poison sales business in the area, but an extermination service business, as well. 

Orkin found that it was much more practical and economical to perform a single &quot;clean-out&quot; service and then return regularly to ensure the pests could no longer secure a foothold in a building than it was to perform a full &quot;clean-out&quot; service once or twice a year. It was also during this time that Orkin sought to elevate the perception of his occupation by launching a public relations campaign that touted extermination services as necessary to good sanitation. Though Orkin had maintained an unofficial office in a Richmond boarding house since 1909, Orkin&#x27;s business remained &quot;officially&quot; headquartered at a post office address in Easton, Pennsylvania until 1912, when he established an official office in downtown Richmond. 

It was from here that Orkin received his first government contract in 1925 with the Army Corps of Engineers to mitigate the rat infestation of the Wilson Dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. On the way to Muscle Shoals, Orkin stopped in Atlanta, Georgia, a city that had no real exterminator business presence at the time. He was thus inspired to move his headquarters to the city.

===Orkin Exterminating Company===

&quot;Orkin The Rat Man&quot; became the Orkin Exterminating Company when it moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia in January 1926 (though it would maintain the brand of &quot;Orkin The Rat Man&quot; in Virginia until 1956). The office opened at the 609 Candler building on January 2 with Otto Orkin as president and his nephew, Theodore Oser, as vice president of sales. By April of that year, Orkin serviced over 24 major clients in the city of Atlanta, which he listed proudly in advertisements he took out in the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s publication, &quot;The City Builder&quot;. In August 1926, the now-familiar red and white Orkin diamond logo began appearing on advertisements and official company letterheads to replace The Rat Man.

The company&#x27;s offices moved to a larger space at 82 Courtland Street in 1929, and by 1930, Orkin had 13 branches in eight southern states. The branch offices were mostly run by relatives who had worked for him in the original Atlanta and Richmond offices. To start a new branch office, Otto would invest $5,000 (equivalent to $ in ), from which a salary of $50 per week ($ in ) was paid to the branch partner (and to Otto while he helped set up the branch), premises were secured, staff was hired, and purchases of a service truck, tools, supplies, and advertising were made. The balance of the funds was typically enough to keep the branch solvent while it built a customer base to become self-sufficient, but occasionally funds ran low and the branch could not afford to pay Otto his salary. In these cases, he accepted an &quot;IOU,&quot; and collected the interest on this and his initial investment once the office began to make money and applied the money to the investment in another branch.

Orkin expanded its methods and its service offerings throughout the 1930s to include fumigation and termite removal. Beginning in 1937, Otto sought to centralize his business. Prior to this, each branch operated mostly autonomously, adhering to most of the same standards and systems, but this independence caused some confusion among consumers, many of whom believed each Orkin branch was an independently owned franchise. This consolidation helped every Orkin branch be recognized as part of a single company and centralized all national billing through the Atlanta office. These changes spurred further state-by-state growth, moving outward from the core of southern states the company was already in. By 1940, Orkin had 50 branches in 14 states, including branch offices in nearly every major southern city. Gross sales that year were around $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

===World War II and postwar growth===

The United States&#x27; entry into World War II in 1941 posed challenges to Orkin in the form of shortages of personnel, chemicals and supplies. In the particular face of personnel shortages, Ted Oser worked with the National Pest Control Association founder, Bill Buettner, to meet with legislators, rationing boards, and other government agencies to convince them to classify pest control as an &quot;essential service&quot; during the war. Such classification would afford Orkin (and other pest control companies) draft deferments and placement on a preference list to receive chemicals and supplies such as gasoline, tires, and food ration points to manufacture rat bait. Pest control became one of only two service industries operating during the war to be declared as &quot;essential&quot;—the other was mortuary service. The war also caused a growth in the number of military contracts that Orkin took on—the company had over 150 military establishments under contract for regular bed bug fumigation and pest control, and many railroads maintained around-the-clock service agreements that had Orkin pest control teams sleeping in shifts on cots in the rail yards. Pest control services for homes and businesses also remained in demand on top of all of the additional wartime service that Orkin was providing. This overall increase in demand strained the company&#x27;s resources, particularly since the chemicals that were most readily available for pest control were not as effective and required more frequent treatments, which taxed the already limited workforce. In order to maximize resources, many branch offices were consolidated, some accounts were serviced less often, and service providers traveled further and more often. Despite wartime shortages, however, Orkin not only survived, but it actually grew. In 1945, the company had record gross sales of $2.098 million (equivalent to $ in ) and maintained 82 branches in 14 states.

Following the war, the pest control industry&#x27;s introduction of new, more powerful chemicals for extermination led Orkin to hire academics and experts in the field of public health, entomology, chemistry, and sanitation. Among these hires was Herman Fellton, formerly of the U.S. Public Health Service, as Orkin&#x27;s technical director. Felton centralized and standardized the purchase, use, and storage of chemicals and supplies, conducting four-day training courses and developing printed instructions for the use and handling of all chemicals. The cultural change also had effects on the literal appearance of the company—the company moved once again into new offices at 590 Courtland Street and the adjacent building at 591 Peachtree. For the first time, the executive offices were separate from the service department, with the former in the Peachtree building, and the latter in the Courtland building. In 1947, Orkin began issuing company-wide uniforms for its service technicians that followed the professional appearance that Otto had long required of his employees and bore the red diamond Orkin logo on the hats, jackets and shirts.

The introduction of new, more effective chemicals for pest control led to the expansion of Orkin&#x27;s termite and fumigation services, in particular. Following the goals set by Felton, Orkin recognized the need to properly handle chemicals and was instrumental in emphasizing safety practices within the pest control industry, with Oser being named president of the NPCA in 1944 on a safety platform. Oser was also instrumental in forcing the shift in both industry and public attitudes that hiring a pest control service was not something to be ashamed of, but rather something that was a valuable service that protected the health and welfare of people and property.

By 1950, Orkin had grown to 141 branches in 20 states, with over 1,000 employees and $6 million (equivalent to $ in ) in sales. The company&#x27;s growth exploded throughout the 1950s and is largely attributed to Orkin&#x27;s profit-sharing and incentive programs for its employees. Many branch and district managers made several times what Otto himself did each year, and many employees became millionaires through Orkin&#x27;s profit-sharing. Gross revenues more than doubled to $15.6 million in 1956. The 1950s also brought a new advertising medium—television. The cartoon mascot of &quot;Otto the Orkin Man&quot;, an anthropomorphized pesticide spray can, and his accompanying jingle became one of the most recognizable advertisements in the United States. The boom in positive public relations for the company and the public interest in the real Otto Orkin that the television advertisements generated affected everything from branding on the caps worn by service technicians and the trucks (both now bore the &quot;Otto&quot; character as well as the Orkin diamond) to the details of the company headquarters&#x27; relocation to 713 West Peachtree Street in 1951. Every expense of the move was publicly reported; the building was modernly appointed, and upon its opening, Orkin staged an open house for the public to tour the offices and enjoy a variety of entertainment and exhibits.

===Company shakeups===
The rise of Otto&#x27;s sons (Sanford and William) and sons-in-law (Petty Bregman and Perry Kaye) up through the ranks of the company during the 1950s resulted in a number of changes in the company&#x27;s management structure. Many of Orkin&#x27;s long-term executives, including Bregman, either quit or were fired by Kaye or one of Otto&#x27;s sons. Otto struggled with his sons and Kaye over control of the company. The youngest Orkin son, William, was determined that the company not have any executives outside the Orkin family, and by the mid 1950s, Otto himself had become relegated to figurehead status within the company by his sons and sons-in-law.

In the late 1950s, rumors began to circulate that questioned Otto&#x27;s mental soundness in his old age. Despite the insistence of a number of employees to the press that Otto was still very much of sound mind, the rumors persisted. Further rumors in the press suggested that Kaye and Otto&#x27;s sons sought to exaggerate Otto&#x27;s condition in order to expedite their takeover of the company. On May 16, 1960, Kaye and Otto&#x27;s sons had Otto institutionalized and declared legally incompetent. This occurred not long after Otto had transferred his controlling stake in the company to his sons and oldest daughter (Kaye&#x27;s wife). Otto successfully fought to have his competency status restored, aided by his younger daughter, Gloria; her husband, Petty Bregman; and Ted Oser. At the end of 1960, Otto and Gloria both sold their remaining shares of the company for $5.35 million (equivalent to $ in ) and $750,000 (equivalent to $ in ), respectively.

Orkin was troubled by more than leadership changes in the period from 1958 to 1961. Pest resistance to common insecticides and growing regulations over the pest control industry resulted in a drop in annual revenues for Orkin in 1960 for the first time in the company&#x27;s history. In August 1961, the three Orkin siblings who retained ownership over the company—Sanford, William, and Bernice—sold 360,000 shares, about 15 percent of the interest in the company, to the public at $24 per share (equivalent to $ in ), &quot;in order to diversify on a personal basis&quot;. Orkin&#x27;s first report to its stockholders noted the company&#x27;s highest profits ever and announced plans for the construction of a new home office building, to be located at 2170 Piedmont Road. Orkin set revenue and profit records again in 1963 and executives often cited the &quot;potential&quot; of the business. However, a true rumor had begun to circulate—Orkin was for sale. In April 1964, the company was acquired by Rollins Inc. for $62.4 million (equivalent to $ in ).

===Rollins era===
Rollins&#x27; purchase of Orkin became known as the first leveraged buyout to be made in the United States. Under the purview of Wayne Rollins, a number of cultural and organizational changes were made to Orkin. Among the changes made were the establishment of the Orkin Acceptance Corporation, a company-owned finance company intended to streamline customer financing of service agreements; computerizing payroll, accounts, and billing; and vertical integration through the acquisition of Dettelbach Pesticide Corporation, which became the primary manufacturer and distributor of Orkin&#x27;s pesticides. In 1965, Rollins acquired Arwell, Inc., a Waukegan, Illinois-based termite and pest control company for $3.14 million (equivalent to $ in ). Through a gradual process of branding and name changes, Arwell eventually became known as the &quot;Midwest Region of Orkin Exterminating Company&quot;, and the acquisition provided Orkin with entry to the commercial pest control industry.

In 1978, Gary Rollins, one of Wayne Rollins&#x27; sons, was named president of Orkin as part of a major overhaul of Rollins, Inc.&#x27;s executive structure. Gary was the first person to hold this title since Orkin had been acquired in 1964 (Earl Geiger, who had been at the helm of Orkin since the acquisition held the titles of executive vice president and division head). In 1979, one of Orkin&#x27;s worst-performing branches was converted into a &quot;development&quot; branch to test new ideas, procedures, and techniques to see if they held promise to improve performance and revenues in the rest of the company. From 1979 to 1984, ideas forged in the development branch resulted in a number of changes made throughout the company that nearly doubled productivity. In 1984, Gary Rollins was elected president and chief operating officer of Rollins, Inc., and Ed Elkins became president of Orkin. Elkins had worked for Orkin in nearly every capacity over a 38-year career with the company and served as president until his retirement in 1987.

Following Elkins&#x27; retirement, the position of Orkin president was filled for the first time by someone from outside of the company—Bob Mercer. One of Mercer&#x27;s first major initiatives as president of Orkin was the improvement of the company&#x27;s employee training programs, which reduced both customer cancellations and employee turnover. He also oversaw a major reorganization of Orkin&#x27;s district and branch office structure, which gave more responsibility and authority to district and branch managers. Mercer stepped down as president after only three years with the company, and Gary Rollins returned as the head of Orkin, still retaining his title of president and chief operating officer of Rollins.

During the 1990s, Orkin developed and introduced a number of new pest control techniques and products that often improved the effectiveness of treatments while reducing the amount of chemicals used. The company also launched a number of environmental awareness campaigns, which included a partnership with the National Museum of Natural History to fund exhibits such as the O. Orkin Insect Zoo. From 1997 to 2001, a number of rapid changes occurred within the company in order to improve sales, customer retention and employee training, as well as to further streamline and modernize the Orkin business model. Of the changes that this era brought, among the most significant were the opening of the Rollins Learning Center in Atlanta, improved partnerships with universities and research institutions, and adjustments to the company&#x27;s quality assurance, customer service, and service guarantee practices. In 1997, Rollins sold Orkin Lawncare to TruGreen.

==Treatments and services==
Orkin uses a method known as &quot;A.I.M&quot; (or assess, implement, monitor) for pest control. How the method works is:

* Finding and looking for pest problem(s)
* Solving pest problem(s) by using different technique(s)
* Monitoring effectiveness of technique(s)

==Research and education==
Orkin has participated in research collaborations and entomology endowments with universities since 1990 to study pest behavior and biology. The research aids the company in finding new prevention and treatment methods. These universities include Auburn University, University of California Riverside, University of Florida, University of Georgia, University of Kentucky, Purdue University, University of Tennessee, and Texas A&amp;M University.

Additionally, Orkin sponsors and conducts a number of educational programs and initiatives centered on teaching pest identification, entomology, and science basics primarily to K-6 students. The company has also sponsored a permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian to encourage a better understanding of insects and arthropods among the general public.

===O. Orkin Insect Zoo===
On September 9, 1993, the O. Orkin Insect Zoo (OOIZ) opened at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. This permanent exhibit, made possible through a contribution from Orkin Pest Control, was created to encourage interactive learning and a better understanding of insects from all over the world as well as those found in the average backyard.

The opening of the zoo marked the first time the Smithsonian enlisted a sponsor for a permanent exhibit in any of their museums. The Smithsonian&#x27;s popular insect zoo, which annually draws more than one million visitors, is the museum&#x27;s only exhibit where living creatures can be seen in their natural environments. The insect zoo, located on the second floor of the museum, focuses not only on strange and beautiful insects, but also on the relationships insects have with plants, other animals and humans.

The exhibit features over 300 live insects and arthropods, including giant cockroaches, tarantulas, tailless whip scorpions and walking sticks. Each of the insects in the zoo live in their own natural habitats, which have been reproduced under the direction of entomologists and museum professionals. Included in the habitat displays are mangrove swamps, a living bee tree, a desert diorama and a tropical rainforest.

In addition, there are plenty of hands-on activities that encourage the OOIZ visitor—adult or child—to get better acquainted with insects and arthropods of all shapes and sizes. Of particular interest in the OOIZ is the &quot;Our House, Their House&quot; display which shows insects living in and around a giant 3-D home. By pushing buttons in front of the house, visitors illuminate the harborage areas for common household insects such as fleas, roaches, carpenter ants and silverfish.

===Junior Pest Investigators===
Orkin&#x27;s Junior Pest Investigators’ program offers free science lesson plans for teachers. These lessons, for students in grades K-6, focus on common pest identification and environmentally friendly ways to help control pests. 
 The lesson plans are based on the National Science Education Standards and provide resources for assessment such as grading rubrics and quizzes.

===Orkin Man school presentations===
The Orkin Man School Presentation program, started in the 1950s, is a learning initiative that allows Orkin employees to educate students in their communities on the roles that insects play in the world and how they affect the environment.

==Training==

===Training program===
Rollins University is a strategic training program that increases its employees’ pest management knowledge. New technicians participate in eight weeks of field and virtual training. Training Magazine has recognized Orkin&#x27;s training program on its Top 125 list several times since 2002.

===Training center===
Located in Atlanta, the training facility includes simulated customer environments, including a house and mock grocery store. The facility also has a commercial kitchen, hospital room, hotel room and warehouse.

==Brand==

===The Orkin Man===
The Orkin Man icon originated from the “Otto the Orkin Man” advertisement, a spray-can cartoon man, in the 1950s. Since then, the Orkin Man has been depicted as the pest control expert (Big Number One campaign), technologically savvy (Exterminator Robot campaign) and scientifically trained to control pests (Pest Control Down to a Science campaign).

The most recognized Orkin uniform consists of a white collared shirt with the Orkin logo and red epaulets and pressed khaki (or gray) pants. The uniform varies depending on an employee&#x27;s job function for safety purposes. Commercial technicians have an additional pocket to store a handheld device used to record service data for on-the-job use.

===The Orkin Truck===
Orkin&#x27;s fleet consists principally of white Ford Ranger and Chevrolet Colorado trucks. Outfitted with Orkin&#x27;s red diamond logo, each truck has a Geotab global positioning system (GPS) vehicle tracking device to help improve routing efficiency so field specialists can increase their time with customers and decrease driving time. Ford ended production of the Ranger in St. Paul, Minnesota on Dec. 16, 2011. Orkin received the last truck off the production line for its service rotation.

Rollins announced in September 2012 that the Toyota Tacoma will replace Orkin&#x27;s fleet of Ford Rangers. Orkin will lease the Tacomas and sell the Rangers as those leases expire. The company plans to replace all Ford Rangers by 2015.

===Franchises===
Orkin has more than 400 owned and operated branch offices and 58 franchises in the U.S. The company has international franchises and subsidiaries in Canada, Europe, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and Mexico. Orkin recently moved into the Australia market with the acquisition of Murray Pest Control, AllPest, Statewide Pest Control and Scientific Pest and Vegetation Management.

===Employees===
Orkin&#x27;s employees have received industry recognition for their service. In 2012, Rick Gaudreault of Collinsville, Ill. was chosen as the “Termite Technician of the Year” by Pest Control Technology magazine. In 2011, Jim Bailey of Columbus, Ohio was honored by Pest Control Technology magazine as the 2010 Commercial Technician of the Year. In 2010, Randy Miller of Greenville, S.C. was chosen by the magazine as the 2009 Residential Technician of the Year.

===The Orkin Pro===
In April 2022, the company changed the direction to move away from the &quot;Orkin Man&quot;, instead going with a more gender neutral approach with the &quot;Orkin Pro&quot;. To launch this new direction, the company created an ad campaign that featured notable sports, television, and social media celebrities.

==Partnerships and sponsorships==

===Nothing But Nets===
Orkin created the “Fight The Bite” campaign in 2008 to help raise money for the purchase and distribution of bed nets in Africa, where 90 percent of malaria-related deaths occur among children. From 2008 to 2011, Orkin donated one mosquito net to &quot;Nothing But Nets &quot; a campaign started by the United Nations Foundation, with the purchase of every mosquito service. &quot;Nothing But Nets &quot; provides insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent deaths by malaria in Africa. Orkin&#x27;s &quot;Fight The Bite&quot; campaign, which also includes donations, raised more than $820,000 in four years.

===Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)===
Orkin has partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on public education initiatives involving pest-related health risks since 2004. The CDC shares their scientific knowledge on pest-related diseases with Orkin employees during bi-annual training sessions. In April and September 2010, Orkin hosted CDC-led training seminars to discuss triatomine bugs (insects that transmit Chagas disease) and insect resistance to pesticides.
Orkin&#x27;s April 2011 training session featured CDC behavioral specialist Dr. Emily Zielinski-Gutierrez, who discussed emerging mosquito-borne and tick-borne diseases in the U.S. and provided prevention measures for technicians to share with homeowners. During the October 2011 seminar, an expert shared rabies transmission facts and prevention tips.
The seminars are broadcast via satellite to Orkin branches throughout the country. Field representatives from Orkin&#x27;s 400 locations view the live broadcasts or access them later through a video-on-demand feature.

===National Pest Management Association===
Orkin serves as the presenting sponsor of the National Pest Management Association’s Women of Excellence Award. The award recognizes one woman each year who displays outstanding leadership skills and significantly contributes to advancing the pest management industry.

===Houston Zoo===
Orkin is an official corporate sponsor of the Houston Zoo, supporting annual programs and community outreach initiatives. Orkin also sponsored the Houston Zoo’s Earth Day celebration in April 2012.
 Orkin partnered with the Houston Zoo to sponsor the DINOSAURS! exhibit, which opened May 4, 2012. Orkin sponsored “Pollinator Palooza” at the Houston Zoo in June 2012 to highlight the role of Earth&#x27;s pollinators.

==Controversies==
Orkin has been the target of various lawsuits across the country for alleged poor service and sloppy methods. Notably, Orkin was investigated for racketeering in Florida for its termite contracting tactics in 2004, with one source reporting over 15,000 consumer complaints in the state over a four-year period. This inquiry comes on top of multiple complaints filed throughout the state alleging fraud and poor performance, as well as similar claims filed across the country.
In 2001, NY Attorney General Spitzer instituted measures to reform Orkin advertising and arbitration for its termite services.

<doc id="1003441" wikidata="Q5532630" url="?curid=1003441" title="Generative science">
<text>Generative science is an area of research that explores the natural world and its complex behaviours. It explores ways &quot;to generate apparently unanticipated and infinite behaviour based on deterministic and finite rules and parameters reproducing or resembling the behavior of natural and social phenomena&quot;. By modelling such interactions, it can suggest that properties exist in the system that had not been noticed in the real world situation. An example field of study is how unintended consequences arise in social processes.

Generative sciences often explore natural phenomena at several levels of organization. Self-organizing natural systems are a central subject, studied both theoretically and by simulation experiments. The study of complex systems in general has been grouped under the heading of &quot;general systems theory&quot;, particularly by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Anatol Rapoport, Ralph Gerard, and Kenneth Boulding.

==Scientific and philosophical origins==


The development of computers and automata theory laid a technical foundation for the growth of the generative sciences. For example:
*Cellular automata are mathematical representations of simple entities interacting under deterministic rules to manifest complex behaviours. They can be used to model emergent processes of the physical universe, neural cognitive processes and social behavior.
**Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is a zero-player game based on cellular automata, meaning that the only input is in setting the initial conditions, and the game is to see how the system evolves.
**In 1996 Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell wrote the book &quot;Growing Artificial Societies&quot; which proposes a set of automaton rules and a system called &quot;Sugarscape&quot; which models a population dependent on resources (called sugar).
*Artificial neural networks attempt to solve problems in the same way that the human brain would, although they are still several orders of magnitude less complex than the human brain and closer to the computing power of a worm. Advances in the understanding of the human brain often stimulate new patterns in neural networks.

One of the most influential advances in the generative sciences as related to cognitive science came from Noam Chomsky&#x27;s (1957) development of generative grammar, which separated language generation from semantic content, and thereby revealed important questions about human language. It was also in the early 1950s that psychologists at the MIT including Kurt Lewin, Jacob Levy Moreno and Fritz Heider laid the foundations for group dynamics research which later developed into social network analysis.

<doc id="1003442" wikidata="Q731392" url="?curid=1003442" title="Bob Carr (Michigan politician)">
<text>Milton Robert Carr (March 27, 1943 – August 27, 2024) was an American lawyer, academic, and politician from Michigan.

Carr served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 6th and 8th congressional districts for eight terms and one term, respectively. Carr&#x27;s career in the U.S. House had a two-year hiatus in which he had lost his seat to Jim Dunn in 1980 before being reelected to Congress in 1982.

Following his career in Congress, Carr became of counsel at a Washington, D.C.–based communications law firm in 2005. He was involved with the United States Association of Former Members of Congress, where he served on the board of directors.

==Background==
Carr was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on March 27, 1943. He received a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison in 1965 and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1968. He did graduate work at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, and was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1968 and to the Michigan bar in 1969. He commenced practice in Lansing, Michigan, and served as Michigan assistant attorney general, from 1970 to 1972.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Carr first ran as a Democrat for Michigan&#x27;s 6th congressional district in 1972, facing eight-term Republican incumbent Charles E. Chamberlain. Chamberlain narrowly defeated Carr by 97,666 votes (50.68%) to 95,029 (49.32%) in what was otherwise a strong Republican year, which persuaded Chamberlain to retire in 1974, when he was succeeded by Carr.

Carr represented the district in the U.S. House for the 94th and to the two succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1981. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1980 to the 97th Congress, being defeated by James Whitney Dunn. Two years later, he defeated Dunn and was elected to the 98th Congress and subsequently re-elected five times. The last two years he represented Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district after the redistricting in 1993. In 1994, he was the Democrats&#x27; nominee for United States Senate in Michigan, losing to Spencer Abraham.

Early in his Congressional career, Carr was described by a columnist for &quot;The Detroit News&quot; as &quot;the classic angry young man.&quot; He called for the resignation of Democratic U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert on national television, but Carr later expressed regret for his early attacks on the Congressional leadership and called them &quot;sheer, naive stupidity.&quot; After taking office in 1975 Carr was named to the House Armed Services Committee, where he focused his attention on ending U.S. involvement in the war in Southeast Asia. On March 12, 1975, with the influential help of House Democratic Caucus Chairman Phillip Burton, Carr authored a resolution that passed the Caucus by 189–49 effectively cutting off further military assistance to South Vietnam or to Cambodia in fiscal year 1975.

After losing and regaining his seat in the 1980 and 1982 elections, respectively, he was named to the House Committee on Appropriations, lowered his profile, and focused his attention on budget and spending issues. He became chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, where he pioneered the use of economic-based criteria and ranks to earmarks requested by members of Congress for their districts.

Carr gave up his seat in the House to run for Senate in 1994, winning the Democratic primary but losing to Republican Spencer Abraham in the general election.

==Later career==
Carr became an adjunct professor at George Washington University&#x27;s Graduate School of Political Management and a senior adviser at the Brookings Institution&#x27;s Brookings Executive Education. He also assisted in the Brookings Institution Fellows program and worked as a consultant in Washington. Prior to his tenures at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution, he worked at the Dow Lohnes law firm in Washington, D.C.

Carr was a member of the board of directors of the United States Association of Former Members of Congress. Carr was also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Personal life and death==
Carr had a daughter.

In 2006 or 2007, Carr was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He was successfully treated with chemotherapy, bortezomib, steroids, and a stem cell transplant. He was subsequently involved in advocating for funding for cancer research and was featured in the Cancer Progress Report 2012. He was later diagnosed with esophageal cancer.

Carr died in Washington on August 27, 2024, at the age of 81.

In 1856, abolitionist senator Charles Sumner gave a speech in which he insulted Butler&#x27;s character. In response, Preston Brooks, Butler&#x27;s first cousin once-removed, caned Sumner on the Senate floor, nearly killing him.

==Biography==
Butler was a son of William Butler and Behethland Butler (1764–1853), and he was born in Edgefield, South Carolina. His early education was at Moses Waddel&#x27;s Willington Academy. He graduated from South Carolina College, now the University of South Carolina. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1818. Butler had two wives; Susan Anne Sirr 1830 and Harriet Hayne who had his only child, Eloise.

==Political history==
Butler was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives as a young man, and in 1824 was elected to the South Carolina Senate. He served two terms and part of a third in the state Senate before being appointed the judge of the session court in 1833. In 1835, Butler was appointed the judge of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas.

==U.S. Senate==

Butler was appointed to the United States Senate in 1846 as a States&#x27; Rights Democrat and elected thereafter to finish the term ending in 1849. He was re-elected by the South Carolina legislature to a full term in 1848 and again re-elected in 1854. He served in the Senate for the remainder of his life and was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during much of that time.

Butler was an ardent advocate of slavery. He was a co-author with Stephen A. Douglas of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. This act provided for westward expansion, but in order to gain Southern support, it repealed the Compromise of 1820 by allowing voting residents of new states the right to choose on allowing slavery.

Butler&#x27;s Senate career is noted for an event at which he was not present. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, during his &quot;Crime Against Kansas&quot; speech in May 1856, denigrated South Carolina and abused Butler personally in terms considered to exceed parliamentary propriety. Sumner likened Butler to Don Quixote and said Butler: &quot;has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight. I mean the harlot, Slavery.&quot; Senator Stephen Douglas, who was also a subject of criticism during the speech, suggested to a colleague while Sumner was orating that &quot;this damn fool [Sumner] is going to get himself shot by some other damn fool.&quot;

South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks, the first cousin once removed of Butler, considered Sumner&#x27;s speech an attack on his family honor. Two days after the speech, Brooks brutally beat Sumner on the Senate floor with a gutta-percha cane, while fellow South Carolina Rep. Laurence Keitt brandished a pistol to prevent other senators from intervening, even as Sumner lay defenseless on the floor and Brooks continued to beat him. Butler later remarked that if present during the speech, he would have called Sumner to order, hoping to prevent further offense.

==Death==
Butler&#x27;s death at age 60 was attributed to dropsy, an archaic term for edema. He was buried in the Butler Family Cemetery near Saluda.

==Evaluation==

U. R. Brooks noted that biographical material to write from was scanty and that Butler&#x27;s power lay in his own presence with &quot;grand gifts of eloquence, action, pathos, and convincing argument.&quot; Ellet wrote 
Senator Andrew Pickens Butler was conceded to be the most unique and original intellect in the Senate. His face, though not handsome, was sturdily expressive, with massive features and &quot;troubled, streaming, silvery hair, that looked as though it had been contending with the blasts of winter&quot;... His power as a speaker stood acknowledged in the admiration of both Houses... Like all men of impetuous impulse, he was very restless; one moment pacing to and fro the space behind the Speaker&#x27;s desk, another giving the grasp of his hand to some younger Senator, the next taking active part in the debates of the day... The moment a question was submitted to him, his mind instinctively applied all the great principles.

==Legacy==
Butler County, Kansas is named for him. His brother William Butler and his nephew Matthew Calbraith Butler also served in the United States Congress.

<doc id="1003448" wikidata="Q3168052" url="?curid=1003448" title="One of a Kind (Bruford album)">
<text>One of a Kind is the second solo album by the drummer Bill Bruford, and the first proper album by his band Bruford. Released in 1979 on EG Records, it is a collection of instrumentals in a style that can loosely be defined as jazz fusion. Bruford features guitarist Allan Holdsworth, bassist Jeff Berlin, and keyboardist Dave Stewart. &quot;Forever Until Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Sahara of Snow&quot; had originally been performed at 1978 concerts by Bruford and Holdsworth’s previous band U.K. They were intended for a studio album, but were never properly recorded by U.K. as Bruford kept the pieces for himself when he and Holdsworth exited the band. U.K. bandmate Eddie Jobson co-wrote &quot;The Sahara of Snow&quot; and reprises his violin part on &quot;Forever Until Sunday&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot; utilizes a fragment penned by his former National Health colleague Alan Gowen (the 3-chord pattern underlying the guitar solo). Holdsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Abingdon Chasp&quot; is the only piece he wrote for Bruford.

==Reception==

In a review for AllMusic, Dave Connolly wrote: &quot;Good-humored twists and turns abound in the music... Those who enjoy their fusion with a healthy dose of rock will find &quot;One of a Kind&quot; a fair match for anything from Return to Forever or Brand X.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot; called the music &quot;strongly melodic, freewheeling and built round Bruford&#x27;s ringing percussion.&quot;

John Kelman of All About Jazz praised the &quot;firmly-cemented group sound, and... consistent set of compositions,&quot; and commented: &quot;The same characteristics found on &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; are evident on &quot;One of a Kind&quot;, with everyone demonstrating palpable growth... the magic of &quot;One of a Kind&quot; is that it remains compelling and accessible... Solos flow organically throughout the long-form compositions, integrated in ways that makes them feel a part of the larger whole.&quot;

Exposé Online&#x27;s Jeff Melton stated: &quot;From the get-go, this collection of ten tracks stands as a maelstrom of chops, arranging skills and inspired ensemble playing... the dynamics between drums, keys and fretless bass provide a high profile, capable structure for Holdsworth&#x27;s top-flight soloing ability.&quot;

In an article for Sounds of Surprise, Matt Phillips wrote: &quot;it&#x27;s music that breathes... played by empathetic, truly virtuosic musicians. But is it rock, jazz, prog or fusion? Who knows, but it&#x27;s some of the greatest British instrumental music of all time.&quot;

<text>William &quot;Red&quot; Holzman (August 10, 1920 – November 13, 1998) was an American professional basketball player and coach. He is best known as the head coach of the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 to 1977, and again from 1978 to 1982. Holzman helped lead the Knicks to two NBA championships in 1970 and 1973, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986.

In 1996, Holzman was named one of the Top 10 Coaches in NBA History.

==Early life==
William &quot;Red&quot; Holzman was born on August 10, 1920, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, to Jewish immigrant parents, as the son of a Romanian mother and Russian father. He grew up in Brooklyn&#x27;s Ocean Hill–Brownsville neighborhood and played basketball for Franklin K. Lane High School in the mid-1930s.

==College career==
Holzman attended the University of Baltimore and later the City College of New York, where he played for two years until graduation in 1942. Holzman joined the United States Navy in the same year, and played on the Norfolk, Virginia Naval Base team till he was discharged from the Navy in 1945.

==Professional career==
===Rochester Royals (1945–1953)===

After the Navy, Holzman joined the NBL Rochester Royals, which won the NBL championship in Holzman&#x27;s first season, and he was named Rookie of the Year in 1944–45. In 1945–46 and 1947–48 he was on the NBL&#x27;s first All League team; in the interim year he was on its second team. Holzman stayed with the team through their move to the NBA and subsequent NBA championship in 1951.

===Milwaukee Hawks (1953–1954)===
In 1953, Holzman left the Royals and joined the Milwaukee Hawks as a player-coach, eventually retiring as a player in 1954 but continuing as the team&#x27;s head coach.

==Coaching career==
===Milwaukee / St. Louis Hawks (1953–1957)===
During the 1956–1957 season, Holzman led the Hawks (then in St. Louis, Missouri) to 19 losses during their first 33 games, and was subsequently fired.

===Leones de Ponce (1963–1967)===
Holzman coached Leones de Ponce from 1963 to 1967, winning three consecutive championships from 1964 to 1966.

===New York Knicks (1967–1977, 1978–1982)===
After being fired by the Hawks, Holzman then became a scout for the New York Knicks for the next ten years, till 1967, whereupon he became the team&#x27;s head coach for the most part until 1982. Holzman&#x27;s former player, Willis Reed, replaced him as Knicks head coach in 1977, but Holzman returned near the start of the 1978–1979 season. During this 15-year span as Knicks&#x27; coach, Holzman won a total of 613 games, including two NBA championships in 1970 and 1973.

In 1969, Holzman coached the Knicks to a then single-season NBA record 18-game win streak, breaking the 17-game record first set back in 1946. For his efforts leading up to the Knicks&#x27; 1970 championship win, Holzman was named the NBA Coach of the Year for that year. He won his second NBA championship as the Knicks won the 1973 NBA Finals against the Lakers. He was one of very few individuals to have won an NBA championship as both player and coach. As a coach, his final record was 696 wins and 604 losses. At the time of his retirement in 1982, he had the second most career victories as a head coach in NBA history.

==Post-playing career==
In 1985, Holzman was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The New York Knicks have retired the number 613 in his honor, equaling the number of wins he accumulated as their head coach. He is also a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Holzman lived with his wife in a home they bought in Cedarhurst, New York in the 1950s. Following his lengthy NBA coaching career, Holzman was diagnosed with leukemia and died at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York in 1998. In 2000, a clock tower was erected in his honor at the intersection of Central Avenue and Cedarhurst Avenue in Cedarhurst as part of “Operation Downtown,” a project started by Nassau County presiding officer Bruce Blakeman and mayor Andy Parise.

<doc id="1003460" wikidata="Q465076" url="?curid=1003460" title="Razia Sultana">
<text>Raziyyat-Ud-Dunya Wa Ud-Din (Hindustani (Hindi): रज़िय्यत उद दुन्या व उद दीन, ; 1205 – 15 October 1240, ), popularly known as Razia Sultana, was a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. She was the first female Muslim ruler of the subcontinent, and the only female Muslim ruler of Delhi.

A daughter of Mamluk Sultan Shamsuddin Iltutmish, Razia administered Delhi during 1231–1232 when her father was busy in the Gwalior campaign. According to a possibly aprocryphal legend, impressed by her performance during this period, Iltutmish nominated Razia as his heir apparent after returning to Delhi. Iltutmish was succeeded by Razia&#x27;s half-brother Ruknuddin Firuz, whose mother Shah Turkan planned to execute her. During a rebellion against Ruknuddin, Razia instigated the general public against Shah Turkan, and ascended the throne after Ruknuddin was deposed in 1236.

Razia&#x27;s ascension was challenged by a section of nobles, some of whom ultimately joined her, while the others were defeated. The Turkic nobles who supported her expected her to be a figurehead, but she increasingly asserted her power. This, combined with her appointments of non-Turkic officers to important posts, led to their resentment against her. She was deposed by a group of nobles in April 1240, after having ruled for less than four years. She married one of the rebels – Ikhtiyaruddin Altunia – and attempted to regain the throne, but was defeated by her half-brother and successor Muizuddin Bahram in October that year, and was killed shortly after.

== Names and titles ==

Razia&#x27;s name is also transliterated as Raḍiyya or Raziyya. The term &quot;Sultana&quot;, used by some modern writers, is a misnomer as it means &quot;the king&#x27;s wife&quot; rather than &quot;female ruler&quot;. Razia&#x27;s own coins call her &quot;Sultan Jalalat al-Duniya wal-Din&quot; or as &quot;al-Sultan al-Muazzam Raziyat al-Din bint al-Sultan&quot;. The Sanskrit-language inscriptions of the Sultanate call her &quot;Jallaladina&quot;, while near-contemporary historian Minhaj calls her &quot;Sultan Raziyat al-Duniya wa&#x27;l Din bint al-Sultan&quot;. Another masculine title, &quot;padshah (badshah)&quot; was also given to Razia.

== Early life ==

Razia was born to the Delhi Sultan Shamsuddin Iltutmish, an Ilbari Turkic slave (&quot;mamluk&quot;) of his predecessor Qutb ud-Din Aibak. Razia&#x27;s mother – Turkan Khatun was a daughter of Qutb ud-Din Aibak, and the chief wife of Iltutmish. Razia was the eldest daughter of Iltutmish, and probably his first-born child.

== Ascension to the throne ==

Iltutmish had groomed his eldest son Nasiruddin Mahmud to be his successor, but this son died unexpectedly in 1229. According to historian Minhaj-i-Siraj, Iltutmish believed his other sons were absorbed in pleasurable activities, and would be incapable of managing the state affairs after his death. While leaving for his Gwalior campaign in 1231, Iltutmish left his daughter Razia as in-charge of Delhi&#x27;s administration. Razia performed her duties so well that after returning to Delhi, Iltutmish decided to name her as his successor. Iltutmish ordered his officer &quot;mushrif-i mamlakat&quot; Tajul Mulk Mahmud Dabir to prepare a decree naming Razia as the heir apparent. When his nobles questioned this decision on the basis that he had surviving sons, Iltutmish replied that Razia was more capable than his sons.

However, after Iltutmish&#x27;s death, the nobles appointed his son Ruknuddin Firuz as the new king. Possibly, during his last years, Iltutmish had agreed to appoint a son as his successor. This is suggested by the fact that after becoming seriously ill, he had recalled Ruknuddin from Lahore to Delhi. Another possibility is that the legend of Iltutmish nominating Razia as his successor is a false story circulated by Razia&#x27;s supporters after her ascension. Minhaj is the only near-contemporary source that narrates this legend, and he did not witness the events or the alleged decree himself: he was in Gwalior at the time, and did not return to Delhi until 1238.

Ruknuddin was not an able ruler, and left the control of administration to his mother Shah Turkan. The duo&#x27;s blinding and execution of Iltutmish&#x27;s popular son Qutubuddin, combined with Shah Turkan&#x27;s high-handedness, led to rebellions by several nobles, and even the &quot;wazir&quot; (prime minister) &quot;Nizamul Mulk&quot; Junaidi joined the rebels. This situation became worse, when the Turkic-origin slave officers close to Ruknuddin planned killings of the sultanate&#x27;s &quot;Tazik&quot; (non-Turkic) officers. This led to the murders of several important Tazik officers, including Junaidi&#x27;s son Ziyaul Mulk and Tajul Mulk Mahmud, who had drawn up the decree declaring Razia as the heir apparent. While Ruknuddin marched towards Kuhram to fight the rebels, Shah Turkan planned to execute Razia in Delhi. At a congregational prayer, Razia instigated the general public against Shah Turkan. A mob then attacked the royal palace and detained Shah Turkan. Several nobles and the army pledged allegiance to Razia, and placed her on the throne, making her the first female Muslim ruler in South Asia. Ruknuddin marched back to Delhi, but Razia sent a force to arrest him: he was imprisoned and probably executed on 19 November 1236, having ruled for less than 7 months.

Razia&#x27;s ascension to the throne of Delhi was unique not only because she was a woman, but also because the support from the general public was the driving force behind her appointment. According to the 14th century text &quot;Futuh-us-Salatin&quot;, she had asked the people to depose her if she failed to meet their expectations.

== Opposition to ascension ==

From the beginning of her reign, Razia faced stiff opposition from nobles of Turkic origin. She had ascended the throne with the support of the general public of Delhi rather than that of the powerful Turkic-origin provincial governor
. Razia attempted to offset the power of the Turkic nobility by creating a class of non-Turkic nobles, which led to further opposition from the Turkic nobles.

&quot;Nizamul Mulk&quot; Muhammad Junaidi, a &#x27;Tazik&#x27; (non-Turkic) officer who had held the post of the &quot;wazir&quot; (prime minister) since Iltutmish&#x27;s time, refused to accept her ascension. He was joined by four Turkic nobles, who had also rebelled against Razia&#x27;s predecessor Ruknuddin. These nobles included &quot;Malik&quot; Izzuddin Muhammad Salari of Badaun, &quot;Malik&quot; Izzuddin Kabir Khan Ayaz of Multan, &quot;Malik&quot; Saifuddin Kuchi of Hansi, and &quot;Malik&quot; Alauddin Jani of Lahore. When these nobles marched against Razia from different directions, she sought help from &quot;Malik&quot; Nusratuddin Taisi, whom she had appointed as the governor of Awadh. However, shortly after crossing the Ganges on his way to Delhi, Taisi was captured by Kuchi&#x27;s forces and died in captivity. 

Razia then led an army out of the fortified city of Delhi to fight the rebels and set up a camp on the banks of the Yamuna River. After some indecisive skirmishes, the rebel leaders Muhammad Salari and Izzuddin Kabir Khan Ayaz decided to join Razia. They secretly met with Razia, and the group planned to arrest other rebel leaders, including Junaidi. However, Junaidi and other rebel leaders learned about the plan, and escaped, pursued by Razia&#x27;s forces. Saifuddin Kuchi and his brother Fakhruddin were captured, imprisoned, and later executed. Junaidi fled to the Sirmaur hills and died there. Alauddin Jani was killed at the Nakawan village, and his head was later brought to Delhi. 

== Reign ==

Immediately after ascending the throne, Razia made several important appointments. She appointed Khwaja Muhazzabuddin as her new &quot;wazir&quot; (prime minister), and conferred the title &quot;Nizamul Mulk&quot; upon him. Muhazzabuddin had earlier served as deputy to the previous &quot;wazir&quot; Junaidi. Razia appointed &quot;Malik&quot; Saifuddin Aibek Bahtu as the in-charge of her army, and conferred the title &quot;Qutlugh Khan&quot; upon him. However, Saifuddin died soon after, and Razia appointed &quot;Malik&quot; Qutubuddin Hasan Ghuri to the newly created office of &quot;naib-i lashkar&quot; (in-charge of the army). Razia assigned the iqta&#x27; of Lahore, formerly held by the slain rebel Alauddin Jani, to &quot;Malik&quot; Izzuddin Kabir Khan Ayaz, the rebel who had joined her. Razia appointed her loyalists to imperial household positions, including &quot;Malik-i Kabir&quot; Ikhtiyaruddin Aitigin as &quot;Amir-i Hajib&quot; and &quot;Malik&quot; Jamaluddin Yaqut as &quot;Amir-i Akhur&quot;.

Minhaj mentions that soon, all the nobles from Lakhnauti in the east to Debal in the west acknowledged her authority. Razia&#x27;s first military campaign directed at non-rebels was an invasion of Ranthambore, whose Chahamana ruler had asserted his sovereignty after Iltutmish&#x27;s death. Razia directed &quot;Malik&quot; Qutubuddin Hasan Ghuri to march to Ranthambore: he was able to evacuate the Turkic nobles and officers from the fort, but was unable to subjugate the Chahamanas. The Chahamanas, in alliance with the Mewatis, captured a large part of present-day north-eastern Rajasthan, and carried out guerilla war around Delhi. Razia also sent a force to re-assert Delhi&#x27;s control over Gwalior, but this campaign had to be aborted.

During Razia&#x27;s reign,the Shias revolted against the Sultanate, but the rebellion was suppressed. In a major incident, the Shia Qarmatians carried out an attack on the Jama masjid in Delhi. The Qarmatian leader Nuruddin Turk had earlier condemned the Sunni Shafi‘i and Hanafi doctrines, and had gathered nearly 1,000 supporters from Delhi, Gujarat, Sindh, and the Doab. On 5 March 1237, he and his supporters entered the mosque, and started killing the Sunnis assembled there for the Friday prayers, before being attacked by the citizens.

In 1238, Malik Hasan Qarlugh, the former Khwarazmian governor of Ghazni, faced a threat from the Mongols, and sent his son to Delhi, probably to seek a military alliance against the Mongols. Razia received the prince courteously, assigned him the revenues of Baran for his expenses, but refused to form an alliance against the Mongols.

== Overthrow ==

The nobles who supported Razia intended her to be a figurehead, but she increasingly asserted herself. For example, her initial coins were issued with her father&#x27;s name, but by 1237–1238, she had started issuing coins solely in her own name. Isami mentions that initially, she observed purdah: a screen separated her throne from the courtiers and the general public, and she was surrounded by female guards. However, later, she started appearing in public dressed in traditional male attire, wearing a cloak (&quot;qaba&quot;) and a hat (&quot;kulah&quot;). She rode on elephants through the streets of Delhi, making public appearances like the earlier Sultans.

Razia&#x27;s increasing assertiveness and her appointment of non-Turkic people to important posts created resentment among the Turkic nobles. The post of &quot;Amir-i Akhur&quot; had previously been held by officers of Turkic origin, and Yaqut was of Abyssinian origin: therefore, Razia&#x27;s Turkic officers resented this appointment. Chroniclers such as Isami, Sirhindi, Badauni, Firishta, and Nizamuddin Ahmad attribute Razia&#x27;s intimacy with Yaqut as a major cause of her downfall.

In 1238–1239, &quot;Malik&quot; Izudin Kabir Khan Ayaz – the governor of Lahore – rebelled against Razia, and she marched against him, forcing him to flee to Sodhra. Because the area beyond Sodhra was controlled by the Mongols, and because Razia continued to pursue him, Izzuddin was forced to surrender and accept Razia&#x27;s authority once again. Razia treated him leniently; she took away the iqta of Lahore from him, but assigned him the iqta of Multan, which Iltutmish had assigned to Ikhtiyaruddin Qaraqash Khan Aitigin.

Razia had recalled Ikhtiyaruddin Aitigin, a Turkic slave purchased by Iltutmish, to her court in Delhi, and made him &quot;Amir-i Hajib&quot;. She had also bestowed favours upon another slave of Iltutmish – Ikhtiyaruddin Altunia, by assigning him first the iqta of Baran, and then, the iqta of Tabarhinda. However, these two officers conspired with other Turkic officers to overthrow her, while she was away on the Lahore campaign. Razia arrived in Delhi on 3 April 1240, and learned that Altunia had rebelled against her in Tabarhinda. Unaware that other nobles in Delhi had joined Altunia in conspiring against her, Razia marched towards Tabarhinda ten days later. At Tabarhinda, the rebel forces killed her loyalist Yaqut, and imprisoned her.

According to Minhaj, Razia ruled for 3 years, 6 months, and 6 days.

== Alliance with Altunia and death ==

When the news of Razia&#x27;s arrest reached Delhi, the rebel nobles there appointed Muizuddin Bahram – a son of Iltutmish – on the throne. He formally ascended the throne on 21 April 1240, and the nobles pledged allegiance to him on 5 May 1240. The nobles expected the new king to be a figurehead, and intended to control the affairs of the state through the newly created office of &quot;naib-i mamlakat&quot; (equivalent to regent), which was assigned to Ikhtiyaruddin Aitigin. However, the new king had Ikhtiyaruddin Aitigin assassinated within 1–2 months.

After deposing Razia, the nobles at Delhi had distributed important offices and iqtas among themselves, ignoring claims of Ikhtiyaruddin Altunia, who had arrested Razia at Tabarhinda. After Aitigin&#x27;s death, Altunia lost all hope of realizing any benefits from Razia&#x27;s overthrow, and decided to ally with her. Razia also saw this as an opportunity to win back the throne, and married Altunia in September 1240. The two were supported by some other disgruntled Turkic nobles, including &quot;Malik&quot; Qaraqash and &quot;Malik&quot; Salari.

Altunia assembled an army, which according to Abdul Malik Isami, included Khokhars, Jats, and Rajputs. In September–October 1240, Sultan Muizuddin Bahram led an army against the forces of Altunia and Razia, and defeated them on 14 October 1240. Altunia and Razia were forced to retreat to Kaithal, where they were deserted by their soldiers, and were killed by a group of Hindus. Razia was killed on 15 October 1240. 

She remains the only woman to have sat upon the throne of Delhi.

== Tomb ==

The grave of Razia is located at Mohalla Bulbuli Khana near Turkman Gate in Old Delhi. The 14th century traveler Ibn Batuta mentions that Razia&#x27;s tomb had become a pilgrimage centre: A dome had been built over it, and people sought blessings from it.

Razia&#x27;s grave is said to have been built by her successor and half-brother Bahram. Another grave, said to be of her sister Shazia, is located beside her grave. Razia was a devotee of the Sufi saint Shah Turkman Bayabani, and the place where she is buried is said to be his hospice (khanqah).

Today, the site is largely neglected: the Archaeological Survey of India performs annual maintenance to it, but has been unable to beautify it further because it is surrounded by illegal construction, and is approachable only through a narrow, congested lane. In the late 20th century, the local residents constructed a mosque near it.

A ruined building in Kaithal is purported to be the site of Razia&#x27;s original grave.

==Coins==
Coins of Razia are found in silver and billon; one gold coin of Bengal style is also known. Silver Tankas were issued from both Bengal (Lakhnauti) and Delhi. Initially she issued coins from Delhi in the name of her father Iltumish citing the title &quot;Nasrat&quot; i.e. female title of &quot;Nasir&quot;.

<text>Agatharchides is a lunar impact crater located at the southern edge of Oceanus Procellarum, in the region between the Mare Humorum and Mare Nubium. To the east-southeast is the crater Bullialdus, and to the south-southwest lies Loewy. It is named after the Greek geographer Agatharchides.

The interior of the crater has been inundated by lava in the past, resurfacing the floor. The damaged outer wall varies considerably in height, ranging from level with the surface to rising as high as 1.5 km. The most intact portions of the wall are along the east and the west-southwest, while the rim is nearly non-existent to the north and heavily damaged to the south. A small craterlet lies along the western rim. The interior floor is marked only by a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Agatharchides.

<text>Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave is a work of prose fiction by Aphra Behn (1640–1689), first published in 1688 by William Canning and reprinted later that year in the compilation &quot;Three Histories by Mrs. A. Behn&quot;. The eponymous hero is an African prince from Coramantien who is tricked into slavery and sold to European colonists in Surinam where he meets the narrator. Behn&#x27;s text is a first-person account of Oroonoko&#x27;s life, love, and rebellion.

Behn, often cited as the first known professional female writer, was a successful playwright, poet, translator and essayist. She began writing prose fiction in the 1680s, probably in response to the consolidation of theatres that led to a reduced need for new plays. Published less than a year before she died, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is sometimes described as one of the first novels in English. Interest in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; has increased since the 1970s, with critics arguing that Behn is the foremother of British female writers, and that &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is a crucial text in the history of the novel.

The novel&#x27;s success was jump-started by a popular 1695 theatrical adaptation by Thomas Southerne, which ran regularly on the British stage throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.

==Plot summary and analysis==
===Plot summary===
&quot;Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave&quot; is a relatively short novel set in a narrative frame. The narrator opens with an account of the colony of Surinam and its inhabitants. Within this is a historical tale concerning the Coramantien grandson of an African king, Prince Oroonoko. At a very young age Prince Oroonoko was trained for battle, becoming an expert captain by the age of seventeen. During a battle the best general sacrifices himself for the Prince by taking an arrow for him. In sight of this event, the Prince takes the place of General. Oroonoko decides to honorably visit the daughter of the deceased general to offer the &quot;Trophies of her Father&#x27;s Victories&quot;, but he immediately falls in love with Imoinda and later asks for her hand in marriage.

The king hears Imoinda described as the most beautiful and charming in the land, and he also falls in love. Despite his Intelligence saying she had been claimed by Oroonoko, the king gives Imoinda the royal veil, thus forcing her to become one of his wives, even though she is already promised to Oroonoko. Imoinda unwillingly, but dutifully, enters the king&#x27;s harem (the Otan), and Oroonoko is comforted by his assumption that the king is too old to ravish her. Over time the Prince plans a tryst with the help of the sympathetic Onahal (one of the king&#x27;s wives) and Aboan (a friend to the prince). The Prince and Imoinda are reunited for a short time and consummate their marriage, but they are eventually discovered. Imoinda and Onahal are punished for their actions by being sold as slaves. The king&#x27;s guilt, however, leads him to lie to Oroonoko that Imoinda has instead been executed, since death was thought to be better than slavery. The Prince grieves. Later, after winning another tribal war, Oroonoko and his men visit a European slave trader on his ship and are tricked and shackled after drinking. The slave trader plans to sell the Prince and his men as slaves and carries them to Surinam in the West Indies. Oroonoko is purchased by a Cornish man named Trefry, but given special treatment due to his education and ability to speak French and English (which he learned from his own French mentor). Trefry mentions that he came to own a most beautiful enslaved woman and had to stop himself from raping her. Unbeknownst to Oroonoko, Trefry is speaking of Imoinda who is at the same plantation. The two lovers are reunited under the slave names of Caesar and Clemene.

The narrator and Trefry continue to treat the hero as an honored guest. The narrator recounts various entertaining episodes, including reading, hunting, visiting native villages, and capturing a &quot;numb eel&quot;. Oroonoko and Imoinda live as husband and wife in their own slave cottage, and once she becomes pregnant, Oroonoko petitions for their return to the homeland. After being put off with vague promises of the governor&#x27;s arrival, Oroonoko organizes a slave revolt. The slaves, including Imoinda, fight valiantly, but the majority surrender when deputy governor Byam promises them amnesty. After the surrender, Oroonoko and Tuscan, his second-in-command, are punished and whipped by their former allies at the command of Byam. To avenge his honor, Oroonoko vows to kill Byam. He worries, however, that to do so would make Imoinda vulnerable to reprisal after his death. The couple both decide that he should kill her, and so Imoinda dies by his hand. Oroonoko hides in the woods to mourn her and grows weaker, becoming unable to complete his revenge. When he is discovered, he decides to show his fearlessness in the face of death. Oroonoko cuts off a piece of his own throat, disembowels himself, and stabs the first man who tries to approach him. Once captured, he is bound to a post. Resigned to his death, Oroonoko asks for a pipe to smoke as Banister has him quartered and dismembered.

===Analysis===
The novel is written in a mixture of first and third person, as the narrator relates events in Africa secondhand, and herself witnesses, and participates in, the actions that take place in Surinam. The narrator is a lady who has come to Surinam with her unnamed father, a man intended to be the new lieutenant-general of the colony. He, however, dies on the voyage from illness. The narrator and her family are put up in the finest house in the settlement, in accord with their station, and the narrator&#x27;s experiences of meeting the indigenous peoples and slaves are intermixed with the main plot of Oroonoko and Imoinda. At the conclusion of the narrative, the narrator leaves Surinam for London.

Structurally, there are three significant pieces to the narrative, which does not flow in a strictly biographical manner. The novel opens with a statement of veracity, wherein the narrator claims to be writing neither fiction nor pedantic history. She claims to be an eyewitness and to be writing without any embellishment or agenda, relying solely upon real events. A description of Surinam and the Southern American Indians follows. The narrator regards the indigenous peoples as innocent and living in a golden age. Next, she provides the history of Oroonoko in Africa: the betrayal by his grandfather, the captivity of Imoinda, and his capture by the slaver captain. The narrative then returns to Surinam and the present: Oroonoko and Imoinda are reunited, and Oroonoko and Imoinda meet the narrator and Trefry. The final section describes Oroonoko&#x27;s rebellion and its aftermath.

==Biographical and historical background==
&quot;Oroonoko&quot; is now the most studied of Aphra Behn&#x27;s novels, but it was not immediately successful in her own lifetime. It sold well, but the adaptation for the stage by Thomas Southerne (see below) made the story as popular as it became. Soon after her death, the novel began to be read again, and from that time onward the factual claims made by the novel&#x27;s narrator, and the factuality of the whole plot of the novel, have been accepted and questioned with greater and lesser credulity. Because Mrs. Behn was not available to correct or confirm any information, early biographers assumed the first-person narrator was Aphra Behn speaking for herself and incorporated the novel&#x27;s claims into their accounts of her life. It is important, however, to recognise that &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is a work of fiction and that its first-person narrator—the protagonist—need be no more factual than Jonathan Swift&#x27;s first-person narrator, ostensibly Gulliver, in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Daniel Defoe&#x27;s shipwrecked narrator in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, or the first-person narrator of &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;.

===Fact and fiction in the narrator===

Researchers today cannot say whether or not the narrator of &quot;Oroonoko&quot; represents Aphra Behn and, if so, tells the truth.

Scholars have argued for over a century about whether or not Behn even visited Suriname and, if so, when. On one hand, the narrator reports that she &quot;saw&quot; sheep in the colony, when the settlement had to import meat from Virginia, as sheep, in particular, could not survive there. Also, as Ernest Bernbaum argues in &quot;Mrs. Behn&#x27;s &#x27;Oroonoko&#x27;&quot;, everything substantive in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; could have come from accounts by William Byam and George Warren that were circulating in London in the 1660s. However, as J. A. Ramsaran and Bernard Dhuiq catalogue, Behn provides a great deal of precise local colour and physical description of the colony. Topographical and cultural verisimilitude were not a criterion for readers of novels and plays in Behn&#x27;s day any more than in Thomas Kyd&#x27;s, and Behn generally did not bother with attempting to be accurate in her locations in other stories. Her plays have indistinct settings, and she rarely spends time with topographical description in her stories.

Secondly, all the Europeans mentioned in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; were really present in Surinam in the 1660s. Finally, the characterization of the real-life people in the novel does follow Behn&#x27;s own politics; Behn was a lifelong and militant royalist, and her fictions are consistent in portraying virtuous royalists and put-upon nobles who are opposed by petty and evil republicans/Parliamentarians. Byam and James Bannister, both actual royalists in the Interregnum, are characterized as malicious, licentious, and sadistic, while George Marten, a Cromwellian republican, is reasonable, open-minded, and fair.

The earliest biographers of Aphra Behn not only accepted the novel&#x27;s narrator&#x27;s claims as true, but Charles Gildon even invented a romantic liaison between the author and the title character, while the anonymous &quot;Memoirs of Aphra Behn, Written by One of the Fair Sex&quot; (both 1698) insisted that the author was too young to be romantically available at the time of the novel&#x27;s events.

===Models for Oroonoko===
One figure who matches aspects of Oroonoko is John Allin, a settler in Surinam. Allin was disillusioned and miserable in Surinam, and he took to heavy drinking and uttering wild, lavish blasphemies so shocking that Byam believed that the repetition of them at Allin&#x27;s trial cracked the foundation of the courthouse. In the novel, Oroonoko plans to kill Byam and then himself, and this matches a plot that Allin had to kill Lord Willoughby and then commit suicide, for, he said, it was impossible to &quot;possess my own life, when I cannot enjoy it with freedom and honour&quot;. He wounded Willoughby and was taken to prison, where he killed himself with an overdose. His body was taken to a pillory,

While Behn was in Surinam (1663), she would have seen a slave ship arrive with 130 &quot;freight&quot;, 54 having been &quot;lost&quot; in transit. Although the African slaves were not treated differently from the indentured servants coming from Europe (and were, in fact, more highly valued), their cases were hopeless, and both slaves, indentured servants, and local inhabitants attacked the settlement. There was no single rebellion, however, that matched what is related in &quot;Oroonoko.&quot; Further, the character of Oroonoko is physically different from the other slaves by being blacker skinned, having a Roman nose, and having straight hair. The lack of historical record of a mass rebellion, the unlikeliness of the physical description of the character (when Europeans at the time had no clear idea of race or an inheritable set of &quot;racial&quot; characteristics), and the European courtliness of the character suggests that he is most likely invented wholesale. Additionally, the character&#x27;s name is artificial. There are names in the Yoruba language that are similar, but the African slaves of Surinam were from Ghana.

Instead of from life, the character seems to come from literature, for his name is reminiscent of &quot;Oroondates,&quot; a character in La Calprenède&#x27;s &quot;Cassandra,&quot; which Behn had read. Oroondates is a prince of Scythia whose desired bride is snatched away by an elder king. Previous to this, there is an Oroondates who is the satrap of Memphis in the &quot;Æthiopica&quot;, a novel from late antiquity by Heliodorus of Emesa. Many of the plot elements in Behn&#x27;s novel are reminiscent of those in the &quot;Æthiopica&quot; and other Greek romances of the period. There is a particular similarity to the story of Juba in La Calprenède&#x27;s romance &quot;Cléopâtre&quot;, who becomes a slave in Rome and is given a Roman name—Coriolanus—by his captors, as Oroonoko is given the Roman name of Caesar.

Alternatively, it could be argued that &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is a homophone for the Orinoco River, along which the colony of Surinam was established and it is possible to see the character as an allegorical figure for the mismanaged territory itself. Oroonoko, and the crisis of values of aristocracy, slavery, and worth he represents to the colonists, is emblematic of the new world and colonisation itself: a person like Oroonoko is symptomatic of a place like the Orinoco.

The name &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is also associated with tobacco.

===Slavery and Behn&#x27;s attitudes===
According to biographer Janet Todd, Behn did not oppose slavery &quot;per se.&quot; She accepted the idea that powerful groups would enslave the powerless, and she would have grown up with Oriental tales of &quot;The Turk&quot; taking European slaves. Although it has never been proven that Behn was actually married, the most likely candidate for her husband is Johan Behn, who sailed on &quot;The King David&quot; from the German imperial free city of Hamburg. This Johan Behn was a slaver whose residence in London later was probably a result of acting as a mercantile cover for Dutch trade with the colony of Suriname under a false flag. One could argue that if Aphra Behn had been opposed to slavery as an institution, it is not very likely that she would have married a slave trader. At the same time, it is fairly clear that she was not happy in marriage, and &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, written twenty years after the death of her husband, has, among its cast of characters, no one more evil than the slave ship captain who tricks and captures Oroonoko. It can also be argued that Behn&#x27;s attitude towards slavery can be exemplified through her characterisations of Oroonoko and Imoinda, who are both given significantly positive attributes. Oroonoko was a strong, brave, heroic figure, while Imoinda was beautiful and pure in her ways.

The final words of the novel offer a slight expiation of the narrator&#x27;s guilt, but it is for the individual man she mourns and to him that she writes a tribute, and she lodges no protest over slavery itself. A natural king could not be enslaved, and, as in &quot;The Young King&quot;, the play that Behn wrote in Surinam, no land could prosper without a king. Her fictional Surinam is a headless body. Without a true and natural leader (a king) the feeble and corrupt men of position abuse their power. What was missing was Lord Willoughby, or the narrator&#x27;s father, a true lord. In the absence of such leadership a true king, Oroonoko, is misjudged, mistreated, and killed.

One possible motive for the novel, or at least one political inspiration, was Behn&#x27;s view that Surinam was a fruitful and potentially wealthy settlement that needed only a true noble to lead it. Like others sent to investigate the colony, she felt that Charles was not properly informed of the place&#x27;s potential. When Charles gave up Surinam in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda, Behn was dismayed. This dismay is enacted in the novel in a graphic fashion: if the colony was mismanaged and the slaves mistreated by having an insufficiently noble ruler there, then the democratic and mercantile Dutch would be far worse. Accordingly, the passionate misrule of Byam is replaced by the efficient and immoral management of the Dutch. Charles had a strategy for a united North American presence, however, and his gaining of New Amsterdam for Surinam was part of that larger vision. Neither Charles II nor Aphra Behn could have known how correct Charles&#x27;s bargain was, but &quot;Oroonoko&quot; can be seen as a royalist&#x27;s demurral.

==Historical significance==
Behn was a political writer of fiction and for the stage, and though not didactic in purpose, most of her works have distinct political content. The timing of &quot;Oroonoko&quot;&#x27;s publication must be seen in its own context as well as in the larger literary tradition (see below). According to Charles Gildon, Aphra Behn wrote &quot;Oroonoko&quot; even with company present, and Behn&#x27;s own account suggests that she wrote the novel in a single sitting, with her pen scarcely rising from the paper. If Behn travelled to Surinam in 1663–64, she felt no need for twenty-four years to write her &quot;American story&quot; and then felt a sudden and acute passion for telling it in 1688. It is therefore wise to consider what changes were in the air in that year that could account for the novel.

The year 1688 was a time of massive anxiety in Crown politics. Charles II had died in February 1685, and James II came to the throne later in the same year. James&#x27;s purported Roman Catholicism and his marriage to an avowedly Roman Catholic bride roused the old Parliamentarian forces to speak of rebellion again. This is the atmosphere for the writing of &quot;Oroonoko.&quot; One of the most notable features of the novel is that Oroonoko insists, over and over again, that a king&#x27;s word is sacred, that a king must never betray his oaths, and that a measure of a person&#x27;s worth is the keeping of vows. Given that men who had sworn fealty to James were now casting about for a way of getting a new king, this insistence on fidelity must have struck a chord. Additionally, the novel is fanatically anti-Dutch and anti-democratic, even if it does, as noted above, praise faithful former republicans like Trefry over faithless former royalists like Byam. In as much as the candidate preferred by the Whig Party for the throne was William of Orange, the novel&#x27;s stern reminders of Dutch atrocities in Surinam and powerful insistence on the divine and emanate nature of royalty were likely designed to awaken Tory objections.

Behn&#x27;s side would lose the contest, and the Glorious Revolution would end with the Act of Settlement 1701, whereby Protestantism would take precedence over sanguineous processes in the choice of monarch ever after. Indeed, so thoroughly did the Stuart cause fail that readers of &quot;Oroonoko&quot; may miss the topicality of the novel.

==Literary significance==
Claims for &quot;Oroonoko&#x27;s&quot; being the &quot;first English novel&quot; are difficult to sustain. In addition to the usual problems of defining the novel as a genre, Aphra Behn had written at least one epistolary novel prior to &quot;Oroonoko.&quot; The epistolary work &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot; predates &quot;Oroonoko&quot; by more than five years. However, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is one of the very early novels of the particular sort that possesses a linear plot and follows a biographical model. It is a mixture of theatrical drama, reportage, and biography that is easy to recognise as a novel.

&quot;Oroonoko&quot; is the first European novel to show Africans in a sympathetic manner. At the same time, this novel is as much about the nature of kingship as it is about the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel&#x27;s regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn&#x27;s previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses with a great deal of the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn&#x27;s fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.

Critical response to the novel has been coloured by the struggle over the debate over the slave trade and the struggle for female equality. In the 18th century, audiences for Southerne&#x27;s theatrical adaptation and readers of the novel responded to the love triangle in the plot. &quot;Oroonoko&quot; on the stage was regarded as a great tragedy and a highly romantic and moving story, and on the page as well the tragic love between Oroonoko and Imoinda, and the menace of Byam, captivated audiences. As the European and American disquiet with slavery grew, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was increasingly seen as protest to slavery. Wilbur L. Cross wrote, in 1899, that &quot;&quot;Oroonoko&quot; is the first humanitarian novel in English.&quot; He credits Aphra Behn with having opposed slavery and mourns the fact that her novel was written too early to succeed in what he sees as its purpose (Moulton 408). Indeed, Behn was regarded explicitly as a precursor of Harriet Beecher Stowe. In the 20th century, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; has been viewed as an important marker in the development of the &quot;noble savage&quot; theme, a precursor of Rousseau and a furtherance of Montaigne, as well as a proto-feminist work.

Recently (and sporadically in the 20th century) the novel has been seen in the context of 17th-century politics and 16th-century literature. Janet Todd argues that Behn deeply admired &quot;Othello&quot;, and identified elements of &quot;Othello&quot; in the novel. In Behn&#x27;s longer career, her works center on questions of kingship quite frequently, and Behn herself took a radical philosophical position. Her works question the virtues of noble blood as they assert, repeatedly, the mystical strength of kingship and of great leaders. The character of Oroonoko solves Behn&#x27;s questions by being a natural king and a natural leader, a man who is anointed and personally strong, and he is poised against nobles who have birth but no actual strength.

==The New World setting==
With &quot;Oroonoko,&quot; Aphra Behn took on the challenge of blending contemporary literary concerns, which were often separated by genre, into one cohesive work. Restoration literature had three common elements: the New World setting, courtly romance, and the concept of heroic tragedy. John Dryden, a prominent playwright in 1663, co-wrote &quot;The Indian Queen&quot; and wrote the sequel &quot;The Indian Emperour&quot;. Both plays have the three aspects of Restoration literature, and &quot;Behn was certainly familiar with both plays&quot;, influencing her writing as seen in the opening of the tale. Behn takes the Restoration themes and recreates them, bringing originality. One reason Behn may have changed the elements is because &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was written near the end of the Restoration period. Readers were aware of the theme, so Behn wanted to give them something fresh. Behn changed the New World setting, creating one that readers were unfamiliar with. Challenging her literary abilities even further, Behn recreates the Old World setting. Behn gives readers an exotic world, filling their heads with descriptive details. Behn was the first person to blend new elements with the old Restoration essentials. The New World was set in the contemporary Caribbean, not in Mexico as previous centuries were accustomed to. The New World gave readers knowledge of a foreign place, &quot;a colony in America called Surinam, in the West Indies&quot;. Behn paints a picture-perfect New World unspoiled by natives—one that contrasts with Dryden&#x27;s previous work. Behn&#x27;s New World seems almost utopian as she describes how the people get along: &quot;with these People, ... we live in perfect Tranquility, and good Understanding, as it behooves us to do.&quot; This New World is unique during this period; it is &quot;simultaneously a marvelous prelapsarian paradise and the thoroughly commercialised crossroads of international trade&quot;. It seems hard to believe that in such a romantic setting Behn can blend heroic tragedy, yet she accomplishes this effect through the character of Oroonoko. The Old World changes as Behn recreates the trade route back across the Atlantic to Africa, instead of Europe, becoming &quot;the first European author who attempted to render the life lived by sub-Saharan African characters on their own continent.&quot; There were few accounts of coastal African kingdoms at that time. &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is truly an original play blending three important elements in completely original ways, with her vision of the New World constituting a strong example of the change.

Although Behn assures that she is not looking to entertain her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi had stressed that &quot;spectacle was the main mediator&quot; for the representation of foreign cultures in the Restoration era. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko&#x27;s native beauty as a spectacle of &#x27;beauty so transcending&#x27; that surpassed &#x27;all those of his gloomy race&#x27;. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko&#x27;s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color of his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an aristocrat, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Europeaness is incomplete. He has the European-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko&#x27;s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko&#x27;s foreignness into familiar European narratives.

==Character list==
* Oroonoko – The protagonist of the story. Love interest of Imoinda. Oroonoko is the prince of Coramantien, who is sold into slavery in Surinam by European slave traders. Oroonoko later leads a slave revolt and is killed by his slave masters.
* Caesar – the English name that Oroonoko is given after he is sold into slavery. After Oroonoko&#x27;s purchase, he is exclusively referred to by this name for the remainder of the text.
* Imoinda – The love interest of Oroonoko. After Oroonoko takes her virginity, the King of Coramantien sells her into slavery. Imoinda and Oroonoko eventually end up on the same plantation, marry, and have children. Imoinda&#x27;s pregnancy is the impetus for their slave revolt, and she is eventually killed by Oroonoko.
* Clemene – The English name that Imoinda is given after she is sold into slavery. Imoinda is mostly referred to as Clemene after her purchase, but at the end of the text she is once again addressed as Imoinda.
* King of Coramantien – The elderly king and grandfather of Oroonoko. He hears rumors of Imoinda and takes her as a member of his harem. After Oroonoko takes Imoinda&#x27;s virginity, the king sells her into slavery and lies to Oroonoko, telling him that she was instead executed.
* Aboan – A friend of Oroonoko&#x27;s from Coramantien. He helps Oroonoko visit Imoinda after she is forced into the king&#x27;s harem.
* Onahal – An older women in the king&#x27;s harem. She helps Oroonoko visit Imoinda after Imoinda is forced into the king&#x27;s harem.
* Tuscan – A fellow slave to Oronokoo. He plays a vital role in the slave resistance against Governor Byam.
* Governor Byam – the governor of Surinam and the owner of the plantation that Oroonoko and Imoinda are living on. He is expected to free Oroonoko and Imoinda, but never arrives.
* Trefrey – the slave owner that eventually purchases both Oroonoko and Imoinda.

==Themes==
===Kingship===
Aphra Behn herself held incredibly strong pro-monarchy views that carried over into her writing of &quot;Oroonoko&quot;. The idea that Behn attempts to present within the work is that the idea of royalty and natural kingship can exist even within a society of slaves. Although Oroonoko himself is a native who later becomes a slave, he possesses the traits of those typically required of a king within a typically civilized society. He is admired and respected by those who follow him, and even in death he keeps his royal dignity intact—as he would rather be executed by his owners than surrender his self-respect. Oroonoko&#x27;s death can be viewed as being unjustified and outrageous as the death of any king would be when caused by those who fall below him, as even though the whites are the ones who enslaved him, they are portrayed as being the ones who are the true animals.

===Female narrative===
The unnamed female narrator of the story serves as being a strong reflection of a woman&#x27;s role in society throughout the 18th century, as well as being a reflection of Behn&#x27;s own personal views regarding the major themes within her work. Women within this time period were most often expected to remain silent and on the sidelines, simply observing rather than actively contributing, and the narrator in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is a portrayal of that. A female narrator is also a way to voice the real world disagreements over women&#x27;s rights, as well as slavery, to the fictional story. The narrator&#x27;s disgust surrounding the treatment of Oroonoko, as well as her inability to watch his murder, is a way in which Behn inserts her own voice and viewpoints into the story, as her feelings towards kingship, slavery and the slave trade have been established. Likewise, the narrator&#x27;s relatively inactive involvement in the story could also be viewed as a reflection of the way in which female writers of the time were viewed as well—silent and non contributing due to their male peers—especially with Behn herself being one of very few female authors of the time.

===Slavery and servitude===
The view of slavery and other forms of forced servitude in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; is intentionally mixed. While Oroonoko himself is shown as wrongly imprisoned by the whims and cruelty of his European captors, the character himself comes out in direct support of slavery multiple times throughout the text. Slavery is depicted as a natural order of things, the weak overcoming the strong and using these lower people as tools in order to conduct busywork such as manual labor and chores in order to free the betters of society into perusing the more important work that must be done. Oroonoko goes from being a warrior and prominent figure in his society to being captured and turned to slavery at his own expense. Oroonoko is seen as unjustly held in bondage as a singular entity rather than as a moral imperative for the evils of slavery in itself.

===Gender roles===
Despite having little dialogue in &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, Imoinda is a multifaceted character; she exhibits both traditionally feminine and masculine traits. On one hand, Imoinda is characterized as submissive and frail, for instance, when she faints into Oroonoko&#x27;s arms on two occasions. However, when the slaves make an effort to escape from their masters, Imoinda acts as a heroine and injures one of the slave masters that chased after them.

==Women==
===Author===
As a member of the &quot;British female transatlantic experience&quot; and an early canonical female author, Aphra Behn&#x27;s writings have been the subject of various feminist analyses in the years since &quot;Oroonoko&quot;&#x27;s publication. Through the eponymous Oroonoko, and other periphery male characters, masculinity is equated with dominance throughout the text, a dominance which is supplemented by feminine power in the form of strong female characters. Behn challenges the predetermined patriarchal norm of favoring the literary merit of male writers simply because of their elite role in society. In her time, Behn&#x27;s success as a female author enabled the proliferation of respect and high readership for up-and-coming women writers.

As an author who did not endure the brutality of slavery, Behn is considered a duplicitous narrator with dual perspectives according to research from G.A. Starr&#x27;s &quot;Aphra Behn and the Genealogy of the Man of Feeling&quot;. Throughout Behn&#x27;s early life and literary career, Starr notes that &quot;Behn was in a good position to analyze such a predicament... as a woman-single, poor, unhealthy-supporting herself by writing, and probably a Roman Catholic, she knew about marginality and vulnerability&quot;. As evident in this excerpt, Behn&#x27;s attitude towards the &quot;predicament&quot; of slavery remained ambiguous throughout &quot;Oroonoko,&quot; due in part to her identity and inexperience with racial discrimination. Despite the fact that this story is told through Behn&#x27;s perspective as a marginalized female author in a male-dominated literary canon, the cultural complexities of the institution of slavery are still represented through the lens of an outside source.

Throughout the novella, Behn identifies with Oroonoko&#x27;s strength, courage, and intelligence but also includes herself in the same categorization of the higher European power structure. For example, in Albert Rivero&#x27;s &quot;Aphra Behn&#x27;s &#x27;Oroonoko&#x27; and the &#x27;Blank Spaces&#x27; of Colonial Fictions,&quot; the author gives context to &quot;Oroonoko&quot; within a greater body of colonial fictions. Rivero describes Behn&#x27;s novella as &quot;the romance of decorous, upper class sentiments&quot;. The multi-layered components of Behn&#x27;s publication parallel her ever-changing perception of racial tension throughout the novella. Behn as a duplicitous narrator plays into the ambiguity of her support for abolition, mixed with the control afforded to her because of her race and economic status.

===Imoinda===
Imoinda serves as a strong female character in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; due in part to Behn&#x27;s emphasis on Imoinda&#x27;s individuality. Behn&#x27;s depiction of Imoinda is mostly unrelated to the central plot point within the text; the protagonist&#x27;s journey of self-discovery&quot;.&quot; During the era in which the work was written, male heroism dominated the literary field. Most often, protagonist roles were designated to male characters, and with this, the voice of the female remained silent. In this sense, Behn&#x27;s characterization of Imoinda as a fighter and a lively autonomous woman, despite the cultural climate of slavery and the societal norm to view females as accessories, prompted a sense of female liberation.

Behn&#x27;s novel awakens the voice of the female that deserves more recognition in literature. Imoinda is Oroonoko&#x27;s love interest in the novel, but this is not all she is. Rather than falling into the role of the typical submissive female, Imoinda frequently displays that she is strong enough to fight alongside Oroonoko, exemplified by her killing of the governor (Behn 68&quot;)&quot;. Imoinda is portrayed as Oroonoko&#x27;s equal in the work; where Oroonoko is described as &quot;Mars&quot; (16), Imoinda is described as &quot;the beautiful black Venus&quot; (16). Ultimately, their strengths of aggression and beauty are exemplified through mythological parallels. Comparisons with Mars, the God of war, in the beginning of the novella provides a framework for Oroonoko&#x27;s rise as an admired warrior, while Imoinda&#x27;s relation to divinity is more feminine from the start, drawing a connection between her appearance, and that of the powerful Venus, goddess of love and beauty in Roman myth. Imoinda being compared to a goddess of love is fitting of her character, for through reading the novella, readers can easily see that she is a character that is driven by love, particularly hers for Oroonoko. She fights alongside her husband to free themselves from slavery, and to obtain a better life for both themselves and their unborn child. By the end of her life, Imoinda obediently accepts her death at the hands of her husband, along with that of her unborn child, out of love, admiration, and respect for Oroonoko.

By paralleling Imoinda with a Roman goddess, she is given an air of prominence and power, a revolutionary concept in literature at the time. Behn herself was a revolutionary part of seventeenth-century literature, as she played the role of a female author, narrator, and character. Behn bases the story upon her trip to Surinam and, in the beginning of the text, she makes it clear that it is a &quot;true story&quot;, presenting &quot;Oroonoko&quot; as both an anti-slavery and proto-feminist narrative combined.

In regards to Imoinda, In &quot;The White Female as Effigy and the Black Female as Surrogate in Janet. Schaw&#x27;s Journal of a Lady of Quality and Jane Austen&#x27;s Mansfield Park&quot; by David S. Wallace, &quot;MacDonald emphasizes the whitening of the character of Imoinda--Oroonoko&#x27;s wife--in every adaptation of the novella.&quot; Wallace also discusses how Imoinda is hypersexualized in this novel to desexualize white women. Wallace writes: &quot;At least a few white, female authors became agents in this desexualization of white women and hyper-sexualization of their black counterparts.&quot;

==Adaptation==

&quot;Oroonoko&quot; was not a very substantial success at first. Behn, who had hoped to recoup a significant amount of money from the book, was disappointed. Sales picked up in the second year after her death, and the novel then went through three printings. The story was used by Thomas Southerne for a tragedy entitled &quot;Oroonoko: A Tragedy.&quot; Southerne&#x27;s play was staged in 1695 and published in 1696, with a foreword in which Southerne expresses his gratitude to Behn and praises her work. The play was a great success. After the play was staged, a new edition of the novel appeared, and it was never out of print in the 18th century afterward. The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, with one significant exception: it makes Imoinda white instead of black (see Macdonald), and therefore, like &quot;Othello,&quot; the male lead would perform in blackface to a white heroine. As the taste of the 1690s demanded, Southerne emphasises scenes of pathos, especially those involving the tragic heroine, such as the scene where Oroonoko kills Imoinda. At the same time, in standard Restoration theatre rollercoaster manner, the play intersperses these scenes with a comic and sexually explicit subplot. The subplot was soon cut from stage representations with the changing taste of the 18th century, but the tragic tale of Oroonoko and Imoinda remained popular on the stage. William Ansah Sessarakoo reportedly left a mid-century performance in tears.

Through the eighteenth century, Southerne&#x27;s version of the story was more popular than Behn&#x27;s, and in the nineteenth century, when Behn was considered too indecent to be read, the story of Oroonoko continued in the highly pathetic and touching Southerne adaptation. The killing of Imoinda, in particular, was a popular scene. It is the play&#x27;s emphasis on, and adaptation to, tragedy that is partly responsible for the shift in interpretation of the novel from Tory political writing to prescient &quot;novel of compassion&quot;. When Roy Porter writes of &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, &quot;the question became pressing: what should be done with noble savages? Since they shared a universal human nature, was not civilization their entitlement,&quot; he is speaking of the way that the novel was cited by anti-slavery forces in the 1760s, not the 1690s, and Southerne&#x27;s dramatic adaptation is significantly responsible for this change of focus.

In the eighteenth century, Oroonoko appears in various German plays:
* Anonymous: &quot;Oronocko, oder Der moralisirende&quot; [!] &quot;Wilde&quot; (1757)
* Klinger, Friedrich Maximilian: &quot;Der Derwisch. Eine Komödie in fünf Aufzügen&quot; (1780)
* Dalberg, Wolfgang Heribert Freiherr von: &quot;Oronooko ein Trauerspiel in fünf Handlungen&quot; (1786) (an adaptation of Behn)
* Schönwärt: &quot;Oronooko, Prinz von Kandien. Trauerspiel in 5 Aufzügen&quot; (1780?)

The work was rewritten in the twenty-first century as &quot;IMOINDA Or She Who Will Lose Her Name&quot; (2008) by Professor Joan Anim-Addo. The rewriting focuses on the story of Imoinda.

In 2012, a play by Biyi Bandele based on &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place.

<text>Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery is a large museum and art gallery in Bristol, England. The museum is situated in Clifton, about from the city centre. As part of Bristol Culture it is run by the Bristol City Council with no entrance fee. It holds designated museum status, granted by the national government to protect outstanding museums. The designated collections include: geology, Eastern art, and Bristol&#x27;s history, including English delftware. In January 2012 it became one of sixteen Arts Council England Major Partner Museums.

The museum includes sections on natural history as well as local, national and international archaeology. The art gallery contains works from all periods, including many by internationally famous artists, as well a collection of modern paintings of Bristol.

In the summer of 2009 the museum hosted an exhibition by Banksy featuring more than 70 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet. It was developed in secrecy and with no advance publicity, but soon gained worldwide attention.

The building is of Edwardian Baroque architecture and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.

The standard opening hours are: Tuesday to Sunday, 10am–5pm. The museum is also open 10am–5pm on Bank Holiday Mondays and Mondays during Bristol school holidays.

==Events==

Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery run a programme of free and paid events throughout the year that include multi week exhibitions, workshops and drop in gallery curator talks. The biggest annual event is the weekend celebration for Chinese New Year during February which has dancing dragon and lion performances, martial arts, traditional Chinese dances, storytelling, family trails, arts and craft activities. Information on current and past events can be found on the museum&#x27;s website.

==History==


The Museum and Art Gallery&#x27;s origins lie in the foundation, in 1823, of the Bristol Institution for the Advancement of Science and Art, sharing brand-new premises at the bottom of Park Street (about downhill from the current site) with the slightly older Bristol Literary and Philosophical Society. The neoclassical building was designed by Sir Charles Robert Cockerell (1788–1863), who was later to complete the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and build St. George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, and was later used as the Freemasons Hall.

In April 1871 the Bristol Institution merged with the Bristol Library Society and on 1 April 1872 a new combined museum and library building in Venetian Gothic style was opened at the top of Park Street. The lease on the former Bishop&#x27;s College building next door, which had been the Library Society&#x27;s home since 1855, passed to the local army reserve unit, whose drill hall lay behind it; it became the Victoria (later Salisbury) Club and a restaurant. The old Institution building was sold to the Freemasons. Although the new building was extended in 1877, by the 1890s the Museum and Library Association was struggling financially, and even unable to pay its curator, Edward Wilson (1848–1898). Negotiations with the city corporation culminated in the transfer of the whole organisation and premises to Bristol city corporation on 31 May 1894. Wilson remained Curator until his death – only this time he was actually paid!

However, in June 1899 the site of the Salisbury Club was offered for sale to the city, the tobacco baron, Sir William Henry Wills (1830–1911, later Lord Winterstoke) offering £10,000 to help buy the site and build a new City Art Gallery on it. Designed by Frederick Wills in an Edwardian Baroque style work on the new building started in 1901, and opened in February 1905. It was built in a rectangular open plan in 2 sections each consisting of a large hall with barrel-vaulted glazed roofs, separated by a double staircase. It incorporated a Museum of Antiquities, as it had been decided during the planning stage that Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities should be grouped with art in the new structure, rather than remaining with the natural history collections that remained in the old building. Stone tools continued to reside with the geology collections within natural history. Yet more space became available to museum displays when Bristol Central Library moved down the hill to College Green in 1906. The vacant rooms were reconstructed as invertebrate and biology galleries.

In 1913, the army reserve&#x27;s drill hall, which now lay between the rear of the Art Gallery and the rapidly expanding University of Bristol, was purchased by the two institutions, three-fifths of the complex falling to the Museum and Art Gallery, the rest to the University. Unfortunately, the outbreak of war in 1914 put paid to any plans for new building; indeed, the Upper Museum Room (geology) was cleared in 1916 to become a &#x27;Soldiers Room&#x27; to entertain convalescents and the Egyptian Room &#x27;served for reading and writing and for the delivery of special demonstrations. However, after being used for storage for over a decade, it proved possible to demolish the Drill Hall to permit a rearward extension of the Art Gallery. This was funded by Sir George Alfred Wills (1854–1928, a cousin of Lord Winterstoke) and completed in 1930.

The 1872–77 Museum building was gutted by fire following a bomb hit on the night of 24–25 November 1940, during the Bristol Blitz, some 17,000 of the natural history specimens being lost. The 1930 extension of the Art Gallery was also hit, but luckily escaped the conflagration, although suffering badly from blast damage. Nevertheless, the Art Gallery partially reopened in February 1941, now also housing some of the Museum&#x27;s surviving material on a &#x27;temporary&#x27; basis. Although now housed in the same building, from April 1945, the Museum and Art Gallery were formally split into separate institutions with the lower floor becoming the Museum and the upper floors the Art Gallery. As part of this restructuring, the archaeology and anthropology collections were transferred from the Art Gallery to the Museum.

In February 1947, the remains of the old Museum building (with the exception of the undamaged lecture theatre) were sold to Bristol University: it was then rebuilt as its dining rooms, later becoming Brown&#x27;s Restaurant. The sale of the building in 1947 reflected the intention that new premises would soon be provided for the Museum and the Art Gallery; planning began in 1951, but then dragged on for the next twenty years, during which time the old buildings received minimal attention, other than the insertion of mezzanines to gain additional space.

Meanwhile, various proposals had been made for new museum buildings in Castle Park, in the very centre of Bristol, overlooking the river Avon. However, spiraling costs and funding difficulties meant that in 1971 the plans were abandoned and a smaller amount of money was put into upgrading the existing building. Wholesale refurbishment was required, including rewiring, rearranging offices, creating laboratories and dividing up and furnishing the basement to provide proper storage for the reserve collections.

In the summer of 2009 the museum hosted an exhibition by Banksy, called Banksy versus Bristol Museum featuring more than 70 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet. It was developed in secrecy and with no advance publicity.

==Collection==

Today, the top floor art galleries include a collection of Chinese Glass and the &quot;Schiller collection&quot; of Eastern Art bequeathed by Max Schiler, the Recorder of Bristol from 1935 to 1946 and collected by his older brother Ferdinand N Schiler. It contains a range of Chinese ceramics wares spanning different dynastic periods. Particularly fine pieces include a number of white, light blue and green-glazed (Ying Qing and Qingbai) wares from the Tang (AD 618–960) and Song (AD 960–1279) dynasties. It also holds a collection of Bristol blue glass.

The Egyptology gallery contains mummies besides other items and a wall decoration made over 3,000 years ago – the Assyrian Reliefs, which were transferred from the Royal West of England Academy. It also has a significant collection of Egyptian antiquities, a considerable number derived from the excavations of the Egypt Exploration Society – such as the stela of Meni – and British School of Archaeology in Egypt. A completely rebuilt Egyptian gallery opened in 2007.

A natural history gallery contains examples of aquatic habitats in the south west of England and an interactive map of local wildlife sites and a freshwater aquarium containing fish typical of the region.

The museum also holds many of the prehistoric and Roman artefacts recovered before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake, and other local archaeological finds such as those from Pagans Hill Roman Temple and the Orpheus Mosaic from Newton St Loe.

There is a choice of galleries situated upstairs full of artworks: Old Masters, French School, British Collection, Modern Art and the Bristol School.

In 2012, the museum was given the entire 50,000 piece collection of the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum.

==Friends organisations==
The Friends of Bristol Art Gallery has supported the gallery since 1947, acquiring over 300 works of art for the gallery. The Friends of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery was founded in 1977 (first known as the “Bristol Magpies”) to support the principal sites of Bristol’s museums, galleries and archives service.

==Future development==

On 1 July 2014 Arts Council England announced that Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives secured its second &#x27;Major partner museum&#x27; funding for 2015-18 which will see the service receive approximately £4.7 million over three years to help deliver public outcomes.

==Related museums and sites==
Other museums and sites administered by Bristol Culture are M Shed, Blaise Castle House Museum, the Red Lodge Museum, the Georgian House Museum, Bristol Archives and Kings Weston Roman Villa. The Bristol Industrial Museum, which closed in 2006 reopened in June 2011 as a museum called M Shed dedicated to telling the story of Bristol.

<doc id="1003480" wikidata="Q662745" url="?curid=1003480" title="Historicity of King Arthur">
<text>The historicity of King Arthur has been debated both by academics and popular writers. While there have been many claims that King Arthur was a real historical person, the current consensus among specialists on the period holds him to be a mythological or folkloric figure. 

The first definite mention of Arthur appears circa 828 in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, where he is presented as a military leader fighting against the invading Saxons in 5th- to 6th-century Sub-Roman Britain at the Battle of Badon, written more than three centuries after the events depicted. He develops into a legendary figure in the Matter of Britain from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s influential but largely fictional &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;.

Historians propose a variety of possible sources for the myth of Arthur, perhaps as a composite character. Historical figures involved in such theories include Artuir mac Áedán, a son of the 6th-century king of Dál Riata in modern Scotland; Ambrosius Aurelianus, who led a Romano-British resistance against the Saxons; Lucius Artorius Castus, a 2nd-century Roman commander of Sarmatian cavalry; and the British king Riothamus, who fought alongside the last Gallo-Roman commanders against the Visigoths in an expedition to Gaul in the 5th century. Others include the Welsh kings Owain Danwyn, Enniaun Girt, and Athrwys ap Meurig.

==Historiography==
Until the late 20th century, there was academic debate about the historicity of Arthur among historians and archaeologists. In the 21st century, the academic consensus rejects it.

In 1936, R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres treated Arthur as a Roman &quot;comes Britanniarum&quot;. They asserted that &quot;the historicity of [Arthur] can hardly be called into question&quot;, though they were careful to separate the historical Arthur from the legendary Arthur.

In 1971, Leslie Alcock claimed to &quot;demonstrate that there is acceptable historical evidence that Arthur was a genuine historical figure, not a mere figment of myth or romance&quot;. Also in 1971, while conceding that Gildas does not mention Arthur, Frank Stenton wrote that this &quot;may suggest that the Arthur of history was a less imposing figure than the Arthur of legend&quot; but then argued that &quot;it should not be allowed to remove him from the sphere of history.&quot; In 1977, John Morris argued in favour, but his work was widely criticised at the time as having &quot;grave methodological flaws&quot;. David Dumville took the opposite position in the same year: &quot;The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books.&quot;

By 1986, Myres, who had written in 1936 (with Collingwood) that Arthur was historical, said &quot;It is inconceivable that Gildas ... should not have mentioned Arthur&#x27;s part ...&quot; (that is, if he had existed) and complains that &quot;No figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian’s time.&quot; By 1991, the &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain&quot; stated that &quot;historians are tending to take a minimal view of the historical value of even the earliest evidence for Arthur, but most probably still see him as an historical figure ...&quot; while &quot;the chivalric Arthur ... was essentially the creation of Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth century.&quot;

In 2003, Thomas Charles-Edwards&#x27; book on the period only mentioned Arthur in the context of a later Welsh story. In 2004, Francis Pryor dismissed the evidence that Arthur existed but says that proving he did not exist is as impossible as proving that he did. In 2007, O. J. Padel in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; described Arthur as a &quot;legendary warrior and supposed king of Britain&quot;. He was less dismissive in 2014, describing Arthur as &quot;originally legendary or historical&quot;, but also cited the failure of the tenth century Welsh poem &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, which prophesied the expulsion of the English from Britain, to mention Arthur among the ancient heroes who would return to lead the resistance.

In a 2007 review, Howard Wiseman followed Sheppard Frere (1967), saying that &quot;the evidence &quot;allows&quot;, not &quot;requires&quot; belief&quot;, and follows Christopher Snyder (2000) in emphasising the need for a better understanding of the period, regardless of whether Arthur existed. In 2011, Robin Fleming&#x27;s history of the period did not mention Arthur at all. In 2013, Guy Halsall reported that &quot;among the academic community, the sceptics have decisively carried the day&quot;. In 2018, Nicholas J. Higham refuted all the outstanding claims for a historical Arthur, summarising his position as: &quot;That Arthur has produced extraordinary quantities of &#x27;smoke&#x27; is in large part because he is so well suited to be a fulcrum of make-believe. But there is no historical &#x27;fire&#x27; underlying the stories that congregated around him, just &#x27;highland mist&#x27;.&quot; His book has been generally praised.

In a 2018 review, Tom Shippey summarised the situation as &quot;modern academic historians want nothing to do with King Arthur.&quot; In a 2019 review, Brian David reported that &quot;Few topics in late antique and medieval history elicit scholarly groans quite like the idea of a supposedly &#x27;factual&#x27; King Arthur. Yet historians and other scholars made cases for Arthur’s existence in historical and literary studies until the 1980s. For academics today, the question of the realism of King Arthur has been largely banished to popular books, video games, and movies.&quot;

Andrew Breeze argued in 2015 and 2020 that Arthur was historical, and claims to have identified the locations of his battles as well as the place and date of his death. However, his conclusions were disputed.

== Etymology of &quot;Arthur&quot; ==
The origin of the name Arthur is unclear. One proposed etymology is from the Roman family name Artorius, itself of obscure and contested etymology, possibly of Messapic or Etruscan origin. Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur&#x27;s name only appears as &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Arthurus&quot;, or &quot;Arturus&quot; in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as &quot;Artōrius&quot; (although the Classical Latin &quot;Artōrius&quot; became &quot;Arturius&quot; in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, it may not refer to the origin of the name &quot;Arthur&quot;, as &quot;Artōrius&quot; would regularly become &quot;Art(h)ur&quot; when borrowed into Welsh.

According to linguist and Celticist Stephan Zimmer, it is possible that Artorius has a Celtic origin, being a Latinization of the hypothetical name &quot;*Artorījos&quot; derived from the patronym &quot;*Arto-rīg-ios&quot;, meaning &quot;Son of the Bear&quot; or &quot;Warrior-King&quot;. &quot;*Arto-rīg-ios&quot; is unattested, but the root &quot;*arto-rīg&quot; is the source of the Old Irish personal name &quot;Artrí&quot;. 

John Morris argued that the appearance of the name &quot;Arthur&quot; among Scottish and Welsh figures suggests the name became popular in early 6th-century Britain for a short time. He proposed all such occurrences were due to the importance of another Arthur who may have ruled temporarily as Emperor of Britain, and suggested a period of Saxon advance was halted and turned back before resuming in the 570s.

==Early sources==
===Gildas and Badon===
Arthur is not mentioned in Gildas&#x27; 6th-century book &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. Gildas does mention a British victory against the Saxons at the &quot;Badonic mount&quot; (&quot;mons Badonicus&quot;), which occurred in the year of Gildas&#x27; birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the Battle of Badon. Gildas describes the battle as taking place &quot;in our times&quot; and being one of the &quot;latest, if not the greatest&quot; slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle&#x27;s location as Badon, such as in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.

Gildas&#x27; Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss Ambrosius Aurelianus as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior, but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius&#x27; victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.

===&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;===
Arthur is also not mentioned in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, attributed to a Welsh ecclesiastic called Nennius. The &quot;Historia&quot; says: &quot;Then in those days Arthur fought with the kings of the Britons against them [the Saxons] but he himself was the commander of battles (&quot;dux bellorum&quot;)&quot;. Twelve battles fought by Arthur are listed. Commenting on Arthur&#x27;s post-Conquest portrayal as a king, the historian Nicholas Higham observes &quot;Earlier texts are uniform in depicting Arthur solely as a warrior or a leader of warriors, whether ‘real’ or supernatural ... In the context of the central Middle Ages, it was a king&#x27;s role to head the army, leading the forces of subaltern rulers. ‘Overkingship’ was well known, in Wales as elsewhere. It was a small step therefore from ‘commander of battles’ to a quasi-imperial figure commanding the Welsh kings as well as their forces. This was to prove a landmark shift within the Arthurian tradition, leading directly to &#x27;King&#x27; Arthur.&quot;

===&quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;===
The earliest version of the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (&quot;Welsh Annals&quot;) was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur&#x27;s death as occurring in 537 at the Battle of Camlann. Like the &quot;Annals&quot;, all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.

===&quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot;===
Arthur appears briefly in the &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Kings of the English&quot;) by William of Malmesbury in 1124. Despite its name, the work attempted to reconstruct British history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and various chroniclers. The work considered Arthur as historical and featured Ambrosius Aurelianus as his apparent employer. Malmesbury also mentioned the finding of a tomb of a certain &quot;Walwin&quot; (a supposed nephew of Arthur) in the time of William the Conqueror.

===&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;===
Arthur was first styled as a king of the Britons in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudo-historical chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), which dates to c. 1136. Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of Uther Pendragon, father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur. He identifies Aurelius Ambrosius as the son of Constantinus, a Breton ruler and brother of Aldroenus.

===Hagiographies===
Arthur is mentioned in several 12th- to 13th-century hagiographies of Welsh and Breton saints, including those of Cadoc, Carantoc, Gildas, Goeznovius, Illtud, and Paternus. The &quot;Legenda Sancti Goeznovii&quot; is a hagiography of the Breton saint Goeznovius which was formerly dated to c. 1019 but is now dated to the late 12th to early 13th century. It includes a brief segment dealing with Arthur and a leader known as Vortigern.

===Bardic sources===
There are a number of mentions of a legendary hero called Arthur in early Welsh and Breton poetry. These sources are preserved in High Medieval manuscripts and cannot be dated with accuracy. They are mostly placed in the 9th to 10th century, although some authors have dated them to as early as the 7th century. The earliest of these would appear to be the Old Welsh poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, preserved in a 13th-century manuscript. It refers to a warrior who &quot;glutted black ravens [i.e., killed many men] on the rampart of the stronghold, although he was no Arthur.&quot;

The Welsh poem &quot;Geraint, son of Erbin&quot; describes a battle at a port-settlement and mentions Arthur in passing. The work is a praise-poem and elegy for King Geraint, usually presumed to be a historical king of Dumnonia, and is significant in showing that he was associated with Arthur at a relatively early date. It also provides the earliest known reference to Arthur as &quot;emperor&quot;. &quot;Geraint, son of Erbin&quot; is found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, compiled around 1250, though the poem itself may date to the 10th or 11th century. &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; was similarly copied around the same time. The two poems differ in the relative archaic quality of their language, that of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; being the older in form. However, this could merely reflect differences in the date of the last revision of the language within the two poems, as the language would have had to have been revised for the poems to remain comprehensible.

==Alternative candidates for the historical King Arthur==
Some theories suggest that &quot;Arthur&quot; was a byname of attested historical individuals.

===Lucius Artorius Castus and the Sarmatian connection===
One theory suggests that Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman military commander who served in Britain in the late 2nd century or early 3rd century, was a prototype of Arthur. Artorius is known from two inscriptions that give details about his service. After a long career as a centurion in the Roman army, he was promoted to prefect of Legio VI Victrix, a legion headquartered in Eboracum (present-day York, England). He later commanded two British legions on an expedition against either the Armoricans (in present-day Brittany) or the Armenians. He subsequently became civilian governor of Liburnia in modern Croatia, where he died.

Kemp Malone first made the connection between Artorius and King Arthur in 1924. Noting that the Welsh name &quot;Arthur&quot; plausibly derives from the Latin &quot;Artorius&quot;, Malone suggested that certain details of Castus&#x27; biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s depiction of King Arthur. Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur&#x27;s story are open to interpretation.

Malone&#x27;s idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the &quot;Sarmatian connection&quot;. In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of Sarmatian cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the Knights of the Round Table. Nickel wrote that Castus&#x27; Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the Caucasus region. He suggested that the Sarmatians&#x27; descendants kept Castus&#x27; legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.

Independently of Nickel, C. Scott Littleton developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, &quot;From Scythia to Camelot&quot;. Littleton and Malcor argued that Artorius and the Sarmatian cavalry were the inspiration for King Arthur and his knights, but that many elements of Arthur&#x27;s story derive from Caucasian mythology, ostensibly brought to Britain in the 2nd century by Sarmatians and Alans. They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the Sword in the Stone, the Holy Grail, and the return of Arthur&#x27;s sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to Batraz and his Narts, the heroes of the legends of the North Caucasus.

Some Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence. Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century. Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later. As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century. Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film &quot;King Arthur&quot;.

===Riothamus===

Riothamus (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as &quot;a king of the Britons&quot;. He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the Byzantine historian Jordanes&#x27; &quot;The Origin and Deeds of the Goths&quot;, written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.

About 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop Sidonius Apollinaris sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in Armorica; this letter still survives. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius began a campaign against Euric, king of the Visigoths who were campaigning outside their territory in Gaul. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers into the land of the Bituriges, likely to Avaricum (Bourges). The location of Riothamus&#x27; army was betrayed to the Visigoths by Arvandus, the jealous praetorian prefect of Gaul, and Euric defeated him in the Battle of Déols. Riothamus was last seen retreating northwest to Burgundy.

Geoffrey Ashe points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to Avalon (called &quot;insula Auallonis&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at Déols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic Burgundians, perhaps passing through a town called Avallon (which was within Burgundian territory and not far from Bourges).

It is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus &quot;crossed the ocean&quot;, so it is possible that both are correct. The name &quot;Riothamus&quot; is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning &quot;High King&quot;, though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or Gauls, and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names. Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (&quot;Riatav&quot;/&quot;Riadaf&quot;) and Old Breton (&quot;Riatam&quot;); all are derived from Common Brittonic &quot;*Rigotamos&quot;, meaning &#x27;Most Kingly&#x27; or &#x27;Kingliest&#x27;.

===Ambrosius Aurelianus===
According to Gildas, Ambrosius Aurelianus (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful Romano-British leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill or that the battle was a continuation of his efforts.

Scholars such as Léon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot&#x27;s hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend. Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called &quot;king&quot; until the somewhat-legendary &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

===Artuir mac Áedán===
Artuir mac Áedán was the eldest son of Áedán mac Gabráin, an Irish king of Dál Riata (in present-day south-west Scotland) in the late 6th century. Artuir never himself became king of Dál Riata; his brother Eochaid Buide ruled after their father&#x27;s death. However, Artuir became a war leader when Áedán gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though Áedán was officially still king. Thus it was Artuir who led the Scoti of Dál Riata in a war against the Picts, separate from the later war with Northumbria. 

That Artuir is the historical basis of the mythical King Arthur has been proposed by both David F. Carroll and Michael Wood. Under this hypothesis, Artuir was predominantly active in the region between Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the Antonine Wall, the kingdom of the Gododdin. However, he was ultimately killed in battle in 596 – thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

== Notes ==

: For example, Artúr mac Conaing, who may have been named after his uncle Artúr mac Áedáin. Artúr son of Bicoir &quot;the Briton&quot; was another reported in this period, who slew Mongán mac Fiachnai of Ulster in 620/625 in Kintyre. A man named Feradach, apparently the grandson of one Artuir, was a signatory at the synod that enacted the Law of Adomnan in 697. Arthur ap Pedr was a prince in Dyfed, born around 570–580.

<text>Trzemeszno is a town in Gniezno County in Greater Poland Voivodeship, west-central Poland. It is situated on the eastern shore of the Popielewskie Lake, and is one of the oldest settlements in the region.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name derives from an Old Polish word &quot;Trzemcha&quot; meaning the flower of the &quot;Bird’s Cherry&quot; plant, which once grew in the vicinity.

==History==

Around the 10th century, a kind of defensive settlement was created here. It soon changed its function into a market settlement. It was significant that the town lay on the trade route joining Greater Poland with northern Masovia and Pomerelia.

In the 12th century, Trzemeszno became a property of the monastery of Canons regular of St. Augustine. The monks were brought there by Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. Trzemeszno received its town rights before 1382. It was a private church town, administratively located in the Gniezno County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

From the second half of the 17th century, there began a decline of the town caused by the Swedish invasion of Poland (Deluge) and plagues. In 1766, there were only 15 houses left in Trzemeszno. 
However, soon the town started to develop rapidly. An important period in town&#x27;s history is due to the activity of Michał Kościesza Kosmowski, who was the monastery abbot (1761–1804). He founded the &quot;New Town&quot; – a suburb, where cloth makers were settled, and St. Michael&#x27;s suburb for other craftsmen. Kosmowski founded also several buildings of public services: “Collegium Tremesnensis” a secondary school (currently &quot;Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Michała Kosmowskiego&quot;), hospital and a new brewery. The Polish patriot, Jan Kiliński, was born here in 1760. In 1791, there were 144 buildings in the town and almost 1,000 people lived there. The main activities of the residents were connected to crafts, trade and framing. The enterprise, which took up artistic challenges, was rebuilding and changing into baroque style of the monastery church. The work was finished in 1791 when the church was consecrated.

In 1793, during the Second Partition of Poland, Trzemeszno was annexed by Prussia. Following the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, it was re-annexed by Prussia and incorporated into the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (Poznań). In 1836 the Prussian government secularized the monastery. In 1848 Trzemeszno became one of the main centers of the Polish Greater Poland uprising against Prussia, and was the site of a battle, won by the Poles. The town&#x27;s residents (including many students) were also involved in the January Uprising (1863). Trzemeszno&#x27;s secondary school has traditions of participating in national liberation fights. In 1844, a secret society of students called “Sarmatia” formed and from 1861 the National Society “Zan” was active.
In 1865, a Loan Bank (Kasa Pożyczkowa) and in 1874 an Industrial Society (Towarzystwo Przemysłowe) were founded in Trzemeszno. The latter was significant for culture and education. Around 1880, a branch of Towarzystwo Czytelni Ludowych (&quot;Society of Public Reading Rooms&quot;) and in 1894 the Gymnastic Society &quot;Sokół&quot; were founded.

Opening a railway line in 1872 joining Trzemeszno with Poznań, Toruń and Inowrocław had contributed to the town&#x27;s development.

At the end of World War I, in the early days of the Greater Poland Uprising, the Polish residents of Trzemeszno took control of their town on 29 December 1918; the town was confirmed part of newly reconstituted Poland in the following months. Five insurgents from the town died in the uprising. The first years in free Poland were good for developing trade and crafts. However the situation was complicated by inflation, unemployment and economical crisis. Despite these problems, cultural and educational life flourished. Many events were organized by local societies and organizations. There was a cinema, and in 1937 the local weekly newspaper “Kosynier” began to be published. Secondary school played an important role in local culture.
During the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, it was the site of Polish defense, and on 11 September 1939 German troops carried out a massacre of dozens of Polish defenders in the town (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). Soon afterwards, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local notable Poles during the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; campaign. In late 1939, the occupiers carried out expulsions of Poles, mainly families of massacred Polish defenders and families of Poles who were murdered or deported to concentration camps during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Expelled Poles were deported to the General Government in the more eastern part of German-occupied Poland, while their houses, shops and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. The Germans renamed the town to &quot;Tremessen&quot;. A pre-war monument to Polish insurgents of the Greater Poland uprising was destroyed, and schools, libraries and the church were closed. However, terrorized residents did not remain passive. There were local units of the Home Army and Grey Ranks secret resistance organizations. Artur Baumgart, commander of the local Home Army unit, and organizers of the Grey Ranks unit were arrested by the Germans in 1942–1943, and eventually sentenced to death and executed. In Trzemeszno, Polish resistance members from other places were imprisoned and sentenced to death.
After 1945, residents of Trzemeszno faced many difficult tasks. &quot;Citizen Committees&quot; were responsible for restoring closed enterprises and community services. The greatest challenge was restoration of the basilica church and secondary school which had been burned down by retreating German troops.

Rapid development of Trzemeszno took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The largest enterprise, employing over 1,000 people, was Pomorskie Zakłady Materiałów Izolacyjnych “Izopol” (factory producing insulation materials). “Izopol” played an important role as a financial supporter and developer of the town.

In 1975–1998, it was administratively located in the Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. In 1999, due to the administrative reform of Poland, Trzemeszno became a part of the Gniezno powiat and the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

<doc id="1003483" wikidata="Q5383591" url="?curid=1003483" title="Epistemic theories of truth">
<text>In philosophy and epistemology, epistemic theories of truth are attempts to analyze the notion of truth in terms of epistemic notions such as knowledge, belief, acceptance, verification, justification, and perspective. 

A variety of such conceptions can be classified into verificationist theories, perspectivist or relativist theories, and pragmatic theories.

Verificationism is based on verifying propositions. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, truth. That is, truth is reducible to this process of verification.
According to perspectivism and relativism, a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. Roughly, a proposition is true relative to a perspective if and only if it is accepted, endorsed, or legitimated by that perspective.

Many authors writing on the topic of the notion of truth advocate or endorse combinations of the above positions. Each of these epistemic conceptions of truth can be subjected to various criticisms. Some criticisms apply across the board, while others are more specific.

==Verificationist views==
The two main kinds of verification philosophies are positivism and a-priorism.

In positivism, a proposition is meaningful, and thus capable of being true or false, if and only if it is verifiable by sensory experiences.

A-priorism, often used in the domains of logic and mathematics, holds a proposition true if and only if &quot;a priori&quot; reasoning can verify it. In the related certainty theory, associated with Descartes and Spinoza, a proposition is true if and only if it is known with certainty.

Logical positivism attempts to combine positivism with a version of a-priorism.

Another theory of truth that is related to a-priorism is the concept-containment theory of truth. The concept-containment theory of truth is the view that a proposition is true if and only if the concept of the predicate of the proposition is &quot;contained in&quot; the concept of the subject. For example, the proposition that bachelors are unmarried men is true, in this view, because the concept of the predicate (unmarried men) is contained in the concept of the subject (bachelor). A contemporary reading of the concept-containment theory of truth is to say that every true proposition is an analytically true proposition.

==Perspectivist views==
According to perspectivism and relativism, a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. The Sophists&#x27; relativist and Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy are some of the most famous examples of such perspectivism. There are three main versions of perspectivism, and some interesting subdivisions:

===Individualist perspectivism===
According to individualist perspectivism (also individual perspectivism) perspectives are the points of view of particular individual persons. So, a proposition is true for a person if and only if it is accepted or believed by that person (i.e., &quot;true for me&quot;).

===Collectivist perspectivism===
In collectivist perspectivism, perspectives are understood as collective (cultures-dependent).

There are, roughly, three versions of collectivism:

====Consensus====
A perspective is, roughly, the broad opinions, and perhaps norms and practices, of a community of people, perhaps all having some special feature in common. So, a proposition is true (for a community C) if, and only if, there is a consensus amongst the members of C for believing it.

====Power====
In the power-oriented view, a perspective is a community enforced by power, authority, military might, privilege, etc. So, a proposition is true if it &quot;makes us powerful&quot; or is &quot;produced by power&quot;, thus the slogan &quot;truth is power&quot;.

This view of truth as a political stake may be loosely associated with Martin Heidegger or with Michel Foucault&#x27;s specific analysis of historical and political discourse, as well as with some social constructivists.

However, the Nazi mysticism of a communitarian &quot;blood community&quot; conception radically differs from Heidegger or Foucault&#x27;s criticism of the notion of the individual or collective subject.

====Marxist====
Truth-generating perspectives are collective and opposed to, or engaged in a struggle against, power and authority. For example, the collective perspective of the &quot;proletariat&quot;. So, the proposition is true if it is the &quot;product of political struggle&quot; for the &quot;emancipation of the workers&quot; (Theodor Adorno). This view is again associated with some social constructivists (e.g., feminist epistemologists).

===Transcendental perspectivism===
According to transcendental perspectivism, a truth-conferring perspective is something transcendental, and outside immediate human reach. The idea is that there is a transcendental or ideal epistemic perspective and the truth is, roughly, what is accepted or recognized-as-true from that ideal perspective. There are two subvarieties of transcendental perspectivism:

====Coherentism====

The ideal epistemic perspective is the set of &quot;maximally coherent and consistent propositions&quot;. A proposition is true if and only if it is a member of this maximally coherent and consistent set of propositions (associated with several German and British 19th century idealists).

====Theological perspectivism====
Theological perspectivism is the idea that a proposition is true if and only if it agrees with the thoughts of God.

==Pragmatic views==
Although the pragmatic theory of truth is not strictly classifiable as an epistemic theory of truth, it does bear a relationship to theories of truth that are based on concepts of inquiry and knowledge.

The ideal epistemic perspective is that of &quot;completed science&quot;, which will appear in the (temporal) &quot;limit of scientific inquiry&quot;. A proposition is true if and only if, in the long run it will come to be accepted by a group of inquirers using scientific rational inquiry. This can also be modalized: a proposition is true if, and only if, in the long run it would come to be accepted by a group of inquirers, if they were to use scientific rational inquiry. This view is thus a modification of the consensus view. The consensus needs to satisfy certain constraints in order for the accepted propositions to be true. For example, the methods used must be those of scientific inquiry (criticism, observation, reproducibility, etc.). This &quot;modification&quot; of the consensus view is an appeal to the correspondence theory of truth, which is opposed to the consensus theory of truth. 

Long-run scientific pragmatism was defended by Charles Sanders Peirce. A variant of this viewpoint is associated with Jürgen Habermas, though he later abandoned it.

<text>Nielsen is a lunar impact crater on the Oceanus Procellarum. It is located north-east of Montes Agricola on the western hemisphere of the Moon. To the east-southeast is the crater Wollaston.

Nielsen is a bowl-shaped formation that lies astride a small ridge that runs north-northwestwards towards the Mons Rümker. The latter is an unusual raised formation of lunar domes.

In 1973, the crater was named jointly after the Danish astronomer Axel Nielsen (1902-1970) and the Danish–American physicist Harald Herborg Nielsen (1903-1973), by the IAU.

<doc id="1003497" wikidata="Q6213166" url="?curid=1003497" title="Joel Abbot (naval officer)">
<text>Joel Abbot (January 18, 1793 – December 14, 1855) was a U.S. naval officer who served notably in the War of 1812, and commanded a ship during Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s 1853-1854 visit to Japan. Commodore Joel Abbot was Admiral Perry&#x27;s second in command when they opened Japan in 1853–1854.

==Military career==
Abbot was born in Westford, Massachusetts on January 18, 1793, son of Joel and Lydia (Cummings) Abbot. He entered the Navy at the age of 19 as midshipman at the beginning of the War of 1812.

He served first on the frigate and next on Lake Champlain with Commodore Macdonough, who, when he asked Abbot if he were ready to die for his country received the reply &quot;Certainly, sir; that is what I came into the service for.&quot; For his success in this dangerous exploit, and for his bravery in the engagement at Cumberland Head on 11 September 1814, the young officer received a sword of honor from Congress and was commissioned a lieutenant. In 1818, he was given charge of the captured pirate ship &quot;Mariana&quot;.

Abbot was promoted to commander in 1838, and the following year was given command of the Boston Navy Yard until 1842.

In 1843 he took command of the sloop-of-war in Commodore Perry&#x27;s African Squadron.

On 3 October 1850, Abbot was promoted to captain. In 1852, he was made commander of the &quot;Macedonian&quot;, when Commodore Perry was entrusted with power to select the officers to accompany him on his famous Japan expedition, he chose Abbot to command the sailing frigate .

In 1854, he was appointed commodore of the East India Squadron. (At that time, commodore was the title of the commander of a squadron of ships, rather than a rank in the Navy.) He died in Hong Kong on December 14, 1855.

His remains were returned to the United States where he was buried in the Abbot family tomb in Warren, Rhode Island.

==Family life==
Abbot married Mary Wood in January 1820. After Mary&#x27;s untimely death, he married Laura Wheaton on November 29, 1825. He had 10 children by his two wives.

His son, Walter Abbot, served in the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander and died on active duty in 1873. Another son, Charles Wheaton Abbot, Sr., served in the Navy from 1856 to 1891 and rose to the rank of Pay Director (equivalent to the rank of captain) and was later promoted to rear admiral on the retired list.

Abbot&#x27;s grandson, Charles Wheaton Abbot Jr., was a career Army officer and rose to become the Adjutant General of Rhode Island with the rank of brigadier general. Both Walter Abbot and Charles Jr. were companions of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Namesakes==
Two ships of the US Navy were named in his honor.

Joel Abbot Camp 21 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War was named after him when it was founded in 1907 in Warren, Rhode Island. The camp was relocated to Newport in the mid-1990s and was active until 2012.

==Dates of rank==
*Midshipman - 18 June 1812 
*Lieutenant - 1 April 1818
*Commander - 8 December 1838 
*Captain - 3 October 1850
*Commodore - 6 September 1854

<text>Bianchini is a lunar impact crater that lies along the northern Jura Mountains that ring the Sinus Iridum, in the northwestern part of the near side of the Moon. It was named after Italian astronomer Francesco Bianchini. The impact of this crater near the edge of the Jura Mountains deposited some material into the Sinus Iridum floor.

The rim of this crater is not significantly worn, although there is a small crater along the inner side of the eastern rim. Within the inner wall is a somewhat irregular floor and a small cluster of ridges at the midpoint. Portions of the inner wall have slumped toward the floor along the northern edges.

Bianchini is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bianchini.

<doc id="1003514" wikidata="Q958954" url="?curid=1003514" title="Eboracum">
<text>Eboracum () was a fort and later a city in the Roman province of Britannia. In its prime it was the largest town in northern Britain and a provincial capital. The site remained occupied after the decline of the Western Roman Empire and ultimately developed into the present-day city of York, in North Yorkshire, England.

Two Roman emperors died in Eboracum: Septimius Severus in 211 AD, and Constantius Chlorus in 306 AD.

The first known recorded mention of Eboracum by name is dated , and is an address containing the settlement&#x27;s name, &quot;Eburaci&quot;, on a wooden stylus tablet from the Roman fortress of Vindolanda in what is now Northumberland. During the Roman period, the name was written both &quot;Eboracum&quot; and &quot;Eburacum&quot; (in nominative form).

The name &quot;Eboracum&quot; comes from the Common Brittonic &quot;*Eburākon&quot;, which means &quot;yew tree place&quot;. The word for &quot;yew&quot; was &quot;*ebura&quot; in Proto-Celtic (cf. Old Irish &quot;ibar&quot; &quot;yew-tree&quot;, (older &quot;iobhar&quot;), , &quot;alder buckthorn&quot;, &quot;alder buckthorn&quot;), combined with the proprietive suffix &quot;*-āko(n)&quot; &quot;having&quot; (cf. Welsh &quot;-og&quot;, Gaelic &quot;-ach&quot;) meaning &quot;yew tree place&quot; (cf. &quot;efrog&quot; in Welsh, &quot;eabhrach/iubhrach&quot; in Irish Gaelic and &quot;eabhrach/iobhrach&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, by which names the city is known in those languages). The name was then Latinized by replacing the Celtic neuter nominative ending &quot;-on&quot; by its Latin equivalent &quot;-um&quot;, a common use noted also in Gaul and Lusitania (Ebora Liberalitas Julia). Various place names, such as Évry, Ivry, Ivrey, Ivory and Ivrac in France would all come from &quot;*eburacon / *eburiacon&quot;; for example: Ivry-la-Bataille (Eure, &quot;Ebriaco&quot; in 1023–1033), Ivry-le-Temple (&quot;Evriacum&quot; in 1199), and Évry (Essonne, &quot;Everiaco&quot; in 1158).

Peter Schrijver has instead counter-argued that &quot;&quot;eburos&quot; did not mean yew tree&quot; and that the derivation from Latin &quot;ebur&quot; (ivory) instead refers to boar&#x27;s tusks.

==Origins==
The Roman conquest of Britain began in 43 AD, but advance beyond the Humber did not take place until the early 70s AD. This was because the people in the area, known as the Brigantes by the Romans, became a Roman client state. When Brigantian leadership changed, becoming more hostile to Rome, Roman general Quintus Petillius Cerialis led the Ninth Legion north from Lincoln across the Humber. Eboracum was founded in 71 AD when Cerialis and the Ninth Legion constructed a military fortress (&quot;castra&quot;) on flat ground above the River Ouse near its junction with the River Foss. In the same year, Cerialis was appointed Governor of Britain.

A legion at full strength at that time numbered some 5,500 men, and provided new trading opportunities for enterprising local people, who doubtless flocked to Eboracum to take advantage of them. As a result, permanent civilian settlement grew up around the fortress especially on its south-east side. Civilians also settled on the opposite side of the Ouse, initially along the main road from Eboracum to the south-west. By the later 2nd century, growth was rapid; streets were laid out, public buildings were erected and private houses spread out over terraces on the steep slopes above the river.

From its foundation the Roman fort of Eboracum was aligned on a north-east/south-east bearing on the north bank of the River Ouse. It measured 1,600 × 1,360 &quot;pedes monetales&quot; (474 × 403 m) and covered an area of . The standard layout of streets running through the &quot;castra&quot; is assumed, although some evidence exists for the &quot;via praetoria&quot;, &quot;via decumana&quot; and &quot;via sagularis&quot;. Much of the modern understanding of the fortress defences has come from extensive excavations undertaken by L. P. Wenham.

The layout of the fortress also followed the standard for a legionary fortress, with wooden buildings inside a square defensive boundary. These defences, originally consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74 AD. Later these were replaced by a clay mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually, wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers. The original wooden camp was refurbished by Agricola in 81, before being completely rebuilt in stone between 107 and 108. The fortress was garrisoned soon afterwards by the Sixth Legion, possibly as soon as 118.

Multiple phases of restructuring and rebuilding within the fortress are recorded. Rebuilding in stone began in the early second century AD under Trajan, but may have taken as long as the start of the reign of Septimius Severus to be completed; a period of over 100 years. Estimates suggest that over 48,000 m3 of stone were required, largely consisting of Magnesian Limestone from the quarries near the Roman settlement of Calcaria (Tadcaster).

==Visiting emperors==

There is evidence that the Emperor Hadrian visited in 122 on his way north to plan his great walled frontier. He either brought, or sent earlier, the Sixth Legion to replace the existing garrison. Emperor Septimius Severus visited Eboracum in 208 and made it his base for campaigning in Caledonia. (The fortress wall was probably reconstructed during his stay and at the east angle it is possible to see this work standing almost to full height.) The Imperial court was based in York until at least 211, when Severus died and was succeeded by his sons, Caracalla and Geta. A biographer, Cassius Dio, described a scene in which the Emperor utters the final words to his two sons on his death bed: &quot;Agree with each other, make the soldiers rich, and ignore everyone else.&quot; Severus was cremated in Eboracum shortly after his death. Dio described the ceremony: &quot;His body arrayed in military garb was placed upon a pyre, and as a mark of honour the soldiers and his sons ran about it and as for the soldier&#x27;s gifts, those who had things at hand to offer them put them upon it and his sons applied the fire.&quot; (The location of the cremation was not recorded. A hill to the west of modern York, known as Severus Hill, is associated by some antiquarians as the site where this cremation took place, but no archaeological investigation has corroborated this claim.)

In the later 3rd century, the western Empire experienced political and economic turmoil and Britain was for some time ruled by usurpers independent of Rome. It was after crushing the last of these that Emperor Constantius I came to Eboracum and, in 306, became the second Emperor to die there. His son Constantine was instantly proclaimed as successor by the troops based in the fortress. Although it took Constantine eighteen years to become sole ruler of the Empire, he may have retained an interest in Eboracum and the reconstruction of the south-west front of the fortress with polygonally-fronted interval towers and the two great corner towers, one of which (the Multangular Tower) still survives, is probably his work. In the colonia, Constantine&#x27;s reign was a time of prosperity and a number of extensive stone town houses of the period have been excavated.

==Government==
For the Romans, Eboracum was the major military base in the north of Britain and, following the 3rd century division of the province of Britannia, the capital of northern Britain, Britannia Inferior. By 237 Eboracum had been made a colonia, the highest legal status a Roman city could attain; there were only four coloniae in Britain, and all but Eboracum had been founded for retired soldiers. This mark of Imperial favour was probably a recognition of Eboracum as the largest town in the north and the capital of Britannia Inferior. At around the same time Eboracum became self-governing, with a council made up of rich locals, including merchants and veteran soldiers. In 296 Britannia Inferior was divided into two provinces of equal status with Eboracum becoming the provincial capital of Britannia Secunda.

==Culture==

As a busy port and a provincial capital Eboracum was a cosmopolitan city with residents from throughout the Roman Empire.

===Diet===
Substantial evidence for the use of cereal crops and animal husbandry can be found in &quot;Eboracum&quot;. A first-century warehouse fire from Coney Street, on the North bank of the Ouse and outside the fortress, showed that spelt wheat was the most common cereal grain used at that time, followed by barley. Cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were the major sources of meat. Hunting scenes, as shown through Romano-British &quot;hunt cups&quot;, suggest hunting was a popular pastime and that diet would be supplemented through the hunting of hare, deer and boar. A variety of food preparation vessels (mortaria) have been excavated from the city and large millstones used in the processing of cereals have been found in rural sites outside the colonia at Heslington and Stamford Bridge.

In terms of the ceremonial use of food; dining scenes are used on tombstones to represent an aspirational image of the deceased in the afterlife, reclining on a couch and being served food and wine. The tombstones of Julia Velva, Mantinia Maercia and Aelia Aeliana each depict a dining scene. Additionally, several inhumation burials from Trentholme Drive contained hen&#x27;s eggs placed in ceramic urns as grave goods for the deceased.

===Religion===

A range of evidence of Roman religious beliefs among the people of Eboracum have been found including altars to Mars, Hercules, Jupiter and Fortune. In terms of number of references, the most popular deities were the spiritual representation (&quot;genius&quot;) of Eboracum and the Mother Goddess. There is also evidence of local and regional deities. Evidence showing the worship of eastern deities has also been found during excavations in York. For example, evidence of the Mithras cult, which was popular among the military, has been found including a sculpture showing Mithras slaying a bull and a dedication to Arimanius, the god of evil in the Mithraic tradition. The Mithraic relief located in Micklegate suggests the location of a temple to Mithras right in the heart of the Colonia. Another example is the dedication of a temple to Serapis a Hellenistic-Egyptian God by the Commander of the Sixth Legion, Claudius Hieronymianus. Other known deities from the city include: Tethys, Veteris, Venus,Silvanus, Toutatis, Chnoubis and the Imperial &quot;Numen&quot;.

There was also a Christian community in Eboracum although it is unknown when this was first formed and in archaeological terms there is virtually no record of it. The first evidence of this community is a document noting the attendance of Bishop Eborius of Eboracum at the Council of Arles (314). The Episcopal see at Eboracum was called &quot;Eboracensis&quot; in Latin and Bishops from the See also attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the Council of Serdica, and the Council of Ariminum. The name is preserved in the abbreviated form &quot;Ebor&quot; as the official name of the archbishop of York.

===Death and burial===

The cemeteries of Roman York follow the major Roman roads out of the settlement; excavations in the Castle Yard (next to Clifford&#x27;s Tower), beneath the railway station, at Trentholme Drive and the Mount have located significant evidence of human remains using both inhumation and cremation burial rites. The cemetery beneath the railway station was subject to excavations in advance of railway works of 1839–41, 1845, and 1870–7. Several sarcophagi were unearthed during this phase of excavations including those of Flavius Bellator and Julia Fortunata. Inhumation burial in sarcophagi can often include the body being encased in gypsum and then in a lead coffin. Variations on this combination exist. The gypsum casts, when found undisturbed, frequently retain a cast impression of the deceased in a textile shroud – surviving examples of both adults and children show a selection of textiles used to wrap the body before interment, but usually plain woven cloth. The high number of sarcophagi from &quot;Eboracum&quot; has provided a large number of these casts, in some cases with cloth surviving adhered to the gypsum. Two gypsum burials at York have shown evidence for frankincense and another clear markers of Pistacia spp. (mastic) resin used as part of the funerary rite. These resins had been traded to &quot;Eboracum&quot; from the Mediterranean and eastern Africa, or southern Arabia, the latter known as the &quot;Frankincense Kingdom&quot; in antiquity This is the northernmost confirmed use of aromatic resins in mortuary contexts during the Roman period.

An excavation in advance of building work underneath the Yorkshire Museum in 2010 located a male skeleton with significant pathology to suggest that he may have died as a gladiator in Eboracum.

==Economy==
The military presence at Eboracum was the driving force behind early developments in its economy. In these early stages, Eboracum operated as a command economy with workshops growing up outside the fortress to supply the needs of the 5,000 troops garrisoned there. Production included military pottery until the mid-3rd century, military tile kilns have been found in the Aldwark-Peasholme Green area, glassworking at Coppergate, metalworks and leatherworks producing military equipment in Tanner Row.

In the Roman period, Eboracum was the major manufacturing centre for Whitby Jet. Known as &quot;gagates&quot; in Latin, it was used from the early 3rd century as material for jewellery and was exported from here throughout Britain and into Europe. Examples found in York take the form of rings, bracelets, necklaces, and pendants depicting married couples and the Medusa. There are fewer than 25 jet pendants in the Roman world, of which six are known from Eboracum. These are housed in the Yorkshire Museum.

===Roads===
The true paths of all original Roman roads leading out of Eboracum are not known, although eleven have been suggested. The known roads include Dere Street leading North-West from the city through Clifton towards the site of &quot;Cataractonium&quot; (modern Catterick), Cade&#x27;s Road Towards &quot;Petuaria&quot; (modern Brough), and Ermine Street towards &quot;Lindum&quot; (modern Lincoln). A road bypassing the south wall of the fortress, between the fortress and the River Ouse has not been formally planned, although its path is conjectured to run beneath the York Museum Gardens.

===Rivers===
The River Ouse and River Foss provided important access points for the importation of heavy goods. The existence of two possible wharves on the east bank of the River Foss support this idea. A large deposit of grain, in a timber structure beneath modern-day Coney Street, on the north-east bank of the River Ouse suggests the existence of storehouses for moving goods via the river.

==Late Roman York==
The decline of Roman Britain in early fifth century AD led to significant social and economic changes all over Britain. Whilst the latest datable inscription referencing &quot;Eboracum&quot; dates from 237 AD, the continuation of the settlement after this time is certain. Building work in the city continued in the fourth century under Constantine and later Count Theodosius. The locally produced Crambeck Ware pottery arrives in &quot;Eboracum&quot; in the fourth century—the most famous form being intricately decorated buff-yellow &quot;parchment ware&quot; painted with bright shades of red. The effect of Constantine&#x27;s religious policy allowed the greater development of Christianity in Roman Britain—a bishop of York named &quot;Eborius&quot; is attested here and several artifacts decorated with chi-rho symbols are known. Additionally, a small bone plaque from an inhumation grave bore the phrase (&quot;Hail sister may you live in God&quot;).

Changes in the layout of both the fort and &quot;colonia&quot; occurred in the late fourth century AD, suggested as representing a social change in the domestic lives of the military garrison here whereby they might have lived in smaller family groups with wives, children or other civilians.

==Rediscovery of Roman York==
The rediscovery and modern understanding of Eboracum began in the 17th century. Several prominent figures have been involved in this process. Martin Lister was the first to recognise that the Multangular Tower was Roman in date in a 1683 paper with the Royal Society. John Horsley&#x27;s 1732 , or &quot;The Roman Antiquities of Britain&quot;, included a chapter on Roman York and at least partly informed Francis Drake&#x27;s 1736 &quot;Eboracum&quot;—the first book of its kind on Roman York. Drake also published accounts in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society.

The Rev. Charles Wellbeloved was one of the founders of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and a curator of the antiquities in the Yorkshire Museum until his death in 1858. He published a systematic account of Roman York titled &quot;Eboracum or York under the Romans&quot; in 1842, including first hand records of discoveries during excavations in 1835. William Hargrove brought many new discoveries to the attention of the public through published articles in his newspaper the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Courant&quot; and published a series of guides with references to casual finds.

The first large-scale excavations were undertaken by S. Miller from Glasgow University in the 1920s with a focus on the defences.

==Archaeological remains==
Substantial physical remains have been excavated in York in the last two centuries including the city walls, the legionary bath-house and headquarters building, civilian houses, workshops, storehouses and cemeteries.

<doc id="1003520" wikidata="Q8020420" url="?curid=1003520" title="William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke">
<text>William Henry Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke (1 September 1830 – 29 January 1911), known as Sir William Wills, Bt., between 1893 and 1906, was a British businessman, philanthropist and Liberal politician.

==Background==
Wills was the son of William Day Wills and a cousin of Sir Edward Payson Wills Bt, Sir Frederick Wills Bt, Sir Frank William Wills Kt, and Henry Overton Wills III, first chancellor of the University of Bristol.

==Business career==
A member of the wealthy Bristol tobacco-importing Wills family, Wills joined the family firm at an early age. In 1858 he went into partnership with two of his cousins to take over W. D. &amp; H. O. Wills, which later became part of the Imperial Tobacco Company, of which he was the first chairman. Recognised as the head of the tobacco industry in Britain, he was also Chairman of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce. In 1904 he presented the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery to the people of Bristol.

==Political career==

Wills was a member of the Bristol Corporation from 1862 to 1880 and sheriff of the city from 1877 to 1878. He also sat as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for two separate five-year periods: for Coventry from 1880 to 1885, and for Bristol East from 1895 to 1900.
He served as High Sheriff of Somerset in 1905.

He was made a Baronet, of Coombe Lodge in the Parish of Blagdon in the County of Somerset, in 1893 and raised to the peerage as Baron Winterstoke, of Blagdon in the County of Somerset, in 1906. He took his title from the ancient hundred of Winterstoke, in which his home at Blagdon lay.

==Personal life==
Wills was educated at Mill Hill School, before joining the family tobacco business.

Lord Winterstoke was a keen supporter of the arts, serving as President of what is now the Royal West of England Academy (RWA) from 1898 until his death in 1911 and donating the money to create Bristol City Art Gallery, whose facade bears the inscription &quot;The Gift of Sir William Henry Wills to his Fellow Citizens 1904&quot;.

He was also the president of the charitable Anchor Society in Bristol in 1866, and vice-president of Waverley Football Club from 1890.

A zealous nonconformist by personal conviction as well as by family tradition, he actively engaged in the affairs of the free churches. He joined the board of the Dissenting Deputies, was a trustee of the Memorial Hall in London, and took a practical interest in the refoundation of Mansfield College, Oxford in 1886. To the new chapel of Mill Hill School, opened in June 1898, he gave an organ and other substantial help; his portrait, subscribed for by the governors, is at the school.

He married Elizabeth Perkins Stancomb on 11 January 1853, in Melksham, Wiltshire. Elizabeth was born 6 November 1831 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire and died at their seaside home of East Court, Ramsgate, Kent on 10 February 1896, and was buried in Ramsgate Cemetery, Plot D.C.189. They adopted Elizabeth&#x27;s two nieces.

He died without heirs in January 1911, aged 80, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct. His estate was worth £2,548,209 (roughly equivalent to £ in ). A portrait of Lord Winterstoke hangs in the Middle Common Room of Mansfield College, Oxford.

<text>Henry Clay Van Noy (April 20, 1881 – November 28, 1938) was a prominent Kansas City, Missouri, businessman and was the last surviving member of the legendary Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City - brothers who founded the company which a century later has evolved into HMSHost company. Born to Dr. Henry Clay Van Noy and Catherine S. Raber, he is also the great-grandson of Barbourville, Kentucky, pioneer William Van Noy.

In 1897, the Van Noy Brothers - who included Ira Clinton, Charles S., and Horace Greeley, founded what was to become the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company. With humble beginnings, in time the Van Noy Brothers built the company, later known as the Van Noy Interstate Co., into one of the country&#x27;s larger restaurant, hotel, and railroad service chains. Today, the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company is known as HMSHost - owned by Autogrill S.p.A.

<text>William Howard Allen (July 8, 1790 – November 9, 1822) was an American naval officer. He was born in Hudson, New York in 1790 to Howard Allen and Lydia Hussey. His sister was Harriet Allen, wife of New York lawyer and U.S. attorney general Benjamin Franklin Butler.

Allen attended school at the Hudson Academy for Boys, was appointed midshipman in 1808, and became a Second Lieutenant in 1811. During the War of 1812, he served aboard and was captured by the British on August 14, 1813, during a battle with a British sloop-of-war, where he sustained a leg injury that required amputation. Allen was interned for eighteen months in Ashburton, England.

Allen later commanded the &quot;Alligator&quot;, which was sent to the West Indies to fight pirates as part of the West Indies Squadron. He was killed in action on November 9, 1822, during a battle with pirates and was buried in Matanzas, Cuba. In 1827, Allen&#x27;s remains were moved for reburial in Hudson, New York, where a monument was erected in his memory.

<doc id="1003529" wikidata="Q1433139" url="?curid=1003529" title="Thomastown, County Kilkenny">
<text>Thomastown (), historically known as Grennan, is a town in County Kilkenny in the province of Leinster in the south-east of Ireland. It is a market town along a stretch of the River Nore which is known for its salmon and trout, with a number of historical landmarks in the vicinity. Visitor attractions include Jerpoint Abbey, Kilfane Glen gardens, and Mount Juliet Golf Course. The town is in a civil parish of the same name. As of the 2022 census, Thomastown had a population of 2,305, making the town the third most populous in the county.

==Location==

The town is situated at a bridging point on the River Nore from the city of Kilkenny. The R448 Naas–Waterford road passes through Thomastown and the town is serviced by buses and has a railway station.

It is part of the local electoral area of Callan–Thomastown for elections to Kilkenny County Council.

==History==
The town was founded in the 13th century on an important crossing point by an Anglo-Norman mercenary from Wales, Thomas FitzAnthony, replacing the earlier Irish settlement of Grennan (, Sunny Place). It is from FitzAnthony that Thomastown was named.
FitzAnthony was granted a large area of land in the region by William Earl Marshall, son-in-law of Strongbow, and became the Seneschal (Governor) of Leinster in the 13th century. He built fortifications at Thomastown, fragments of which can still be seen today, together with nearby Grennan Castle, now in ruins. FitzAnthony died in 1229. Of this castle and the town&#x27;s walls, the only remains are the towers near each end of the bridge and the remains of a 13th-century church, dedicated to St Mary. 
The town thrived and had more than 200 burgesses at the end of the 13th century. Thomastown became a small medieval walled town: the first walls were built in 1449. Edward III (twice), Henry VI, Mary I, James I, and James II granted the town royal charters. Under a 1553 charter from Queen Mary I, the burgesses of Thomastown had the right to choose two members of Parliament, a practice they continued until the Acts of Union in 1800.

In 1650 the town was attacked by Oliver Cromwell. Grennan Castle was laid siege to by Cromwell&#x27;s army and after two days the defending forces surrendered.

Local tradition holds that the remains of Saint Nicholas, the 3rd century Anatolian bishop, lie in the vicinity of Thomastown in Jerpoint Park. A grave slab with the carved heads of three people at the ruined Church of St. Nicholas, the church itself, and other stones are virtually all that remain of the medieval village of Newtown Jerpoint, which had fallen into ruin by the 17th century. The village of Newtown was adjacent to Jerpoint Abbey, founded in 1183. The abbey had its own gardens, watermills, cemetery, granary, and kitchens, and was home to a group of Irish-Norman Crusaders in the Middle Ages. It was dissolved in 1540. The legend refers to a band of Irish-Norman knights from Jerpoint, who travelled to the Holy Land to take part in the Crusades. On their return to County Kilkenny, it is said they brought St. Nicholas&#x27; remains.

==Landmarks==

Kilfane Glen is a restored historic 1790s garden with a waterfall, woodland walks and cottage orné. The garden is listed as an Irish Heritage Garden, and was awarded assistance in 1993 by the European Union Cultural Commission.

The landscape within the demesne of Kilfane House was developed during the 1790s by the then landowner and his wife, Sir John and Lady Power. Sir Richard Power, twin brother of Sir John also joined in the development of the garden.

The ruins of the 12th century Jerpoint Abbey is located near the town.

The nearby Grennan Castle, an oblong-shaped castle, dates from the 13th century and was erected by Thomas FitzAnthony. The castle was in good repair until the beginning of the 19th century, when parts of it were removed for building purposes.

==Industry==

Milling, with mills powered by the waters of the River Nore, was the principal industry in the town until the early 1960s. The mills were Pilsworth&#x27;s Mills. At one stage there were 12 water-powered mills, for grain and cloth, working in the parish. The last working mill in Thomastown closed in 1963. This mill is now the site of Grennan Mill Craft School. Several mill buildings in good condition can be seen upstream from the bridge.

For centuries there was an important boat trade to carry produce to and from the port of New Ross. It went into decline at the end of the 18th century.

==Transport==

===Road===
The R448 Naas–Waterford road passes through Thomastown where it crosses the R700 regional road. Meanwhile, the R703 road connects the town with Ballymurphy, County Carlow.

===Rail===
The town is connected to the Irish railway network on the Dublin-Waterford railway line via Kilkenny. Thomastown railway station opened on 12 May 1848.

===Bus===
The town is a stop on the Bus Éireann Waterford – Carlow – Dublin – Dublin Airport route 4. There are several daily services on this route. Thomastown is also served daily by the Bus Éireann Waterford – Athlone route 73 and on Thursday by the local Bus Éireann route, 365 to Waterford via Knocktopher. Kilbride Coaches&#x27; Kilkenny to New Ross route serves the town twice each way daily (except Sundays). Bus Éireann route 374 also operates from Kilkenny to New Ross but on Thursdays only.

==People==

Dysart Castle close to Thomastown is reputed to have been the birthplace of the influential Irish philosopher Bishop George Berkeley. Thomastown was the birthplace of the Texas empresario James Hewetson.
Born in Kilmurry, Mildred Anne Butler (1858–1941) was an artist associated with the Newlyn School, she worked in watercolour and oil of landscape, genre and animal subjects. Butler spent most of her life at her family home in Kilmurry, Thomastown.
The house previously belonged to the Bushe family, whose most distinguished member was Charles Kendal Bushe, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, who was born at Kilmurry in 1767.

A bronze statue of Ollie Walsh, a Thomastown hurler, stands in Mill Street. Monsignor Tommy Maher played hurling with the local club Thomastown and with the Kilkenny senior inter-county team in the 1940s and coached Kilkenny to seven senior All-Ireland titles between 1957 and 1978. Tom Walsh played hurling with Thomastown and Kilkenny&#x27;s senior inter-county team in the 1960s.

British songwriter and guitarist John Martyn lived in Thomastown from 1998 until his death in 2009.

Victoria Cross recipient William Dowling was born in Thomastown.

==Sport==
Kayaking (canoeing) and fishing are common on the River Nore in the area, with the Thomastown Paddlers Canoe Club providing training on the river, which leads to the village Inistioge.

<doc id="1003531" wikidata="Q2330948" url="?curid=1003531" title="Van de Graaff (crater)">
<text>Van de Graaff is a crater formation located on the far side of the Moon, on the northeast edge of Mare Ingenii.

The crater is named for physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff, whose groundbreaking work includes the invention of the Van de Graaff generator.

Van de Graaff is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

==Description==
Van de Graaff has the appearance of two merged craters, approximately in a shape with no intervening rim separating the two halves.

The crater Birkeland is attached to the southeast rim, nestling against the slightly narrower &quot;waist&quot; of the formation. To the north is Aitken, and Nassau lies to the east.

The outer rim has some terracing along the southwest wall, but is generally in a worn and eroded state. A pair of craterlets overlay the southeast rim, next to Birkeland. There are also several small craters on the interior floor of Van de Graaff. The southwest section has a central peak, while the northeast floor is slightly smoother in form.

Orbital studies of the Moon have demonstrated that there is a local magnetic field in the vicinity of this formation that is stronger than the natural lunar field. This is most likely an indication of volcanic rock underneath the surface. The crater also has a slightly higher concentration of radioactive materials than is typical for the lunar surface.

The crater walls in the vicinity of Van de Graaff display an unusual grooved texture. This region lies at the antipode of the Mare Imbrium impact site, and it is thought that powerful seismic waves from this event converged at this point.
Most likely this energy created the grooved appearance as the tremors triggered landslides, although the grooves may also have been formed by deposited clumps of ejecta from the impact.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Van de Graaff.

<text>The Hansa-Brandenburg B.I was an unarmed military trainer and reconnaissance biplane of World War I, flown by the Austro-Hungarian Air Service. Early models were known internally to the Hansa-Brandenburg firm as the type D, while later models with a more powerful engine were designated FD. This aircraft was one of the earliest designs of Ernst Heinkel, who was working for Hansa-Brandenburg at the time. It was an entirely conventional two-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span. The pilot and observer sat in tandem in a long open cockpit.

The aircraft was produced under license by Aero, both during the war and afterwards (when it became known as the [[Aero Ae 01]]), and also by Letov, as the Š10. Experience gained with this design would provide Aero with the basis for a number of derivative civil and military designs throughout the 1920s.

The design formed the basis for the C.I and C.II armed reconnaissance types.

==Variants==
&quot;both variants shared the military designation B.I&quot;
* D - initial version with Benz Bz.II engine
* FD - later version with Benz Bz.III engine

==Operators==
*Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops
*Austro-Hungarian Navy
*Polish Air Force (postwar, 15 aircraft)
*Czechoslovak Air Force (postwar)
*Royal Hungarian Air Force
*Yugoslav Royal Air Force (postwar)
*Letalski center Maribor (postwar)
==Survivors==
Only a single Hansa-Brandenburg B.I has survived World War One, it is located in the Budapest Aviation Museum in Hungary.

<text>Daniel Ammen (May 15, 1820 – July 11, 1898) was a U.S. naval officer during the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era, as well as a prolific author. His last assignment in the Navy was Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.

==Early career==

Daniel Ammen was born on May 15, 1820, in Brown County, Ohio, the son of David and Sarah Ammen. His father served in the War of 1812 and migrated to Ohio from Virginia. His older brother was Jacob Ammen, who became a brigadier general in the Union Army. They both attended the same school as Ulysses S. Grant, who was best friends with Daniel. As children, Ammen rescued Grant from drowning.

Ammen entered the Navy as a midshipman on 7 July 1836 and following the basic training, he was attached to the newly commissioned supply ship USS &quot;Relief&quot;, which was preparing for the Wilkes Exploring Expedition to Antarctica. Before he could depart for South Ocean, he was transferred to the frigate USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; in July 1837 and then transferred to USS &quot;Levant&quot; in March 1838. Ammen sailed for West Indies and while there, he was transferred to USS &quot;Vandalia&quot;.

In March 1840, Ammen was attached to USS &quot;Preble&quot; and took part in a cruise along the coast of Labrador, the Preble sailed for the Mediterranean Sea in January 1841 to join the squadron of Commodore Charles W. Morgan. In May that year he was transferred to the USS &quot;Ohio&quot;, in which he returned to Boston, Massachusetts, in July 1841.

He was subsequently ordered to the Naval School at Philadelphia (predecessor of the United States Naval Academy) and following the study during the winter of 1841–42, Ammen was promoted to passed midshipman on July 1, 1842. He then served at the schooner USS &quot;Experiment&quot;, which was used as the receiving ship at Philadelphia Navy Yard. Ammen joined the crew of frigate USS &quot;Savannah&quot; and took part in the several patrol cruises in the Pacific Ocean.

In October 1843, Ammen was transferred to the sloop USS &quot;Lexington&quot; and made several trips to the Mediterranean Sea to deliver supplies. He was attached to the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; in April 1845 and took part in the cruise to the East Indies. Following his promotion to the rank of Master (equivalent of present rank of Lieutenant (junior grade), Ammen was granted three-month leave with permission to visit Europe and then join the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Charles W. Morgan, whose Ammen knew from his previous assignment in 1841.

Morgan promoted Ammen to lieutenant on November 4, 1849, and appointed him Commanding officer of frigate USS &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;. Ammen commanded the ship in the Mediterranean during the crisis caused by First Schleswig War and returned to the United States with that vessel in November 1850.

Following a tour of coast survey duty, Ammen was ordered to the gunboat USS &quot;Water Witch&quot; under command of Lieutenant Thomas J. Page and sailed for South America for expedition to explore the Río de la Plata Basin. He then joined the crew of brig USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; in May 1854 and participated in the patrol cruises with the Brazil Squadron until January 1855.

He then served at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., until August 1857 and then joined USS &quot;Saranac&quot; which patrolled Pacific Ocean areas. Ammen was transferred to the Flagship of the Pacific Squadron, USS &quot;Merrimack&quot; and served under Commodore John C. Long until ship&#x27;s return to the United States in February 1860. He was then stationed at the Naval Facility in Baltimore, Maryland, until the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861.

==American Civil War==

One month following the outbreak of the War, Ammen was attached to the frigate USS &quot;Roanoke&quot; and immediately embarked for the Union blockade. He was aboard, when &quot;Roanoke&quot; destroyed the Confederate schooner &quot;Mary&quot; off Lockwood Folly Inlet, North Carolina, in July 1861. Ammen was appointed commanding officer of newly commissioned gunboat USS &quot;Seneca&quot; in September that year and took part in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

Ammen then participated in the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861, and was commended for bravery, when he went ashore to hoist the flag over the surrendered forts, and hold them till the army took possession. He then took part in the actions on the Wilmington River at the end of January 1862 and participated in the capture of several Confederate vessels and the town of Fernandina, Florida.

Upon his promotion to commander on July 16, 1862, Ammen assumed command of the gunboat USS &quot;Sebago&quot;, which he commanded only for a brief period. He was ordered to Washington, D.C., in October 1862 and joined the monitor USS &quot;Patapsco&quot;, which was just launched. The &quot;Patapsco&quot; was commissioned in January 1863, and Ammen joined with her the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

He took part in the Naval bombardment of Fort McAllister between January–March 1863 and although Union ships did not capture the fort, commanding admiral Samuel F. Du Pont had the opportunity to test ship&#x27;s new guns. Ammen was relieved due to illness in June that year and was on sick leave until September. He was subsequently attached to the staff of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren and served as Dahlgren&#x27;s aide aboard the USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. Ammen took part in the Second Battle of Fort Sumter in September 1863.

Ammen became ill again in January 1864 and spent two months with treatment. He then assumed temporary command of the USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; in March that year and served with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for one month, before he was appointed officer-in-charge of Marine recruits aboard the merchant vessel in May 1864. His main task was to transport approximately 220 Naval recruits from Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, to New York City. There was also about 500 passengers aboard that vessel.

The recruits were recently transferred from the Army to the Navy as replacements, and shortly after the departure from Aspinwall, approximately 30 recruits began planning the plot to seize the ship. They intended to kill everyone who should oppose them, and the conspiracy included the running of the vessel, after her seizure, on their own account. The mutineers attacked Captain Tinklepaugh, but he refused to comply and called for Commander Ammen.

Captain Tinklepaugh, who had expected the difficulty and was prepared, aimed his revolver at the head of the one of mutineers&#x27; leaders, and warned him that if he advanced a step further he would lose his life. Mutineer sprang forward and Tinklepaugh killed him instantly, Ammen subsequently pulled out his revolver and shot another one, who tried to attack him. The rest of the mutineers then surrendered and Ammen ordered to put them all to the handcuffs.

In October 1864, Ammen was appointed commander of the USS &quot;Mohican&quot; and commanded &quot;Mohican&quot; during the attacks on Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865.

==Postwar service==

Following the War, Ammen was assigned to the Naval Machinery at Charlotte, North Carolina, in July 1865 and remained there until September that year, when he was appointed commanding officer of the monitor USS &quot;Miantonomoh&quot;. He served with that vessel within the North Atlantic Squadron until March 1866, when he was detached for special duty in Hartford, Connecticut. While there, Ammen was promoted to the rank of captain on July 25, 1866.

He was appointed commanding officer of a newly commissioned screw steamer USS &quot;Piscataqua&quot; at Portsmouth Navy Yard and served within the Asiatic Station until February 1869. During his service there, Ammen&#x27;s vessel served as Flagship to Commanding admiral, Stephen C. Rowan.

Following his return stateside and leave with family, Ammen was appointed chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks in May 1869. He was responsible for building and maintaining navy yards, drydocks, and other facilities relating to ship construction, maintenance, and repair until August 1871.

He was subsequently appointed chief of the Bureau of Navigation and promoted to commodore on April 1, 1872. While in this assignment, his principal responsibilities were to provide nautical charts and instruments and to oversee several activities involved navigation research, including the Naval Observatory. In 1872 he was appointed member of a commission to examine and report on the feasibility of constructing a canal through Nicaragua. The commission reported in favour of the Nicaraguan route, which he strongly advocated. He was promoted to rear admiral on December 11, 1877. Ammen served with the Bureau of Navigation until his retirement from the Navy on June 4, 1878.

==Retirement==

Two years later, he wrote &quot;The American Inter-Oceanic Ship Canal Question&quot;. Afterwards he was a member of the board to locate the new Naval Observatory, and a representative of the United States at the Interoceanic Ship Canal Congress in Paris. He designed a cask balsa to facilitate the landing of troops and field artillery, a life-raft for steamers, and the steel ram USS in 1893.

Ammen later purchased a farm twelve miles from Washington, D.C., at Ammendale, a station named in his honor. The Ammendale Normal Institute was built there with his support in 1880.

His publications include &quot;The Atlantic Coast in The Navy&quot; in the &quot;Civil War Series&quot;; &quot;Recollections of Grant&quot;; and &quot;The Old Navy and the New&quot;.

He died on July 11, 1898, in Washington, D.C., and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Ammen was married and had one son, Ulysses Grant Ammen (1871–1913), who served as Paymaster in the Navy.

==Namesake==
Two ships in the United States Navy have been named for him.

<text>My Friend Flicka is a 1941 novel by Mary O&#x27;Hara, about Ken McLaughlin, the son of a Wyoming rancher, and his mustang horse Flicka. It was the first in a trilogy, followed by &quot;Thunderhead&quot; (1943) and &quot;Green Grass of Wyoming&quot; (1946). The popular 1943 film version featured young Roddy McDowall and was followed by two other film adaptations, &quot;Thunderhead, Son of Flicka&quot; (1945), and &quot;Green Grass of Wyoming&quot; (1948), both based on O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s novels. A &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot; television series followed during 1956–1957, which first aired on CBS, then on NBC, with reruns on ABC and CBS between 1959 and 1966. The Disney Channel re-ran the program during the mid-1980s.

==Plot summary==
Kenneth McLaughlin is a 10-year-old boy living on Goose Bar Ranch, just out of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his practical father, Rob; his mother, Nell; and his older brother, Howard. Rob is often unsatisfied with Ken, who daydreams when he should be attending to practical matters; Nell, however, shares her son&#x27;s sensitive nature and is more sympathetic. Howard, the older son, who looks and acts more like Rob, was allowed to choose and train a colt from among the Goose Bar herd (thoroughbreds that Rob McLaughlin is raising in the old-fashioned way, on the open range), much to the jealousy of Ken. Although Ken loves horses, Rob doesn&#x27;t think his wool-gathering son deserves such a privilege yet.

At the beginning of the novel, Ken has angered his father by returning home from boarding school with failing grades and will have to repeat fifth grade, an expense Rob can ill afford. After a few mishaps in his first few days home, Nell convinces Rob to give Ken a colt, saying it will give him something to work towards and improve himself and his sense of responsibility. Ken is unable to decide which yearling he wants until he sees a beautiful sorrel filly running swiftly away from him.

Rob disapproves Ken&#x27;s choice; this particular filly has a strain of mustang blood that makes her unpredictable. Her sire was a wild stallion called the Albino, named for his pure white coat. All the Goose Bar horses with this strain have been fast and beautiful, but untameable, and after many years of trying to break them, Rob has decided to get rid of them all. Ken persists and Rob reluctantly agrees to let him have the filly. Rob, Ken, and the ranch hands make two attempts to capture her. During the second attempt, she severely injures herself trying to jump a high barbed wire fence.

Ken spends the summer caring for the filly. He names her Flicka; Swedish for &quot;little girl&quot;. Flicka comes to love and trust the boy, but her wounds fester and cause a dangerous blood infection, still young Ken perseveres in his care of her. During this time, he writes his overdue essay well enough to convince his fifth-grade English teacher to promote him to the next grade. However Flicka grows so thin and weak that Rob decides she must be shot to put her out of her misery. The night before the order is to be carried out, Flicka wades into a shallow brook, falls, and is unable to rise. Ken sneaks from the house and spends the night sitting on the bank of the stream, with his legs in the cold water, holding her head to prevent her from drowning. When he is found the next morning, he has developed chills then a high fever but Flicka was alive. As the days pass, Ken&#x27;s fever turns to pneumonia, and his condition continues downhill. On the other hand, Flicka gains strength steadily. By the end of the book, Ken has not only regained sufficient health to return to school he learns that his beloved horse is alive.

<text>Admiral of the Blue Mariot Arbuthnot (1711 – 31 January 1794) was a Royal Navy officer who served in the American War of Independence.

==Early life==
A native of Weymouth, Dorset in England, Arbuthnot was the son of Robert Arbuthnot and Sarah, née Bury. Robert&#x27;s father was the son of the Rev. Robert Arbuthnot, Presbyterian minister of Crichton &amp; Cranston. Mariot Arbuthnot entered the Royal Navy in the late 1720s, became a lieutenant in 1739, and commander in 1746. In 1746 he was commander of the sloop , which captured two French privateers while employed as a cruiser in the channel. He was appointed post captain in 1747. On 22 June 1747 Arbuthnot became captain of the frigate . Shortly afterwards he became captain of the .

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

In 1757 he became chief officer of the . In 1759, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, he commanded the , one of the ships employed under Commodore Robert Duff in the blockade of Quiberon Bay, and was present at the total defeat of the French on 20 November. Towards the end of the war he commanded . In 1770 he was made captain of .

==American War of Independence==

From 1775 to 1778, he was Resident Commissioner of the Navy, Halifax Nova Scotia. He was Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, 1776–78. He was replaced in this role by Richard Hughes. It may have been about then that an armed schooner was named &quot;Arbuthnot&quot; after him. On 19 March 1779, he was made Vice-Admiral of the Blue, and on 2 May 1779 took command of . That same year he took up his appointment as commander-in-chief on the North American Station. Soon after arriving at his destination, he was blockaded in New York City harbour by the French fleet under Count d&#x27;Estaing.

In December 1779, Arbuthnot conveyed the troops of Sir Henry Clinton to Charleston, South Carolina, and cooperated with him in laying siege to that city. The surrender document signed by prominent citizens was addressed to him and Clinton. On 26 September 1780 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the White. On 13 March 1781, he fought the French Newport squadron, at the Battle of Cape Henry, before returning to England.

==Later life==
He advanced by seniority to become, on 1 February 1793, Admiral of the Blue. He died in London the following year, leaving two sons, John and Charles.

That he was ignorant of the discipline of his profession was proved by his altercation with Sir George Rodney; that he was destitute of even a rudimentary knowledge of naval tactics was shown by his absurd conduct of the Battle of Cape Henry; and, for the rest, he appears in contemporary stories (cf. &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, 18 May 1781) as a coarse, blustering, foul-mouthed bully, and, in history, as a sample of the extremity to which the maladministration of Lord Sandwich had reduced the British Navy.

Admiral Arbuthnot was the nephew of Dr. John Arbuthnot, the satirist and mathematician.

<text>Thomson is a lunar impact crater that is located within the Mare Ingenii on the far side of the Moon. Just to the northeast is the unusual merged crater formation of Van de Graaff. On the northwest rim of the mare is O&#x27;Day, and to the south-southwest is Obruchev on the southern shore of Mare Ingenii.

In the past the crater was flooded by lava, leaving only the outer rim intact. There are gaps in the eastern and western rims, leaving two &quot;half-moon&quot; mountainous formations facing each other across the relatively flat floor. There is a similar lava-flooded crater remnant attached to the southern rim of Thomson. The floor of Thomson has a number of secondary impacts that form short, linear streaks across the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Thomson.

<text>George Mifflin Bache, Jr. (November 12, 1841 – February 11, 1896) was an officer in the United States Navy, fighting on the Union side in the American Civil War and continuing to serve for a decade after the war&#x27;s end. The &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyer was named for him.

==Early life and ancestors==
He was born in Washington, D.C., to Lt. George Mifflin Bache, USN, who was lost at sea in 1846, and Elizabeth Catherine Patterson.There is a monument in the Congressional Cemetery on Washington to the elder Lt. 
Bache and the 22 men under his command who were lost in that incident. 

He was the grandson of Richard Bache, Jr., who served in the Republic of Texas navy and was an elected representative in the Texas legislature, and Sophia Burrell Dallas, daughter of Arabella Maria Smith and Alexander James Dallas, who served as the U.S. Treasury Secretary under President James Madison.

He was also a great-grandson of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache, and a great-great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, as well as a nephew of George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States, serving under James K. Polk.

His uncles included Alexander Dallas Bache, Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, and Admiral David Dixon Porter.

==Education and career==
His father was killed in 1846, swept overboard during a gale while in command of the brig , but despite this Bache joined the United States Navy in August 1855, serving as captain&#x27;s clerk aboard the sloop-of-war until May 1857. He then briefly served aboard the U.S. Coast Survey schooner as acting-master&#x27;s mate under the command of Lieutenant Richard Wainwright, another uncle by marriage, before entering the United States Naval Academy on November 19, 1857, with the rank of acting-midshipman. He graduated on June 1, 1861, just after the outbreak of the Civil War, with the rank of midshipman.

==Civil War and later life==
During the war, he first served aboard . Promoted to lieutenant on July 16, 1862, he served briefly in the steam sloop before transferring to the squadron on the Mississippi River late in 1862. On November 8, 1862, he received orders to assume command of the stern-wheel casemate gunboat . Bache commanded the gunboat during operations leading up to the fall of Vicksburg, Mississippi, early in July 1863. During those operations, however, his ship was sunk on May 27, 1863, while dueling Confederate batteries defending the river approaches to the city.

That summer, he took command of the sidewheel gunboat and led her in a number of engagements with Confederate forces. In 1864, he returned to the Atlantic blockade as executive officer of &quot;Powhatan&quot;. While assigned to that ship, Bache participated in both the unsuccessful and successful assaults on Fort Fisher, carried out in December 1864 and January 1865. In the latter attack, he was wounded but not severely.

Promoted to lieutenant-commander on July 25, 1866, he served in until she was destroyed on a reef at the mouth of the Godavari River, Madras, India, on June 19, 1867. Between 1869 and 1872, Bache was assigned to the steam sloop on the European Station. After that, he went ashore to ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard until his retirement on April 5, 1875, receiving promotion to commander the same day.

Bache died on February 11, 1896, at Washington, D.C.

The destroyer (1942–1968) was named in his honor.

<text>Greatest Hits, later re-released as Greatest Hits 1973–1988, is the first greatest hits compilation album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released by Columbia Records on November 11, 1980.

== Release and reception ==
Although the official website for Aerosmith lists the release for &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as October 1980, and the album was originally scheduled for release on October 24, 1980, it was delayed until November 11, 1980.

Some of the tracks were significantly edited from their original versions. The single version of &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; was used, and was edited down almost a full minute. It also contained an alternate lyric which was not heard on &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;. The original lyric was &quot;Gotcha with the cocaine, found with your gun.&quot; The alternate lyric, included on the compilation, was &quot;You shady lookin&#x27; loser, you played with my gun.&quot; &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; also used the single version; it begins with the first chorus, cutting out the now famous talk box intro and the coda was replaced with a repeating chorus and fades out. &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; was also edited down, cutting the intro and certain other parts. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; was edited slightly, chanting the first chorus once instead of twice. The other remaining tracks were kept intact.

On April 21, 1997, a slightly revised version, &quot;Greatest Hits 1973–1988&quot;, was released outside the US, with the ten tracks in their edited versions retained, with five additional songs from the same era added, plus the 1991 version of &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and a live version of &quot;One Way Street&quot;.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the band&#x27;s highest RIAA certified album in the United States, having been certified 12× Platinum in 2021.

<doc id="1003560" wikidata="Q1071816" url="?curid=1003560" title="Chicago (typeface)">
<text>Chicago is a sans-serif typeface designed by Susan Kare for Apple Computer. It was used in the Macintosh operating system user interface between 1984 and 1997 and was an important part of Apple&#x27;s brand identity. It was also used in early versions of the iPod user interface. Chicago was initially a bitmap font; as the Apple OS’s capabilities improved, Apple commissioned the type foundry Bigelow &amp; Holmes to create a vector-based TrueType version. The typeface is named after the U.S. city of Chicago, following the theme of original Macintosh fonts being named after major world cities.

== Description ==
Susan Kare said that Chicago was the first font to be developed for the Macintosh. Before the team settled on the convention of naming fonts after &quot;world cities&quot;, it was called &quot;Elefont&quot; (Elefont is also the name of a bold semi-serif typeface designed by Bob McGrath in 1978). The first bitmap version included only a 12 pt. version. This font, with only very minor changes to spacing, was used for menus, dialogs, window titles, and text labels, through version 7.6 of the system. The TrueType version had many differences from the bitmap version, which became more apparent at greater sizes. One of Chicago&#x27;s features was that it could remain legible while being made &quot;grey&quot; (to indicate a disabled menu item) by the removal of every other pixel (since actual grey type was not supported by the original Macintosh graphics hardware). The zero was slashed to distinguish it from capital &quot;O&quot;.

In Mac OS 8, Charcoal replaced Chicago as the default system font. Chicago continued to be distributed as a standard component of the system, and Apple even urged developers to keep designing user interfaces for the Chicago typeface, since the new alternate fonts used the Chicago metrics as a foundation.

German-language versions of the Mac OS, as well as all language versions of Mac OS 9, had a different rendering of the 12-point version of Chicago. The letter W had two dips instead of one at the bottom of the letter, the letter V had its lower tip at the centre instead of veering left, and the letter I (capital &quot;i&quot;) had serifs at the top and bottom, distinguishing it from l (lowercase &quot;L&quot;). A mix of this and the original Chicago was used in the original iPod.

Chicago was also used in Apple marketing materials. It was common to find this font in early amateur desktop publishing productions, since it was available as part of the system. While Apple gravitated away from Chicago following the adoption of the relatively easier-to-read Charcoal as part of the platinum theme in Mac OS, it was later revived in the user interface for the iPod music player, where legibility on its low resolution two-color screen once again became an asset. With the introduction of the iPod mini, a smaller typeface was needed, and the Espy Sans font from the Apple Newton was used. Finally, with the introduction of the iPod Photo, the color iPod interface changed to Podium Sans—a bitmap font similar to the Myriad Pro typeface which Apple has adopted gradually for its marketing since 2002.

The Chicago pixel typeface was also adapted by Squaresoft for use in the English releases of their Super NES titles, such as &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.

Though the original font is no longer bundled with macOS, two Thai-language fonts bundled with macOS, Krungthep and Silom, use Chicago for their Latin letters and hence can be used as modern replacements.

Chicago is a registered trademark (&quot;typeface fonts recorded on computer software&quot;), belonging to Apple since August 1996 ().

<doc id="1003561" wikidata="Q780585" url="?curid=1003561" title="A Planet Called Treason">
<text>A Planet Called Treason is a 1979 science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card. It is about a &quot;radical regenerative&quot; named Lanik who is banished from his kingdom and travels to different regions of the planet, discovering the powers of the people living there. It was originally published by St Martin&#x27;s Press and Dell Publishing Co. After being heavily revised, and growing roughly 50 pages longer, it was republished in 1988 by St. Martin&#x27;s under the title Treason.

&quot;A Planet Called Treason&quot; was Card&#x27;s second published novel-length science fiction story; the short story collection &quot;Capitol&quot; had been published in January; &quot;Hot Sleep&quot; was published in April.

==Plot summary==
The premise of this novel is the banishment to the seemingly metal-poor planet Treason of a group of people who attempted to create rule by an intellectual elite. The novel centers on the descendants of these anti-democratic thinkers who remain imprisoned on the planet. Through the ages, these descendants have formed nations which warred and allied with one another to gain advantages over their rivals in the race to build a starship. Due to the metal-deficiency on Treason, nations are forced to obtain it through a system of barter using teleportation devices known as Ambassadors.

The protagonist of the book is Lanik Mueller, heir apparent to the Mueller family kingdom. The Muellers, through generations of eugenics, have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to obtain iron and other metals, they trade organs and body parts, which are harvested from radical regeneratives (&quot;rads&quot;). Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies can&#x27;t distinguish between health and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of puberty, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.

After it is discovered that Lanik is a radical regenerative, Lanik&#x27;s father must essentially banish him from the kingdom, so as to avoid sending him to the &quot;pens&quot;, a place where radical regeneratives are kept in order to harvest their body parts; exile also functions to get Lanik out of the eye of the Mueller public, as well as to prevent harm from coming to Lanik&#x27;s supposed younger brother Dinte. The banishment comes in the form of sending Lanik as an emissary and spy to the Nkumai, a rival nation. Due to his radical regenerative body, Lanik has grown breasts, which makes him appear to be a woman. Using this subterfuge, he poses as an ambassador from the matriarchal nation of Bird in order to discover what the Nkumai are trading in exchange for their abundant metals, which have allowed them to dominate their region militarily.

This mission is only the beginning of the adventure for Lanik, who discovers the secrets of the most powerful nations and at the same time gains additional abilities to save his people and determine the fate of his planet.

==Planetary regions==

Lanik travels to many of the regions of the planet Treason throughout the book, and discovers that those residing in different regions have different powers or capabilities. He first passes through the land of the Ku Kuei while on his way to Nkumai, learning that they can control the flow of time in a bubble extending out from themselves. When he comes to the land of Schwartz, he discovers that the people there are able to form rock to their will, as well as take energy from the sun. Lanik learns both of these skills and uses them to kill the &quot;illuders&quot; from Anderson. The illuders, as Lanik calls them, have the ability to appear to be anything they wish, clouding the minds of those around them to their will. This is what allowed them to infiltrate many regions of Treason. With the information that Lanik learned from the Ku Kei, and the Schwartz, he ultimately kills all of Anderson, and destroy all of the Ambassadors. With no way for any Family to get iron, Lanik concludes, the wars would end and there would be peace. The regions of Treason are named after each of the banished inhabitants.

<doc id="1003563" wikidata="Q630614" url="?curid=1003563" title="O'Day (crater)">
<text>O&#x27;Day is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It intrudes into the northwestern edge of Mare Ingenii, and the rim is lower on that side. To the northwest is the crater pair of Holetschek and Sierpinski. Southwest of O&#x27;Day lies the crater Seidel. It is named in honour of the American physicist Marcus O&#x27;Day.

The crater rim of O&#x27;Day remains sharp-edged, and the inner wall is d, especially in the northwestern half away from the mare. A small crater lies across the southern rim, and a tiny craterlet is located in the low inner rim between the crater and the mare. The floor is rough and irregular, with a double-peak at the midpoint.

Due to its prominent rays, O&#x27;Day is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to O&#x27;Day.

<text>The gens Aurelia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, which flourished from the third century BC to the latest period of the Empire. The first of the Aurelian gens to obtain the consulship was Gaius Aurelius Cotta in 252 BC. From then to the end of the Republic, the Aurelii supplied many distinguished statesmen, before entering a period of relative obscurity under the early emperors. In the latter part of the first century, a family of the Aurelii rose to prominence, obtaining patrician status, and eventually the throne itself. A series of emperors belonged to this family, through birth or adoption, including Marcus Aurelius and the members of the Severan dynasty.

In 212, the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; of Caracalla (whose full name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) granted Roman citizenship to all free residents of the Empire, resulting in vast numbers of new citizens who assumed the nomen &quot;Aurelius&quot;, in honour of their patron, including several emperors: seven of the eleven emperors between Gallienus and Diocletian (Claudius Gothicus, Quintillus, Probus, Carus, Carinus, Numerian and Maximian) bore the name &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;. So ubiquitous was the name in the latter centuries of the Empire that it suffered abbreviation, as &quot;Aur.&quot;, and it becomes difficult to distinguish members of the Aurelian gens from other persons bearing the name.

==Origin==
The nomen &quot;Aurelius&quot; is usually connected with the Latin adjective &quot;aureus&quot;, meaning &quot;golden&quot;, in which case it was probably derived from the color of a person&#x27;s hair. However, Festus reports that the original form of the nomen was &quot;Auselius&quot;, and that the medial &#x27;s&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;r&#x27; at a relatively early period; the same process occurred with the archaic nomina &quot;Fusia, Numisia, Papisia, Valesia&quot;, and &quot;Vetusia&quot;, which became &quot;Furia, Numeria, Papiria, Valeria&quot;, and &quot;Veturia&quot; in classical Latin. According to Festus, &quot;Auselius&quot; was derived from a Sabine word for the sun.

==Praenomina==
All of the praenomina used by the chief families of the Aurelii were common throughout Roman history. The Aurelii of the Republic primarily used &quot;Gaius, Lucius, Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Publius&quot;, to which the Aurelii Orestides added &quot;Gnaeus&quot;. The Aurelii Fulvi of imperial times used &quot;Titus, Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Lucius&quot;, while the Aurelii Symmachi used &quot;Quintus&quot; and &quot;Lucius&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==

There were three main stirpes of the Aurelii in republican times, distinguished by the cognomina &quot;Cotta&quot; (also spelled &quot;Cota&quot;)&quot;, Orestes&quot;, and &quot;Scaurus&quot;. &quot;Cotta&quot; and &quot;Scaurus&quot; appear on coins, together with a fourth surname, &quot;Rufus&quot;, which does not occur among the ancient writers. A few personal cognomina are also found, including &quot;Pecuniola&quot;, apparently referring to the poverty of one of the Aurelii during the First Punic War.

&quot;Cotta&quot;, the surname of the oldest and most illustrious branch of the Aurelii under the Republic, probably refers to a cowlick, or unruly shock of hair; but its derivation is uncertain, and an alternative explanation might be that it derives from a dialectical form of &quot;cocta&quot;, literally &quot;cooked&quot;, or in this case &quot;sunburnt&quot;. Marcus Aurelius Cotta, moneyer in 139 BC, minted an unusual denarius, featuring Hercules in a biga driven by centaurs, presumably alluding to some mythological event connected with the gens, but the exact symbolism is unknown. The Aurelii Cottae were prominent from the First Punic War down to the time of Tiberius, after which they faded into obscurity. The last of this family appearing in history include Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus, a friend of Tiberius, who squandered his family fortune through reckless prodigality, and his son, who received a stipend from Nero in order to maintain his household in a manner befitting his illustrious forebears. The Cottae were related to Julius Caesar and Augustus through Aurelia Cotta, who was Caesar&#x27;s mother.

The Aurelii Scauri were a relatively small family, which flourished during the last two centuries of the Republic. Their surname, &quot;Scaurus&quot;, belongs to a common class of cognomina derived from an individual&#x27;s physical features, and referred to someone with swollen ankles.

&quot;Orestes&quot;, the surname of a family that flourished for about a century toward the end of the Republic, was a Greek name, and belonged to a class of surnames of foreign origin, which appear during the middle and late Republic. In Greek mythology, Orestes was the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, and avenged his father&#x27;s murder by slaying his own mother, and after escaping the judgment of the Erinyes, became king of Mycenae. The circumstances by which the name became attached to a branch of the Aurelii are unclear, but perhaps allude to some heroic deed, or military service in Greece.

The Aurelii Fulvi, who rose to prominence in imperial times, originally came from Nemausus in Gallia Narbonensis. Titus Aurelius Fulvus, the first of the family to attain the consulship, was made a patrician about AD 73 or 74. In the second century, the Aurelii Fulvi obtained the Empire itself, when the consul&#x27;s grandson, Titus Aurelius Fulvus, was adopted as the successor to Hadrian, becoming the emperor Antoninus Pius. Most of the emperors who followed were born or adopted into the gens, through the end of the Severan dynasty. The surname &quot;Fulvus&quot; was a common surname, referring to someone with yellowish, yellow-brown, tawny, or strawberry blond hair.

The Aurelii Galli were a family that achieved notability during the second century, attaining the consulship on at least three occasions. Their surname, &quot;Gallus&quot;, had two common derivations, referring either to a cockerel, or to a Gaul. In the latter case, it might indicate that the first of this family was of Gallic descent, that he was born in Gaul, that he had performed some noteworthy deed in Gaul, or that in some manner he resembled a Gaul.

The Aurelii Symmachi were one of the last great families of the western empire, holding the highest offices of the Roman state during the fourth and fifth centuries. The Symmachi were regarded as members of the old Roman aristocracy, and acquired a reputation for their wisdom and learning.

==Members==
===Aurelii Cottae===
* Gaius Aurelius L. f. C. n. Cotta, consul in 252 and 248 BC, during the First Punic War, he fought against the Carthaginians in Sicily, taking the towns of Himera and Lipara, and receiving a triumph for his victories in the former year. He was censor in 241, and magister equitum to the dictator Gaius Duilius in 231.
*Gaius Aurelius C. f. L. n. Cotta, legate of the consul Claudius Marcellus in 216 BC.
* Marcus Aurelius C. f. L. n. Cotta, plebeian aedile in 216 BC. In 212, during the Second Punic War, he served under the consul Appius Claudius Pulcher at Puteoli. He was appointed &quot;decemvir sacrorum&quot; in 203, and the following year was an ambassador to Philip V of Macedon. He died in 201.
* Gaius Aurelius C. f. C. n. Cotta, &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; in 202 BC, and consul in 200, carried on the war against the Gauls in Italy. When the enemy was defeated by the praetor Lucius Furius Purpureo, Cotta distracted himself by raiding and plundering the countryside.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. C. n. Cotta, served as the legate of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus during the war against Antiochus III in 189 BC. He brought Antiochus&#x27; ambassadors and other representatives of the east to Rome, where he gave his report to the senate.
* Lucius Aurelius C. f. C. n. Cotta, military tribune in 181 BC, was one of the commanders of the third legion in the war against the Ligures, together with Sextus Julius Caesar.
* Lucius Aurelius L. f. C. n. Cotta, as tribune of the plebs in 154 BC, attempted to use his sacrosanctity as tribune to evade his creditors. Consul in 144 BC, he was denied the command against Viriathus through the influence of Scipio Aemilianus, who subsequently accused him of various crimes. Cotta was acquitted, chiefly out of spite against Scipio.
* Lucius Aurelius L. f. L. n. Cotta, consul in 119 BC, attempted to prosecute Gaius Marius, then tribune of the plebs, for a law he had proposed to reduce the influence of the optimates in the comitia. Marius threatened to imprison Cotta, and the senate abandoned the consul&#x27;s scheme.
* Marcus Aurelius (L. f. L. n.) Cotta, in 139 BC. He married Rutilia, the sister of Publius Rutilius Rufus, consul in 105, and their three sons Marcus, Gaius, and Lucius became consuls in 74, 75, and 65 respectively.
* Aurelia L. f. L. n., the wife of Gaius Julius Caesar, proconsul of Asia early in the first century BC, and mother of the dictator Caesar.
* Lucius Aurelius (L. f. L. n.) Cotta, in 105 BC and tribune of the plebs &quot;circa&quot; 103; he tried to obstruct the prosecution of Quintus Servilius Caepio by the tribune Gaius Norbanus, but failed. He was praetor in an uncertain year; Broughton places his praetorship &quot;circa&quot; 95. Cicero describes him as a mediocre orator, who deliberately presented himself as a rustic.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. L. n. Cotta, consul in 74 BC, received the province of Bithynia during the war with Mithradates. He was defeated, and lost his entire fleet, for which he blamed his quaestor, Publius Oppius, whom Cicero defended. Cotta himself was later condemned for extortion in his province, on the accusation of Gaius Papirius Carbo.
* Gaius Aurelius M. f. L. n. Cotta, a distinguished orator, praised by Cicero. During the Social War, he had supported the cause of the allies, and was subsequently exiled until 82 BC. Consul in 75, he attempted to reverse one of Sulla&#x27;s most onerous laws, arousing the ire of the optimates. He was granted a triumph for his successes as proconsul of Gaul, but died from an old wound on the day before the ceremony.
* Lucius Aurelius M. f. L. n. Cotta, as praetor in 70 BC, carried the , expanding the classes of persons who could serve on juries. He became consul in 65, after accusing the consuls elect of &quot;ambitus&quot;, and became a target of the First Catilinarian conspiracy. He was censor in 64, but the tribunes of the plebs compelled him to resign. He was an ally of both Cicero and Caesar.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. M. n. Cotta, son of the consul of 74 BC, upon assuming the toga virilis, avenged his father by charging Carbo, his father&#x27;s accuser, of extortion in his province, the same crime for which the elder Cotta had been condemned. Probably the same Cotta who as propraetor of Sardinia in 49, fled to Africa before the arrival of Caesar&#x27;s legate, Quintus Valerius Orca.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. M. n. Cotta, probably a son of the propraetor Marcus, adopted a son of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, who became &quot;Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus&quot;.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. M. n. Cotta Maximus Messalinus, son of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, was adopted into the gens Aurelia. He was consul in AD 20, and an intimate friend of the emperor Tiberius. He gained a reputation for hostility and cruelty, causing a number of leading senators to accuse him of &quot;majestas&quot;. The emperor, however, defended him in a missive to the senate, whereupon Messalinus was acquitted. He was also the patron of Ovid.
* Aurelius M. f. M. n. Cotta, a nobleman who received an annual stipend from the Emperor Nero in AD 58, because he had dissipated his family estate in profligacy. He was doubtless the son of Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus.

===Aurelii Scauri===
* Gaius Aurelius Scaurus, praetor in 186 BC, was assigned the province of Sardinia.
* Marcus Aurelius M. f. Scaurus, in 118 BC, perhaps the same as the consul of 108.
* Marcus Aurelius Scaurus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in 108 BC. As a legate in Gaul in 105, he was defeated and captured by the Cimbri at the Battle of Arausio. Scaurus was slain by the Cimbric chief, Boiorix, when he warned his captors that they could not hope to defeat Rome.
* Marcus Aurelius (M. f.) Scaurus, a quaestor mentioned in Cicero&#x27;s oration against Verres.

===Aurelii Orestides===
* Lucius Aurelius L. f. L. n. Orestes, consul in 157 BC.
* Lucius Aurelius L. f. L. n. Orestes, consul in 126 BC, was sent against the Sardinians, over whom he triumphed in 122. Gaius Gracchus and Marcus Aurelius Scaurus served under his command. Orestes and his brother, Gaius, were orators mentioned in passing by Cicero.
* Gaius Aurelius L. f. L. n. Orestes, and his brother, Lucius, were orators briefly mentioned by Cicero.
* Lucius Aurelius L. f. L. n. Orestes, consul in 103 BC, with Gaius Marius as his colleague. Orestes died during his year of office.
* Gnaeus Aurelius Orestes, &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; in 77 BC, issued a decision that was appealed to the consul Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus. Lepidus sustained the appeal, negating Orestes&#x27; decision. Broughton identifies him with the consul of 71.
* Gnaeus Aurelius Cn. f. Orestes, adopted by Gnaeus Aufidius, the historian, assuming the name of Gnaeus Aufidius Orestes. After he failed to win election as tribune of the plebs, he succeeded in obtaining the consulship for 71 BC. Cicero, however, suggests that his election was due largely to the lavish gifts that he distributed among the people.
* Aurelia Orestilla, the second wife of Catiline, who reputedly slew his grown son in order to overcome her objection to their marriage. According to Cicero&#x27;s correspondent, Marcus Caelius Rufus, Aurelia&#x27;s daughter was betrothed to Quintus Cornificius.

===Aurelii Fulvi===
* Titus Aurelius Fulvus, the grandfather of the emperor Antoninus Pius, was legate of the third legion during the reign of Nero, and subsequently a supporter of Vespasian, under whom he served as consul &quot;suffectus circa&quot; AD 71, and governor of Hispania Citerior from 75 to 78. He was consul for the second time in 85, together with the emperor Domitian. At one time, he was &quot;praefectus urbi&quot;.

* Titus Aurelius T. f. T. n. Fulvus, afterwards Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius, emperor from AD 138 to 161. He had been consul in AD 120, then distinguished himself as Proconsul of Asia, and was adopted by Hadrian shortly before the emperor&#x27;s death.
* Marcus Aurelius T. f. T. n. Fulvus Antoninus, a son of Antoninus Pius, who must have died before AD 138, as Antoninus had no living sons when he was adopted by Hadrian.
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius T. f. T. n. Antoninus, another son of Antoninus Pius, must also have died before AD 138.
* Aurelia T. f. T. n. Fadilla, daughter of Antoninus Pius, and wife of Lucius Aelius Lamia Silvanus, died shortly after her father was appointed governor of Asia.
* Anna Galeria T. f. T. n. Faustina, another daughter of Antoninus Pius, married her cousin, Marcus Aurelius, and was empress from AD 161 to her death, about 175. She was noted for her extravagance and intrigues, which the emperor appears to have indulged, or at least tolerated.
* Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, born Marcus Annius Verus, a nephew of Antoninus Pius, by whom he was adopted on the orders of Hadrian in AD 138, and whom he succeeded as emperor from 161 to 180.
* Lucius Aurelius Verus, born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, was adopted by Antoninus Pius upon the latter&#x27;s adoption by Hadrian in AD 138. He was appointed emperor together with Marcus Aurelius in 161, reigning until his death in 169.
* Annia Aurelia M. f. Galeria Lucilla, daughter of Marcus Aurelius, married the emperor Lucius Verus. When he died young, a rumour began that Lucilla had poisoned him. Her second husband was the general Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, whom she despised as her inferior. She joined a plot against her brother, the emperor Commodus, but after being detected was banished to Capreae, where she was put to death about AD 183.
* Annia Galeria M. f. Aurelia Faustina, daughter of Marcus Aurelius, and wife of Gnaeus Claudius Severus, consul in AD 167. Their son, Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus, was consul in 200.
* Titus Aelius Aurelius M. f., son of Marcus Aurelius, probably died young.
* Titus Aurelius M. f. Fulvus Antoninus Geminus, son of Marcus Aurelius and twin brother of Commodus, died at the age of four, &quot;circa&quot; AD 165.
* Domitia M. f. Faustina, daughter of Marcus Aurelius, apparently died young.
* Lucius Aurelius M. f. Commodus Antoninus, son of Marcus Aurelius, emperor from AD 177 to 192. After a promising beginning, he gave himself over to luxury, self-indulgence, and tyranny. He was assassinated at the end of 192.

* Vibia Aurelia M. f. Sabina, daughter of Marcus Aurelius, married Lucius Antistius Burrus.

* Quintus Fabius Q. f. L. n. Memmius Symmachus, held a number of high offices, including the quaestorship and praetorship, before becoming proconsul of Africa in AD 415. He was &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in AD 418.

<text>Le Verrier is a small lunar impact crater located in the northern part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after French mathematician and astronomer Urbain Le Verrier. To the west is the slightly larger crater Helicon, and farther to the west-northwest lies the mountain-ringed bay Sinus Iridum.

Le Verrier, sometimes written Leverrier, is a bowl-shaped feature with a nearly circular rim. The inner walls display the appearance of slumping along the upper edges. The inner wall and floor to the southeast appears more irregular than elsewhere.

Chang&#x27;e 3 landed north of Le Verrier in December 2013.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Le Verrier.

<doc id="1003573" wikidata="Q1822997" url="?curid=1003573" title="Liberty bond">
<text>A liberty bond or liberty loan was a war bond that was sold in the United States to support the Allied cause in World War I. Subscribing to the bonds became a symbol of patriotic duty in the United States and introduced the idea of financial securities to many citizens for the first time.

== Liberty Bond issues 1917–1918 ==
There were four issues of Liberty Bonds:
* April 24, 1917: Emergency Loan Act () authorizes issue of $1.9 billion in bonds at 3.5 percent.
* October 1, 1917: Second Liberty Loan offers $3.8 billion in bonds at 4 percent
* April 5, 1918: Third Liberty Loan offers $4.1 billion in bonds at 4.15 percent.
* September 28, 1918: Fourth Liberty Loan offers $6.9 billion in bonds at 4.25 percent.

Interest on up to $30,000 in the bonds was tax exempt only for the First Liberty Bond.

==First Liberty Bond Act==
The Emergency Loan Act established a $5 billion aggregate limit on the amount of government bonds issued at 30 years at 3.5% interest, redeemable by the government after 15 years. It raised $2 billion with 5.5 million people purchasing bonds.

==Second Liberty Bond Act==

The 2nd Liberty Loan Act established a $15 billion aggregate limit on the amount of government bonds issued, allowing $3 billion more offered at 25 years at 4% interest, redeemable after 10 years. The amount of the loan totaled $3.8 billion with 9.4 million people purchasing bonds.

==Sales difficulties and the subsequent campaign==

The response to the first Liberty Bond was unenthusiastic and although the $2 billion issue reportedly sold out, it probably had to be done below par because the notes traded consistently below par. One reaction to this was to attack bond traders as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; if they sold below par. The Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange conducted an investigation of brokerage firms who sold below par to determine if &quot;pro-German influences&quot; were at work. The board forced one such broker to buy the bonds back at par and make a $100,000 donation to the Red Cross. Various explanations were offered for the weakness of the bonds ranging from German sabotage to the rich not buying the bonds because it would give an appearance of tax dodging (the bonds were exempt from some taxes).
A common consensus was that more needed to be done to sell the bonds to small investors and the common man, rather than large concerns. The poor reception of the first issue resulted in a convertible re-issue five months later at the higher interest rate of 4% and with more favorable tax terms. When the new issue arrived it also sold below par, although the Times noted that &quot;no Government bonds can sell at par except temporarily and by accident.&quot; The subsequent 4.25% bond priced as low as 94 cents upon arrival.

Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo reacted to the sales problems by creating an aggressive campaign to popularize the bonds. The government used a division of the Committee on Public Information called the Four Minute Men to help sell Liberty Bonds and Thrift Stamps. Famous artists helped to make posters and movie and stage stars hosted bond rallies. Harry Lauder, Al Jolson, Elsie Janis, Mary Pickford, Theda Bara, Ethel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, Lillian Gish, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin were among the celebrities that made public appearances promoting the idea that purchasing a liberty bond was &quot;the patriotic thing to do&quot; during the era. Chaplin also made a short film, &quot;The Bond&quot;, at his own expense for the drive. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts sold the bonds, using the slogan &quot;Every Scout to Save a Soldier&quot;.

Beyond these effective efforts, in 1917 the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps established an elite group of Army pilots assigned to the Liberty Bond campaign. The plan for selling bonds was for the pilots to crisscross the country in their Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; training aircraft in flights of 3 to 5 aircraft. When they arrived over a town, they would perform aerobatic stunts, and put on mock dog fights for the populace.

After performing their air show, they would land on a road, a golf course, or a pasture nearby. By the time they shut down their engines, most of the townspeople, attracted by their performance, would have gathered. At that point, most people had never seen an airplane, nor ridden in one. Routinely each pilot stood in the rear cockpit of his craft and told the assemblage that every person who purchased a Liberty Bond would be taken for a ride in one of the airplanes. The program raised a substantial amount of money. The methodology developed and practiced by the Army was later followed by numerous entrepreneurial flyers known as Barnstormers, who purchased war surplus Jenny airplanes and flew across the country selling airplane rides.


Vast amounts of promotional materials were manufactured. For example, for the third Liberty Loan nine million posters, five million window stickers and 10 million buttons were produced and distributed. The campaign spurred community efforts across the country and resulted in glowing, patriotically-tinged reports on the &quot;success&quot; of the bonds. For the fifth and final loan drive (the Victory Loan) in 1919 the Treasury Department produced steel medallions made from melted down German cannon that had been captured by American troops at Château-Thierry in NW France. The inch-and-a-quarter wide medallions suspended from a red, white, and blue ribbon were awarded by the Department to Victory Liberty Loan campaign volunteers in appreciation of their service in the drive.

Despite all these measures, recent research has shown that patriotic motives played only a minor role in investors&#x27; decisions to buy these bonds.

Through the selling of &quot;Liberty bonds,&quot; the government raised around $17 billion for the war effort. Considering that there were approximately 100 million Americans at the time, each American, on average, raised $170 on Liberty bonds.

According to the Massachusetts Historical Society, &quot;Because the first World War cost the federal government more than $30 billion (by way of comparison, total federal expenditures in 1913 were only $970 million), these programs became vital as a way to raise funds&quot;.

Peak US indebtedness was in August 1919 at a value of $25,596,000,000 for Liberty Bonds, Victory Notes, War Savings Certificates, and other government securities. As early as 1922 the possibility that the war debt could not be paid in full within the expected schedule was raised, and that debt rescheduling may be needed. In 1921 the Treasury Department began issuing short term notes maturing in three to five years to repay the Victory Loan.

==Victory Liberty Loan==
A fifth bond issue relating to World War I was released on April 21, 1919. Consisting of $4.5 billion of gold notes at 4.75% interest, they matured after four years but could be redeemed by the government after three. Exempt from all income taxes, they were called at the time &quot;the last of the series of five Liberty Loans.&quot; However they were also called the &quot;Victory Liberty Loan,&quot; and appear this way on posters of the period.

==Repayment==
The first three bonds and the Victory Loan were partially retired during the course of the 1920s, but the majority of these bonds were simply re-financed through other government securities. The Victory Loan, which was to mature in May 1923, was retired with money raised by short term treasury notes which matured after three to five years and issued at 90-day intervals until sufficient funds were raised in 1921. The likelihood of successfully retiring all of the war debt (within the amount of time) was noted as early as 1921. In 1927, the 2nd and 3rd, together worth five billion dollars (25% of all government debt at the time), were called for redemption and refunded through the issuance of other government securities through the Treasury Department. Some of the principal was retired. For example, of the 3.1 billion dollars owed on the 2nd Liberty Bond, 575 million in principal was retired and the rest refinanced. At this same time, the 1st Liberty Bond still had 1.9 billion dollars outstanding in 1927 with a call date for 1932 while the fourth Liberty Bond, with six billion dollars, had a call date for 1932 as well.

==Default of the Fourth Liberty Bond==

The first three Liberty bonds, and the Victory Loan, were retired during the course of the 1920s. However, because the terms of the bonds allowed them to be traded for the later bonds which had superior terms, most of the debt from the first, second, and third Liberty bonds was rolled into the fourth issue.

The fourth Liberty Bond had the following terms:

*Date of Bond: October 24, 1918
*Coupon Rate: 4.25%
*Callable Starting: October 15, 1933
*Maturity Date: October 15, 1938
*Amount Originally Tendered: $6 billion
*Amount Sold: $7 billion

The terms of the bond included: &quot;The principal and interest hereof are payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value.&quot; This type of &quot;gold clause&quot; was common in both public and private contracts of the time, and was intended to guarantee that bond-holders would not be harmed by a devaluation of the currency.

However, when the US Treasury called the fourth bond on April 15, 1934, it defaulted on this term by refusing to redeem the bond in gold, and neither did it account for the devaluation of the dollar from $20.67 per troy ounce of gold (the 1918 standard of value) to $35 per ounce. The 21 million bond holders therefore lost 139 million troy ounces of gold, or approximately 41% of the bond&#x27;s principal.

The legal basis for the refusal of the US Treasury to redeem in gold was the gold clause resolution (Pub. Res. 73–10), dated June 5, 1933. The Supreme Court later held the gold clause resolution to be unconstitutional under section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

However, due to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s elimination of the open gold market with the signing of Executive Order 6102 on April 5, 1933, the Court ruled that the bond-holders&#x27; loss was unquantifiable, and that to repay them in dollars according to the 1918 standard of value would be an &quot;unjustified enrichment&quot;. The ruling therefore had little practical effect.

==Impact==
According to a 2020 study, &quot;counties with higher liberty bond ownership rates turned against the Democratic Party in the presidential elections of 1920 and 1924. This was a reaction to the depreciation of the bonds prior to the 1920 election (when the Democrats held the presidency) and the appreciation of the bonds in the early 1920s (under a Republican president), as the Federal Reserve raised and then subsequently lowered interest rates.&quot;

<text>The continent of Africa is commonly divided into five regions or subregions, four of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.

== List of subregions in Africa ==
The five United Nation subregions:

* Northern Africa
* Sub-Saharan Africa
** Eastern Africa
** Middle Africa
** Southern Africa
** Western Africa

==Directional approach==
One common approach categorizes Africa directionally, e.g., by cardinal direction (compass direction):
*North Africa lies north of the Sahara and runs along the Mediterranean coast.
*West Africa is the portion roughly west of 10° east longitude, excluding Northern Africa and the Maghreb. West Africa contains large portions of the Sahara Desert and the Adamawa Mountains.
*East Africa stretches from the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa to Mozambique, including Madagascar.
*Central Africa is the large mass at the center of Africa which either does not fall squarely into any other region or only partially does so.
*Southern Africa consists of the portion generally south of -10° latitude and the great rainforests of Congo.

This approach is taken, for example, in the United Nations geoscheme for Africa and the regions of the African Union.

==Physiographic approach==

Another common approach divides Aregions, or vegetation types:
*Nubia (Lower Nubia) (Upper Nubia)
*Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt
*The Maghreb is a region of northwest Africa encompassing the coastlands and Atlas Mountains of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.
*The Sahara Desert is the massive sparsely populated region in North Africa that contains the world&#x27;s largest hot deserts 
*Sub-Saharan Africa is the area of the African continent which lies south of the Sahara.
*The Sahel region covers a belt of grasslands south of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Sudan.
*The Sudan, slightly more humid and arable region lying below the Sahel.
**Sudanian Savanna
** Sudd
*The Horn of Africa is a peninsula in East Africa that juts for hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea, and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. It encompasses Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti.
** Ethiopian Highlands (Roof of Africa)
* Nigritia or Negroland
* The Guinea region is distinguished from the neighboring Sudan region by its rainforests and runs along the Atlantic coast from Guinea to Nigeria.
** Upper, Middle, Lower and Forest
** Gold Coast, Slave Coast, Ivory Coast and Pepper Coast
* Rhodesia (region) (Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia)
* Mayombe
* The Congo Basin is the rainforest region
* The Chad Basin is the largest endorheic drainage basin in Africa, centered on Lake Chad.
* East African Rift. The region contains Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda.
**Eastern Rift mountains
**Rift Valley Lakes
**African Great Lakes
* Swahili Coast
* Barbary Coast
* Skeleton Coast
* Great Escarpment
* Karoo
* Bushveld
* Mittelafrika
* Igboland (Mbaise)
* Maputaland
* Azania
* Kalahari
* Borkou
* Ouaddaï
* Agadez
* Azawad
* Kanem
* Darfur
* Bahr el Ghazal
* Equatoria
* Greater Upper Nile
* Kordofan
* The Cape (Dutch Cape colony, Cape colony)
* Bushmanland
* Natal
* Griqualand
* Veld

*For mountain ranges, refer to: Africa
*For deserts, refer to: Africa
*Kivu

==Linguistic approach==


===By official language===

*Anglophone Africa includes five countries in West Africa (The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, and the most populous African country Nigeria, as well as a part of Cameroon) that are separated by Francophone countries, South Sudan, and a large continuous area in Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes.
*Arabophone Africa includes the four most populous Arabic-speaking countries (Egypt, the Sudan, Morocco, Algeria) as well as Tunisia, Mauritania and Chad, and includes a majority of both the population and the area of the Arabic-speaking countries. French has also kept a strong role in the Maghreb countries, though this has receded somewhat with official Arabization.
*Francophone Africa is a continuous area in West Africa and Central Africa, plus Madagascar and Djibouti.
*Lusophone Africa consists of the widely separated countries of Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Angola, and Mozambique.
*Equatorial Guinea is the only African country where the Spanish language is official, though French is co-official (but rarely spoken).
*Swahili is widely used as an inter language in East Africa; its use for official and educational functions is greatest in Tanzania.
*Ethiopia and Somalia use the Afro-Asiatic Amharic and Somali languages, respectively, as their official languages, although Arabic also serves as a secondary language in Somalia. Eritrea and some parts of Ethiopia use the Tigrinya language as a working language and Arabic language as a non-indigenous working language within Eritrea.

===By indigenous language family===
*Niger–Congo languages and Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan occupies a smaller area but is highly diverse, and may be related as a parent or sibling of Niger–Congo.
*Afro-Asiatic languages are spoken in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, as well as parts of the Sahel.
*Khoisan languages are spoken in desert areas of Southern Africa, but were formerly spoken over a larger area, and are thought to include two small languages (Hadza and Sandawe) in the African Great Lakes.
*Austronesian languages originating from Southeast Asia are spoken in Madagascar.

==Investment approach==
A slightly less common, but equally important method of division of the continent is by investment factors. For the purposes of investing, Africa is not a single destination with a single set of standardized risk factors and homogeneous potential for reward. Although some high-level similarities are evident, digging into the specifics of certain regions and countries shows that Africa comprises a range of distinct investment destinations, each with its own attractions, flaws, cultural differences and business practices.

The investment approach was first developed by global, independent financial analytics provider and investment consultant, RisCura:

* The Maghreb region
*: Otherwise known as the western portion of Northern Africa, these countries form the Arab Maghreb Union, established in 1989. The region was established with the goal of functioning as a unified political and economic grouping. Political unrest in the region has stunted progress since its inception but hope still remains that the Union will fulfill its purpose in years to come. Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara are included in this region.
* Egypt and the Sudan
*: Previously united under British rule, these countries still share strong ties, as well as one significant commonality – the trade facilitation through transport on the Nile River. As Egypt does not fall within the Arab Maghreb Union, it is separated from the rest of North Africa. However, Egypt&#x27;s strong economic and cultural ties with the Middle East bring natural trading partners, and it is often seen grouped with the Middle East for investment purposes.
* Francophone West Africa 
*: This is a commonly recognized region on the continent, and typically includes Mauritania. However, Mauritania is sometimes allocated to the Maghreb region as it is found to have closer ties to the North African countries. These French-speaking countries share more than just a language. Due to their common history as French colonies, they also share similar legal and socio-political systems. The countries in this group are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, the Niger, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, and Togo.
* Nigeria
*: On its own, Nigeria is the size of the entire Maghreb region on an aggregated-GDP basis. While Nigeria is traditionally grouped with the rest of West Africa, its reliance on the rest of the region is less pronounced, likely as a result of its massive standalone GDP, its access to international markets via its six large ports, and its population of over 170 million people.
* East Africa
*: This is a combination of the East African Community (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda), the LAPSSET corridor (Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan) as well as Djibouti, a crucial link to the Indian Ocean for Ethiopia and South Sudan. Kenya has traditionally headlined this region through consistently generating the largest GDP and acts as the primary route to international trade through the Mombasa port. 
* Central Africa 
*: This market is the same as that defined by the African Development Bank with the exception of Madagascar, which here is classified as Southern Africa (ex-SA). On a GDP basis (USD) and by population, the Central Africa region is on par with the Francophone West African region. Countries included here are Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, the DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon.
* Southern Africa excluding South Africa (ex-SA)
*: This incorporates countries south of central and eastern Africa, and north of the South African border. The region has support from the most developed economy on the continent from the south, and access to capital coming out of South Africa as large companies look to expand into the rest of the continent. The group comprises Angola (which offers substantial oil resources), Botswana, the Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Réunion (France), Zambia (substantial supply of copper), and Zimbabwe.
* South Africa
*: Like Nigeria, South Africa is a large African economy on a standalone basis. Due to the developed nature of South Africa relative to the rest of the continent, it has not been included in the Southern African region. South Africa boasts the largest GDP per capita of all the regions (double that of Nigeria) and is the most advanced investment destination on the continent. The South African market includes Eswatini and Lesotho due to their reliance and proximity to SA. The Swazi lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand, which is also accepted as currency within the country.
* Other West Africa
*: This region includes The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

<text>Landau is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It was named after physicist Lev Landau. The crater Wegener is attached to the northeastern rim. Attached to the southeastern rim is Frost.

The outer rim of Landau is heavily eroded and modified by subsequent impacts. The most notable of these is Wood, which overlays the northwest rim. Much of the floor is hilly and irregular, with only the northeast quadrant being somewhat level. There are multiple small craters and craterlets in the floor. The most intact section of the rim is in the southwest, although this is now little more than a low ridge line.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Landau was called &quot;Crater 97&quot;.

Landau lies at the approximate margin of the Coulomb-Sarton Basin, a 530 km wide impact crater of Pre-Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Landau.

<text>La Condamine is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the southern edge of the Mare Frigoris, in the northern part of the Moon. It lies to the northeast of the mountain-rimmed Sinus Iridum formation in the northwest part of the Mare Imbrium.

The crater rim is low and rounded, with the edge worn and eroded along the northeast side. The outer wall is somewhat polygonal, particularly in the southwestern half. The interior is fairly flat with no central peak, but there is a low curved, double rille in the western half that reaches toward the northern rim.

La Condamine is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

<text>Theodorus Bailey (April 12, 1805 – February 10, 1877) was a United States Navy officer during the American Civil War.

==Early career==
Bailey was born at Chateaugay, New York in the far north-eastern corner of Franklin County, near the border with Quebec. He received his early education at Plattsburgh, before being appointed a midshipman at the beginning of 1818 at age 12. He saw his first sea duty in the frigate between 1819 and 1821 when she cruised to the western coast of Africa to protect the new colony of former slaves recently established by the United States. On the return voyage, he saw service in the campaign to suppress the West Indian pirates. In 1821, Bailey transferred to the ship of the line and served in her during her entire cruise as flagship for the Pacific station, which lasted until 1824. His last tour of duty as a midshipman came between 1824 and 1826 when he voyaged back to the West Indies in the schooner to protect shipping from pirates again.

In 1827, he moved to duty in the receiving ship at New York. It was while in this assignment that he received his commission as a lieutenant on March 3, 1827, after almost a decade of service. Next, he served briefly in the sloop and in the schooner in 1831, before being assigned to in June 1833 for a three-year cruise around the world in search of shipwrecked and stranded American seamen. Returning to the east coast in June 1836, Bailey saw duty in the ship-of-the-line before going ashore for a two-year tour at the New York Navy Yard from 1838 to 1840. Bailey returned to sea in the frigate between 1840 and 1844. During that period, his ship served an extended tour on the East India station and carried Bailey on his second circumnavigation of the world. After returning from the East Indies, he went ashore again and spent time in 1845 and 1846 engaged in recruiting duty at the Rendezvous in New York.

==Mexican–American War==
After the Mexican War broke out in the spring of 1846, Bailey assumed his first command, the sloop , that summer. He embarked an artillery company at New York and set sail for the Pacific coast. Sailing by way of Cape Horn and La Paz, Chile, his ship arrived on the California coast late in the year. During the closing phase of the war Bailey led his command in a blockade of the coast around San Blas in Lower California and even made a successful raid on the town in January 1847, capturing several pieces of ordnance in the process.

In October 1848, Bailey left &quot;Lexington&quot; on the west coast to go ashore on a leave of absence from the service. He remained ashore waiting orders for almost five years, during which time on March 6, 1849, he received his promotion to commander. Finally, in 1853, he received orders to command the sloop of war then under repair at Philadelphia. In her, Bailey cruised to the eastern and southern Pacific during 1854, 1855, and 1856, receiving his promotion to captain on December 15, 1855. Relieved at Panama on December 16, 1856, Bailey spent the four years immediately preceding the Civil War ashore, first on some unspecified special duty and then awaiting orders.

==American Civil War==
The outbreak of the American Civil War brought Bailey the orders he sought. On June 3, 1861, he put the steam frigate back in commission at Boston and set sail a fortnight later to join the Gulf Blockading Squadron. &quot;Colorado&quot; arrived at Key West on July 9 and at Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island off Pensacola on the 15th. There, &quot;Colorado &quot; became flagship of the Gulf Blockading Squadron on 16 July when Flag Officer William Mervine embarked.
Bailey patrolled the waters off the Florida Panhandle until mid-November at which time his ship moved to a blockade station off the Mississippi Delta. Though Bailey technically retained command of &quot;Colorado&quot; until the beginning of May 1862, he was performing other duties in conjunction with the assault on the defenses of New Orleans by April 1862. When the push to take the city went off on April 24, Bailey commanded one of the gunboat divisions during the fight to pass Forts Jackson and St. Philip. Once that feat had been accomplished, he continued on upriver to demand the city&#x27;s surrender on the 25th. Bailey and Lieutenant George Perkins walked to city hall despite armed civilians crowding around them, shouting threats. Mayor John Monroe refused to surrender the city, but as Confederate troops had already evacuated, the Union soon occupied New Orleans.

Bailey relinquished command of &quot;Colorado&quot; officially on May 1, 1862, and returned north with dispatches. Promoted to commodore on July 16, 1862, Bailey commanded the station at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York, through the summer of 1862. Heading south again in November 1862, Bailey relieved Acting Rear Admiral James L. Lardner as flag officer commanding the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. He held that post until the summer of 1864 when, after a bout of yellow fever, he was transferred to duty as the commandant at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. About halfway through that assignment, he received his promotion to rear admiral on July 25, 1866. Though placed on the retired list on October 10, 1866, Rear Admiral Bailey served as the commandant at Portsmouth until the latter part of 1867.

Admiral Bailey was a member of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Rear Admiral Bailey died at Washington, D. C., on February 10, 1877. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Other work==
Bailey was instrumental in developing a primitive &quot;thruster system,&quot; the principles of which are still in use today. A pipe could direct water to one side of the ship or another, which caused the ship to be able to move with more agility in the high seas. Today, ships use this principle in thruster systems.

==Namesakes==
Three ships have been named for him.

<doc id="1003602" wikidata="Q2331833" url="?curid=1003602" title="Couldn't Stand the Weather">
<text>Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather is the second studio album by American blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. It was released on May 15, 1984, by Epic Records as the follow-up to the band&#x27;s critically and commercially successful 1983 album, &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. Recording sessions took place in January 1984 at the Power Station in New York City.

Stevie Ray Vaughan wrote half the tracks on &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;. The album reached No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the music video for &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot; received regular rotation on MTV. The album received mostly positive reviews, with AllMusic giving it a four out of five stars. It received praise for Vaughan’s playing and highlighted songs such as &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; and &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;, but received criticism for the lack of original songs.

In 1999, a reissue of the album was released which contains an audio interview segment and four studio outtakes. In 2010, the album was reissued as a &quot;Legacy Edition&quot; containing two CDs with a previously unreleased studio outtake and selections from an August 17, 1984, concert at The Spectrum in Montreal, Canada, originally recorded for the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; radio program.

==Recording and production==
During January 1984, Vaughan and Double Trouble spent 19 days at the Power Station recording studio in New York City. John Hammond was executive producer and supervised the sessions. The album was produced by the band along with Richard Mullen and Jim Capfer. The album was engineered by Mullen and Rob Eaton. Graphic artist Holland MacDonald designed the album cover art with assistance from Shostal Associates for the tornado image, a photograph of the 1957 Fargo tornado.

==Reception==

The album was another commercial success for Stevie Ray Vaughan, selling 1,000,000 copies within five weeks. In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote: &quot;
Robert Christgau wrote in his review that &quot;Though he comes close sometimes, this Texan ain&#x27;t Hendrix. But between earned Jimi cover and lyric refreshment, album two is almost everything a reasonable person might hope from him: a roadhouse album with gargantuan sonic imagination.&quot;

<text>Hohmann is a lunar impact crater that lies within the central basin of the Mare Orientale formation, on the farside of the Moon. It is located to the south of the crater Maunder, and to the west of Kopff crater. Due to its proximity to the western lunar limb, this area of the surface is occasionally visible during favorable librations. However the basin is viewed from the side, restricting the amount of detail that can be observed from Earth.

The rim of this crater is circular and only marginally worn, with a pair of tiny impacts overlaying the southern edge. An outer rampart slopes down to the surrounding surface, and the interior wall slopes down more sharply to the crater floor. There is a terrace along the southeastern interior wall. Portions of the surroundings show evidence of ejecta deposits from Maunder to the north (as shown by a number of secondary impacts). Some of this ejecta may have been deposited within the interior of Hohmann.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hohmann.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Hohmann T — &quot;See&quot; Il&#x27;in.

<text>was a Japanese writer, editor and translator. His works like &quot;Geisha in Rivalry&quot; and &quot;A Strange Tale from East of the River&quot; are noted for their depictions of life of the demimonde in early 20th-century Tokyo.

==Biography==

Nagai was born Sōkichi Nagai () in Koishikawa, Bunkyō, Tokyo, as the eldest son of government official Kyūichirō Nagai and his wife Tsune, the daughter of scholar Washizu Kidō. His father was an elite government official in the Home Ministry, who had studied as an exchange student in the United States and also wrote and published Chinese poetry. Kyūichirō later left his Ministry occupation to work for the Nippon Yusen shipping company. When the second son was born in 1883, Nagai was sent to live with his maternal grandmother until 1886. During his childhood, he visited a Chinese language school, and, under his mother&#x27;s influence, was taught singing and playing music instruments, showing a fondness for utazawa, a late Edo era style of singing accompanied by the shamisen. Starting in 1890, he was also taught English language.

Due to illness, Nagai spent several months in 1895 in a hospital in Odawara. From 1897 on, he started his regular visits to the Yoshiwara red-light district, accompanied by his friend and writer Seiichi Inoue (1878–1923). The same year, he graduated from Junior High School. With his mother and younger brothers, he visited Shanghai, where his father was working for Nippon Yusen. He returned to Japan in Autumn and enrolled in the Tokyo School of Foreign Languages.
In 1898, he published his first short story &quot;Sudare no tsuki&quot;. He became a disciple of novelist Hirotsu Ryūrō and writer Fukuchi Ōchi, studied rakugo and kabuki play writing, appeared on stage in yose plays, and dropped out of University. His writings were influenced by French Naturalism and Émile Zola, whose work he also translated. Between 1903 and 1908, through his father&#x27;s influence, Nagai visited the United States and later France, a time which he wrote down in his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Amerika monogatari&quot;) and &quot;Furansu monogatari&quot; (lit. &quot;French Stories&quot;). The 1908 publication of &quot;American Stories&quot; met with much critical acclaim.

In 1910, Nagai started teaching as a professor of literature at Keio University and became the editor of the literary magazine &quot;Mita Bungaku&quot;. At this time, he had already turned away from Naturalism and taken a shift towards Aestheticism. The transition from the Meiji era to the Taishō era was also a turning point in Nagai&#x27;s life: the death of his father, the divorce from both his first and second wife (the second marriage—to a geisha—led to the alienation of his mother), and the resigning from his position at Keio University and &quot;Mita Bungaku&quot;. A frequenter of Tokyo&#x27;s demimonde, Nagai wrote many stories about its inhabitants, geisha, courtesans and their customers, most notably &quot;Geisha in Rivalry&quot; (1916–17). 

After a decade-long hiatus, he published the novellas &quot;During the Rains&quot; (1931), &quot;Flowers in the Shade&quot; (1934) and &quot;A Strange Tale from East of the River&quot; (1937), with the latter having repeatedly been cited as his major work. His contempt for the militarist regime, which in turn regarded his work as subversive for the war effort, led to a halt of the publishing of his writings until the end of World War II. The publication of his diaries (1917–1959) ranks as the major literary event of his post-war career.

In 1952, Nagai received the Order of Culture, and in 1954, he was elected a member of the Japan Art Academy. He died on 30 April 1959.

<text>Soul to Soul is the third studio album by American blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble released on September 30, 1985, by Epic Records. Recording sessions took place between March and May 1985 at the Dallas Sound Lab in Dallas, Texas. Vaughan wrote four of &quot;Soul to Soul&quot;&#x27;s ten tracks; two songs were released as singles. The album went to #34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the music video for &quot;Change It&quot; received regular rotation on MTV. In 1999, a reissue of the album was released, which includes an audio interview segment and two studio outtakes.

&quot;Soul to Soul&quot; received generally positive reviews, with acclaim for Vaughan’s style and playing, and criticism for a lack of inspiration and Vaughan’s “hit or miss songwriting.”

In 1999, a reissue of the album was released which contains an audio interview segment and studio outtakes. In 2014, Analogue Productions Remaster used the original master tape for the first time since the first CD edition. The lyrics before the guitar solo on &quot;Life Without You&quot; have been restored audibly, whereas on other CD editions since 1999 they had been edited out.
