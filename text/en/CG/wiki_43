<text>Nettleham is a village and civil parish within the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, north-east of Lincoln between the A46 and A158.

The population of the civil parish was 3,437 at the 2011 census.

==History==
The now-demolished Bishop&#x27;s Manor House at Nettleham was the property of Edith of Wessex, wife of Edward the Confessor and later Empress Matilda, daughter of King Henry I, before passing into the possession of the Bishops of Lincoln, who enlarged it to create a Bishop&#x27;s Palace appropriate to one of the country&#x27;s most important Sees. On 7 February 1301 King Edward I was staying in the Bishop&#x27;s Palace when he created his son Edward (later King Edward II) as the first Prince of Wales. The building was damaged during the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536 and completely demolished by 1650, only traces of foundations remaining on the site now called Bishop&#x27;s Palace Field.

The parish church of All Saints dates from the Saxon period, with medieval and 19th century additions. It is now in the benefice of Nettleham with Riseholme and Grange de Lings.
Within the church&#x27;s graveyard is a headstone in memory of Thomas Gardiner, a post-boy murdered hereabouts by two highway robbers in January 1733. The inscription declares he was &#x27;barbarously murdered&#x27; aged 19. The robbers - two brothers by the name of Hallam - committed another murder near Faldingworth before being arrested. They were convicted of murder at Lincoln and executed at the site of their crimes. (Thomas Gardiner&#x27;s headstone declares he was killed on 3 January 1732 since at the time Britain used the Julian Calendar.)

The Royal Society for Nature Conservation (RSNC) had been based in Nettleham but moved to Newark-on-Trent in 1999. The site became the home of the WATCH Trust for Environmental Conservation, but this also moved to Newark a few years later.

==Governance==
Since April 1974 Nettleham has formed part of the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire. It forms part of the Gainsborough parliamentary constituency which is represented by Sir Edward Leigh.

==Geography==
The parish boundary meets Greetwell on the A158 Horncastle/Wragby road. It follows the A15 Wragby Road into Lincoln for about where it meets Lincoln, and skirts the edge of the housing estate (Glebe Park) next to the bypass; the Lincoln bypass (A158) from the A46 to the A158 is in the parish. The boundary crosses Nettleham Road (B1182, former A46), south of the bypass roundabout, and follows south of the A46 bypass for about and meets Riseholme (south of the bypass). The bypass passes northwards skirting, the edge of the University of Lincoln&#x27;s Riseholme College. 550 yards north of Nettleham Hall, it meets Grange de Lings, and borders this parish along a farm track until the A46, where it meets Scothern just north of Nettleham Heath Farm. It crosses Scothern Beck north of Skelton House Farm, passes south, and at Nettleham Beck it meets Sudbrooke, crossing Sudbrooke Lane east of Richmond Farm. North of Manor Farm, it meets Reepham on the A158 Roman road and follows the A158 to North Greetwell, where it meets Greetwell.

==Community==
Nettleham has won the &quot;Best Kept Village Award&quot; several times, and the centre of the village is a conservation area. Large modern housing estates surround the old village centre. Nettleham is also the location of the Lincolnshire Police headquarters to the west of the village near the A46. It was opened by the Queen in 1980.

Village public houses are the Black Horse on Chapel Lane, the Plough on Church Street, and the White Hart on High Street.

The parish includes an oil well owned by Star Energy, north of the A158 bypass, which has been producing since 1985.

==Sport==
Nettleham F.C. have been members of the Lincolnshire League since their relegation from the Central Midlands League. They have twice played Aston Villa football club in friendlies. Nettleham Cricket Club play in the Lincolnshire ECB League. Both teams play their home fixtures at Mulsanne Park, Nettleham. The village also has a tennis club and has been the new home of Lincoln Rugby Football Club since 2014.

<text>These are the results of the Women&#x27;s coxless pair competition, one of six events for female competitors in Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

==Women&#x27;s Pair==
===Heats===
10 boats competed in two heats on 14 August, 2004. The top 3 pairs from each heat advanced to the final. 

===Heat 1===
===Heat 2===
===Final===
The Romanians never looked likely to lose as they led throughout. At 1,000 metres they were nearly two seconds clear of the Canadians who were half a second ahead of Belarus with world champions Great Britain a further second back. By 1,500 m. they had extended their lead with no change in positions in the trailing pack. Just after this mark Belarus and Great Britain both made a move to push past Canada who could not respond. The British kept their push going and passed the Belarusians and by the finishing line had just about overlapped the dominant Romanians. Belarus were two thirds of length back with a very tired looking Canada a further one and a half lengths away.

<doc id="987544" wikidata="Q208273" url="?curid=987544" title="NFPA 704">
<text>&quot;NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response&quot; is a standard maintained by the U.S.-based National Fire Protection Association. First &quot;tentatively adopted as a guide&quot; in 1960, and revised several times since then, it defines the &quot;Safety Square&quot; or &quot;Fire Diamond&quot; which is used to quickly and easily identify the risks posed by hazardous materials. This helps determine what, if any, special equipment should be used, procedures followed, or precautions taken during the initial stages of an emergency response. It is an internationally accepted safety standard, and is crucial while transporting chemicals.

==Codes==

The four divisions are typically color-coded with red on top indicating flammability, blue on the left indicating level of health hazard, yellow on the right for chemical reactivity, and white containing codes for special hazards. Each of health, flammability and reactivity is rated on a scale from 0 (no hazard) to 4 (severe hazard). The latest version of NFPA 704 sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the specifications of each classification are listed below. The numeric values in the first column are designated in the standard by &quot;Degree of Hazard&quot; using Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), not to be confused with other classification systems, such as that in the NFPA 30 Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, where flammable and combustible liquid categories are designated by &quot;Class&quot;, using Roman numerals (I, II, III).




==History==
The development of NFPA 704 is credited to the Charlotte Fire Department after a fire at the Charlotte Chemical Company in 1959 led to severe injuries to many of the firefighters. Upon arrival, the fire crew found a fire burning inside a vat that firefighters assumed to be burning kerosene. The crew tried to suppress the fire, which resulted in the vat exploding due to metallic sodium being stored in the kerosene. Thirteen firefighters were injured, several of whom had critical injuries while one lost both ears and most of his face from the incident.

At the time, such vats were not labelled with the materials they contained, so firefighters did not have the necessary information to recognize that hazardous materials were present, which required a specific response. In this case, sodium was able to react with water to release hydrogen gas and large amounts of heat, which has the potential to explode.

The Charlotte Fire Department developed training to respond to fires involving hazardous materials, ensured that protective clothing was available to those responding, and expanded the fire prevention inspection program. Fire Marshal J. F. Morris developed the diamond shaped placard as a marking system to indicate when a building contained hazardous materials, with their levels of flammability, reactivity and health effects.

<text>The Harmattan is a season in West Africa that occurs between the end of November and the middle of March. It is characterized by the dry and dusty northeasterly trade wind, of the same name, which blows from the Sahara over West Africa into the Gulf of Guinea. The name is related to the word in the Twi language. The temperature is cold mostly at night in some places but can be very hot in certain places during daytime. Generally, temperature differences can also depend on local circumstances.

The Harmattan blows during the dry season, which occurs during the months with the lowest sun. In this season, the subtropical ridge of high pressure stays over the central Sahara and the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) stays over the Gulf of Guinea. On its passage over the Sahara, the Harmattan picks fine dust and sand particles (between 0.5 and 10 microns). It is also known as the &quot;doctor wind&quot;, because of its invigorating dryness compared with humid tropical air.

==Effects==
This season differs from winter because it is characterized by cold, dry, dust-laden wind, and also wide fluctuations in the ambient temperatures of the day and night. Temperatures can easily be as low as all day, but sometimes in the afternoon the temperature can also soar to as high as , while the relative humidity drops under 5%. It can also be hot in some regions, like in the Sahara.

The air is particularly dry and desiccating when the Harmattan blows over the region. The Harmattan brings desert-like weather conditions: it lowers the humidity, dissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which can result in dust storms or sandstorms. The wind can increase fire risk and cause severe crop damage. The interaction of the Harmattan with monsoon winds can cause tornadoes.

===Harmattan haze===
In some countries in West Africa, the heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the sun for several days, comparable to a heavy fog. This effect is known as the Harmattan haze. It costs airlines millions of dollars in cancelled and diverted flights each year. When the haze is weak, the skies are clear. The extreme dryness of the air may cause branches of trees to die.

===Health===
A 2024 study found that dust carried by the Harmattan increases infant and child mortality, as well as has persistent adverse health impacts on surviving children.

Humidity can drop lower than 15%, which can result in spontaneous nosebleeds for some people. Other health effects on humans may include conditions of the skin (dryness of the skin), dried or chapped lips, eyes, and respiratory system, including aggravation of asthma.

<text>Padraic Colum (8 December 1881 – 11 January 1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer, playwright, children&#x27;s author and collector of folklore. He was one of the leading figures of the Irish Literary Revival.

==Early life==
Colum was born Patrick Columb in a County Longford workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb.

When his father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the Colorado gold rush. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland, having moved to live with his grandmother in County Cavan. When his father returned in 1892, the family moved to Glasthule, near Dublin, where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at Sandycove and Glasthule railway station. His son attended the local national school.

When Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the Irish Railway Clearing House. He stayed in this job until 1903.

During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and Æ. He also joined the Gaelic League and was a member of the first board of the Abbey Theatre. He became a regular user of the National Library of Ireland, where he met James Joyce and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; Colum&#x27;s own father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protesters. Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father&#x27;s fine afterwards.

He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly.

==Early poetry and plays==
He was awarded a prize by Cumann na nGaedheal for his anti-enlistment play, &quot;The Saxon Shillin&quot;&#x27;. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the Abbey Theatre, writing several of its early productions. His first play, &quot;Broken Soil&quot; (revised as The Fiddler&#x27;s House) (1903) was performed by W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company. &quot;The Land&quot; (1905), was one of that theatre&#x27;s first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named &quot;Thomas Muskerry&quot; (1910).

His earliest published poems appeared in &quot;The United Irishman&quot;, a paper edited by Arthur Griffith. His first book, &quot;Wild Earth&quot; (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in Arthur Griffith&#x27;s paper, &quot;The United Irishman&quot; this time, with &quot;The Poor Scholar&quot; bringing him to the attention of WB Yeats. He became a friend of Yeats and Lady Gregory. In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the Everyman&#x27;s Library edition of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot;.

He collected Irish folk songs, and adapted some of them. In a letter to the &quot;Irish Times&quot; in April 1970, he claimed to be the author of the words of &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; (the music being composed by Herbert Hughes), using only a single verse from an old County Donegal folk song. In the same correspondence, however, another music collector, Proinsias Ó Conluain, said he had recorded a &quot;very old&quot; song from Glenavy with words the same as the other three verses of &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;.

In 1911, with Mary Gunning Maguire, a student from UCD, and David Houston and Thomas MacDonagh, he founded the short-lived literary journal &quot;The Irish Review&quot;, which published work by Yeats, George Moore, Oliver St John Gogarty, and many other leading Revival figures.

In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at Pádraig Pearse&#x27;s experimental school, Scoil Éanna in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls&#x27; school, Scoil Íde (St. Ita&#x27;s), which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham. At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of Donnybrook, where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to Howth, a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most of the rest of their lives.

==Later life and work==
In America, Colum took up children&#x27;s writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with &quot;The King of Ireland&#x27;s Son&quot; (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from Gaelic because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, Hungarian Illustrator Willy Pogany suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story. Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the Newbery Honor. A contract for children&#x27;s literature with Macmillan Publishers made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are &quot;The Adventure of Odysseus&quot; (1918) and &quot;The Children of Odin&quot; (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.

He contributed to Emma Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.

In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. A first edition of the first volume (&quot;At the Gateways of the Day&quot;) was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011. Colum also started writing novels. These include &quot;Castle Conquer&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Flying Swans&quot; (1937). The spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and Nice, where Padraic renewed his friendship with James Joyce and became involved in the transcription of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at Columbia University and CCNY. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of Noh drama in his later plays.

While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. It was his only screenplay.

Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished &quot;Our Friend James Joyce&quot;, which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the Regina Medal. He died in Enfield, Connecticut, age 90, and was buried in St. Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery, Sutton.

In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the Binghamton University Libraries. He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; the last name was the same as the word &quot;column&quot;. &quot;In my first name, the first &quot;a&quot; has the sound of &quot;au&quot;. The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is &quot;pau&#x27;drig&quot;.&quot;

==History==

Rideo local bus service in Livermore began on August 7, 1978. In 1984, Dublin and Pleasanton began planning a local bus system, which Livermore was initially apprehensive about joining. In May 1985, the three cities plus Alameda County formed the Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority (LAVTA) as a joint powers authority. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission provided initial funding in September 1985. The new bus service, branded as &quot;Wheels&quot;, began operating in Dublin and Pleasanton on July 1, 1986. It initially had nine buses operating on hourly headways, which ran on weekdays and Saturdays but not Sundays. Rideo was merged into Wheels in July 1987.

A new maintenance facility was opened in September 1991, serving the 34 buses delivered the previous year. Paratransit service began in January 1996. Wheels began connecting to regional rail service with the introduction of BART service to Dublin/Pleasanton station in 1997 and ACR service to Livermore in 1998. Route 70X service between Dublin/Pleasanton and Walnut Creek began in January 1999. Until June 27, 2009, Wheels operated All-Nighter route 810 between Bay Fair station and Livermore.

In 2004, the BART I-580 Corridor Transit Study found that a BART extension to Livermore would not be feasible. Instead, the report recommended a rapid bus network serving the Tri-Valley. Construction on the &quot;Tri-Valley Rapid&quot; project took place from November 2009 to December 2010. Service on route R, which ran between West Dublin/Pleasanton station and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via Dublin, began on January 24, 2011. The weekday-only route operated every 10 minutes at peak and 15 minutes off-peak. It included some bus rapid transit elements like wider stop spacing, signal priority, and queue jumps. On August 13, 2016, local route 10 was converted to Rapid route 10R. It ran between Dublin/Pleasanton station and Livermore via Pleasanton. Route R was rerouted via Las Positas College and renamed route 30R at that time. By 2019, the two Rapid routes represented half of Wheels ridership.

<text>The Oxford University Press published a long series of poetry anthologies, dealing in particular with British poetry but not restricted to it, after the success of the &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot; (1900).
The Oxford poetry anthologies (&#x27;Oxford Books&#x27;) are traditionally seen as &#x27;establishment&#x27; in attitude, and routinely therefore are subjects of discussion and contention. They have been edited both by well-known poets and by distinguished academics. In the limited perspective of -formation, they have mostly been retrospective and well-researched, rather than breaking fresh ground.

They include:

* &quot;New Oxford Book of English Verse 1250-1950&quot; (1972) edited by Helen Gardner
* &quot;The New Oxford Book of English Light Verse&quot; (1978) compilation and introduction by Kingsley Amis

* &quot;Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse&quot; (1980) edited by D. J. Enright, reissued in 1995 as &quot;Oxford Book of Verse 1945-1980&quot;.
* &quot;Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry&quot; (2001) edited by Keith Tuma.
* &quot;Oxford Book of Greek Verse&quot; (1930) edited by Gilbert Murray.

<text>General Jehangir Karamat ( ; born 20 February 1941) is a retired four-star rank military officer, diplomat, public intellectual, and a former professor of political science at the National Defense University. Prior to serving as a Chief of Army Staff, he also served as the 9th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee from 1997 to 1998.

After joining the Pakistan Army in 1958, he entered in the Pakistan Military Academy at Kakul, and passed out in 1961 to later serve in the combat in conflicts with India in 1965 and in 1971. In 1995, he came into national prominence after he notably exposed the attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and eventually appointed as an army chief and later Chairman joint chiefs. His tenure is regarded as his pivotal role in enhancing the democracy and the civilian control when he staunchly backed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s authorisation of atomic-testing programme in 1998.

On 6 October 1998, Karamat was forcibly relieved from his four-star commands by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif over a disagreement on national security and reforms of the intelligence community. He is also one of very few army generals in the military history of Pakistan to have resigned over a disagreement with the civilian authorities.

After his resignation, he accepted the professorship at the Stanford University in California and appointed as to head Pakistan&#x27;s diplomatic mission as an Ambassador but was later removed due to strong advocacy for democracy.

Karamat has been credited for foresight prediction of the dangers of unbalanced civil-military relations and the rise of foreign-supported homegrown terrorism in the country. Many of his recommendations on national security eventually became part of counterterrorism policy by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Jehangir Karamat was born on 20 February 1941 in Karachi, Sindh in British Indian Empire, into a Pashtun-Kakazai family who initially hailed from Montgomery in Punjab (now Sahiwal, Punjab).

His father, Ahmad Karamat, was an officer in the Indian Civil Service with the Indian government who would later embarked his career as a bureaucrat in the Government of Pakistan after the partition of India in 1947.

After educating and graduating from the St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Karachi in 1958, Karamat joined the Pakistan Army when accepting at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. His mother moved with him in Kakul to overlook his education, and graduated with a class of 24th PMA Long Course, standing as a top-ranking cadet at Kakul when he conferred with the Sword of Honor in 1961.

In 1961, Karamat gained commissioned as 2nd-Lt in the 13th Lancers of the Corps of Armoured.

In 1969, Capt. Karamat was directed to attend the Command and Staff College in Quetta where he was noted for his intellect and competence at every level of courses he took as required in the curriculum. In 1971, Capt. Karamat graduated and qualified as the psc.

After the third war with India in 1971, Major Karamat was one of the last military officers who were sent to the United States to study at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.

Upon his graduation from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff College, Major Karamat was then directed to attend the National Defence University where he graduated and gained the MSc in the International Relations in 1976–77. In 1976, Karamat completed his MSc in International Relations from there; and following his return, Karamat completed his master&#x27;s programme at the National Defence University. In 1978–80, Major Karamat attained the MSc in War studies where his master&#x27;s thesis argued and enlightened on the failure of performance of armed forces in third war with India 1971.

== Military career ==

===During the Indo-Pakistani wars===

In 1963, Lt. Karamat was posted in his Armoured Corps to initially commanding a formation of main battle tanks. In 1965, Lt. Karamat commanded an infantry platoon during the second war with India in the Akhnur Sector in the Indian-administered Kashmir. Lt. Karamat&#x27;s platoon was the first unit that had penetrated into the enemy territory, which encouraged backup military companies to move forward into the enemy territory. In this war performance, the 13th Lancers had suffered death of fourteen soldiers, including three officers, while twenty eight were wounded. For this action, the 13th Lancers was awarded the battle honour, &quot;Dewa— Chumb and Jaurian of 1965&quot;, and was also awarded the title of &quot;The Spearhead Regiment&quot;. Although Pakistan lost the 1965 war to India, his regiment’s performance was exemplary. 

He progressed well in the army, eventually promoted to captain in 1966; and elevated as major in 1971. In 1971, Major Karamat commanded the company of the Aromoured Corps on the Western Front of the third war with India, defending the territories of Punjab, Pakistan against the approaching Indian Army.

During this time, Maj. Karamat was the commanding officer in the 15th Lancers attached to the Baloch Regiment, along with the 13th Lancers that was fighting in the Shakargarh area of Sialkot Sector, which is now known as Battle of Barapind. The regiment was awarded battle honour of &quot;Bara Pind 1971&quot;.

===Staff and war appointments===

In 1979–80, Lt-Col. Karamat was posted as an instructor at the Armed Forces War College (afwc) of the National Defence University (NDU), instructing on courses War studies. In 1981–83, Col. Karamat was moved at the Air War College, and did not take participation in the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan during his teaching assignments beforing promoting as one-star rank army general in the Pakistan Army.

In 1983–88, Brig. Karamat was appointed officer commanding of the Pakistan Armed Forces–Middle East Command, consisting of the joint armed branches in the Saudi Arabia. Initially stationed to cover the area of responsibility of Tabuk and Khamis Mushait in Saudi Arabia, Brig. Karamat Pakistan Armed Forces–Arab Contingent during the height of the Iran–Iraq War, protecting the territorial sovereignty of the Saudi Arabia. In 1988, Brig. Karamat returned from his combat duty, promoting to the two-star rank assignment at the Army GHQ. From 1988 to 1991, Major-General Karamat served as the DGl of the Directorate-General of the Military Operations (DGMO), where he was credited with playing a crucial role in advancing the fighting capabilities of the Pakistan Army while he planned numerous military exercises for Pakistan Army, and reviewed the contingency operations in Kargil sector.

In 1991, Maj-Gen. Karamat was appointed as Director-General of the Pakistan Army Rangers in Sindh but this appointment was short-lived when he was promoted to the three-star rank in 1992.

In 1992, Lieutenant-General Karamat was appointed as field command of the II Strike Corps, stationed in Multan, which he commanded until 1994. In 1994, Lt-Gen. Karamat was eventually elevated as the Chief of General Staff (CGS) at the Army GHQ under then-chief of army staff General Abdul Waheed Kakar. From 1993 to 1996, Karamat continued to serve as honorary Colonel Commandant, and then Colonel-in-Chief—both ceremonial posts—of the Armoured Corps from 1996 to 1998.

In 1995, Lt-Gen. Karamat rose to public prominence when he had the Military Intelligence (MI) to infiltrate within the Pakistan Army to apprehend the rogue culprits for attempting a coup d&#x27;état. Acting under orders from the General Karamat, DG MI Major-General Ali Kuli Khan monitored the activities of Major-General Zaheerul Islam Abbasi who himself was posted at the Army GHQ. The MI tapped the conversations and tracked down the culprits behind the coup. Upon revelation, Lieutenant-General Karamat forwarded the case and facilitated the high-ranking joint JAG court hearings at the specified military courts, and convened many proceedings while the hearings were heard by the military judges led by a Vice-Admiral. His actions were widely perceived in the country, and for his efforts, General Karamat was conferred with national honours in public conventions and state gatherings.

=== Chief of Army Staff ===
After approving the retirement papers of General Kakar, Lieutenant-General Karamat was appointed the Chief of Army Staff by Prime Minister Benazir who approved the paperwork for this appointment on 18 December 1995. As per Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s approval, President Farooq Leghari confirmed the promotion of Lieutenant-General Karamat to the four-star rank and was appointed as the Chief of Army Staff when General Kakar was due to retire on 12 January 1996.

At the time of his promotion, he was the senior most general at that time, and therefore at promotion to four-star general, he superseded no one. At the time of his promotion, there were four senior generals in the race to replace Kakar as Chief of Army Staff: Lieutenant-General Jehangir Karamat, chief of general staff (CGS); Lieutenant-General Nasir Akhtar, quartermaster general (QMG); Lieutenant-General Muhammad Tariq, inspector-general training and evaluation (IGT&amp;E) at the GHQ; and Lieutenant-General Javed Ashraf Qazi, commander XXX Corps stationed in Gujranwala. As Chief of Army Staff, General Karamat tried to work with the Prime minister and President at once, but soon came to understand that the misconducts of politicians and bureaucrats would eventually lead to the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s final government.

General Karamat reached to then-Speaker of the National Assembly Yousaf Raza Gillani and &quot;leaked&quot; an intelligence information and tried convincing Benazir Bhutto and President Leghari to resolve their issues, and emphasised to focus on good governance. At one point, General Karamat wrote:

=== Chairman of Joint Chiefs ===

In 1997, Chairman joint chiefs Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan was due retirement. On immediate basis, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appeared in news channels to confirmed General Karamat as the new Chairman joint chiefs. The appointment was met no resistance in the military, and General Karamat appointed as Chairman joint chiefs; he supersedes no one.

General Karamat drove Pakistan Armed Forces to focus on more professional duties rather than playing politics. Karamat worked on integrating Pakistan&#x27;s military on a common platform, and had his staff worked on inter-services coordination in the battlefield. Karamat strengthened the joint work coordination and joint logistics of the military at the war time situations, resolving many issues that would hamper the performances of the inter-services in the war or peacetime situations.

As an aftermath of India&#x27;s nuclear tests in 1998, General Karamat acted as principal military adviser to the government, aiding the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on military platform. At the telephonic meeting with the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, President Bill Clinton offered lucrative aid to Pakistan for not testing its devices; Prime Minister Sharif&#x27;s response was inconclusive. President Bill Clinton described the meeting with the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Strobe Talbott: &quot;You can almost hear the guy [Sharif] wringing his hands and sweating.&quot;

With requests made by Strobe Talbott CENTCOM commander, General Anthony Zinni and US Chairman Joint chiefs General Henry Shelton, met with General Karamat to withdraw the decision to conduct nuclear test. Zinni&#x27;e meeting with Karamat was described by Strobe Talbott as less contentious. General Karamat and General Zinni were able to draw &quot;soldier–to–soldier&quot; bond. General Karamat made it clear that the final decision would be carried out by the civilian government. At the NSC cabinet meeting, the Pakistani government, military, scientific, and civilian officials were participating in a debate, broadening, and complicating the decision-making process. Although, General Karamat debated towards presenting the national security and military point of view, the final decision was left on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s say.

After the decision was made, General Karamat was notified of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s decision and asked the military to be stand-by orders. After providing the joint military logistics, the nuclear tests were eventually carried out on 28 May 1998, as Chagai-I, and on 30 May 1998 as codename: Chagai-II. As dawn broke over the Chagai mountains, Pakistan became the world&#x27;s seventh nuclear power.

===Removal from Chairman joint chiefs===
As the nuclear tests were conducted, there was a strong feelings in the military all together that any concession to India on Kashmir policy and other related issues would lead to a decline in the prestige and standing of the armed forces. After the failure to pass the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution, there were concerns raised by Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s absolute control over the politics, national security, and foreign policy.

On 6 October 1998, General Karamat who lectured at the Naval War College in Karachi on the civic-military relations and presented the idea on reestablishing the official National Security Council (NSC) where military could have representation in the country&#x27;s politics. General Karamat openly spoke on the role of the internal intelligences, such as FIA and IB, carrying out vendettas-like operations against political opponents and insecurity-driven and expedient policies while Pakistan capsized, at the behest of the politicians. Prime Minister Sharif and his cabinet members perceived this idea as Chairman joint chiefs&#x27;s interference in national politics, therefore Sharif forced to resign Karamat when he criticised Pakistan&#x27;s political leadership and advocated a National Security Council that would give the military a constitutional role in running the country, similar to Turkey&#x27;s. In 1998, Prime Minister Sharif decided to relieve General Karamat from the chairmanship of joint chiefs, eventually having him tender his resignation at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat.

The relief of the famous and famed general by the popular politician led to a storm of public controversy. Many influential ministers and advisers in Prime Minister Sharif&#x27;s circle saw this decision as &quot;ill-considered&quot; and &quot;blunder&quot; made by the Prime Minister. At the military, Admiral Fasih Bokhari (Chief of Naval Staff at that time) criticized General Karamat for resigning but Karamat defended his actions as &quot;right thing&quot; to do as he lost the confidence of a constitutionally and popularly elected Prime Minister.

As General Karamat received a full guard of honour retirement in a colorful ceremony as Chairman joint chiefs and chief of army staff, Prime Minister Sharif&#x27;s mandate plummeted and his popularity waned as the majority of the public disapproved of the decision to relieve Karamat. Prime Minister Sharif&#x27;s further suffered with wide public disapproval after appointing much-junior General Pervez Musharraf at the both capacity, overruling the Admiral Bokhari&#x27;s turn as the Chairman joint chiefs. In 1999, Musharraf&#x27;s unilateral initiation of the Kargil war against India nearly pushed Pakistan and India to the brink of an all-out war between the two Nuclear states. Eventually, in the same year, Musharraf staged a successful coup d&#x27;état and overthrew Prime Minister Sharif.

Upon winning the general elections in 2013, Prime Minister Sharif did exactly what General Karamat had called for; first reestablishing the NSC with military gaining representation in the country&#x27;s politics; and further making more reforms in intelligence community.

==Academic career==

Before elevating to four-star assignments, General Karamat was the full tenured professor of the Political science at the National Defense University and held the chair of military science at the Armed Forces War College. Among his notable students included Pervez Musharraf, Ali Kuli Khan, Fasih Bokhari and Abdul Aziz Mirza who studied under his guidance. Karamat had significance influence on Bokhari and Musharraf&#x27;s philosophy and critical thinking.

In 2000, Karamat accepted the professorship of War studies at the CISAC Institute of the Stanford University in Stanford, California, United States. In addition, he was selected as a scholar and awarded research associateship on civil military relations at the Brookings Institution based in Washington, D.C., United States. In 2001, Karamat joined the United Nations (UN) and was a part of the area study on Afghanistan. Thereafter, Karamat joined the influential Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) as the chairman of the board of governors.

== Later career ==

=== Ambassador to the United States ===
In 2004, Karamat was first mentioned and named for the appointment as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States. His nomination came after the outgoing Pakistan Ambassador, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, termed was due expired. On 23 September 2004, Pakistan Ambassador Qazi was appointed by then-Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq. On 10 December 2004, Karamat presented his credentials to President George W. Bush.

On 23 March 2006, Pakistani news media reported that Ambassador Karamat was to be replaced by retired Major General Mahmud Ali Durrani. The reports further stated Ambassador Karamat, who took his post on a two-year contract, would be returning home after only a year and a half. These speculations were confirmed by the Foreign Office (FO) and noted that &quot;Karamat will not be in the reception line at the Chaklala Airbase to welcome President George Bush.

While his stint as Pakistan Ambassador, Karamat made the pro-democracy statements at the different Pakistani American gatherings, while passing critics to President Musharraf&#x27;s style of running the civilian government. In private, Karamat confided in Washington based U.S. journalist that &quot;General Musharraf had made up this story to create wedge between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and him to get him fired in 1998.&quot;

=== Founding the &quot;Spearhead Research&quot; think tank ===
After his ambassadorship, General Karamat founded a socio-political policy and analysis institute, &quot;Spearhead Research&quot;, which focuses on social, economic, military and political issues concerning Pakistan and Afghanistan. General Karamat is the director and contributor to the &quot;Spearhead Research Institute&quot;.

<text>Louise Doughty is an English novelist and screenwriter. She is best known for her bestselling novels, including &quot;Apple Tree Yard&quot;. She has also worked as a cultural critic for newspapers and magazines. Her weekly column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was published as &quot;A Novel in a Year&quot; in 2007. Doughty was the presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;A Good Read&quot; in 1998 to 2001.

==Biography==
Doughty was born on 4 September 1963 in Melton Mowbray and grew up in Oakham, Rutland. She attended Oakham School and is an alumna of Leeds University and of the University of East Anglia. She has lectured and contributed on creative writing in several countries of the world.

She is the author of nine novels, five plays for radio and a TV mini-series. In 2013, her seventh novel entitled &quot;Apple Tree Yard&quot;, was published and became a number one bestseller, selling over half a million copies in the UK alone. It has also been translated in thirty territories worldwide. A four-part television adaptation of the same name was broadcast on BBC One in January 2017. The series, which starred Emily Watson in the lead role and adapted by Amanda Coe, received widespread critical acclaim and consolidated viewing figures of 7 million per episode, making it the most-viewed new BBC drama at that time since &quot;The Night Manager&quot;. 

Her most recent book, &quot;Platform Seven&quot; (2019), was adapted as a four-part drama, by Paula Milne, with Dancing Ledge Productions for ITV in 2023. Her third novel, &quot;Honey-Dew&quot;, is under option with Chapter One pictures and she is working on a series outline.

In her first original drama for television, Doughty wrote the three-part thriller &quot;Crossfire&quot;, about a gun attack on a holiday resort, made by Dancing Ledge Productions for BBC One. It stars Keeley Hawes and was broadcast on 20, 21 and 22 September 2022. She is also an executive producer on the series.

Doughty now lives in London.

==Awards and honours==
Doughty&#x27;s sixth novel, &quot;Whatever You Love&quot;, was short-listed for the Costa Book Award for fiction in 2010, and long-listed for the Orange Prize in 2011.

&quot;Apple Tree Yard&quot;, was selected as a Richard &amp; Judy Book Choice in the spring of 2014. Hilary Mantel commented on the novel, &quot;There can’t be a woman alive who hasn&#x27;t once realised, in a moment of panic, that she&#x27;s in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong man. Louise Doughty... leads her unnerved reader into dark territory. A compelling and bravely written book.&quot; Her novel &quot;Black Water&quot;, (2016) was nominated as one of the New York Times Notable Books of the Year. 

Her short story &quot;Fat White Cop with Ginger Eyebrows&quot; was long-listed for the 2015 Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award.

Doughty is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2019, she received an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.) from the University of East Anglia.

<doc id="987593" wikidata="Q313497" url="?curid=987593" title="Danis Tanović">
<text>Danis Tanović (born 20 February 1969) is a Bosnian film director and screenwriter. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for the Golden Bear and the Palme d&#x27;Or.

Tanović is known for having directed and written the script for the film &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (2001), which won him many awards, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has also written and directed the award-winning films &quot;An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker&quot; (2013) and &quot;Death in Sarajevo&quot; (2016).

Tanović is the only person born in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina to have won an Academy Award.

==Early life==
Tanović was born in Zenica, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia on 20 February 1969. He was raised in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, where he also received his primary and secondary education.

Tanović attended the University of Sarajevo Music Conservatory, where he played the piano. As a young adult, he decided to study at the Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
Due to the siege of Sarajevo and the Bosnian War, following Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, Tanović was forced to stop his studies in 1992. Immediately after war broke out, he formed a film crew that followed the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina going on dangerous missions. The material that he and the film crew produced has since been used in numerous films and news reports about the Siege of Sarajevo and the Bosnian War.

In late 1994, Tanović left the film crew he had worked with for over two years. A year later, he decided to resume his studies, this time in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. In 1997, he completed his studies in Brussels, graduating at the top of his class. During his studies, Tanović made several documentary films.

===International recognition===
Shortly after, Tanović began his first movie project, entitled &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. He wrote and directed the movie, which was completed in 2001 and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival that same year. &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; went on to win the Award for Best Screenplay (&quot;Prix du scénario&quot;) at Cannes, followed by numerous awards including the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001, the European Film Academy Award for Best Screenplay, the César for the Best First Feature Film, the André Cavens Award for Best Film in 2001, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2002. Tanović was a member of the jury at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

His second feature project was &quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot;, completed in 2005, from the screenplay by the late Krzysztof Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz. The film marked the second installment in the Polish duo&#x27;s projected trilogy &quot;Heaven&quot; (filmed by Tom Tykwer in 2002), &quot;Hell and Purgatory&quot;. Inspired by Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot; explores the lives of three sisters, &quot;each locked in her own unhappiness, nursing a secret flower of misery, the seed for which was planted by their late father with a terrible incident in their girlhood&quot; (from a review by Peter Bradshaw). The film received mixed reviews.

===Later projects===
Tanović&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Cirkus Columbia&quot; was selected as the Bosnian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. In June 2011, he was bestowed with an &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorate by the University of Sarajevo.
His 2013 film &quot;An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker&quot; premiered in competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival where it won two prizes: Silver Bear for Best Actor and the Jury Grand Prix. Tanović&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Death in Sarajevo&quot; won the Jury Grand Prix at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. It has also won the FIPRESCI Award for the best film in competition.

In March 2020, Tanović&#x27;s film &quot;The Postcard Killings&quot; was released, based on the 2010 crime novel &quot;The Postcard Killers&quot;. The film &quot;Not So Friendly Neighborhood Affair&quot; was released in August 2021, receiving positive reviews. His latest film, &quot;My Late Summer&quot;, premiered at the 30th Sarajevo Film Festival on 16 August 2024.

==Personal life==
Tanović holds joint Bosnian and Belgian citizenship and lives in Sarajevo with his wife Maelys de Rudder and five children. He lived in Paris until 2007.

===Political engagement===
Tanović announced in March 2008 that he would be founding a political party with his friend, director Dino Mustafić, called Our Party, which would start contesting elections with the municipal elections in October 2008. He stated his motivations as wanting to bring political change to the country; his announcement was received positively.

<doc id="987602" wikidata="Q5342218" url="?curid=987602" title="Edward Carrington">
<text>Edward Carrington (February 11, 1748 – October 28, 1810) was an American soldier and statesman from Virginia. During the American Revolutionary War he became a lieutenant colonel of artillery in the Continental Army. He distinguished himself as quartermaster general in General Nathanael Greene’s southern campaign. He commanded artillery at Monmouth and Yorktown. He was also present at Cowpens, Guilford Court House, and Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill. During the war he became a close friend of George Washington. Carrington served in the 3rd Continental Congress and was the first US Marshal appointed from his state. He was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

==Family==
Edward Carrington was born on February 11, 1748, on Boston Hill Plantation near the town of Cartersville in old Goochland County, Virginia, later split off into Cumberland County, Virginia. He was the eighth of the 11 children of George Carrington and Anne Mayo. His father George arrived in Virginia in 1727 from Barbados and married Anne around 1732 when he was 21 and she was 20. Edward&#x27;s oldest brother Paul Carrington became an eminent jurist.

Edward married Elizabeth Jaquelin Ambler Brent Carrington (1765–1842) and the couple had no children. He was Elizabeth&#x27;s second husband; her first husband William Brent died. She co-founded the Female Humane Association around 1805 to aid homeless girls and young women, it is now known as the Memorial Foundation for Children.

==Revolutionary War==
===1775–1777===
Carrington studied the law and opened a law practice. He also managed a plantation in southern Virginia. In 1775–76 he became a member of the Goochland County Revolutionary Committee. On December 1, 1775, the state of Virginia established an artillery company. On February 13, 1776, the state authorities appointed James Innes the captain and Charles Harrison, Samuel Denney, and Carrington as lieutenants. the Continental Congress accepted the artillery unit into the Continental Army on March 19 and requested a second company from Virginia to be formed. Innes soon transferred to the infantry.

In late 1776, George Washington ordered his artillery chief Henry Knox to begin organizing three artillery regiments to support the Continental Army. Harrison&#x27;s Continental Artillery Regiment was authorized on 26 November 1776 and assigned to the Southern Department. The regiment was to expand from the two existing companies to a total of ten companies. Harrison was appointed the regiment&#x27;s colonel while Carrington became lieutenant colonel and second in command. Each company consisted of four officers, one sergeant, four corporals, four bombardiers, eight gunners, and 48 matrosses. The regiment garrisoned Virginia during 1777.

===1778–1780===
On March 13, 1778, Harrison&#x27;s Regiment was transferred to the main army. Carrington performed with distinction in the Battle of Monmouth on June 28. Beginning in the early afternoon and continuing for two hours, 10–14 American field guns dueled with eight British cannons and two howitzers. Carrington&#x27;s guns were placed on the American left flank under William Alexander, Lord Stirling&#x27;s command. On August 10, 1779, Harrison&#x27;s Regiment was renamed the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment. In March 1780, Carrington served with Arthur St. Clair, and Alexander Hamilton as commissioners for a prisoner exchange.

On April 17, 1780, the 1st Artillery Regiment was assigned to the Southern Department. Carrington was sent south in command of three artillery companies with Johann de Kalb&#x27;s forces. Harrison unexpectedly joined De Kalb and assumed command of the gunners when the force reached North Carolina, leaving Carrington unemployed. On July 25, Horatio Gates superseded De Kalb in command and gave Carrington a new assignment. Gates ordered him to investigate the best points to cross the Roanoke River for supplying the American forces and finding the best retreat routes. The American army led by Gates was smashed in the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780.

Nathanael Greene assumed command of the American southern army on December 3. The new leader ordered Carrington to continue reconnoitering possible routes of withdrawal, an action that historian Mark M. Boatner III wrote would &quot;prove decisive&quot;. Greene split his army into three parts: 600 led by Daniel Morgan, 1,100 under Isaac Huger at Cheraw, South Carolina, and light troops commanded by &quot;Light Horse&quot; Harry Lee. Greene appointed Carrington the quartermaster general. At that time there was no money in the military chest, yet the army was kept supplied. Among his new duties was an examination of the Dan River which is the southern branch of the Roanoke. Lee later wrote a glowing account of Carrington&#x27;s successful execution of this duty.

===1781–1783===
Historian Boatner believed that, &quot;this advance planning enabled Carrington to propose a course of action that probably saved the Southern army&quot;. On January 17, 1781, in the Battle of Cowpens, an 1,100-man American force under Morgan wrecked an equal-sized British force led by Banastre Tarleton. The Americans inflicted losses of 100 killed, 229 wounded, and 600 captured on the British while reporting only 12 killed and 60 wounded. Carrington was present at the battle. Sending his column of prisoners to Virginia, Morgan quickly left the scene of his stunning triumph and raced to join Greene&#x27;s forces. Greene realized that Lord Charles Cornwallis would soon be after Morgan with the main British army. He decided to retreat toward Virginia in the hope that Cornwallis would follow. Greene ordered Carrington to assemble boats on the Dan River and instructed his separate columns under Morgan, Lee, and Huger to head north for a rendezvous.

On February 1, 1781, Tarleton&#x27;s cavalry crossed the Catawba River and dispersed the North Carolina militia in actions at Cowan&#x27;s Ford and Torrence&#x27;s Tavern. On February 2, Morgan found boats waiting for him at Trading Ford on the Yadkin River; that night his troops crossed. On February 7, Morgan, Huger, and Lee rendezvoused at Guilford Court House, North Carolina. At this time, both Greene and Cornwallis were roughly the same distance from Dix&#x27;s Ferry on the Dan River. Carrington recommended that the American army cross the Dan downstream at Irwin&#x27;s Ferry and farther at Boyd&#x27;s Ferry. The proposal was adopted and Carrington arranged to move the boats to the downstream crossings. A 700-man rearguard was organized to hold off Cornwallis. Since Morgan insisted on leaving the army on account of his health, Otho Williams assumed command of the rearguard.

On February 10, Greene&#x27;s army left Guilford Court House and marched toward the two crossings suggested by Carrington, to the northeast. For two days, Williams succeeded in blocking Cornwallis from finding out the true direction of Greene&#x27;s retreat. By the morning of February 13, Tarleton had determined Greene&#x27;s real line of retreat. Sending his vanguard on the same road to deceive the Americans, Cornwallis suddenly shifted his main body to a road farther east. Carrington&#x27;s boats were now all at Irwin&#x27;s and Boyd&#x27;s ferries, so he took command of the cavalry detachment watching the British vanguard. Carrington noted that the British vanguard had slowed down and this, combined with other intelligence, confirmed Cornwallis&#x27; change of direction. Both armies raced along with hardly a rest, the Americans trying to reach Boyd&#x27;s Ferry and hold back their foes while the British tried to overrun them. At noon on February 14, Williams received a welcome message from Greene that the American main body had crossed the Dan and was safely on the north bank. At 9 pm, the last American cavalry crossed the Dan at Boyd&#x27;s Ferry with Lee and Carrington in the last boat. Blocked by high water and lacking boats, Cornwallis pulled back to Hillsborough, North Carolina.

Carrington was present at the Battle of Guilford Court House a few weeks later. On April 19, Greene&#x27;s army approached the British force under Lord Francis Rawdon at Camden, South Carolina. Deciding that Rawdon&#x27;s defenses were too strong, Greene took up a position on Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill to the north of Camden. On 22 April, Greene shifted his position and sent his cannons north to a secure location. When Greene returned to Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill on 24 April, Rawdon received intelligence that the Americans were without artillery and low on food. On the morning of April 25, 1781, Carrington arrived in the American camp with the artillery and provisions. That day, Rawdon advanced and won the Battle of Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill, but during its early stages he was unpleasantly surprised when Harrison&#x27;s three 6-pound cannons suddenly opened fire.

In July 1781, Greene granted Carrington leave to try to fill the vacancy in the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment after Thomas Proctor resigned in April. Greene filled the quartermaster general position with a deputy in case Carrington returned. During the Siege of Yorktown, Carrington, Ebenezer Stevens, and John Lamb rotated responsibility as Henry Knox&#x27;s chief assistant. It is not clear if Carrington exercised direct command over Whitehead Coleman&#x27;s company of the 1st Artillery or the three companies of the 4th Artillery present at Yorktown. Since he never received promotion, Carrington resumed his post as quartermaster general under Greene in the summer of 1782 and served in that capacity until the end of the war.

==Later career==
Carrington served as treasurer at the first meeting of Virginia&#x27;s Society of the Cincinnati on October 9, 1783. During the war, Carrington became a friend and confidant of George Washington. Virginia sent Carrington as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1786 to 1788. (Boatner states that it was 1785–1787.) He often visited Washington at Mount Vernon during this period. He was also a candidate for Virginia&#x27;s 9th congressional district in 1788, losing to Theodorick Bland. After being elected president, Washington appointed Carrington as the first U.S. Marshal for Virginia, a position he held from 1789 until March 1791. He then served as Virginia&#x27;s supervisor of the revenue from 1791 to 1794, placing him in charge of collecting controversial whiskey taxes in the state. The new president often sought Carrington&#x27;s advice on political matters. During his second term, President Washington offered Carrington the posts of Attorney General and Secretary of War, which were declined.

In 1797, Washington wrote a letter to Carrington stating that he had just hosted the future Supreme Court Justice John Marshall. He noted that Marshall approved of an improved threshing machine by a Mr. Booker. Washington wrote that he was sending a letter to Booker and asked that Carrington forward it to that individual. In 1798, President John Adams selected Carrington to be the quartermaster general for the United States Army during the Quasi-War with France, but the position was never filled and was eliminated when normal relations were restored. In 1807, Carrington was foreman of the jury during Aaron Burr&#x27;s treason trial. His brother-in-law John Marshall was the presiding judge and Burr was acquitted.

Carrington died on October 28, 1810, at Richmond, Virginia. 
In 1775, while listening to Patrick Henry&#x27;s famous &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech while standing outside a window at St. John&#x27;s Church where the speech was given, he turned to his friends and whispered, &quot;Boys, bury me here, in this very spot!&quot; Per his wishes, he is buried just outside that window.

<text>Tobin&#x27;s q (or the q ratio, and Kaldor&#x27;s v), is the ratio between a physical asset&#x27;s market value and its replacement value. It was first introduced by Nicholas Kaldor in 1966 in his paper: &quot;Marginal Productivity and the Macro-Economic Theories of Distribution: Comment on Samuelson and Modigliani&quot;. It was popularised a decade later by James Tobin, who in 1970, described its two quantities as:

==Measurement==

===Single company===
Although it is not the direct equivalent of Tobin&#x27;s q, it has become common practice in the finance literature to calculate the ratio by comparing the market value of a company&#x27;s equity and liabilities with its corresponding book values, as the replacement values of a company&#x27;s assets is hard to estimate:

:Tobin&#x27;s q = formula_1

It is also common practice to assume equivalence of the liabilities market and book value, yielding:
:Tobin&#x27;s q = formula_2.

Even if market and book value of liabilities are assumed to be equal, this is not equal to the &quot;Market to Book Ratio&quot; or &quot;Price to Book Ratio&quot;, used in financial analysis. The latter ratio is only calculated for equity values: Market to Book Ratio= formula_3.
Financial analysis also often uses the inverse of this ratio, the &quot;Book to Market Ratio&quot;, i.e. Book to Market Ratio= formula_4

For stock-listed companies, the market value of equity or market capitalization is often quoted in financial databases. It can be calculated for a specific point in time by formula_5.

===Aggregate corporations===
Another use for q is to determine the valuation of the whole market in ratio to the aggregate corporate assets. The formula for this is: formula_6

The following graph is an example of Tobin&#x27;s q for all U.S. corporations. The line shows the ratio of the US stock market value to US net assets at replacement cost since 1900.

==Effect on capital investment==
If the market value reflected solely the recorded assets of a company, Tobin&#x27;s q would be 1.0.

If Tobin&#x27;s q is greater than 1.0, then the market value is greater than the value of the company&#x27;s recorded assets. This suggests that the market value reflects some unmeasured or unrecorded assets of the company. High Tobin&#x27;s q values encourage companies to invest more in capital because they are &quot;worth&quot; more than the price they paid for them.

If a company&#x27;s stock price (which is a measure of the company&#x27;s capital market value) is $2 and the price of the capital in the current market is $1, so that q &gt; 1, the company can issue shares and with the proceeds invest in capital, thus obtaining economic profit.

On the other hand, if Tobin&#x27;s q is less than 1, the market value is less than the recorded value of the assets of the company. This suggests that the market may be undervaluing the company, or that the company could increase profit by getting rid of some capital stock, either by selling it or by declining to replace it as it wears out.

John Mihaljevic points out that &quot;no straightforward balancing mechanism exists in the case of low Q ratios, i.e., when the market is valuing an asset below its replacement cost (Q&lt;1). When Q is less than parity, the market seems to be saying that the deployed real assets will not earn a sufficient rate of return and that, therefore, the owners of such assets must accept a discount to the replacement value if they desire to sell their assets in the market. If the real assets can be sold off at replacement cost, for example via an asset liquidation, such an action would be beneficial to shareholders because it would drive the Q ratio back up toward parity (Q-&gt;1). In the case of the stock market as a whole, rather than a single firm, the conclusion that assets should be liquidated does not typically apply. A low Q ratio for the entire market does not mean that blanket redeployment of resources across the economy will create value. Instead, when market-wide Q is less than parity, investors are probably being overly pessimistic about future asset returns.&quot;

Lang and Stulz found out that diversified companies have a lower q-ratio than focused firms because the market penalizes the value of the firm assets.

Tobin&#x27;s insights show that movements in stock prices will be reflected in changes in consumption and investment, although empirical evidence shows that the relationship is not as tight as one would have thought. This is largely because firms do not blindly base fixed investment decisions on movements in the stock price; rather they examine future interest rates and the present value of expected profits.

==Other influences on q==
Tobin&#x27;s q measures two variables - the current price of capital assets as measured by accountants or statisticians and the market value of equity and bonds - but there are other elements that may affect the value of q, namely:

* Market hype and speculation, reflecting, for example, analysts&#x27; views of the prospects for companies, or speculation such as bid rumors.
* The &quot;intellectual capital&quot; of corporations, that is, the unmeasured contribution of knowledge, goodwill, technology and other intangible assets that a company may have but aren&#x27;t recorded by accountants. Some companies seek to develop ways to measure intangible assets such as intellectual capital. See balanced scorecard.

Tobin&#x27;s q is said to be influenced by market hype and intangible assets so that we see swings in q around the value of 1.

==Kaldor&#x27;s v and Tobin&#x27;s q==

In his 1966 paper &quot;Marginal Productivity and the Macro-Economic Theory of Distribution: Comment on Samuelson and Modigliani&quot; co-authored with Luigi Pasinetti, Nicholas Kaldor introduced this relationship as part of his broader theory of distribution that was non-marginalist. This theory is today known as the ‘Cambridge Growth Model’ after the location (University of Cambridge, UK) where the theories was devised. In the paper Kaldor writes:

 The &quot;valuation ratio&quot; (v) [is] the relation of the market value of shares to the capital employed by corporations.&quot;

Kaldor then goes on to explore the properties of v at a properly macroeconomic level. He ends up deriving the following equation:

where &quot;c&quot; is net consumption out of capital, &quot;sw&quot; is the savings of workers, &quot;g&quot; is the growth rate, &quot;Y&quot; is income, &quot;K&quot; is capital, &quot;sc&quot; is savings out of capital and &quot;i&quot; is the fraction of new securities issued by firms. Kaldor then supplements this with a price, &quot;p&quot;, equation for securities which is as follows:

He then goes on to lay out his interpretation of these equations:

 The interpretation of these equations is as follows. Given the savings-coefficients and the capital-gains-coefficient, there will be a certain valuation ratio which will secure just enough savings by the personal sector to take up the new securities issued by corporations. Hence the &quot;net&quot; savings of the personal sector (available for investment by the business sector) will depend, not only on the savings propensities of individuals, but on the policies of corporations towards new issues. In the absence of new issues the level of security prices will be established at the point at which the purchases of securities by the savers will be balanced by the sale of securities of the dis-savers, making the net savings of the personal sector zero. The issue of new securities by corporations will depress security prices (i.e. the valuation ratio &quot;v&quot;) just enough to reduce the sale of securities by the dis-savers sufficiently to induce the net savings required to take up the new issues. If &quot;i&quot; were negative and the corporations were net &quot;purchasers&quot; of securities from the personal sector (which they could be through the redemption of past securities, or purchasing shares from the personal sector for the acquisition of subsidiaries) the valuation ratio &quot;v&quot; would be driven up to the point at which net personal savings would be negative to the extent necessary to match the sale of securities by the personal sector. 

Kaldor is clearly laying out equilibrium condition by which, &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, the stock of savings in existence at any given time is matched to the total numbers of securities outstanding in the market. He goes on to state:

 In a state of Golden Age equilibrium (given a constant &quot;g&quot; and a constant &quot;K/Y&quot;, however determined), &quot;v&quot; will be constant, with a value that can be &gt;&lt;1, depending on the values of &quot;sc&quot;, &quot;sw&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;i&quot;. 

In this sentence Kaldor is laying out the determination of the &quot;v&quot; ratio in equilibrium (a constant &quot;g&quot; and a constant &quot;K/Y&quot;) by: the savings out of capital, the savings of workers, net consumption out of capital and the issuance of new shares by firms.

Kaldor goes further still. Prior to this he had asserted that &quot;the share of investment in total income is higher than the share of savings in wages, or in total personal income&quot; is a &quot;matter of fact&quot; (i.e. a matter of empirical investigation that Kaldor thought would likely hold true). This is the so-called &quot;Pasinetti inequality&quot; and if we allow for it we can say something more concrete about the determination of &quot;v&quot;:

 [One] can assert that, given the Pasinetti inequality, &quot;gK&gt;sw.Y&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&lt;1 when &quot;c&quot;=(1-&quot;sw&quot;). &quot;i&quot;=0; with &quot;i&quot;&gt;0 this will be true &quot;a fortiori&quot;. 

This fits nicely with the fact that Kaldor&#x27;s &quot;v&quot; and Tobin&#x27;s &quot;q&quot; tend on average to be below 1 thus suggesting that Pasinetti&#x27;s inequality likely does hold in empirical reality.

Finally, Kaldor considers whether this exercise give us any clue to the future development of income distribution in the capitalist system. The neoclassicals tended to argue that capitalism would eventually liquidate the capitalists and lead to more homogenous income distribution. Kaldor lays out a case whereby this might take place in his framework:

 Has this &quot;neo-Pasinetti theorem&quot; any very-long-run &quot;Pasinetti&quot; or &quot;anti-Pasinetti&quot; solution? So far we have not taken any account of the change in distribution of assets between &quot;workers&quot; (i.e. pension funds) and &quot;capitalists&quot; - indeed we assumed it to be constant. However since the capitalists are &quot;selling&quot; shares (if &quot;c&quot;&gt;0) and the pension funds are buying them, one could suppose that the &quot;share&quot; of total assets in the hands of the capitalists would diminish continually, whereas the share of assets in the hands of the workers&#x27; funds would increase continuously until, at some distant day, the capitalists have no shares left; the pension funds and insurance companies would own them all!. 

While this is a possible interpretation of the analysis Kaldor warns against it and lays out an alternative interpretation of the results:

 But this view ignores that the ranks of the capitalist class are constantly renewed by the sons and daughters of the new Captains of Industry, replacing the grandsons and granddaughters of the older Captains who gradually dissipate their inheritance through living beyond their dividend income. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the shares of the newly formed and growing companies grows at a higher rate than the average, whilst those of older companies (which decline in relative importance) grow at a lower rate. This means that the rate of capital appreciation of the shares in the hands of the capitalist group as a whole, for the reasons given above, is greater than the rate of appreciation of the assets in the hands of pension funds, etc. Given the difference in the rates of appreciation of the two funds of securities-and this depends on the rate at which new corporations emerge and replace older ones-I think it can be shown that there will be, for any given constellation of the value of the parameters, a long run equilibrium distribution of the assets between capitalists and pension funds which will remain constant. 

Kaldor&#x27;s theory of &quot;v&quot; is comprehensive and provides an equilibrium determination of the variable based on macroeconomic theory that was missing in most other discussions. But today it is largely neglected and the focus is placed on Tobin&#x27;s later contribution - hence the fact that the variable is known as Tobin&#x27;s &quot;q&quot; and not Kaldor&#x27;s &quot;v&quot;.

== Cassel&#x27;s q ==
In September 1996, at a lunch at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), attended by Tobin, Mark Cutis of the EBRD and Brian Reading and Gabriel Stein of Lombard Street Research Ltd, Tobin mentioned that &quot;in common with most American economists, [he] did not read anything in a foreign language] and that &quot;in common with most post-War economists [he] did not read anything published before World War II&quot;. He was therefore greatly embarrassed when he discovered that in the 1920s, the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel, had introduced a ratio between a physical asset&#x27;s market value and its replacement value, which he called &#x27;q&#x27;. Cassel&#x27;s q thus antedates both Kaldor&#x27;s and Tobin&#x27;s by a number of decades.

== Tobin&#x27;s marginal q ==
Tobin&#x27;s marginal q is the ratio of the market value of an additional unit of capital to its replacement cost.

==Price-to-book ratio (P/B)==
In inflationary times, q will be lower than the price-to-book ratio. During periods of very high inflation, the book value would understate the cost of replacing a firm&#x27;s assets, since the inflated prices of its assets would not be reflected on its balance sheet.

==Criticism==
Olivier Blanchard, Changyong Rhee and Lawrence Summers found with data of the US economy from the 1920s to the 1990s that &quot;fundamentals&quot; predict investment much better than Tobin&#x27;s q. What these authors call fundamentals is however the rate of profit, which connects these empirical findings with older ideas of authors such as Wesley Mitchell, or even Karl Marx, that profits are the basic engine of the market economy.

Doug Henwood, in his book &quot;Wall Street&quot;, argues that the q ratio fails to accurately predict investment, as Tobin claims. &quot;The data for Tobin and Brainard’s 1977 paper covers 1960 to 1974, a period for which &quot;q&quot; seemed to explain investment pretty well,&quot; he writes. &quot;But as the chart [see right] shows, things started going away even before the paper was published. While &quot;q&quot; and investment seemed to move together for the first half of the chart, they part ways almost at the middle; &quot;q&quot; collapsed during the bearish stock markets of the 1970s, yet investment rose.&quot; (p. 145)

<text>Ramanagara is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is also the headquarters of the New Bengaluru District. It is approximately 50 kilometres from Bangalore. There are buses and trains as public transportations which approximately takes 90 minutes from Bangalore. 

Famous Bollywood movie &quot;Sholay&quot; was shot in 1975 at the surrounding hills of Ramanagara now called Ramagiri hills but also has nickname of Sholay hills. Also the 2022 Malayalam film Jana Gana Mana was also shot here. 

The town was known as Shamsherabad or Ramserpuram at the ruling time of the Mysorean emperor, Tipu Sultan. It was called Closepet, after Sir Barry Close (1756–1813) in pre-independence times. This name is retained in geology. Then Rahim Nagar or Shamserabad was called Ramanagara. Ramanagara&#x27;s name was based on the historical story of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

== Demographics ==
 India census, Ramanagara had a population of 95,167. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Ramanagara has an average literacy rate of 63%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 67%, and female literacy is 58%. In Ramanagara, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Figures for the district, which was carved out of Bangalore Rural in September 2007, are not available as yet. Now it is changed to Ramanagara district.

== Economy ==

Ramanagara is well known for its sericulture, and is nicknamed Silk Town and Silk City. The silk produced in this region forms the input for the famous Mysore Silk. Ramanagara is the largest market for silk cocoons in Asia. 50 tonnes of cocoon a day arrive at the town. Ramanagara has extensive granite sites.

== Closepet granites ==
The Closepet granites are a major geological feature of this region and are from the Lower Proterozoic era. This belt of rocks extends in the north-south direction in 50 km belt. This belt has younger potassic granites and is believed to separate two distinct crustal blocks of Archaean age. The block to the west has low-grade granite-greenstone belts with iron-manganese ores and to the east are younger gneisses of granitic and granodioritic composition with gold-bearing schist belts.

<text>Fulgencio Obelmejías (born January 1, 1953), sometimes known also as Fully Obel is a Venezuelan former boxer, who was world super-middleweight champion.

==Biography==
Obelmejias was born in San José de Río Chico. He represented his native country at the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico City, where he lost his first fight to Ricardo Arce of Argentina. He also competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, where he was eliminated in the first round by Cuba&#x27;s eventual bronze medalist Luis Felipe Martínez. 

==Professional career==

He began his professional career, in the Middleweight division, on January 30, 1977, knocking out Franklin Suzarra in the first round at Caracas. After another win over Suzarra, he embarked on a tour of Mexico and southern California, having six consecutive fights in those areas from October 1977 to April 1978. In his first fight abroad as a professional, held at Mexico City, he worked for nine rounds in only his third professional bout before knocking out Jesus Garcia Ortiz. His second to last fight of that tour was against Abel Cordoba, whom he beat by a ten-round decision in Tuxtla Gutierrez on February 27. His last fight on that tour, against Rudy Robles in Tijuana on April 3, marked the beginning of a seventeen fight knockout win streak. He knocked out Robles in four rounds.

After the fight with Robles, Obelmejias had six consecutive fights in his native Venezuela, including a win over Johnny Heard. He then returned to Mexico, to fight for the Fecarbox Middleweight title against Carlos Marks on December 17 in Culiacán. He won the regional title, as well as a top ten ranking at the Middleweight division by the WBC, by knocking Marks out in nine rounds.

Obelmejias kept winning fights by knockouts, and, on March 3 of 1980, he got one of the biggest wins of his career, when he beat former WBC world Jr. Middleweight champion Elisha Obed in three rounds at Caracas.

After eight more wins, all by knockout, Obelmejias was made the number one contender for the world Middleweight title by the WBC.

When his first chance to become a world champion arrived, on January 17 of 1981, many Venezuelans had faith that he would become world champion; his record at the time (30-0 with 28 knockouts) impressed many boxing fans. However, Obelmejias lost for the first time, being handed an eighth-round knockout loss by then world champion Marvin Hagler in an HBO Boxing televised fight that took place at the famed Boston Garden, home of the NBA basketball&#x27;s Boston Celtics.

Obelmejias won eight fights in a row, all by knockout, before being given a rematch by Hagler. Among those beaten during that new streak were former world Jr. Middleweight champion Eddie Gazo, beaten in two rounds in Caracas, future world champion Chong-Pal Park, knocked out in eight rounds, also in Caracas, and Alfredo Escalera&#x27;s cousin, Reyes Escalera, also beaten in two rounds, in Barquisimeto.

On October 30 of 1982, he and Hagler had a rematch which was, once again, shown in the United States by HBO. The second time around, Hagler defeated Obelmejias by a knockout in five rounds at Sanremo, Italy. Both Hagler and Obelmejias fell in love with Italy and the country&#x27;s culture. Obelmejias established himself there immediately after the rematch with Hagler. Hagler moved to Italy as soon as he lost the world Middleweight title to Sugar Ray Leonard in 1987.

After his rematch with Hagler, Obelmejias won nine straight bouts before being upset, on July 27 of 1985, by Clarence Osby. Amongst the quality fighters that he defeated during that nine fight winning streak were Jeff Lampkin, beaten by an eight-round decision, Jerry Celestine, also beaten over eight rounds, and Eric Winbush, who was beaten in Monte Carlo by another eight-round decision.

Then, on May 30 of 1986, he became the Caribbean Light-Heavyweight champion, when he outpointed Tomas Polo Ruiz over ten rounds at Isla Margarita.

He lost the title in his first defense, when he was knocked out by future world champion Leslie Stewart in four rounds, at Trinidad and Tobago on November 15 of 1986.

After one more win, he was given a third try at becoming a world champion, when the Lineal and WBA Super Middleweight champion, Obelmejias&#x27; former rival, Chong-Pal Park, offered him a shot.

The third time proved to be the charm for Obelmejias, when he beat Park by a twelve-round decision on May 23, 1988 at South Korea. With that win, Obelmejias had fulfilled his lifelong dream; as well as the dream of his fans&#x27; of becoming a world champion.

His stint as world champion did not last long, however, and he lost the title during his first defense, 370 days after winning it, being knocked out in eleven rounds by In-Chul Baek, also in South Korea.

== Retirement ==
Obelmejias retired for good after three more wins; he was approaching, at 38, the mandatory boxing retirement age of 40 in Venezuela after his last fight, a ten-round decision win over Eduardo Rodriguez.

Obelmejias had a record of 52 wins and five losses, with 41 wins by way of knockout.

<doc id="987608" wikidata="Q3123623" url="?curid=987608" title="West Antarctic Ice Sheet">
<text>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is the segment of the continental ice sheet that covers West Antarctica, the portion of Antarctica on the side of the Transantarctic Mountains that lies in the Western Hemisphere. It is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies well below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.

As a smaller part of Antarctica, WAIS is also more strongly affected by climate change. There has been warming over the ice sheet since the 1950s, and a substantial retreat of its coastal glaciers since at least the 1990s. Estimates suggest it added around to the global sea level rise between 1992 and 2017, and has been losing ice in the 2010s at a rate equivalent to of annual sea level rise. While some of its losses are offset by the growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet, Antarctica as a whole will most likely lose enough ice by 2100 to add to sea levels. Further, marine ice sheet instability may increase this amount by tens of centimeters, particularly under high warming. Fresh meltwater from WAIS also contributes to ocean stratification and dilutes the formation of salty Antarctic bottom water, which destabilizes Southern Ocean overturning circulation. 

In the long term, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely to disappear due to the warming which has already occurred. Paleoclimate evidence suggests that this has already happened during the Eemian period, when the global temperatures were similar to the early 21st century. It is believed that the loss of the ice sheet would take place between 2,000 and 13,000 years in the future, although several centuries of high emissions may shorten this to 500 years. of sea level rise would occur if the ice sheet collapses but leaves ice caps on the mountains behind. Total sea level rise from West Antarctica increases to if they melt as well, but this would require a higher level of warming. Isostatic rebound of ice-free land may also add around to the global sea levels over another 1,000 years. 

The preservation of WAIS may require a persistent reduction of global temperatures to below the preindustrial level, or to below the temperature of 2020. Because the collapse of the ice sheet would be preceded by the loss of Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier, some have instead proposed interventions to preserve them. In theory, adding thousands of gigatonnes of artificially created snow could stabilize them, but it would be extraordinarily difficult and may not account for the ongoing acceleration of ocean warming in the area. Others suggest that building obstacles to warm water flows beneath glaciers would be able to delay the disappearance of the ice sheet by many centuries, but it would still require one of the largest civil engineering interventions in history.

==Description==
The total volume of the entire Antarctic ice sheet is estimated at 26.92 million km3 (6.46 million cu mi), while the WAIS contains about 2.1 million km3 (530,000 cu mi) in ice that is above the sea level, and ~1 million km3 (240,000 cu mi) in ice that is below it. The weight of the ice has caused the underlying rock to sink by between in a process known as isostatic depression.

Under the force of its own weight, the ice sheet deforms and flows slowly over rough bedrock. Ice ridges are the areas where ice sheet movement is slow because it is frozen to the bed, while ice streams flow much faster because there is liquid water in the sediments beneath them. Those are either the marine sediments which used to cover the ocean floor before the ice sheet froze above them, or they have been created due to erosion from the constant friction of ice against the bedrock. The water in these sediments stays liquid because the Earth&#x27;s crust below the ice streams is thin and conducts heat from geothermal activity, and because the friction also generates heat, particularly at the margins between ice streams and ice ridges.

When ice reaches the coast, it either calves or continues to flow outward onto the water. The result is a large, floating ice shelf affixed to the continent. These ice shelves restrain the flow of ice into the ocean for as long as they are present.

=== West Antarctic Rift System ===

The West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) is one of the major active continental rifts on Earth. It is believed to have a major influence on ice flows in West Antarctica. In western Marie Byrd Land, active glaciers flow through fault-bounded valleys (grabens) of the WARS. Sub-ice volcanism has been detected and is known to influence ice flows. In 2017, geologists from Edinburgh University discovered 91 volcanoes located two kilometres below the icy surface, making it the largest volcanic region on Earth.

Fast-moving ice streams in the Siple Coast adjacent to the east edge of the Ross Ice Shelf are influenced by the lubrication provided by water-saturated till within fault-bounded grabens within the rift, which would act to accelerate ice-sheet disintegration at more intense levels of climate change.
==History==
Like the other ice sheets, West Antarctic Ice Sheet had undergone significant changes in size during its history. Until around 400,000 years ago, the state of WAIS was largely governed by the effects of solar variation on heat content of the Southern Ocean, and it waxed and waned in accordance with a 41,000-year-long cycle. Around 80,000 years ago, its size was comparable to now, but then it grew substantially larger, until its extent reached the margins of Antarctica&#x27;s continental shelves during the Last Glacial Maximum ~30,000 years ago. It then shrunk to around its preindustrial state some 3,000 years ago. It also at times shrunk to a point where only minor and isolated ice caps remained, such as during the Marine isotope stage 31 ~1.07 million years ago, or the Eemian period ~130,000 years ago.

==Climate change==

===Observations===

West Antarctica has experienced statistically significant warming in recent decades, although there is some uncertainty about its magnitude. In 2015, the warming of the WAIS between 1976 and 2012 was calculated as a range between per decade and per decade. In 2009, the warming of the region since 1957 was estimated as exceeding per decade. This warming is strongest in the Antarctic Peninsula. In 2012, research found that the West Antarctic ice sheet had warmed by since 1958 – around per decade, which was almost double the 2009 estimate. In 2022, Central WAIS warming between 1959 and 2000 was estimated at per decade, with this change conclusively attributed to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.

The continually increasing ocean heat content forces the melting and retreat of ice sheet&#x27;s coastal glaciers. Normally, glacier mass balance offsets coastal losses through gains from snowfall at the surface, but between 1996 and 2006, Antarctic ice mass loss had already increased by 75%. Between 2005 and 2010, WAIS melting was thought to have added to global sea levels every year. Around 2012, the total mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was estimated at . Subsequent satellite observations revealed that the West Antarctic ice loss increased from in 1992 to in 2017, resulting in of Antarctica sea level rise. By 2023, became the average annual rate of mass loss since 2002, equivalent to of annual sea level rise.

Coastal glaciers are typically buttressed by ice shelves, which are massive blocks of floating ice next to a glacier. Yet, the ice shelves melt relatively quickly, as they are constantly in contact with the warming ocean water. Glacier retreat accelerates substantially once they collapse and stop providing structural support to the glacier, and once warm water can flow to the glacier unimpeded. Most ice losses occur at the Amundsen Sea Embayment and its three most vulnerable glaciers – Thwaites Glacier, Pine Island Glacier and Smith Glacier. Around 2005, they were thought to lose 60% more mass than what they have gained, and to contribute about per year to global sea level rise. 

Of the three, Thwaites Glacier is the best-known, to the point of being nicknamed the &quot;Doomsday Glacier&quot; by some in the press, although many scientists consider it alarmist and inaccurate. The reason for concern about Thwaites is because it had been experiencing substantial mass loss since at least the early 1990s, while its local seabed topography provides no obstacles to rapid retreat, with its most vulnerable parts located below the sea level. Further, it had been shown in 2021 that the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which restrains the eastern portion of the Thwaites Glacier, could start to collapse within five years. The glacier would start to see major losses &quot;within decades&quot; after the ice shelf&#x27;s failure, and its annual contribution to sea level rise would increase from the current 4% to 5%, although it would still take centuries to disappear entirely.

=== Projected 21st century ice loss ===

As the West Antarctic Ice Sheet loses ice due to the warming ocean water melting its coastal glaciers, it inevitably contributes to sea level rise. However, projections are complicated by additional processes that are difficult to model, such as meltwater from the ice sheet itself changing local circulation due to being warmer and fresher than the ocean water. Another complicated process is hydrofracturing, where meltwater collecting atop the ice sheet may pool into fractures and force them open, further damaging its integrity. Climate change alters winds above Antarctica, which can also affect surface current circulation, but the importance of this process has been disputed.

Most importantly, the WAIS has a complex topography which magnifies its vulnerability. The grounding lines of its glaciers are below the sea level by several hundred metres or more, and the bed only deepens upstream. This means that as the ice sheet loses mass to melting, an increasing fraction of its height becomes exposed to warm water flows that are no longer displaced by its mass. This hypothesis is known as marine ice sheet instability (MISI) and it has the potential to greatly accelerate ice losses. The lack of knowledge about its specifics introduces substantial uncertainty into projections of 21st century sea level rise. WAIS could be even more vulnerable under the so-called marine ice &quot;cliff&quot; instability hypothesis (MICI). It suggests that when a glacier&#x27;s ice shelf melts, it would not just retreat faster, but rapidly collapse under its own weight if the height of its cliffs was greater than . This particular process has never been observed and was even ruled out by some of the more detailed modelling, but it still adds to the uncertainty in sea level projections.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has wrestled with the limited information about MISI for a long time. In 2001, IPCC Third Assessment Report mentioned the possibility of such disintegration and provided a vague long-term estimate for what it then described as a hypothetical. In 2007, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report omitted any mention of it due to increased uncertainty, and a number of scientists criticized that decision as excessively conservative. The 2013/2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was again unable to describe the risk, but it stated with &quot;medium confidence&quot; that MISI could add up to several tens of centimeters to 21st century sea level rise. The report projected that in the absence of instability, WAIS would cause around of sea level rise under the low-emission scenario RCP2.6. High emission scenario RCP8.5 would have slightly lower retreat of WAIS at , due to calculations that the surface would be gaining mass. This is possible because effects of climate change on the water cycle would add more snow to the surface of the ice sheet, which is soon compressed into more ice, and this could offset some of the losses from the coasts.

Afterwards, several major publications in the late 2010s (including the Fourth United States National Climate Assessment in 2017) suggested that if instability was triggered, then the overall sea level rise (combining the melting of West Antarctica with that of the Greenland ice sheet and mountain glaciers, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater) from the high-emission climate change scenario could double, potentially exceeding by 2100 in the worst case. A 2016 study led by Jim Hansen presented a hypothesis of vulnerable ice sheet collapse leading to near-term exponential sea level rise acceleration, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years, which would then lead to multi-meter sea level rise in 50, 100 or 200 years. However, it remains a minority view amongst the scientific community. For comparison, a 2020 survey of 106 experts found that their 5%–95% confidence interval of 2100 sea level rise for the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 was . Their high-level projections also included both ice sheet and ice cliff instability: the experts found ice cliff instability research to be just as, or even more influential, as the IPCC Fifth Assessment report.

Consequently, when the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) was published in 2021–2022, it estimated that while the &quot;median&quot; increase in sea level rise from the West Antarctic ice sheet melt by 2100 would be ~ under all emission scenarios (since the increased warming would intensify the water cycle and increase snowfall accumulation over the ice sheet at about the same rate as it would increase ice loss), it can conceivably contribute up to by 2100 under the low-emission scenario and up to under the highest-emission one, due to the aforementioned uncertainties. It had also been suggested that by the year 2300, Antarctica&#x27;s role in sea level rise would only slightly increase from 2100 if the low-emission RCP2.6 scenario was followed, only contributing a median of . On the other hand, even the minimum estimate of West Antarctica melting under the high-emission scenario would be no less than , while the median would amount to and the maximum to .

=== Impacts of melting on ocean currents ===

Ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (along with much smaller losses from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet adds meltwater to the Southern Ocean, at a total rate of 1100–1500 billion tons (GT) per year. This meltwater is fresh, and when it mixes with ocean water, the ocean becomes fresher (less salty) as well. This results in the increased stratification and stabilization of the ocean layers, which has a significant impact on Southern Ocean overturning circulation. It is one half of the global thermohaline circulation, with the better-known Atlantic meridional overturning circulation being the other. Southern Ocean absorbs by far the most heat and is also the strongest carbon sink of any ocean. Both properties are affected by the strength of the overturning circulation.

The overturning circulation consists of two parts – the smaller upper cell, which is most strongly affected by winds and precipitation, and the larger lower cell, which is defined by the temperature and salinity of Antarctic bottom water. Since the 1970s, the upper cell has strengthened by 50–60%, while the lower cell has weakened by 10–20%. Some of this was as the result of the natural cycle of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, but large flows of meltwater also had a clear effect, The circulation may lose half of its strength by 2050 under the worst climate change scenario, and decline even more afterwards. In the long run, the circulation could collapse entirely: potentially between and , though this is much less certain than with the other tipping points in the climate system. This collapse would likely require multiple centuries to unfold: it is not expected to diminish Southern Ocean heat and carbon uptake during the 21st century, but is likely to weaken its carbon sink once it is complete, which would be closer to 2300. Other likely impacts include a decline in precipitation in the Southern Hemisphere countries like Australia (with a corresponding increase in the Northern Hemisphere), and an eventual decline of fisheries in the Southern Ocean, which could lead to a potential collapse of certain marine ecosystems. Due to limited research to date, few specifics are currently known.

===Long-term thinning and collapse===

The same ice sheet topography which makes marine ice sheet instability possible in the short term, also leaves it vulnerable to disappearing in response to even seemingly limited changes in temperature. This suggestion had first been presented in a 1968 paper by glaciologist J. H. Mercer. In the 1970s, radar measurements from research flights revealed that glacier beds in Pine Island Bay slope downwards at an angle, well below the sea level. Thus, even a limited warming of ocean currents ice would effectively undermine the ice. In 1981, the Amundsen Sea region had first been described by the researchers as &quot;the weak underbelly&quot; of the WAIS, with the hypothesis that the collapse of Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier would trigger the collapse of the entire ice sheet. This had been supported by subsequent research.

Now, the potential for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to disappear after a certain temperature is exceeded is considered one of the tipping points in the climate system. Earlier research suggested it may withstand up to before it would melt irreversibly, but was eventually considered a more likely threshold. By 2023, multiple lines of evidence suggested that the real tipping point was around , which has already been reached in the early 21st century. This includes paleoclimate evidence from the Eemian period, such as analysis of silt isotopes in the Bellingshausen Sea, or the genomic history of Antarctica&#x27;s Turquet&#x27;s octopus. The former shows specific patterns in silt deposition and the latter genetic connections between currently separate subpopulations; both are impossible unless there was no ice outside of mountain caps in the West Antarctica around 125,000 years ago, during Marine Isotope Stage 5. Since that period was only to warmer than the preindustrial period, the current levels of warming are also likely to be sufficient to eventually melt the ice sheet. Further, oceanographic research explains how this irreversible melting would occur, by indicating that water temperatures in the entire Amundsen Sea are already committed to increase at triple the historical rate throughout the 21st century. 

However, while the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely to be committed to disappearance, it would take a long time. Its most vulnerable parts like Thwaites Glacier, which holds about of sea level rise equivalent, are believed to require &quot;centuries&quot; to collapse entirely. Thwaites&#x27; ice loss over the next 30 years would likely be around 5 mm of sea level rise between 2018 and 2050, and between 14 and 42 mm over 100 years. Other research also suggests that Thwaites Glacier would add less than 0.25 mm of global sea level rise per year over the 21st century, although it would increase to over 1 mm per year during its &quot;rapid collapse&quot; phase, which it expected to occur between 200 and 900 years in the future. 2023 research had also shown that much of the glacier may survive 500 years into the future.

Consequently, the entire WAIS would most likely take around 2,000 years to disintegrate entirely once it crosses its tipping point. Under the highest warming scenario RCP8.5, this may be shortened to around 500 years, while the longest potential timescale for its disappearance is around 13,000 years. In 1978, it was believed that the loss of the ice sheet would cause around of sea level rise, Later improvements in modelling had shown that the collapse of the ice grounded below the sea level would cause ~ of sea level rise, The additional melting of all the ice caps in West Antarctica that are not in contact with water would increase it to . However, those ice caps have been continuously present for at least the past 1.4 million years, and so their melting would require a larger level of warming.

==== Isostatic rebound ====
2021 research indicates that isostatic rebound, after the loss of the main portion of the ice sheet, would ultimately add another to global sea levels. While this effect would start to increase sea levels before 2100, it would take 1000 years for it to cause of sea level rise – at which point, West Antarctica would be higher than now. Because the ice sheet is so reflective, its loss would also have some effect on the ice-albedo feedback. A total loss would increase the global temperatures by , while the local temperatures would increase by around .

Estimates of isostatic rebound after the loss of East Antarctica&#x27;s subglacial basins suggest sea level rise contributions of between and .

===Reversing or slowing ice sheet loss===
While it would take a very long time from start to end for the ice sheet to disappear, some research indicates that the only way to stop its complete meltdown once triggered, is by lowering the global temperature to &quot;below&quot; the preindustrial level; i.e. below the temperature of 2020. Other researchers have proposed engineering interventions to stabilize Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers before they are lost. For instance, 2019 research estimated that moving some ocean water from the Amundsen Sea to the top of the Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier area and freezing it to create at least 7400 billion tonnes of snow would stabilize the ice sheet. This would be enormously expensive, as an equivalent of 12,000 wind turbines would be required to provide power just to move the water to the ice sheet, even before desalinating it (to avoid enhancing surface melt with salt) and turning it to snow. It also assumed local water temperature remaining at early 21st century levels, rather than tripling unavoidably by 2100 as was discovered by later research.

<text>Roger is a masculine given name, and a surname. The given name is derived from the Old French personal names &#x27; and&#x27;. These names are of Germanic origin, derived from the elements &#x27;, &quot;χrōþi&quot; (&quot;fame&quot;, &quot;renown&quot;, &quot;honour&quot;) and&#x27;, &#x27; (&quot;spear&quot;, &quot;lance&quot;) (Hrōþigēraz). The name was introduced into England by the [[Normans]]. In [[Normandy]], the [[Franks|Frankish]] name had been reinforced by the [[Old Norse]] cognate&#x27;. The name introduced into England replaced the Old English cognate &quot;&quot;. &quot;Roger&quot; became a very common given name during the Middle Ages. A variant form of the given name &quot;Roger&quot; that is closer to the name&#x27;s origin is &quot;Rodger&quot;.

== Slang and other uses==
From up to , Roger was slang for the word &quot;penis&quot;. In &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, Dylan Thomas writes &quot;jolly, rodgered&quot; suggesting both the sexual double entendre and the pirate term &quot;Jolly Roger&quot;.

In 19th-century England, Roger was slang for another term, the cloud of toxic green gas that swept through the chlorine bleach factories periodically.

From circa 1940 in US and UK wartime communication, &quot;Roger&quot; came to represent &quot;R&quot; when spelling out a word. &quot;R&quot; is the first letter in &quot;received&quot;, used to acknowledge understanding a message. This spread to civilian usage as &quot;Roger&quot; replaced &quot;received&quot; in spoken usage in air traffic radio parlance by 1950.

Current British slang includes the word as a verb to mean sexual intercourse, e.g., &quot;took her home and rogered her.&quot;

Hodge meaning Rustic, from Middle English Hoge a nickname of Roger.

<text>Live Theatre, formerly Live Theatre Company, is a new writing theatre and company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. As well as producing and presenting new plays many of which go on to tour nationally and internationally, it seeks out and nurtures creative talent and runs a large education programme for young people.

== History ==
Originally founded in Tyneside in 1973 by Val McLane, Geoff Gillham and Dave Clark, the company originally toured its work regionally to non-traditional theatre settings, such as community halls and working men&#x27;s clubs. The company was creating plays and stories that were relevant to the North East community and sought to break down barriers by presenting this work to ordinary working-class people within their own communities.

The company has been based in Newcastle Quayside since 1982, expanding over the years to occupy the current premises which combine converted warehouses and Almshouses to create a building which houses a theatre auditorium, café bar, rehearsal spaces and administrative offices. Live Theatre also took over the lease of a new warehouse building on Broad Chare, immediately adjacent to the previous theatre. In 2007 Live Theatre underwent a further capital development. It now has a cabaret style theatre, a studio theatre, renovated rehearsal rooms, a series of dedicated writer&#x27;s rooms as well as a café, bar and gastro pub, The Broad Chare, all in a restored and refurbished complex of five Grade II listed buildings.

== Productions ==
Live Theatre develops new writing talent in the region. The company has enjoyed significant relationships with many writers such as CP Taylor, Tom Hadaway, Alan Plater and, more recently, Peter Flannery, Michael Chaplin, Peter Straughan, Julia Darling, Lee Hall, Sean O&#x27;Brien and Karen Laws. Many plays have been commissioned and produced over the years which are now known nationally and internationally, such as &quot;Close The Coalhouse Door&quot;, &quot;Cooking with Elvis&quot;, &quot;Operation Elvis&quot; and &quot;And a Nightingale Sang&quot;.

In 2013 Live Theatre celebrated 40 years of creating plays on Tyneside with a programme that included a new national tour of Lee Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Pitmen Painters&quot; by Bill Kenwright Limited, and sell out runs at Live Theatre of &quot;Tyne&quot; by Michael Chaplin, &quot;Wet House&quot; by new talent Paddy Campbell and a revival of Lee Hall&#x27;s &quot;Cooking with Elvis&quot;. &quot;Wet House&quot; successfully transferred to the Soho Theatre in 2014.

Between January and June 2014 Live Theatre presented a series screenplays in development by writer Lee Hall, which includes scrips in development about English cricketer Harold Larwood, a film adaptation of Down and out in paris and london based on the book by George Orwell, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; about the life of pop star Elton John and &quot;Victoria and Abdul&quot; based on the life of Queen Victoria and her manservant and &quot;For The End of Time&quot; based on the life and works of French composer Messiaen. All were read as script-in-hand readings in Live Theatre&#x27;s main theatre.

&quot;Incognito&quot; by Nick Payne was a co-production between Live Theatre, nabokov, HighTide Festival Theatre and in association with The North Wall, Oxford in spring 2014, which previewed at Live Theatre in April 2014, before going to HighTide Festival and The North Wall. It returned to Live Theatre in May 2014 and then had a sell-out run at The Bush Theatre, London.

Live Theatre&#x27;s 2013 show &quot;Captain Amazing&quot; written by Bruntwood Prize winning author Alistair McDowall, directed by Clive Judd and starring Mark Weinman returned to Live Theatre in May 2014 and was performed at Northern Stage&#x27;s Kings Hall Edinburgh venue for a week as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

<doc id="987638" wikidata="Q4680630" url="?curid=987638" title="Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu">
<text>The Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu () is an homage to the Romanian heroes of the First World War. The ensemble comprises three sculptures: The Table of Silence (&quot;Masa tăcerii&quot;), The Gate of the Kiss (&quot;Poarta sărutului&quot;), and the Infinity Column (&quot;Coloana Infinitului&quot;) on an axis 1.3 km ( mile) long, oriented west to east. The ensemble is considered to be one of the great works of 20th-century outdoor sculpture. The ensemble was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2024.

==History==

The monument was commissioned by the &quot;National League of Gorj Women&quot; to honor those soldiers who had defended Târgu Jiu in 1916 from the forces of the Central Powers. Constantin Brâncuși (1876–1957) was at the time living in Paris, but welcomed the opportunity to create a large commemorative sculpture in his homeland. He accepted the commission in 1935, but refused to receive payment for it.

==&quot;The Endless Column&quot;==
&quot;The Endless Column&quot; symbolizes the concept of infinity and the infinite sacrifice of the Romanian soldiers. 
The &quot;Infinity Column&quot; stacks 15 rhomboidal modules, with a half-unit at the top and bottom, making a total of 16. The incomplete top unit is thought to be the element that expresses the concept of the infinite. Brâncuși had experimented with this form as early as 1918, with an oak version now found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The modules were made in the central workshop of Petroșani (&quot;Atelierele Centrale Petroșani&quot;), assembled by Brâncuși&#x27;s friend engineer Ștefan Georgescu-Gorjan (1905–1985), and completed on 27 October 1938. All 16 rhomboidal modules accumulate a total height of 29.3 m.

In the 1950s, the Romanian communist government planned to demolish the column and turn it into scrap metal, but this plan was never executed. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the fall of the Communist regime, there was renewed interest in restoring the column, which by that time suffered from tilting, cracking, metal corrosion, and an unstable foundation. For these reasons the site was listed in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. The restoration was facilitated by the Fund, which organized meetings for the stakeholders in 1998 and provided funding through American Express. Subsequently, the site was restored between 1998 and 2000 through a collaborative effort of the Romanian Government, the World Monuments Fund, the World Bank, and other Romanian and international groups.

==&quot;Ensemble&quot;==
Two other pieces constitute the &quot;Ensemble&quot;. 

&quot;The Table of Silence&quot; is a circular stone table surrounded by twelve hourglass-seats, which symbolize time. The significance of Brâncuși&#x27;s sculpture has been subjected to many interpretations. Some say that &quot;The Table of Silence&quot; represents the moment before the battle. Nevertheless, the seats are not located close to the edges of the table. Others say that it represents The Last Supper, in which the twelve apostles are seated around Jesus. The chairs are for the apostles and the table represents Jesus himself. 

&quot;The Gate of the Kiss&quot;, of Banpotoc travertine (marble), features two kiss motifs on the pillars. The entire gate has a width of 6.45 m and a height of 5.13 m.
The transition to another life occurs through &quot;The Gate of the Kiss&quot;.

The &quot;Ensemble&quot; was inaugurated on 27 October 1938. During the Socialist Realism epoch, Brâncuși was challenged as an exponent of &quot;cosmopolitan bourgeois formalism&quot;. However in 1964, Brâncuși was rediscovered in Romania as a national genius and consequently the &quot;Ensemble of Târgu Jiu&quot; was restored from a long period of degradation.

<doc id="987643" wikidata="Q6547505" url="?curid=987643" title="Lilac Bloomsday Run">
<text>The Lilac Bloomsday Run, also known as Bloomsday, is an annual timed road race in the northwest United States, held on the first Sunday of May since 1977 in The course length is 12 km (7.456 mi).

The run had over 38,000 participants every year since 1986 until 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Registration peaked in 1996 at 61,298 with 56,156 finishers. Lineth Chepkurui set an unofficial 12 km world record in the 2010 women&#x27;s race.

The course record of 33:51 was set in 2008 by Micah Kogo, a pace of 4:32.4 per mile and an average speed of . The women&#x27;s record of 38:03 was set in 2016 by Cynthia Limo, a 5:06.2 per mile pace and an average speed of .

Don Kardong, who founded the race, explained the name as &quot;a starting event for the Lilac Festival … you know, lilacs blooming. And of course, I like it because it rhymes with doomsday.&quot; The shortened name Bloomsday is usually associated instead with James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; and celebrations of June 16, the day in the life of Leopold Bloom that the novel chronicles.

Kardong had hoped for five hundred participants for the inaugural edition in 1977, and got nearly triple that. The second edition had over five thousand, and the third in 1979 was over ten thousand, with fifty thousand spectators lining the streets. The sixth edition in 1982 had over 22,000, and despite rain and some snow, there were over 30,000 in 1984.

The early editions were around in length. A new course was introduced 

==Course==
The course starts in Downtown Spokane and heads northwest along the far west end of town, passes by Mukogowa Ft. Wright Institute and Spokane Falls Community College before heading up &quot;Doomsday Hill&quot; and back downtown past the Spokane County Courthouse and ending at the Monroe Street Bridge. Every finisher of the race receives a Bloomsday T-shirt.

==Results==

<doc id="987658" wikidata="Q699396" url="?curid=987658" title="Erhard Busek">
<text>Erhard Busek (25 March 1941 – 13 March 2022) was an Austrian politician from the Christian-conservative People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP). Throughout his political career, he was widely regarded as one of the leaders of the party&#x27;s liberal wing. He was coordinator of the South-Eastern Cooperative Initiative (SECI) and chairman of the Institute for the Danube Region and Central Europe.

Busek was chief of the party and Vice-Chancellor of Austria in the coalition of the Social Democratic Party of Austria with the People&#x27;s Party between 1991 and 1995 and was an important reformer of the Austrian universities. From January 2002 until June 2008 Busek served as Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, the final person to hold the position.

==Early life and education==
Busek earned his Doctor of Laws at the University of Vienna in 1963. During his studies, he also served as Chairman of the Austrian Youth Council. He was a Roman Catholic. He was a Boy Scout in his youth.

==Political career==
Busek began his professional career in 1964 as legal adviser to the association of the parliamentarians of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP). He then served as Secretary General of the Austrian Federation for Trade and Commerce (1968–1975). In 1975, he was appointed Secretary-General of the Austrian People’s Party and was elected Member of Parliament later that year. Busek was succeeded as secretary-general by Sixtus Lanner in 1976. Busek gained additional experience in administration between 1968 and 1976 while with a publishing firm in the economic field. In 1976 Busek entered municipal politics. He was City Councilor and was elected Deputy-Mayor of Vienna in 1978, a position he held until 1987. He was appointed Minister for Science and Research in April 1989. From 1994 until May 1995 Busek was Minister for Education.

===Vice-Chancellor of Austria, 1991–1995===
Busek was elected Chairman of the Austrian People’s Party in 1991 and served as Vice-Chancellor of Austria in the government of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky from 1991 to 1995. In this position, he argued in favor of recognizing the independence of the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, a move that would have put Austria outside the Western consensus on the issue. The government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament in the 1994 elections that gave increased support to Jörg Haider, a right-wing leader known for his anti-immigrant speeches. However, both Vranitzky and Busek negotiated to continue their coalition and to lead Austria into the European Union in 1995.

At the April 1995 party congress, Wolfgang Schüssel took over the ÖVP chairmanship in a coup succeeding Busek and replacing the party’s ministers in the governing coalition. Following his departure from the Austrian government, Busek was tipped as rector of the College of Europe in Bruges, the training ground for EU officials and diplomats, and as being the preferred choice of then President of the European Commission Jacques Santer for the post; the job instead went to Otto von der Gablentz.

===Role in European politics, 2000–2009===
In early 2000 Busek was appointed Special Representative of the Austrian Government on EU Enlargement by Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel. He served in that position until December 2001. From January 2002 until June 2008, Busek was the Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, succeeding Bodo Hombach in this Brussels-based position. During his time in office, he pressed for EU membership for the Western Balkan countries before Turkey’s accession to the Union.

In 2009, Busek served as an adviser to the Czech EU presidency.

==Other activities==
Busek has delivered many lectures on domestic and foreign topics and has participated in many conferences in Austria and abroad. He received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Kraków, of Bratislava, of Brasov and Czernowitz, of Liberec and the Webster-St. Louis University Vienna. He was vice-chancellor of the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg, Visiting Professor at Duke University, NC, USA, and at the University of Agriculture in Vienna. He was also teaching at the University Innsbruck and the University of Vienna. In addition his lectures are planned to be involved in the teaching programme of the Vienna University of Technology (Technische Universität Wien) and the University of Belgrade, Serbia.

Since 2008, Busek has been advising the Economic Initiative for Kosovo on promoting foreign direct investments in Kosovo.

In addition, Busek has held paid and unpaid positions, including:
* Duke University, Visiting Professor of the Practice of Public Policy Studies
* Institute for the Danube and Central Europe (IDM), Chairman
* Europaeum, Member of the Board of Trustees
* European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), Member

Every year Busek and Oliver Vujovic, SEEMO Secretary General, award the annual Erhard Busek SEEMO Award for Better Understanding in South East Europe, in collaboration with the South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) in Vienna.

<doc id="987666" wikidata="Q1208749" url="?curid=987666" title="Kurobe Dam">
<text>The , or , is a high variable-radius arch dam located on the Kurobe River in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The tallest dam in Japan, it supports the 335 MW Kurobe No. 4 Hydropower Plant and is owned by Kansai Electric Power Company. It was constructed between 1956 and 1963 at a cost of 51.3 billion yen. The project had taken the lives of 171 people by its completion.

==History==

In 1951, the Kansai Electric Power Company was formed to provide electric power for the Kansai region of Japan. Shortly after their formation, the area suffered from drought, which caused power rationing. The drought, along with the rapid growth of post–World War II Japan, pushed the company to increase their generating capacity. After a series of geological and hydrological studies of the Kurobe River and Gorge, it was announced in late 1955 that the Kurobe Dam would be constructed.

In July 1956, construction on the dam began. Problems quickly arose while transporting material to the construction site as only one small railway existed through the narrow gorge. Kansai decided to construct the Kanden Tunnel under Mount Akazawa that could efficiently bring supplies from Ōmachi eastward towards the construction site. The tunnel&#x27;s construction proved an arduous task as a large fracture zone in the rock was encountered which took seven months to repair. In September 1959, the first concrete for the dam was placed and by October next year, the reservoir had begun to fill.

The Kurobe No. 4 power station was built completely underground to protect it from common avalanches in the gorge and also for nature conservation purposes. By January 1961, two of Kurobe No. 4&#x27;s Pelton turbines had begun operation at an initial capacity of 154 MW. In August 1962, the third turbine was in operation and by June 1963, the dam was complete at a final cost of ¥ 51.3 billion ($142.5 million (1963)). In 1973, a fourth turbine was installed and became operational; bringing the power station&#x27;s production capacity to 335 MW. The fourth turbine cost ¥ 1.4 billion yen ($5 million (1973)). The first two turbines were manufactured by Voith and the last two by Japan&#x27;s Hitachi. The dam initiated the development of Japan&#x27;s first 275kV transmission system as well which allowed the transfer of electricity over greater distances.

==Specifications==

The Kurobe Dam is a long and high, variable-radius (dome) arch dam. The dam is wide at its base, wide at its crest and contains of concrete. The dam is flanked and supported by two &quot;wing&quot; dams which form the abutments; the one on the left bank is long and the right is . The dam withholds a reservoir with a capacity of of which is live (active or &quot;useful&quot;) storage. The reservoir also has a catchment area of and surface area of . The dam&#x27;s spillway is located on its crest and contains 10 wide uncontrolled openings with a maximum discharge capacity of . Three other openings exist in the dam&#x27;s orifice which consist of diameter pipes, two of which can discharge a maximum of each and the third . The dam&#x27;s crest elevation is above sea level while the reservoir&#x27;s normal operating level is and low level is considered .

The dam&#x27;s power station, Kurobe No. 4, is located underground and contains four generators which are powered by Pelton turbines for a total installed capacity of 335 MW and average annual generation of 1 billion kWh. The power station is wide, high and long. The penstock serving water to the power station is long and utilizes a maximum effective hydraulic head of while transferring a maximum of to the turbines. The plant&#x27;s surge chamber is long and high.

==Access==

The Kurobe Dam is the most popular hydropower site in Japan and, between late June and mid-October, water is released from its spillway for onlookers. The surrounding Kurobe Gorge is popular as well and is accessible by the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route.

Starting from Toyama Station, visitors can take a combination of trains, cable cars, buses, and walking to access the dam. The whole trip from Toyama Station takes roughly four hours to complete one-way, and costs around 10,000 yen($66.68 USD) in transportation fees. Various accommodations are available in Murodo area as well as near Tateyama Station, for those too tired to make the trip back down into Toyama City.

== In popular culture ==
The novel &quot;The Sun of Kurobe&quot; (黒部の太陽; Kurobe no Taiyō) dramatizes the construction of the dam. It was adapted into the 1968 film &quot;The Sands of Kurobe&quot;, which focuses on the perils that the construction of the dam and Kanden Tunnel entailed and other circumstances that took a high toll on human life. 

The television series &quot;Project X: Chôsensha tachi&quot; (2000-2005) was also based on the dam&#x27;s construction. 

The final arc of the 2004 &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; anime, which takes place in a fictionalized 1950s Japan, heavily involves the construction of the Kurobe Dam.

The 1961 kaiju film &quot;Mothra&quot; includes an action sequence filmed at the dam before its completion. Mothra&#x27;s attack causes the dam to break.

Kurobe dam can be seen in the 1964 film &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;.

Kurobe Dam features prominently in the opening scene of the 1966 film &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot;, in which Gamera attacks the facility’s hydroelectric plant to obtain energy in the form of fire. The dam itself then bursts after Gamera collides with it twice while flying away.

The 2000 action thriller &quot;Whiteout&quot; was shot in and around Kurobe Dam, renamed Okutowa Dam in the film.

The mecha anime television series &quot;Kuromukuro&quot; (2016) is mainly set in a UN research facility located around the lake.

<doc id="987673" wikidata="Q1546234" url="?curid=987673" title="Rumtek Monastery">
<text>Rumtek Monastery (), also called the Dharma Chakra Centre, is a gompa located in the Indian state of Sikkim near the capital Gangtok. It is the seat in exile of the Gyalwang Karmapa, inaugurated in 1966 by the 16th Karmapa. It is also a focal point for the sectarian tensions within the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism that characterize the 17th Karmapa controversy.

==History==
Originally built under the direction of Changchub Dorje, 12th Karmapa Lama in the mid-18th century, Rumtek served as the main seat of the Karma Kagyu lineage in Sikkim for some time. But when Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa, arrived in Sikkim in 1959 after fleeing Tibet, the monastery was in ruins. Despite being offered other sites, the Karmapa decided to rebuild Rumtek. To him, the site possessed many auspicious qualities and was surrounded by the most favorable attributes. For example, flowing streams, mountains behind, a snow range in front, and a river below. With the generosity and help of the Sikkim royal family and the local folks of Sikkim, it was built by the 16th Karmapa as his main seat in exile.

After four years, construction of the monastery was completed. The sacred items and relics brought out from Tsurphu Monastery, the Karmapa&#x27;s seat in Tibet, were installed. On Losar in 1966, the 16th Karmapa officially inaugurated the new seat, called &quot;The Dharmachakra Centre&quot;, a place of erudition and spiritual accomplishment, the seat of the glorious Karmapa.

The monastery is currently the largest in Sikkim. It is home to the community of monks and where they perform the rituals and practices of the Karma Kagyu lineage. A golden stupa contains the relics of the 16th Karmapa. Opposite that building is a college, Karma Shri Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies.

Rumtek is located from Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, at an altitude of about .

==Controversy==
Rumtek was in the centre of the Karmapa controversy, with a lengthy battle which played out in the Indian courts. Two rival organisations, each supporting a different candidate for the 17th Karmapa, claimed stewardship of the monastery and its contents. The two organisations are the Tsurphu Labrang (supporting Ogyen Trinley Dorje) and the Karmapa Charitable Trust (supporting Trinley Thaye Dorje). Neither candidate resides, nor has been enthroned, at Rumtek. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned at Tsurphu Monastery. Ogyen Trinley Dorje&#x27;s followers maintain that the trust was established solely for the sake of seeing to the welfare of the Karmapa&#x27;s followers, providing funds for the maintenance of the monastery, and for the monks&#x27; medical fees. The administration of the monastery was the responsibility of the Tsurphu Labrang, which was organized as a legal entity for a related case:

In 1982, Shamar Rinpoche and his cousin, Topga Yugyal, gained control of the estate at Rumtek monastery a month after the 16th Karmapa&#x27;s passing. Three monasteries in Bhutan were sold, and control was gained over the Karmapa Charitable Trust, organized in 1961 by the 16th Karmapa. Disagreements over the Shamarpa&#x27;s and Topga&#x27;s financial dealings began in 1988. Beginning in 1992, the monastery became the site of pitched battles between monks supporting one candidate or the other.

Control of Rumtek Monastery became the subject of a legal contest filed in 1998 &quot;by the Karmapa Charitable Trust, [and the plaintiffs] Shri T.S. Gyaltshen, Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche, and Shri Gyan Jyoti Kansakar against the State of Sikkim, the Secretary of Ecclessiastical Affairs and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche. The plaintiffs seek to evict the monks and other occupants of Dhama Chakra Centre, Rumtek and to possess and administer the monastery for their own purposes.&quot;

In 2003, monks supporting Trinley Thaye Dorje were thrown out of Rumtek by Indian security forces in order to quell violence between the two factions, and armed Indian soldiers patrol the monastery to prevent further sectarian violence.

<doc id="987677" wikidata="Q392805" url="?curid=987677" title="Central European Initiative">
<text>The Central European Initiative (CEI) is a forum of regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe, counting 17 member states. It was formed in Budapest in 1989. The body was developed on the basis of earlier experiences with The Alps-Adriatic Working Group. The CEI headquarters have been in Trieste, Italy, since 1996.

==History==
The Central European Initiative or CEI, is the largest and oldest forum of regional cooperation in Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe. It now counts 17 member states, based on region and democratic values: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The origin of the Central European Initiative lies in the creation of what was then known as the Quadragonale in Budapest on 11 November 1989 whose founding members were Italy, Austria, Hungary and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). The conjunction with the fall of the Berlin Wall was a coincidence, yet the CEI has been involved in democratizing Eastern European countries after the Soviet Bloc dissolved.

The Initiative aimed at overcoming the division in blocks by re-establishing cooperation links, among countries of different political orientations and economic structures. This was largely headed by Italy, who at the time, wanted greater involvement in supporting Eastern European countries in order to rival a newly reunited Germany.

At the first Summit in Venice in 1990, Czechoslovakia was admitted and the Initiative was renamed Pentagonale. In 1991, with the admission of Poland it became the Hexagonale.

The organization was renamed Central European Initiative (CEI) from the Hexagonale in 1992, and has held the name since. On the same occasion, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were admitted as member states. That year, Yugoslavia&#x27;s recognition ceased, due to a violent break ups of the nation and the recognition of Croatia and Slovakia as independent nations. The Czech Republic and Slovakia were admitted to the CEI in 1993 following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In 1996, Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine joined the CEI as full-fledged members.

In recent years the CEI has focused on expanding healthcare access within its 17 member states. It has partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to focus on preventing unwanted consequences from the pandemic and the sharing of health information. They have met regularly since this partnership was founded in June of 2022, with the most recent meeting happening November 2024. In the latest meeting, the organizations focused on health in the Western Balkans, implementing focus on integration following the EU model.

== Structures ==
The structure of the CEI is unique, with changing staff, headquarters or budget. It operates through regular forums, usually held in November that invite senior officials and politicians. There are 5 regular meetings, 
* Heads of State/Government Meeting (annually, in the autumn);
* Parliamentary Dimension (the CEI Parliamentary Committee which meets in the spring and the CEI Parliamentary Conference which meets in the autumn);
* Foreign Ministers Meeting (annually, in the spring, but Foreign Ministers also attend and take part in the Heads of Government meeting);
* Special Meetings of Sectoral Ministers;
* Meetings of the Committee of National Coordinators (monthly)

One member state of the CEI takes on the role of the presidency each year, leading forums and meetings. In 1995, the Heads of Government meeting adopted an official documentation of the rules, guidelines and definition of the CEI. &quot;forum for cooperation in the region&#x27; which &#x27;does not replace other, bilateral and multilateral channels of cooperation, neither affects the commitments of the Member States resulting of their respective international agreements&quot;. It has a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to promote regional cooperation and growth, particularly in newly democratic states.

The CEI has a three-pillar system: It cooperates in a governmental dimension, a parliamentary dimension and a business dimension.

It promotes connectivity and diversity through 6 main areas: Good governance, economic growth, media freedom, environmental protection, intercultural cooperation and scientific cooperation/education &amp; training. The CEI implements its activities through cooperative activities, such as Working Groups, EU-projects, Know-how exchange programme and technical cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Each working group is chaired by a different country and has a unique focus. Since 2019, Roberto Antonione (Italy) has been the secretary general.

<doc id="987680" wikidata="Q5599252" url="?curid=987680" title="Great Glen Fault">
<text>The Great Glen Fault is a strike-slip fault that runs through the Great Glen in Scotland. Occasional moderate tremors have been recorded over the past 150 years.

==Location==
Aligned northeast to southwest, the Great Glen Fault extends further southwest in a straight line through Loch Linnhe and the Firth of Lorne, and then on into northwestern Ireland, directly through Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay and Clew Bay as the Leannan Fault. To the northeast the fault connects to the Walls Boundary Fault and the associated Melby Fault and Nestings Fault, before becoming obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting to the north of Shetland.

The fault continues on the North American side of the North Atlantic Ocean, but is no longer part of a contiguous fault, as the complete fault was broken when the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed 200 million years ago. The North American side of the fault runs through the length of northwestern Newfoundland, Canada, as the Cabot Fault (Long Range Fault) and on into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is at least long.

==Geological history==
The Great Glen Fault has a long movement history. It formed towards the end of the Caledonian orogeny associated with the collision between the Laurentia and Baltic tectonic plates at the end of the Silurian continuing into the Early Devonian (likely age range 430–390 Ma (million years)). The movement at that time was sinistral (left-lateral), the same as the closely related set of faults sub-parallel to the main part of the Great Glen Fault, which include the Strathconon Fault and Strathglass Faults to the northwest and the Laggan Fault, Tyndrum Fault, and Ericht-Laidon Fault to the southeast. The second main phase of movement was during the Carboniferous, this time with a dextral sense.

The exact timing is uncertain, but associated folds within the Devonian are cut by members of the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian dyke swarm. The Great Glen Fault had its final phase of movement during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary. The displacement is estimated to be 64 miles (104 km).

Erosion along the fault zone during Quaternary glaciation formed Loch Ness.

==Recent history==
In the 19th century, a boat canal known as the Caledonian Canal was dug through the Great Glen; the canal is still used today.

==Seismic activity==
There is not agreement about whether the Great Glen Fault is &quot;active&quot; – accumulating seismic slip. Some parts of the fault are moving in opposite directions, but the extent of displacement is not agreed on. The displacement could be at least the full length of the exposed fault on mainland Scotland.

Most researchers consider the fault active or a &quot;reactivated strike-slip fault within the continental crust&quot; that is accumulating tectonic strain. Some researchers say the observed seismic activity of the last 300 years does not support a theory of re-activation. According to Roger Musson, the fault does not show any signs of present activity. Musson places the 1901 Inverness earthquake on a secondary fault of the Great Glen Fault.

Occasional moderate tremors have been recorded over the past 150 years. Accordingly seismic buffers were incorporated into the Kessock Bridge carrying the A9 road out of Inverness.

<text>Maureen F. McHugh (born February 13, 1959) is an American science fiction and fantasy writer.

== Career ==

McHugh&#x27;s first published story was published as a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; under a male pseudonym in 1988. It was followed by a pair of publications under her own name in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in 1989. Since then, she has written four novels and over twenty short stories. 

Her first novel, &quot;China Mountain Zhang&quot; (1992), was nominated for both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award, and won the James Tiptree, Jr. Award. In 1996 she won a Hugo Award for her short story &quot;The Lincoln Train&quot; (1995). Her short story collection &quot;Mothers and Other Monsters&quot; was shortlisted as a finalist for The Story Prize in December 2005.

McHugh has worked as a writer and/or managing editor for numerous alternate reality game projects, including &quot;Year Zero&quot; and &quot;I Love Bees&quot; for 42 Entertainment. Since 2009 she has been a partner at No Mimes Media, an alternate reality game company that she co-founded with Steve Peters and Behnam Karbassi.

<text>Llanddoged is a small village which lies in the hills a little over a mile to the north of Llanrwst, in Conwy county borough, Wales. The village itself has a small population, with a surrounding rural farming community. Most of the population are Welsh speakers. Llanddoged shares its community council with the rural community of Maenan.
Llanddoged has two small hamlets attached to it - Groesffordd and Tan-lan. Groesffordd has a motor repair garage known as &#x27;Garej Groesffordd&#x27;. Tan-lan was known for its notorious bends on the A470 where, before road improvements, many road traffic collisions had occurred. Tan-lan is also home to an Environment Agency Wales depot.

== Amenities ==
It has a primary school, Ysgol Llanddoged, and education is delivered through the medium of Welsh. Many of the children at the school are from Llanddoged or Maenan but some also from Llanrwst. The school hall also acts as a community centre. Several organisations such as &#x27;Merched y Wawr&#x27; and the Women&#x27;s Institute also meet here.

The village has views on the many walking paths and routes that circle it. There is also a small playground park and playing field, known as &#x27;Cae Cetyn&#x27;.

The parish church is called Eglwys St Doged, after whom the village is named. The church is part of the diocese of St Asaph within the Church in Wales. Services are conducted Bilingually every Sunday from 9:30 to 10:30.

== Ras Fawr Llanddoged ==
Every year the village is host to &#x27;Ras fawr Llanddoged&#x27; (Welsh for: &quot;Llanddoged&#x27;s Great Race&quot;). The race is run over 10 km, mostly uphill, course. Approximately 60 people race each year.
The race was started by Arfon Jones, Ffrith Galed.

== History ==
Saint Doged&#x27;s Church, set in a circular churchyard in Llanddoged, was rebuilt in 1839, but was originally a sixth-century martyrium constructed to shelter the grave of Saint Doged. It is Grade II* listed. Nearby, the waters of Saint Doged&#x27;s Well were reputed to cure eye-disorders. The church is open to visitors and inside still has the original layout, with a large seating box for each wealthy family and seats for their servants behind. Some old house names can still be seen on the doors. The area across the aisle was provided for the villagers to use.
The church also has three pews above each other, much like a chapel. The altar is at the front of the church, before the village seating but diagonal to the families with their own seating boxes. 
An old well can be seen behind the church to which the myths above relate.
The church originally had 12 trees planted around it to signify the 12 disciples with Christ in the middle. Unfortunately, now there are only 10 trees standing around the church.

A Roman road passes close to Llanddoged, indicated by the nearby place-name: &#x27;Sarn Ddu&#x27; shown on the map as the name of the local sewage works. &quot;Sarn&quot;, which means causeway in Welsh, has been commonly used to name Roman roads such as Sarn Helen, also in Roman Wales. Sarn is also used to indicate defences against water (flood, tide) where these, like Roman roads, involve significant built-up lines of layers of stones. There are also indications of a causeway.

A possible route on which this may stand is a NNW-SSE road starting close to the edge of the east bank of Afon Conwy, just SE of the Tan-yr-Allt building in Coed Bortho, facing the confirmed Roman fort at Caerhun, suggesting this road may have been to a Ferry or ford. It may have run SSE via Sarn Ddu towards Nebo, &amp; the A5, but this is still being researched. Another possible route is a WSW-ENE road the route of which may run close to the nearby &quot;Caer Faban&quot;, another unconfirmed possible Roman site, in which case Llanddoged / Sarn Ddu may stand in the vicinity of Roman crossroads.

<text>Jarrow Hall (formerly Bede&#x27;s World) is a museum in Jarrow, South Tyneside, England which celebrates the life of the Venerable Bede; a monk, author and scholar who lived in at the Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Wearmouth-Jarrow, a double monastery at Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, (today part of Sunderland), England.

The site features a museum dedicated to the life and times of the famous monk, with other features and attractions – including a reconstructed Anglo-Saxon farm and the 18th-century Georgian building Jarrow Hall House itself – reflected in a calendar of activities, including special themed events, an educational programme for schools and heritage skills workshops, alongside space for businesses and events.

==History==
The Anglo-Saxon attraction Bede&#x27;s World opened on an 11-acre site in Jarrow in 1993 at a cost of almost £10 million, and was run by the Bede&#x27;s World Charitable Trust, with grant support from the local council. Although the complex attracted 70,000 visitors a year, it became no longer financially viable and ceased operation in February 2016.

The writer and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg was critical of its closure, and in an item on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; in 2016, he contrasted the museum&#x27;s plight to the large funding made available to the Garden Bridge Project in London, which was eventually cancelled.

==Reopening and relaunch==
It was announced in August 2016 that the former Bede&#x27;s World site would re-open as &#x27;Jarrow Hall Anglo-Saxon Farm, Village and Bede Museum&#x27;, to be managed by the charity Groundwork&#x27;s South Tyneside and Newcastle trust.

Following over £100,000 of investment by Groundwork and a soft-open in October 2016, the site fully launched on 8 April 2017, hosting activities for all ages including farm talks, live re-enactment combat, authentic Anglo-Saxon craft and lectures, as well as the reconstructed historical dwellings being renovated by authentically attired workers using traditional wattle and daub building techniques. The interior of Jarrow Hall House was also renovated with Georgian-era expertise provided by Durham University, and hosts a new coffee shop, Hive Coffee Company. The direction and development of the site during the relaunch period were led by Leigh Venus, former Venue Manager of Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s historic Tyneside Cinema.

==Current features==
The Bede Museum building features an &quot;Age of Bede&quot; exhibit, which includes excavated artefacts from the historic monastery such as stained glass, imported pottery, coins and stone carvings, and exhibits about Anglo-Saxon culture, Bede&#x27;s life and works, the life of a monk, and the medieval Kingdom of Northumbria.

There is a working reconstructed Anglo-Saxon farm called Gyrwe (pronounced &quot;Yeerweh&quot;) after the Old English name for Jarrow, showing animal husbandry with full-size reconstructions of three timber buildings from Northumbria based on the evidence of archaeological work. Thirlings Hall was the largest, with animal hide and other objects. A wood-burning fire in the form of a small pit/designated area is used throughout the year, and allows for a great smell to filter through the building. The two other buildings, smaller in size, are a &quot;grubenhaus&quot; – a sunken building used as a cold store – and a monk&#x27;s cell. All buildings are thatched and were built using traditional techniques.

The farm animals are of similar breeds to animals that would have been present circa 1300 years ago, to simulate the types of animals which would have been seen in Anglo-Saxon England; cattle are smaller and sheep more varied, before selective breeding methods were introduced. Ancient strains of wheat and vegetables, such as those the monks might have eaten, used to be selectively grown on site.

Visitors are able to tour the ruins of the Anglo-Saxon monastery of St Paul, which has been designated a scheduled monument.

The site also features a coffee shop located in Jarrow Hall House, an 18th-century Georgian property adjacent to the Bede Museum. The house was renovated in 2017. The Medieval herb garden at the rear of Jarrow Hall House features over 200 species of herbs, and there is a gift shop within the Bede Museum. The site also house events and conference facilities, both within Jarrow Hall House and the Bede Museum building.

<text>Yvonne Harrison Castro, also spelled Ivonne (born December 2, 1975 in New York City) is a Puerto Rican athlete who specialized in the 400 metres hurdles. She competed at two World Junior Championships, two World Championships, one World Indoor Championships and one Olympic Games.

==Biography==
Harrison grew up in Throggs Neck, The Bronx, where she was one of the top high school athletes in the U.S. competing for Herbert H. Lehman High School. As a 16 year old, she knew Carl Lewis and claimed to be &quot;practically... best friends&quot; with Florence Griffith-Joyner before her death.

In 1998 she finished second in the 1998 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships for the Illinois Fighting Illini track and field team. In the same year she was eliminated in the heats at the 1998 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships (400 metres) and the 1998 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. The next year, she reached the final and finished 7th at the 1999 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—improving to a 6th place at the 2000 United States Olympic trials.

In 2001 she changed athletic allegiance to Puerto Rico, immediately winning the gold medal in 400 metres hurdles at the 2001 Central American and Caribbean Championships as well as a silver medal in the 4 × 400 metres relay. At the 2001 World Championships she competed in both 400 metres hurdles and 4 × 400 metres relay, achieving Puerto Rican records in both events. In 2002 she continued to win the 2002 Central American and Caribbean Games and the bronze medal at the 2002 Ibero-American Championships.
At the latter, she also won a relay bronze.

In 2003 she participated in the indoor season, running the 400 metres in the heats of the 2003 World Indoor Championships, before starting her outdoor season in South Africa the same month. She attended meets in Martinique, Japan and Europe and won the Puerto Rican Championships before heading to the international championships. Harrison won the silver medal at the 2003 Central American and Caribbean Championships. At the 2003 Pan American Games, she finished fifth in the 400 metres hurdles and sixth in the 4 × 400 metres relay. She also participated at the 2003 World Championships without finishing the race.

Newspapers such as El Vocero and El Nuevo Dia covered her accomplishments extensively.

She finished eighth at the 2004 Japan Grand Prix in Osaka and seventh at the Grande Premio Rio de Atletismo in Rio. After that, she sustained an injury that required her to take a rest from competition for a while. She returned to attend the Golden Gala and other meets in Europe, including the KBC Night of Athletics, before winning the bronze medal at the 2004 Ibero-American Championships. Harrison subsequently made her Olympic debut at the 2004 Olympic Games, being eliminated in the heats. Competing sparingly in 2005 and 2006, she did win another bronze medal at the 2006 Ibero-American Championships, this time held in Puerto Rico, and competed at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games without finishing her race.

==Coaching career==
She was, as of 2022, an assistant sprint coach at Saint Joseph’s University alongside Michael Glavin.

<doc id="987722" wikidata="Q975736" url="?curid=987722" title="Richard Eberhart">
<text>Richard Ghormley Eberhart (April 5, 1904 – June 9, 2005) was an American poet who published more than a dozen books of poetry and approximately twenty works in total. &quot;Richard Eberhart emerged out of the 1930s as a modern stylist with romantic sensibilities.&quot; He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;Selected Poems, 1930–1965&quot; and the 1977 National Book Award for Poetry for &quot;Collected Poems, 1930–1976&quot;. He was the grandfather of Pittsburgh Pirates general manager Ben Cherington.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Eberhart was born in 1904 in Austin, a small city in southeast Minnesota. He grew up on an estate of called Burr Oaks, since partitioned into hundreds of residential lots. He published a volume of poetry called &quot;Burr Oaks&quot; in 1947, and many of his poems reflect his youth in rural America.

Eberhart began college at the University of Minnesota, but following his mother&#x27;s death from cancer in 1921—the event which prompted him to begin writing poetry—he transferred to Dartmouth College. After graduation he worked as a ship&#x27;s hand, among other jobs, then studied at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where I.A. Richards encouraged him to continue writing poetry, and where he took a further degree. After serving as private tutor to the son of King Prajadhipok of Siam in 1931–1932, Eberhart pursued graduate study for a year at Harvard University. During his time at Harvard, Eberhart met and spoke with T. S. Eliot.

His first book of poetry, &quot;A Bravery of Earth&quot;, was published in London in 1930. It reflected his experiences in Cambridge and his experience as a ship&#x27;s hand. &quot;Reading the Spirit&quot;, published in 1937, contains one of his best-known poems, &quot;The Groundhog&quot;.

He taught for eight years at the St. Mark&#x27;s School (1933–1941), where Robert Lowell was one of his students. In 1941 he married Helen Butcher. They had two children.

During World War II he held the rank of Lieutenant Commander and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve; this experience led him to write another of his most celebrated poems, &quot;The Fury of Aerial Bombardment&quot;, the first three stanzas of which, are in effect a prayer:

::Was man made stupid to see his own stupidity?&quot;
::&quot;Is God by definition indifferent, beyond us all?&quot;
::&quot;Is the eternal truth man&#x27;s fighting soul&quot;
::&quot;Wherein the Beast ravens in its own avidity?&quot;

===Career===
In 1945, Eberhart published &quot;Poems: New and Selected&quot;, containing &quot;The Fury of Aerial Bombardment&quot; and other poems written during his service including &quot;Dam Neck, Virginia&quot; and &quot;World War&quot;. He also edited &quot;War and the Poet: An Anthology of Poetry Expressing Man&#x27;s Reactions to the Present&quot; claiming to be the first collection of poems based on war.

After the war, Eberhart worked for six years for his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s floor wax company, the Butcher Polish Company. &quot;Burr Oaks&quot; was his first work published after the war in 1947 followed by &quot;Brotherhood of Men&quot; in 1949. In 1950 he was a founder of the Poets&#x27; Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

From the early 1950s until his retirement, he dedicated himself to writing poems and teaching at institutions of higher education, including the University of Washington, Brown University, Swarthmore College, Tufts University, Trinity College, University of Connecticut, Columbia University, University of Cincinnati, University of Florida, Wheaton College, St. Marks School, Princeton University and Dartmouth College. He taught for 30 years at Dartmouth as professor of English and poet-in-residence, where he was known for his encouragement of young poets.

Eberhart published &quot;Undercliff: Poems 1946–1953&quot; containing &quot;Fragment of New York&quot; in 1953. Eberhart wrote a number of dramatic works in the 1950s and early 1960s which were performed regionally. These works included &quot;The Apparition&quot;, &quot;The Visionary Farms&quot;, &quot;Triptych&quot;, &quot;The Mad Musicians&quot; and &quot;Devils and Angels&quot;. In 1962, these works were published as &quot;Collected Verse Plays&quot;.

Eberhart was sent to San Francisco by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to report on the Beat poetry scene. Eberhart wrote a piece published in the September 2, 1956, &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; entitled &quot;West Coast Rhythms&quot; that helped call national attention to the Beat generation, and especially to Allen Ginsberg as the author of &quot;Howl&quot;, which he called &quot;the most remarkable poem of the young group.&quot; Ginsberg credited Eberhart&#x27;s article with &quot;breaking the ice&quot; for the Beats in regard to getting them published.

President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Eberhart a member of the Advisory Committee on the Arts for the National Cultural Centre in 1959. Also, Eberhart was Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress for 1959–61 and was awarded a Bollingen Prize in 1962.

<text>&quot;The Masks&quot; is episode 145 of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on March 20, 1964 on CBS. In this episode, set on Mardi Gras, a dying man coerces his relatives into wearing grotesque masks that reflect their true personalities.

==Opening narration==
== Plot ==
On the night of Mardi Gras, wealthy Jason Foster is attended to by his physician, Dr. Samuel Thorne, who warns him that his death is imminent. Cranky and candid, Jason is not cheered by the arrival from Boston of his cowardly hypochondriac daughter, Emily Harper, and her family: greedy businessman husband Wilfred; oafish, sadistic grandson Wilfred Jr.; and vain granddaughter Paula.

After openly insulting the Harpers, Foster says he has a special Mardi Gras party planned for them. Following dinner, the family gathers in Foster&#x27;s study, where he instructs them to put on special one-of-a-kind masks that he says were &quot;crafted by an old Cajun.&quot; Explaining that an old Mardi Gras custom involves wearing a mask that is the opposite of one&#x27;s true personality, Foster sarcastically gives a sniveling coward mask to Emily, a porcine-featured miser to Wilfred, a brutish buffoon to Wilfred Jr., and a narcissist to Paula while he dons a skull mask, saying that it represents death as opposed to his inherent vivacity. The Harpers initially refuse to participate until Foster correctly accuses them of only being there to claim his fortune upon his death. He then informs them that the terms of his will require them to wear the masks until midnight in order to inherit his estate; if any of them unmasks before then, all four will receive only their return train fare to Boston.

The Harpers reluctantly concede, but as the hours pass, they beg to remove their masks, saying that they are unbearable. However, Foster delivers a final tirade, calling them all caricatures before dying as the clock strikes midnight. The Harpers rejoice in their newly inherited wealth and unmask, but discover to their horror, that their faces now conform to the hideous features of their masks. Foster&#x27;s face, on the other hand, proves to be superficially unchanged. Dr. Thorne observes, &quot;This must be death. No horror, no fear, nothing but peace.&quot;

<text>Alois Mock (; 10 June 1934 – 1 June 2017) was an Austrian politician and member of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP). He was Vice Chancellor of Austria from 1987 to 1989. As foreign minister, he helped take Austria into the European Union.

==Life==
Born in Euratsfeld, Lower Austria, to August and Mathilde Mock, he studied law at the University of Vienna and later international law in Bologna and Brussels. In Vienna, he became a member of K.A.V. Norica Wien, a Roman Catholic student fraternity, which is a member of the Cartellverband. From 1961, he advised Austrian chancellor Josef Klaus on European Economic Community and EFTA policies. From 1962 till 1966, he worked at Austria&#x27;s mission to the OECD in Paris. In 1966, he became Klaus&#x27;s cabinet secretary. From 1969 to 1970 was the youngest education minister in Austrian history.

After the parliamentary elections 1971 - in which the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) under Bruno Kreisky won a majority — he became a member of parliament and mayor of Euratsfeld. From 1971 to 1978, he chaired the ÖAAB, the most important grouping of the ÖVP. From 1978 to 1987, he was the leader of the ÖVP parliamentary group, and from 1979, he also was ÖVP federal party chairman. He was later to be succeeded by Josef Riegler, Erhard Busek and Wolfgang Schüssel. In 1979, Mock became President of the European Democrat Union (EDU), and from 1983 to 1987 also was president of the International Democratic Union (IDU). At the 1983 elections, the ÖVP obtained nearly the same percentage as Kreisky&#x27;s SPÖ. Kreisky didn&#x27;t want to go on without an absolute majority and stepped down. 

Following the 1986 elections, Alois Mock was Austrian vice chancellor in the government of Franz Vranitzky (SPÖ) from 1987 to 1989. From 1987 to 1995, he was foreign minister, leading Austria into the European Union. He became one of Austria&#x27;s most popular politicians. In June 1989, together with his Hungarian colleague Gyula Horn, he cut the wires of the Iron Curtain near Sopron at the fortified border to Communist neighbour Hungary. As a result, during the following months, thousands of East German citizens were able to exit the Eastern Bloc 

In 1991, he urged Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Helmut Kohl to recognize Croatia and Slovenia as independent states as soon as possible.

In November 1989 Mock was one of the founders of the Central European cooperative Pentagonale, which later grew from 5 countries to 18 of the CEI (Central European Initiative). In 1999, he retired from parliament because of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. At the time of his death, Mock was a Member of the Advisory Board of the Global Panel Foundation, an NGO that works behind the scenes in crisis areas around the world.

==Death==
Mock died on 1 June 2017 from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 82.

<text>Christos Tzekos (or Tsekos) is a Greek athletics coach.

He was the trainer of the sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou. The three were at the center of a huge doping scandal at the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics. The athletes were suspended by the IAAF in December 2004 but have been free to compete since December, 2006. Tsekos is serving a 4-year suspension handed down by the Greek athletics federation in 2005.

Tsekos, a former nutritional supplements salesman who lives alternatingly in his native Greece and his adopted home in Lincolnwood, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), had been involved in a number of doping-related incidents before.

In 1997, at an athletics event in Dortmund, Germany, a row occurred between Tsekos and an IAAF doping controller whom he prevented from testing four of his athletes, among them Thanou and Charis Papadias. However, the doping controller, Klaus Wengoborski, arrived with no identification and without a female official accompanying him, a violation of IAAF regulations at the time. The Greek federation nevertheless suspended Tzekos but no action was taken against the athletes. The IAAF agreed with the Greek federation&#x27;s ruling.&lt;ref name=&#x27;Turkish Daily News 07/30/1997&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greek national health authority fined Tsekos 14.800 euros for illegally importing anabolic substances. In 2004 a raid on his office uncovered 1400 ampoules containing anabolic and other prohibited substances. Some sources say that these were just supplements without the appropriate legal papers for import in Greece.

According to &quot;To Vima&quot;, a respected Greek daily newspaper, Tsekos had proposed a secret program to the Greek government in 1997, which was projected at a cost of 6 million euros and was intended to provide 150 Greek athletes with non-detectable doping substances in preparation for the 2004 Olympic Games. The government declined the offer. Tzekos had also stated on Greek TV channel Antenna that he has great admiration for the GDR sports program.

In 2003, it was reported that U.S. authorities found e-mails by Victor Conte addressed to Tzekos while searching BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), the California company secretly dealing Tetrahydrogestrinone, an anabolic steroid specially designed so as to make it undetectable under normal drug testing. In addition, according to the respected French paper &quot;L&#x27;Equipe,&quot; Tzekos was directly dealing with the creator of norbolethone and THG (tetrahydrogestrinone) Patrick Arnold, the father of pro-hormone craze and some undetectable designer steroids.

However, in September 2007, Greek prosecutors ruled there was no evidence supporting any connection between Tzekos and BALCO, after examining evidence sent from the district attorney of northern California.&lt;ref name=&#x27;IHT 10/30/2007&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tzekos has also continued to insist that he only knew Patrick Arnold as a supplier of nutritional supplements, and has denied receiving illegal substances from him.

<text>The Coast to Coast or Sea to Sea Cycle Route (C2C) is a cycle route opened in 1994. Combining sections of National Cycle Route 7, 14, 71 and 72; it runs from Whitehaven or Workington on the west coast of Cumbria, and then crosses the Lake District and the Pennines in the north of England by using a variety of both on and off-road trails, ending on the north-east coast in Tyne and Wear at Sunderland or Tynemouth. Sustrans state that it is the UK&#x27;s most popular challenge cycle route, it is designed for the whole range of cyclists, from families to cycling club riders. Although a challenge with some hard climbsthe highest point being over the C2C is completed by an average of between 12,800 and 15,000 cyclists every year.

== History ==
The C2C is part of the UK National Cycle Network (NCN), and was developed by Sustrans in partnership with various local authorities, Groundwork West Cumbria, North Pennines Tourism Partnership, Forest Enterprise and the Lake District National Park amongst others. The route was opened in 1994 running from Whitehaven on the west coast of Cumbria to the north-east coast at Sunderland. A northern branch splits off from the main route at Consett, following the route of the Derwent Walk, passing through Tyneside and ending at Tynemouth.

In 2005 a complementary route was opened further to the south. This, titled the Walney to Wear route (W2W), is designed to be slightly tougher and longer. It runs from Walney Island in south-west Cumbria to Sunderland via the North York Moors and Durham.

== Art ==

A number of public artworks have been commissioned for the route, including Tony Cragg&#x27;s &quot;Terris Novalis&quot; at Consett, sheepfolds by Andy Goldsworthy at various points in Cumbria and Alison Wilding&#x27;s &quot;Ambit&quot; in the River Wear at Sunderland. Eduardo Chillida had been commissioned to create a work for Whitehaven, but the project has not been completed.

On the Consett to Sunderland line, there are &quot;The Old Transformers&quot; by David Kemp below Pontop Pike mast near Annfield Plain and four steel cows by Sally Matthews near Beamish Museum.

== Route ==
The route has two alternative start points in West Cumbria at Whitehaven and at Workington, before travelling through the stunning scenery of the western and northern Lake District. The Workington route runs via Cockermouth to Keswick, while the Whitehaven route runs via Loweswater to Keswick before passing through Penrith and the Eden Valley with its lush valleys and sandstone villages. It then starts the climb up to Hartside Pass and onto the Northern Pennines—the &quot;roof of England&quot;. There then follows an undulating ride as the C2C meanders through old lead-mining villages, such as Garrigill, Nenthead and Rookhope, and down into the Durham Dales before crossing Waskerley Moor and entering the old steel town of Consett via the Hownes Gill Viaduct.

From Consett it&#x27;s an easy ride via Leadgate, Annfield Plain, Stanley, Beamish and through one of Britain&#x27;s old industrial heartlands to the North Sea and Sunderland. There is also the option of starting at Workington and/or finishing at Tynemouth and also a link route at Penrith to join up with the Glasgow to Carlisle section of the National Cycle Route. The route is made up of approximately:

*main roads—mainly short sections through urban areas—4%
*minor roads—quiet, country roads—50%
*cyclepaths/off-road—disused railway lines, etc.—46%

The C2C is best ridden from west to east to take advantage of the prevailing winds from the west and the more favourable gradients. Tradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the Irish Sea and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the North Sea at the finish.

The floods of December 2015 destroyed or damaged some bridges on the C2C route through Cumbria, and there is quite often forestry work which closes some off-road sections, but alternative routes are signposted and are generally shown on the C2C-cycle website.

It is typically completed in 3–5 days, though it has been completed in a single day (the record is currently held by Joel Toombs and Matt Shorrock at 7 hours 53 minutes and 03 seconds west to east on 28 September 2012). The youngest person to complete the C2C in one day is Christian Webster-Reed, aged 15, who completed the C2C in a moving time of 8:56:04 and an overall time of 13:56:24 on 25 August 2013.

The youngest person to complete the C2C2C in one day, from Tynemouth to Silloth and then back to Tynemouth again, is Hal Kennedy aged 17; completing the route in a moving time of 11:27:15 and an overall time of 14:28:02 on 8 May 2022.

In September 2021, Johan Lempen and Harvey Logan became the first people to complete the route on children&#x27;s scooters.

The route links to other parts of the NCN so can be used as part of a longer cycle tour.

Route maps for the C2C and detailed route guides from other publishers are available from Sustrans.

<text>835 Naval Air Squadron was a former squadron of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm originally formed in February 1942 as a torpedo bomber and reconnaissance unit flying Fairey Swordfish. In June 1943, six Sea Hurricanes were added to the squadron as a fighter flight. The composite unit exchanged the Hurricanes in September 1944 for Grumman Wildcats, serving on until 1 April 1945, when the squadron disbanded.

==History==
===1942===
The first members of the squadron assembled at the Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Eastleigh (also known as HMS Raven) in January 1942 near Southampton in Hampshire. They left Eastleigh on 29 January to board the SS &quot;Andalucia Star&quot; at Glasgow. &quot;Andalucia Star&quot; sailed from Glasgow on 4 February and arrived in Kingston, Jamaica on 17 February. 835 Naval Air Squadron officially formed that day at Palisadoes (HMS Buzzard), Jamaica as a torpedo-bomber and reconnaissance squadron of Fairey Swordfish. After patrolling the seas around Jamaica until 12 March 1942, the squadron moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where a refitted lay waiting to take them aboard. &quot;Furious&quot; left Norfolk on 3 April 1942, and arrived at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus), Hampshire, on 15 April. The squadron moved to RNAS Hatston (HMS Sparrowhawk), Orkney, Scotland, in June 1942. During a period of frequent relocation the squadron moved to RNAS Stretton (HMS Blackcap), Cheshire, on 22 September 1942 and to RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail), Argyll, on 29 October to spend November doing initial Deck Launch Training (DLT) on . December saw temporary return to RNAS Machrihanish before relocation to RAF Kirkistown, County Down, Northern Ireland.

===1943===
Return to RNAS Machrihanish on 29 January 1943 caused the base to be nicknamed &quot;Clapham Junction&quot; by the squadron. Carrier embarkation was aboard on 8 April 1943 for convoy duties, but the squadron returned to RNAS Machrihanish for RP-3 Rocket Projectile training on 7 May. After a short return to &quot;Battler&quot;, the squadron moved to RAF Ballykelly, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland on 15 May and to RNAS Eglington (HMS Gannet) on 22 May. In June 1943, 835 Squadron was reinforced with a flight of six Sea Hurricane Mk.IIcs from 804 squadron. The Hurricanes spent part of September and October 1943 operating from , while some of the Swordfishes served aboard and the others remained at RAF Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland. After a period ashore at RNAS Eglington, the squadron shortly embarked on for three weeks before transfer to RNAS Abbotsinch (HMS Sanderling) and thence to RNAS Eglington.

===1944===
The squadron transferred to the escort carrier on 31 December 1943, and returned ashore at RNAS Hatston and RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail) in January 1944. Most of 1944, however, was spent onboard &quot;Nairana&quot;, on Atlantic convoy duties and on the Gibraltar Run. The squadron also served in 1944 with a successful submarine Hunter-Killer Group in the North Atlantic under the overall command of Captain Frederick Walker. Three Ju 290s were shot down in May and June. The squadron became involved in the Murmansk Convoys to and from RNAS Hatston in August. Squadron pilots faced the most dangerous flying conditions of the war to attack two U-boats and shoot down four enemy aircraft in the Arctic. The aging Sea Hurricanes were replaced by Grumman Wildcat Mk.VIs in September.

===1945===
The squadron of 14 Swordfish and six Grumman Wildcats was led by Lieutenant-Commander Val Jones, a Swordfish Observer. The Senior Pilot of the squadron was Lieutenant Allen Burgham, DSC, MiD, who flew Sea Hurricane Mk.IIcs and later Wildcat Mk.VIs, and was Flight Commander of the Fighter Component. Lt-Commander John Godley RNVR, who had previously been in command of &#x27;P&#x27; Flight of 836 Naval Air Squadron, became commander of the squadron on 9 January 1945.

Lieutenant-Commander Godley served as Squadron Commanding Officer for one Murmansk Convoy in February 1945. 835 Squadron saw further combat doing two coastal anti-shipping raids along the Norwegian coast off Trondheim, before being disbanded on 1 April 1945 at RNAS Hatston, with its fighter flight transferring to 821 Naval Air Squadron. Lieutenant-Commander Godley was transferred to command 714 Naval Air Squadron.

<text>The SBB RABDe 500, also known as the ICN, is a Swiss high speed passenger EMU, which was introduced in 2000, in time for Expo.02 held in western Switzerland in 2002. Its maximum speed is , and it employs tilting technology, which allows it to travel through curvy routes faster than non-tilting trains. The train sets were a joint development by Bombardier, Swiss Federal Railways and Alstom, with an aerodynamic body designed by Pininfarina, bogies and tilting mechanism designed by the then SIG, Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft.

Forty-four RABDe 500 trains with a total of 308 coaches were delivered to SBB-CFF-FFS between 1999 and 2005. The RABDe 500 often run with two complete compositions, each with seven carriages and a seating capacity of 480, both including a dining car. The outer four of the seven carriages are second class.

==History==
Swiss Federal Railways ordered an initial 24 7-car trainsets in 1996 at a cost of . The contract went to a consortium including Adtranz, , and Fiat-SIG. Pininfarina designed the vehicle body. The trains were intended for use on the Jura Foot Line; adopting tilting technology allowed SBB to defer track upgrades over the route.

The first trainsets entered service on the 28 May 2000 timetable change, running from St. Gallen via Winterthur, Zürich and Biel/Bienne to Lausanne. All 24 trainsets were in service by the opening of the Expo.02 national exposition in May 2002. The trains all carried the slogan &quot;enable the future&quot; ().

SBB ordered another 10 trainsets, with an option for 10 more, in June 2001. SBB exercised the option that December, for a total of 20 additional transets at . Delivery was complete by 2005.

Formerly, SBB designated intercity services operated by the SBB RABDe 500 as &quot;ICN&quot;, differentiating them from other InterCity (IC) and InterRegio (IR) services. This practice ceased with the December 2017 timetable changes, in which all IC and IR services gained numbers and the ICN category was eliminated. RABDe 500-operated services are indicated on timetables and mobile applications by the &quot;&quot; label.

All 44 trainsets were refurbished between 2012 and 2019, an overhaul taking 25 days per train. Another overhaul, taking place between 2021 and 2029, will replace the interiors and improve mobile phone reception.

 the RABDe 500 is primarily used on two InterCity routes and one InterRegio route: the IC 5, running from to or Zürich HB; the IC 51, running from to ; and the IR 57 running from to .

==Design==
Each formation is composed of seven cars. The first two and last two cars in the trainset are the second class cars, and have the traction motors and powered axles. The three middle cars carry first class seating; the third car is split between first class and the restaurant car. The formation is long and weighs . The car body is a monocoque design built out of aluminium.

The RABDe 500 can tilt at a maximum of 8 degrees. Eight traction motors produce ; the train can travel at a maximum speed of . On routes with a significant number of curves, the tilting technology could reduce travel times by 10–20%. For example, on the – route, the introduction of the trains shortened travel times by 15 minutes.

In 2015–2016, eighteen trainsets were adapted for operation in the Gotthard Base Tunnel. Changes included improved fire detection equipment, cab signaling upgrades, and improvements to heating and cooling. This was a temporary measure until newer non-tilting trains SBB RABe 501 (&quot;Giruno&quot;) trains became available.

==Naming==
All forty-four RABDe 500 trains are named, mostly after famous Swiss scholars, artists, writers, politicians, engineers, and architects. Each train bears the portrait of its namesake, painted by Bernese painter Martin Fivian, in the third car (first class and restaurant).

<text>Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm is an autosomal dominant disorder of large arteries.

There is an association between familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and Marfan syndrome as well as other hereditary connective tissue disorders.

==Signs and symptoms==
A degenerative breakdown of collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle caused by aging contributes to weakening of the wall of the artery.

In the aorta, this can result in the formation of a fusiform aneurysm. There is also increased risk of aortic dissection.

==Genetics==
Types include:
==Diagnosis==

==Treatment==
==Terminology==
It is sometimes called &quot;Erdheim cystic medial necrosis of aorta&quot;, after Jakob Erdheim.

The term &quot;cystic medial degeneration&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;cystic medial necrosis&quot;, because necrosis is not always found.

<text>The IC 2000 is a double-deck push-pull train in Switzerland and is run by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) as part of its InterCity service. Top speed is 200 km/h. The train set can be composed of up to 10 coaches and provides close to 1,000 seats, according to SBB. In 1997-2004, the consortium, made up of Schindler Waggon, Pratteln (later Bombardier Transportation Switzerland) and Alstom delivered 341 coaches to SBB, of which about 320 coaches are still in use as of December 2009.

==Overview==

IC 2000 was the first double-deck train in use on a nationwide scale. Previously, most, if not all, double-deck trains, belonged to the Zürich S-Bahn network.
The IC 2000 typically has a dining or a bistro car, and a snacks trolley service on the upper level throughout the train set. Both the first and second class coaches feature luggage racks on both decks; in addition, small suitcases can be stored under the seats. In November 2013, the first Starbucks café coaches on SBB-CFF-FFS were launched using two refurbished IC 2000 dining cars, used on a 9-month trial basis on the St. Gallen – Geneva route.

The driving trailer at the beginning or at the end of the train is either a family coach with a special play area on the upper level or has a family zone, also on the upper level. In either case, there is space on the lower deck of the driving trailer for pushchairs, bicycles, and skis. Trains with family coaches are marked FA in the timetables.

75 first class coaches are equipped with power sockets for charging laptops etc. Trains with such business zones are marked BZ in the timetables and the coaches themselves can be identified by a laptop icon. On certain routes, passengers are able to use mobile broadband internet access for an additional fee. The business zone coaches can be typically found behind the locomotive.

The usage of the IC 2000 is now very commonplace in Switzerland. Its &quot;cowlike&quot; black-and-white design, and red doors, make it instantly recognisable. The train exterior was designed by Pininfarina, to match the style of the Re 460 locomotive used with the trainset.

Due to the frequent use of mobile phones, in December 2008, SBB introduced &quot;quiet zones&quot; in both classes, where &quot;conversation and discussion, even if conducted quietly; listening to music or the radio, even using headphones; using audio and video applications on laptops; and using mobile phones&quot; are prohibited. However, after one year quiet zones have been restricted to some first class coaches only.

== IC 2020 Project ==

In December 2016, Swiss Federal Railways initiated its largest train refurbishment project to date. The entire IC 2000 fleet (a total of 341 coaches) will be refurbished by the end of 2024 at SBB&#x27;s Olten facility. The refurbished coaches are expected to operate until 2043, combined with refurbished Re 460 locomotives that are being rebuilt in SBB&#x27;s Yverdon-les-Bains facility. After the renovation, the coaches will be rebranded as IC 2020. The refreshed livery has a different appearance compared to the original fleet: the coaches are white, with black bands across the window sections and undercarriage. A red stripe runs above the upper deck, and then covers the front section of the driving car. The refurbished coaches also have a new interior design. In contrast to dark tones of the original design, the refurbished interior has brighter tones and materials. 40 first class coaches will include conference tables for business meetings, replacing standard 4/2 person compartments.

<text>:&quot;There are other meanings for Amaya.&quot;


Amaya is a village (pop. 67 ()) located in the municipality of Sotresgudo, Burgos, in the region of Castile-Leon, Spain.

The name of the village has Indo-European roots and means &quot;am (ma)&quot; or &quot;mother&quot;. The suffix io-ia is also used to form action names or toponyms, implying that the meaning of Amaya or Amaia is &quot;mother city&quot;, as it will be called later &quot;the capital&quot;. An alternative hypothesis states that the name derives from the Proto-Basque or Basque word &quot;Amaia&quot;, meaning &quot;the end&quot;.

Amaya was one of the main villages of the Cantabri Celtic tribes, and played a key role in the Cantabrian wars during the Roman conquest of Hispania, and later, during the Visigothic Kingdom, as the capital of the Duchy of Cantabria.

Amaya is mentioned in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of John of Biclaro, as a town captured by the Visigothic king Liuvigild in 574.

According to the Muslim chroniclers, in the year 714, Musa ibn Nusair sacked Amaya for the second time after Tariq did the year before. Peter, the provincial &quot;dux&quot;, led his people into refuge in the mountains, and after the local noble Pelayo of Asturias in the neighbor region of Asturias started a rebellion against the Berber garrison, Dux Peter as other western Galician nobles supported the election of him as new King or &quot;Princeps&quot; in the lead against the common enemy.

In the first stages of the Reconquista, the city was part of the repopulating efforts of the Kingdom of Asturias in the border region of Bardulia, the primitive territories of Castile. After the campaigns of Alfonso I of Asturias (739-757) against the Moors, the city lay an abandoned in the largely empty buffer zone between Moors and Christians known at the time as &quot;The Desert of the Duero&quot; and was part of the repopulation campaign carried out a century later, during the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850-866).

At that time it was an important and significant place, as a very old saying states: &quot;Harto era Castilla pequeño rincón, cuando Amaya era la cabeza y Montes de Oca el mojón&quot; (A very small corner was Castile, when Amaya was the head and Montes de Oca the boundary stone).

Amaya was historically a short-lived bishopric, which is no longer an active residential diocese. Presently, the Catholic Church recognizes Amaya as a titular see, which means it holds symbolic significance within the Church hierarchy.

<text>ChapStick is a brand name of lip balm owned by Suave Brands Company and is used in many countries worldwide. It is intended to help treat and prevent chapped lips, hence the name. Many varieties also include sunscreen to avoid sunburn.

Due to its popularity, the term has become a genericized trademark. It popularly refers to any lip balm contained in a lipstick-style tube and applied in the same manner as lipstick. However, the term is still a registered trademark, with rights exclusively owned by Suave Brands Company.

ChapStick generated $142million in revenue in 2023.

== History ==

In the early 1880s, Charles Browne Fleet, a physician and pharmacological thinker from Lynchburg, Virginia, invented ChapStick as a lip balm product. The handmade product, which resembled a wickless candle wrapped in tin foil, was sold locally and did not have much success.

In 1912, John Morton, also a Lynchburg resident, bought the rights to the product for five dollars. Mrs. Morton melted the pink ChapStick mixture in their kitchen, cooled it, and cut it into sticks. Their lucrative sales were used to found the Morton Manufacturing Corporation.

In 1935, Frank Wright, Jr., a commercial artist from Lynchburg, Virginia, was commissioned to design the CHET ChapStick logo that is still used today. He was paid a one-time fee of $15.

In 1963, The A.H. Robins Company acquired ChapStick from Morton Manufacturing Corporation. At that time, only the ChapStick Lip Balm regular stick was being marketed to consumers; subsequently, many more varieties were introduced. This includes ChapStick four-flavored sticks in 1971, ChapStick Sunblock 15 in 1981, ChapStick Petroleum Jelly Plus in 1985, and ChapStick Medicated in 1992.

Robins was purchased by American Home Products (AHP) in 1988. AHP later changed its name to Wyeth. ChapStick was a Wyeth product until 2009 when Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer. Pfizer sold the manufacturing facility in Richmond, Virginia, on October 3, 2011, to Fareva Richmond, which now manufactures and packages ChapStick for Pfizer.

In 2019, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare acquired ChapStick from Pfizer. In July 2022, GlaxoSmithKline spun off its consumer brands, including ChapStick, into a new consumer health company named Haleon.

In January 2024, it was announced that Suave Brands Co. (SBC) would acquire the brand from Haleon for $510 million. SBC had been formed a year earlier by Yellow Wood Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm, to purchase the North American rights to the Suave brand previously owned by Unilever.

In June 2024, it was reported that SBC had completed the purchase of the brand in a deal valued at approximately $430 million.

== Composition ==
Ingredients commonly include camphor, beeswax, menthol, petrolatum, phenol, vitamin E, aloe and oxybenzone. However, there are many variants of ChapStick, each with its composition. Due to safety concerns, phenol is banned from use in cosmetic products in the European Union and Canada.

The full list of ingredients in a regular-flavored ChapStick is:

arachidyl propionate, camphor, carnauba wax, cetyl alcohol, D&amp;C red no. 6 barium lake, FD&amp;C yellow no. 5 aluminum lake, fragrance, isopropyl lanolate, isopropyl myristate, lanolin, light mineral oil, methylparaben, octyldodecanol, oleyl alcohol, paraffin, phenyl trimethicone, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, white wax, propanol. Its net weight is usually .

When manufactured by Wyeth, Chapstick contained no parabens.

==Uses==

ChapStick functions as both a sunscreen, available with SPFs as high as 50, and a skin lubricant to help prevent and protect chafed, chapped, sunburned, cracked, and windburned lips. &quot;Medicated&quot; varieties also contain analgesics to relieve sore lips. In addition to medical uses, ChapStick has had other uses; the lubricating properties have been useful on precision instruments such as slide rules. Other lubricants, while appropriate to the instruments, might have been harmful to the skin, while ChapStick is not.

== Marketing ==
ChapStick is sometimes available in special flavors developed in connection with marketing partners such as Disney (as in cross-promotions with &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; or the movie &quot;Cars&quot;) or with charitable causes such as breast cancer awareness, in which 30¢ is donated for each stick sold (as in the Susan G. Komen Pink Pack). The Flava-Craze line is marketed to preteens and young teens, with colorful applicators and &quot;fun&quot; flavors such as Grape Craze and Blue Crazeberry.

US Olympic skier Suzy Chaffee starred in ChapStick television commercials in which she dubbed herself &quot;Suzy ChapStick&quot;. Another very famous ChapStick advertisement includes basketball legend Julius Erving (commonly known as Dr. J) naming himself Dr. ChapStick and telling young children about the great things that ChapStick can do.

Diana Golden, a U.S. Olympic gold medal-winning skier and 1988, Ski Racing Magazine and United States Olympic Committee female skier of the year, was also a spokesperson for ChapStick. Former ski racer Picabo Street, for a time, was seen on television commercials as one of the company&#x27;s endorsers.

Its main competitors in the United States—Carmex and Blistex—also use the popular lipstick-style tube for their lip balm products. In Iceland and in the United Kingdom, the product&#x27;s main competitor is Lypsyl, made by Novartis Consumer Health and distributed in similar packaging to ChapStick.

<text>The Forch railway (, &quot;FB&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Förchler&quot;, &quot;Frieda&quot;, &quot;Frieda Bünzli&quot; by locals) is a local mixed tramway / railway line in the Swiss canton of Zürich. It is owned and operated by the Forchbahn AG, and is branded as line S18 of the Zürich S-Bahn. The standard Zürcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) zonal fare tariffs apply to the line.

The line opened in 1912 and links the towns of Esslingen and Forch to Rehalp, an outer suburb of the city of Zürich. From Rehalp, trains continue over the Zürich tram system to a terminus at , outside the Zürich Stadelhofen railway station in central Zürich.

The line is built to metre gauge ( gauge). Between Esslingen and Rehalp the line has a length of some , with the continuation over the Zürich tram system adding an extra of route.

== History ==

The Forch railway line opened on November 27, 1912, with the trip taking 67 minutes. As built, the line from the Zürich city boundary to Esslingen was a single track tramway, largely mixed in with road traffic. At Esslingen, the Forch line connected with the Uster-Oetwil line and, indirectly via that, with the Wetzikon-Meilen line. These two metre gauge tramway lines had both closed by 1950.

In 1950 it was proposed that the line should be replaced by buses, and a two-week test bus operation was undertaken with moderate success. The conclusion of the experiment was that retaining the line was the best solution provided that the line could be separated from the street and modernized. In the following decade, separation of rail and road traffic was increased. New bogie rolling stock was acquired, similar to two cars built for the line in the late 1940s.

In 1970, a new depot and station was built at Forch, together with a new section of line and underpass under the new main road. Between 1973 and 1976 a tunnel was built under the village of Zumikon, eliminating the street section through that village. In 1976, new Tram 2000 trains were introduced and a regular 15-minute train frequency was introduced. By 1979 the line had been doubled as far as Neue Forch.

Projected extensions to Zürich Hauptbahnhof and Wetzikon were under consideration as early as 1979, but have yet to become reality. In 1990, the line was added to the ZVV transportation network, and in 1995 a new terminus was built at Esslingen. In 2004, new low floor cars were acquired from Stadler to replace the 1950s stock. In 2007, the terminus at Stadelhofen was realigned.

== Operation ==

=== Route ===
The line starts from at Stadelhoferplatz, outside the main line Stadelhofen station, where the line terminates on a loop with its own two platforms. The Forchbahn platforms are flanked by platforms for tram routes 11 and 8 of the Zürich tram system, which share tracks with the initial stretch of the Forchbahn.

Between Stadelhofen and Rehalp, the Forchbahn trains use the tracks of the tram system, owned by the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ), which are electrified at 600 V DC and are largely situated in the street. Between these two points, Forchbahn trains serve intermediate tram stops at Kreuzplatz (where tram route 8 diverges), Hegibachplatz and Balgrist.

At Rehalp tram route 11 has its terminus, and the Forchbahn trains enter the line&#x27;s separate Rehalp station. Here they join the Forchbahn proper, which is electrified on the overhead system at 1200 V DC. From Rehalp to the Waltikon station the line uses a roadside double track alignment, and serves the intermediate stations of Waldburg, Spital Zollikerberg and Zollikerberg.

Immediately after leaving Waltikon station, the line enters a double track tunnel under the village of Zumikon, serving the underground stations of Zumikon and Maiacher. The line surfaces just before entering Neue Forch station, where it resumes its roadside alignment. The next section of line, between Neue Forch and Forch, is single track, to be double tracked in the 2020s. The line&#x27;s headquarters is situated at the 1970s Forch station, which includes a depot complex.

After Forch the line passes under the motor way built 1970 before returning to its alignment alongside the old road. The remainder of the line is single track, and serves intermediate stations at Scheuren, Neuhaus bei Hinteregg, Hinteregg, Egg, Langwies and Emmat. All these stops include passing loops, with the exception of Langwies and Emmat. The line terminates at the modern Esslingen station, which has three tracks and an overall roof.

=== Services ===

The passenger services on the line forms part of the Zürich S-Bahn, branded as the S18. The standard Zürcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) zonal fare tariffs apply to the line.

During the day, trains calling at all stops run every 15 minutes from Stadelhofen to Forch, with every second train continuing to Esslingen. At peak periods, four express trains per hour run to Esslingen without stopping between Rehalp and Forch, whilst another four trains per hour provide a stopping service as far as Forch. Stopping trains take about 35 minutes to cover the full journey, with express trains some 5 minutes faster.

=== Rolling stock ===
The line uses the following rolling stock:
Trailer car, B 119 originally built 1930 for Lausanne Tramways, was preserved in the Zürich Tram Museum from 2007 until 2021. 
In spring 2021 it was regauged for and is used for heritage trains on the Agnita railway line in Romania.
After the 1950/60 stock was rendered surplus by the new Stadler cars, the Forchbahn motor cars BDe 4/4 11 to 16, and driving trailers Bt 101 to 108 (less the scrapped Bt 107) were donated to the municipality of Antananarivo in Madagascar. The vehicles were shipped to Madagascar in 2004/5, for use in creating a suburban train service, but by 2021 they were still in store there.
In 2021, according to a news item in the madegassian paper «La Vérité», using the trailer cars for a &quot;jungle express&quot; in the south east of the island was proposed.

<text>Amaya o los vascos en el siglo VIII (&quot;Amaya, or the Basques in the 8th century&quot;) is a Romantic historical novel published in 1877 (in the magazine &quot;Ciencia cristiana&quot;) and in 1879 (as a book) by Francisco Navarro-Villoslada, a noted novel by a Navarrese author. The story is placed during the invasion of Visigothic Kingdom by the Moors. In line with the author&#x27;s conspiracist imaginary, the story-building is permeated by anti-Semitic prejudice.

==Plot summary==

Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading Muslims.

Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a Jew conspiring in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio&#x27;s son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow.

At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity; the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.
The legends of Teodosio de Goñi and San Miguel de Aralar, the Caba Rumía, the Table of Solomon in Toledo, and others are also mentioned in the plot.

==Influences==
The novel is influenced by the works of Walter Scott
 and the Catholic movement Carlism presenting the Navarrese as the defenders of Spanish monarchy and Christianity. The myth of Aitor as an ancestral Basque patriarch comes from Joseph-Augustine Chaho.

The young Miguel de Unamuno was impressed after reading &quot;Amaya&quot; and Arturo Campión&#x27;s &quot;Blancos y negros&quot;. 
Domingo de Aguirre decided to produce a similar work in Biscayan Basque and published &quot;Auñamendiko lorea&quot; (&quot;The flower of the Pyrenees&quot;)

&quot;Amaia&quot; and &quot;Amagoia&quot; (in modern spelling) are used today as Basque female names.
&quot;Asier&quot; is used today as a Basque male name.

Jesús Guridi&#x27;s opera &quot;Amaya&quot; (inspired by the novel) debuted at the Coliseo Albia of Bilbao in 1920.

A film version appeared in 1952.

<text>The Bonnechere River is a river in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in Nipissing District and Renfrew County in eastern and northeastern Ontario, Canada. The river flows from Algonquin Provincial Park to the Ottawa River east and north of the town of Renfrew. The river&#x27;s name is thought to come from the French words bonne, meaning good, fair, pretty, or serving girl, and chère, meaning dear, fond, loving, or darling. Because of the variety of possible meanings these words hold, a direct translation of meaning is not very possible.

==Geography==
The Bonnechere River begins in Algonquin Provincial Park at McKaskill Lake in geographic Clancy Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It heads north into geographic Niven Township, then loops back southeast into Clancy Township, under a Hydro One transmission corridor and into geographic Guthrie Township. It continues southeast through the Crooked Chute, over the High Falls, through the Stacks Rapids to the unincorporated place Basin Depot, located on a former logging road.

The river continues southeast out of the park at Boundary access point (Access point Q), enters geographic Burns Township in Madawaska Valley, Renfrew County, then heads into geographic Richards Township in Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards, Renfrew County, takes in the left tributary Pine River, passes through the Jack Chute Rapids, and reaches Round Lake, where it takes in the right tributary Sherwood River. The rivers leaves the lake at Grassy Bay controlled by the Round Lake Dam and reaches Golden Lake in North Algona Wilberforce, where it is crossed by Ontario Highway 60. The lake is home to Killaloe at the west and the Algonquins of Pikwàkanagàn First Nation at the southeast.

From Golden Lake until the river reaches Admaston/Bromley downstream, the river forms the boundary between North Algona Wilberforce (left bank, on the north) and Bonnechere Valley (right bank, on the south). The Bonnechere River leaves Golden Lake controlled by the Golden Lake Dam.

The river reaches its mouth at Lac des Chats on the Ottawa River near the settlement of Fergusons Beach.

The river is long and drains an area of .

===The Chutes===
There are five chutes along the Bonnechere River. The First Chute of the river is where the Bonnechere empties into the Ottawa River, at Castleford. The Second Chute is in Renfrew; this waterfall has a small hydroelectric dam. The Third Chute is in Douglas, which also has a small hydroelectric dam. The Fourth Chute is in the small village of Fourth Chute, and the Fifth Chute is in Eganville. The chutes used were for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls.

==Economy==
During the 19th century, the river was used to transport white pine logs from the forested areas surrounding the river. Throughout the 20th century, the Bonnechere River became increasingly recognized for its hydroelectric potential. Currently, Renewable Power Generation (RPG) utilizes the river&#x27;s water to turn turbines and produce electricity, which is then sold to the Province of Ontario under contract.

==Natural history==

The Bonnechère Caves, formed from ancient limestone, are located by the river near the village of Eganville, Ontario, in the hamlet of Fourth Chute, Ontario.

There are two provincial parks along its length: the Bonnechere River Provincial Park (a 23 km long section bordering Algonquin Park) and the Bonnechere Provincial Park (located on Round Lake).

The Bonnechere River lies mostly in a 175 million-year-old rift valley called the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben.

Over the years, songs have been written about the Bonnechere River including the recent &quot;In The Arms Of The Bonnechere River&quot; by Ottawa Valley singer/songwriter, Terry McLeish.

== River run ==
Each year the river is host to a raft run between the third and fourth chute. Originally arranged by local Shriners, the run has taken on a less official status, occurring with little to no organization apart from its pre-determined date during Victoria Day weekend. Participants design and build a raft or anything else they hope will take them down the river. The river presents natural obstacles in the form of light rapids. There is no competitive angle to the run with no prize at the end other than warmth and a good time. Most participants are young adults from the area returning to visit friends and family. Having recently surpassed its twenty-fourth year, the river run is a local tradition.

<doc id="987782" wikidata="Q621055" url="?curid=987782" title="InterRegio">
<text>The InterRegio, often shortened to IR, is a train category for mainly domestic train services in use in some European countries, with Swiss Federal Railways operating the most dense network. InterRegio trains are semi-fast long-distance trains with more stops and usually lower prices than more upscale long-distance trains such as the InterCity (IC).

==Denmark==
The InterRegio system was also introduced to the Danish railways in the early 1990s and became an alternative to the InterCity services, with no seat reservation required. However, unlike other countries, InterRegio trains in Denmark only operates on Fridays and Sundays, to support the heavy flow of passengers that travel on those days. These InterRegio services also have fewer stops than the InterCity services, which goes against the original InterRegio concept of long-distance trains with more local stops. There are no specific rules for the composition for these trains, and both old and new material has been used for InterRegio services.

==Hungary==
The InterRégió trains were introduced in Hungary on . InterRégió trains run mainly on regional lines, but their function is national as well. The trains operate along the lines Sárbogárd–Szekszárd–Baja and Kecskemét–Baja–Dombóvár. InterRégió trains use air-conditioned MÁV 6341 DMU-s which were built by the Russian Metrovagonmash.

==Poland==
In Poland, interREGIO trains were introduced by Przewozy Regionalne (PR) in spring of , the first IR train connecting Białystok with Warsaw. The fare is similar as &quot;TLK&quot;-branded fast trains of PKP Intercity.

In the beginning these trains operated mostly on Fridays and Sundays along the routes: Wrocław-Kraków, Kraków-Przemyśl, Poznań-Olsztyn, Poznań-Warsaw and Bydgoszcz-Warsaw. Since June 2009 there are more interREGIO trains on routes; most of them are available through the whole week, some of them only on weekends. More routes were introduced, some of which are especially made for students, like Kielce-Częstochowa-Wrocław.

InterREGIO in Poland mostly uses older electric multiple units (usually ED72, EN71 and EN57), with newer units on some routes (ED73 and ED59 between Warsaw and Łódź, 14WE between Kraków and Warsaw). Some IR trains are serviced with single- and/or double-decker cars and locomotives.

, all IR trains in Poland are second class-only, even though PR&#x27;s regulations include a first-class fare for interREGIO trains and in service are first-class coaches, yet declassified.

On 3 March 2012, the Szczekociny train collision occurred, with 15 deaths and 50 injured.

Since 1 September 2015 IR trains are only on routes Łódź – Warszawa and Ełk – Grodno (Belarus), due to company&#x27;s economics and restructuring. The rest were withdrawn or replaced by &quot;Twoje Linie Kolejowe&quot; express trains.

== Portugal ==
Portugal&#x27;s national railway company Comboios de Portugal (CP) operates some Interregionais, which before 2001 were known as &quot;Directos&quot; or &quot;Semi-Directos&quot;. These trains offer a faster option than regional trains but slower than intercity trains. They operate along the lines Porto-Régua-Pocinho, Figueira da Foz-Porto-Valença, Porto-Coimbra, Lisboa-Tomar, Lisboa-Caldas da Rainha and Caldas da Rainha-Coimbra. The Interregional service is operated by CP Regional using CP 2240 EMU-s, Spanish rented CP 592 DMU-s and locomotives CP 2600 with Arco coaches bought to Renfe in 2020 and refurbished by Comboios de Portugal.

==Switzerland==


The InterRegio in Switzerland was first introduced in . They replaced some of the former fast trains with their own identity. InterRegio trains run from region to region within Switzerland. One service extends to the German city of Konstanz, just across the border.

InterRegio trains are now very commonplace in Switzerland. The abbreviation is IR in a 45°-edgy font, white letters on red (). Since the early 2020s, most IR services are numbered and each has a distinct colour.

The ICN runs as an InterCity (IC) train but sometimes with halt frequencies in the same manner as an IR (Geneva/Lausanne-St. Gallen/Basel route). When ICN services first began on 28 May 2000, the ICN was placed as an InterRegio train. , SBB Re 460-hauled IC 2000 cars and RABe 511 or RABe 502 EMUs operate as IR services on several routes, while some routes are operated by SOB RABe 526, BLS RABe 528 or other.

 the following InterRegio services exist, operated by SBB CFF FFS, BLS, RhB and SOB:

==Countries with defunct InterRegio services==
===Belgium===
In Belgium, InterRegio (IR) trains were slower than the fast IC trains, and usually called at more stations along a route. Their journey was usually not as long as IC trains, but still traveled further than the local (L) trains. Most IR trains had hourly frequencies, some having only services every two hours (although this is mostly true only for weekend services). All trains in Belgium shared the same cost structure, so taking an IR train cost the same as an IC or L train for the same route. The only difference lay in the number of station stops they called at. In December 2014 the InterRegio was withdrawn, InterRegio lines were either converted to InterCity or local train or cancelled completely.

===Germany===

InterRegio trains were also commonplace in Germany from 1988 to 2003. They travelled and mainly connected regions in Germany. Most of the InterRegio lines have been replaced by InterCity lines; a few were replaced by the newly established Interregio-Express (IRE) type. However, Interregio-Express lines belong technically to the short distance train category, and tend to be shorter. InterRegio trains were very popular as they could be used without supplement.

DB gradually retired the concept in favor of more expensive InterCity (IC) or Intercity Express (ICE) trains with several former IR lines also being split up and downgraded to regional services.

===Italy===
The &quot;Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane&quot; introduced interregional trains () in 1993, with express trains and some direct trains classified under this category. The name was abandoned in 2006 and the services subsequently operated as either CityExpress (CExp) or regional trains (R/REG). Since 2010, the former interregional trains received the new category (RV/RGV), .

==Countries with planned InterRegio services==
===Austria===
Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) intends to introduce the InterRegio category for long-distance services on routes that are currently only served by regional trains and routes currently served by long-distance trains only. The introduction of this scheduled for December 2025.

<text>Christiaan Frederick Beyers Naudé (10 May 1915 – 7 September 2004) was a South African Afrikaner Calvinist Dominee, theologian and the leading Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist. He was known simply as Beyers Naudé, or more colloquially, &quot;Oom Bey&quot; (Afrikaans for &quot;Uncle Bey&quot;).

==Early life and education==
One of eight children, Beyers Naudé was born to Jozua François Naudé and Adriana Johanna Naudé (née) van Huyssteen in Roodepoort, Transvaal (now Gauteng). The progenitor of the Naudé name was a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Naudé who arrived in the Cape in 1718. The Naudé surname is one of numerous French surnames that retained their original spelling in South Africa. Beyers Naudé was named after General Christiaan Frederick Beyers, under whom his father had served as a soldier and unofficial military chaplain during the second Anglo-Boer War.

Jozua Naudé, an Afrikaner Calvinist minister,or &quot;Dominee&quot;, &quot;was convinced that the British would never leave.&quot; He helped to found the &quot;Broederbond&quot; (Afrikaans, &quot;Brotherhood&quot; or &quot;League of Brothers&quot;), the powerful Afrikaner Calvinist men&#x27;s secret society that played a dominant role in South Africa under apartheid. The &quot;Broederbond&quot; became especially synonymous with the Afrikaner-dominated National Party that won power in 1948 and implemented the racial segregation policy of apartheid. The elder Naudé also helped produce the earliest translations of the Bible into the newly standardized language of Afrikaans.

In 1921, the Naudé family moved to the Cape Province town of Graaff-Reinet, in the Karoo region. Beyers Naudé attended Afrikaans Hoërskool [Afrikaans High School], matriculating in 1931. Naudé studied theology at the University of Stellenbosch and lived at Wilgenhof men&#x27;s residence. He graduated in 1939 with an MA in languages and a theology degree. His sociology lecturer was the future prime minister and chief-architect of apartheid, H. F. Verwoerd. But Naudé credited Stellenbosch theologian Ben Keet with laying the groundwork for his own theological dissent.

Naudé was ordained in 1939 as a minister in the South African Dutch Reformed Church and joined the &quot;Broederbond&quot; as its youngest member. For 20 years he served various congregations, starting at Wellington in Western Cape Province (1940–1942), Loxton (1942–1945), Pretoria - South-Olifantsfontein (1945–1949), Pretoria East (1945–1954), Potchefstroom (1954–1959) and Aasvoëlkop (Johannesburg) (1959–1963) preaching a religious justification for apartheid. On 3 August 1940 Naudé married Ilse Weder, whose father had been a Moravian missionary. The couple had three sons and a daughter.

== Anti-apartheid activities ==

The Sharpeville massacre in 1960 (during which the South African police killed 69 black demonstrators protesting against restrictions on their freedom of movement) ended his support for his church&#x27;s political teachings. He began to question the biblical justification of apartheid by the Dutch Reformed Church: &quot;I made an intensive study of the Bible to prove that those justifications were not valid. I concluded that the passages that were being used by the white DRC to justify apartheid were unfounded. In some cases, there was a deliberate distortion in order to prove the unprovable!&quot; In the three decades after his resignation from the denomination, Naudé&#x27;s vocal support for racial reconciliation and equal rights led to upheavals in the Dutch Reformed Church.

===Cottesloe and the Christian Institute of Southern Africa===
In response to Sharpeville, the World Council of Churches (WCC) sent a delegation to Johannesburg to meet with clerics. Naudé, by then the moderator of his church district (the Southern Transvaal Synod), helped to organize a consultation (the Cottesloe Consultation)
between the WCC and eighty South African church delegates in Cottesloe, a Johannesburg suburb. The Cottesloe Consultation&#x27;s resolutions rejected race as the basis of exclusion from churches, and affirmed the right of all people to own land and have a say in how they are governed. Naudé, alone among his church&#x27;s delegates, steadfastly continued to reject any theological basis for apartheid after Prime Minister Verwoerd forced the DRC delegation to repudiate the consultation. The Dutch Reformed Church later left the World Council of Churches.

In 1963 Naudé founded the Christian Institute of Southern Africa (CI), an ecumenical organization with the aim of fostering reconciliation through interracial dialogue, research, and publications. The DRC forced Naudé to choose between his status as minister and directorship of the CI. He then resigned his church post, left his Aasvoëlkop congregation in Northcliff, Johannesburg, and resigned from the &quot;Broederbond&quot; in 1963. As a result, he lost his status as minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. His last sermon to his congregation noted that &quot;We must show greater loyalty to God than to man&quot;. Stoically anticipating the enormous pressure by the Afrikaner political and church establishment that was to come, he told his wife: &quot;We must prepare for ten years in the wilderness.&quot; Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu later said &quot;Beyers became a leper in the Afrikaner community.&quot;

During the same year, Naudé was blamed for leaking secret, confidential, and unauthorized documents about the Broederbond to the press. The University of the Witwatersrand New Testament scholar Professor Albert S. Geyser later admitted that he had leaked the documents. Naudé had given the documents to Geyser to evaluate the extent of the influence of the Broederbond on the church. Geyser then provided the information to a journalist at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The book &quot;The Super-Afrikaners. Inside the Afrikaner Broederbond&quot;, written by Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom and published in 1978, exposed a name list of possible members of the Broederbond. The source of these documents, that was taken without authorization, was blamed on Naudé. In 1967 Naudé and Geyser won a libel case against conservative Pretoria Professor Adriaan Pont, who had called them communists.

In 1970 Naudé was among a few white South African Christian leaders &quot;who openly called for understanding of the WCC decision&quot; to provide financial support for liberation movements in southern Africa. &quot;If blood runs in the streets of South Africa it will not be because the World Council of Churches has done something but because the churches of South Africa have done nothing,&quot; Naudé said. In response, the state formed the Schlebusch Commission in 1972 to investigate anti-apartheid Christian organizations. When Naudé refused to testify, he was tried and imprisoned. After a night in the cells, a DRC minister paid his fine.

During a 1972 trip to Germany and Britain, Naudé preached at Westminster Abbey, &quot;the first Afrikaans theologian to be so honoured&quot;. In 1973 the state withdrew his passport, but temporarily returned it in 1974 so that he could travel to the University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana USA, to receive the Reinhold Niebuhr Award for justice and peace.

As the CI increasingly incorporated black African radicals like Steve Biko, Naudé had to bear the brunt of harassment by the state security police. The state eventually forced the CI to close in 1977.

=== Banning and the SACC ===

From 1977 to 1984 the South African government &quot;banned&quot; Naudé – a form of house arrest with severe restrictions on his movements and interactions. For example, he could not be in the same room with more than one other person. Other leaders of the Christian Institute suffered the same fate, including Brian Brown, Cedric Mayson, and Peter Randall. Although under constant police surveillance, Naudé managed to secretly help anti-apartheid resistors move around and out of South Africa by providing them with old vehicles that he had repaired himself. He later joked that this was &quot;My small contribution to a struggle I knew was right.&quot; His ANC liaison was Sydney Mufamadi, who became Minister of Provincial and Local Government in the post-apartheid government.

In 1980 Naudé and three other DRC theologians broke with the DRC and were accepted as clergy by the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, the black African denomination established by the white Dutch Reformed Church.

After his unbanning in 1985, he succeeded Archbishop Desmond Tutu as secretary general of the South African Council of Churches. In this role he called for the release of political prisoners (especially Nelson Mandela) and negotiation with the African National Congress. In 1987 the apartheid regime outlawed public pleas for the release of detainees. But Naudé pressed Christians to continue to publicly pray for detainees, despite government threats of imprisonment.

After his term at the South African Council of Churches ended, Naudé continued to serve a number of anti-apartheid and development organizations, including the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa, the Ecumenical Service for Socio-Economic Transformation, Kagiso Trust, and the Editorial Board of Challenge Magazine.

== Post-apartheid influence ==

After 1990 Naudé occasionally opened ANC events with scripture readings. That same year he was invited by the African National Congress to be the only Afrikaner member on their delegation in negotiations with the National Party government at Groote Schuur. Despite his long association with the African National Congress, Naudé never actually joined the party. Some have speculated that this, along with his advanced age and constant ill health during the last few years of his life, caused him to be politically sidelined. Others conclude that Naudé harbored a fierce independence and never sought personal advancement. Despite his association with the ANC, for instance, he also maintained ties with the black consciousness movement and the Pan Africanist Congress.

In 2000 he signed the Declaration of Commitment by White South Africans, a public document that acknowledged that apartheid had damaged black South Africans.

After his death at 89 on 7 September 2004, Nelson Mandela eulogized Naudé as &quot;a true humanitarian and a true son of Africa.&quot; Naudé&#x27;s official state funeral on Saturday 18 September 2004 was attended by President Thabo Mbeki, other dignitaries, and high-ranking ANC officials. Naudé&#x27;s ashes were scattered in the township of Alexandra, just outside Johannesburg. He was survived by his wife, four children, and two great-grandchildren.

Despite being persecuted by his own ethnic group, Naudé &quot;never outwardly expressed spite for his former opponents. &#x27;I am an Afrikaner,&#x27; he said. &#x27;I saw myself never as anything else but an Afrikaner, and I&#x27;m very grateful for the small contribution which I could have made.&#x27;&quot;

==Honors and accolades==

During his life Naudé received several honors, including the Bruno Kreisky Award for services to human rights (Austria, 1979), the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award (USA, 1984), the African American Institute Award (USA, 1985), Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award (USA, 1985) along with Allan Boesak and Winnie Mandela, the Swedish Labour Movement Award (Sweden, 1988), the Order of Oranje-Nassau (Netherlands, 1995), Order for Meritorious Service (Gold) (South Africa, 1997), and the Order of Merit (Germany, 1999).

Naudé received fourteen honorary doctorates during his lifetime and in 1993 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee.

==Legacy==
In 2001 the city of Johannesburg, where he had lived most of his life in the suburb of Greenside, honored Naudé in several ways. Naudé received the Freedom of the City of Johannesburg while DF Malan Drive, a major road in Johannesburg, was renamed Beyers Naudé Drive. The Library Gardens in downtown Johannesburg, formerly known as Market Square, were renamed as Beyers Naudé Square.
In 2004 Naudé was voted 36th among Top 100 Great South Africans in an informal poll conducted by a television program of the South African Broadcasting Corporation.

Naudé was called &quot;one of the true Christian prophets of our time&quot; by the acting secretary of the World Council of Churches, Georges Lemopoulos. Naudé&#x27;s comments after the 1976 Soweto uprising presciently anticipated an outflow of South Africans in the post-apartheid era. He warned that white privilege could not and should not endure.
&quot;For many it will be impossible to live in this new South African society; they will be destroyed physically, emotionally and psychologically. They would be allowed to stay, but they would find the atmosphere unacceptable and therefore many will say, &quot;we cannot adjust, we must go.&quot;&quot;
The University of the Free State changed the name of one of its hostels (JBM Hertzog) to Beyers Naudé. In Leeuwarden, Netherlands, the local Christian gymnasium (a middle school comparable to a grammar school) was renamed in honour of Beyers Naudé.

In the year 2002 a school in Soweto was named after him (Dr Beyers Naude high school.

<doc id="987785" wikidata="Q7570379" url="?curid=987785" title="Southern Railway multiple unit numbering and classification">
<text>The Southern Railway created classification and numbering systems for its large fleet of electric multiple units, perpetuated by the Southern Region of British Rail until the early 1980s, when the impact of TOPS was felt. Some stock is still allocated Southern-style classifications in a semi-official manner.

==Classification==
The early AC electric multiple units were referred to by a two-letter code. This was adapted for the DC third-rail system that was adopted by the Southern Railway, with units being given a three-letter code (sometimes two letters) prefixed by the number of cars in each unit, e.g. 4SUB for a four-car suburban unit.

The Southern Region perpetuated this, and the same principles were adopted for diesel-electric multiple units but with single-letter codes. The last type to be officially allocated a designation in this series was the PEP stock of the early 1970s. Some types built since have been given semi-official designations in this style.

&quot;This is different from the system used by British Rail (adopted from the LNER) to indicate the type of non-powered coach — see British Rail coach type codes.&quot;

===AC EMUs===
===DC EMUs===
===Diesel-electric multiple units===
==Unit numbering==
Unit numbers were allocated from 1001, following the 1–1000 set numbers of semi-fixed formations of hauled coaching stock. Different types of unit were given numbers:

This series was perpetuated by the Southern Region with modifications, as older set numbers were reused for the following different types:

2PEP reused number 2001, 4REP from 3001 and 4PEP 4001/4002. This series was abandoned in 1983, when units were renumbered to fit in with the TOPS classification system, which had nominally been in use for a decade. Even then, many units displayed only the last four digits, dropping the first two digits – e.g. unit 412 301 would have the number &quot;2301&quot; applied. Only with later units and 2xx series DEMUs were the full numbers shown, e.g. Classes 456, 458/5, 465 and 466, and some Class 455 sets, carry full six-digit numbers.

<doc id="987790" wikidata="Q1019110" url="?curid=987790" title="Bearskin">
<text>A bearskin is a tall fur cap derived from mitre caps worn by grenadier units in the 17th and 18th centuries. Initially worn by only grenadiers, bearskins were later used by several other military units in the 19th century. The bearskin cap continued to see use in battle during the mid-19th century, although by the 20th century, it was only used for parade dress. In the 21st century, the bearskin cap is retained by select military units as a prominent element of their ceremonial and full dress uniforms.

==History==
Use of the bearskin caps evolved from mitre caps used by grenadier units. Grenadiers adopted the mitre cap in favour of wide-brimmed caps in the 17th century to provide them with greater mobility when throwing grenades. To prevent the mitre cap from sagging and to provide it with a more impressive appearance, mitre caps were adorned with a metal front plate or fur. Mitre caps with metal front plates were first adopted by the Prussian Army and were later adopted by other Protestant countries, although the trimming of mitre caps with fur became more prevalent in Roman Catholic countries.

The earliest record of a bearskin-like cap being worn by soldiers in Europe was during the mid-17th century, although its widespread adoption did not take place until 1761, when French grenadiers began to wear tall fur caps resembling the Prussian mitre cap. The purpose appears to have been to add to the apparent height and impressive appearance of these troops both on the parade ground and the battlefield. These fur caps developed into the large bearskin caps worn by the French Imperial Guard. The British Grenadier Guards adopted the headdress after their victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, with other British units and European militaries adopting the headdress in the years after.

The headdress continued to see military service during the mid-19th century, with British foot guards and the Royal Scots Greys wearing bearskins in battle during the Crimean War. However, by the mid-19th century, the expense of acquiring bearskin caps and the difficulty in maintaining them in good condition under campaign conditions led to some armies limiting the use of the headdress to specific formal occasions. Military units, like the Italian 1st Regiment &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot;, eventually discontinued the use of the headgear altogether during that century.

The British continued to use the headdress during peacetime manoeuvres until the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902. Immediately before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, bearskins were still worn by several British, Belgian, Danish, German, Russian, and Swedish units as a part of their ceremonial/parade dress. Several regiments that retired the use of the headdress during the 19th century, including units in Italy and the Netherlands, also readopted it for ceremonial use during the 20th century.

==Contemporary use==
As of 2020, there were 14 countries whose militaries used bearskin as a part of their ceremonial uniforms. Some of these units wear bearskins made out of real bear fur, while other units use caps made out of synthetic fibres. In addition to military units, several civilian marching bands have also incorporated the bearskin cap as a part of their uniforms.

===Australia===
The Pipes and Drums Band of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment are authorised to wear a bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial dress.

===Belgium===
Two units in Belgium use the bearskin cap, the Belgian Royal Escort of the Belgian Federal Police, and the Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn – Grenadiers of the Belgian Armed Forces Land Component.

The uniforms of the Belgian Royal Escort, along with their bearskin caps, date back to 1939 when the unit was part of the Belgian Gendarmerie. Modelled after the Gendarmerie&#x27;s pre-1914 uniforms, the uniforms featured a bearskin cap adorned with a plume. Initially, Royal Belgian Escort captains wore bearskin caps with a white plume, while other unit members had caps with a different coloured plume. However, in 1997, the design of the bearskin caps was standardized, and red plumes were used on all caps regardless of rank except for the Commander of the Escort, riding besides the King. The Royal Belgian Escort continued to wear these uniforms after the Gendarmerie was merged with other police units to form the Federal Police in 2001.

Bearskins were worn as part of the field uniform of the &quot;Régiment des Grenadiers&quot; of the Belgian Army until 1908. After that year the fur headdress was retained only for parade wear until the outbreak of war in August 1914. Its successor unit, the &quot;Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn – Grenadiers&quot; uses the headdress as a part of its ceremonial dress.

===Canada===
The bearskin caps used by the Canadian Armed Forces are of black fur and include a coloured plume on the side of the bearskin and a gold-coloured chin strap. The materials used by Canadian bearskin caps are sourced from black bears hunted in Canada, although the Department of National Defence claims that the bearskin caps used by its units are made from bear furs that are over 20 years old. 

The Canadian Forces Dress Instructions authorise the use of bearskins for all its foot guards and fusilier regiments. In addition to foot guards and fusiliers, two line infantry regiments are also authorised to wear a bearskin cap with their ceremonial full-dress uniform: the Royal 22e Régiment (R22eR) and the Royal Regiment of Canada (RRegtC). Usage of the bearskin cap by the R22eR is attributed to its historical regimental alliance with the British Army&#x27;s Royal Welch Fusiliers, while the use of bearskins by the RRegtC is attributed to the regiment&#x27;s historical lineage from The Royal Grenadiers of the Canadian Militia.

Bearskins used by fusilier regiments and the R22eR have their unit&#x27;s cap badge at the front of the bearskin, while those of foot guards and the RRegtC do not have cap badges.

The following is a list of regiments whose members are authorised to wear a bearskin cap with their full dress uniform, along with the colour used on the unit&#x27;s plume:
* The Royal 22e Régiment, scarlet plume
* The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, scarlet plume
* The Canadian Grenadier Guards, white plume
* The Royal Regiment of Canada, scarlet over white plume
* Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent, white plume
* Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, white plume
* The Princess Louise Fusiliers, grey plume
* Les Fusiliers de Sherbrooke, white plume
In addition to these units, the drum major of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada&#x27;s pipe band are also authorised to wear the bearskin.

===Denmark===
The headgear was first adopted by the Royal Danish Army&#x27;s Royal Life Guards in 1805. The Royal Life Guards typically wear bearskin caps as a part of their uniform when performing public duties like at Amalienborg. However, on exceptionally warm days, they will be authorised to wear an alternative headgear to mitigate discomfort and prevent overheating.

The bearskin caps used by the Royal Life Guards are manufactured by Rützou saddlery at a workshop based in Taastrup. Rützou purchases its raw materials from a fur company based in Glostrup, which sources its furs from black bears in Canada. After the furs are acquired by Rützou, they are sent abroad to be dyed and tanned before they are returned to Rützou for processing and adaptation. The bearskin cap weighs approximately . Its fur is dyed jet black and its fur is at least in length.

The Royal Life Guards have approximately 600 to 700 bearskin caps in total. Given the limited number of bearskin caps, each headgear is used by approximately three different individuals each year. The bearskin caps last approximately 25 years with regular servicing and repairs, with the Royal Life Guards only ordering a limited number of new bearskins to replace worn-out caps.

===Italy===
The 1st Regiment &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot; of the Italian Army wears bearskin caps as a part of its ceremonial uniform. During the 19th century, the cost and maintenance of the bearskin cap resulted in the headgear&#x27;s limited use for only specific occasions, until the unit discontinued its use altogether. However, in the 20th century, the unit reintroduced the bearskin cap as a part of their ceremonial uniform. The bearskin caps used in the Italian military were once made out of real fur, although they later switched to synthetic materials.

===Kenya===
Members of the Kenya Army Band in the Kenya Defence Forces wear bearskin hats made out of synthetic fibres as a part of their full dress uniform.

===Netherlands===
The grenadier component of the Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles Guard Regiment wears a bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform. The unit was formed in 1995 through a merger of the Garderegiment Grenadiers and the Garderegiment Jagers. Although the two units were amalgamated, its jäger component does not wear bearskin caps, and its use is limited to only its grenadier component.

Bearskin caps in the Netherlands Armed Forces originated from mitre caps adorned with a metal front plate badge, used by Protestant grenadier units. Bearskin caps were adopted by the Garderegiment Grenadiers in 1829. However, the unit ceased using the headgear in 1843. 

The unit readopted the 1829 bearskin cap design for use as a part of its ceremonial uniform during the inauguration of Juliana of the Netherlands in 1948. However, as opposed to bear fur, the caps were made out of the black-haired Chinese fur goats purchased in the United Kingdom. In 1970, the unit replaced its bearskin caps with ones made out of artificial fur. Use of the ceremonial uniform and the bearskin cap continued by the grenadiers after the unit was amalgamated with the Garderegiment Jagers.

The bearskin cap used by the unit features a copper front plate shaped like a half-sun. A white plume is attached to the left of the bearskin cap, although the cap used by the unit&#x27;s commander will feature a unique plume to indicate rank. An orange cockade is also placed on the left. The front of the cap also equipped with a black leather visor. Drummers of the unit&#x27;s military band wear bearskins adorned with a white cotton tassel positioned at the center of the cap&#x27;s front, while their sousaphonists do not have a white plume on their bearskins.

===Spain===
The ceremonial uniforms worn by one company from the 1st King&#x27;s Immemorial Infantry Regiment includes a bearskin cap.

===Sri Lanka===
The military band of the Sri Lanka Artillery wear a black bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform.

===Sweden===
The parade uniforms used by the grenadier component of the Swedish Army&#x27;s Life Guards, known as model 1886, includes a bearskin cap.

The bearskin cap, known as model 1823, was once made out of real bearskin, although they have switched to using synthetic materials. The bearskin cap includes a front plate that depicts the coat of arms of Sweden and a white feather plume. Bearskins worn by officers will also include a yellow cockade and gold or silver cord. Bearskins worn by enlisted soldiers will include a red cockade and a white cord. The feathered plume is located on the left side of the headgear, with the cockade threaded into the wooden shaft of the plume. The cord is attached to the bearskin cap by a hook on the right side of the headgear.

===United Kingdom===

Use of the bearskin cap was adopted by all Foot Guards, and several other regiments, including the Royal Scots Greys and its successor unit, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. Drum majors of fusilier regiments will also generally wear a bearskin or artificial bearskin cap.

British bearskin caps were a form of headdress that evolved from mitre caps worn in the 18th century by grenadiers. In 1768, the long cloth caps worn by grenadiers were discontinued, and bearskin caps were introduced. Following the Battle of Waterloo, all members of the newly named Grenadier Guards were permitted to wear the bearskin. This privilege had previously been restricted to the grenadier company of the regiment. In 1831, this distinction was extended to the other two regiments of foot guards (Coldstream and Scots) in existence at that date. Bearskins were subsequently adopted by the Irish Guards and the Welsh Guards when raised in 1900 and 1915 respectively. 

The standard bearskin for the British foot guards is tall at the front, to the rear, weighs , and is made from the fur of the Canadian black bear. An officer&#x27;s bearskin is made from the fur of the Canadian brown bear, as the female brown bear has thicker, fuller fur; officers&#x27; caps are dyed black. An entire skin is used for each headdress. The British Army purchased the caps from a British hatmaker which sources its pelts at an international auction. The hatmakers purchase between 50 and 100 black bear skins each year at a cost of about £650 each.

On 3 August 1888, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that bearskin caps might be phased out because of a shortage of bear skins. The article stated that, at that time, bearskin hats cost £7–5s each (about 35 contemporary US dollars; £600 in 2007 pounds) and noted &quot;it can readily be seen what a price has to be paid for keeping up a custom which is rather old, it is true, but is practically a useless one save for the purpose of military display.&quot;

In 2005, the Ministry of Defence began a two-year test of artificial fur for the hats. The army has already replaced beaverskin caps and leopard skins, worn by some of its soldiers, with artificial materials. However, in 2020, the Ministry of Defence stated that it could not find a bearskin cap made out of alternative materials that matches the &quot;natural properties of bear fur&quot;, and claimed that artificial fur failed to meet four of its five requirements. The claim has been disputed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who filed for judicial review of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s decision in 2022, claiming that the ministry had failed to adhere to its procedures and that artificial fur meets and, in some cases, exceeds its requirements.

Between 2017 and 2022, the Ministry of Defence purchased 498 bearskin caps for use by its units.

New data obtained through a records request submitted by PETA reveals that the cost of bearskins worn by the King&#x27;s Guard has increased from £1,560 each in 2022 to £2,040 in 2023. The Ministry of Defence purchased 24 new bearskins in 2023 and 13 in 2022. Over the past decade, the ministry has spent more than £1 million on bearskins for the King&#x27;s Guard.

===United States===
Drum majors in military bands maintained by the United States Air Force, the United States Army, the United States Coast Guard, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Navy are authorised to wear bearskins. However, drum majors in the United States Army only wear bearskin caps for a &quot;handful of assignments&quot;, while the wearing of bearskins by drum majors in United States Air Force bands is optional. 

Drum majors of the United States Marine Corps Band began to wear bearskins in 1859. The bearskins worn by drum majors in the United States Marine Corps Band are made from real black bear fur sourced from Canada, and are styled after the bearskin caps worn by British officers. The bearskins worn by United States Army Band drum majors are also styled after European patterns and were initially made from real bear fur, although the Army later switched to using synthetic materials after it faced objections from environmentalists for using real fur.

The Second Company Governor&#x27;s Foot Guard of the Connecticut State Guard state defence force wears a bearskin cap as a part of their ceremonial uniform.

==Opposition against using real bearskin==

Criticism over the use of the headdress had emerged during the late 20th and 21st centuries. In 2023, a commentator for &quot;The New York Times&quot; questioned the use of the headdress after three members of the British Bands of the Household Division fainted during a rehearsal while in full dress uniform wearing woollen uniform and a bearskin, remarking how it was &quot;soldiering on in our old, wrong clothes&quot; in the light of climate change.

Several politicians have voiced their opposition to using the headgear due to its use of real bear furs. In 1997, the British Minister for Defence Procurement Lord Gilbert said that he wanted to see bearskins phased out as soon as possible due to ethical concerns. Similar sentiments were made in March 2005 by British Labour MP Chris Mullin, who called for an immediate ban on bearskins stating that they &quot;have no military significance and involve unnecessary cruelty.&quot; In 2023, the European Commission&#x27;s representative to Denmark launched a social media campaign advocating for the replacement of the bearskin caps used by the Danish Royal Life Guards with an artificial alternative, given the bear&#x27;s protected status within the European Union.

Animal rights group PETA has publicly voiced its opposition against the use of real bearskin since 2002, and has held demonstrations against its use in the United Kingdom, including one at St Peter&#x27;s Hill, near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, in 2006. In February 2011, Joss Stone appeared in a PETA advert targeting the British Ministry of Defence, showing the 23-year-old soul singer holding a teddy bear that covers her naked body, and features the slogan &#x27;Bear Hugs, Not Bear Caps&#x27;.

In January 2024, PETA launched a campaign against the use of real bearskin by the British and Canadian militaries and has called on both British and Canadian defence ministries to retire the headgear in favour of humane headgear sold by luxury faux furrier ECOPEL. PETA&#x27;s claims that the raw materials used to make the headgear is sourced from hunting bears with bait in Canada. However, the manufacturer of bearskin caps for the Danish Royal Life Guards, which also acquires bearskins sourced from Canada, claims that the culling of bears is necessary to regulate its population and that the hunt is monitored by biologists and approved by the World Wildlife Fund.

==Similar headgear==
===Other furred caps===
A busby is a furred cap that was historically worn by hussars, and remains in use as a part of the ceremonial uniforms for British and Canadian hussar units. In addition to hussars, the busby also forms a part of the ceremonial uniforms for British and Canadian artillery units and select rifle regiments. Other units that wear the busby as a part of their uniforms include the British Royal Corps of Signals and Royal Engineers, the Dutch Royal Marechaussee, and the First Company Governor&#x27;s Foot Guard of the Connecticut State Militia.

A sealskin cap is another furred cap similar to the bearskin cap, that is worn by the British Army&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

===Heavily plumed pith helmet===
Several units in the King&#x27;s Guard of the Royal Thai Armed Forces wear pith helmets with heavy plumes that broadly resemble a bearskin cap as a part of their ceremonial full dress uniform. The colours of the plumes vary depending on the units of the wearers. 

The majority of the units authorised to wear the bearskin cap are from the Royal Thai Army and Royal Thai Air Force, although two Royal Thai Marine Corps battalions are also entitled to wear the headdress. In addition, the Royal Security Command&#x27;s two guards regiments wear pith helmets with black plumes as their full dress headdress.

<text>Barlow&#x27;s wheel was an early demonstration of a homopolar motor, designed and built by English mathematician and physicist, Peter Barlow in 1822. It consists of a star-shaped wheel free to turn suspended over a trough of the liquid metal mercury, with the points dipping into the mercury, between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. A DC electric current passes from the hub of the wheel, through the wheel into the mercury and out through an electrical contact dipping into the mercury. The Lorentz force of the magnetic field on the moving charges in the wheel causes the wheel to rotate. The presence of serrations on the wheel is unnecessary and the apparatus will work with a round metal disk, usually made of copper.

:&quot;The points of the wheel, R, dip into mercury contained in a groove hollowed in the stand. A more rapid revolution will be obtained if a small electro-magnet be substituted for a steel magnet, as is shown in the cut. The electro-magnet is fixed to the stand, and included in the circuit with the spur-wheel, so that the current flows through them in succession. Hence, the direction of the rotation will not be changed by reversing that of the current; since the polarity of the electromagnet will also be reversed.&quot;

:(&quot;Excerpt taken from the 1842 edition of the Manual of Magnetism, page 94&quot;)

It is used as a demonstration of electromagnetism in physics education. Because mercury is toxic, brine is sometimes used in place of mercury in modern recreations of the experiment.

== How it works ==

Action of a magnet on current and how rotational motion is produced due to this can be shown by Barlow&#x27;s wheel experiment. The apparatus consists of a star shaped copper wheel capable of rotating freely in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. The point of each spoke of the star just dips into a pool of mercury kept in a small groove on the wooden base of the apparatus. The pool of mercury is kept in between the two opposite poles of a strong magnet. The wheel rotates with its plane being perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field and during its rotation only one point of the star dips into the pool of mercury at a time. When the axis of the wheel and the mercury are connected to electric cell, the circuit is completed through the axis of the wheel (when a point dips in the mercury) and the mercury. On passing current through the circuit the wheel will begin to rotate due to the action of the magnet on the current. The direction of rotation of the wheel can be determined by applying Fleming&#x27;s left hand rule. While rotating and when a spoke of the wheel just leaves the mercury the circuit breaks but due to inertia of motion the wheel continues its motion and brings the next spoke in contact with the mercury thereby restoring the electrical contact. In this way rotation of the wheel continues. On reversing the direction of the current or that of the magnetic field the wheel rotates in the opposite direction. The speed of rotation depends upon the strength of the magnetic field and the strength of the current. Here mechanical energy is obtained from electrical energy.

<text>Josef Klaus (15 August 1910 – 25 July 2001) was an Austrian politician of the conservative People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP). He served as State Governor (&quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;) of Salzburg from 1949 to 1961, as Minister of Finance from 1961 to 1963 and as Chancellor of Austria from 1964 to 1970.

==Biography==
Born in Kötschach-Mauthen, Carinthia, the son of a master baker, Klaus attended the Catholic junior seminary in Klagenfurt. He studied law at the University of Vienna, where he joined the &quot;Cartellverband&quot; of Catholic male student fraternities (&quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;). He obtained his doctorate in 1934 and worked in the legal department of the Chamber of Labour which at that time was integrated into the Austrofascist unitary trade union centres by the government of the Federal State of Austria. When the Chamber organisation finally was liquidated after the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; annexation by Nazi Germany, Klaus changed to the private sector.

In 1936, Klaus married Ernestine Seywald (2 April 1914 – 1 January 2001). During World War II he served in the German Wehrmacht, temporarily as a staff member for General Heinz Guderian, as well as in campaigns in Poland, France, Finland and Russia. He was captured in early 1945 and held in a POW camp. After the war he worked as a lawyer in Hallein; in 1948 he became chairman of the regional ÖVP section Hallein District and pursued his political career.

Klaus was elected governor of the Austrian state of Salzburg in 1949. Re-elected twice in 1954 and 1959, he rose to a leading member of the ÖVP. When his party colleague, Chancellor Julius Raab, finally resigned in 1961, Klaus&#x27; influence as a representative of the &quot;young reformers&quot; grew. He became Minister of Finance under Raab&#x27;s successor Alfons Gorbach, whom he succeeded as ÖVP party chairman on 20 September 1963. When Gorbach resigned on 25 February 1964, Klaus also followed him as Chancellor.

In office from 2 April 1964, Klaus initially continued the grand coalition with the Socialists under Vice-Chancellor Bruno Pittermann according to the &quot;Proporz&quot; system that had governed Austria since 1945. He led the ÖVP into the 1966 legislative election, during which he called for an end to the coalition. At that election, the ÖVP won a three-seat majority, theoretically leaving Klaus free to break off the coalition. However, reversing himself, Klaus proposed new coalition terms to Pittermann&#x27;s successor as Socialist leader, Bruno Kreisky. Talks broke down when the Socialist rank and file balked at the proposed terms. Klaus then formed an exclusively ÖVP cabinet, the first one-party government of the Second Republic. In June first steps were agreed on joining the European Economic Community which in the long run finally led to Austria joining the European Union in 1995.

Klaus started many reforms and is remembered for his effective stewardship of the government, but he lost the 1970 election to Kreisky&#x27;s Socialists. Klaus might have been able to continue by entering into a coalition with the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), but immediately resigned after losing the elections.

Despite his &quot;hard image&quot;, Klaus was celebrated at his 90th birthday all over the country. In September 1971 he published his memoirs &quot;Macht und Ohnmacht in Österreich&quot;, and up to 1995 he frequently led seminars on political and social themes.

Klaus died on 25 July 2001 at the age of 90.

<text>Brachystegia spiciformis, commonly known as zebrawood, or msasa, is a medium-sized African tree having compound leaves and racemes of small fragrant green flowers. The tree is broad and has a distinctive amber and wine red colour when the young leaves sprout during spring (August–September). It grows in savanna, both open woodland and closed woodland of Southern and Eastern Africa, mostly Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique.
The word msasa is commonly used as a proper name in African place names. The word also means &#x27;rough plant&#x27; in Swahili.
Other common names: mundu, myombo, mtondo (Tanzania), muputu (Zambia). The plant is known in the Venda language as mutsiwa, which means &#x27;the one that is left behind&#x27;. An outlying population of &quot;Brachystegia&quot; has recently been discovered in the Soutpansberg mountains of northern South Africa. This tree is a protected species in South Africa.

==Distribution==
The msasa is a tropical tree and grows best in open woodland where there is a sharp distinction between wet and dry seasons. The northern end of its range is near Tabora in Tanzania (about 5° S) and its southernmost extent is near Quissico on the coast of Mozambique just outside the tropics (about 25° S). Msasas need a minimum of around 500 mm rain, although the amount of rain in the summer growing season is more important than the annual rainfall. It needs a mean annual temperature of around 19 to 20 °C. It does not thrive under a combination of cold and wet conditions, and like many tropical plants it requires a hot dry period before the onset of the growing season.

==Appearance==
The tree typically reaches a height of about 16 metres, although it is less tall in more drought-prone areas. In central Zambia and eastern Angola, magnificent specimens of about 18–19 metres are common due to the reliability of heavy rain during the growing season. It favours inland situations at an altitude of around 1000–1400 metres (due to the sharp difference between day and nighttime temperatures), although it grows down to sea level at its southern extremity. The tree presents a series of changes according to the seasons. It starts to lose its leaves as the cool season begins in late May (somewhat sluggishly), and by early August it is bare or nearly so. In late August, as temperatures rise again, the new leaves are produced. These are often bright red in colour, but vary from almost purple to brownish in different individuals. The colour shifts to deep green over a period of 10–20 days. The insignificant flowers appear after the new leaves and these are followed by the dehiscent pods (about 12–15 cm in length) in April. As with many legume species the pods split explosively and the flat seeds (about 2 cm across) are flung some distance from the parent tree.

==Ecology==
The msasa is ecologically dominant over large areas of central Africa where sufficient summer rainfall is received. In many parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, it is the dominant woodland tree, and its colourful springtime foliage is a striking seasonal marker. It can withstand light frost as long as little rain falls during the cool season, such as on the Mashonaland plateau, where it is often co-dominant with the similar mnondo (&quot;Julbernardia globiflora&quot;). Further north it is less dominant, but it reaches its greatest size.
The msasa develops heavy spreading boughs and a shapely crown and mature specimens are valued in parks and gardens. However, it grows very slowly, so is seldom grown in cultivation.

Characteristic strength of Msasa
==Uses==
Just as its appearance varies greatly from place to place, so does its use. While in some regions, where msasa trees do not grow very tall, it is often heavily branched and used mainly as fuel such as charcoal and firewood, in other parts, such as central and northern Mozambique, it is used for furniture, sleepers, and construction timber. In parts of southern Tanzania, the hard wood is highly sought after. It is also used for beehives, boats, and general construction. It is considered an all-purpose wood. Furniture production has increased, since the wood can be artificially dried in kilns, which prevents further drying and twisting of the processed wood.

In southern Tanzania, &quot;B. spiciformis&quot; has several medicinal applications, including using the roots to treat dysentery and stomach problems. It is an important shade tree. The leaves are known to be a good fodder and would likely provide good mulch. The species is not nitrogen-fixing.

<doc id="987817" wikidata="Q882518" url="?curid=987817" title="Blue Line (withdrawal line)">
<text>The Blue Line is a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights. It was published by the United Nations on 7 June 2000 for the purposes of determining whether Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon. It has been described as &quot;temporary&quot; and &quot;not a border, but a “line of withdrawal”. It is the subject of an ongoing border dispute between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah.

On 19 March 1978, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolutions 425 and 426 calling for Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon following its recent invasion and to ensure that the government of Lebanon restores effective authority in the area to the border. The United Nations Security Council and NATO set up the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as a peacekeeping force to supervise the situation in Southern Lebanon.

By September 2018 Israel completed 11 kilometers of a concrete Israel-Lebanon barrier on the Israeli side of the demarcation line to protect Israeli communities from infiltration by Hezbollah militants. The length of the barrier is and was expected to be complete by 2020. The project was expected to cost $450 million. Most of the barrier is a concrete wall topped by steel mesh, sensors and surveillance cameras. Steel fencing was used instead of concrete in especially rugged areas.

== Origin ==
On 11 March 1978 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operatives, led by Dalal Mugrabi, carried out the Coastal Road massacre within Israel which resulted in the deaths of 37 Israelis, including 13 children, and 76 wounded. In response, Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon from which the PLO operated regularly during the 1970s. Starting on the night of March 14–15 and culminating a few days later, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops occupied the entire southern part of Lebanon except for the city of Tyre and its surrounding area. 

This operation is known in Israel as Operation Litani, the stated objective of which was to clear out PLO bases in Lebanon south of the Litani River, in order to better secure northern Israel and to support the Christian Lebanese militias in the Lebanese Civil War - most notably the Free Lebanon Army. 

On 15 March 1978 the Lebanese government submitted a strong protest to the United Nations Security Council against the Israeli invasion, stating that it had no connection with the Palestinian operation.

On 19 March 1978 the Council adopted Resolution 425, in which it called upon Israel to cease immediately its military action and withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory. It also established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The first UNIFIL troops arrived in the area on 23 March 1978.

The Blue Line is based on the deployment of the IDF prior to 14 March 1978. It should not be confused with the Green Line, established in 1949, which is the armistice line of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, nor the Green Line in Beirut during the violence of the 1980s. The 1949 line is in turn the same as the 1923 Mandate Line, which was the border between French- and British-mandated territory. See: Paulet–Newcombe Agreement. Lebanon is a former French mandate and Palestine / Israel a former British mandate, per the League of Nations. The 1949 agreement stated that the border would follow the 1923 line. 

In 1923, 38 boundary markers were placed along the 49 mile border and a detailed text description was published. The 2000 Blue Line differs in about a half dozen short stretches from the 1949 line, though never by more than 475 meters.

Borders are usually negotiated between countries, and between 1950 and 1967 Israeli and Lebanese surveyors managed to complete 25 non-contiguous kilometers and mark, but not sign, another quarter of the international border. On 17 April 2000, when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced that Israel would begin withdrawing its forces from Lebanon, the Lebanese government did not want to take part in marking the border. The UN conducted its own survey based on the line discussed in United Nations Security Council Resolution 425.

On 25 May 2000 the government of Israel notified the Secretary-General that Israel had redeployed its forces in compliance with Security Council resolutions 425.

From 24 May to 7 June 2000, a UN Special Envoy traveled to Israel and Lebanon to follow up on the implementation of the Secretary-General&#x27;s May 22 report. The United Nations cartographer and his team, assisted by UNIFIL, worked on the ground to identify a line to be adopted for the practical purposes of confirming the Israeli withdrawal. While it was agreed that this would not be a formal border demarcation, the aim was to identify a line on the ground closely conforming to the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon, based on the best available cartographic and other documentary evidence.

On 7 June 2000, the completed map showing the withdrawal line was formally transmitted by the Force Commander of UNIFIL to his Lebanese and Israeli counterparts. Notwithstanding their reservations about the line, the Governments of Israel and Lebanon confirmed that identifying this line was solely the responsibility of the United Nations and that they would respect the line as identified. On 8 June, UNIFIL teams led by Lebanese Brig. General Imad Anka and Brigadier General Amin Htait began the work of verifying the Israeli withdrawal behind the line.

On 16 June the Secretary-General reported to the Security Council that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 (1978) and met the requirements defined in his report of 22 May 2000. Namely, that Israel had completed the withdrawal in conformity with the line identified by the United Nations, the South Lebanese Army militia had been dismantled, and all detainees held at Al-Khiam prison had been freed.

The withdrawal line has been termed the Blue Line in all official UN communications since.

== Border dispute ==
Despite the Blue Line being respected as a de facto boundary, there remains a border dispute that arose after Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from territory it occupied in southern Lebanon in 2002, with Lebanon arguing that Israel is still holding Lebanese lands, even though the United Nations certified the withdrawal. As of October 2023, Amos Hochstein, the US government official who helped resolve the Israeli–Lebanese maritime border dispute, was holding talks to resolve the land border dispute.

The border dispute is based around 13 or 14 points, including in the village of Ghajar, Shebaa Farms and the hills around Kfarchouba. Dorothy Shea, a former ambassador to Lebanon, said that talks had settled at least 7 of the disputed points. A retired Lebanese general described the majority of the disputed areas as &quot;fighting over a couple of centimeters&quot;.

; Rosh HaNikra/Naqoura: The westmost point of the land connection between Lebanon and Israel lies in between the Israeli kibbutz of Rosh Hanikra and the Lebanese city of Naqoura. The exact point where Lebanon, Israel, and the Mediterranean Sea has been designated as Point B1, and is the starting off point for the negotiated sea border. However, the ownership of B1 is in dispute with Lebanon making a claim, citing the 1923 Paulet–Newcombe Agreement. Israel is reportedly reluctant to surrender the peak, since it is a high point that provides a view as far as Haifa.

; Kafr Kila: Kafr Kila abuts Israel from Lebanon. Israel has constructed a security wall at the edge of the city, and has undertaken several operations to destroy tunnels from the village to northern Israel.
; Shebaa Farms/Ghajar: Israel continues to occupy northern Ghajar, but has attempted to withdraw repeatedly. This withdrawal to southern Ghajar has been complicated by residents objection to both the splitting of the village and Lebanese control, preferring a united village under Israeli control. Shebaa Farms, a nearby area, has a more complicated status. Israel and the United Nations view the territory as originally belonging to Syria, and therefore not covered by UNSC Resolution 1701. Lebanon claims it as Lebanese territory, and views the Israeli presence as a violation of international law.

==Violations==

The &quot;de facto&quot; boundary has been violated on multiple occasions. Most famously, Israel continues to occupy northern Ghajar. The majority of border violations are exchanges of fire or other limited military operations. 

On 7 October 2000, Hezbollah forces abducted three Israeli soldiers while the latter patrolled the southern (Israeli) side of the demarcation line. The soldiers were killed either during the attack or shortly after. This sparked the 2000–06 Shebaa Farms conflict, which began at a low-intensity, but steadily escalated. From 2000 to 2007, Israeli jets violated Lebanese airspace over 1,600 times, often breaking the sound barrier over several southern villages. Lebanese troops responded by firing at the Israeli jets with anti-aircraft weapons. The conflict culminated in the 34day 2006 Lebanon War. Israel responded to diversionary rocketing of civilian villages and an attack on an Israeli tank patrol with massive airstrikes and artillery fire on Lebanese targets and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

The border stayed quiet until the 2010 Israel–Lebanon border clash, in which Lebanese Armed Forces opened fire on Israeli army soldiers performing tree-cutting maintenance work on the Israeli side of the Blue Line, killing one. Three Lebanese died when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded. Lebanese Information Minister Tarek Mitri stated despite the fact that Lebanon accepted the earlier Blue line &quot;The area where the tree was to be cut yesterday […] is south of the Blue Line but is Lebanese territory.&quot; 

In 2011, UNIFIL confirmed a border incident in which no one was hurt. Israel and Lebanon offered differing accounts of the incident. A Lebanese military official said Israeli troops crossed the Blue Line, 30 meters into Lebanese territory, prompting Lebanese soldiers to fire warning shots and the Israeli troops to retreat and fire at Lebanese border posts. The Israeli military sources said their forces were within Israeli territory when they came under fire from across the border.

On 15 December 2013, a Lebanese Army sniper shot dead an Israeli soldier in the Rosh Hanikra border.

In 2015, after an Israeli attack against a military convoy carrying Hezbollah and Iranian officers in southern Syria, on 28 January 2015, Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at an Israeli military convoy in the Shebaa farms, killing two soldiers and wounding seven. In response, Israel fired at least 50 artillery shells across the border into southern Lebanon, killing a Spanish UN peacekeeper.

In December 2018, Israel initiated Operation Northern Shield to destroy cross-border tunnels built by Hezbollah along the border.

On 27 July 2020, Israeli soldiers and four Hezbollah combatants exchanged fire. 

In 2021, rockets and a drone were launched from Southern Lebanon into Israel, which responded with artillery fire. There were no reported casualties but the rockets ignited a bush fire.

In 2023 and 2024, a large number of Blue Line violations by Hezbollah, Palestinian factions under their control, and Israel took place during the Israel–Hamas war and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict.

<text>RegioExpress, commonly abbreviated to RE, is a category of fast regional train service in Switzerland, run by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) or other railway companies (such as TILO, BLS, tpf, THURBO or RhB, previously also by transN). A few lines also serve stations in Germany, France and Italy. Since 2023, all RE services are numbered for more clarity.

It is comparable to the Regional-Express in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. Its speed is considerably faster than regional trains at the same level, as it does not stop at all stations served by the regional trains. Nonetheless, it is slightly slower than InterRegio trains. Swiss Federal Railways describes the trains as ones that serve &quot;rapidly into the regions&quot;.

==List of services==
 the following RegioExpress services exist:
==History==
Until the 2003 timetable overhaul (December 2002 to December 2003), the RegioExpress was limited in circulation. One of the main lines which ran as a RegioExpress line (abbreviation: RX) was the &quot;Rheintal Express&quot;, from St. Gallen through Sargans to Chur (the other was the &quot;CityVogel&quot; from Zürich to Konstanz). As of the 2004 timetable overhaul, the RegioExpress was introduced as faster Regio (formerly regional) trains; the term was thrown into expanded usage. The abbreviation was changed to RE instead of the previous RX in the 2005 timetable. Recently, several companies have begun to number their RE lines, such as the TPF.

<text>Saúl Mendoza Hernández (born January 6, 1967, in Mexico City) is a Mexican former wheelchair racer, who competed at the Olympic and Paralympic levels.

He acquired polio when he was 6 months old and grew up playing a variety of different sports. At the 2000 Olympic Games, he finished first in the demonstration event of Men&#x27;s 1500m wheelchair. He finished second in the same event at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He won six medals in different athletics events at the Paralympic Games – 2 gold, 1 silver, and 3 bronze – in a career that spanned from Seoul 1988 to Beijing 2008. He was the flag-bearer for the Mexican team in the Sydney 2000 and Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games.

Mendoza won the Men&#x27;s Wheelchair Race of the London Marathon in 2004 in controversial circumstances after following a police motorbike through a shortcut on the course near the turn-around at The Cutty Sark, cutting the course short by approximately 200m. He went on to finish the race with a comfortable lead ahead of British athlete David Weir and escaped disqualification. He went on to defend this title in 2005. He has also won the wheelchair division in the Twin Cities Marathon nine times.

The 2008 Paralympic Games were his sixth and final Paralympic appearance, as he had previously announced he would retire from competition after the Games. Online records indicate he competed in the 2012 Paralympics, and is currently active on Linked In, a professional networking group.

However, he returned to the sport to compete in the 2012 London Paralympic marathon on Sunday 9 September having earlier in the season set a new personal best of 1:24:23.

At these Games, Fearnley won two silver medals in the 800 m and 4×100 m relay events. He also represented his country in the demonstration sport of Men&#x27;s 1500 m wheelchair, where he came 4th. He went to the 2002 IPC Athletics World Championships in Birmingham, England and finished 7th in both the 400 m and 800 m T54 events.

At the 2004 Olympic Games, he finished 5th in the demonstration sport of Men&#x27;s 1500 m wheelchair. Following this he won two gold medals in the 5000 m T54 and marathon T54 events at the 2004 Athens Paralympics, for which he received a Medal of the Order of Australia. At the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships in Assen, Netherlands, he won three gold medals and one bronze medal. Participating in his third Paralympics in Beijing, he won a gold medal in the marathon T54, two silver medals in the 800 m T54 and 5000 m T54 events and a bronze medal in the 1500 m T54 event.

On 30 September 2009, Fearnley conducted a training climb of Sydney&#x27;s Centrepoint Tower&#x27;s 1,504 fire stairs in 20 minutes, taking them two at a time. While far short of the 6m 52s record for the annual charity climb (Sydney Tower Run-up), the Tower&#x27;s manager said this was quicker than the 25 minutes required by most able-bodied people. In 2009, he won his fourth New York City Marathon title, his third consecutive title in the Chicago Marathon and victories in Seoul, Paris, London and Sydney. In November 2009, Fearnley crawled the Kokoda Trail accompanied by family and friends in support of Movember and Beyond Blue. He completed the journey in 10 days. In 2009, he was awarded the Young Australian of the Year for New South Wales.

Fearnley is active in advocacy work, and has been an ambassador for the Don&#x27;t DIS my ABILITY campaign for four years. He was also a 2010 International Day of People with Disability Ambassador. In 2010, Fearnley competed again in the New York marathon, which he came in third. In the same year his image was featured on the medal for the 2010 Blackmores Sydney Running Festival. He also won a gold medal at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games in the 1500 m T54 event.

In early 2011 at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand, he won the marathon. Later in the year, Fearnley competed in the 2011 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. 

At the 2012 London Paralympics, he was aiming to be the first person to win three consecutive marathon T54 gold medals. However, he instead won a bronze medal in the Men&#x27;s Marathon T54 and a silver medal in the Men&#x27;s 5000 m T54.

Fearnley won a bronze medal in the 1500 m T54 at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games; he had been fighting a virus in the days before the event. In November 2014, he won his fifth New York Marathon men&#x27;s wheelchair event. After the competition, he stated &quot;That was one of the toughest races of my life&quot; due to the high winds that nearly forced the cancellation of the wheelchair event.

At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, he finished fourth in the Men&#x27;s 5000 m T54 and did not progress to the final of the Men&#x27;s 1500 m T54. He left Doha immediately to compete in the New York Marathon where he finished fifth after crashing at the 12-mile mark. On Australia Day 2016, he won the Oz Day 10K Wheelchair Road Race for the tenth time joining Louise Sauvage as a ten-time winner of this prestigious wheelchair road race.

Throughout 2015, Fearnley co-established and co-hosted the groundbreaking live online “All Sports Show” in his home town of Newcastle and polished his skills front of the camera with fellow co-hosts sports administrator Ivan Spyrdz, distinguished journalist Brett Keeble and local sports star and former NRL player Darren Forward.

At his last Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Fearnley won the silver medal in the Men&#x27;s Marathon T54 and the bronze medal in the Men&#x27;s 5000 m T53/54.
Fearnley indicated he will race in the wheelchair marathon at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and continue to race marathons on the international circuit. At the end of the marathon, Fearnley said: &quot;One of my biggest strengths is that I deal with discomfort better than most.&quot;

At the 2017 World Para Athletics Championships in London, England, Fearnley finished sixth in both the Men&#x27;s 1500 m and 5000 m T54 events.

At the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, Fearnley won the gold medal in the Men&#x27;s Marathon T54 and silver in the Men&#x27;s 1500 T54. He was given the honour of the flag bearer at the closing ceremony.

Fearnley was coached by Andrew Dawes at the New South Wales Institute of Sport.

In 2020 Fearnley continued his media career, joining the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to host a long form television interview program &quot;Kurt Fearnley&#x27;s One Plus One&quot;.

<doc id="987846" wikidata="Q7435467" url="?curid=987846" title="Scot Hollonbeck">
<text>Scot Hollonbeck (born 1969) is an American wheelchair racer, who competed at the Olympic and Paralympic level. At the 1996 Olympic Games, he placed second in the 1500m wheelchair racing event. 2000 Summer Olympic Games, he placed sixth in the 1500m wheelchair racing event. At the 2004 Olympic Games, he finished 4th in the 1500m wheelchair racing event. Men&#x27;s 1500m wheelchair. At the 1992 Olympic Games, he finished 5th in the 1500m wheelchair racing event. Men&#x27;s 1500m wheelchairHe competed in four consecutive Summer Olympic finals, winning one silver medal and Summer Paralympics from 1992 to 2004, winning a total of two gold and three silver medals.

Hollonbeck became a paraplegic at age 14 after being hit by a van while bicycling to swim practice. Only days after the accident, while still in the hospital, he watched a wheelchair race on television where Sharon Hedrick broke the world record in the 800 meters. Having been a competitive runner he immediately became interested in the sport and attended a camp for disabled athletes at the University of Illinois the next summer.

While attending Rochelle Township High School in Rochelle, Illinois, he was a member of the school&#x27;s track and field team. As a sophomore, he was allowed to race in a wheelchair division. As the only wheeler he often raced in mixed heats with runners, the wheeler and runner heats were scored separately. For his last two years of high school, however, the school barred him from competing in mixed heats with runners because of safety issues. Despite the fact that Scot trained every day with the runner in mixed practices, he was deemed &quot;unsafe&quot; during competition. In 1987 Hollonbeck filed a lawsuit against the school system. This was the first case in the country concerning the right for disabled students to compete on their school teams. In late 1988, after he had graduated from the school, a federal judge ruled that school officials had violated his civil rights, as provided for in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by not allowing him to argue his case. The judge did not rule on whether high school wheelchair athletes should be able to compete alongside or against their non-disabled peers.

Hollonbeck received an athletic scholarship to the University of Illinois and was a member of the school&#x27;s wheelchair basketball and track and field teams. He later moved to Atlanta, Georgia to work for The Coca-Cola Company in the Worldwide Sports Department. He continues to be a disabled sports policy expert and access advocate.

<text>Salomon Bochner (20 August 1899 – 2 May 1982) was a Galizien-born mathematician, known for work in mathematical analysis, probability theory and differential geometry.

==Life==
He was born into a Jewish family in Podgórze (near Kraków), then Austria-Hungary, now Poland. Fearful of a Russian invasion in Galicia at the beginning of World War I in 1914, his family moved to Germany, seeking greater security. Bochner was educated at a Berlin gymnasium (secondary school), and then at the University of Berlin. There, he was a student of Erhard Schmidt, writing a dissertation involving what would later be called the Bergman kernel. Shortly after this, he left the academy to help his family during the escalating inflation. After returning to mathematical research, he lectured at the University of Munich from 1924 to 1933. His academic career in Germany ended after the Nazis came to power in 1933, and he left for a position at Princeton University. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1945 to 1948. He was appointed as Henry Burchard Fine Professor in 1959, retiring in 1968. Although he was seventy years old when he retired from Princeton, Bochner was appointed as Edgar Odell Lovett Professor of Mathematics at Rice University and went on to hold this chair until his death in 1982. He became Head of Department at Rice in 1969 and held this position until 1976. He died in Houston, Texas. He was an Orthodox Jew.

==Mathematical work==
In 1925 he started work in the area of almost periodic functions, simplifying the approach of Harald Bohr by use of compactness and approximate identity arguments. In 1933 he defined the Bochner integral, as it is now called, for vector-valued functions. Bochner&#x27;s theorem on Fourier transforms appeared in a 1932 book. His techniques came into their own as Pontryagin duality and then the representation theory of locally compact groups developed in the following years.

Subsequently, he worked on multiple Fourier series, posing the question of the Bochner–Riesz means. This led to results on how the Fourier transform on Euclidean space behaves under rotations.

In differential geometry, Bochner&#x27;s formula on curvature from 1946 was published. Joint work with Kentaro Yano (1912–1993) led to the 1953 book &quot;Curvature and Betti Numbers&quot;. It had consequences, for the Kodaira vanishing theory, representation theory, and spin manifolds. Bochner also worked on several complex variables (the Bochner–Martinelli formula and the book &quot;Several Complex Variables&quot; from 1948 with W. T. Martin).

<text>Eliza Stankovic-Mowle (née Ault-Connell; born 19 September 1981) is an Australian wheelchair racer, who competed at Paralympic and Olympic Games. She survived meningococcal disease and plays a major role in improving the Australian community&#x27;s awareness of the disease.

==Early life==
Eliza Jane Ault-Connell was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 19 September 1981. In 1997, at the age of 16, she nearly died from meningococcal disease. She had both her legs amputated above the knees two days after contracting the disease. She said &quot;Amputation wasn&#x27;t a decision I had to make: I was in a coma at the time. Mum and Dad were told that&#x27;s what had to be done to save my life, so in that sense there was no choice.&quot; Later she had to make the decision to have most of the fingers on each hand removed. She was in hospital for six months and in 1998, she acquired prosthetic legs.

She is the Director of Meningococcal Australia and is involved in promoting the awareness of meningococcal disease in the Australian community.

In 2022, she was part of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Accelerate program that is designed to increase the number and visibility of women in sport leadership positions. She is an Ambassador for Wheelchair Sports NSW/ACT.

==Athletics career==
Before her illness, Stankovic excelled in netball and basketball. In 1998, she started running using her prosthetic legs and was classed T44 athlete. However, she moved to wheelchair racing as a T54 athlete due to a problem with the bone in the stump. During her athletics, she competed as Eliza Ault-Connell.

Ault-Connell&#x27;s first major international competition was 2002 Commonwealth Games where she won the bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s Wheelchair 800m. At the 2002 IPC Athletics World Championships, she competed in three events and won a silver medal in the Women&#x27;s 400m T54 event. At the 2004 Olympic Games, she finished second in the demonstration sport of Women&#x27;s 1500 m wheelchair and the Women&#x27;s 800 m wheelchair. She also participated in the 2004 Summer Paralympics. At the 2004 Athens Paralympics, she competed in five events and did not medal. Ault-Connell won three consecutive Oz Day 10K Wheelchair Road Race from 2004 to 2006. She won a bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s 800m T54 at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. At the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships, she competed in three events and won a bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s 800m T54.

At the 2019 London Marathon which was also the 2019 World Para Athletics Championships marathon event, she finished fourth in the Women&#x27;s T46. At 2019 World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai, she won the bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s 800m T54.

She was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &quot;for significant service to community health, and as a Paralympic athlete.&quot;

She at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Paralympics, her second Summer Paralympics, In the T54 events she qualified for the finals and came 8th in the 100m and 7th in the 400m. and 13th in the Marathon. She announced her retirement from competitive athletics in August 2022.

<text>Alix Louise Sauvage, OAM (born 18 September 1973) is an Australian paralympic wheelchair racer and leading coach.

Sauvage is often regarded as the most renowned disabled sportswoman in Australia. She won nine gold and four silver medals at four Paralympic Games and eleven gold and two silver medals at three IPC Athletics World Championships. She has won four Boston Marathons, and held world records in the 1500 m, 5000 m and 4x100 m and 4x400 m relays. She was Australian Female Athlete of the Year in 1999, and International Female Wheelchair Athlete of the Year in 1999 and 2000. In 2002, her autobiography &quot;Louise Sauvage: My Story&quot; was published.

==Early life==

Sauvage was born in 1973 in Perth, Western Australia, the daughter of Rita (née Rigden) and Maurice Sauvage. Her mother was a Ten Pound Pom from Leicestershire, England, while her father was born in the British colony of Seychelles. She was born with a severe congenital spinal condition called myelomeningocele, which inhibits the function of the lower half of the body, giving limited control over the legs. In 1976 she was Perth&#x27;s &quot;Telethon Child&quot; as part of a Channel 7 fund-raiser for children with disabilities. She used calipers to help walk until she received her first wheelchair. Her myelomeningocele required her to have 21 surgical operations by the time she was ten years old. As a preteen, Sauvage had scoliosis, and at 14, she had surgery to fix a curvature in her spine, using steel rods. The operation was only partially successful, and as an adult, she still has a curve of roughly 49 degrees. She has not had any subsequent surgery to fix the curve in her spine.

Sauvage grew up in Joondanna, Western Australia, attending Tuart Hill Primary School and Hollywood Senior High School before leaving to complete a TAFE course in office and secretarial studies. She underwent 20 operations before the age of 10. Her parents encouraged her to participate in sport from a very young age. She started swimming when she was three years old, with her parents enrolling her in swimming classes to help her build upper body strength. Sauvage started to compete in wheelchair sport at the age of eight. Before that time, she had attempted to play school sport with her classmates but her disability made it difficult. She took up competitive wheelchair racing when she was 15. Sauvage also tried wheelchair basketball as a youngster.

==Competitive athletic career==


From the ages of 10 to 13, Sauvage represented Western Australia in the national swim championships. She was forced to retire from swimming when she turned 14, because of surgery.

When Sauvage first started competing in wheelchair racing, the chairs all had four wheels and were similar to the chairs that they used off the track. The chairs did not have any form of steering. The front wheels were smaller than the back wheels, and when at high speed, they were prone to wobbling. By 1997, racing wheelchairs had basically finished undergoing massive changes to improve them.

In 1990, Sauvage competed in her first international competition in Assen, Holland, where she won gold in the 100 m setting a new world record. She also won the 200 m race but was disqualified for moving out of her lane. At the Stoke Mandeville Games in England the same year, Sauvage took gold in the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, and two relays.

===Paralympic Games===

Before the start of the 1992 Summer Paralympics, Sauvage held Australian records for the 100 m, 200 m, 800 m, 1500 m and marathon in women&#x27;s wheelchair racing events. She was being marketed by the Australian Paralympic Federation as Australia&#x27;s top female wheelchair road racer. At the Barcelona Paralympic Games, she won gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m and a silver in the 800 m TW4 events and finished sixth in Marathon TW3-4. In recognition of her athletic feats she was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. Sauvage was in danger of not going to the 1992 Paralympics because of funding issues for the Australian Paralympic Federation. The Federation made an emergency appeal for funding from the public in order to cover the cost of transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. The Federation found funding through a variety of small donations that allowed Sauvage and other Australian athletes to compete.

At the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games, she won four gold medals - 400 m (T53), 800 m (T53), 1500 m (T52-53) and 1500 m (T52-53) and finished fourth in Marathon (T52-53). She won these while having an injured wrist. She set world records in the 1500 m and 5000 m events during these Games. Sauvage won the 5000 m and the 400 m golds only an hour apart. At her final Paralympics in Sydney, 2000, she won two gold medals - 1500 m and 5000 m T54 events and silver medal in 800 m T54.

===IPC Athletics World championships===
Sauvage competed at three IPC Athletics World Championships. At the 1994 Championships in Berlin, Germany, she won four gold medals in T53 events - 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and Marathon. At the 1998 Championships in Birmingham, England, she won six gold medals in 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, Marathon - T55 events, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m (T54-55). At her final Championships in 2002 at Lille, France, she won gold medal in 800 m T54 and silver medals in 1500 m and 5000 m T54.

===Road racing===
1993 was Sauvage&#x27;s first year on the international wheelchair racing circuit, competing in the US and Europe. It was also the year that she got her first kneeling wheelchair. The pinnacle being the world-famous Boston Marathon where she recorded her first victory, in the women&#x27;s wheelchair division, in 1997, breaking the stranglehold of the &#x27;Queen of Boston&#x27;, US racer Jean Driscoll. Sauvage went on to win a further three Boston titles in 1998, 1999 and 2001. She has won the Los Angeles Marathon, Honolulu Marathon and Berlin Marathon.
Sauvage won the prestigious Oz Day 10K Wheelchair Road Race ten times – 1993–1999 and 2001–2003.

===Demonstration events===
From 1993 to 2001, Sauvage won every IAAF wheelchair demonstration event at IAAF World Athletics Championships. In that same period, she also won the demonstration events for wheelchair racing in the 800 metre race at the Olympic games. The 800 metre event does not require that athletes stay in their lanes after the first turn. For this reason, athletes like Sauvage are required to wear helmets when racing. In 2000, Sauvage won the Olympic demonstration event and was expected to win the Paralympic gold. She was upset by Canadian Chantal Petitclerc. The Australian delegation appealed the result, claiming the race was not fair because another racer, Ireland&#x27;s Patrice Dockery, was disqualified for leaving her lane too early. The appeal was rejected, because Dockery was too far behind the front runners to impact the results. Sport academics who research the Paralympic Games consider this protest to be pivotal, because it shows the passion of athletes to win and the extent that sports people will go to claim gold. It also highlighted that the rivalries in the sport were real. Petitclerc said of her rivalry with Sauvage that &quot;I dream more about Louise than I do my boyfriend.&quot; In 2002, Petitclerc beat Sauvage again at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where the 800 metre event was a full medal event at the games for the first time. It was only the second time that Sauvage had lost to Petitclerc.

==Training==

Sauvage trained 10 to 14 hours a week when she was actively competing. Her training was very focused, and she attempted to make it fun to help her maintain interest. She often trained six days a week. Her training included boxing, swimming and racing between 25 and 35 km in a single session.

Frank Ponta was one of Sauvage&#x27;s first coaches. She was subsequently coached by Jenni Banks, who oversaw much of Sauvage&#x27;s development as an elite wheelchair athlete, from her first international success at the World Games in Assen in 1990, to her best ever medal tally at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Atlanta in 1996. Andrew Dawes was her coach after the 1996 Paralympics.

==Coaching career==
After her retirement from competition, she became involved in coaching young wheelchair athletes, establishing a foundation to help support children with disabilities in 2001. In 2004, Sauvage started coaching other wheelchair athletes. The first athlete that she coached was Angie Ballard. Sauvage&#x27;s coaching helped Ballard win gold 400 m and silver in the 100 m, 200 m, 800 m and 1500 m at the Summer Down Under Series in 2005.

Sauvage has attended several international competitions as a coach. She was an athletics coach with the Australian team 2008 Beijing Games and 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships. She is currently Wheelchair Track &amp; Road Elite Development Coach at the New South Wales Institute of Sport and coaches Madison de Rozario.

==Retirement==

During her retirement from being an athlete, Sauvage created a consulting company that she works for. In 2010, Sauvage was a speaker at the IPC Women in Sport Summit. She spoke alongside Amy Winters and Jayme Paris.

In February 2011, Sauvage participated in the Charter Hall Malabar Magic Ocean Swim. The event was created to raise funds for Rainbow Club. It was Sauvage&#x27;s first ocean swim. She finished the 1 km race in 25:19.

In 2011, as part of the Australian Centre for Paralympic Studies oral history project of the National Library of Australia, Ian Jobling conducted an extensive interview with Sauvage.

==Disability rights==
Sauvage and Paul Nunnar lobbied Virgin Blue during 2006 to drop a requirement that people in wheelchairs be accompanied by a carer if they wish to ride on a Virgin Blue aircraft. Previously, both athletes had tried to lobby Qantas to lift a limit of only two electric wheelchairs on domestic flights flying on Boeing 737s. The pair were ineffective because the change would have required a change in law, not in airline policy. Sauvage and Nunnar did receive an invitation to help train Qantas staff and help make staff more aware of the needs of disabled people.

==Recognition==
Sauvage was the Australian Paralympian of the Year in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998.

<text>The Hwa Chong Junior College () was a junior college in Singapore offering pre-university education. The school merged with The Chinese High School on 1 January 2005 to form the integrated Hwa Chong Institution.

==History==

===Founding===

Hwa Chong Junior College is the second junior college, and the first government-aided junior college to be established in Singapore, after National Junior College. In 1970, the then Minister for Education Ong Pang Boon approached a group of Chinese community leaders from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) to discuss establishing ten junior colleges to replace the pre-university classes in the senior high sections of The Chinese High School and other high schools in Singapore. Tan Keong Choon, a prominent businessman and the managing director of the board of The Chinese High School was appointed to oversee the project, estimated to cost S$2.2 million of which half of the total funds is to be funded by SCCCI.

After meetings and discussions, the Chinese community leaders declared to the government that due to financial constraints, they were able to raise sufficient funds for constructing only two of the originally intended ten junior colleges. Subsequently, the management board of The Chinese High School creased the school&#x27;s pre-university classes in preparation for the building of a new junior college. In 1974, Hwa Chong Junior College was inaugurated at the Bukit Timah Road campus of The Chinese High School, and was run by the same management board as the high school. The junior college&#x27;s name was an abbreviation of the high school&#x27;s Chinese name, to mark the relationship between the two schools.

Hwa Chong Junior College commenced lessons on 2 January 1974 in National Junior College, and the former Bukit Timah campus of the Singapore Management University. On 14 June 1974, the college commenced its operation at its permanent site at 661 Bukit Timah Road, located adjacent to the campus of The Chinese High School. With a cohort size of 1500 students and 88 staff, Hwa Chong Junior College was the largest junior college in Singapore in terms of enrollment. The initial facilities of the campus include a fully air-conditioned library, a multi-purpose hall, two lecture theatres of seating capacity of 300 and 500 respectively, ten laboratories and twenty-four tutorial rooms.

In the initial years, Hwa Chong Junior College offered pre-university courses in two language mediums, namely Chinese Language and English Language, before the restructuring of the education system in 1982. The uniform was designed by the pioneer batch of students, with the college crest, motto and anthem selected by the pioneering teachers. In 1981, Hwa Chong Junior College became the first junior college in Singapore to offer the Humanities Programme.

===Moving out and return to Bukit Timah===
Following the Hotel New World collapse in 1986, the school management committee ordered a review on the building structure after walls in the college was reportedly ruptured. On 8 May 1987, Hwa Chong Junior College moved out of its premises at Bukit Timah Road due to structural problems with the building. The campus was redeveloped the following year, with the Ministry of Education covering 80 per cent of cost of standard facilities for the three-year long redevelopment project, the college itself raised the remaining $7 million. Between May and December 1987, lessons were held temporarily at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Woodlands Street 81. The college shifted to Bukit Batok Street 34 (present-day site of Swiss Cottage Secondary School and St. Anthony&#x27;s Primary School) later. HCJC moved back to its Bukit Timah campus in 1992. The new building had considerable changes to the architecture style, while the octagonal layout remained in the new building. The rebuilt campus also features the largest and most comprehensive library among all junior colleges in Singapore.

Hwa Chong Junior College was one of the first junior colleges to offer the Chinese Language Elective Programme (C-LEP) along with Temasek Junior College, when the course is introduced in 1990.

===Merger with Chinese High School===

In January 2004, Hwa Chong Junior College became the first junior college in Singapore to gain independent status. On 1 January 2005, the college officially merged with The Chinese High School to form the current Hwa Chong Institution, to facilitate the running of the school&#x27;s Integrated Programme.

== Principal ==
Principals who had served the former Hwa Chong Junior College from 1974 to 2004 are as follows.

== Culture &amp; Identity ==
Hwa Chong Junior College was well known for its inclusive yet equally competitive tradition. Despite commonly mistaken as a tertiary institution with a strong emphasis on Chinese heritage (partly due to its name and student population, of which used to be dominated by students from Special Assistance Plan high schools), Hwa Chong Junior College had a very diverse culture. Malay and Tamil language subjects, as well as foreign languages such as German and French were offered to cater to students&#x27; diverse backgrounds and interests. Multi-cultural based co-curricular activities such as English drama, contemporary dance, as well as those representative of other cultures, such as Indian dance, are also featured among the college&#x27;s array of activities.

=== Crest ===
The college crest used before merger with The Chinese High School was represented by four upward arrows bounded by a horizontal bar. These arrows represents the initial streams in the college, namely Arts, Science, Technical and Commerce, as well as the educational aims of social, moral, intellectual and physical growth, together with continued advancement as indicated by the soaring arrows. The horizontal bar that holds the arrows together signifies unity and the withholding of excellence.

=== Anthem ===
The college anthem of Hwa Chong Junior College is presently the anthem for the college section of Hwa Chong Institution, sung weekly on Mondays. The anthem, written in English, reflected the ideals of the college as a multiracial environment for holistic learning and growth. A complementary anthem in Chinese was introduced with the English anthem in 1974, adopting the same chord.

=== Uniform ===
The uniform of the former Hwa Chong Junior College was designed by a Malay female student (one of the pioneer batch of students who graduated from HCJC in 1975), and is a distinct feature of HCJC. The uniform for male students comprise a beige shirt featuring two shirt pockets, an identity of the uniform, complemented with long beige trousers. The uniform for female students comprise a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The same uniform was retained as the uniform for the college section of Hwa Chong Institution.

== Campus ==
The campus of Hwa Chong Junior College is the current college compound for the integrated Hwa Chong Institution, previously separated and fenced before 2006. The iconic octagonal shaped central building of Hwa Chong Junior College is based on the basis of a divine Taoist sign. It houses facilities such as the college library, co-curricular activity (CCA) rooms, and provide ample space for student-led activities. The adjacent tutorial block houses three lecture theatres and an auditorium, as well special rooms for the humanities and language elective programmes.

Due to its iconic yellow-coloured walls and oriental architecture, Hwa Chong Junior College was also known affectionately as &quot;黄城&quot; &quot;(Chinese: Literal meaning &quot;Yellow Town&quot;)&quot;, which is deeply reflected in the literary works and composes by its students since the 1970s.

==Achievements==

Hwa Chong Junior College was consistently ranked as one of the top junior colleges in Singapore based on the official college rankings by the Ministry of Education since the 1990s. The college was consistently ranked as the top college for Arts and Commerce. The college had also been ranked as the top junior college in Singapore in terms of academic performance for its Science stream students and in overall performance for a number of times.

The college had an excellent track record in academia, sports, music, culture and the arts. Many of its graduates went on to become leaders in research, industry and government. Between 1980 and 2005, Hwa Chong had been recognized as one of the top junior colleges in Singapore, alongside others such as Raffles Junior College. Hwa Chong was also the first junior college to introduce the Humanities Scholarship Programme for students.

As at the time of merger with The Chinese High School in 2005, Hwa Chong Junior College had produced the second highest number of President&#x27;s Scholars (second only to Raffles Junior College). In addition, Hwa Chong graduates take an impressive share of government and private organization undergraduate scholarships annually. More than 15% of each graduating cohort move on to study in renowned universities worldwide, such as Harvard University and Cambridge University. Hwa Chong Junior College also had the distinction of being the top junior college for two elective programmes, namely the Humanities Programme and the Chinese Language Elective Programme.

<text>The Global Church of God (GCG) is a Sabbatarian church based in England. It was founded in Glendora, CA in 1992 by Roderick C. Meredith. Following the dissolution of most church operations in the United States, GCG&#x27;s operations shifted to the United Kingdom and reestablished a presence in North America under new organizational identities.

== History and background ==
Roderick C. Meredith had been a minister in the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) for 40 years. He established GCG in response to a number of major doctrinal shifts in WCG. GCG is one of the many Sabbatarian Churches of God to form after WCG&#x27;s 1995 schism.

Herbert W. Armstrong had founded the WCG as a radio ministry (originally called the Radio Church of God) in 1934. Over the next 50 years, the church developed an international presence through &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine, &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; radio and television programs, and three campuses of Ambassador College in the U.S. and England. The WCG taught certain controversial doctrines, including observance of selected Mosaic laws as outlined in the first five books of the Bible (similar to aspects of Judaism) but held to repentance, baptism and the testimony of Jesus Christ as taught in the New Testament.

Armstrong died in 1986 and was succeeded by Joseph W. Tkach. Under Tkach, WCG adopted a theology in line with historic and mainstream Christianity. During that period of change, many members left WCG, including many ministers who began their own churches in an effort to remain loyal to Armstrong&#x27;s teachings. GCG was just one among these Sabbatarian Churches of God.

Similar in fashion to Armstrong&#x27;s approach, Meredith and the GCG established a magazine and television program, both under the name &quot;The World Ahead&quot;.

==Governance and new affiliations==
GCG experienced an upheaval of its own after a dispute between Meredith and the church board over governance issues in 1998. More information about that upheaval, which resulted in a major split in the CGC, can be understood from &quot;An Open Letter From The Council of Elders&quot; (dated 4 Dec., 1998). In that letter, (signed by Roderick C. Meredith, Carl McNair, Richard Ames, Dibar Apartian, Charles Bryce and John Ogwyn) it stated that in late Nov. 1998, &quot;the Board of Directors made the most far-reaching decisions since the inception of Global. They had meetings which culminated with the firing of Global&#x27;s founder and Presiding Evangelist, Dr. Roderick C. Meredith.&quot; It was a dramatic action which, that letter stated, was taken totally apart from any counsel, or advice, from Global&#x27;s Council of Elders. &quot;In the bylaws of the Church it is stated that the purpose of the Council of Elders is to give advice to the Board and to the Presiding Evangelist and to help guide the overall direction of the Work in all spiritual and administration matters. At the time of these Board meetings there were eleven functioning members of the Council, five of which were also members of the Board. The Council&#x27;s membership had been reduced by two in the preceding week. This was first due to the Council&#x27;s previous action on November 11 suspending Dave Pack from the Council and secondly due to the tragic and untimely death of Colin Adair on November 15. Mr. Pack&#x27;s suspension had come after an all-day hearing ending at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, November 11. The hearing and suspension were triggered by serious charges brought against Mr. Pack by church members in Michigan. Mr. Pack was present in the room for discussion of the charges. Prior to its Wednesday adjournment the Council decided, with ten members concurring and two abstaining, to suspend Mr. Pack.

Earlier, eight members of the Council had agreed that an outright expulsion of Mr. Pack from the Council was in order. The only three men present in the room to object to Mr. Pack&#x27;s expulsion were Raymond McNair, Larry Salyer, and Edwin Pope. They were a very distinct minority in the Council meeting that Wednesday. However, when the Board met following Colin Adair&#x27;s death these three then constituted a majority of the five member Board.

When their Friday meeting began (Nov. 20), a motion was made to remove Carl McNair from the Board (though no charges of misconduct were made against him). Since the motion involved Carl McNair, he couldn&#x27;t participate in the decision and his expulsion was accomplished by agreement of three out of the four participants (Mr. Meredith strongly dissented from this action). The next decision was to fill Mr. McNair&#x27;s place by the appointment of Norbert Link, the lawyer. Total control of the Board was now gained by this tiny minority of the Council. If there was a genuine desire to abide by the spirit and intent of the bylaws, why was the Council totally bypassed and left out of the loop in this most important and far reaching of decisions?&quot;

The six Elders who signed stated that they comprised &quot;the majority of the Council of Elders as constituted at the time of the Board action&quot;. Their letter made protest that the Board&#x27;s actions were made without their advice and contrary to their wishes. They called for the &quot;minority who gained control of the corporate entity, Global Church of God, through political stratagems to step down and hand back over corporate control to Dr. Meredith and the leadership which is supported by the vast majority of ministers and members.&quot; As that was never done, Meredith found it necessary to leave and went on to form the Living Church of God, based in San Diego, California (which in 2003 was moved to Charlotte, North Carolina).

Membership in GCG declined to the point that it ceased operations under that name in the United States. Most U.S. members either affiliated with Meredith&#x27;s new church or were later absorbed into the United Church of God, which had split from WCG in 1995.

Administrative affairs for GCG shifted to the church&#x27;s office in the United Kingdom. The GCG re-established a presence in the U.S. as The Church of the Eternal God and in Canada as the Church of God, a Christian Fellowship.

Groups that formed out of the GCG breakup in 1998:
*Affiliated with the Global Church of God: 
**Church of God, A Christian Fellowship (CGCF): Formed when the U.S. operations of GCG dissolved. The CGCF later merged with the United Church of God (UCG) and likewise ceased operations in the U.S. However, CGCF&#x27;s Canadian office continued to operate in affiliation with the GCG in England. Based in Summerland, British Columbia.
**Church of the Eternal God (CEG): Led in the U.S. by a group of ministers who resisted the merger of CGCF with UCG. Based in San Diego, California, CEG is affiliated with GCG in the United Kingdom and CGCF in Canada.
*Not affiliated with the Global Church of God: 
**Restored Church of God (RCG): Led by David C. Pack and based in Wadsworth, Ohio. Publishes &quot;The Real Truth&quot; magazine and a host of booklets and publications available on the RCG website.
**Living Church of God (LCG): Led by Roderick C. Meredith, former chairman of GCG&#x27;s board. Publishes &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; magazine and produces a telecast under the same name. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
**Church of God Fellowship: Led by minister Harold Smith and based in Spokane, Washington, with an office in Canada.
**Sabbath Church of God: Led by Warren Zehrung and based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Produces &quot;The Proclamation of Jesus Christ&quot; radio program.
**Church of God, 21st Century: Was led by the late Raymond F. McNair, a former board member of both GCG and the CGCF. Based in Temecula, California.

On the western edge of town, Kaikohe Hill rises 300 m above sea level, allowing views of the imposing sand dunes on the Hokianga Harbour to the west, farmlands to the east and south toward Mount Hikurangi (625 m).

To the north of the Putahi volcanic ridge is Lake Ōmāpere, five km in length, but only two to three metres deep. Around five km to the east is the small village of Ngawha Springs, where hot water springs rise to the surface from the Ngawha geothermal field, and where the Northland Region Corrections Facility is situated.

There are several volcanic scoria cones in the area, which are part of the Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field.

==History and culture==

===Early history===
Originally a Māori village called &quot;Ōpango&quot;, Kaikohe is recognised as being the very heart of the culture of the great Ngāpuhi iwi. In the early 19th century a rival Māori tribe raided the village and fugitives subsisted among the Kohekohe (a native tree) groves on Tokareireia (Kaikohe Hill). After the incident, the village became known as &quot;Kaikohekohe&quot; (kai meaning food) but was later shortened to Kaikohe.

Battles during the Flagstaff War (also known as &#x27;Hōne Heke&#x27;s Rebellion&#x27;) were fought around Kaikohe: at Hōne Heke&#x27;s pā at Puketutu on the shores of Lake Ōmāpere; followed by a battle at Te Ahuahu; with the warriors of Te Ruki Kawiti fighting the Battle of Ōhaeawai. St. Michael&#x27;s Anglican Church in nearby Ngawha Springs was built on the site of the pā at which the battle took place. The warrior chief Hōne Heke settled in Kaikohe after fighting ceased, and died there in 1850. His grand-nephew Hone Heke Ngapua, MP for Northern Maori, also lived in Kaikohe. In April 1911, a monument to him was unveiled on Kaikohe Hill by Sir James Carroll, acting Prime Minister. A park in the town is dedicated to Rawiri Taiwhanga who has a very strong claim to being New Zealand&#x27;s first commercial dairy farmer. He milked a herd of cows and sold butter in 1834.
To the west of the town is the Aperahama Anglican Church, named after Aperahama Te Awa. It was opened in 1885, a year after his death, and he is buried in the churchyard. It is on the site of an earlier church, built in 1837, and the existing memorial gates were erected and dedicated for that earlier church. The building is registered as a place &quot;... of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value...&quot; by Heritage New Zealand.

Kaikohe was an important location for the late 19th/early 20th century kauri gum digging trade.

Also in the town is a Pioneer Village, a 19th-century Northland community recreated with all its colourful atmosphere, history and detail.

===Railway links===
Kaikohe was linked to the national rail network with the arrival of a branch line railway being built from Otiria on the North Auckland Line to Kaitaia, which opened to Kaikohe on 1 May 1914. The line continued north to Ōkaihau, opening on 29 October 1923 and eventually reached Rangiahua, although the section between Okaihau and Rangiahua was never handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department for operation and the line never reached Kaitaia. The line between Okaihau and Rangiahua was operated for a short time by the Public Works Department before being closed and dismantled during World War II. The railway through Kaikohe thus became known as the Okaihau Branch.

Although Kaikohe became the service centre of the Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic in the early years of the line. During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound, and the decline continued to the point where in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster. Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week. Two carried only freight, while four were mixed goods/passenger trains. At that time, a full complement of staff was again employed at Kaikohe.

When railcars were introduced on services north of Auckland in November 1956, they ran through Kaikohe all the way to Okaihau. Previously, a carriage train known as the Northland Express had run from Auckland to Opua with connections to Kaikohe and Okaihau via the mixed trains, but with the change of the northern terminus to Okaihau, the branch increased in importance. This proved to be short-lived; in July 1967 the popular railcar service was withdrawn due to mechanical problems plaguing the railcars. Passengers had to use the mixed trains, with significantly older rolling stock on a slower schedule. Demand decreased and the branch closed to passengers on 21 June 1976.

In 1977, a relaxation of road transport laws led to a decline in freight traffic on the line and forestry proposals that would have required a railway service failed to eventuate. Scheduled trains were cancelled beyond Kaikohe on 12 August 1983, and for a little over four years the line was shunted when required. The branch closed on 1 November 1987 and the track has been lifted. The rail corridor through Kaikohe is still owned by the New Zealand Railways Corporation, being retained in case any forestry proposals come to fruition and the railway is again required, although it now forms part of the Twin Coast Cycle Trail.

===Marae===

The Kaikohe area has three Ngāpuhi marae:

* Te Kiore Marae and Te Kiore meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Whakaminenga.
* Te Iringa or Parihaka Marae and its Parihaka meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Hinemutu and Ngāti Tautahi.
* Ōkorihi Marae is affiliated with Ngāti Hinemutu, Ngāti Tautahi and Ngāti Ueoneone; its meeting house burned down in 2003.

==Local government==
From 1876, Kaikohe was administered as part of Bay of Islands County. The town attained borough status on 1 July 1947, separating from Bay of Islands County, after a poll of Kaikohe electors saw a vote for the establishment of the borough of 207 votes in favour and 27 against. The first mayor and members of the Kaikohe Borough Council were elected on 20 August 1947. In the 1989 local government reforms, Kaikohe Borough re-amalgamated with Bay of Islands County and joined with Mangonui County, Hokianga County, Whangaroa County and Kaitaia Borough to create the Far North District. Kaikohe was selected to be the seat of the new district and the council&#x27;s main headquarters are located in the township. 

===Mayors of Kaikohe===
During the period of the Kaikohe Borough Council from 1947 to 1989, Kaikohe had at least five mayors. The following is an incomplete list:
==Attractions==
Kaikohe is the geographical centre of the Far North. Within a 50 km radius are the Bay of Islands and the Waipoua, Puketi and Omahuta kauri forests. Also not far away are the Whangaroa and Hokianga harbours, the Waiomio limestone caves, many beaches and bays, and historic Kerikeri which is Northland&#x27;s largest town. It is also the home of the Kaikohe Demolition Derby which featured in the &quot;Kaikohe Demolition&quot; movie filmed by Florian Habicht.

The Twin Coast Cycle Trail, part of the New Zealand Cycle Trail project, runs through the town.

==Notable residents==

<doc id="987885" wikidata="Q319378" url="?curid=987885" title="Memnon of Rhodes">
<text>Memnon of Rhodes (Greek: Μέμνων ὁ Ῥόδιος; 380 – 333 BC) was a prominent Rhodian Greek commander in the service of the Achaemenid Empire. Related to the Persian aristocracy by the marriage of his sister to the satrap Artabazus II, together with his brother Mentor he served the Persian king for most of his life, and played an important role during the invasion of Alexander the Great and the decades before that.

Carl Otis Schuster notes that though often inaccurately described as &quot;simply a mercenary&quot;, Memnon was arguably the toughest defender of the Persian Empire Alexander had to face, and was nearly successful in putting a halt to him.

==Biography==
===Under the governor of Phrygia===
Not much is known about Memnon&#x27;s early life. Born 380 BC in Rhodes, Memnon would serve the Achaemenid Empire for most of his life. He started his career in 358 BC by serving together with his brother Mentor under the Persian satrap (governor) Artabazos II. During his service to the Persian satrap, Artabazos II allowed Mentor to marry his daughter Barsine. Around 358 BC, Artabazos II staged a rebellion against the then ruling Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404–358), with Memnon and Mentor as his generals. When the revolt failed, Memnon and Artabazos II fled to Pella, the capital of Macedonia, whereas Memnon&#x27;s brother Mentor fled to Egypt. Eventually, Mentor returned to Persian service around 343 BC.

===In Macedon===
During his visit in Macedon, Memnon became acquainted with Philip II and the young prince Alexander (later Alexander the Great), who was seven years old at the time. According to Plutarch, Memnon and Alexander had lengthy discussions, with Alexander reportedly having keen interest in Persia&#x27;s military strength and tactics, amongst others. Though Schuster notes that the details of the conversations between Memnon and Alexander are difficult to verify, he does add that Memnon managed to get a proper impression of Philip II as a ruler, military leader and diplomat during his time in Pella. Moreover, it convinced him of Philip II&#x27;s intentions to invade Persia, and he got a proper realization of the deep-seated Greek dissatisfaction vis-a-vis the Macedonian hegemony over Greece, including the political issues that came along with it for the Macedonians.

Through the &quot;influence&quot; of his brother, after a stay of about three to four years in Macedon, Memnon re-entered the Persian service, &quot;with a clear understanding of Macedonia&#x27;s military capabilities&quot;.

===Defense of the Achaemenid Empire===
====Campaigns against Philip II====

When Mentor died 340 BC, Memnon married his widow Barsine. In 339 BC, Memnon helped to defend Byzantium against an assault by Philip II. In 336 BC, Philip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion to &#x27;free&#x27; the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip II had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip II&#x27;s death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of Memnon of Rhodes.

====Campaigns against Alexander the Great====
When Philip II&#x27;s son Alexander invaded the Achaemenid Empire in 334 BC, Memnon, aware of the political issues the Macedonians dealt with, urged king Darius III (336–330 BC) to orchestrate a rebellion in Greece and he advised the Persian satraps to lay waste to the land that Alexander would have to pass, depriving his army of food and supplies. This would make it harder for Alexander and his army to survive on their long journey before the battle. The satraps did not trust Memnon, and did not ravage their territories. Initially hesitant, Darius III made Memnon the commander of the western satrapies (provinces) after the defeat at the Battle of the Granicus. During the Siege of Halicarnassus, Memnon was the leading commander, and nearly defeated Alexander&#x27;s attack. He then started using the empire&#x27;s naval superiority against Alexander and started negotiations with Sparta in order to take the war to mainland Greece. He began a campaign to capture the Aegean islands using the Persian fleet and led a direct assault on Macedonia, while Alexander was resting at Phaselis. Memnon managed to capture the island of Chios and most of Lesbos. Demosthenes, after hearing of Memnon&#x27;s successes, began to prepare Athens for a revolt against Alexander, along with other Greek cities, while Sparta began to prepare for war. By a stroke of fortune for Alexander, Memnon died during the siege of Mytilene, after transferring command to his nephew, Pharnabazus. Memnon&#x27;s widow Barsine, according to Plutarch and Justin, later became Alexander&#x27;s mistress and allegedly bore him a son, Heracles. After Alexander&#x27;s death, Heracles contended for the throne with Nearchus&#x27; initial support (who himself had married Barsine&#x27;s daughter by Mentor). Their bid met insufficient support, and Barsine and Heracles were murdered in 309 BC by Polyperchon.

==Assessment==
Many scholars maintain that had Memnon&#x27;s campaign been successful, Alexander would have had difficulty in continuing his campaign in Asia, and might have soon been defeated. Memnon&#x27;s naval campaigns and the uprising he orchestrated in Sparta posed the greatest danger to Alexander since he had become king. Schuster notes that if Memnon had not died at Mytilene, &quot;Alexander might have been forced to abandon Asia Minor and return home to defend his throne&quot;. Thus, when Alexander realized he had nearly been defeated, he decided to invade Achaemenid Phoenicia before he moved into the empire&#x27;s interior. It was not until after the major Persian defeat at the Battle of Issus that Memnon&#x27;s strategy was revitalised and finally put into action, but by then, the advantage had been lost, and Alexander showed himself willing to forfeit Greece, if necessary, for his greater goals.

==In fiction==

* Memnon appears as an antagonist in the Japanese manga &quot;Historie&quot;, by Hitoshi Iwaaki.

<doc id="987893" wikidata="Q921422" url="?curid=987893" title="European route E6">
<text>European route E6 (, , or simply E6) is the main north–south thoroughfare through Norway as well as the west coast of Sweden. It is long and runs from the southern tip of Sweden at Trelleborg, into Norway and through almost all of the country north to the Arctic Circle and Nordkapp. The route ends in Kirkenes close to the Russian border.

== Route ==
From south to north, the E6 runs through Trelleborg, Malmö, Helsingborg, Halmstad, Gothenburg, Svinesund in Sweden, before crossing the border at the Svinesund Bridge into Norway. It then passes Halden, Sarpsborg, Moss, Vestby to the capital Oslo. North of this, it passes by Gardermoen, Hamar, Lillehammer, Dombås, Oppdal, Melhus to Trondheim.

Beyond Trondheim, the E6 meets Stjørdalshalsen, Verdalsøra, Steinkjer, Grong, Mosjøen, Mo i Rana, then over the Saltfjellet mountains. It then passes through Rognan, Fauske, and Hamarøy towards Bognes, where there is a ferry crossing over the Tysfjorden to Skarberget. It then runs through on via Narvik, Setermoen, Nordkjosbotn, Skibotn, and Alta to Olderfjord, where European route E69 continues north towards Nordkapp. The E6, meanwhile, turns south towards Lakselv and Karasjok, then runs on the west bank of the Anarjohka, which forms the border with Finland. Beyond the border, it passes through Varangerbotn, and Kirkenes, where the road terminates just east of the town centre.

Between Trelleborg and Kirkenes, there is a more than shorter route using E4 and E75, among the longest detours any European route has. In Finnmark there are several shorter alternative routes to the E6. Moreover, on the stretch from Oslo to Trondheim, following E6 strictly is a detour compared to using Norwegian National Road 3 or Norwegian National Road 4 for their applicable portions of the trip.

== Features ==

The road is a 2+2 lane motorway from outside Trelleborg to Moelv, about . The last Swedish part of the E6 motorway through Bohuslän was completed in 2015. This motorway is also connected to Central Europe by uninterrupted motorway (via E20). Some stretches further north also have four lanes or motorway standards. The rest of the road is usually wide ordinary road. Some parts in the north of Norway are less than wide, making it very tight when heavy vehicles meet. The northern half of the road, north of Trondheim, is also often fairly curvy, making high speeds a possible safety hazard.

E6 passes over treeless mountain passes in a few places in Norway. In the winter, bad weather and snow storms can cause the road to be temporarily closed, though, unlike many minor roads, it is kept open wherever practical. Because the road is the main artery through the country, cyclists and leisure travellers avoid the southern sections owing to the excessive traffic. In the north, traffic used to be sparse in 2009, but traffic numbers on E6 may have increased since the number of mobile homes in Europe has doubled, or because road trips and van life are being largely promoted on social media.

==Electronic road tolls in Norway==

Travellers driving from Svinesund, at the border between Norway and Sweden, to the other end of E6 in Kirkenes, will pass around 32 electronic toll stations on the Norwegian stretch of E6 between Svinesund and Bjerkvik. Without prior registration, the cost of a straight trip from Svinesund to Kirkenes, with a petrol or diesel car weighing less than 3500 kilos, remaining only on E6, was NOK 1072 (&quot;about €90,45&quot;) with rush hour fares included, by the end of October 2024. The last electronic toll station would be Hålogaland Bridge, between Narvik and Bjerkvik. The number of tolls to pass and pay for will however increase as soon as one drives off the E6, into cities with toll rings, either for sleeping in a hotel or for sightseeing. The number of toll stations one encounters on E6 can decrease when road projects have been paid for and toll stations are abandoned. The number of toll stations can also go up in the future if new roads need to be financed. As of October 2024, there are no electronic road tolls on E6 in Finnmark.

The Norwegian system of electronic tolls is based on the assumption that every road user has a credit card and a smartphone to register their vehicle at www.Autopass.no, a website owned by the Norwegian national road administration. There is no place or way to pay for your tolls with cash money. If the tolls aren&#x27;t paid by registering the vehicle online, a bill with a higher price will be sent to the vehicle owner&#x27;s address. It is also not possible to evade toll sections by taking smaller parallel roads. Quite a lot of foreign visitors to Norway do not understand how roads that are not motorways can even be toll roads. Others are complaining that the Norwegian road toll system works like a trap, because the amount of road toll in cities like Oslo and Trondheim tends to depend on multiple factors, like time of travelling and emission category of the vehicle, making it impossible to predict the exact price of a road trip from the Swedish border at Svinesund till Nordkapp (North Cape). Most toll calculation apps, tools, or websites will not allow you to set out a road trip that keeps you driving on E6 all along the way.

Electric cars have large discounts on tolls, but it can be fairly hard to obtain this discount with a foreign electric car. Scammers have been reported to jump on the bandwagon, by sending fake toll bills, to obtain credit card information. Increasing road tolls were also the reason for a large protest in several cities in Norway in 2018 and 2019. Norwegian authorities refuse to comment on the number of fines for unpaid tolls that they cannot collect. Public broadcaster NRK investigated and has written a long news article, in which they estimate that Norway has missed out on about 90 million Kroner (&quot;about 7,58 million Euros&quot;) between May 2021 and December 2023, because tourists have not paid their electronic road tolls. Norway cannot force drivers with foreign registered cars to pay, as long as Liechtenstein has not ratified EETS (&quot;European Electronic Toll Service&quot;), a European regulation on tolls. NRK spoke with angry locals who were contemplating on closing roads popular with tourists. NRK also spoke with Germans who had not registered their camper van, because they were told that they would get a letter with a payment request sent home into their mailbox. Norway was trying to strike deals on enforcing payment of road tolls with individual countries, to compensate for the missing EETS regulation.

== History and future plans ==
This road was called E6 in the old &quot;E&quot; road system before 1975 and previously it continued to Rome (introduced in Sweden in 1962 and Norway in 1965). However, before 1969 E6 went only to Stjørdal near Trondheim and 1969 – 1983 to Nordkjosbotn near Tromsø. The road was considered in too bad condition to be E-routes further north until it got upgraded. Parts were gravel roads. The non-E-route sections were called National Route 6 from 1965.

The northern part of E6 was first opened in 1924, when the &quot;Innlandsvegen&quot; (&quot;Inland road&quot;, in English) between Grong and Mosjøen was opened to traffic. An engineer responsible for building the &quot;Innlandsvegen&quot; wrote in his daily report of 3 February 1916 that he expected little traffic on the new road. A news report published by NRK shows that the opening ceremony picture, taken on 6 August 1924, was recreated 100 years later, after the opening of two new sections of road, between Fjerdingen and Grøndalselv and between the Trøndelag district border and the lake &quot;Lille Majavatn&quot;, with a similar picture taken on 18 October 2024. The speed limit on these 2 new straightened parts of E6 has been raised from 80 to 90 kilometres per hour (56 miles per hour). E6 was numbered RV50 between Oslo and Kirkenes in 1931, to tie the north and south of Norway more closely together, even though many road sections were still missing links. In 1991 a gate was built at the county border at Namsskogan Municipality, &quot;Nordlandsporten&quot;, to welcome travellers on E6 into northern Norway. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration, &quot;Statens Vegvesen&quot;, started the Helgelands project in 2009, a project to modernise E6 and make the road wider and safer between the county border and Saltfjellet. This project is expected to be ready by the end of 2025.

The E6 road was given the number E47 (but not signposted) in the new system on most of the Scandinavian part (Helsingborg–Olderfjord), and E6 only for the northernmost (from Olderfjord in Finnmark). After a political negotiation, the whole part passing through Scandinavia was given the number E6 in the new system, introduced in Scandinavia in 1992. The part Trelleborg-Helsingborg was never intended to be part of E47. E47 connects to E4 at the Helsingør-Helsingborg ferry, and E4 and E6 connect just outside Helsingborg.

The E6 became a 4-lane motorway all the way from Trelleborg to Kolomoen (near Hamar) in 2015, although the road is sometimes wider. The new Svinesund Bridge opened in 2005, replacing an earlier and narrower bridge from 1946. The oldest 4-lane motorway along E6 is Gothenburg-Kungälv from 1958, meaning the motorway construction through Sweden took 57 years.

Between 2012 and 2018, the road was shortened by between Narvik and Alta, by building the Hålogaland Bridge and more bridges and tunnels.

The road between Moelv and Øyer is under conversion to a 4-lane motorway, partly set to be finished around 2025, partly (including a new Mjøsa Bridge) postponed to a later year, around or after 2030.

In Trøndelag, several sections north and south of Trondheim are under construction or planned as motorways. This project is planned to be long and it will go from the junction with Norwegian National Road 3 at Ulsberg in the south to Åsen north of Trondheim Airport, Værnes, set to be finished in 2027/2028. It will be financed by &quot;Nye Veier&quot; , the Norwegian state-owned company that designs roads.

== Interruption due to snowstorms, landslides and floodings==
Apart from being the most important road between Oslo and Göteborg, E6 is functioning like Norway&#x27;s backbone, but this road is rather vulnerable to snow storms, rockfalls, landslides, flooding, bridge failures and even train wrecks on the parallel railroad. Whenever E6 is closed (&quot;stengt&quot; in Norwegian) due to any such aforementioned incident, Norwegian journalists often write that Norway is cut into two pieces (&quot;Norge er delt i to&quot;), as E6 is the only continuous road in many isolated areas in Norway; Detours around incidents in the north of Norway are often hundreds of kilometres longer than driving on E6 would be.

=== Interruption due to snow storms===

Some mountain passes along E6 in Norway are frequently closed due to snow storms in winter. These passes are:
* E6 over Saltfjellet in Nordland was closed 76 times in the winter of 2019–2020, while the average is 32 times per winter. There are no good alternative routes around this mountain road. One possibility is the coastal road with two ferries, another possibility is through Sweden (250 km longer), both the ferry and the Swedish road might be closed in storms.
* Sennalandet in Finnmark was closed 48 times in the 2019–2020 season, the record is in the 2016–2017 season, when Sennalandet had 55 closures.
* Kvænangsfjellet in Troms was closed 77 times in the winter of 2019–2020. It has been closed on average 32 times per winter due to storms. A tunnel was built under the worst part of the pass in 2024, so now this route is much more reliable.
* Dovrefjell in south Norway has the highest point along E6, 1026 metres, but it is not often closed.

=== Quick clay landslide at Finneidfjord ===

On the night from 19 to 20 June 1996, around 0h30, a large quick clay landslide took place in Finneidfjord. Two residential houses and 300 metres of E6 road disappeared into the sea. NRK came back to Finneidfjord 20 years later, interviewed people who were involved in the landslide and wrote an article to commemorate the disaster. One man, who lost his house in 1996, called the landslide an open wound, still soaring in 2016, as nobody was held responsible for the landslide. It remains unknown if blasting explosions for the building of a new tunnel in E6 have played a role in this landslide. Quick clay can be found in many places in Norway. Quick clay is normally solid but can become fluid and form landslides when under pressure or otherwise disturbed. After E6 was gone, traffic had to be diverted through Sweden, using European route E12.

=== Småröd landslide ===

On 20 December 2006, a large landslide occurred in Småröd, just south of Munkedal, in Bohuslän, in Sweden, in connection with the construction of a motorway at the site which also affected the old road. About 15 cars and a truck were involved, but no one was seriously injured. There were no good alternative routes past the site, so only narrow roads, different per direction, with long detours, were signposted as alternatives. A small road via Skredsvik, not mentioned in recommendations, was used by most local residents and also bus traffic. The Bohusbanan railway was also destroyed in the landslide. The road was reopened on 15 February 2007 and rebuilding of the railway line was finished on 24 February 2007. The Swedish Accident Investigation Authority wrote in its final report that this landslide was caused by a combination of underestimating the risks of unknown quick clay layers underground and piling up too much earth and sand, without evaluating the bearing force of the underlying earth layers.

=== Badderen bridge washed away ===

On 31 May 2022, a fairly short river bridge near Badderen was on the brink of collapse due to an unstable support column that was about to be washed away, as a result of erosion. Traffic on E6 between Tromsø and Alta had to make a longer journey to reach their destination. Inhabitants of Badderen were confronted with a detour, through Finland and Sweden, if they wished to drive their car from one river bank to the other side of the river. After traffic had been interrupted for more than a week, a temporary bridge was installed over the damaged bridge and E6 was reopened for traffic on 8 June 2022.

A final report about the causes of the collapse of Badderen bridge was published in December 2022. Stetens Vegvesen admitted that they could have done better in inspecting bridges with support columns in the middle of the river for erosion. On 30 January 2023, Statens Vegvesen announced that they would set up another temporary bridge a little upstream, where the old E6 once used to be, so the damaged bridge could be dismantled, before melting snow would cause new high water levels in the river. A design for the new Badderen bridge was published for public hearings in September 2024. It is expected that a new permanent bridge over &quot;Badderelva&quot; (&quot;elva&quot; means &quot;river&quot;) will not open before 2025.

=== Quick clay landslide at Stenungsund junction ===
On 23 September 2023, a large landslide destroyed a section of about of the highway, near Stenungsund, north of Gothenburg. The landslide also destroyed a local road, a fuel station, a fast food restaurant and a hardware store. Parked trucks got trapped in crevasses around the fuel station. The pre-1990 E6 through Ucklum was used while the motorway was closed. Shortly before King Carl XVI Gustaf arrived to cut the ribbon, on 3 July 2024, and declare the route reopened, a truckload of rotting salmon was cleared away from the site of the landslide. E6 motorway was finally reopened to traffic on 5 July 2024, several months ahead of the previous schedule, that was aiming for December 2024.

=== Train wreck on E6 near Finneidfjord ===

On 24 October 2024, around 14h15 (&quot;2h15 PM&quot;) a train on the &quot;Nordlandsbanen&quot; railway line crashed into a rock that had fallen on the tracks. According to VG newspaper, there were 46 passengers and 3 staff members on board of the train, so 49 persons in total, although some foreign media reported 55 people in the train. The train derailed, sliding down an embankment, towards the road below, which is the E6. Train driver Rolf Henry Ankersen was killed in this accident. Four passengers had to go to hospital. The rest of the passengers escaped with minor bruises and were evacuated by bus. The locomotive&#x27;s front end, some trees and smaller rocks ended up on the northbound lane of the E6, between Bjerka and Finneidfjord. Police have closed both Nordland Line and E6, because there were some fears that the locomotive and one or more train cars could slide further down the embankment, or more rocks would fall.

Once again, Norway&#x27;s main road was closed and Norway was cut in two. One detour, using FV17, involved a ferry ship crossing between Levang and Nesna, where waiting times were very long, as the ferry ship did not have enough capacity to absorb the volume of traffic that usually drives on E6.
The other option for a detour went along FV73 in Norway and through Sweden, following LV-AC1116 and European route E12. Both detours cost lots of extra fuel and driving time. The detour through Sweden, for driving from Bjerka to Finneidfjord, was about 325 km long and took around 4½ hours, compared to a 5 km drive that would take just 4 minutes under normal circumstances. A local couple started to use their fishing boat to transport people from the village over the fjord, past the train wreck. Eventually the local council took over this ferry service. Postal service &quot;Posten&quot; announced on Wednesday 30 October 2024 that letters and packages were delayed, due to many closed railways and roads. NRK published an article about at least 5 disturbances due to the closure of E6: 
* 1) Widerøe&#x27;s airplanes got delayed, because the airport in Mo i Rana could no longer supply enough fuel for non-stop flights, so extra stop over landings were needed;
* 2) Coop&#x27;s grocery shops were struggling to get food stocks delivered in time;
* 3) A meat factory in Bjerka had to lay off staff, or find alternative rooms for their seasonal workers who would normally be sleeping in Finneidfjord;
* 4) Letters and parcels sent by mail were one or 2 days late; and
* 5) Truck drivers got into trouble, because the long detours they had to make were not matching with the legal requirement to respect their maximum driving time and take enough breaks and nightly rest. This contributed much to the delivery problems.

On top of the closing of E6, both detours have also been closed at times, due to bad weather and traffic accidents. Storm Jakob, which triggered red alerts south of Trondheim, has aggravated the landslide risk and delayed the removal of the crashed locomotive at Finneidfjord. An orange alert was issued locally, with a warning not to travel if not necessary. During this episode of bad weather both detours failed on 29 October 2024, when the ferry service between Nesna and Levang was interrupted for several hours and the detour through Sweden was temporarily blocked by a truck that needed to be salvaged. E12 got covered in deep snow and long traffic jams started to form at the Swedish-Norwegian border. When the ferry between Nesna and Levang resumed its service, they were sailing with only one ship, since the second ferry ship had technical issues. The E12 detour road was closed again on Thursday 31 October 2024, after a car with three Norwegians crashed into the back of a stopped truck, on &quot;Blå Vägen&quot; (E12), between Bredviken and Kåtaviken, in Sweden. One of them died in hospital a few days later, as a result of his injuries.

At first, Statens Vegvesen had been rather optimistic in their announcement about reopening E6, but work at the train crash site took much longer than expected. All that BaneNOR had managed to do by Wednesday, 30 October 2024, was clearing the fallen rock from the train track and towing three train cars, that had not gone down the embankment, back to Bjerka railway station. Statens Vegvesen issued a new press release almost every day, keeping previous statements online.
 
 With each announcement, reopening of E6 was further delayed, due to a moving mountain slope, dangerously high winds, rockfall and other safety issues. BaneNOR chose to continuously update their existing press statement from Monday 28 October 2024 onwards, making previous versions disappear. E6 was first reopened from Friday 1 November 2024 till Sunday morning 3 November 2024. By 17h49 (&quot;5h49 PM&quot;) on Sunday 3 November 2024 BaneNOR announced that weather conditions unexpectedly had allowed them to lift one of the two train cars from the embankment above the E6, which took about 30 minutes, but as the wind was picking up, it was deemed unsafe to continue the salvage operation. Statens Vegvesen decided to temporarily reopen E6 again, starting from Sunday evening, 21h (&quot;9h PM&quot;), because traffic conditions on the detour road through Sweden had become so bad, that taking the detour through Sweden was no longer recommended. 
The second train car was lifted away on Monday morning and the locomotive was salvaged on Tuesday. Statens Vegvesen had planned for E6 to remain closed until Thursday, but with the train wreck gone, E6 was reopened for traffic under guidance on Wednesday morning, 6 November 2024. BaneNOR however announced in their last update of their press release that they expect to be doing repair works until the end of November 2024, so traffic on E6 can be temporarily closed for up till half an hour, whenever repair works on the railway might cause risk of rockfall. Train traffic was restored on Saturday the 30th of November 2024 and the traffic restrictions on E6 were lifted, 51 days after the train crash near Finneidfjord.

=== Alternative routes at interruptions along E6 ===
For drivers who drive along the E6, interruption of E6 will cause the need to select another road. At some places interruptions will cause need for long detours. Examples include:
*Between Trelleborg and Dombås there are alternative roads, often the old road used before the present fast road was built. The high amount of traffic might not fit along the alternative road.
*Between Dombås and Trondheim there are also alternative roads, however sometimes needing fairly long detours for drives which normally would be short along E6, in particular the Dovrefjell mountain pass.
*Between Trondheim and Steinkjer, an interruption just north of Stjørdal has no local alternative road. A ferry from Trondheim across the fjord, or 150 km longer through Sweden are the only options. A new road is being built here, to be opened 2027, keeping the old road as alternative.
*Between Steinkjer and Mosjøen, an interruption just north of Namsskogan has only a road near Brønnøysund which includes a ferry as alternative, or a 300 km detour through Sweden
*Between Mosjøen and Mo i Rana, an interruption south of Mo i Rana has only the road past Nesna with a ferry as alternative, or a 80 km long detour (measured from Trofors south of Mosjøen) through Sweden. This interruption scenario happened at Finneidfjord in October 2024.
*Between Mo i Rana and Fauske, the road over the Saltfjellet mountain pass or near it has no local alternative road. This mountain pass is frequently closed in winter. Alternatives include the 169 km longer road 17 through Glomfjord, which however has two ferries, of them one with very low capacity, only up to ten trips per day and 50 minutes travel time. The other alternative is through Sweden, 390 km longer.
*Between Fauske and Narvik, there is between Fauske and Drag no alternative road at all, except through Sweden, 560 km longer. There are plans to build a new road here and have the old narrow road as alternative. Between Drag and Narvik there are alternative routes with a ferry, although E6 has a ferry anyway here.
*Between Narvik and Olderdalen, there are alternative roads usable at interruptions.
*Between Olderdalen and Alta, the only alternative road is the E8-E45 road through Finland, which is 170 km longer. The Badderen bridge failure in May 2022 activated this scenario. The mountain pass Kvænangsfjellet was frequently closed, but a tunnel was opened 2024, creating along 15 km a much more reliable road with the old road as alternative.
*Between Alta and Narvik there are alternative roads, although giving fairly long detours for some drives including the Sennalandet mountain pass.

<doc id="987894" wikidata="Q7046803" url="?curid=987894" title="Noel's House Party">
<text>Noel&#x27;s House Party is a BBC light entertainment series that was hosted by Noel Edmonds. Set in a large house in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, leading to much innuendo, it ran from 23 November 1991 to 20 March 1999 on BBC One and was broadcast live on Saturday evenings for eight series. The show, once described by a senior corporation executive as &quot;the most important show on the BBC&quot;, was cancelled in February 1999 due to declining ratings, although two further compilation specials were shown in March 2000.

In 2010, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; was voted the best Saturday night TV show of all time. In August 2022, an episode of the show, the tenth episode of the first series (originally broadcast on 1 February 1992), was repeated on BBC Four. This marked the first time since 2000 that the show has been broadcast on the BBC. In July 2024, it was announced that the show would get another repeat on BBC Four, on 3 August, showing the nineteenth episode of the third series (originally broadcast on 5 March 1994).

==History==
&quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; was the successor to &quot;The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow&quot;, carrying over some of its regular features such as the &#x27;Gunge Tank&#x27;, the &#x27;Gotcha Oscar&#x27; and &#x27;Wait Till I Get You Home&#x27;.

The show had many celebrity guests posing as residents of Crinkley Bottom, including Frank Thornton and Vicki Michelle. It gave birth to Mr Blobby in the Gotcha segment. There was also a contrived rivalry between Edmonds and Tony Blackburn. One-off celebrity appearances included Michael Crawford as Frank Spencer, who came in to find the whole audience dressed as Frank after Troon comedian Stuart Henderson had performed as Frank singing The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and Ken Dodd in a highwayman&#x27;s outfit—&quot;going cheap at the Maxwell sale&quot;—as Noel&#x27;s long-lost &#x27;twin&#x27;, Berasent Edmonds (a play on Bury St Edmunds).

After several changes, the show began to decline in popularity. Its theme tune was changed in 1996, and set redesigns followed. The episode due to be broadcast on 3 January 1998 had to be cancelled after a disagreement between Edmonds and the BBC. The budget had been cut by 10%, with the money saved being used to help fund the BBC digital switchover. Edmonds reportedly walked out, claiming the show was &quot;of a poor standard and cobbled together&quot;.

The BBC cancelled the show in February 1999 after ratings plummeted from a high of 15 million to 8 million. Edmonds closed the final episode of &quot;House Party&quot; on 20 March 1999 by saying:
He was then playfully attacked with a fire extinguisher by Freddie Starr. The closing credits were followed by a brief comic skit of Edmonds&#x27; 1970s children&#x27;s show &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;, in which a seemingly young Noel wakes from a dream in the &quot;Swap Shop&quot; studio—recounting the events to Keith Chegwin and John Craven of a typical &quot;House Party&quot; episode, suggesting that the entire run of &quot;House Party&quot; never really happened—until Mr Blobby appears in the &quot;Swap Shop&quot; studio.

In a statement, Edmonds said: 

He partly blamed the Ronan Keating talent show &quot;Get Your Act Together&quot; broadcast in early 1999, for poor ratings leading into &quot;House Party&quot;, which improved when the BBC made Big Break the lead in towards the end of its run.

===Awards===
In 1993, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; won a BAFTA for best light entertainment series.

In 1994, the opening titles won a Bronze Rose of Montreux. The stop-motion animation title and credit sequences were made by 3 Peach Animation.

==Regular features==

===Gotcha===
Originally called the &#x27;Gotcha Oscars&#x27; until the threat of legal action from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (which also prompted a redesign of the award), where hidden camera practical jokes were played on celebrities (these were pre-recorded during the months the show was off air). Notable victims were Barbara Windsor, Carol Vorderman, Jill Dando, Kriss Akabusi, Lionel Blair, Dave Lee Travis, Richard Whiteley, Eddie Large, Samantha Janus, Yvette Fielding, Status Quo, and the Queens Park Rangers football club. In the final episode of series 5, Dale Winton turned the tables on Edmonds with a surprise challenge that ended with a gunging. Another notable victim was Annabel Giles, the first victim who managed to spot the hidden camera, which had been placed in the back of a car, which meant the prank backfired. This feature originated in The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow.

===Wait Till I Get You Home===
Parents watch pre-recorded clips of their children being interviewed by Edmonds, and try to guess the children&#x27;s answers. In series 5, it was replaced with Wait Till We All Get Home, but was then axed for series 6 and not replaced. It did however make a one-off return in the final episode. This complete segment was pre-recorded some months before each series of the show began, and originated in The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow.

===The Lyric Game===
In series 1, celebrity duos competed against one another to complete the lyrics of a song after being given the first line. This feature was originally in &quot;The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow&quot;. In series 2, members of the public had to guess the name of the song from the lyrics, but this was replaced in series 3 with the panel game.

===Grab a Grand===
A phone-in competition where a viewer chose from three currencies (aiming to select the greatest value of money: £1,000 in the first two episodes), and a celebrity (usually a sports star like Graham Gooch, Frank Bruno, Kathy Tayler, Kriss Akabusi, Nick Gillingham, Henry Cooper, Stephen Hendry, Steve Davis, David Gower, Gary Lineker, John Regis, Paul Gascoigne, John Barnes, Lennox Lewis, and others) would climb into a perspex box containing a fan and a large quantity of banknotes selected by the call-in contestant. The celebrity had to grab as many of the notes as possible as they were blown around by the fan.

Before the game starts, a chosen player is picked from the call in contestants who got a question correct during the show or from a previous week&#x27;s show to be picked, there would be three different bundles of money, usually two known countries and one bundle known as the &quot;Crinkley Bottom Groats&quot; which was pegged to a generally random country, all valued within £1,000, sometimes more or sometimes less. Noel would ask the caller three questions based on that week&#x27;s news. Each correct answer gave the celebrity 20 seconds in the box (up to a total of 60 seconds) accompanied by music and the audience counting down from ten to one.

The format was changed slightly in series 4, in which the caller could choose a member of the studio audience to do the &quot;grand grabbing&quot; (the audience member would win the same amount of money the caller won). A few quirks were also added in, including some modified moments: balloons inside the box, the walls falling down, allowing audience members to help, the door jammed, cheating, the machine broken, being flipped for Number Cruncher and inside a woman&#x27;s house when NTV happened.

Then, in the first episode of Series Five, the box was blown up live during the show and the segment was revamped with the entire studio audience now playing grabbing notes that were being blown around by two large industrial fans as the celebrity would run into to collect, rather than having the three currencies, instead it featured the groats as the main currency, mixed within the groats would be &quot;Golden Groats&quot; worth £50 each if collected.

There was also an incident when one of the callers had the same name, but it turned out it was not the person who had called in: the real call-in contestant had their Grab a Grand game at the start of the next episode, as this one featured the grab a grand around the grand house track. Towards the end of series 5, variations were introduced: &#x27;Grab a Granny&#x27;, &#x27;Grab a Grand Piano&#x27;, and &#x27;Grab a Grand National&#x27; etc. The money was quickly counted on stage using a Cashmaster counting machine. The last Grab a Grand was done on the last episode of series 5 (coincidentally, the 100th episode).

Grab a Grand was then replaced with Cash for Questions in series 6, nothing in series 7, and Sofa Soccer in series 8.

===NTV===
A camera was hidden in the home of a member of the public and Edmonds would talk to them through their television. Some would be shocked, other bemused, others would simply try to run away. Whatever the reaction, they would subsequently end up doing some embarrassing performance in their living room or garden. Celebrity victims included Chris Evans, Garry Bushell and Dale Winton. The feature was given a twist in the final series, becoming NTV: YOYO (You&#x27;re On Your Own).

===The Gunge Tank===
Carried over from &quot;The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow&quot;, the gunge tank was put to various uses, usually gunging celebrities or unpopular members of the public after a phone vote was carried out during the show. Gunging usually took place in the final minutes of the show.

The &#x27;gunge&#x27; was a food-thickening agent called Natrosol, coloured with various food dyes. The gunge tank got progressively more sophisticated. From series 1 a standard tank was used, with an ornate look to it. Series 2 introduced foam (often coloured) which would rise up from the bottom and cover the victim prior to the gunging. Series 3 introduced the &#x27;Car Wash&#x27;, where the individual was carried along a lengthier tank getting covered in foam then going through a set of brushes designed to soak the victim, then having the gunge descend from above before being spun out of the contraption. In series 4 and 5, it was developed into the &#x27;Trip Around The Great House&#x27;, where the victim was placed on a miniature railway that took them on a journey around the set, finishing up in the giant fireplace, where gunge was finally released onto the victim. From series 6, there were changes to the format, and gunge was used less frequently; there was also a rubbish truck with a seat that would release different rotten foods and then as the chair carried on, gunge was released on them. Series 7 did not include any type of gunge due to a refurbishment in the house. For series 8, a member of the audience would be gunged by a tank lowered from the studio rafters, or their chair would be lowered into the undercroft of the seating area (where they were gunged) and came back up again.

Edmonds himself often got gunged, usually in the last episode of a series.

===The Big Pork Pie===
The Big Pork Pie was a regular feature from series 3 where a member of the audience with an embarrassing secret was seated in a big pork pie, made to wear a lie detector and questioned by Noel. Noel himself was subjected to this on one episode, with Bob Monkhouse taking on the role of question master; it was revealed that Noel&#x27;s middle name was Ernest.

===Number Cruncher===
A regular feature for series 4 and 5, where a phone box modified to contain a gunge tank and a TV screen was placed somewhere in Britain. The code to get into the phone box was broadcast live on air, and the first viewer to reach the phone box got to play a game. Once inside, they had 45 seconds to rearrange a code on the screen to win a prize and get out again. If they ran out of time, they were covered in gunge. If they solved the puzzle, they had an opportunity to gamble their prize. By pulling a handle, they could either double their money, have random objects dropped on them, or be covered in gunge.

===Beat Your Neighbour===
One of the main features on series 5, in which two neighbours would run round to each other&#x27;s house and, in one minute, grab as many belongings as they wanted. Then, following a series of alternate questions, one neighbour would win everything, including their own stuff back. However the feature was disliked by the viewers and was only played 4 times.

=== Hot House ===
A pair of top athletes were pitted against each other in a fitness test throughout series 6.

===Cash for Questions===
For series 6 only, similar to Grab a Grand.

The first part of the game would be a qualifying question or clue this would be supplied by the professor (Portrayed by Brian Blessed). The professor is given a probe camera and sticks it into random objects (ie a loofah). The second part features a Wheel of Fortune being spun. A person from the audience is strapped horizontally to a wheel (normally someone committing an embarrassing thing). The wheel stops spinning and points to one of eight section and phones. The person on the other end of that phone has to get a question correct. If they get it wrong, the wheel is re-spun. However, if they get it correct then they are given a further three current affairs questions. Each correct answer is worth twenty seconds for B-list celeb to go crazy in the Basement.

In the third part, The Basement is pitch black and the caller, with infra-red camera at their disposal, tries to guide the person through the basement collecting bags of money along the way. Each one was worth £100, with golden ones worth £500. At the end of the time the lights came on, so there was nothing stopping the celebrity grabbing an extra bag or two on the way out. Named after a political scandal.

===My Little Friend===
My Little Friend was a pre-recorded feature used from series 6 to 8. This involved small school children being faced with puppets that start talking to them (one voiced by Noel and another by Barry Killerby). In series 7, it was aliens; in the final series, Phibber the Frog and Waffle the Squirrel spoke to the children and sometimes scared them away.

===The Secret World of the Teenager===
For series 7, a teenage version of Wait Till I Get You Home. This segment was pre-recorded.

===Crinkley Bottom: The Soap===
In first half of series 7, there was Crinkley Bottom: The Soap - a short-lived pre-recorded soap opera chronicling village life.

===Panel Beaters===
A celebrity panel game from the second half of series 7, in which celebrities had to spot the imposter from three members of the public with apparently bizarre occupations. If they failed, they got gunged. If they guessed correctly, the three members of the public were gunged instead.

===Sofa Soccer===
In the final series, a similar idea to Bernie the Bolt in &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;, a viewer at home would attempt to score goals by directing a machine to fire a huge football. The commands were &#x27;left&#x27;, &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;shoot&#x27;. Each goal was worth £400, a maximum of £2,000 could be won if five goals were scored. The music used for this game was based on &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; by The Osmonds.

===Three to Go===
A game from towards the end of series 8. Noel would link up with three regional news programmes, who would each bring an improbable-sounding news story from their region. The contestants would have to guess whether the stories were true or false.

==Mr Blobby==

In 1992, during series 2 of &quot;House Party&quot;, the character Mr Blobby was introduced as a way for Noel Edmonds to play practical jokes on celebrities. The success of the character resulted in a large amount of merchandise, public appearances and even theme parks based around the character. Mr Blobby was portrayed by Barry Killerby.

Mr Blobby was dropped from the show after series 7, but made a surprise reappearance in the final ever episode. During that episode, he ordered Edmonds to confess that dropping him from the show was a mistake, telling Edmonds to say &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess if I hadn&#x27;t sacked him.&quot;

==Crinkley Bottom Theme Parks==

With the House Party set in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, Edmonds opened three Crinkley Bottom attractions at pre-existing theme parks in the UK. The first, based at Cricket St Thomas in Somerset, featured many Mr Blobby attractions and was due to include a replica of the Great House from the series. The park closed in 1998 following dwindling attendance figures.

In 1994, a Crinkley Bottom theme park opened in Morecambe. It closed 13 weeks after opening. A two-year investigation by the district auditor was started due to the investment of £2 million by Lancaster City Council. It resulted in both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats withdrawing from the cabinet, leaving four councillors from Morecambe Bay Independents and the Green Party running the authority. A third Crinkley Bottom theme park was based at Pleasurewood Hills in Lowestoft, but has since closed.

<doc id="987898" wikidata="Q468872" url="?curid=987898" title="The Fool (design collective)">
<text>The Fool were a Dutch design collective and band in the psychedelic style of art in British popular music in the late 1960s. They worked closely with The Beatles in London, painting George Harrison&#x27;s Mini car, John Lennon&#x27;s piano and a three story high psychedelic mural on the outside of the Apple Boutique on Baker Street (since painted over). The group was named in reference to the Fool tarot card.

The original members were Dutch artists (1 February 1939 – 28 February 2020) and (born 6 November 1943), who were discovered by photographer Karl Ferris among the hippie community on the Spanish island of Ibiza in 1966. He took photographs of clothes they designed, and sent them to London where they were published in &quot;The Times&quot;. Ferris took The Fool back to London, and together they opened a studio, with the Dutch artists producing clothes and art, and Ferris pursuing photography. Barry Finch (10 April 1943 - 11 May 2021), a maverick public relations man in the music scene, discovered the couple&#x27;s talents and working for Brian Epstein got them their first designer deals in the industry. When the offers kept coming, Marijke Koger insisted that Josje Leeger (25 September 1943 - 4 July 1991), her best friend and a fashion designer with whom she had collaborated in Amsterdam, come over to join the two. Barry and Yosha Finch became a couple and so The Fool was born.

==Works==
Their work includes:
*the colourful clothes worn by the Hollies on the cover of their 1967 album &quot;Evolution&quot;;
*stage costumes and the front cover design for the self-titled 1968 debut LP &quot;Move&quot; by the Move;
*stage costumes for Procol Harum;
*the cover of the Incredible String Band&#x27;s 1967 LP &quot;The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion&quot;;
*cover art for Boudewijn de Groot&#x27;s 1968 Psych-folk LP &quot;Picknick&quot; (credited to Simon &amp; Marijke);
*stage costumes and decoration to instruments used by Cream, including Eric Clapton&#x27;s famed Gibson SG guitar (also named The Fool), Jack Bruce&#x27;s Fender Bass VI bass, and Ginger Baker&#x27;s drum kit, created for the group&#x27;s 1967 tour of the US.
*several illustrations in the magazine &quot;Oz&quot;

The Fool&#x27;s best known artworks are those they created for the Beatles in 1966–67. They include:
* the clothes worn in the 1967 television broadcast of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;;
* the clothes worn in the &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; segment of the 1967 &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; television film;
* the three-storey mural painted in psychedelic colours on the facade of the Beatles&#x27; Apple Boutique in London&#x27;s Baker Street (which also stocked their creations; months later, the mural was painted over by civic order, due to protests from other local businesses, before the shop failed);
* decoration to John Lennon&#x27;s piano and one of his Gibson acoustic guitars;
* decoration to George Harrison&#x27;s Mini car and his bungalow Kinfauns in Surrey, as well as several of Harrison&#x27;s guitars, but not his Fender Stratocaster known as &quot;Rocky&quot; which Harrison painted himself;
* the set design for Joe Massot&#x27;s 1968 movie &quot;Wonderwall&quot;;
* the graphics in the disc-inner sleeve of the 1967 &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; LP.

After moving to Los Angeles, the Fool created the largest mural in the world at the time (1968) on the exterior of the Aquarius Theatre for a production of the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;, by invitation of producer Michael Butler. Simon and Marijke went on to paint other theaters where &quot;Hair&quot; was playing, in San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago. Thereafter, The Fool split up, Simon, Barry and Josje eventually going back to Amsterdam while Marijke remained in Los Angeles to continue her artistic endeavors.

==Musical career==

The Fool also released an eponymous album &quot;The Fool&quot; in 1968, in the psychedelic folk style, produced by Graham Nash. It was re-released in 2005.

As Seemon &amp; Marijke they released another album called &quot;Son of America&quot; on A &amp; M records, also produced by Graham Nash, in collaboration with Booker T. Jones, in 1969. Backing vocals were provided by Joni Mitchell, Rita Coolidge, Morreen Thornton and Colleen Fortune. Their second single &quot;I saw you&quot; was a hit in the Netherlands in 1972.

Seemon &amp; Marijke recorded a third album called &quot;Mediterranean Blues&quot; produced by Booker T. Jones in his Homegrown Studio in 1972.

<text>The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells that was first published in 1904. Wells called it &quot;a fantasia on the change of scale in human affairs. ... I had hit upon [the idea] while working out the possibilities of the near future in a book of speculations called &quot;Anticipations&quot; (1901)&quot;.

The novel, which has had various B-movie adaptations, is about a group of scientists that invents food that accelerates the growth of children and turns them into giants when they become adults.

==Plot summary==
===Book I: The Discovery of the Food===
Research chemist Mr. Bensington specialises in &quot;the More Toxic Alkaloids&quot;, and Professor Redwood studies reaction times and takes an interest in &quot;Growth&quot;. Redwood&#x27;s suggestion &quot;that the process of growth probably demanded the presence of a considerable quantity of some necessary substance in the blood that was only formed very slowly&quot; causes Bensington to begin searching for such a substance. After a year of research and experiment, he finds a way to make what he calls in his initial enthusiasm &quot;the Food of the Gods&quot; but later more soberly dubs Herakleophorbia IV. Their first experimental success is with chickens that grow to about six times their normal size on an experimental farm at Hickleybrow, near Urshot, Kent.

Mr. and Mrs. Skinner, the couple hired to feed and monitor the chickens, eventually allow Herakleophorbia IV to enter the local food chain, and the other creatures that get the food grow to six or seven times their normal size: not only plants, but also wasps, earwigs, and rats. The chickens escape and overrun a nearby town. Bensington and Redwood do nothing until a decisive and efficient &quot;well-known civil engineer&quot; of their acquaintance, Cossar, arrives to organize a party of eight (&quot;Obviously!&quot;) to destroy the wasps&#x27; nest, hunt down the monstrous vermin and burn the experimental farm to the ground.

As debate ensues about the substance, popularly known as &quot;Boomfood&quot;, children are being given the substance and grow to enormous size: Redwood&#x27;s son (&quot;pioneer of the new race&quot;), Cossar&#x27;s three sons, and Mrs. Skinner&#x27;s grandson, Caddles. Dr. Winkles makes the substance available to a princess, and there are other giants as well. The massive offspring reach about 40 feet in height. At first, the giants are tolerated, but as they grow further, restrictions are imposed.

In time, most of the English population comes to resent the young giants, as well as changes to flora, fauna and the organisation of society that become more extensive with each passing year. Bensington is nearly lynched by an angry mob and subsequently retires from active life to Mount Glory Hydrotherapeutic Hotel.

===Book II: The Food in the Village===
Mrs. Skinner&#x27;s grandson, Albert Edward Caddles, becomes an epitome of &quot;the coming of Bigness in the world&quot;.

===Book III: The Harvest of the Food===
A man is released from prison after having been incarcerated for 20 years is shocked by how much everything has changed. British society has learned to cope with occasional outbreaks of giant pests (mosquitoes, spiders, republicans etc.), but the coming to maturity of the giant children brings a rabble-rousing politician, Caterham, nicknamed &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, into power. Caterham has been promoting a program to destroy the Food of the Gods, hints that he will suppress the giants and now begins to execute his plan.

By coincidence, it is at that moment that Caddles rebels against spending his life working in a chalk pit and sets out to see the world. In London, he is surrounded by thousands of tiny people and confused by everything that he sees. He demands to know what it is all for and where he fits in, but no one can answer his questions. After refusing to return to his chalk pit, Caddles is shot and killed by the police.

Meanwhile, a romance between the young giant Redwood and the princess blossoms just as Caterham, who has at last attained a position of power, launches an effort to suppress the giants. However, after two days of fighting, the giants, who have taken refuge in an enormous pit, have held their own. Their bombardment of London with shells containing large quantities of Herakleophorbia IV forces Caterham to call a truce.

Caterham employs Redwood &quot;père&quot; as an envoy to send a proposed settlement, whose terms would demand that the giants live apart somewhere and forgo the right to reproduce. The offer is rejected at a meeting of the giants, and one of Cossar&#x27;s sons expresses a belief in growth as part of the law of life: &quot;We fight not for ourselves but for growth, growth that goes on for ever. Tomorrow, whether we live or die, growth will conquer through us. That is the law of the spirit for evermore. To grow according to the will of God!&quot; The world ends up on the verge of a long struggle between the &quot;little people&quot; and the Children of the Food.

==Film, television and theatrical adaptations==
Bert I. Gordon adapted the work to the movies twice. He first co-wrote, produced and directed &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; (1965) for Embassy Pictures. In this film, the substance, called simply &quot;Goo&quot;, is developed by an 11-year-old (Ron Howard) and is consumed by a gang of teenaged troublemakers (led by Beau Bridges), who become giants and take over the town and turn the tables on the knee-high adults. They are eventually defeated by other teens (led by Tommy Kirk).

&quot;The Food of the Gods&quot; was released by American International Pictures in 1976 and was again written, produced, and directed by Gordon. Based on a portion of the book, it reduces the tale to an &quot;ecology strikes back&quot; scenario, then common in science fiction films. The movie was not very successful and received a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Rodent Movie of All Time, &quot;beating&quot; such competitors as &quot;The Killer Shrews&quot; (1959), &quot;The Mole People&quot; (1956), &quot;The Nasty Rabbit&quot; (1965) and &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot; (1972).

In 1989, &quot;Gnaw: Food of the Gods, Part 2&quot; was released, written by Richard Bennett and directed by Damian Lee. Dealing with a pack of giant lab rats wreaking havoc on a college campus, it is even further removed from the book than Gordon&#x27;s attempts.

==Comic book adaptions==
&quot;The Food of the Gods&quot; was first adapted for the comics in January 1961 for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; #160 with a painted cover by Gerald McCann, script by Alfred Sundel and interior artwork by Tony Tallarico. The giant wasps are depicted in only two panels, and the giant rats do not appear at all.

A more dynamic and dramatic version, &quot;told in the mighty Marvel manner&quot;, features in &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; #22 (Marvel Comics 1977), written by Doug Moench with art by Sonny Trinidad.

&quot;Deadly Muffins&quot; in &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #13 (DC Comics 1973) is an uncredited version of the story written by John Albano and drawn by Alfredo Alcala.

<text>Sri Lankabhimanya Dingiri Banda Wijetunga (; ; 15 February 1916 – 21 September 2008) was the fourth President of Sri Lanka from 7 May 1993 to 12 November 1994, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 3 March 1989 to 7 May 1993 and the Governor of North Western province, Sri Lanka from 1988 to 1989. He was awarded Sri Lankabhimanya, Sri Lanka&#x27;s highest civilian award in 1993 by President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

==Early life and education==
Wijetunga was born on 15 February 1916 to Wijethunga Mudiyanselage Delgahapitiya Arachchila and his wife Manamperi Mudiyanselage Palingumanike Manamperi, as the eldest child in a middle-class Kandyan Govigama Sinhala Buddhist family living on the outskirts of the then Udunuwara parliamentary seat in the Kandy District of the Central Province in Sri Lanka. He completed his primary education at Waligalla Central College and thereafter moved on to St Andrew&#x27;s College in Gampola.

==Early career==
After completing his schooling, he joined Ceylon Police as a constable in 1939 and served in Borella, Fort and Maradana and left service in 1942. Subsequently, he joined the Co-operative Department as a Co-operative Inspector thereafter from 1947 to 1959.

==Political career==
He was closely associated with veteran politicians like George E. de Silva and A. Ratnayaka. A. Ratnayake who was then Minister of Food and Co-operatives in the D.S. Senanayake Cabinet took him as his Private Secretary.

He joined the United National Party in 1946 and unsuccessfully contested the Kadugannawa electorate in the 1956 general election, the Yatinuwara electorate in the March 1960 general election and the Udunuwara electorate in the July 1960 general election. He entered parliament for the first time when he successfully contested the Udunuwara electorate at the 1965 general election.

He lost the Udunuwara electorate in 1970, but was returned to Parliament in the 1977 UNP landslide, being appointed Cabinet Minister of Information and Broadcasting in the J.R. Jayewardene administration. During this regime, Wijetunga functioned in various ministerial capacities holding the portfolios of Posts and Telecommunication, Power, Highways and Agricultural Development.

He served briefly as the Governor of North Western province in 1988 before returning to Parliamentary politics a few months later. In the last general election he contested he secured the largest number of preferential votes in the Kandy District.

==Prime minister==
Wijetunga was surprisingly appointed Prime Minister in 1989 by President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He also held the Ministries of Finance and Labour and Vocational Training in addition to being the State Minister of Defence in the Premadasa administration.

Lalith Athulathmudali was shot dead in April 1993 while campaigning for the Provincial Council elections. The killing provoked widespread protests against the government and allegations were hurled at the President for complicity in the assassination. A week later President Premadasa was also murdered in Colombo on May Day 1993 in a suicide bombing widely considered to be an act of the Tamil Tigers. Wijetunga became acting president until parliament convened to elect a successor to the slain president under the terms of the Constitution.

Wijetunga was elected unanimously by Parliament to complete the remainder of Premadasa&#x27;s term and was sworn in as the third executive President on 7 May 1993.

==Presidency==
Wijetunga appointed Ranil Wickramasinghe as his prime minister a close relative of former president Jayawardana. 

His rule coincided with the rise of Chandrika Kumaratunga within the ranks of the SLFP.

He did not believe that peace could be achieved by negotiating with the LTTE. The Eastern Province was liberated from the LTTE during his tenure except for Thoppigala.

After a decisive defeat in the Southern Provincial Council Election in 1994, he dissolved parliament prematurely in June of that year.

However his party was defeated in the 1994 general election and Wijetunga appointed Kumaratunga as Prime Minister. Even though under the constitution, Wijetunga was bestowed with wide powers, he chose not to exercise much authority, letting the Prime Minister manage the affairs of the country.

He decided not to contest the presidential election and he appointed Lucky Jayawardena as the organizer for his electorate Udunuwara. He relinquished office in November 1994 after Kumaratunga was elected President by an unprecedented majority. His political career was succeeded by Jayawardena (MP).

==Death==
D.B. Wijetunga died after a prolonged illness around 9.30 am on 21 September 2008 at Kandy General Hospital. He was 92.

&quot;La Boum&quot; was an international box office success, earning 4,378,500 admissions in France, 1,289,289 admissions in Hungary, and 664,981 admissions in West Germany.

===Critical response===
In his review for AllMovie, Hal Erickson called the film &quot;disarmingly diverting&quot; and a &quot;real audience pleaser&quot;.

==Sequel==

A sequel, &quot;La Boum 2&quot;, was released in 1982 in which Marceau reprised her role as Vic. In the sequel, Vic does not have a boyfriend, while her parents are happily back together, and her great-grandmother is considering marriage to her long-term boyfriend. When Vic meets a young boy and becomes attracted to him, she faces the important decision of making love for the first time, as her friends have already done.

<text>A colour is a name for certain kinds of flags.

*&quot;On land&quot;, it usually refers to regimental colours, but the term is also used outside military situations - for example, Boys Brigade as well as the Royal Rangers, Scout and Girl Guide flags are known as colours.
*&quot;At sea&quot;, the term &quot;flying the colours&quot; refers to a warship sailing on the high seas and flying its national ensign, thereby making its presence (and therefore its nation&#x27;s military influence) known to other naval powers.

<text>Culloden ( ; from Scottish Gaelic &#x27;, &quot;back of the small pond&quot;; modern Gaelic&#x27;) is a village east of Inverness, Scotland and the surrounding area. east of the village is Drumossie Moor, site of the Battle of Culloden.

==History==

Culloden village was originally made up of estate houses attached to Culloden House. Historic buildings include Culloden House itself, which is now a hotel, the Culloden stables, now rebuilt as holiday homes, and the historic tithe barn which is now the Barn Church. Additional interesting buildings nearby include the Loch Lann Kennels, the Doocot and the ice house. In the 1960s an area near the historic village was drained for a council housing project, including Culloden Stores, Culloden Academy and Duncan Forbes Primary School, named after the Forbeses of Culloden, who owned Culloden House from 1626 to 1897. More recent private housing developments have since grown up around it. Culloden House is now an hotel.

The parish of Culloden includes three other communities: Balloch , Smithton and Westhill. Like Culloden, Balloch is a village of some antiquity. Smithton and Westhill are post-war housing developments.

==Battlefield of Culloden==
Today, the battlefield of Culloden is under the care of the National Trust for Scotland, and its visitors&#x27; centre is a huge tourist attraction. The National Trust for Scotland has built a visitor centre that includes an interactive battle experience with an immersion film battle room. The visitor centre was officially opened to the public on 16 April 2008 and received 209,011 visitors in 2019.

==Clootie well==
Apart from the battlefield, the most notable site in the surrounding area is the &quot;clootie well&quot;, in Culloden Woods, where brightly coloured rags are hung as offerings from people wishing to be cured of ailments. This well was traditionally visited on the first Sunday in May. Until the early 1970s, this pilgrimage was well attended with &#x27;buses laid on to cater for the crowds. The practice of visiting on a specific day has declined sharply in recent years. A similar, and better known, well is near Munlochy. This tradition may be based on Celtic ceremonies, involving votive offerings to water spirits. The Cairns of Clava, a group of Bronze Age burial mounds, are located at Balnauran of Clava, about south-east of the battlefield.

<text>Esmé Stuart Lennox Robinson (4 October 1886 – 15 October 1958) was an Irish dramatist, poet and theatre producer and director who was involved with the Abbey Theatre.

== Life ==
Robinson was born in Westgrove, Douglas, County Cork and raised in a Protestant and Unionist family in which he was the youngest of seven children. His father, Andrew Robinson, was a middle-class stockbroker who in 1892 decided to become a clergyman in the Church of Ireland in the small Ballymoney parish, near Ballineen in West Cork. A sickly child, Robinson was educated by private tutor and at Bandon Grammar School. In August 1907, his interest in the theatre began after he went to see an Abbey production of plays by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory at the Cork Opera House. He published his first poem that same year. His play, &quot;The Cross Roads&quot;, was performed in the Abbey in 1909 and he became manager of the theatre towards the end of that year. Shortly after joining the Abbey Theatre, he was sent to London for three months to train under George Bernard Shaw as his assistant while he was directing &quot;Misalliance&quot;. He resigned in 1914 as a result of a disastrous tour of the United States but returned in 1919. He was appointed to the board of the theatre in 1923 and continued to serve in that capacity until his death, his Abbey career and production involvement can be found in the Abbey archives As a playwright, Robinson showed himself as a nationalist with plays like &quot;Patriots&quot; (1912) and &quot;Dreamers&quot; (1915). On the other hand, he belonged to a part of Irish society which was not seen as fully Irish. This division between the majority native Irish (Roman Catholics) on one side and the Anglo-Irish (Protestants) on the other can be seen in a play such as &quot;The Big House&quot; (1926), which depicts the burning of a Protestant manor home by the IRA. Robinson&#x27;s most popular plays were &quot;The Whiteheaded Boy&quot; (1916), &quot;The Big House&quot; and &quot;Drama at Inish&quot; (1933).

Other plays included &quot;Crabbed Youth and Age&quot; (1924), &quot;The Far Off Hills&quot; (1928), and &quot;Church Street&quot; (1935). &quot;Drama at Inish&quot;, which was presented in London and on Broadway as &quot;Is Life Worth Living?&quot;, was revived as part of the 2011 season at the Shaw Festival (Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada), with Mary Haney as Lizzie Twohig. Robinson&#x27;s fiction includes &quot;Eight Short Stories&quot; (1919). In 1931 he published a biography of Bryan Cooper, who had recently died. In 1951, he published &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Abbey Theatre&quot;, the first full-length history of the company.

He published an edited edition of Lady Gregory&#x27;s diaries in 1947. In 1958 he co-edited (with Donagh MacDonagh) &quot;The Oxford Book of Irish Verse&#x27;..&quot; He was also a director and producer, in 1930 he produced a play by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy called &quot;The Reapers&quot; and in 1931 he was co-director of &quot;A Disciple&quot; along with W. B. Yeats and Walter Starkie.

==Personal life==
Robinson married artist Dorothy Travers Smith, the Abbey Theatre stage designer. Their correspondence is in the Library of Trinity College Dublin. Dorothy Travers-Smith&#x27;s mother was spiritualist Hester Dowden, the daughter of Irish literary scholar Edward Dowden.

He is buried in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The Abbey Players wished to attend the service but, after having been told by the Archbishop that any Catholic setting foot in the Cathedral or graveyard would be committing a mortal sin, only one attended.
