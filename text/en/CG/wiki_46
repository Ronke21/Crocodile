<text>Proclus is a young lunar impact crater located to the west of the Mare Crisium on the east shore of the Palus Somni. Its diameter is 27 km and it was named after 5th century Greek mathematician, astronomer and philosopher Proclus.

It lies to the south of the prominent, terraced crater Macrobius, and west-northwest of the lava-flooded Yerkes.

==Description==
The rim of Proclus is distinctly polygonal in shape, having the shape of a pentagon, and does not rise very far above the surrounding terrain. It has a high albedo, being second only to Aristarchus in brightness. The interior wall displays some slumping, and the floor is uneven with a few small rises from slump blocks.

The crater has a notable ray system that extends for a distance of over 600 kilometers. The rays display an asymmetry of form, with the most prominent being rays to the northwest, north-northeast, and northeast. There is an arc with no ejecta to the southwest. These features suggest an impact at a low angle. The rays indicate the crater is part of the Copernican System.

A candidate landing site for the Apollo program was located about 100 km north-northeast of Proclus. The site was rejected in favor of the geologically diverse Taurus-Littrow valley for the Apollo 17 mission.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Proclus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Proclus F — &quot;See&quot; Crile (crater).

<doc id="988513" wikidata="Q3987314" url="?curid=988513" title="The Gondoliers">
<text>The Gondoliers; or, The King of Barataria is a Savoy Opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 7 December 1889 and ran for a very successful 554 performances (at that time the fifth longest-running piece of musical theatre in history), closing on 30 June 1891. This was the twelfth comic opera collaboration of fourteen between Gilbert and Sullivan.

The story of the opera concerns brothers Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri, a pair of Venetian gondoliers who are told that one of them is heir to the throne of the fictional kingdom of Barataria; until it can be discovered by the Grand Inquisitor which of them is the heir, they must rule jointly. Unbeknownst to the brothers, who have just married Venetian farm girls, the heir was wed in infancy to the daughter of the Spanish Duke of Plaza-Toro, who is herself in love with her father&#x27;s servant. A subplot concerns the impoverished Duke attempting to improve his finances by forming a limited liability company.

&quot;The Gondoliers&quot; was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s last great success. In this opera, Gilbert returns to the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert&#x27;s fascination with the &quot;Stock Company Act&quot;, highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, &quot;Utopia Limited&quot;. As in several of their earlier operas, by setting the work comfortably far away from England, Gilbert was emboldened to direct sharper criticism at the nobility and the institution of the monarchy itself.

==Background==

===Genesis of the opera===

&quot;The Gondoliers&quot; was preceded by the most serious of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;. On 9 January 1889, three months into that opera&#x27;s fourteen-month run, Sullivan informed the librettist that he &quot;wanted to do some dramatic work on a larger musical scale&quot;, that he &quot;wished to get rid of the &#x27;strongly marked rhythm&#x27;, and &#x27;rhymed&#x27; couplets, and have words that would have a chance of developing &#x27;musical effects&#x27;.&quot; Gilbert counselled strongly that the partnership should continue on its former course:

On 12 March, Sullivan responded, &quot;I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it... You say that in a serious opera, &quot;you&quot; must more or less sacrifice yourself. I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful.&quot;

A series of increasingly acrimonious letters followed over the ensuing weeks, with Sullivan laying down new terms for the collaboration, and Gilbert insisting that he had always bent over backwards to comply with the composer&#x27;s musical requirements. Gilbert tried to encourage his collaborator:


Gilbert offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted – that the composer would write a light opera for the Savoy, and a grand opera (&quot;Ivanhoe&quot;) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing for that purpose. Sullivan&#x27;s acceptance came with the proviso that &quot;we are thoroughly agreed upon the subject.&quot; Gilbert suggested an opera based on a theatrical company, which Sullivan rejected (though a version of it would be resurrected in 1896 as &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;), but he accepted an idea &quot;connected with Venice and Venetian life, and this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music. Can you not develop this with something we can both go into with warmth and enthusiasm and thus give me a subject in which (like &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;) we can both be interested...?&quot;

Gilbert set to work on the new libretto by the early summer of 1889, and by the mid-summer Sullivan had started composing Act I. Gilbert provided Sullivan with alternative lyrics for many passages, allowing the composer to choose which ones he preferred. The long opening number (more than fifteen minutes of continuous music) was the librettist&#x27;s idea, and it gave Sullivan the opportunity to establish the mood of the work through music. The costumes were designed by Percy Anderson and sets were by Hawes Craven, with choreography by Willie Warde.

They worked all summer and autumn, with a successful opening on 7 December 1889. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable, and the opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s old collaborator on &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (and the editor of &quot;Punch&quot;), F. C. Burnand, wrote, &quot;Magnificento! ... I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.&quot;

===Reaction of the press and public===
Leslie Baily notes, &quot;The bubbling, champagne-quality of the libretto brought out the gayest Sullivan, and the Italian setting called up a warm, southern response from his own ancestry. The &quot;Graphic&quot; (14 December 1889) pointed out that the music contains not only an English idiom but &#x27;the composer has borrowed from France the stately gavotte, from Spain the Andalusian cachucha, from Italy the saltarello and the tarantella, and from Venice itself the Venetian barcarolle&#x27;.&quot;

Of Gilbert&#x27;s contribution, the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; reported, &quot;Mr. W. S. Gilbert has returned to the Gilbert of the past, and everyone is delighted. He is himself again. The Gilbert of &quot;The Bab Ballads&quot;, the Gilbert of whimsical conceit, inoffensive cynicism, subtle satire, and playful paradox; the Gilbert who invented a school of his own, who in it was schoolmaster and pupil, who has never taught anybody but himself, and is never likely to have any imitator – this is the Gilbert the public want to see, and this is the Gilbert who on Saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more.&quot;

There was a command performance of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 6 March 1891, the first performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured and the first theatrical entertainment to take place at Windsor since the death of Prince Albert thirty years earlier.

===The Carpet Quarrel===

With the exception of their first opera, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte produced every Gilbert and Sullivan opera and had built the Savoy Theatre specifically for productions of their shows. However, on several occasions during the 1880s the relationship among Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had been strained.

In April 1890, during the run of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 () carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert confronted Carte, but the producer refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that &quot;I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen&quot;. Helen D&#x27;Oyly Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte &quot;in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.&quot; As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:

Things soon degraded, Gilbert lost his temper with his partners and brought a lawsuit against Carte. Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell when, in fact, those expenses had already been paid. When Gilbert discovered this, he asked for a retraction of the affidavit; Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt betrayed. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte&#x27;s good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House (now the Palace Theatre), to produce Sullivan&#x27;s only grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. After &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.

Gilbert&#x27;s aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Sullivan and Carte. But the partnership had been so profitable that Carte eventually sought to reunite the dramatist and composer. After many failed attempts by Carte and his wife, Gilbert and Sullivan reunited through the efforts of their music publisher, Tom Chappell. In 1893, they produced their penultimate collaboration, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;, but &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; would prove to be Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s last big hit. &quot;Utopia&quot; was only a modest success, and their final collaboration, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, in 1896, was a failure. After that, the two never collaborated again.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
The scene opens in Venice with 24 farm girls declaring their passionate love for a pair of gondoliers, Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri. These two gondoliers are so gallant and peerless in their manly beauty that the maidens are waiting for them to select brides before they can consider other suitors. A large group of merry gondoliers enter, saying that they adore the young women, who explain that the two brothers must choose first. When the Palmieri brothers enter, the women present them with flowers. The two gondoliers amiably offer to pick their brides in a game of blind man&#x27;s buff. They appear to be cheating by peeking out from under their blindfolds, however. Eventually, from the crowd of maidens, Giuseppe picks Tessa, and Marco picks Gianetta – &quot;Just the very girl I wanted!&quot; (although the two then politely offer to switch). All leave to go to church for the double wedding.
His Grace the Duke of Plaza Toro (Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro), Her Grace the Duchess, their beautiful daughter Casilda, and their drummer, Luiz, now arrive in Venice from Spain. They have come to meet Don Alhambra del Bolero, the Grand Inquisitor of Spain. As Luiz goes to announce the Duke&#x27;s presence, the Duke and Duchess tell their daughter a secret that they have kept for twenty years – when she was only six months old, she was married to the infant son and heir of the King of Barataria. She is indignant, since the union was conducted without her consent. The infant prince was taken from his home by the Grand Inquisitor, after the king of Barataria became a Wesleyan Methodist &quot;of the most bigoted and persecuting type&quot;, and taken to Venice. The King of Barataria was recently killed in an insurrection, and the hidden prince is now king. As the wife of the new king, Casilda is now the reigning queen of Barataria, and her parents have brought her to meet with the Grand Inquisitor to be introduced to her husband. We soon discover, however that Casilda is secretly in love with Luiz. Left alone together, she tells him of her infant marriage, and they resign themselves to a life forever apart, with only their happy memories to comfort them.

When the Grand Inquisitor arrives, he explains that the prince was raised by Baptisto Palmieri, a humble gondolier, who had a young son of his own about the same age. The gondolier was a drunkard and eventually forgot which boy was his own son and which boy was the prince of Barataria. The two boys (Marco and Giuseppe) grew up and now are both gondoliers themselves. Fortunately, the nurse who took care of the infant prince (and who happens to be Luiz&#x27;s mother), is now living in the mountains, married to &quot;a highly respectable brigand&quot;. Don Alhambra says that he has located her and that she will be able to reveal which of the two gondoliers is the lost prince. If not, he says, &quot;then the persuasive influence of the torture chamber will jog her memory.&quot;

In the next scene, the two gondoliers have married Tessa and Gianetta, and as they are extolling the virtues of marriage, Don Alhambra arrives and informs them that one of them is the King of Barataria, but no one knows which. Despite being Republicans, the gondoliers and their new wives are delighted, and agree to go to Barataria at once, acting as one individual until the actual king is identified. The Grand Inquisitor tells them, however, that women are not admitted until the actual king is identified, and then each couple can be reunited. The Grand Inquisitor neglects to mention that the King is married to Casilda, fearing that it would cause the men to refuse to leave their new wives. As the two wives are imagining what it will be like to be a queen, their friends enter, and Marco and Giuseppe announce their discovery and promise to reign in a Republican fashion. They announce that in their kingdom, &quot;All shall equal be&quot; and will create new posts such as &quot;the Lord High Coachman on the Box, the Lord High Vagabond in the Stocks&quot;. All the men then set sail for Barataria, leaving their wives behind in Venice.

===Act II===
In Barataria, the gondolier-courtiers are all enjoying living under &quot;a monarchy that&#x27;s tempered with Republican equality&quot;. Marco and Giuseppe have been doing all the work around the palace for the past three months – it is the privilege of royalty! They are happy enough with this arrangement, except that they are worried about having to share a single portion of rations between the two of them, and they miss their wives. Soon, however, all the women arrive, having risked the long sea voyage from Venice – they could no longer stand the separation. In delight, the reunited couples have a magnificent banquet and a dance (a cachucha).
The Grand Inquisitor arrives at the ball to find that the Republican gondoliers have promoted everyone to the nobility. He explains that there must be a distinction between commoners and those of rank, warning that &quot;when &quot;everyone&quot; is somebody, then no-one&#x27;s &quot;anybody&quot;&quot;. He then breaks the news that one of the gondoliers had married Casilda when a baby and therefore is an unintentional bigamist. The gondoliers attempt to console their wives, who are distraught to discover that neither one will be queen, and that one married someone who is already married.

The Duke and Duchess of Plaza Toro soon arrive with the beautiful Casilda. They are now dressed in style, and the Duke explains how he was applied for by the public under the Limited Liability Company Act, and how they now earn a very good living. Appalled, however, at the lack of pomp and ceremony with which they were received, he attempts to educate the two monarchs in proper royal behaviour. After a lesson in etiquette, the two Palmieri brothers are left alone with Casilda. She agrees to be an obedient wife, but warns them that she is &quot;over head and ears in love with someone else.&quot; Seizing this opportunity, the two men introduce their wives. The three women and two men sing a quintet about their unprecedented predicament.

Don Alhambra brings in the nurse who had tended the infant prince of Barataria twenty years ago. She reveals that when the Grand Inquisitor came to steal the prince, she had loyally hidden him away, and given Don Alhambra her own young son instead. Thus, the king is neither Marco nor Giuseppe, but her own son, Luiz. This resolves the romantic entanglements to everyone&#x27;s satisfaction. Casilda finds that she is already married to the man she loves, Luiz. The two gondoliers surrender their crown to Luiz and, though a bit disappointed that neither will be a king, they can return happily to Venice with their wives. There is a final dance for the full company, reprising the gondoliers&#x27; Act I duet and the cachucha.

==Productions==
&quot;The Gondoliers&quot; was immediately a hit in London, playing for 554 performances, the fourth longest of the series (after &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;). It earned more money than any other Savoy opera in its original run. 20,000 copies of the published score were sold on publication, and over 70,000 copies of various arrangements were sold within a few days. D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s &quot;E&quot; Company mounted the first provincial production on 19 February 1890 in Preston. From then on, it was never absent from the touring repertory until it was omitted from the final two seasons (September 1980–February 1982) before the closing of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. Percy Anderson refreshed his original costume designs in 1917, 1919 and 1928.
The opera fared less well in New York. It opened at the New Park Theatre on 7 January 1890 and was immediately panned. Gilbert &quot;refused to indorse the company sent to New York ... because he considered the company a &#x27;scratch&#x27; one.&quot; Carte came to New York to investigate and closed the production on 13 February. He brought in replacements for most of the cast, and remounted the production at Palmer&#x27;s Theatre on 18 February. However, the damage was done, and the production ran for just 103 performances in total. The New York press dubbed the opera &quot;the gone-dollars.&quot; The first production on the European continent was given at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna (as &quot;Die Gondoliere&quot;) on 20 September 1890. In Australia, its first authorised performance was on 25 October 1890 at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, produced by J. C. Williamson.

A new production, with new sets and costumes designed by Charles Ricketts, was prepared for the opening of the renovated Savoy Theatre on 21 October 1929. The critic Ernest Newman wrote: &quot;It was a subtle stroke to open with &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;; there is a peculiar richness of blood in the music of this work that makes the new theatre and the new designs and dresses by Mr. Charles Ricketts particularly appropriate.&quot; The performance was conducted by Malcolm Sargent, and the theatre&#x27;s only box was occupied by Lady Gilbert. Peter Goffin designed new touring sets in 1957, and another notable new production was staged by the company in 1958 at the Princes Theatre with sets and costumes by Goffin. In 1967, new costumes were designed by Luciana Arrighi, with new sets by John Stoddart.

The first non-D&#x27;Oyly Carte professional production in the United Kingdom was given by Scottish Opera on 12 December 1968, with Ian Wallace as the Duke. There was also a production by the New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera in February 1984, with John Fryatt as the Duke and Donald Adams as Don Alhambra. A Mafia-themed adaptation of the opera, by John Doyle and Sarah Travis, was given at the Watermill Theatre and transferred to the Apollo Theatre in the West End in 2001. The production utilised Doyle&#x27;s signature conceit of the actors playing their own orchestra instruments.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions in London and New York during Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:

==Historical casting==
The following tables show the casts of the principal early productions and D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at various times through to the company&#x27;s 1982 closure. The roles of Ottavio and the Drummer Boy were credited only in the original production. Notable casting substitutions are shown for the first New York production; otherwise, only first-night casts are shown.

==Recordings==
The 1927 &quot;Gondoliers&quot; is admired for its excellent cast. The 1961 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording is a good stereo recording and includes complete dialogue. The 1957 Sargent/Glyndebourne and 1991 New D&#x27;Oyly Carte recordings are both musically well regarded.

More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

<text>Vasily Danilovich Sokolovsky (; July 21, 1897 – May 10, 1968) was a Soviet general, military theorist, Marshal of the Soviet Union, and a commander of Red Army forces during World War II. As Georgy Zhukov&#x27;s chief of staff, Sokolovsky helped plan and execute the Battle of Berlin. He also served as head of the Soviet Forces in East Germany and the Soviet Chief of the General Staff.

Born to a Belarusian peasant family in Grodno in the Russian Empire, Sokolovsky joined the Red Army in 1918 and served with distinction in Central Asia during the Russian Civil War. He held a number of staff positions, eventually becoming Deputy Chief of the General Staff at the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In late 1941, he helped coordinate the Soviet counter-offensive at the Battle of Moscow and drove German forces from the capital. As commander of the Soviet Western Front, he then took part in the Battle of Kursk and Operation Kutuzov. In April 1944, Sokolovsky was named chief of staff of the 1st Ukrainian Front under Georgy Zhukov, a position he served until the end of the war. In that capacity, he helped execute Zhukov&#x27;s capture of Berlin.

After the war, Sokolovsky was named deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany until July 1946, when he was promoted to commander-in-chief and head of the Soviet Military Administration; he was also named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. In 1949, Sokolovsky became the Soviet Deputy Minister of Defense, and in 1952 he was made Chief of the General Staff. He had effectively retired by 1960 but achieved renewed international fame with his volumes on military strategy. Sokolovsky died in 1968 at the age of 70.

== Early life ==
Sokolovsky was born into a Belarusian peasant family in Kozliki, a small town in the province of Grodno (now in Białystok County in eastern Poland, then part of the Russian Empire). He worked as a teacher in a rural school, where he took part in a number of protests and demonstrations against the Tsar.

==Military career==

Sokolovsky joined the Red Army in February 1918.

He began his formal military schooling in 1919, but was frequently called up by the Red Army and forced to leave his schoolwork. He graduated in 1921 and became the chief of staff of a division stationed in Turkmenistan. He was wounded during a battle near Samarkand and subsequently decorated for bravery. After the Russian Civil War ended in 1922/1923 he held a number of staff positions, eventually becoming the chief of staff for the Moscow Military District and then the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, the position he held at the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941).

In December 1941, with German forces a mere 20 kilometers from Moscow, Sokolovsky was made the chief of staff of the Soviet Western Front, where he was able to help co-ordinate the Soviet winter counter-attacks that forced the Germans away from Moscow. He remained in this position until February 1943, when he became the commander of the Western Front.

He led this front through the Battle of Kursk. In the summer of 1943, the Soviets launched Operation Kutuzov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The Bryansk Front, under the command of Markian Popov, attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front, commanded by Sokolovsky, attacked from the north. The operation ended on 18 August 1943 with the Soviet capture of Orel and collapse of the Orel bulge. In October–November 1943, Sokolovsky commanded the Western Front in failed Soviet Orsha offensives against Gotthard Heinrici&#x27;s 4th Army in the Orsha region of Belarus. In April 1944 the Western Front was broken into two parts and Sokolovsky was made chief of staff of 1st Ukrainian Front under Georgy Zhukov. He remained in this position until the end of the war in 1945. As the chief of staff of 1st Ukrainian Front, Sokolovsky helped plan and execute the capture of Berlin. Sokolovsky sat next to Zhukov as he accepted the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin.

After World War II, Sokolovsky became the deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet Forces in East Germany until July 3, 1946. On that day Sokolovsky was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, and also made commander-in-chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and head of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. His walking out of a meeting of the Allied Control Council on 20 March 1948 as the Soviet representative on that body effectively immobilized it from that date. In 1949 he became the Soviet Union&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Defense, a position he held until 1952, when he was made the Chief of the General Staff. In 1960 Sokolovsky became the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defense. He retained this position until his death in 1968.

Sokolovsky became widely known in the West with the publication in 1962 of &quot;Military Strategy&quot;, a book that contained rare detail on Soviet thinking about war, particularly nuclear war.

Sokolovsky was a key member of the Soviet war command during World War II and known as an excellent planner and exceptional military leader. He was particularly well-trusted by Marshal Georgy Zhukov. 

Sokolovsky died on May 10, 1968, at aged 70. The urn containing his ashes was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

Sokolovsky appears as a prominent figure in William T. Vollmann&#x27;s 2005 National Book Award-winning novel, &quot;Europe Central&quot;.

<doc id="988519" wikidata="Q946060" url="?curid=988519" title="Granard">
<text>Granard () is a town in the north of County Longford, Ireland, and has a traceable history going back to 236 CE. It is situated just south of the boundary between the watersheds of the Shannon and the Erne, at the point where the N55 national secondary road and the R194 regional road meet. It is 20 km north-east of Longford town. The barony of Granard is named for the town. The town is also in the civil parish of Granard.

==History==
The town has been a centre of population since Celtic times, probably because of its elevated position offering a view over the surrounding countryside. It is mentioned in the ancient Irish epic, the &quot;Táin Bó Cuailgne&quot;, as being one of the places where Queen Medb and her army stopped on their journey to take the &quot;Donn Cuailnge&quot; (the &quot;Brown Bull of Cooley&quot;). The name of the village is itself so ancient as to be unclear even in Irish; the 11th-century writers of the &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; (containing the oldest written version of the &quot;Táin&quot;) refer to it by means of a gloss as &quot;Gránairud Tethba tuaiscirt .i. Gránard indiu&quot; (&quot;Gránairud of northern Teathbha, i.e. Gránard of today&quot;). According to the &quot;Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick&quot;, Patrick appointed &quot;Guasacht&quot;, a son of his former master Milchú, as first bishop of Granard, but the diocese did not survive as a separate entity. The surname Sheridan was first recorded in Granard in the 8th century.

Granard is known for the motte built by Risteárd de Tiúit. It stands 166 m (543 ft) above sea level, located at the head of the village. A statue of St Patrick was erected on the motte in 1932 to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the coming of the saint to Ireland for the second time. Due to the location between the three rivers and near Lough Sheelin, it is also a centre for trout and coarse fishing. The Gaynors (Mag Fhionbharra, from Fionnbharr Ó Géaradháin) were once the Gaelic lords of Granard.

Between 1780-87, a large new market house was constructed in the town enhancing Granard&#x27;s position as a market town for the local area. It was built under the patronage of the local McCartney family.

Granard was the location of an annual &quot;Harp festival&quot; from 1781 to 1785. This had been due to the financial support of James Dungan, an Irish merchant then residing in Copenhagen, and a native of Granard, who had heard of similar events being organised in Scotland. Many of the harpists who won prizes at these festivals, including Charles Fanning, Arthur O&#x27;Neill, and Rose Mooney went on to perform at the Belfast Harp Festival in July 1792. There has been a revival of the festival since 1981.

During the Irish War of Independence, on 31 October 1920 a police officer, District-Inspector Philip Kelleher was shot dead by two masked men in the bar of the Greville Arms Hotel, Granard. As a reprisal, a motor convoy of Crown forces entered the village four days later and systematically destroyed some of the main business premises of the town.

==Administration==
In 1899, Granard became an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. The urban district council was downgraded to a town commissioners in the early years of the Irish Free State. In 2002, it became Granard Town Council.

In 2014, this local government body was abolished. Since then, the town has fallen within the responsibility of Longford County Council. Granard Municipal District is represented by five elected councillors.

==Transport==
Granard is within the catchment area for Edgeworthstown railway station. The station is about a fifteen-minute drive; there is no bus link.

Bus Éireann Expressway route 65 provides one service a day to Monaghan (with onward connections to Belfast) and one service a day to Athlone (with onward connections to Galway). On Fridays there is a second service each way. Bus Éireann local route 111A between Cavan and Athboy (with onward connections to Trim and Dublin) serves Granard and operates four times a day each way, thrice each way on Saturdays and once each way on Sundays.

Donnelly&#x27;s Pioneer Bus Service, a local bus company based in Granard, operate a Local Link route from Granard to Longford via Ballinalee. There are several journeys each way, with no Sunday service.

<text>The Grand Duke; or, The Statutory Duel, is the final Savoy Opera written by librettist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan, their fourteenth and last opera together. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 7 March 1896, and ran for 123 performances. Despite a successful opening night, the production had a relatively short run and was the partnership&#x27;s only financial failure, and the two men never worked together again. In recent decades, the opera has been revived professionally, first in the US and then in the UK.

In &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan come full circle, back to the theme of their first collaboration, &quot;Thespis&quot;: a troupe of actors taking political power. The plot hinges on the mis-interpretation of a 100-year-old law regarding statutory duels (decided by drawing cards). The baffled leading comedian of the troupe, Ludwig, spearheads the rebellion against the hypochondriac, miserly Grand Duke and becomes engaged to four different women before the plot is resolved. The frugality and phoniness of the wealthy classes and the nobility are lampooned and, as in &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, and &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;, the foreign setting emboldens Gilbert to use some particularly pointed satire. Sullivan&#x27;s varied score includes lilting Viennese waltz music.

==Background==
During the production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1889 comic opera, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Gilbert became embroiled in a legal dispute with producer Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte over the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre and, more generally, over the accounting for expenses of the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership. Sullivan sided with Carte (who was about to produce Sullivan&#x27;s grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;), and the partnership disbanded. After &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti and vowed to write no more operas for the Savoy. The lawsuit left Gilbert and Sullivan somewhat embittered, and though they finally collaborated on two more works, these suffered from a less collegial working relationship than the two men had typically enjoyed while writing earlier operas.

Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s penultimate opera, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893), was a very modest success compared with their earlier collaborations. It introduced Gilbert&#x27;s last protégée, Nancy McIntosh, as the heroine, who received generally unfavourable press. Sullivan refused to write another piece if she was to take part in it. Discussions over her playing the role of Yum-Yum in a proposed revival of &quot;The Mikado&quot; led to another row between Gilbert and Sullivan that prevented the revival, and Gilbert&#x27;s insistence upon her appearing in his 1894 opera, &quot;His Excellency&quot;, caused Sullivan to refuse to set the piece. After &quot;His Excellency&quot; closed in April 1895, McIntosh wrote to Sullivan informing him that she planned to return to concert singing, and so the obstacle to his further collaboration with Gilbert was removed. Meanwhile, Sullivan had written a comic opera for the Savoy Theatre with F. C. Burnand, &quot;The Chieftain&quot;, but that had closed in March 1895.

===Genesis===
Gilbert had begun working on the story of &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; in late 1894. Elements of the plot were based on several antecedents including &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1853), a short story by Tom Taylor, published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, about a poor duke who hires French actors to play courtiers to impress his rich fiancée. The story also contains the germ of the character of Ernest. In 1888, &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; was adapted as &quot;The Prima Donna&quot;, a comic opera by H. B. Farnie that contains other details seen in &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, including the Shakespearean costumes, a prince and princess who make a theatrical entrance. In addition, the plot shows similarities with the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;Thespis&quot;, in which a company of actors gain political power. Gilbert read a sketch of the plot to Sullivan on 8 August 1895, and Sullivan wrote on 11 August to say that he would be pleased to write the music, calling Gilbert&#x27;s plot sketch &quot;as clear and bright as possible&quot;. The theme of Ernest (and then Rudolph) being legally dead while still physically alive was used in earlier works by Gilbert and, separately by Sullivan, for example &quot;Tom Cobb&quot; (1875) and &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (1867). Gilbert sold the libretto of the new piece to Carte and Sullivan for £5,000, and so he took no risk as to whether or not it would succeed.

Mr. and Mrs. Carte hired a new soprano, the Hungarian Ilka Pálmay, who had recently arrived in England and quickly made a favourable impression on London audiences and critics with her charming personality. Gilbert devised a new plot line revolving around Pálmay, making her character, Julia, an English actress among a company of German actors, with the topsy-turvy conceit that her &quot;strong English accent&quot; was forgiven by her audiences because of her great dramatic artistry. Rutland Barrington&#x27;s role, Ludwig, became the leading comedian of the theatrical company and the central role in the opera. Gilbert had paired the title character with contralto Rosina Brandram, causing Sullivan to suggest some different pairings of the characters, but Gilbert and the Cartes disagreed; Mrs. Carte went so far as to caution Sullivan that his ideas would upset the casting. Unhappily for Gilbert, three of his usual principal players, George Grossmith, Richard Temple and Jessie Bond, who he had originally thought would play the title character, the prince and the princess, all left the company before rehearsals began for &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, and so he reduced the size of these roles, further changing his original conception.

While Gilbert and Sullivan finished writing the show, the Cartes produced a revival of &quot;The Mikado&quot; at the Savoy Theatre, opening on 6 November 1895. Rehearsals for &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; began in January. Sullivan wrote the overture himself, effectively weaving together some of the best melodies in the opera. Gilbert made a few additional changes to the libretto shortly before opening night to avoid giving offense to Kaiser Wilhelm, possibly at the request of Sullivan, who valued the Kaiser&#x27;s friendship. These included changing the name of the title character from Wilhelm to Rudolph.

===Original production and reception===
The opera premiered on 7 March 1896, and Sullivan conducted the orchestra, as he always did on opening nights. Costumes were by Percy Anderson. The opening night was a decided success, and the critics praised Gilbert&#x27;s direction, Pálmay&#x27;s singing and acting, Walter Passmore as Rudolph, and the cast in general. There were some reservations, however. &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s review of the opening night&#x27;s performance said:

The reviewer stated that the jokes might be funnier if the dialogue between them were &quot;compressed&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; concurred: &quot;Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s tendency to over-elaboration has nowhere shown itself so obtrusively... Mr. Gilbert has introduced too many whimsical ideas which practically bear no relation to the story proper&quot;. Although the audience greeted the new piece enthusiastically, neither partner was satisfied. Sullivan wrote in his diary, &quot;Parts of it dragged a little – dialogue too redundant but success great and genuine I think... Thank God opera is finished &amp; out.&quot; Gilbert wrote to his friend, Mrs. Bram Stoker: &quot;I&#x27;m not at all a proud Mother, and I never want to see this ugly misshapen little brat again.&quot;

After the opening night, Sullivan left to recuperate in Monte Carlo. Gilbert reacted to the reviews by making cuts in the opera. These included three songs in Act II, and commentators have questioned the wisdom of these particular cuts, especially the Baroness&#x27;s drinking song and the Prince&#x27;s roulette song. &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; closed after 123 performances on 11 July 1896, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s only financial failure. It toured the British provinces for a year and was produced in Germany on 20 May 1896 at the Unter den Linden Theatre in Berlin and on a D&#x27;Oyly Carte tour of South Africa the same year. After this, it disappeared from the professional repertory, although Gilbert considered reviving it in 1909.

==Analysis and subsequent history==
&quot;The Grand Duke&quot; is longer than most of the earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and more of the libretto is devoted to dialogue. Gilbert&#x27;s cutting of parts of the opera after the opening night did not prevent it from having a shorter run than any of the earlier collaborations since &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. In addition to whatever weaknesses the show had, as compared with earlier Gilbert and Sullivan pieces, the taste of the London theatregoing public had shifted away from comic opera to musical comedies, such as &quot;A Gaiety Girl&quot; (1893), &quot;The Shop Girl&quot; (1894) and &quot;An Artist&#x27;s Model&quot; (1895), which were to dominate the London stage through World War I. One of the most successful musical comedies of the 1890s, &quot;The Geisha&quot; (1896), competed directly against &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; and was by far the greater success.
After its original production, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; was not revived by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1975 (and then only in concert), and performances by other companies have been less frequent than most of the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas. 20th century critics dismissed the work. For example, H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921, &quot;It reads like the work of a tired man. ... There is his manner but not his wit, his lyrical fluency but not his charm. ... [For] the most part, the lyrics were uninspiring and the melodies uninspired.&quot; Of Gilbert&#x27;s work in the opera, Isaac Goldberg opined, &quot;the old self-censorship has relaxed&quot;, and of Sullivan&#x27;s he concludes, &quot;his grip upon the text was relaxing; he pays less attention to the words, setting them with less regard than formerly to their natural rhythms&quot;.

In the first half of the 20th century, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; was produced occasionally by amateur companies, including the Savoy Company in Philadelphia and the Blue Hill Troupe in New York City, who pride themselves on producing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In America, it was mounted by professional companies, including the American Savoyards, beginning in 1959, and the Light Opera of Manhattan in the 1970s and 1980s. The BBC assembled a cast to broadcast the opera (together with the rest of the Gilbert and Sullivan series) in 1966 (led by former D&#x27;Oyly Carte comic Peter Pratt) and again in 1989. Of a 1962 production by The Lyric Theater Company of Washington, D.C., &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;the difficulties were worth surmounting, for the work is a delight. ... Throughout the work are echoes of their earlier and more successful collaborations, but Pfennig Halbpfennig retains a flavor all its own.&quot;

Since the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company released its recording of the piece in 1976, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; has been produced more frequently. The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players produced a concert version in 1995 and a full production in 2011. Writer Marc Shepherd concluded that the work &quot;is full of bright comic situations and Gilbert&#x27;s characteristic topsy-turvy wit. Sullivan&#x27;s contribution has been considered first-rate from the beginning. The opera shows him branching out into a more harmonically adventurous Continental operetta style.&quot; The first fully staged professional revival in the UK took place in 2012 at the Finborough Theatre in London, starring Richard Suart in the title role, with a reduced cast and two-piano accompaniment. The Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company presented a full-scale professional production with orchestra at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton later in 2012. Other productions accelerated in the UK, US and elsewhere, and the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society reported in 2024 that &quot;In the present century, there are something like half a dozen amateur [UK] &quot;Grand Dukes&quot; each year.&quot; Forbear! Theatre&#x27;s production at the Drayton Arms Theatre, London, in 2024 makes it the first professional company in the UK to have presented two staged productions of the opera since the D&#x27;Oyly Carte.

==Roles and casting==

The original and 1975 principal cast were as follows:

==Synopsis==

&quot;The Grand Duke&quot; is set in the Grand Duchy of Pfennig-Halbpfennig in 1750.

===Act I===
In the market square in the capital city, Speisesaal, Ernest Dummkopf&#x27;s theatrical company is ready to open their production of &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; that night. They also prepare to celebrate the wedding of the troupe&#x27;s leading comedian, Ludwig, to Lisa, a soubrette of the company. The marriage cannot take place, however, as there are no parsons available in the city: all clerics have been summoned to the palace by the Grand Duke of Pfennig-Halbpfennig to discuss his own forthcoming marriage. Everyone has grown to resent the Grand Duke, and all of the company had already become members of a plot to blow him up with dynamite and place a new man on the throne. The secret sign by which members of the conspiracy recognise each other is to eat a sausage roll – a food of which they are by now all heartily sick.

It is clear that Ernest will win the election which is to follow the coup and become Grand Duke, which troubles Julia Jellicoe, a famous English comedian. As leading lady of the company, she is bound by contract to play the leading female role in any production. If Ernest, the manager, becomes the Grand Duke, she reasons that she will have to be the Grand Duchess. She says that this is a repugnant prospect to her (though it is a delightful one to Ernest), but that she will play the part in a professional manner.

:&quot;Note:&quot; Gilbert supplied a topsy-turvy twist by writing Julia&#x27;s dialogue in a &quot;German&quot; accent, since she is the only &quot;English&quot; character in Ernest&#x27;s company; all of the Germans speak with an English accent. The first Julia, Ilka Pálmay, was Hungarian but performed mostly in German. Modern productions do not always carry out this idea. For instance, in the 1976 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording (which did not include the dialogue), the singer playing Julia did not affect a German accent.
Meanwhile, Ludwig has met a man who returned his secret salute by eating &quot;three&quot; sausage rolls. Ludwig believed him to be a member of the conspiracy and told him all the details; only then did he realise that he had revealed the entire plot to the Grand Duke&#x27;s private detective. The company are aghast, believing they are doomed once the Grand Duke learns of the plot. The company&#x27;s notary, Dr. Tannhäuser, appears and offers a solution. He explains that a century ago the Grand Duke of the time, concerned about the loss of life in duelling, had created the &quot;statutory duel&quot;: the duellers draw cards, and the one who draws the lower card loses. He becomes legally dead, and the winner takes over his position: his property, responsibilities and debts. The law regulating statutory duels, like all laws of Pfennig-Halbpfennig, lasts for one hundred years unless revived, and it is to lapse tomorrow.

Tannhäuser counsels Ernest and Ludwig to fight a statutory duel immediately: the loser will be legally dead, and the survivor can go to the Duke and confess the whole plot. As informer he will be spared, while the other party will be dead and so beyond retribution. The next day, the loser will come to life when the law lapses, but since death expunges crime, his character will be unstained. Ernest and Ludwig promptly &quot;fight&quot; a statutory duel: Ernest draws a king, but Ludwig draws an ace and is declared the winner.

They leave, and the miserly yet pompous and moralistic Grand Duke Rudolph appears, heralded by his corps of chamberlains. He instructs them in the arrangements for his wedding the next day to the rich, but also miserly, Baroness Caroline von Krakenfeldt. She arrives, handing him a letter from his detective, and they sing about how exactly in agreement are their ideas on economy. Caroline is disconcerted that Rudolph insists on courting her in the market square, but he explains that he has made a law compelling couples to do all courting in the square so as to increase the value of his properties around the square. She approves of this example of economy.
Caroline is also upset by a newspaper article which says that Rudolph was betrothed in infancy to the Princess of Monte Carlo, but he explains that the engagement is &quot;practically off.&quot; The betrothal lapses when the Princess reaches the age of twenty-one, which will happen tomorrow, and her father, the Prince, dares not venture out of his house for fear of being arrested by his creditors.

Once he is alone, Rudolph reads the letter and learns about the plot to blow him up. Ludwig arrives, intent on denouncing the plot to him. Before he can do so, Rudolph declares that he would give anything to avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will bear the brunt of it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph can come back to life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig&#x27;s proposal.

Rudolph and Ludwig summon the city&#x27;s inhabitants. They stage a mock quarrel and conduct the rigged statutory duel as planned: Rudolph&#x27;s king is beaten by Ludwig&#x27;s ace, making Ludwig the Grand Duke. Rudolph&#x27;s subjects berate him with scorn, and he retreats, threatening revenge. Ludwig uses his new powers to extend the Act for another hundred years, thus ensuring that neither Rudolph nor Ernest can come back to life.

Julia Jellicoe appears and once again asserts that, as leading lady, she must take the leading role of the Grand Duchess. Lisa leaves in tears. Julia points out that if she and Ludwig are to rule over a Grand Ducal court, they need to be dressed more impressively than their everyday clothes will allow. Ludwig recalls that they have a complete set of brand-new costumes for &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, which they can use to &quot;upraise the dead old days of Athens in her glory.&quot;

===Act II===

In a room in the Ducal palace, the new Grand Duke, Grand Duchess and court parade in classical costumes and sing a Grecian chorus. Left alone, Ludwig and Julia fail to agree on how her role is to be played. Caroline von Krakenfeldt arrives for her wedding and is startled to find that Rudolph has been replaced by Ludwig. But once she discovers that Ludwig has beaten Rudolph in a statutory duel, she points out that he must take on Rudolph&#x27;s responsibilities – including his betrothal to her. So despite being already married to Julia, Ludwig goes off with Caroline to get married, and Julia makes a dramatic exit.

Ernest, though legally dead, is desperate for news and arrives to try to find out what is going on. He sees the wedding procession in the distance and assumes that Ludwig is marrying Lisa; but it cannot be so, for Lisa appears. She sees him and runs away in fright, since he is a &quot;ghost&quot;. He then supposes that Ludwig must be marrying his Julia, but she too appears. Though affecting to be also frightened, she stays and tells him what Ludwig has done.
They leave, and the wedding party returns. Caroline is enjoying the rare pleasure of drinking &quot;when somebody else pays the bill.&quot; Yet another unexpected visitor arrives: it is a herald, who announces that the Prince and Princess of Monte Carlo are on their way. Ludwig decides to give the Prince a theatrical welcome, and tells the company to hide.

The Prince of Monte Carlo arrives with his daughter the Princess and a retinue of supernumeraries – out-of-work actors hired from the Theatre Monaco to play the part of nobles. He has reversed his fortunes by inventing a game called roulette, which has allowed him to pay his debts, hire the supernumeraries, and take his daughter to Pfennig-Halbpfennig just in time to marry the Grand Duke before the engagement expires.

Ludwig and the court spring out at them, dancing a lively can-can. The Princess is shocked and upset when she discovers that Ludwig already has three Grand Duchesses. She points out, however, that her claim predates the others&#x27;, and Ludwig is therefore obliged to marry her.

Ludwig and the Princess are about to go off to yet another wedding party, when Ernest, Rudolph and Dr Tannhäuser burst in. The Notary reveals that the Act regulating statutory duels specifically states that the ace shall count as lowest, so Ludwig did not win, was never Grand Duke, and cannot have revived the act. Within seconds, the Act expires, returning Ludwig and Ernest to the living. Three couples marry: Rudolph and the Princess; Ernest and Julia; and Ludwig and Lisa.

==Versions of the text==
The published vocal score for &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; was available within days of opening night, and it included all of the music performed at the premiere. Shortly thereafter, there were a number of substantial cuts, which were reflected in the published libretto. It is uncertain whether Sullivan (who was travelling abroad) agreed with these cuts, but the published vocal score was never revised. The libretto and vocal score have thus remained in disagreement.

The cuts involving the music included:
* One verse of No. 10, &quot;As o&#x27;er our penny roll we sing&quot;
* Several passages in the Act I finale
* No. 21, &quot;Come bumpers – aye, ever-so-many&quot;
* No. 27, &quot;Take my advice – when deep in debt&quot;
* No. 28a, &quot;Well you&#x27;re a pretty kind of fellow&quot;

There is no standard performing version of &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;. While most companies that have produced &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; agree that the first-night version is too long, there is no established tradition about which cuts to make, if any, and most productions have made cuts in the dialogue and often dropped verses and/or attempted some reorganization or rewriting.

The 1976 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording observed the original cuts in Act I, but restored the three deleted numbers from Act II.

==Recordings==
Until the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company recorded this opera in 1976, it was unfamiliar to most fans of Gilbert and Sullivan. While the 1976 recording has been well-received, the 1973 recording by UMGASS, though an amateur recording, including dialogue, is admired. The BBC had broadcast the opera with an excellent cast and including dialogue in 1966, but they have never released the recording. The 2012 professional production at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival was recorded on video.

<doc id="988523" wikidata="Q191683" url="?curid=988523" title="Demoiselle crane">
<text>The demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) is a species of crane found in central Eurosiberia, ranging from the Black Sea to Mongolia and Northeast China. There is also a small breeding population in Turkey. These cranes are migratory birds. Birds from western Eurasia will spend the winter in Africa while the birds from Asia, Mongolia and China will spend the winter in the Indian subcontinent. The bird is symbolically significant in the culture of India, where it is known as &quot;koonj&quot; or &quot;kurjaa&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The demoiselle crane was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons and cranes in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea virgo&quot;. He specified the type locality as the orient but this has been restricted to India. Linnaeus cited the accounts by earlier authors. The English naturalist Eleazar Albin had described and illustrated the &quot;Numidian crane&quot; in 1738. Albin explained that: &quot;This Bird is called Demoiselles by reason of certain ways of acting that it has, wherein it seems to imitate the Gestures of a Woman who affects a Grace in her Walking, Obeisances, and Dancing&quot;. Linnaeus also cited the English naturalist George Edwards who had described and illustrated the &quot;Demoiselle of Numidia&quot; in 1750. The name &quot;la demoiselle de Numidie&quot; had been used in 1676 by the French naturalist Claude Perrault. The demoiselle crane is now placed in the genus &quot;Grus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is treated as monospecific: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Grus&quot; is the Latin word for a &quot;crane&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;virgo&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;maiden&quot;. Some authorities place this species together with the closely related blue crane (&quot;Grus paradisea&quot;) in the genus &quot;Anthropoides&quot;.

== Description ==
The demoiselle is long, tall and has a wingspan. It weighs . It is the smallest species of crane. The demoiselle crane is slightly smaller than the common crane but has similar plumage. It has a long white neck stripe and the black on the foreneck extends down over the chest in a plume.

It has a loud trumpeting call, higher-pitched than the common crane. Like other cranes it has a dancing display, more balletic than the common crane, with less leaping.

==Distribution and habitat==
The demoiselle crane breeds in central Eurasia from the Black Sea east to Mongolia and northeast China. It breeds in open habitats with sparse vegetation, usually near water. In winter it migrates either to the Sahel region of Africa, from Lake Chad eastwards to southern Ethiopia, or to western regions of the Indian subcontinent. There was previously a small population in Turkey and an isolated resident population in the Atlas Mountains of northwest Africa. These are both now extinct. On its Indian wintering grounds it forms large flocks which gather on agricultural land. It roosts at night in shallow open water.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Eggs are laid between April and May. The minimal nest is placed on an open patch of grass or bare ground. The clutch is normally two eggs. These are laid at daily intervals and incubation begins after the first egg. Incubation is by both sexes but mainly by the female. The eggs hatch asynchronously after 27 to 29 days. The chicks are pale brown above and greyish white below. They are fed and cared for by both parents. The fledgeling period is between 55 and 65 days. They first breed when they are two years old.

==In culture==
The demoiselle crane is known as the &quot;koonj&quot;/&quot;kurjan&quot; in the languages of North India, and figure prominently in the literature, poetry and idiom of the region. Beautiful women are often compared to the &quot;koonj&quot; because its long and thin shape is considered graceful. Metaphorical references are also often made to the &quot;koonj&quot; for people who have ventured far from home or undertaken hazardous journeys.

The name &quot;koonj&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;kraunch&quot;, which is a cognate Indo-European term for &quot;crane&quot; itself. In the ancient story of Valmiki, the composer of the Hindu epic Ramayana, it is claimed that his first verse was inspired by the sight of a hunter kill the male of a pair of demoiselle cranes that were courting. Observing the lovelorn female circling and crying in grief, he cursed the hunter in verse. Since tradition held that all poetry prior to this moment had been revealed rather than created by man, this verse concerning the demoiselle cranes is regarded as the first human-composed meter.

The flying formation of the &quot;koonj&quot; during migrations also inspired infantry formations in ancient India. The Mahabharata epic describes both warring sides adopting the &quot;koonj&quot; formation on the second day of the Kurukshetra War.

<text>DNA gyrase, or simply gyrase, is an enzyme within the class of topoisomerase and is a subclass of Type II topoisomerases that reduces topological strain in an ATP dependent manner while double-stranded DNA is being unwound by elongating RNA-polymerase or by helicase in front of the progressing replication fork. It is the only known enzyme to actively contribute negative supercoiling to DNA, while it also is capable of relaxing positive supercoils. It does so by looping the template to form a crossing, then cutting one of the double helices and passing the other through it before releasing the break, changing the linking number by two in each enzymatic step. This process occurs in bacteria, whose single circular DNA is cut by DNA gyrase and the two ends are then twisted around each other to form supercoils. Gyrase is also found in eukaryotic plastids: it has been found in the apicoplast of the malarial parasite &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; and in chloroplasts of several plants. Bacterial DNA gyrase is the target of many antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, novobiocin, albicidin, and ciprofloxacin.

The unique ability of gyrase to introduce negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis is what allows bacterial DNA to have free negative supercoils. The ability of gyrase to relax positive supercoils comes into play during DNA replication and prokaryotic transcription. The helical nature of the DNA causes positive supercoils to accumulate ahead of a translocating enzyme, in the case of DNA replication, a DNA polymerase. The ability of gyrase (and topoisomerase IV) to relax positive supercoils allows superhelical tension ahead of the polymerase to be released so that replication can continue.

==Gyrase structure==

DNA gyrase is a tetrameric enzyme that consists of 2 GyrA (&quot;A&quot;) and 2 GyrB (&quot;B&quot;) subunits. Structurally the complex is formed by 3 pairs of &quot;gates&quot;, sequential opening and closing of which results into the direct transfer of DNA segment and introduction of 2 negative supercoils. N-gates are formed by ATPase domains of GyrB subunits. Binding of 2 ATP molecules leads to dimerization and, therefore, closing of the gates. Hydrolysis, on the contrary, opens them. DNA cleavage and reunion is performed by a catalytic center located in DNA-gates build by all gyrase subunits. C-gates are formed by GyrA subunits.

==Mechanochemical model of gyrase activity==

A single molecule study has characterized gyrase activity as a function of DNA tension (applied force) and ATP, and proposed a mechanochemical model. Upon binding to DNA (the &quot;Gyrase-DNA&quot; state), there is a competition between DNA wrapping and dissociation, where increasing DNA tension increases the probability of dissociation. According to the catalytic cycle proposed, binding of 2 ATP molecules causes dimerization of ATPase domains of GyrB subunits and capturing of a T-segment of DNA (T- from &quot;transferring&quot;) in a cavity between GyrB subunits. On a next step the enzyme cleaves a G-segment of DNA (G- from &quot;gate&quot;) making a double-strand break. Then the T-segment is transferred through the break, which is accompanied by the hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule. DNA-gyrase ligates the break in a G-segment back and T-segment finally leaves the enzyme complex. Hydrolysis of the second ATP returns the system to the initial step of a cycle.
As the result of a catalytic cycle two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and two negative supercoils are introduced into the DNA template. The number of superhelical turns introduced into an initially relaxed circular DNA has been calculated to be approximately equal to the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed by gyrase. Therefore, it can be suggested that two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per cycle of reaction by gyrase, leading to the introduction of a linking difference of -2.

==Gyrase specificity==
Gyrase has a pronounced specificity to DNA substrates. Strong gyrase binding sites (SGS) were found in some phages (bacteriophage Mu group) and plasmids (pSC101, pBR322). Recently, high throughput mapping of DNA gyrase sites in the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; genome using Topo-Seq approach revealed a long (≈130 bp) and degenerate binding motif that can explain the existence of SGSs. The gyrase motif reflects wrapping of DNA around the enzyme complex and DNA flexibility. It contains two periodic regions in which GC-rich islands are alternated with AT-rich patches by a period close to the period of DNA double helix (≈10.5 bp). The two regions correspond to DNA binding by C-terminal domains of GyrA subunits and resemble eukaryotic nucleosome binding motif.

==Inhibition by antibiotics==
Gyrase is present in prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, but the enzymes are not entirely similar in structure or sequence, and have different affinities for different molecules. This makes gyrase a good target for antibiotics. Two classes of antibiotics that inhibit gyrase are:

*The aminocoumarins (including novobiocin and Coumermycin A1), which work by competitive inhibition of energy transduction of DNA gyrase by binding to the ATPase active site on the GyrB subunit.
*The quinolones (including nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) are known as topoisomerase poisons. By binding to the enzyme they trap it in a transient step of the catalytic cycle, preventing the reunion of a G-segment. This results in an accumulation of double-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks and cell death. Quinolone-resistant bacteria frequently harbor mutated topoisomerases that resist quinolone binding.

The subunit A is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as oxolinic and nalidixic acids. The subunit B is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as coumermycin A1 and novobiocin. Inhibition of either subunit blocks supertwisting activity.

==Phage T4==

Phage T4 genes 39, 52 and 60 encode proteins that form a DNA gyrase that is employed in phage DNA replication during infection of the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacterial host. The phage gene 52 protein shares homology with the bacterial gyrase gyrA subunit and the phage gene 39 protein shares homology with the gyrB subunit. Since the host &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA gyrase can partially compensate for the loss of the phage gene products, mutants defective in either genes 39, 52 or 60 do not completely abolish phage DNA replication, but rather delay its initiation. Mutants defective in genes 39, 52 or 60 show increased genetic recombination as well as increased base-substitution and deletion mutation suggesting that the host compensated DNA synthesis is less accurate than that directed by wild-type phage. A mutant defective in gene 39 also shows increased sensitivity to inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation during the stage of phage infection after initiation of DNA replication when multiple copies of the phage chromosome are present.

<text>Croissy-sur-Seine (, literally &quot;Croissy on Seine&quot;) is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It is a suburban town on the western outskirts of Paris.

Croissy contains the two campuses of the British School of Paris, and was Russia&#x27;s base camp for UEFA Euro 2016.

==Geography==
Croissy is located on a loop of the river Seine, which forms its eastern, southern, and western boundaries. Croissy&#x27;s landward neighbours are Chatou, Le Vésinet, and Le Pecq.
* Area: 
* Average altitude: 26 m

==Population==
==Features==
The &quot;centre-ville&quot; provides a reasonable number of shops from bakeries to banks. An active morning market takes place on Fridays and Sundays.

There are several parks, some situated on the islands in the Seine. The commune is home to the 13th century chapel of St Leonard, situated near the banks of the Seine.

The &quot;Musée de la Grenouillère&quot; brings to life the famous floating café &quot;La Grenouillère&quot; where Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir met at the end of the summer of 1869 to paint their first Impressionist paintings. The museum presents a collection of paintings, engravings and objects in a beautiful era atmosphere and organizes exhibitions.

==Transport==
In good traffic conditions, the centre of Paris is 20 minutes from Croissy; in daily commuting conditions, it can take up to one hour.

Croissy is not directly served by rail transportation since the commune wants to keep the area residential. The nearest RER station is Chatou–Croissy (on the RER A line St Germain branch). The nearest SNCF service is at Bougival.

==Education==

Public schools in the commune include:

Preschools:
* Écoles maternelle Les Cerisiers
* Écoles maternelle Jean Moulin

Elementary schools:
* École primaire Jules Verne

<text>The 1930 Canadian federal election was held on July 28, 1930, to elect members of the House of Commons of the 17th Parliament of Canada. Richard Bedford Bennett&#x27;s Conservative Party won a majority government, defeating the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

3,922,481 votes were cast in this election.

== Background ==

The first signs of the Great Depression were clearly evident by the 1930 election, and Conservative party leader Richard Bennett campaigned on a platform of aggressive measures in order to combat it.

Part of the reason for Bennett&#x27;s success lay in the Liberals&#x27; own handling of the rising unemployment of 1930. Touting the Liberal formula as the reason for the economic prosperity of the 1920s, for example, left the Liberals carrying much of the responsibility, whether deserved or not, for the consequences of the crash of the American stock market.
King was apparently oblivious to the rising unemployment that greeted the 1930s, and continued to laud his government&#x27;s hand in Canada&#x27;s prosperity. Demands for aid were met with accusations of being the part of a great &quot;Tory conspiracy,&quot; which led King to make his famous &quot;five-cent piece&quot; outburst, alienating a growing number of voters. In retrospect, one can understand King&#x27;s reasoning. Both the Western mayors and provincial Premiers who had visited King with requests of relief were overwhelmingly Conservative: in the Premiers&#x27; case, seven out of nine. King concluded in Parliamentary debates that though aid was a provincial jurisdiction, the fact that he believed there to be no unemployment problem meant that the requests from the provinces appeared to be nothing more than political grandstanding. The Federal Conservatives had certainly exaggerated the Depression in its early stages solely to attack King&#x27;s government.

Several other factors entered into King&#x27;s defeat. Although obtaining funds from sometimes dubious sources was not a problem, the Liberal election machine was not as efficient as it once was, primarily due to the cause of the age and poor health of many chief strategists. King&#x27;s campaign was the epitome of Murphy&#x27;s law: every campaign stop appeared to meet the Prime Minister with some kind of mishap.

By contrast, Bennett&#x27;s Conservatives were electric. The self-made man who led them had practically rebuilt his party (a significant part of it with his own funds) and developed an election machine which could rival the Liberals&#x27;. Aside from superior party organization, the Tories used it. They bought out newspapers in key areas (notably the Liberal strongholds of the West, and Quebec) and ensured that pro-Tory slants were kept. In the first election where radio played an important role, Bennett&#x27;s vibrant, zealous voice was extremely preferable to King&#x27;s. (The Tory machine, of course, ensured that only the best radio spots were available to Bennett.)

Also, Bennett&#x27;s tariff policy, epitomized by his infamous promise to &quot;blast&quot; Canada&#x27;s way into world markets, was extremely well received in the key Liberal strongholds of the West and Quebec. In the West, agricultural production had been hurt by worldwide overproduction, and certain agricultural groups in Quebec firmly endorsed Bennett&#x27;s tariff policy. Bennett&#x27;s Conservatives won much of the former Progressive and Farmers&#x27; vote in the West, and they were elected with 44% of the popular vote in Quebec as a protest vote.

All those factors led to Bennett&#x27;s eventual election.

Canadian voters agreed with Bennett and the Conservatives were elected with a majority of 137 seats in the House Of Commons. The incumbent Liberals under William Lyon Mackenzie King became the official opposition after being reduced to 89.

The Progressives continued their decline, winning only three seats. The United Farmers of Alberta did somewhat better - despite finishing third place in the popular vote in that province they managed to hold on to nine of its seventeen seats (of which the UFA only contested ten). This would be the last federal election the Progressives or the UFA would win any seats.

Unfortunately for Bennett and the Conservatives, the Depression brought complex problems to politicians and extreme hardship for most Canadians. Bennett and the Conservatives lost the 1935 election to the Liberals under the previous Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, and the Conservatives would not return to government until 1957.

<text>Frederick Septimus Kelly (29 May 1881 – 13 November 1916) was an Australian and British musician and composer and a rower who competed for Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during WWI and, after surviving the Gallipoli campaign, he was killed in action in the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
Kelly, the fourth son and seventh child of Irish-born woolbroker Thomas Hussey Kelly and his wife Mary Anne, née Dick, was born in 1881 at 47 Phillip Street, Sydney. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, then went with his family to England and was educated at Eton College, where he stroked the school eight to victory in the Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta in 1899.

Kelly studied music at Eton under Charles Harford Lloyd and was awarded a Lewis Nettleship musical scholarship at Oxford in 1899. At Balliol College, Oxford (BA, 1903; MA, 1912), he was mentored by Donald Tovey and became president of the university musical club and a leading spirit at the Sunday evening concerts at Balliol. He was a protégé of Ernest Walker.

==Rowing==
Kelly took up sculling while at Oxford and won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley in 1902, beating Raymond Etherington-Smith in the final.

He rowed in the four seat for Oxford against Cambridge in the 1903 Boat Race. Oxford lost the race by six lengths. Kelly went on to win the Diamond sculls at Henley again that summer, beating Julius Beresford in the final. He also won the Wingfield Sculls, the Amateur Championship of the Thames, beating the holder Arthur Cloutte. This was the only occasion on which he entered.

On leaving Oxford in 1903, he started rowing at Leander Club and was in the Leander crews, which won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1903, 1904, and 1905 and the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup in 1906. In 1905, he won the Diamond Sculls again, beating Harry Blackstaffe. His time on this occasion was 8 min. 10 sec. stood as a record for over 30 years.

Kelly&#x27;s last appearance in a racing boat was in 1908 when he competed at the London Olympic Games. He was a member of the Leander crew in the eights, which won the gold medal for Great Britain.

Contemporary reports of Kelly&#x27;s oarsmanship were glowing: &#x27;his natural sense of poise and rhythm made his boat a live thing under him&#x27;; &#x27;Many think [Kelly] the greatest amateur stylist of all time&#x27;.

== Health ==
In 1907, Kelly became worried about problems with his hands and arms that were impeding his performance, especially as a musician. He also developed a facial tic. He sought hypnotherapeutic treatment for this condition from J. Milne Bramwell, the specialist medical hypnotist in London. He attended Bramwell&#x27;s rooms for treatment over an extended time.

==Musician==
After leaving Oxford with fourth-class honours in history, Kelly studied composition with Iwan Knorr and piano with Ernst Engesser at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. On his return to London in 1908 he acted as an adviser to the Classical Concert Society. He used his influence in favour of the recognition of modern composers. At this time, he met and became a close friend of Leonard Borwick, probably England&#x27;s finest pianist at the time. In 1911, he visited Sydney and gave some concerts, and in 1912 took part in chamber music concerts in London. He performed with Pablo Casals. He helped organise a concert in London by Maurice Ravel, on 17 December 1913 at the Bechstein Hall. At the concert, Kelly played four solo piano pieces by Alexander Scriabin and performed the &quot;Phantasy&quot; piano quintet by James Friskin, with the English String Quartet.

==Wartime==
Following the outbreak of war in 1914, Kelly was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve for service with the Royal Naval Division with his friends—the poet Rupert Brooke, the critic and composer William Denis Browne, and others of what became known as the Latin Club.

Kelly was wounded twice at Gallipoli, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and reached the rank of lieutenant commander. At Gallipoli, he wrote his scores in his tent at base camp, including his tribute to Brooke, &quot;Elegy for String Orchestra: &quot;In Memoriam Rupert Brooke&quot;&quot; (1915), conceived in the wake of Brooke&#x27;s death. Kelly was among the party who buried him on Skyros.

The following is a description of Kelly&#x27;s close connection to Brooke, taken from
&quot;Race Against Time: the Diaries of F.S. Kelly&quot;:

Kelly returned to active service after Gallipoli and died at Beaucourt-sur-l&#x27;Ancre, France, when rushing a German machine gun post in the last days of the Battle of the Somme in November 1916. He was 35. Kelly is the only one of the dozen composers killed at the Somme to have a marked grave. His men retrieved his body and carried it back through No Man&#x27;s Land. He was buried in Martinsart&#x27;s British Cemetery not far from where he fell at the age of 35.

==Posthumous renown==
Kelly&#x27;s final piece was the &quot;Somme Lament&quot;, completed in October 1916, just two weeks before he died during the Somme campaign. It was completed in piano score. Christopher Latham orchestrated the work for a 2020 recording. At the memorial concert held at the Wigmore Hall, London on 2 May 1919, some of his piano compositions were played by Leonard Borwick, and some of his songs were sung by Muriel Foster. The centrepiece of the concert was the &quot;Elegy for String Orchestra&quot;, written at Gallipoli in memory of Rupert Brooke, a work of profound feeling. Frank Bridge was the conductor – he had conducted its first performance at Rugby School on 28 March 1916.

On 6th March 1918, Fellow Australian composer Ernest Truman played a tribute in memorial to Frederick Septimus Kelly written by his former tutor Charles Harford Lloyd. 

Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Flute&quot; with accompaniment of Harp, Horn, and String Orchestra (Op. 7), written in 1911, received its first recording 100 years after he composed it, by the Canadian flautist Rebecca Hall for Cameo Classics. José Garcia Gutierrez was the horn soloist with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by its Musical Director, Michael Laus.

His piano works include the 12 Studies, Op. 9 (1907–13) and 24 Monographs, Op. 11 (1911–16) in all the major and minor keys, as well as a set of etudes, modelled on Chopin and Scriabin. The Preludes and Monographs have been recorded by Alex Wilson. There are two recordings of the Violin Sonata &quot;Gallipoli&quot; from 1915. In 2023 Toccata issued first performance recordings of three chamber music works: the first Violin Sonata in D minor (1901), the Piano Trio (1905), and the Serenade for flute and piano, Op.7 (1911).

==Family==
Unmarried, he had lived at his home, Bisham Grange, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, with his sister Mary (Maisie). There is a memorial to him in the village of Bisham. His elder brother, William Henry &quot;Willie&quot; Kelly, was a politician who held the seat of Wentworth in the Australian House of Representatives from 1903 to 1919.

Kelly&#x27;s papers are held in the National Library of Australia.

<text>The Tybee Island mid-air collision was an incident on February 5, 1958, in which the United States Air Force lost a Mark 15 nuclear bomb in the waters off Tybee Island near Savannah, Georgia, United States. During a night practice exercise, an F-86 fighter plane collided with the B-47 bomber carrying the large weapon.

The bomb was jettisoned to help prevent a crash and explosion. After several unsuccessful searches, the weapon was declared lost in Wassaw Sound off the shores of Tybee Island.

== Collision ==
The B-47 bomber was on a simulated combat mission from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, carrying a single bomb. At about 2:00 a.m. EST &quot;(UTC−5)&quot;, an F-86 fighter collided with the six-engine B-47. The F-86 pilot, Lt. Clarence Stewart, ejected and parachuted to safety near Estill, South Carolina, north of the fighter&#x27;s crash site east of Sylvania, Georgia. The damaged B-47 remained airborne, plummeting from until the pilot, Col. Howard Richardson, regained control at .

The crew requested permission to jettison the bomb, in order to reduce weight and prevent the weapon from exploding during an emergency landing. Permission was granted, and the bomb was jettisoned at , while the plane was traveling at about . The crew did not see an explosion when the weapon struck the sea. They managed to land the B-47 successfully at nearby Hunter Air Force Base, just south of Savannah. Richardson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for safely landing the bomber.

== The bomb ==

Some sources describe the bomb as a functional nuclear weapon, but others refer to it as disabled. If it had a plutonium nuclear core installed, it was a fully functional weapon. If it had a dummy core installed, it was incapable of generating a nuclear blast but could still produce a conventional explosion. in length, the Mark 15 bomb that was lost weighs , bears the serial number 47782, and contains of conventional high explosives and highly enriched uranium.

The Air Force maintains that its &quot;nuclear capsule&quot; (physics package), used to initiate the nuclear reaction, was removed before its flight aboard the B-47. As noted in the Atomic Energy Commission &quot;Form AL-569 Temporary Custodian Receipt (for maneuvers)&quot;, signed by the aircraft commander, the bomb contained a simulated cap made of lead.

However, according to 1966 Congressional testimony by Assistant Secretary of Defense W.J. Howard, the Tybee Island bomb was a &quot;complete weapon, a bomb with a nuclear capsule&quot; and one of two weapons lost that contained a plutonium trigger. Nevertheless, a study of the Strategic Air Command documents indicates that Alert Force test flights in February 1958 with the older Mark 15 payloads were not authorized to fly with nuclear capsules on board. Such approval would not come until safer &quot;sealed-pit nuclear capsule&quot; weapons began to be deployed in June 1958.

== Recovery efforts ==
Starting on February 6, 1958, the Air Force 2700th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Squadron and 100 Navy personnel equipped with hand-held sonar and galvanic drag and cable sweeps mounted a search. On April 16, the military announced the search had been unsuccessful. Based on a hydrographic survey in 2001, the bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried under of silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound.

In 2004, retired Air Force Lt. Colonel Derek Duke claimed to have narrowed the possible resting spot of the bomb down to a small area approximately the size of a football field. He and his partner located the area by trawling in their boat with a Geiger counter in tow. Secondary radioactive particles four times naturally occurring levels were detected and mapped, and the site of radiation origination triangulated. An Air Force nuclear weapons adviser speculated that the source of the radiation was natural, originating from deposits of monazite, a locally occurring mineral that emits radiation.

== Later effects ==
By 2007, no undue levels of unnatural radioactive contamination have been detected in the regional Upper Floridan aquifer by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (over and above the already high levels thought to be due to monazite).

==In popular culture==
In February 2015, an article appeared on a fake news web site which claimed that the bomb had been found by vacationing Canadian divers and had been removed from the bay. The spurious story spread widely via social media.

In the MonsterVerse graphic novel &quot;Godzilla Dominion&quot;, the Titan named Scylla finds the sunken warhead off the coast of Savannah, Georgia, having sensed its radiation as a potential food source. Godzilla and the Coast Guard force Scylla to retreat, and they safely recover the bomb.

<text>Enniscrone – also spelt Inniscrone and officially named Inishcrone () – is a small seaside town in County Sligo, Ireland. Its sandy beach, tourist campsite, and golf course all attract visitors. As of the 2022 census, the town had a population of 1,291 people.

==Name==
The majority of the local population know this village as Enniscrone, though some local school teachers and historians use the official name of &quot;Inishcrone&quot;. Sligo County Council has neglected the official version in favour of &quot;Enniscrone&quot; which appears on their website, and at least one local newspaper does not use the official name. Locally, the road signs are one of the few places &quot;Inniscrone&quot; can be seen.

Up until the late 1970s the name &quot;Enniscrone&quot; was used by local teachers. It was taught as being a derivative of the Irish &quot;Inis Eascar Abhann&quot;, meaning &quot;the island on the sandbank in the river&quot;. An entry in the Placenames Database of Ireland suggests that there is no evidence for this derivation, and notes that the name may derive from &quot;Eiscir Abhann&quot;, meaning &quot;esker of the river&quot;.

==Geography==
Enniscrone is in County Sligo on Ireland&#x27;s Atlantic coast, overlooking Killala Bay. The R297 regional road passes through the town.

The area around Enniscrone includes the townlands of Muckduff, Lacken, Lacknaslevia, Frankford, Carrowhubbock North and Carrowhubbock South. Carrowhubbock South townland () is approximately in area and spans much of the centre and north of the town. Residential development plans in this part of Enniscrone met community opposition in 2007.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ringfort sites in the townlands of Muckduff, Frankford, and Carrowhubbock North and South. The ruins of a fortified house, known as Inishcrone Castle and built c.1650, lie just north of the town centre. The local Church of Ireland church was built c.1829, and a Roman Catholic church followed in 1892. The latter remained in use by the local Catholic congregation until a new church was built in 1965.
In &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;, published by Samuel Lewis in 1837, Enniscrone is described as having &quot;a coast-guard station [..and..] constabulary police station&quot;. This coast-guard station was destroyed in August 1920 following an IRA attack during the Irish War of Independence. There were no casualties in the attack, in which a small garrison of British Royal Marines were forced to surrender the building, arms and ammunition.

Reflecting the town&#x27;s development as a seaside resort, a number of bathhouses were built in the town in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Amenities==
Amenities in the area include a number of shops, pubs, restaurants, holiday accommodation and a pitch and putt course. The local primary school is a co-educational Catholic national school, which had an enrollment of over 120 pupils as of 2020. The local Kilglass/Enniscrone Soccer Club play their home games at Michael McGowan Park.

As of 2018, local man David McGowan had begun construction of a &quot;glamping&quot; village, with the main focus being the Boeing 767 he bought to convert into accommodation.

==Beach==

Enniscrone&#x27;s public sandy beach stretches over a long area of shoreline, and is split near the lower part of the village by a small crossable river. Part of the beach is overseen by lifeguards in the summer period.

The &quot;Valley of Diamonds&quot; is one of the hidden features along the beach, and is the largest of the &quot;volcano-like&quot; compositions among the long-grassed sand dunes. Sligo County Council fenced off the sand dunes as part of their &quot;Dune Restoration Works Programme&quot;. Other county council restrictions include limiting road access to the beach, a measure taken to maintain Enniscrone&#x27;s Blue Flag beach status.

<text>Mark Robert Jindrak (born June 26, 1977) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under his own name and for his appearances with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) under the ring name Marco Corleone. He is a former CMLL World Heavyweight Champion, CMLL World Trios Champion, and WCW World Tag Team Champion.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001)===
Jindrak trained in the WCW Power Plant under Paul Orndorff. He made his WCW debut on the March 2, 1999, taping of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, teaming with Chuck Palumbo as &quot;The Soul Surfers&quot; in a loss to Disorderly Conduct. He was promoted to the main WCW roster in June 2000 under the Vince Russo era where he formed a tag team with fellow Power Plant graduate Sean O&#x27;Haire. In August 2000, Jindrak and O&#x27;Haire helped form The Natural Born Thrillers with Mike Sanders, Shawn Stasiak, Chuck Palumbo, Johnny &quot;The Bull&quot; Stamboli, and Reno. They were briefly &quot;coached&quot; by Kevin Nash. In September 2000, Jindrak won the World Tag Team Championship with O&#x27;Haire for the first time, despite being relatively new in the business. The pair won the World Tag Team Championship once more before splitting in early January 2001 when Jindrak would begin teaming with Stasiak instead. The team was short-lived, as Stasiak went on to pick up the managerial service of Stacy Keibler and Jindrak was taken off of television.

===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===
====The Alliance and teaming with Garrison Cade (2001–2004)====
After the World Wrestling Federation purchased WCW in March 2001, Jindrak came into the company in July 2001 as part of The Alliance that invaded the WWF roster. Jindrak wrestled in dark matches and at house shows throughout July. His first televised debut was on the July 28, 2001, episode of &quot;WWF Jakked/Metal&quot;, defeating Jerry Lynn. In late August of that year Mark Jindrak was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association. There he was a member of Team WCW along with Mike Sanders, Johnny The Bull, Reno, Jason Jett, Lash LeRoux, Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, Kwee Wee, Elix Skipper, and Jamie Knoble. In October 2001 Jindrak was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for training until March 2002 when he suffered a knee injury. Jindrak returned to OVW in July 2002. He also returned to WWE on the October 13, 2002, episode &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; defeating Justin Credible. He made a few more appearances on &quot;Heat&quot; in late 2002, defeating wrestlers such as Credible, Raven and Stevie Richards until suffering an ankle injury. Jindrak returned to OVW in March 2003 following his recovery and joined Kenny Bolin&#x27;s &quot;Bolin Services&quot; stable and teamed with Garrison Cade while in OVW.

Jindrak was soon called up by WWE. Triple H would reveal on his 2013 &quot;Triple H - Thy Kingdom Come&quot; DVD that Jindrak was originally planned to be in Evolution alongside himself, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton. This claim was further confirmed by vignettes filmed that feature Jindrak with Evolution. However, for then-undisclosed reasons, his spot as the Arn Anderson-like enforcer of the group ended up going to Batista instead. This would be elaborated on in 2020 in the Evolution episode of the WWE Network series &quot;Ruthless Aggression&quot;, when it was revealed that Vince McMahon wanted Jindrak in the group to replace Batista due to his triceps injuries in 2003. However, Triple H felt that while Jindrak had the talent, he lacked the maturity for the group and felt that he was dragging Randy Orton down. Jindrak, who made his first WWE programming appearance in 15 years in the interview, agreed with Triple H&#x27;s assessment.

After being pulled out of the Evolution angle, Jindrak joined the Raw brand on July 7, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as a face against Chris Jericho in a losing effort. On the July 19 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Jindrak formed a tag team with Garrison Cade by defeating the World Tag Team Champions La Résistance in a non-title match, thus earning a title shot against La Résistance on the July 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; but failed to win the titles. They would become a staple in Raw&#x27;s tag team division by feuding with La Résistance, Evolution and The Dudley Boyz over the tag team titles. At Armageddon, Jindrak and Cade participated in a tag team turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship and eliminated The Hurricane and Rosey and the team of Val Venis and Lance Storm before being eliminated by Dudley Boyz. On the March 1, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jindrak and Cade defeated Rosey and The Hurricane to qualify for a fatal four-way match for the World Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XX, which they failed to win.

====Teaming and feuding with Luther Reigns (2004–2005)====

Jindrak&#x27;s team with Garrison Cade ended when Jindrak was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22, 2004. He made his debut as a member of SmackDown on the March 27 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, during which he appeared as &quot;The Reflection of Perfection&quot;, a narcissistic heel gimmick obsessed with his own physique, similar to Lex Luger&#x27;s &quot;Narcissist&quot; character. He defeated Tyson Dux in his first match as part of the SmackDown! roster. On April 8, 2004, Jindrak gained Theodore Long&#x27;s managerial services for a brief period until the pair split in July when Long turned face and became the general manager of SmackDown! while Jindrak remained on &quot;Velocity&quot;. Jindrak was initially pushed with an undefeated streak against the likes of Scotty 2 Hotty, Hardcore Holly, Shannon Moore, Spike Dudley, Orlando Jordan, Funaki and Billy Kidman during his first few months on the SmackDown! roster before suffering his first loss in three months against Charlie Haas on the July 3 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;.

In September, Jindrak aligned himself with Kurt Angle and Luther Reigns to assist Angle in assaulting and shaving Big Show bald during the fifth anniversary episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Jindrak and Reigns continued to serve as Kurt Angle&#x27;s proteges until February 2005, at which point they split from Angle to continue their own feud with The Undertaker. However, Jindrak and Reigns&#x27; team began to have a falling out, most notably after they lost to Undertaker in a &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; handicap match on the February 24, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; because of Jindrak submitting to a triangle choke. The following week, Jindrak and Reigns lost a Tag Team Championship match against Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio. Following the loss, Jindrak turned face by getting into a fight with Reigns and knocking him out with a left hook. On the March 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jindrak defeated Reigns in a singles match. After this, Jindrak became a low-card star who performed on &quot;Velocity&quot; and only appeared on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to job against other wrestlers, during which he alternated between face and heel alignments. On the May 28 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, Jindrak unsuccessfully faced Orlando Jordan for the United States Championship. He then wrestled his last match on the SmackDown! brand on the June 18 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, which he lost to René Duprée. On June 30, Jindrak became one of the last-minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, returning him back to the Raw brand. However, Jindrak never made his Raw re-debut, as he was released from his contract on July 5, 2005.

===Japan and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2006–2009)===
Following his departure from WWE, Jindrak toured New Japan Pro-Wrestling in 2006, where he was primarily used as a low-carder. He did, however, pick up a surprise win over long-time veteran Osamu Nishimura during the tour. Soon after, Jindrak began working for the Japanese promotion HUSTLE as &quot;Sodom&quot;, teaming with Gomorrah.

In late 2006, Jindrak began working for the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre under the name Marco Corleone. As a part of his new ring name, which he derived from &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Corleone also accentuated his Italian American heritage as a part of his new gimmick, which included allying with fellow WCW and WWE alumnus Johnny Stamboli. Initially a &quot;rudo&quot; (heel), Corleone turned into a &quot;technico&quot; (face) because of crowd support. In 2008, it was announced that Jindrak had been officially banned from performing at wrestling shows in Tijuana, Mexico, for a year due to pulling down the tights of his opponent during a match.

===AAA and Perros del Mal (2009–2010)===
On March 15, 2009, Jindrak, under his Marco Corleone ring name, made a surprise jump from CMLL to AAA, appearing as a surprise corner man for Vampiro during AAA&#x27;s 2009 Rey de Reyes show. Corleone helped Vampiro win the match against AAA&#x27;s top heel Konnan. On June 13, 2009, at Triplemanía XVII Corleone teamed with Latin Lover against La Hermandad 187 (Nicho El Millonario and Joe Líder) in a match for the World Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. On March 22, 2010, AAA released Jindrak. Corleone later stated that he had initially only signed a one-year contract with AAA and had declined to re-sign. On April 11, 2010, Mexican promotion Perros del Mal announced that they had signed Jindrak, still using the ring name Marco Corleone, to a contract.

===Lucha Libre USA (2010–2012)===
Corleone competed on MTV&#x27;s lucha libre show, &quot;Lucha Libre USA&quot;. He became involved with the promotion shortly after leaving AAA in early 2010, and was involved in finding and signing wrestlers for the show. On December 12, 2010, Corleone, Charly Malice and R. J. Brewer were defeated in a four-way elimination match by Lizmark, Jr., who became the inaugural Heavyweight Champion in the process. This episode aired on tape delay on October 1, 2011. On October 3, 2012, Corleone unsuccessfully challenged in a three-way match for the LLUSA Heavyweight Championship losing to R. J. Brewer and the match also included Lizmark Jr.

===Return to CMLL (2011–2018)===
On December 10, 2011, CMLL announced that Corleone would return to the promotion on December 16 at CMLL&#x27;s &quot;Sin Piedad&quot; show. In his return match, Corleone, Máximo and Rush defeated Mr. Niebla, Negro Casas and Rey Bucanero in two straight falls. After the event, the trio of Corleone, Rush and Máximo was given the name &quot;La Tercia Sensación&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;El Bufete del Amor&quot;. On February 19, 2012, &quot;El Bufete del Amor&quot; defeated &quot;Los Hijos del Averno&quot; (Averno, Ephesto and Mephisto) to win the World Trios Championship. On August 24, 2012, Corleone was defeated by Hiroshi Tanahashi in the quarterfinal round of the Universal Championship Tournament. In the fall of 2012 &quot;El Bufete&quot; began a feud against the Mexican National Trios Champions &quot;Los Invasores&quot; (Volador Jr., Mr. Águila and Kraneo). The two teams fought several occasions with &quot;El Bufete&quot;″s World Trios Championship on the line, while &quot;Los Invasores&quot;″ Mexican National Trios Championship being passed over was compared to the more prestigious CMLL title. Corleone was forced to team up with Kraneo for the 2013 &quot;Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles&quot; (&quot;National Incredible Pairs Tournament&quot;), a tag team tournament teaming up wrestlers who would never team up otherwise, often because they are rivals, would be forced to work together. The team lost to Shocker and Mr. Niebla in the opening round because of their inability to get along for only match. In May, Corleone was sidelined with a knee injury, leading to CMLL stripping him, Máximo and Rush of the World Trios Championship.

On August 2, 2013, Corleone returned from injury teaming with La Sombra and Rush defeating Averno, Mephisto and Volador Jr. in a two out of three falls match. On September 16, 2014, Corleone and Rush defeated El Terrible and Rey Escorpión to win La Copa CMLL. On December 7, Corleone was knocked unconscious during a match with El Terrible, after being hit on the back of the head by a ring rope. He regained consciousness shortly thereafter and was reportedly doing well. On March 17, 2015, Los Ingobernables (Corleone and Rush) unsuccessfully challenged Negro Casas and Shocker in a two out of three falls match for the World Tag Team Championship.

On June 6, 2017, Corleone defeated Euforia, Dragón Rojo Jr., El Terrible, Gran Guerrero, Kráneo, Mr. Niebla, Pierroth, Rey Bucanero and Rush in a &quot;torneo cibernetico&quot; elimination match to win the World Heavyweight Championship, the first singles title of his career. On June 18, Corleone made his first successful title defense against El Terrible. On August 22, 2018, Corleone had to vacate the title due to an injury and thus confirmed his departure from CMLL. Jindrak wrestled his final match to date on March 23, 2018.

==Other media==
Jindrak has appeared on several Mexican game shows, soap operas, television shows and magazine covers. He was also named &quot;Best Body in Mexico&quot;. In 2012, Jindrak starred in the Mexican telenovela &quot;Porque el amor manda&quot; as Ury Petrovsky. Jindrak tried out for the film &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, and was offered a role as a football player. As he was in training at the WCW Power Plant at the time however, he turned the role down.

Jindrak wrote a book in Spanish entitled &quot;Marco Corleone: las primera luchas de mi vida&quot; (Marco Corleone: the first fights of my life) for children, to help them cope with bullying in schools.

Jindrak has also made appearances in video games. He made an appearance in WWE Day of Reckoning, WWE SmackDown! vs Raw, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, AND 1 Streetball, and Lucha Libre AAA: Héroes del Ring.

His father is of German descent and his mother is of Italian descent. On November 3, 2015, Jindrak announced that he married Mexican fashion designer and model Miroslava Luna. Jindrak resides in Mexico with his wife and son.

In July 2016, Jindrak was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The case was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

<text>Rawalpindi District (Punjabi and ) is a district located in the northernmost part of the Punjab province of Pakistan. Parts of the district form part of the Islamabad Rawalpindi metropolitan area. Rawalpindi city is the district capital.

The district has an area of . Originally, its area was until the 1960s when Islamabad Capital Territory was carved out of the district, giving away an area of . It is situated on the southern slopes of the north-western extremities of the Himalayas, including large mountain tracts with rich valleys traversed by mountain rivers. The chief rivers are the Indus and the Jhelum, and it is noted for its milder climate and abundant rainfall due to its proximity to the foothills.

==History==

===Ancient history===

In ancient times the whole or the greater part of the area between the Indus and the Jhelum seems to have belonged to a Naga tribe called Takshakas, who gave their name to the city of Takshasila. Known as Taxila by the Greek historians, the location of the ancient city has been identified to be in the ruins of Shahdheri in the north-west corner of the District. 

At the time of Alexander&#x27;s invasion Taxila was described by Arrian as a flourishing city, known more for its tourism. Taxila having too weak army, locals of the city had immediately surrendered to Greek army without a battle; adds that the neighbouring country was crowded with inhabitants and was very fertile; and Pliny speaks of it as a famous city situated in a district called Amanda. The invasion of Demetrius in 195 B.C. brought the Punjab under the Graeco-Bactrian kings. Later they were superseded by the Sakas, who ruled at Taxila with the title of Satrap. At the time of Hiuen Tsiang (Chinese explorer), the city was a dependency of Kashmir.

===Muslim era===
Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi passed through the District after his defeat of Anandpal and capture of Ohind. The first mention of the Gakhars occurs in the memoirs of Babar, who gives an interesting account of the capture of their capital, Paralah. It was strongly situated in the hills, and was defended with great bravery by its chief Hati Khan, who escaped from one gate as the Mughal army marched in at the other. Hati Khan died by poison in 1525 ; his cousin and murderer Sultan Sarang then submitted to Babar, who conferred on him the area of Potwar. From that time on the Gakhar chieftains remained firm allies of the Mughal dynasty, and provided significant aid to the Mughal in their struggle against the house of Sher Shah. Salim Shah attempted in vain to subdue their country.

In 1553 Adam Khan, Sarang&#x27;s successor, surrendered the rebel prince Kamran to Humayun. Adam Khan was subsequently deposed by Akbar, and his principality given over to his nephew Kamal Khan. During the height of the Mughal empire, the family of Sarang retained its territorial possessions. Its last and Gakhars chief, Mukarrab Khan, ruled over a kingdom which extended from the Chenab to the Indus.

===British era===
In 1849 Rawalpindi passed with the rest of the Sikh dominions under British rule; and though tranquillity was disturbed by an insurrection four years later, led by a Gakhar chief with the object of placing a pretended son of Ranjit Singh on the throne, its administration was generally peaceful until the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857. The Dhunds and other tribes of the Murree Hills, incited by Hindustani agents, rose in insurrection, and the authorities received information from a faithful native of a projected attack upon the station of Murree in time to organise measures for defence. The women near the station, who were present in large numbers, were placed in safety, while the Europeans and police were drawn up in a cordon round the station. The rebels arrived expecting no resistance, but were met with organised resistance and were repelled.

The district of Rawalpindi was created during British rule as part of Punjab province. The district obtained its current boundaries in 1904 when Attock District was created as a separate district. According to the 1901 census of India the population in 1901 was 558,699, an increase of 4.7% from 1891.

<text>Bannu District (, ) is a district in the Bannu Division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Its status as a district was formally recorded in 1861 during the British Raj.

It is represented in the provincial assembly by four MPAs.

Cloth weaving, sugar mills and the manufacturing of cotton fabrics, machinery and equipment are the major industries in Bannu. It is also known for its weekly &quot;Jumma&quot; fair. The district forms a basin drained by the Kurram and Gambila (or Tochi) rivers, which originate in the hills of Waziristan. Although Bannu is surrounded by rugged and dry mountains, it is a fertile place, and early English visitors had been known to refer to it as a &quot;paradise&quot; – see the description by Edwardes quoted by Thornton.

Here, remnants bear witness to the presence of the most ancient village settlement within the Bannu region. This site witnessed occupation from the late fifth century to the early third millennium BC.

The sacred texts of Zend Avesta and Vendidad mentions Varəna, the Avestan predecessor of the name for Bannu, as one of the sixteen most beautiful and perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda. Bannu is the homeland and birthplace of Fereydun.

Malik Dilasa Khan had also fought a successful battle against the sikh empire. in which he killed one of the prominent Sikh Military commander Jai Singh Atariwala in the Battle of Bannu.

===British era (1861–1947)===
After the British annexation of Punjab, then including parts of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the valley was administered by Herbert Edwardes. As a result of his administration, the region became a source of strong support, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Although the valley itself was peaceful, it was subject to incursions from the Waziri tribes of the Tochi Valley and the neighbouring hills. The primary export of the region was wheat, Salt and alum were also quarried at Kalabagh.

As of 1911, the Indus had no bridges within the district, but was navigable for local boats throughout its course of .
===Bannu Jirga (1947)===

On 21 June 1947 in Bannu, a jirga was held by Pashtun leaders including Bacha Khan, his brother Chief Minister Dr Khan Sahib, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the Partition of India. The jirga declared the Bannu Resolution, which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution, in response to which the Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum for merging the province into Pakistan.

===Pashtun National Jirga (2022)===

On 11–14 March 2022, the Pashtun National Jirga was held at Mirakhel in Bannu District in order to defend the rights of the Pashtun people in the country. The critical issues which were faced by the Pashtuns were discussed during the jirga in a bid to suggest solutions to them.

Charsadda District (, ) is a district in the Peshawar Division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Prior to its establishment as a separate district in 1998, it was a tehsil within the Peshawar District. Mohamedzai Pashtuns make up the majority of the population of the district along with other minor tribes settled as well such as Uthmankhel, Mohmand, Kakakhel, Khattak. The district headquarter is the town of Charsadda, which was once part of the Peshawar ex-metropolitan region.

== Overview and history ==

The district lies between 34-03&#x27; and 34-38&#x27; north latitudes and 71-28&#x27; and 71-53&#x27; east longitudes. Charsadda is located in the west of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and is bounded by the Malakand District to the north, Mardan district to the east, Nowshera and Peshawar districts to the south and Mohmand district to the west. The district covers an area of 996 square kilometers.

Charsadda was once part of the kingdom of Gandhara. However, around 516 BC Gandhara became part of the seventh satrapy or province of the Achaemenid Empire and paid tribute to Darius the Great of Persia, until it was overthrown by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC.

After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, the Indian Emperor Chandragupta Maurya rose to power and brought Gandhara under his sway. According to a popular tradition, Emperor Ashoka built one of his stupas there. Actually, there were two stupas built by Ashoka, mentioned by the famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hieun Tsang, who visited it in 630 AD. Both were near the town of Po-Lu-Sha, one was outside the eastern gate of the town, and the other 20 li (10 km) northeast of it, on the mount Dantaloka. 

To the east, a Brahminical temple stood while to the north, a monastery was located. According to Buddhists, this monastery was the place where Buddha preached the Law. The name Gandhara went out of usage after Mahmud of Ghazni conquered the area and converted it to Islam in 1026.

===Bactrian Greeks===
This area was also ruled by the Bactrian Greeks between 250–125 BC which was succeeded by the Indo-Greek Kingdom who ruled until 10 AD.

===Shabqadar===
Shabqadar is a tehsil within the District Charsadda. It is north west of Peshawar. A fort was built here by the Sikhs called Sharkargarh. The town was burnt by the Mohmands in 1897. It has since been rebuilt.

===Bibi Syeda Dheri===

Bibi Syeda Dheri is a site half a mile to the north of Umarzai village in Charsadda tehsil. At this location, a mound rises to a height of . It is believed to be the site of the stupa erected to commemorate the conversion by Buddha of goddess Hariti who used to devour children of the locality. There is also a shrine of a lady saint Bibi Syeda.

===Shar-i-Napursan===

Shar-i-Napursan is an archaeological site in Charsadda tehsil near the village Rajjar. Excavations have unearthed two distinct settlements of the Buddhist period and two of the Muslim period. Coins of Menander, Hermaeus and Kanishka have been unearthed.

===Palatu Dheri===

Palatu Dheri is another archaeological site near Charsadda tehsil. A mile from Shar-i-Napursan is a mound which contains the remains of a stupa, which according to Hieun Tsiang, was built by one Deven. Some coins which connect them both to the first century AD have been unearthed. Other finds include the image of the goddess Kalika-devi. Three inscribed jars, which were presented by some laymen to &quot;the Community of the Four Quarters&quot;, are now in the Peshawar Museum.

===Charsadda===

The city of Charsadda originally known as Pushkalavati is mentioned in the Hindu epic story the Ramayana, where Bharata brings this new conquered city to one of his sons, Pushkala.

===Bala Hisar of Charsadda===

Bala Hisar was excavated twice by the head of the Archaeological Survey of India, Sir John Marshall, in 1902 and by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1958. According to the South Asian Archaeology Research Group of Bradford University, Wheeler suggested that Bala Hisar &quot;was founded by the Persians in the sixth century BC as a colony guarding the eastern edge of their empire&quot;.

Hope was born in Cooma, New South Wales. His father was a Presbyterian minister and his mother a teacher. He was educated partly at home and in Tasmania, where they moved in 1911. Three years later they moved to Sydney. He attended Fort Street High School, the University of Sydney whilst residing at St. Andrew&#x27;s College and then the University of Oxford on a scholarship. Returning to Australia in 1931 he then trained as a teacher, and spent some time drifting. He worked as a psychologist with the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry, and as a lecturer in Education and English at Sydney Teachers&#x27; College (1937–44).

He was a lecturer at the University of Melbourne from 1945 to 1950, and in 1951 became the first professor of English at the newly founded Canberra University College, later of the Australian National University (ANU) when the two institutions merged. At the ANU he and Tom Inglis Moore created the first full year course in Australian literature at an Australian university. He retired from the ANU in 1968 and was appointed Emeritus Professor.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1972 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1981 and awarded many other honours. He died in Canberra, having suffered dementia in his last years, and is buried at the Queanbeyan Lawn Cemetery.

==Poet and critic==
Although he was published as a poet while still young, &quot;The Wandering Islands&quot; (1955) was his first collection and all that remained of his early work after most of his manuscripts were destroyed in a fire. Its publication was delayed by concern about the effects of Hope&#x27;s highly-erotic and savagely-satirical verse on the Australian public. His frequent allusions to sexuality in his work caused Douglas Stewart to dub him &quot;Phallic Alec&quot; in a letter to Norman Lindsay. His influences were Pope and the Augustan poets, Auden, and Yeats. He was a polymath, very largely self-taught, and with a talent for offending his countrymen. He wrote a book of &quot;answers&quot; to other poems, including one in response to the poem &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; by Andrew Marvell.

The reviews he wrote in the 1940s and &#x27;50s were feared &quot;for their acidity and intelligence. If his reviews hurt some writers – Patrick White included – they also sharply raised the standard of literary discussion in Australia.&quot; However, Hope relaxed in later years. As poet Kevin Hart writes, &quot;The man I knew, from 1973 to 2000, was invariably gracious and benevolent&quot;.

Hope wrote in a letter to the poet and academic Catherine Cole: &quot;Now I feel I&#x27;ve reached the pinnacle of achievement when you equate me with one of Yeats&#x27;s &#x27;wild, wicked old men&#x27;. I&#x27;m probably remarkably wicked but not very wild, I fear too much ingrained Presbyterian caution&quot;. Cole suggests that Hope represented the three attributes that Vladimir Nabokov believed essential in a writer, &quot;storyteller, teacher, enchanter&quot;.

Hope&#x27;s editor and fellow critic was David Brooks who was responsible for posthumously publishing the Selected Poetry and Prose of AD Hope in January, 2000.

==Influence and impact==
Kevin Hart, reviewing Catherine Cole&#x27;s memoir of Hope, writes that &quot;When A. D. Hope died in 2000 at the age of 93, Australia lost its greatest living poet&quot;. Hart goes on to say that when once asked what poets could do for Australia, Hope replied &quot;oh not much, merely justify its existence&quot;.

In 1998 a celebration of his life and works, &quot;The Scythe Honed Fine&quot;, was published by the National Library of Australia.

==Private life==
In 1937 he married Penelope Robinson. They had a daughter, Emily, who predeceased her parents in 1979; and two sons, Andrew and Geoffrey, who survived him. Penelope died in 1988.

<text>Paul Michael London (born April 16, 1980) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW), where he performs as a wrestler and a producer. He is best known for his tenure in WWE.

After being trained at the Texas Wrestling Academy, London began competing for Ring of Honor where his high-risk offensive moves made him a fan favorite. He later competed for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Zero-One, and various independent promotions, winning numerous championships and won the ECWA Super 8 Tournament in 2003.

London made his debut in WWE in late 2003. In 2004 he began teaming with fellow cruiserweight Billy Kidman and they eventually went on to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. After Kidman retired from active competition, London formed a tag team with Brian Kendrick. After their split, London began competing in the cruiserweight division and won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. In late 2006, Kendrick returned and the two reformed as a team. London and Kendrick were managed by Ashley Massaro. London and Kendrick won the WWE Tag Team Championship, becoming the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions since the title&#x27;s creation and the World Tag Team Championship. The team split when Kendrick was drafted to the SmackDown brand in June 2008 and London was released later that year. In 2009, he returned to the independent circuit, competing for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he was one half of the former PWG World Tag Team Champions with partner El Generico under the team name ¡Peligro Abejas!.

==Early life==
London was born in Austin, Texas, and has two older brothers, Daniel and Jonathan. In 1996, Daniel was killed by a drunk driver at the age of nineteen. Jonathan is a music video director. London attended Westlake High School in Texas. He helped create the school&#x27;s first-ever wrestling team where he was the captain, first varsity letterman and previously held the record for the fastest pinfall time of 7.4 seconds but was broken by 2x State Champion and Austin Westlake Great Justin Wood at 6.9 seconds.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (2000–2003)===
After graduating from high school, London trained at several wrestling schools, including a trailer park in West Memphis, Arkansas and a school run by Ivan Putski in North Austin, Texas. He debuted in 2000. London made his first appearance at WCW Greed on March 18, 2001, as an audience member during the Diamond Dallas Page and Scott Steiner WCW World Heavyweight Championship match. He later enrolled in Shawn Michaels&#x27; wrestling school, the Texas Wrestling Academy, where he was trained by Rudy Gonzales. Early in his career, London made brief appearances in Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero1) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). London competed in Zero1 for several months on a match-by-match basis, beginning in January 2003, before turning down a contract. London was contacted by TNA after ROH&#x27;s one-year anniversary show, and told that they were interested in him doing some matches on a try-out basis. On February 12, 2003, he made his TNA debut in a Gauntlet match against Jerry Lynn, which he lost. London competed mainly in the company&#x27;s X Division, even earning shots at the NWA TNA X Division Championship. His last appearance in TNA was on June 18, 2003, at the TNA Anniversary show. He wrestled X Division Champion Chris Sabin for the title, only to lose due to interference from CM Punk. London has said that he viewed his time in TNA as a &quot;stepping stone&quot;, but knew that he did not want to be there long-term. London also made several appearances for East Coast Wrestling Association and won the 7th Annual ECWA Super 8 Tournament.

===Ring of Honor (2002–2003; 2013–2014)===
He made his debut in Ring of Honor (ROH) on March 30, 2002, in a match against Chris Marvel. He began a lengthy feud with Michael Shane during a tag team match for ROH contracts on July 27, 2002. During the bout, both Shane and London made simultaneous pinfalls on their opponent&#x27;s partners. The referee only counted for Shane, giving his team the victory, which led to London and Shane brawling. The two continued to feud over the next several months in matches such as Street Fights (where the crowd chanted &quot;please don&#x27;t die&quot; due to London&#x27;s high-risk offense), a Triple Threat match and a Gauntlet match.

On December 7, 2002, London won a tournament to capture the ROH Number One Contender&#x27;s Trophy, guaranteeing a match for the ROH Championship. He lost the match three weeks later to then-champion Xavier. On February 8, 2003, London competed in a Triple Threat match for the Number One Contender&#x27;s Trophy, pinning A.J. Styles for the win. After the match, Xavier informed London that he would compete for the title immediately. London again lost to the champion. London&#x27;s final match in ROH was for the title against Samoa Joe on July 19, 2003, in which he lost.

On May 4, 2013, London made his first appearance for ROH in a decade, facing Davey Richards in a losing effort at Border Wars 2013. London suffered a stinger and concussion during the match and was as a result forced to pull out of the following day&#x27;s tapings of &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot;. London returned to ROH on August 3, losing to Michael Elgin in the first round of a tournament for the ROH World Championship. London returned once again at Glory By Honor XII to defeat Roderick Strong. London would make four additional appearances for ROH in 2014; London competed on the Supershow of Honor events in the United Kingdom.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2008)===

==== Championship reigns (2003–2005) ====
London signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in mid–2003, working a few dark matches before being sent to the company&#x27;s developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling, on August 30. London made his official WWE television debut on the SmackDown! brand, losing to Brock Lesnar in a match for the WWE Championship on October 9. After the match, Lesnar continued to attack London until fellow cruiserweight Spanky (Brian Kendrick) made the save. The two competed as a tag team on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;″s sister show &quot;Velocity&quot; until Spanky left the company in January 2004.
London then began a tag team with Billy Kidman on January 29, 2004. On the July 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz. They defended the title against the Dudleys and the Basham Brothers on several occasions before losing the championship to René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki on September 9, due to Kidman leaving London to fight by himself. Kidman&#x27;s heel turn led to a feud between the two, which culminated at No Mercy where Kidman defeated London with a shooting star press. After the match, London was bleeding from the mouth and being stretchered when Kidman pulled him back into the ring with the stretcher and delivered another shooting star press to London&#x27;s injured ribs. This storyline was put in place after London had broken his nose wrestling Booker T and needed time off to recuperate.

London returned on November 27, wrestling on &quot;Velocity&quot; until the end of the year. On March 10, 2005, London became the number one contender for Chavo Guerrero&#x27;s WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which he later won in a cruiserweight battle royal. Guerrero challenged London for the title at Judgment Day, where London emerged victorious. During another title match with Guerrero on June 23, The Mexicools stormed the ring, attacking both London and Guerrero. On the July 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, London teamed with Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki to face The Mexicools. The ending of the match saw Juventud perform the 450° splash on London for the win, but landed his knee onto London&#x27;s face and legitimately broke his nose in the process. London lost the Cruiserweight Championship on the August 6 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; to Nunzio. Later in the night, London cut a heel promo encouraging the fans to protest his title loss. London went on a losing streak before returning as a face and teaming with the newly rehired Brian Kendrick.

====Teaming with Brian Kendrick (2005–2008)====

On the December 16 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, London and Kendrick remade their image, wearing theatrical masks to the ring and matching vests and shorts. On the April 7, 2006, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, London and Kendrick defeated WWE Tag Team Champions MNM in a non-title match. They developed a winning streak over the champions, including singles victories for both Kendrick and London over Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, respectively. London and Kendrick won the WWE Tag Team Championship at Judgment Day, marking consecutive victories for London and Kendrick over MNM. On August 11, K. C. James and Idol Stevens defeated the champions in a non-title match, igniting a feud between the two teams. During the rivalry, WWE Diva Ashley Massaro began accompanying London and Kendrick to the ring to act as a valet and combat the actions of James and Stevens&#x27; manager Michelle McCool.
They soon began a losing streak to the team of William Regal and Dave Taylor. Regal defeated both team members in singles matches and on the December 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kendrick and London lost a tag team match to the pair. As a result, they were scheduled to defend the championship against Regal and Taylor at Armageddon; at the event, the match was changed to a four-way ladder match also involving MNM and The Hardys. London and Kendrick won the match and retained the championship. On the January 12, 2007, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; London and Kendrick successfully retained their championship against Regal and Taylor in a traditional tag team match.

On February 2, London and Kendrick suffered a non-title loss to the rookie team Deuce &#x27;n Domino. A further tag team match loss and a singles loss for Kendrick to Deuce led to a championship match at No Way Out, in which London and Kendrick were victorious. They retained the championship against MNM on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on March 23, and then retained the championship against Deuce &#x27;n Domino again on April 13, after Deuce &#x27;n Domino were disqualified. In a rematch the following week on the April 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, London and Kendrick lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Deuce &#x27;n Domino. During the match London missed a moonsault from the ring apron to the floor kayfabe injuring his ribs, leaving Kendrick to battle Deuce &#x27;n Domino alone. London and Kendrick&#x27;s reign was the longest in the championship&#x27;s history at 331 days until it was surpassed by The New Day in 2016. Selling his storyline injured ribs, London was absent from physical action until the May 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when he defeated Domino in singles competition. London and Kendrick unsuccessfully competed for the titles on June 1 in a triple threat tag team match, which also involved Regal and Taylor, and lost a rematch on June 15 in a standard tag team match.

Both London and Kendrick were drafted to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007, during the Supplemental Draft. They won their debut match on &quot;Raw&quot; against The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team on June 18. Throughout July and August, they wrestled against The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team and Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch on &quot;Raw&quot;, and on September 3, they won a number one contender&#x27;s match for Cade and Murdoch&#x27;s World Tag Team Championship. At a house show in South Africa on September 5, London and Kendrick defeated Cade and Murdoch to win the World Tag Team Championship, only to lose it back in a rematch three days later. At the end of 2007, he was inactive due to a foot injury. London returned on the February 4, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when he and Kendrick lost to the team of Carlito and Santino Marella. On the March 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, London and Kendrick faced Umaga in a handicap match. During the match, Kendrick walked out and left London to get pinned; no dissension came of the incident, and London and Kendrick continued to team together. They unsuccessfully challenged Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes for the World Tag Team Championship on May 26.

The team came to an end when Kendrick was drafted back to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft in June. The following month, London was briefly involved in a storyline between Shawn Michaels, and Chris Jericho and Lance Cade, when Jericho and Cade used London as an example of what happened to those who idolized Michaels. London lost singles matches to both Jericho and Cade on &quot;Raw&quot;, before disappearing from television. London was released from his WWE contract on November 7, 2008.

===Independent circuit (2009–2018)===

London made his debut in Big Time Wrestling on February 28, 2009, defeating the BTW Champion Jason Styles by disqualification.

After the match, Kendrick turned on Moxley and re-formed his team with London, which led to a Loser Leaves Company tag team match between London and Kendrick and Jacobs and Jack Evans at the following day&#x27;s tapings of the &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; pay-per-view. In the end Jacobs forced Kendrick to tap out and as a result he was forced to leave Dragon Gate USA for good. After the match London was assaulted by Teddy Hart.

In December 2010, London began working for Lucha Libre USA as the masked Sydistiko, taking over the role previously held by T. J. Perkins. He teamed up with Rellik to defeat Dinastia (El Oriental and Tinieblas Jr.) on December 12, 2010.

On April 10, 2010, London defeated PWG mainstay El Generico in a singles match. On May 9, the two men teamed up to form a duo introduced as ¡Peligro Abejas! (literally translated as The Danger Bees) in the fourth annual &quot;DDT4&quot; eight-team tag tournament. After defeating &quot;The Professional&quot; Scott Lost and Chuck Taylor in the first round and Jay and Mark Briscoe in the semifinals, London and Generico defeated the Young Bucks in the finals of the tournament to win both DDT4 and the PWG World Tag Team Championship. Later in the year on December 11, 2010, ¡Peligro Abejas! successfully defended the PWG World Tag Team Championship against the ROH World Tag Team Champions The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). On April 9, 2011, London was forced to miss a PWG event, during which El Generico and London&#x27;s replacement, Ricochet, lost the PWG World Tag Team Championship back to The Young Bucks.

After a two-year absence from PWG, London returned to the promotion on March 22, 2013, defeating Kevin Steen during the first night of the &quot;All Star Weekend 9&quot;.

<text>Chitral District (; ) was a district in the Malakand Division of the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, from 14 August 1947 to 2018. It was the largest district in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, covering an area of 14,850 km2, before splitting into Upper and Lower Chitral Districts in 2018. It was the northernmost district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It shared a border with Gilgit-Baltistan to the east and with Swat and Dir districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the south. It also shared an international border with Afghanistan to the north and west. Afghanistan&#x27;s narrow strip of Wakhan Corridor separated Chitral from Tajikistan in the north.

== History ==

Chitral shares much of its history and culture with the neighbouring Hindu Kush territories of Gilgit-Baltistan, a region sometimes called &quot;Peristan&quot; because of the common belief in fairies (&quot;peri&quot;) inhabiting the high mountains.

The entire region that now forms the Chitral District was an independent monarchical state until 1895, when the British negotiated a treaty with its hereditary ruler, the Mehtar, under which Chitral became a semi-autonomous princely state within the Indian Empire. Chitral retained this status even after its accession to Pakistan in 1947, finally being made an administrative district of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, disestablishing the Princely State.

== Topography and access ==

Chitral is counted amongst the highest regions of the world, sweeping from 1,094 metres at Arandu to 7,726 metres at Tirichmir and packing over 40 peaks more than 6,100 metres in height. The terrain of Chitral is very mountainous, and Tirich Mir (25,289 feet), the highest peak of the Hindu Kush, rises in the north of the district. Around 4.8 percent of the land is covered by forest, and 76 percent is mountains and glaciers.

Chitral is connected to the rest of Pakistan by two major road routes, the Lowari Pass ( elevation. 10,23 ft.) from Dir and Shandur Top (elevation 12,200 ft.) from Gilgit. Both routes used to be closed in winter, but circa 2017 the highway Lowari Tunnel under the Lowari Pass opened to vehicular traffic for at least ten hours per day. A number of other high passes, including Darkot Pass, Thoi Pass, and Zagaran Pass, provide access on foot to Chitral from Gilgit-Baltistan.
* Arandu Pass, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan
* Broghol Pass, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan
* Dorah Pass, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan
* Darkot Pass, on the border between Chitral and Gupis-Yasin District
* Shandur Pass, on the border between Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan
* Lowari Pass, on the border between Chitral and upper Dir
* Lowari Tunnel, highway under Lowari Pass
* Thoi Pass, on the border between Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan
* Zagaran Pass, on the border between Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan

== Demographics ==
The district has a population of about 414,000. The general population is mainly made up of Kho people, who speak Khowar, which is also spoken in parts of Yasin, Gilgit, Dir, and Swat. Chitral is also home to the Kalash tribe, who live in Bumburet and two other remote valleys southwest of Chitral town. A few thousand Nuristani people are also known to live in Chitral.

The main language of the region is Khowar. There are also smaller communities of speakers of Arabic, Dameli, Gawar-Bati, Gujari, Kalasha, Kyrgyz, Katë, Madaklashti, Palula, Sarikoli, Wakhi, and Yidgha. Urdu has official status.

== Chitral City ==

The city of Chitral is the main city in the district and serves as its capital. It is situated on the west bank of the Chitral River (also known as the Kunar River) at the foot of Tirich Mir, which at 7,708 m (25,289 ft) is the highest peak of the Hindu Kush. Until 14 August 1947, it served as the capital of the princely state of Chitral.

== Administration == 
The district of Chitral is divided into twenty-four union councils and two tehsils:

* Chitral
* Mastuj

=== National Assembly ===
This district is represented by one elected MNA (Member of the National Assembly) in Pakistan National Assembly. Its constituency is NA-1.

<text>Dera Ismail Khan District (Urdu and , ), often abbreviated as D.I. Khan is a district in the Dera Ismail Khan division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The capital of the district is the town of Dera Ismail Khan. The district has an area of and a population of 1,822,916 as of the 2023 Census.
After the Second Anglo-Sikh war in 1849 the district was annexed by
the British as part of the Punjab and remained so until 1901 when the North West Frontier Province or NWFP (now renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was created.

== Geography ==
The district of Dera Ismail Khan is bounded on the North east by the Bhakkar and Dera Ghazi Khan districts of Punjab. Eastern portions of the district along the Indus river are characterized by fertile alluvial plains, while lands farther from the river consist of clay soil cut by ravines from rainfall. The district is bounded on the southwest by a thin strip of the South Waziristan district, which separates D.I Khan from the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain in the neighboring Baluchistan province. In the northwest is the Tank District.

D.I Khan is separated from the &quot;Marwat&quot; plains of the Lakki Marwat district by a spur of clay and sandstone hills that stretch east from the Sulaiman mountains to the Indus river known as the &quot;Sheikh Badin&quot; Hills.

The highest peak in the range is the limestone Sheik Badin mountain, which is protected by the Sheikh Badin National Park. Near the Indus River is a spur of limestone hills known as the &quot;Kafir Kot&quot; hills, where the ancient Hindu complex of Kafir Kot is located. DI Khan is also considered the center of Pakistan because of its location between Bhakkar, Mianwali of North Punjab, Zhob of Balochistan and South Waziristan of Pakistan&#x27;s tribal belt.

== History ==
It is named after Dodai mercenary Ismail Khan, son of Malik Sohrab Dodai of the Langah Sultanate, who laid the foundation of the area.

==Ancient history==
The Dera Ismail Khan District is littered with ruins from ancient civilizations. Dera Ismail Khan is home to the collection of Hindu ruins from two separate sites 20 miles apart, jointly known as Kafir Kot.

The region came under the influence of the Nanda empire of the ancient India from 300 BCE. With the rise of Chandragupta Maurya, the region came under the complete control of the Mauryan empire. Afterward, the region was briefly and nominally controlled by the Shunga empire. However, with the decline of the Shungas, the region passed to local Hindu and Buddhist rulers and was interrupted by foreign rulers. Many of these foreign rulers, like the Indo-Parthians, Sakas, and Kushans converted to Hinduism and Buddhism and promoted these Indian religions throughout central and south Asia. The region reached its height under the Buddhist ruler Kanishka. After the fall of the Kushans, the region came under the control of the Gupta empire of the ancient India. During this period, Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture flourished in the area.

With the decline of the imperial Guptas, the Hindu Shahis came to rule the area. The Hindu Shahis built two massive forts in the northern edges of Dera Ismail Khan. The forts were later renamed as &quot;Kafir kots&quot; (forts of the Kuffar (Disbelievers)). These Hindu Shahi forts were known for high towers and steep defensive walls. The Hindus also built many Hindu temples around the area. However, many of them are now in rubble. The Hindu Shahis remained in control of the area until their defeat by the Turkic Muslim army of Ghaznavids.

The district is part of what was historically territory inhabited by the Baloch people during the medieval India, who were invited to settle in the region by Shah Husseyn of the Langah Sultanate of Multan. These Baloch settlers were displaced by or assimilated into later waves of the Pashtun settlement.

==British era==
Dera Ismail Khan was created as an administrative unit of the British India, part of the Derajat Division of the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). It was formerly divided into almost two equal portions by the Indus river which intersected it from north to south. To the west of the Indus, the characteristics of the country resembled those of Dera Ghazi Khan. To the east of the present bed of the river, there is a wide track known as the Kachi, exposed to river action. Beyond this, the country rises abruptly, and a barren, almost desert plain stretches eastwards, sparsely cultivated, and inhabited by nomadic tribes.

In 1901, the trans-Indus tract was allotted to the newly formed North-West Frontier Province, the cis-Indus tract remaining in the Punjab jurisdiction. The cis-Indus portions of the Dera Ismail Khan and the Bannu districts now comprise the new Punjab district of Mianwali. Wheat and wool were exported. In 1901, it contained an area of and a population of 252,379. In 1947, it became part of the newly independent State of Pakistan.

In 2016, 191,000 acres in the district were brought under cultivation with completion of the Gomal Zam dam, and a series of irrigation canals partially funded by the United States Government.

<doc id="988594" wikidata="Q2379056" url="?curid=988594" title="Mardan District">
<text>Mardan District (, ) is a district in the Mardan Division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The district is named after Mardan city, which is also the headquarters of the district. The district is famous for its agriculture industry and its archaeological sites, specifically of Takht-i-Bhai, Jamal Garhi and Sawal Dher.

The main tribe of Mardan is Yusufzai, that contribute more than half of the district population, there are also the more minor settled tribes such as the Mohmand, Utmankhel, Tareen and Khalil.

==History==
The literal meaning of Mardan is the &quot;Land of Brave Men&quot;. The district lies from 34° 05&#x27; to 34° 32&#x27; north latitudes and 71&quot; 48&#x27; to 72° 25&#x27; east longitudes. It is bordered with Buner on the east, Malakand on the north, Swabi on the south east, Nowshera on the south and the Charsadda and Mohmand districts on the west and north west respectively. The total area of the district is 1632 square kilometres.

===Ancient history===
Mardan District is a part of the ancient Peshawar valley. The whole area was once part of the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, the remains of which are scattered throughout the district.

The armies of the Alexander the Great reached the Indus Valley by two separate routes. One through the Khyber Pass and the other through Kunar, Bajaur, Swat, and Buner in 326 BCE. After Alexander&#x27;s death, the valley came under the rule of Chandragupta, who ruled the valley from 297 to 321 BCE. During the reign of the Buddhist emperor Ashoka (the grandson of Chandragupta), Buddhism became the religion of the Peshawar Valley. The valley saw the revival of Hinduism after the Greeks took over in the time of King Mehanda. The Scythians and Indians followed and retained control of the valley till the 7th century CE.

===Arrival of Afghans===
By the 11th century, the Dilzak Pashtuns had appeared in the valley. At that time, the Peshawar valley was under the control of the rulers of Lahore. The Dilzak Pashtuns joined the Gakkhars who held the country between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers and compelled the Lahore rulers to cede to them the hill country, west of the Indus and south of the Kabul River.

===Ghaznavid Era===
In the 10th century the area came under the control of Sultan Sabuktigin who defeated Raja Jaipal, the Hindu ruler of Lahore. Sabuktgin&#x27;s son Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni made this area the rallying point for his numerous raids into the interior of India. In the 12th century the Ghaurid empire of the Turkic origin overthrew the Ghaznavis and the era of Ghaznavis came to an end.

===Mughal Era===
In 1505, the Mughal emperor Babur invaded the area through Khyber Pass. Baber swiftly captured the area. The people of Swat in those days were of mix origins. On one side of the river lived Pashtuns along with Gujjar, Syriake people of whom many were Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims. In the Battle of Bajaur in 1519, Baber defeated a Gibar Swati Tajik dynasty. Due to the military strength of the Yusufzai, Babur needed security from their location in the hills that threatened his empire. As part of a treaty of peace between Babur and the Yusufzai tribe to establish mutual security and ties, Babur then married Bibi Mubarika. During the Aurangzeb regime, the Pashtun tribes revolted and Aurangzeb himself led his army to re-establish his authority as struggle which lasted for two years, he finally subdued the Pashtuns. In the same war the prominent rebel leader, Darya Khan Afridi was killed and the revolt was crushed. 

===British Era===
Ranjit Singh occupied the Attock region in 1814 and Peshawar city in 1822. He left Hari Singh Nalwa in command and withdrew himself to Lahore. Peshawar city, Nowshera and Hazara were under Sikh rule for a while. Hazara was set free by Tanoli clan from Sikhs but fell to Britain in 1838. Peshawar city also fell to Pashtuns in 1834 and Nalwa died in the Battle of Jamrud. Soon the British took over. The British then went after the Sikhs and the Sikhs were defeated by the British in the Second Sikh War. Major Lawrence was appointed first Deputy Commissioner of Peshawar. From that time Peshawar city and Attock regions only (This does not include most of what is Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa today) became an administrative district under the Punjab Government. In 1909, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (the then NWFP) was constituted and in 1937, Peshawar district was bifurcated into Peshawar and Mardan districts. Britain tried its best to include FATA, Dir, Swat and other region into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa but they suffered heavy setback and finally came to an agreement in the 1920s that Britain will no longer bother the tribes and Swat region.

<text>Babbar Khalsa, officially Babbar Khalsa International (BKI, , ), is a Khalistani militant organisation that aims to create an independent nation-state of Khalistan in the Punjab region. It has used armed attacks, assassinations and bombings in aid of that goal, and is deemed to be a terrorist entity by various governments. Besides India, it operates in North America and Europe.

BKI was created in 1978 after clashes with the Nirankari sect of Sikhs. It was active throughout the 1980s in the Punjab insurgency and gained international notoriety in June 1985, for killing 329 civilians (mostly Canadians) in Air India Flight 182 in Canada&#x27;s worst case of mass murder and for the associated 1985 Narita International Airport bombinga bungled attempt at mass murder on a second Air India flight on the same day. Its influence declined in the 1990s after several of its senior leaders were killed in encounters with Indian police.

The organisation is officially banned and designated as an international terrorist organisation by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Malaysia, and India.

==Origin==
The name &quot;Babbar Khalsa&quot; is taken from the Babbar Akali Movement of 1920, which fought against the British Rule of India. The modern-day BK was created in 1978 by Talwinder Singh Parmar and Sukhdev Singh Babbar after the 1978 Sikh–Nirankari clash. On 13 April 1978, while observing the founding day of the Khalsa, the Sant Nirankari Mission clashed with the Damdami Taksal and the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, aggravated by Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh in which 15 people died. BK was formed with the support of Bibi Amarjit Kaur with Talwinder Singh as the president.

A criminal case was filed against sixty-two Nirankaris by the Akali-led government in Punjab but all the accused were acquitted. The Punjab government Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal decided not to appeal the decision. The case of Nirankaris received widespread support in the media. Soon an environment was created against the Nirankaris, perceived as the enemies of Sikhism. The chief proponents of this attitude were BK, Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal and the All India Sikh Students Federation, which was banned by the government.

== Activities ==
=== 1970s ===
# Babbar Khalsa started targeting people who sympathised with the Nirankaris. In the subsequent years following this clash, several murders took place in Punjab and the surrounding areas allegedly by Damdami Taksal and the BK. After carrying out attacks, BK members would retreat to the Golden Temple. Police did not enter the temple complex to avoid hurting the sentiments of Sikhs.

===1980s===

# According to C. Christine Fair, Babbar Khalsa was opposed to Bhindranwale and more concerned with propagating sectarian violence and enforcing Sikh personal law than supporting Khalistan movement. BK kept up a low level of activity until 1983.
# On 24 April 1980, the Nirankari head, Gurbachan Singh was murdered. Initially, associates of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and members of BK were suspected, but in 1983, a member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.
# One of Babbar Khalsa&#x27;s earliest activities was the killing of Nirankari Shaadi Lal by Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Kulwant Singh Nagoke. He was the President of Anandpur Sahib Municipality and one of the Nirankari seven stars.
# On 9 September 1981, Lala Jagat Narain was assassinated. Narain was a former Punjab Legislative Assembly member and a former Member of Parliament. He was also the found of Hind Samachar. Narain was an outspoken critic of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and of the Khalistan movement. After the assassination, Bhindranwale expressed resent against Narain, stating that Narain&#x27;s newspaper portrayed Sikh Gurus as &quot;lovers of wine and women&quot;. Babbar Khalsa claimed responsibility.
# Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale offered himself to the police for arrest on 20 September 1981, and was taken to a circuit house instead of prison. Shortly after Bhindranwale courted arrest, agitated Sikhs clashed with the police and paramilitary forces, resulting in the death of 18 protestors. On the day of his arrest, three armed men, from Babbar Khalsa, on a motorcycle opened fire using machine guns in a market in Jalandhar in retaliation, killing four people and injured twelve. The next day, in another incident at Tarn Taran one Hindu man was killed and thirteen people were injured allegedly done by Babbars. On 14 October 1981 Bhindranwale was released by the Punjab Police.
# On 16 October 1981, Sukhdev and fellow Babbar Khalsa members attacked Niranjan Singh who was a Nirankari and Indian Administrative Service officer. He was a key accused in the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash. Niranjan managed to survive the attack in an injured state, but his brother was killed.
# On October 23, 1981, Babbar&#x27;s killed the Sarpanch of Pannchata Mohinder Pal for blasphemy and &quot;beadbi&quot;.
# On 16 November 1981, 2 Babbar Khalsa members on motorcycles under Sukhdev Singh Babbar killed Parhal Chand the Nirankari head of Kapurathala district. In the killing Chand&#x27;s father was killed and his brother was injured.
# On the morning of 19 November 1981, Police Inspector Pritam Singh Bajwa and Constable Surat Singh were gunned down in Daheru village nearby Khanna in Ludhiana district while attempting to apprehend Tarsem Singh Kalasinghian and his associates hiding at the residence of Amarjit Singh Nihang, all members of BK. This act gained BK and its chief Talwinder Singh Babbar notoriety.
# In 1981 Babbar Khalsa split between members in foreign nations under Tawlinder Singh and members in India under Sukhdev Singh Babbar who was made overall head. Sukhdev said no unlawful activity will be done outside of India.
# On May 22, 1982, Babbar Khalsa members opened fire directed at Nirankari&#x27;s in Patti killing 4 and injuring many more.
# On October 27, 1982, Surinder Singh Sodhi, Babbar Khalsa members and Labh Singh killed Resham Singh. Resham was the Sant Nirankari head of Hoshiarpur District and 1 of the 7 stars. Babbars, Sodhi and Labh Singh had disguised themselves as police. They had approached Resham posing as officers who just wanted to chat. As Resham was talking about Bhindranwale, supposedly negatively, Babbars, Labh Singh and Sodhi pulled out stenguns and opened fire killing him instantly. It is said that Babbars, Sodhi and Labh Singh fled on a Royal Enfield Bullet and fired victory shots.
#On September 10, 1983, Babbar killed Kulwant Singh the Nirankari head of Faridkot.
# In 1984 Babbar Khalsa members fought side-by-side with Bhindranwale&#x27;s men during Operation Blue Star.
# In 1984 Sukhdev Singh Babbar claimed responsibility for the killing of 76 Nirankaris.
# Some terrorists acts done in Canada, India and Germany have been claimed in the name of BK. Parmar and Kalasinghian were both able to escape from India via the Nepal border and reach Canada. During his residence in Canada, Talwinder Singh continued to lead BKI activities. He was involved in terror financing, recruitment and radicalization of Sikh youths, procurement of small arms and explosives, and the development and coordination of terrorist attacks. After Operation Blue Star the organisation fell into disarray but was able to regroup and remained active.
# On 23 June 1985, Babbar Khalsa militants bombed Air India Flight 182 going from Montreal, Canada to New Delhi, India. An improvised explosive device placed inside the cargo hold of the Boeing 747 detonated and destroyed the plane at an altitude of 31,000 feet in Irish airspace and it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 329 passengers were killed, including 268 Canadian, 27 British and 24 Indian citizens.
# Parmar and Inderjit Singh Reyat were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on explosive charges, linking the two to the Air India Flight 182 bombing and 1985 Narita International Airport bombing. Parmar was acquitted of all charges. Inderjit Singh Reyat admitted to building the bomb, was convicted in the Air India bombing. Reyat a member of the ISYF, was found guilty of manslaughter for making the bombs and had to spend more than 20 years in prison at Canada, and is the only individual convicted in these attacks as of 9 February 2009. The Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 concluded that, regarding Talwinder Singh Parmar, &quot;[it] is now believed that he was the leader of the conspiracy to bomb Air India flights&quot; Five BK members from Montreal were arrested May 30, 1986, for another plot to bomb Air India flights out of New York City. Newspaper editor Tara Singh Hayer was targeted with a bomb at his office in the same year. Just weeks later, Sikhs from the Hamilton temple along with Air India bombing suspects Talwinder Singh Parmar and Ajaib Singh Bagri were arrested after being wiretapped discussing blowing up the Parliament and kidnapping children of MPs in India. Visiting Punjabi Cabinet Minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu was ambushed in Canada, surviving being shot by four gunmen. 
# In February 1986 Babbar Khalsa members killed DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Harpal Singh. He was killed along with his father. 
# On 19 January 1987 Babbar Khalsa members under Sukhdev killed Joginder Pal Pandey in Ludhiana. He was the general secretary of the Indian National Congress Party in Punjab and a member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly. In the attack Pandey&#x27;s security guard Sohan Lal was killed. Three Babbar&#x27;s in a vehicle had opened fire when Pandey&#x27;s car was stopped at a gas station. This incident led to a curfew in Ludhiana. 
# Babbar Khalsa launched an attack in September 1987 with Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala. The target was Station house officer Sub-Inspector Mith Singh. Mith Singh had been hand-picked by then chief of Punjab Police Julio F. Riberio. He was picked to deal with Budhsinghwala. Mith Singh had been accused of police brutality and targeting Budhsinghwala&#x27;s family. Mith Singh had dragged Budhsinghwala&#x27;s father by his hair in a public humiliation. Budhsinghwala began plotting to kill Mith Singh in revenge for his actions with Husan Singh and Babbar Khalsa members. The attack was carried out by Budshinghwala and fellow Sikh militants on 15 September 1987, at around 9:00 in the morning. Mith Singh was shot while he was walking along with his guard, a police constable. Both of their guns were taken by Budhsinghwala. In the crossfire a schoolboy was also killed and five others were injured. The killing is said to have greatly alarmed Punjab Chief of Police Riberio. Mith Singh was one of his best and most loyal officers.

In 2011, Central Bureau of Investigation moved against the commutation and argued in the Supreme Court of India that the case of Hawara was a &quot;rarest of rare case&quot;. In 2010, Paramjit Singh Bheora was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2010.

In May 2005, BK terrorists bombed Liberty Cinema on the G. T. Karnal Road, Delhi during the screening of the Hindi Film, Jo Bole So Nihaal (film). One person was killed and 60 were injured. Several arrests were made in connection including the operatives who carried this attack out and the suppliers of RDX for the arrack. The attack was coordinated from Stuttgart, Germany on the directions of a nephew of the leader of BK, Wadhwa Singh.

On 14 October 2007, BK militants bombed the Shingar Cinema Complex in Ludhiana, Punjab in which 6 people were killed and 37 wounded. The perpetrators were arrested. The police also recovered 2 pistols, 5.10 kg of RDX and 3 detonators from them. The militants had gone to Pakistan with a Sikh jatha for pilgrimage, where they received the training for making bombs. The group received explosive devices from Pakistan across the international border in Bikaner, Rajasthan.

===2010s===
Four Babbar Khalsa members were arrested and later bailed in July 2010 in connection with the murder of a Sikh leader in Punjab, India.

In March 2012, the execution of Balwant Singh Rajoana was stayed by the central government due to appeals by the SGPC. Later in 2013, Rajoana was additionally convicted of recovery of explosives and was sentenced for 10 years. In 2015, after a regime change at the center, Home minister Rajnath Singh ordered relooking to the case .

In a probe by Indian authorities in 2012, it was revealed that Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) provides immense financial support to BK and has provided over INR 800 million (80 crore) till that date.

On 30 September 2012, retired military general of the Indian armed forces, Lt. Gen Kuldip Singh Brar, who led the Operation Blue Star, was attacked with a knife on Oxford Street, London in an assassination attempt. BK was largely blamed for this attack. On 8 October, 2 suspects were arrested. Another man and a woman were also arrested on the charge. The 4 suspects were brought to trial and convicted for the assassination attempt on 10 December 2013. 2 of them were sentenced for 14 years and 2 were sentenced for 11 years of imprisonment.

On 5 Jan 2015, Jagtar Singh Tara, another accused in the assassination of CM Beant Singh was caught in Thailand and extradited to India.

In March 2017, Balwinder Singh, the head of BK&#x27;s operations in the United States, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by Nevada U.S. district judge for conspiracy to launch a terrorist attack in India in 2013. Singh pleaded guilty to providing funding and materials to a co-conspirator, who was to travel to India to assassinate or maim an Indian government official. The target government official was to be determined upon the co-conspirator&#x27;s arrival.

Between 2017 and 2023, many operatives, members and smugglers of BK were arrested within the territory of India and imprisoned by Indian courts as Punjab saw a new rise in Khalistani presence in the state. The leadership of BKI operated primarily from UK, Germany and Pakistan.

==Financing==
The group receives funds and support from its supporters within the Sikh community, that are largely located in Europe and North America. Historically, to get the financial and material support needed for operating terrorist activities, Babbar Khalsa has used in-person meetings, public rallies and fundraising events. Babbar organized and featured at Sikh rallies and fundraisers across Canada. Babbar was instrumental in channeling financial support to BKI from overseas Sikh communities. BKI is sponsored by Germany-based extremist organisations with an aim to revive an armed conflict in Punjab.

==Presence==
Babbar Khalsa militants have their presence outside of India in Pakistan, North America, Europe and Scandinavia. BKI at present is active in the US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Switzerland and Pakistan. BKI continues its operations from Pakistan with the support of Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). According to Indian sources the group has its headquarters in Lahore, Pakistan.

In 1992, Talwinder Singh Babbar split from the BKI and formed the BK (Babbar) faction. This happened after serious differences erupted between Babbar and BKI&#x27;s leadership. The Babbar faction has a presence in the UK, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.

<text>Mansehra District (Urdu, ) is a district in the Hazara Division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northern Pakistan. Mansehra city serves as the headquarters of the district. The district has a Hindkowan majority, with a significant Pashtun and Kohistani population.

Mansehra was established as an independent district in 1976. It was previously a tehsil within the broader Hazara District. In 1993, a former subdivision of Mansehra, Battagram, was separated as an independent district. Similarly, in 2011, another subdivision of Mansehra, Kala Dhaka, was separated which is now known as Torghar District.

==Demographics==
As of the 2023 census, Mansehra district has 294,052 households and a population of 1,797,177. The district has a sex ratio of 103.08 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 63.79%: 75.33% for males and 52.02% for females. 478,985 (26.76% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. 154,834 (8.62%) live in urban areas.

At the time of the 2023 census, 66.22% of the population spoke Hindko, 17.97% Pashto, 2.51% Kohistani and 1.16% Urdu as their first language.

Many of these, especially in the upper Kaghan Valley, are speakers of the Kohistani dialects. There are also speakers of the widely dispersed Gujari language, particularly in the Kaghan Valley. The local variety is intermediate between the eastern dialects of Gujari (spoken in Azad Kashmir) and the western group (from Chitral, Swat and Gilgit). There is also a small community in the village of Dana in Oghi Tehsil who speak the endangered Mankiyali language. Many people can write and speak English.

<doc id="988607" wikidata="Q706565" url="?curid=988607" title="Red Kelly">
<text>Leonard Patrick &quot;Red&quot; Kelly (July 9, 1927 – May 2, 2019) was a Canadian professional hockey player and coach. He was also a Liberal Member of Parliament for the Toronto-area riding of York West from 1962 to 1965, during which time he also won the Stanley Cup—twice—while actively playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Kelly played on more Stanley Cup-winning teams (eight) than any other player who never played for the Montreal Canadiens; Henri Richard (11), Jean Beliveau (10), Yvan Cournoyer (10) and Claude Provost (9) won their Cups with the Canadiens. He was also one of the only two players (the other is Terry Sawchuk) to have never played for the Canadiens and to be part of two of the nine dynasties recognized by the National Hockey League (NHL) in its history. In 2017, Kelly was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early career==
Kelly attended Doan&#x27;s Hollow Public School in Port Dover, then attended St. Michael&#x27;s College School. He grew up listening to Foster Hewitt&#x27;s broadcasts of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and was particularly inspired by the style of their hard-charging defenceman, Red Horner. However, while playing junior hockey for the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors, he was encouraged to refine his style by his coach, former Leaf great Joe Primeau.

==NHL career==
The Maple Leafs passed on Kelly after a scout predicted he would not last 20 games in the NHL (despite the Majors&#x27; long relationship with the Leafs) and the 19-year-old joined the Detroit Red Wings in 1947. In 1954 he was runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman, the first time the trophy was awarded and also won the Lady Byng Trophy in 1951, 1953 and 1954 as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. In over 12 years as a Red Wing, the team won eight regular-season championships and four Stanley Cups. He was chosen as a First Team All-Star defenceman six times.

Kelly played much of the 1958–59 season with a broken ankle. However, this was a closely guarded team secret until midway through the next season, a reporter asked Kelly why he had been off his game for much of 1959. Kelly replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t know. Might have been the ankle.&quot; When Red Wings GM Jack Adams got wind of the story, he was furious, and immediately brokered a four-player deal in which Kelly was sent to the New York Rangers. However, Kelly scuttled the deal when he announced he would retire rather than go to New York.

Maple Leafs head coach and general manager Punch Imlach stepped in and tried to talk Kelly into playing for him. Though he disliked Maple Leaf Gardens and was still smarting from the scout&#x27;s assessment of him 13 years earlier, Kelly agreed to be traded to the Leafs. Once Kelly arrived in Toronto, Imlach asked him to switch positions and become a full-time centre, figuring that Kelly could easily match up against the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Jean Béliveau. The switch proved to be a success, as, already a great playmaker, Kelly turned Frank Mahovlich into one of the most lethal goal scorers in NHL history.

Kelly won his fourth Lady Byng Award in 1961. In his eight seasons with the Leafs, they won four Stanley Cups–the same number of times he had won in Detroit. In 1,316 regular season games, he scored 281 goals and 542 assists for 823 points. At the time of his retirement, Kelly was seventh all time in career points, fifth in assists, 13th in goals, and second only to Gordie Howe in games played. In 164 playoff games, he scored 33 goals and 59 assists for 92 points.

==Coaching career==
After the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup in 1967, Kelly announced his retirement as a player, and negotiated with the expansion Los Angeles Kings to be their inaugural coach on the strength of Imlach&#x27;s assertion that Toronto would not stand in the way of Kelly&#x27;s coaching career. Imlach insisted, however, that Los Angeles draft Kelly in the expansion draft, and after the Kings failed to do so, refused to release Kelly&#x27;s rights until Los Angeles traded minor-league defenceman Ken Block to the Leafs. Kelly guided the Kings to second place in the West Division and made the playoffs two years in a row.

He left the Kings for a one-year contract to succeed Red Sullivan as coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 2, 1969. After the Penguins ended the 1969–70 season with its first-ever playoff appearance and advanced to the semifinals, Kelly signed a five-year, $250,000 contract on May 21, 1970, to continue as coach, and also replaced Jack Riley as general manager. With the team struggling in sixth place in the NHL West Division during a stretch of winning only two of 22 contests and having failed to qualify for the postseason in 1970–71, Kelly was pressured to relinquish his general manager title back to Riley on January 29, 1972, in order to concentrate on his coaching duties. Amid a slump in which the Penguins won only two games with three draws and seven losses and slid into fifth place in the eight-team NHL West Division, Kelly was fired and replaced by Ken Schinkel on January 13, 1973.

Kelly returned to the Maple Leafs after signing a four-year contract to succeed John McLellan as coach on August 20, 1973. He stayed in the position from the 1973–74 season to 1976–77. The team earned a playoff berth in all four seasons with Kelly as head coach but got eliminated in the quarterfinals each time. A bizarre aspect of his tenure as Maple Leafs coach occurred during the 1975–76 quarterfinal series when he promoted pyramid power amongst his players to counter the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; use of Kate Smith&#x27;s rendition of &quot;God Bless America.&quot; He hung a plastic model of a pyramid in the team&#x27;s clubhouse after a pair of away defeats to start the series. The players embraced the superstition after observing team captain Darryl Sittler first place his hockey sticks beneath the pyramid and then stand under it for exactly four minutes. The Maple Leafs managed to win all three of its home matches before losing the series&#x27; decisive Game 7. Kelly was fired at the end of the 1976–1977 season, ending 30 consecutive years at ice level in the NHL. Kelly coached 742 regular season games during his NHL career of which his team won 278, lost 300 and tied 134. He coached 62 NHL playoff games winning 24 of these.

==Political career==
Kelly was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 federal election in the York West electoral district, the first Liberal party member to do so since 1935. He defeated Conservative incumbent John Hamilton, 30,762 to 27,060 votes. He was easily re-elected in the following year&#x27;s election, beating his Progressive Conservative opponent, future NHL agent Alan Eagleson by an almost 13,000 vote margin. The victory meant that he was now part of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s newly elected Liberal government. Kelly continued to play with the Toronto Maple Leafs during his terms as a Member of Parliament. During the Great Canadian Flag Debate, he received opposition from Leafs owner Conn Smythe who opposed Pearson&#x27;s plans to replace the Red Ensign flag with the Maple Leaf. He did not seek re-election in 1965, but left federal politics after his two terms in the 25th and 26th Canadian Parliaments, because he wanted more time with his family. He was succeeded in York West by fellow Liberal Robert Winters.

While a member of parliament, Kelly appeared as himself on the October 29, 1962, episode of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received three of four possible votes.

<doc id="988611" wikidata="Q16039542" url="?curid=988611" title="XE-class submarine">
<text>The XE-class submarines were a series of twelve midget submarines that were built for the Royal Navy during 1944; four more to a slightly different design were built 1954-5 as the &quot;Stickleback&quot; class. They were an improved version of the used in the attack on the German battleship .

They carried a crew of four, typically a lieutenant in command, with a sub-lieutenant as deputy, an engine room artificer in charge of the mechanical side and a seaman or leading-seaman. At least one of them was qualified as a diver.

In addition to the two side charges (each of which contained two tons of amatol explosive), they carried around six limpet mines which were attached to the target by the diver.

They and their depot ship arrived at Labuan in July 1945. Four of them managed to take part in operations before the war ended.

== Operations &quot;Sabre&quot; and &quot;Foil&quot; ==
These operations, carried out in July 1945, were intended to cut the undersea telephone cables connecting Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong and Tokyo. The intention was to oblige the Japanese to use radio and render themselves open to message interception.

Operation Sabre was directed at the Hong Kong to Saigon telephone cable, and carried out by &quot;XE4&quot;, which was towed to within of the Mekong Delta by the submarine HMS &quot;Spearhead&quot;, where she looked for the two telephone cables by using a towed grapnel. She eventually snagged the first cable, and managed to haul it about off the seabed. &quot;XE4&#x27;s&quot; diver, Sub-Lieutenant K.M. Briggs, used the net/cable cutter to sever it. The second cable was soon found as well, and was severed by the second diver, Sub-Lieutenant A. Bergius. Two divers were carried due to the operating rule that a diver should not spend more than 20 minutes in depths over and no more than 10 minutes over . &quot;XE4&quot; and &quot;Spearhead&quot; returned to Labuan on 3 August 1945.

Operation Foil was directed at the Hong Kong to Singapore telephone cable and carried out by &quot;XE5&quot; against the Hong Kong end of the cable, after being towed into position by the submarine HMS &quot;Selene&quot;. Operating close inshore near to Lamma Island, working conditions were poor, &quot;XE5&#x27;s&quot; divers having to work in thick mud under the constant threat of oxygen poisoning. Despite repeated attempts it was not completely certain that the cable had in fact been severed, and it was not until after the Japanese surrender that it was confirmed that &quot;XE5&quot; had succeeded in doing so. &quot;XE5&quot; and &quot;Selene&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 6 August 1945.

==Operation Struggle==
In August 1945, HMS &quot;XE1&quot; and &quot;XE3&quot; executed a joint attack on Japanese warships within Singapore harbour. &quot;XE3&quot; was tasked with mining the heavy cruiser &quot;Takao&quot; while &quot;XE1&quot; was to attack the heavy cruiser &quot;Myōkō&quot;.

The approach of &quot;XE3&quot; along the Straits of Johor and through the various harbour defences took 11 hours plus a further two hours to locate the camouflaged target. Despite several opportunities for Japanese defenders to spot the vessel, &quot;XE3&quot; successfully reached the &quot;Takao&quot;, fixed limpet mines and dropped its two, 2-ton side charges. The withdrawal was successfully made and &quot;XE3&quot; returned to HMS &quot;Stygian&quot;, her towing submarine. Meanwhile, &quot;XE1&quot; was delayed by Japanese patrol craft, and her captain, realizing that he could not reach &quot;Myōkō&quot; (which was two miles further into the harbour than &quot;Takao&quot;) before the mines already laid by &quot;XE3&quot; would explode, also elected to drop his own charges under &quot;Takao&quot;. &quot;XE1&quot; also successfully returned to her towing submarine, HMS &quot;Spark&quot;.

The &quot;Takao&quot;, already damaged and not seaworthy, was severely damaged and never sailed again. &quot;XE3&quot;s commander, Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser RNR, and diver Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis were awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for their part in the attack; whilst Sub-Lieutenant William James Lanyon Smith, RNZNVR, who was at the controls of &quot;XE3&quot;, received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO); Engine Room Artificer Third Class Charles Alfred Reed, who was at the wheel, received the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM). &quot;XE1&quot;&#x27;s C/O, Lieutenant John Elliott Smart RNVR received the DSO, and Sub-Lieutenant Harold Edwin Harper, RNVR received the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC); and ERA Fourth Class Henry James Fishleigh and Leading Seaman Walter Henry Arthur Pomeroy received the Distinguished Service Medal. ERA Fourth Class Albert Nairn, Acting Leading Stoker Jack Gordan Robinson, and Able Seaman Ernest Raymond Dee were Mentioned in Despatches for their part in bringing the two midget submarines from harbour to the point where the crews that took part in the attack took over.

==Post war==

In 1950 XE7 was loaned, along with its crew, to the US for testing.

<text>The term Lederhosen (; , singular in German usage: &quot;Lederhose&quot;, ; lit. &quot;Leather Pants&quot;) is used in English to refer specifically to the traditional leather breeches worn by men in Southern Germany (specifically in Bavaria and Swabia), Austria, South Tyrol and Slovenia. The term &quot;Trachten Lederhose&quot; is often used in German to avoid confusion with other types of leather pants. The longer trousers are generally called &quot;Bundhosen&quot;.

==History==

Lederhosen probably originated during the late Middle Ages. They were worn for hard physical work, as they were more durable than fabric garments. Today, they are mostly worn as leisurewear. Lederhosen and dirndl attire are also common at Oktoberfest events around the world.

&quot;La Couturière Parisienne&quot; stated that lederhosen were originally not exclusively Bavarian garments, but were worn all over Europe, especially by riders, hunters, and other people involved in outdoor activities. The flap (drop front), though, may have been a unique Bavarian invention. The drop-front style became so popular in the 18th century that it was known in France as &quot;à la bavaroise,&quot; &quot;in the Bavarian style&quot;.

While there are Lederhosen that go past the knee, these were mostly worn for special occasions; the everyday form of Lederhosen in the Austrian and Bavarian Alps were cut above the knee. Workers and hunters alike preferred the added mobility, especially in the steep slopes of the Eastern Alps. While the exact origin of this cut is uncertain, the first written account of its use was made by August Lewald during his tour of Tuxertal, Tyrol, Austria in 1835.

While the popularity of lederhosen remained constant in the depths of the Eastern Alps, their everyday use steadily declined along the outer edges of the mountain range. Nowhere was this more bemoaned than in the Upper Bavarian town of Bayrischzell, where school teacher Joseph Vogl set out to preserve this Alpine tradition. In 1883, he established the Association for the Preservation of the National Costume in the Leitzach Valley and in Bayrischzell. This association became the model for other preservation clubs known as &quot;Trachtenvereine&quot;, which spread across the outer edges of the Eastern Alps; from Munich to Salzburg and to Vienna. In Bavaria, the efforts to preserve traditional clothing and bolster a Bavarian identity were greatly supported by the ruling class. King Ludwig II famously supported the creation of &quot;Trachtenvereine&quot;, and King Ludwig III wore lederhosen on trips to the Alps to show support for their preservation.

Lederhosen are also part of the traditional costume of Swabia and its former portion of the Black Forest in present-day Baden-Württemberg, but the lederhosen in these areas were always worn below the knee and never in the short style common in Bavaria. These knee-length &quot;Bundhosen&quot; are cuffed at the bottom, also unlike their Bavarian counterparts. While plaid shirts were worn with Swabian lederhosen at times, they are historically more commonly worn with a white linen shirt and colorful vest, most commonly red. Also unique to the region is the color of the lederhosen. In contrast to brown, most Swabians, including farmers, wore black, while the region&#x27;s winemakers wore yellow. These lederhosen also have a decorative motif that is unique to the region. Today, lederhosen and so-called traditional costumes are worn mainly for local festivals and partially designed according to modern fashion trends.

==Variations==

* Decorative Seams: There are 3, 5, 7, and even 9-seam lederhosen, depending on the number of stitched designs along the side trouser seam and at the front of the bib.
* Cuff: The side seams of lederhosen are either tied or buttoned together at the cuff
* Inseam: The lederhosen are held together by either a vertical seam or a horizontal seam known as a &quot;Tellernaht&quot;

* Color: Traditionally, the lederhose would either be black or brown

In July 1988, the former Charsadda tehsil was separated and attained the status of a separate district. In 1990, the Nowshera tehsil also was upgraded to the status of a district.

<text>Ballymote () is a market town in southern County Sligo, Ireland. It is around 20 km south of Sligo town in the province of Connacht, which is in the north-west of Ireland. Ballymote lies in the barony of Corran. It is a commuter town with a strong history of independent enterprises along with firm local health, school, and transport services. Ballymote is on the main Dublin to Sligo Train Line, and 10 minutes from the N4 / N17 roads. The town serves a large hinterland area in south east County Sligo.

The Norman Ballymote Castle dates from the 1300s, and the Book of Ballymote was written in or near the town in the 1390s.

==History==

The origins of the settlement appear to have been derived from the 12th century Norman Castle, though evidence of earlier settlement and farming in area from 1000BC exists through the presence of ringforts, cairns, and archaeological remains.

Ballymote was much affected by the disruption of the full conquest of Ireland by the English and Protestant settlers in the early modern period (1536–1691). Ballymote was ravaged several times in the 16th century and finally burned to waste. In 1608 King James I granted an estate encompassing the castle and area around the town to James Fullerton, this was soon to pass to the Taaffes. Following litigations, court action and a forced sale John Fitzmaurice (Lord Shelburne) bought the Ballymote estate in 1753.

On coming to Ballymote, Shelburne found the land mostly uncultivated with the inhabitants, all Roman Catholic, making no attempt to manufacture goods but subsisting on herding cattle. Shelburne made a start to establish Ballymote as a centre for the linen industry in County Sligo, by provisioning cottages for Protestant weavers and spinners brought in from Ulster. Expansion was slow, and with Shelburne&#x27;s death in 1761 his widow attempted to progress his project through managers, expanding from 20 to 60 looms. In 1774 the younger son, Thomas Fitzmaurice, after studying the linen business, began the modern expansion of the town, with the construction of a bleach mill, workers houses, and Earlsfield House, a residence for himself. In 1776 it was noted that Fitzmaurice had invited architect James Paine to plan a redevelopment of the town with a new street layout, a market house and other associated houses. No records exist of Paine&#x27;s plans, and it is not clear if his designs were implemented. By 1799, it was recorded that most of the inhabitants of Ballymote were weavers. Linen production peaked in the period from 1815 to 1820, but went into steep decline by the 1840s. Within the history of planned industrial settlements centred around the linen industry in Ireland, this was one of the later attempts with the manufacturing of linen in the town ultimately abandoned.

In 1833, the ownership of the town was transferred from the Fitzmaurices to the Gore-Booth family of Lissadell, who has established a corn mill in the town in 1795. In 1837, the town consisted of 140 houses on a single main street at the junction of six roads, and was owned by Robert Gore-Booth. A map from 1847 shows the core layout of the current town established.

<text>Xmal Deutschland (pronounced: ), often written as X-Mal Deutschland, was a German gothic rock band. Founded in 1980 with a completely female line-up, they had chart success both in and outside their native country. Their last album was released in 1989.

==Biography==
Xmal Deutschland was formed in 1980 by Anja Huwe (vocals), Manuela Rickers (guitar), Fiona Sangster (keyboards), Rita Simonsen (bass) and Caro May (drums) in Hamburg. Their first single, &quot;Schwarze Welt&quot;, was released a year later on Alfred Hilsberg’s ZickZack label. The band also contributed to the label compilation &quot;Lieber Zuviel Als Zuwenig&quot; (ZZ 45). Around this time, Rita Simonsen was replaced by Wolfgang Ellerbrock.

In 1982, the band released the goth classic &quot;Incubus Succubus&quot;. Caro May left the band and formed a new band, and was replaced by Manuela Zwingmann the same year. While German audiences were less than receptive at first, a United Kingdom tour opening for Cocteau Twins resulted in a deal with independent label 4AD. Their debut album, &quot;Fetisch&quot; and the singles &quot;Qual&quot; and &quot;Incubus Succubus II&quot; were released in 1983, all three making the UK Indie Charts, even though the band wrote and performed in German.

Manuela Zwingmann left the band after one year, being replaced by Peter Bellendir. This lineup, Huwe/Rickers/Sangster/Ellerbrock/Bellendir was the longest lasting. The single &quot;Reigen&quot; and the album &quot;Tocsin&quot; were released in 1984, followed by a world tour in 1985. &quot;Tocsin&quot; reached number 86 on the UK Albums Chart.

The &quot;Sequenz&quot; EP was essentially a remake of a John Peel session, which had been originally recorded on 30 April 1985 and broadcast on 13 May 1985. The EP contained the tracks &quot;Jahr Um Jahr II&quot;, &quot;Autumn&quot; (the band&#x27;s first song with English lyrics, apart from brief snatches of English that appeared in &quot;Qual&quot;, &quot;Young Man&quot; and &quot;Tag für Tag&quot;) and &quot;Polarlicht&quot; but omitted &quot;Der Wind&quot;, which was played at the Peel sessions.

&quot;Matador&quot;, produced by Hugh Cornwell of The Stranglers, was released in 1986. Xmal Deutschland also opened for The Stranglers at a concert in Wembley Arena, London, as well as supporting them on their entire UK tour. 

Their follow-up album, &quot;Viva&quot; was recorded in Hamburg and was released in 1987 through Phonogram, followed by the single &quot;Sickle Moon&quot;. &quot;Viva&quot; contains a large number of English lyrics, including a poem by Emily Dickinson.

After the release of &quot;Viva&quot;, Manuela Rickers, Fiona Sangster and Peter Bellendir left the group. Anja Huwe and Wolfgang Ellerbrock continued to work with Frank Z (of Abwärts) on guitar. Producer Henry Staroste played keyboards and studio drummer Curt Cress completed the line-up that recorded the 1989 LP &quot;Devils&quot;, and the singles &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Near You&quot;. This also proved to be the last release of Xmal Deutschland, showing a change of direction towards mainstream pop.

The group made a few live appearances in 1990 before disbanding later that same year.

==Afterwards==
Drummer Peter Bellendir died on 3 February 2013 of complications following an organ transplant.

==Media appearances==
&quot;Incubus Succubus&quot; featured in &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; season 2 episode 9, where the subtitles described it as &quot;upbeat music&quot;.

<text>Bristol Bay (, ) is the easternmost arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik.

Upper reaches of Bristol Bay experience some of the highest tides in the world. One such reach, the Nushagak Bay near Dillingham and another near Naknek in Kvichak Bay have tidal extremes in excess of 10 m (30 ft), ranking them — and the area — as eighth highest in the world. Coupled with the extreme number of shoals, sandbars, and shallows, it makes navigation troublesome, especially during the area&#x27;s frequently strong winds. As the shallowest part of the Bering Sea, Bristol Bay is one of the most dangerous regions for large vessels.
== History ==

In ancient times, much of Bristol Bay was dry and arable, along with much of the Bering Sea Land Bridge. More recently, its proximity to mineral, animal and seafood riches provided an incentive for human habitation along its shoreline. Early Russian and English exploration provided most of the non-native influences of the area. During his voyage through the area in 1778, the famed British navigator and explorer Captain James Cook named the area &quot;in honor of the Admiral Earl of Bristol&quot; in England.

=== Early settlement ===

After establishing some temporary settlements in the late 1790s, The Russian American Company sent exploratory parties to document the coast and nearby inland areas of Bristol Bay. One of these charted the area between the Kuskokwim and Nushagak Rivers. The original Eskimo village at Naknek went through various names as recorded by the Russians after they arrived in the area in 1819 (1821-“Naugeik”; 1880- “Kinuyak”; and finally Naknek as named by Russian Navy Captain Tebenkov). Later, in 1819, an Aleut by the name of Andrei Ustiugov drew the first intensive charts of Bristol Bay. Additionally, ships of the Russian Navy conducted extensive surveys of the Bering Sea coastline into the mid-19th century, naming many of the geographical features commonly used today: Capes Constantine, Chichagof, Menshikof and Greig, Mounts Veniaminof and Pavlof, Becharof Lake, etc. In 1883 the first salmon cannery was open in Bristol Bay” (Source information from the cannery article to give context on the expansion of the salmon industry in Alaska and the history of growth.

The influence of the Katmai Volcano Explosion in 1912 and the influenza epidemic in 1919 decimated the Naknek people and area. According to oral history, there were only about three original families left at that time.

=== World War Two ===
On July 7 1937, Alaskans witnessed conflict as Japanese fishing vessels entered the waters of Bristol Bay with 10,000-ton fishing trawlers to harvest salmon.

At that time, the Fisheries Bureau prohibited the use of motorized vessels, fish traps, and purse seines in Alaska. This was to ensure a 50% escapement of the spawning salmon, to guarantee their sustainability.

The Japanese fleet was composed of diesel-powered steel vessels. The Japanese had a technological advantage over the American fisherman and dominated the bay that summer.

In 1938, the United States agreed with Japan that the Japanese would refrain from fishing in Alaskan waters. This agreement was honored until Japan and the United States entered World War 2. In the 1950s, Japan was strengthening its fishing presence in the Pacific; the US, Canada, and Japan passed the North Pacific Fisheries Treaty. This treaty managed the resources of the region jointly to preserve the future generations of fish. This agreement is the model for international fisheries regulations today.

== Industry ==

Bristol Bay is home to the world&#x27;s most abundant Sockeye (red) salmon fishery as well as strong runs of Chum (dog) salmon, Coho (silver) salmon, Chinook (king) salmon, and Pink (humpy) salmon, each occurring seasonally. Chinook return to their freshwater spawning grounds earliest in the summer, followed by Sockeye and Chum. Coho and Pink salmon swim to their spawning grounds last, later in the summer. Fishing activity peaks for specific species during times of the highest concentration of salmon moving from the saltwater Pacific Ocean to the brackish Bristol Bay, then finally to their freshwater natal spawning streams at the headwaters of the many lakes and rivers in the Bristol Bay watershed.

On an international scale, Sockeye salmon are a relatively rare creature. Like other wild salmon species, Sockeye harvests fluctuate but comprise 4 to 7 percent of global salmon production and 13 to 20 percent of wild salmon harvests. Between 2011 and 2014, Sockeye salmon accounted for 5 percent of the world&#x27;s salmon harvest by volume and 15 percent of the world&#x27;s wild salmon harvest.

===Commercial fishing===
Bristol Bay is home to the world&#x27;s largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay&#x27;s freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world&#x27;s largest Sockeye salmon fishery. The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon fishing accounts for nearly 75% of local jobs.

During the first 50 years of commercial salmon fishing in Bristol Bay, the fishing boats were restricted to sail power. When this restriction lifted in 1951, it took only seven short years to outfit all the boats (approximately 1,500) with diesel or gas engines. In the late 1920s another law was passed restricting the length of the boats to 32 feet. This law holds true even today.

=== Canneries ===
Bristol Bay is a remote part of Alaska. The canneries preserve the freshness of the salmon which are gutted, cleaned, and processed on site. These companies have established a presence in Bristol Bay.

Canneries include North Pacific Seafoods, Togiak Seafoods, Bristol Bay Setnet, Friedman Family Fisheries, Peter Pan Seafoods, Ekuk Fisheries, Big Creek Shore plant, Coffee Point Seafood, Icicle Seafoods, Wild Premium Salmon, Seafood Enterprises of Alaska, Alaska General Seafoods, Alaska Salmon Wild, Da Kine Enterprise, Extreme Salmon, Great Ruby Fish, My Girl, Naknek Family Fisheries, North Pacific Seafoods, Ocean Beauty, Silver Bay Seafoods, Trident Seafoods, Tulchina Fisheries, Diamond Lodge Smokehouse, and Nakeen Homepack.
Major industries are commercial fishing and the associated canneries, sport fishing, hunting and tourism. The number of business lodges, hunting- and fishing-resorts and visitors to the nearby Katmai National Park and Preserve has grown exponentially in recent years. Sports fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen targeting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).[18]

The area has also experienced significant interest in oil and mineral development, most notably with the proposed Pebble Mine on the north shore of Iliamna Lake, and auctioning of leases to tracts in the southern Bristol Bay area known as the North Aleutians Basin, an area which has been closed to offshore oil and gas development since a moratorium in 1998. The draft plan by the Bureau of Land Management (pending public comments until 2/5/2007), also proposes to open most of the BLM&#x27;s in the area to hard rock mining and oil and gas drilling.

== Demographics ==

The largest community in the Bristol Bay area is Dillingham. Many other communities dot the coastline and rivers of Bristol Bay, including:

* Aleknagik
* Chignik
* Chignik Lagoon
* Chignik Lake
* Clark&#x27;s Point
* Egegik 
* Ekuk 
* Ekwok
* Igiugig 
* Iliamna
* Ivanof Bay
* King Salmon
* Kokhanok
* Koliganek
* Levelock
* Manokotak 
* Naknek
* New Stuyahok 
* Newhalen
* Nondalton
* Pedro Bay
* Perryville
* Pilot Point
* Pope-Vannoy Landing
* Port Alsworth
* Port Heiden
* Portage Creek
* South Naknek
* Togiak
* Twin Hills
* Ugashik (

All of these communities are primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives, except for Dillingham and King Salmon; the former being influenced early-on by salmon-cannery employees from around the world including European and Asian people. King Salmon was populated by military personnel stationed, primarily during Cold War years, at the King Salmon Air Force Station, and later by visitors and employees of the nearby Katmai National Park and Preserve.

== Proposed Pebble Mine ==

A mineral exploration project investigating a large porphyry copper, gold, and molybdenum deposit in the Bristol Bay region has been proposed and may be undertaken by British-Australian Rio Tinto Group and Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC staked a claim on the site in 2001 and with its partners, invested 500 million dollars into the project. The mining company lost all of its partners in 2011 due to increasing government regulations and distrust by its partners.

Because of the estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste that must be permanently stored in the area, which is an active earthquake zone, and Rio Tinto&#x27;s environmental track record, which is seen as poor by many environmental advocacy groups, fears have been raised about the potential impact on the Bristol Bay area and its wildlife and residents. In April 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an assessment of the impact of the proposed mining operations on fisheries, wildlife, and native Alaska tribes. Between 2014 and May 2017, Pebble sued the EPA several times. The company argued the EPA unfairly assumed the scope of the mine before it formally filed mining plans. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC. accused the government agency of colluding with anti-mine activists to reach its conclusions.

In July 2019, the EPA withdrew their preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site. In September 2020, while posing as potential investors in the mine an environmental activist group secretly taped conversations with Ronald Thiessen, chief executive of Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Tom Collier, chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership. During the conversations Collier and Thiessen detailed their plans to gain the favor of elected politicians from Juneau to Washington, D.C. to gain a favorable outcome for the approval of the mining operation. The conversations also revealed that while the company is seeking a 20 year permit, Thiessen outlined how it could last another 160 years. 

After more than two decades of opposition by a majority of Bristol Bay residents and Tribes, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used its authority under the Clean Water Act 404(c) to stop the proposed Pebble Mine project. The EPA released a Final Determination which declared that after extensive scientific and technical research and robust stakeholder engagement that the Pebble Mine would have unacceptable adverse affects to salmon fishery areas in the Bristol Bay watershed.

* Martung ()()
* Puran ()()

== History ==
Shangla was a sub-division of the Swat district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan until it was granted the status of a separate district in 1995. This was primarily due to the efforts of Haji Badi uz Zaman, a political leader and community figure who was assassinated in 1994, and his son, Afsar ul Mulk. 

There are relics of the ancient Greek period at Pirsar, Chakesar and Daut. It is believed that Alexander the Great camped at Pirsar for a few days. There are also relics of the Hindu Shahi in Olandar-Ajmair. 

A number of Buddha sculptures are also found in Shangla district which indicate that Shangla was also a part of the previous Buddhist civilization.

The district was hit by the 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake in which more than 18 people were killed.

== Geography ==

Shangla district consists of small valleys and is situated between the hillocks and is surrounded by high mountains full of forests comprising Pindrow Fir, Morinda Spruce, Blue Pine (Kail), Chir Pine and Deodar Cedar trees. The average elevation of the district is 2000 to 3000 meters above sea level. The highest point (3,440 m) is near Kuz Ganrshal in the north of the district. Shangla District is connected to the Swat District by the Shangla Pass.

== Demographics ==

As of the 2023 census, Shangla district has 125,540 households and a population of 891,252. The district has a sex ratio of 106.65 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 33.74%: 48.82% for males and 17.82% for females. 307,444 (34.51% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. The entire population lives in rural areas. 2,410 (0.27%) people in the district are from religious minorities, mainly Christians.

Pashto was the predominant language, spoken by 95.40% of the population. 1.03% of the population spoke Kohistani languages.

The main tribe of Shangla is Yusufzai, that contribute more than half of the district population, the dense and well populated area of Shangla is Alpuri tehsil (Gwarband) that contributes to more than 253000+ of the district population. Shangla is one of the unique districts of Pakistan that contains more than 80% of forest land. The youngest noble laurate Malala Yousafzai&#x27;s father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was born in Shangla, however, she herself was born in Mingora, Swat.

== Education ==
In November 2022, the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mahmood Khan, inaugurated University of Shangla. The university was earlier a campus of University of Swat. 

== National and provincial assembly ==
This district is represented by one elected MNA (Member of National Assembly) in Pakistan National Assembly. Its constituency is NA-31.

<doc id="988628" wikidata="Q4669447" url="?curid=988628" title="Abraxas (computer virus)">
<text>Abraxas, also known as Abraxas5, discovered in April 1993, is an encrypted, overwriting, file infecting computer virus which infects .COM and .EXE files, although it does not infect . It does not become memory resident. Each time an infected file is executed, Abraxas infects the copy of located in the C:\DOS directory (creating the file if it does not exist), as well as one EXE file in the current directory. Due to a bug in the virus, only the first EXE file in any directory is infected.

Abraxas-infected files will become 1,171 bytes in length and contain Abraxas&#x27; viral code. The file&#x27;s date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will be set to the system date and time when infection occurred. The following text strings can be found within the viral code in all Abraxas infected programs:

&quot;*.exe c:\dos\dosshell.com .. MS-DOS (c)1992&quot;

&quot;-»ABRAXAS-5«--&quot;

&quot;...For he is not of this day&quot;

&quot;...Nor he of this mind&quot;

Execution of infected programs will also result in the display of a graphic &quot;ABRAXAS&quot; on the system display, accompanied by an ascending scale being played on the system speaker.

Abraxas was created with the PS-MPC virus creation tool, which can be used to create similar, easily detected viruses, which are usually encrypted as well.

More than 20 viruses have appeared which have clearly been produced with the PS-MPC: 
* 203 (computer virus) 
* 644 (computer virus) 
* Abraxas (computer virus) 
* ARCV-n (computer virus) Remark: ARCV group has also produced viruses with the TPE and developed the ARCV strain. 
* Joshua (computer virus)
* Kersplat (computer virus)
* McWhale (computer virus)
* Mimic (computer virus)
* Small ARCV (computer virus)
* Small EXE (computer virus)
* Swan Song (computer virus)

The name &quot;Abraxas&quot; was also used for a virus in the video game .

<text>Apheresis ( (&quot;aphairesis&quot;, &quot;a taking away&quot;)) is a medical technology in which the blood of a person is passed through an apparatus that separates out one particular constituent and returns the remainder to the circulation. It is thus an extracorporeal therapy.

One of the uses of apheresis is for collecting hematopoetic stem cells.
== Method ==

Depending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by density is required, centrifugation is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.

The centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:

=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===

Continuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two venipunctures as &quot;continuous&quot; means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture by pooling blood in a vessel and cycling through drawing and returning blood though the needle while the centrifuge continuously processes blood remaining in the vessel. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor&#x27;s hematocrit, and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.

=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===

Intermittent flow centrifugation (IFC) works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a bolus. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. It does require a larger extracorporeal volume, and takes significantly longer to perform the procedure via IFC. As such, it is less likely to be used for therapeutic reasons, and is often seen in Donation Center settings. To stop the blood from coagulating, anticoagulant is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.

=== Centrifugation variables ===

The centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is &quot;sit time&quot; in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The result in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the RBCs at the bottom, the buffy coat of platelets and WBCs (lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes) in the middle and the plasma on top.

== Types ==

There are numerous types of apheresis.

=== Donation ===

Blood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during blood donation, where the needed component is collected and the unharvested components are returned to the donor. Fluid replacement is usually not needed in this type of collection. In many countries, apheresis donors can donate platelets more often than those donating whole blood. There are several categories of component collections:
* Plasmapheresis – blood plasma. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group. Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.

* Erythrocytapheresis – red blood cells. Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of erythrocytes from whole blood. It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation. The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as &#x27;Double Reds&#x27; or &#x27;Double Red Cell Apheresis.&#x27;
* Plateletpheresis (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) – blood platelets. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 × 1011 in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.
* Leukapheresis – leukocytes (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of PMNs, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed. There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte transfusion. The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24 °C). Since the &quot;buffy coat&quot; layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection. Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 × 1010 granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes). Irradiation does not affect PMN function. Since there is usually a small amount of RBCs collected, ABO compatibility should be employed when feasible.
* Stem cell harvesting – hematopoietic stem cells. Circulating peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are harvested to use in peripheral stem cell transplantation following administration of a mobilizing agent, such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).
* Lymphapheresis – lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are harvested to use in manufacture of CAR T cell products for T-cell-based immunotherapies.

==== Donor safety ====
* Single use kits – Apheresis is done using single-use kits, so there is no risk of infection from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge. Blood does not contact the device and during the separation, blood does not exit the kit.
* Reinfusion – At the end of the procedure, the remaining blood in the kit is given back to the donor with a process called &#x27;reinfusion&#x27;.
* Immune system effects – &quot;the immediate decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and serum immunoglobulin concentrations are of slight to moderate degree and are without known adverse effects. Less information is available regarding long-term alterations of the immune system&quot;.

===== Kit problems =====

Two apheresis kit recalls were:
* Baxter Healthcare Corporation (2005), in which &quot;pinhole leaks were observed at the two-omega end of the umbilicus (multilumen tubing), causing a blood leak.&quot;
* Fenwal Incorporated (2007), in which there were &quot;two instances where the anticoagulant citrate dextrose (ACD) and saline lines were reversed in the assembly process. The reversed line connections may not be visually apparent in the monitor box, and could result in excessive ACD infusion and severe injury, including death, to the donor.&quot;
===== Donor selection =====

People who do not use a drug that may prevent blood donation, who do not have the risk of the carrier of a disease, and who have suitable vascular structure may be apheresis donors. For apheresis platelet donation the donor&#x27;s pre platelet count should be above 150 x 10^9/L. For apheresis plasma donation, the donor&#x27;s total protein level should be greater than 60 g/L. For double red cell apheresis, donors of either gender require a minimum hemoglobin level of 14.0 g/dl.

===== Plasticizer exposure =====

Apheresis uses plastics and tubing, which come into contact with the blood. The plastics are made of PVC in addition to additives such as a plasticizer, often DEHP. DEHP leaches from the plastic into the blood, and people have begun to study the possible effects of this leached DEHP on donors as well as transfusion recipients.
* &quot;current risk or preventive limit values for DEHP such as the RfD of the US EPA (20 μg/kg/day) and the TDI of the European Union (20–48 μg/kg/day) can be exceeded on the day of the plateletpheresis. ... Especially women in their reproductive age need to be protected from DEHP exposures exceeding the above mentioned preventive limit values.&quot;
* &quot;Commercial plateletpheresis disposables release considerable amounts of DEHP during the apheresis procedure, but the total dose of DEHP retained by the donor is within the normal range of DEHP exposure of the general population.&quot;
* The Baxter company manufactured blood bags without DEHP, but there was little demand for the product in the marketplace

* &quot;Mean DEHP doses for both plateletpheresis techniques (18.1 and 32.3 μg/kg/day) were close to or exceeded the reference dose (RfD) of the US EPA and tolerable daily intake (TDI) value of the EU on the day of the apheresis. Therefore, margins of safety might be insufficient to protect especially young men and women in their reproductive age from effects on reproductivity. At present, discontinuous-flow devices should be preferred to avert conceivable health risks from plateletpheresis donors. Strategies to avoid DEHP exposure of donors during apheresis need to be developed.&quot;

=== Therapy ===


The various apheresis techniques may be used whenever the removed constituent is causing severe symptoms of disease. Generally, apheresis has to be performed fairly often, and is an invasive process. It is therefore only employed if other means to control a particular disease have failed, or the symptoms are of such a nature that waiting for medication to become effective would cause suffering or risk of complications. For autoimmune diseases in which apheresis is effective, it is used not as a standalone treatment, but rather in conjunction with therapies that reduce production of autoantibodies.
* Plasma exchange – removal of the liquid portion of blood to remove harmful substances. The plasma is replaced with a replacement solution.
* LDL apheresis – removal of low density lipoprotein in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
* Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a) apheresis
* Photopheresis – used to treat graft-versus-host disease, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and rejection in heart transplantation.
* Immunoadsorbtion with Staphylococcal protein A-agarose column – removal of allo- and autoantibodies (in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, hemophilia) by directing plasma through protein A-agarose columns. Protein A is a cell wall component produced by several strains of Staphylococcus aureus which binds to the Fc region of IgG.
* Leukocytapheresis – removal of malignant white blood cells in people with leukemia and very high white blood cell counts causing symptoms.
* Erythrocytapheresis – removal of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in people with iron overload as a result of Hereditary haemochromatosis. This process is also used for exchange transfusion in severe malaria, or in sickle cell patients with specific indications such as acute chest syndrome or stroke. 
* Thrombocytapheresis – removal of platelets in people with symptoms from extreme elevations in platelet count such as those with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.

==Indications==
===ASFA categories===

In 2023, the American Society for Apheresis published the 9th Special Edition of evidence based guidelines for the practice of Apheresis Medicine. These guidelines are based upon a systematic review of available scientific literature. Clinical utility for a given disease is denoted by assignment of an ASFA Category (I – IV). The quality and strength of evidence are denoted by standard GRADE recommendations. ASFA Categories are defined as follows:
* Category I for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is accepted as a first line treatment,
* Category II for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is accepted as a second-line treatment,
* Category III for disorders where the optimal role of therapeutic apheresis is not clearly established and
* Category IV for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is considered ineffective or harmful.
===Diseases and disorders===
Only diseases (or mentioned special conditions thereof) with ASFA category I or II are displayed in bold, with category I being underlined in addition.

== Fluid replacement during apheresis ==

When an apheresis system is used for therapy, the system is removing relatively small amounts of fluid (not more than 10.5 mL/kg body weight). That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a crystalloid like normal saline (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up oncotic pressure. Some institutions use human serum albumin, but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Routine use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not generally appropriate because of the dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), ABO incompatibility, infection, and allergic reactions. However, FFP should be used in cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or patients at high risk of bleeding.

<doc id="988663" wikidata="Q3090790" url="?curid=988663" title="Thymectomy">
<text>A thymectomy is an operation to remove the thymus. It usually results in remission of myasthenia gravis with the help of medication including steroids. However, this remission may not be permanent. Thymectomy is indicated when thymoma are present in the thymus. Anecdotal evidence suggests MG patients with no evidence of thymoma may still benefit from thymectomy.

==Surgical approaches==
There are a number of surgical approaches to the removal of the thymus gland: transternal (through the breast bone), transcervical (through a small neck incision), and transthoracic (through one or both sides of the chest).
* The transternal approach is most common and uses the same length-wise incision through the sternum (breast bone) used for most open-heart surgery. It is espoused by surgeons such as Alfred Jaretzki and is the most commonly performed procedure due to its relative simplicity.
* The transcervical approach is a less invasive procedure that allows for removal of the entire thymus gland through a small neck incision. 

There has been no difference in success in symptom improvement between the transsternal approach and the minimally invasive transcervical approach.

Video-assisted approaches, such as thoracoscopic surgery, are increasingly prescribed since the less invasive nature of the procedure strikes a balance with the lack of actual clinical evidence supporting thymectomy in non-thymomal cases.

==Impact of thymic loss==
Thymectomy is a treatment for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease. For about 60% of people with myasthenia gravis, thymectomy significantly improves their symptoms of muscle weakness. In about 30% of cases, thymectomy results in permanent remission of myasthenia gravis, negating the need for any additional medication. Improvements in condition as a result of thymectomy are often delayed, typically occurring one or two years after the surgical procedure, though could be as late as five years. In some people, thymectomy does not alleviate any symptoms of myasthenia gravis.

Experiments involving thymectomy in newborn mice showed that it unexpectedly resulted in wasting disease when performed before the mouse was three days old. This is because the thymus is the site where T cells are generated. Removal of the thymus resulted in autoimmunity, in which the immune cells attack the organism&#x27;s own healthy cells and tissues.

Those who have had their thymus removed should not receive the Yellow Fever vaccine.

<text>Hygd, introduced in line 1925 of the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, is married to of King Hygelac of Geatland. She is the daughter of Hæreth.

After Beowulf defeats Grendel and Grendel&#x27;s mother, he and his men returned to their native country, where they are received by Hygelac and Hygd. Hygd is beautiful, wise, courteous, and attentive. She pours mead in the drinking horns of the warriors thus fulfilling (in the same vein as Wealhþeow, the queen of Denmark) the important role of &quot;hostess&quot; and cup-bearer in the poem. The poet juxtaposes this virtue with the vice of Queen Modþryð (who appears in line 1932).

Beowulf gives her three horses and a magnificent torc (the &quot;Brosing&quot;, i.e. Brisingamen, the necklace of the goddess Freyja) that he received from Wealhþeow.

Hygd shows her wisdom and love for the Geatish people when her husband falls in the raid in Frisia against the Franks. Instead of securing the throne for her own offspring, she offers it to Beowulf as she considers her son Heardred to be too inexperienced to defend Geatland against the Swedes. Beowulf, however, talks in favour of young Heardred and convinces her to proclaim him King of the Geats instead.

Two Swedish princes, Eadgils and Eanmund, arrive and ask for protection as their uncle Onela had usurped the Swedish throne. Heardred graciously offers them his protection, which leads to a Swedish invasion in which Heardred is slain. The Swedish warrior Weohstan kills Eanmund, and Beowulf can no longer refuse Hygd&#x27;s offer of kingship.

<text>Quetta () is a district in the northwestern part of the Balochistan province of Pakistan. According to 2023 Pakistani census population of Quetta District is 2,272,290 (2.2 million).

It is part of Quetta Division. The district is famous for its agriculture produce, most notably fruit orchards, including apples and grapes. The Hanna Valley is an area where almonds are grown. The population counted in the 1998 census was , while in 2010 it was estimated at , and in 2017 at 2,275,699.

==History==
The ancient name of Quetta was Shalkot, a term by which it is still known among the people of the country. The district was held in turns by the Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Mongols, and towards the end of the fifteenth century was conferred by the ruler of Herat on Shah Beg Arghun, who, however, had shortly to give way before the rising power of the Mughals. The Ain-i-Akbari mentions both Shal and Pishin as supplying military service and revenue to Akbar, however these areas passed with Kandahar to the Safavids. On the rise of the Khilji power in Kandahar at the beginning of the eighteenth century, simultaneously with that of the Baloch in Kalat, Quetta and Pishin became i to the hand of british with the treaty of durand.

===British Era===
During the 19th century Quetta (Shalkot) was captured by the British troops during the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1879.

On the advance of the British Army of the Indus in 1839, Captain Bean was appointed the first Political Agent in Shalkot, and the country was managed by him on behalf of Shah Shuja-ul-mulk. After Sir Robert Sandeman&#x27;s mission to Kalat in 1876, the Quetta Fort was occupied by his escort and the country was managed on behalf of the Khan of Kalat up to 1883, when it was leased to the British Government for an annual rent of Rs. 25,000 through a treaty between Khan and the British Empire. It was formed, with Pishin and Shorarud, into a single administrative charge in 1883. Up to 1888 Old Chaman was the most advanced post on the frontier; but, on the extension of the railroad across the Khwaja Amran, the terminus was fixed at its present site, from that place. The boundary with Afghanistan was finally demarcated in 1895–1896.

The city area of Shalkot was inhabited by the Kasi tribe and the surroundings were occupied by the Bazai tribe with a few other nomads including the tribes of Sulaimankhail, Kharoti, Nasar, and Baitanai. Being on the outskirts of Kandahar, it was not much developed. With the arrival of British troops, doors of development were opened. Very soon, people saw roads, trains and schools in the area.

==Administrative divisions==
===Subdivisions===
In 1975, Quetta and Pishin were made separate districts. Quetta District today consists of two towns and one sub-tehsil. Quetta District was designated as a City District in 2001, having two tehsils and one sub-tehsil with a total of 67 union councils.

The district has a sex ratio of 103.48 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 56.29%: 65.06% for males and 46.96% for females. 720,934 (31.74% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. 1,565,546 (60.32%) live in urban areas.

=== Religion ===
In the 2023 census, Islam was the predominant religion at 98.59% of the population, while Christians were 1.1% of the population.

Around 200,000 speakers of &#x27;Other&#x27; languages were recorded in the census, mainly Hazaragi. Hazaras, who speak Dari, are one of the other main ethnic groups in Quetta, having fled there as refugees since the 1990s.

In 1998, % of the population resided in urban areas. The major religion was Islam (%), but there were also Christian (%) and Hindu (0.5%) communities.

<doc id="988678" wikidata="Q816356" url="?curid=988678" title="Human torpedo">
<text>Human torpedoes or manned torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle on which the diver rides, generally in a seated position behind a fairing. They were used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The basic concept is still in use.

The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later (with a larger version) Britain, deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbors. The human torpedo concept has occasionally been used by recreational divers, although this use is closer to midget submarines.

More broadly, the term &quot;human torpedo&quot; was used in the past to refer to vehicles which are now referred to as wet submarines and diver propulsion vehicles. Midget submarines which are employed to directly support frogman operations, whether possessing airlocks or not, if used as underwater tugs to transport equipment and frogmen clinging to their exterior, also blur the line between the human torpedo and more sophisticated underwater vehicles.
==History of common wartime models==
The concept of a small, manned submarine carrying a bomb was developed and patented by a British naval officer in 1909, but was never used during the First World War. The Italian Navy experimented with a primitive tiny sub (Mignatta) carrying two men and a limpet mine: this craft successfully sank Austro-Hungarian battleship SMS &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; on 1 November 1918.

The first truly practical human torpedo was the Italian &quot;maiale&quot;, electrically propelled by a motor in most of the units manufactured. With a top speed of , it often took up to two hours to reach its target. Two crewmen in diving suits rode astride, each equipped with an oxygen rebreather apparatus. They steered the craft to the enemy ship. The &quot;pig&quot; could be submerged to , and hypothetically to , when necessary. On arrival at the target, the detachable warhead was released for use as a limpet mine. If they were not detected, the operators then rode the mini sub away to safety.

Development began in 1935 but the first eleven were not completed until 1939 by San Bartolomeo Torpedo Workshops in La Spezia, Italy and a larger number followed. The official Italian name for the majority of the craft that were manufactured was &quot;Siluro Lenta Corsa&quot; (SLC or &quot;Slow-running torpedo&quot;). Two distinct models were made, Series100 and then (in 1942) Series200 with some improvements. At least 50 SLCs were built by September 1943.

In operation, &quot;maiali&quot; were carried by another vessel (usually a conventional submarine), and launched near the target. Most manned torpedo operations were at night and during the new moon to cut down the risk of being seen. Attacks in 1940 were unsuccessful but in 1941, the Italian navy successfully entered the harbor of Alexandria and damaged the two British battleships and , as well as the tanker &quot;Sagona&quot;. This feat encouraged the British to develop their own torpedo &quot;chariots&quot;.

The last Italian model, the SSB (for &quot;Siluro San Bartolomeo&quot;, &quot;San Bartolomeo Torpedo&quot;) was built with a partly enclosed cockpit, a more powerful motor and larger warhead (up from the earlier SLC&#x27;s warheads). Three units were made but not operationally used because Italy surrendered in 1943.

The first British version of the concept was named the Chariot manned torpedo. Two models were made; MarkI was long while MarkII was long, each suitable for carrying two men. Later versions were larger, starting with the original X-class submarine, a midget submarine, long, no longer truly a human torpedo but similar in concept. The X-Class were capable of on the surface or submerged. They were designed to be towed to their intended area of operations by a full-size &#x27;mother&#x27; submarine.

The German navy also developed a manned torpedo by 1943, the &quot;Neger&quot;, intended for one man, with a top speed of and carrying one torpedo; the frequent technical problems often resulted in the deaths of operators. Roughly 200 of these were made and they did manage to sink a few ships. The later &quot;Marder&quot; (pine marten in English) was about long and more sophisticated and could dive to depths of but with very limited endurance. About 500 were built.

==Construction==
A typical manned torpedo has a propeller, hydroplanes, a vertical rudder and a control panel with controls for its front rider. It usually allows for two riders who sit facing forwards. It has navigation aids such as a compass, and nowadays modern aids such as sonar and GPS positioning and modulated ultrasound communications gear. It may have an air (or other breathing gas) supply so its riders do not have to drain their own apparatus while they are riding it. In some the riders&#x27; seats are enclosed; in others the seats are open at the sides as in sitting astride a horse. The seat design includes room for the riders&#x27; swimfins (if used). There are flotation tanks (typically four: left fore, right fore, left aft, right aft), which can be flooded or blown empty to adjust buoyancy and attitude.

==Timeline==

*1909: The British designer Commander Godfrey Herbert received a patent for a manned torpedo. It was rejected by the War Office as impracticable and unsafe.
*1 November 1918: Two men of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, Raffaele Paolucci and Raffaele Rossetti, in diving suits, rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed &quot;Mignatta&quot; or &quot;leech&quot;) into the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Pola (Istria), where they sank the Austrian battleship and the freighter &quot;Wien&quot; using limpet mines. They had no breathing sets so they had to keep their heads above water, and thus were discovered and taken prisoner.
*1938: In Italy the &quot;1a Flottiglia Mezzi d&#x27;Assalto&quot; (First Fleet Assault Vehicles) was formed as a result of the research and development efforts of two men – Major Teseo Tesei and Major Elios Toschi of the Italian Royal Navy. The pair resurrected the idea of Paolucci and Rossetti.
*1940: Commander Vittorio Moccagatta of the Italian Royal Navy reorganised the 1st Fleet Assault Vehicles into the &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; (Tenth Light Flotilla of assault vehicles) or &quot;X-MAS&quot;, under the command of Ernesto Forza. It secretly manufactured manned torpedoes and trained war frogmen, called &quot;nuotatori&quot; (Italian: &quot;swimmers&quot;).
*26 July 1941: An attack on Valletta Harbour ended in disaster for the X MAS and Major Teseo Tesei lost his life.
*19 December 1941: The Decima Flottiglia MAS attacked the port of Alexandria with three &quot;maiali&quot;. The battleships and (and an 8,000-ton tanker) were sunk in shallow water putting them out of action for many months. Luigi Durand de la Penne and five other swimmers were taken prisoner. De la Penne was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor after the war.
*October 1942: Two British Chariot manned torpedoes were carried aboard the Shetland bus fishing-boat &quot;Arthur&quot; to attack the on Operation Title. They were swung overboard once in Norwegian waters but both became detached from their tow hooks in a gale and the operation was a total failure.
*8 December 1942. An attack by three manned torpedoes from the against British naval targets was thwarted in Gibraltar. Three divers were killed by depth charges when the British harbour defence &quot;reacted furiously&quot; to the attack. Among the dead were Lieutenant Licio Visintini, commander of the divers unit on board the &quot;Olterra&quot;, Petty Officer Giovanni Magro and Sergeant Salvatore Leone, from Taormina, Sicily. Leone&#x27;s body was never found. Sergeant Leone was awarded the &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;oro al Valor Militare&quot; and a memorial was erected in the Community Gardens in Taormina on the 50th anniversary of the attack. The memorial includes a rebuilt &quot;maiale&quot; and a description of the events, in three languages.
*1–2 January 1943: British submarines , and took part in Operation Principal. &quot;P311&quot; was lost en route to La Maddelena but the other two boats had some success at Palermo, launching two and three Chariots respectively. The &quot;Ulpio Traiano&quot; was sunk and the stern torn off &quot;Viminale.&quot; However the cost was high with one submarine and one chariot lost and all but two charioteers captured.
*18 January 1943: &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; took two chariots to Tripoli for Operation Welcome. This was to prevent blockships being sunk at the harbour mouth, so denying access to the Allies. Again, partial success was achieved. This was the last operation in which chariots were carried in containers on British submarines, although some others followed with the chariots on deck without containers.
*6 May &amp; 10 June 1943: Italian &quot;maiali&quot; from the &quot;Olterra&quot;, now under the command of Lieutenant Ernesto Notari, sank six Allied merchant ships in Gibraltar, for a total of 42,000 tons.
*September 1943: Operation Source was an attempt to destroy warships including the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; using X-class midget subs. Of the five deployed, only two were successful. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was badly damaged, crippled, and out of action until May 1944.
*2 October 1943: A bigger Italian frogman-carrier, long and carrying four frogmen, called &quot;Siluro San Bartolomeo&quot;, or SSB, was going to attack Gibraltar, but Italy surrendered and the attack was called off.
*21 June 1944: A British-Italian joint operation was mounted against shipping in La Spezia harbour. The chariots were carried on board an MTB and the cruiser &quot;Bolzano&quot; was sunk.
*6 July 1944: A German Neger-type vessel torpedoed the Royal Navy minesweepers and &quot;Cato&quot;.
*8 July 1944: A German Neger-type torpedo manned by Lieutenant Potthast heavily damaged the Polish light cruiser off the Normandy beaches.
*20 July 1944: Royal Navy destroyer was mined at anchor in Seine Bay. A German Human Torpedo was believed responsible.
*27–28 October 1944: The British submarine carried two &quot;Mk 2 Chariots&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Tiny&quot; and &quot;Slasher&quot;) to an attack on Phuket harbor in Thailand. See British commando frogmen for more information about this attack. No manned torpedo operations in combat in any war are known with certainty after this date.
*20 November 1944: The USS &quot;Mississinewa&quot; was sunk by a Japanese &quot;kaiten&quot; manned suicide torpedo.
*Immediate post-war period: The British Chariots were used to clear mines and wrecks in harbours.

For other events, see Operations of X Flottiglia MAS and British commando frogmen.

Some nations including Italy have continued to build and deploy manned torpedoes since 1945.

==Italy==


===World War I===
*Raffaele Rossetti in 1918 created a new weapon, based on his idea of a torpedo manned by a person, to be linked to enemy vessels underwater and explode under the ship hull. This weapon was called a &quot;mignatta&quot; (leech) and was the precursor of the &quot;maiali&quot; of World WarII.

===World War II===
*Siluro a Lenta Corsa (Italian, Low Speed Torpedo – SLC), also known as a &quot;maiale&quot;.
*Siluro San Bartolomeo (Italian, St. Bartholomew Torpedo, also called SSB). It was never used in action.
For information on Italian manned torpedo operations, see Decima Flottiglia MAS.

===After 1945===
*CE2F/X100 is a swimmer delivery vehicle made after 1945. They were made in Italy. Range . Two riders. The Pakistan Navy has several of them. India and Argentina also have some. Recent upgrades included:
**control module with a GPS
**autopilot
**digitized on board electronics
**launcher for five LCAW mini-torpedoes (optional)

==United Kingdom==
===World War II===

*Chariot Mark I, long, wide, high, speed , weight: 1.6 tonnes, maximum diving depth: . Endurance five hours (distance depended on water current). Its control handle was in the shape of a sideways figure-eight. Thirty-four examples were made.
*Chariot Mark II, long, diameter, maximum height, weight , maximum speed , range 5–6 hours at full speed, had two riders, who sat back to back. Thirty examples were made.
:Both types of the Chariot were made by Stothert &amp; Pitt at Bath, Somerset.
*Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC), nicknamed &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, a crewed wet submersible with a capacity of one frogman, used for clandestine operations, sabotage, and reconnaissance.
*X-class submarine, nicknamed &quot;X-Craft&quot;, a true midget submarine with both diesel and electric propulsion, possessing both a periscope and an airlock for frogman egress and entry. During Operation Source, a sortie of X-Craft was successful in sinking the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in shallow water while the vessel was at anchorage behind anti-torpedo nets in Kåfjord. The attack did not destroy the vessel, which was raised and repaired.
*XE-class submarine, an improved and enlarged version of the X-class. The vehicles were used in the Pacific theater, cutting underwater communication cables and also successfully sinking the &quot;Takao&quot; in Singapore harbor.
*Welman submarine, a midget submarine with a pressurized interior, meant to deploy magnetic limpet mines against the hulls of immobile vessels, and potentially also support frogman operations as a tug. The vehicle did not have a periscope and relied on the pilot&#x27;s cupola emerging from below the water to orient itself against terrain and targets, as well as visually assessing its targets at short range underwater. Despite over a hundred units constructed, they were used operationally only once and assessed as being unsuccessful.
*Welfreighter submarine, a true midget submarine intended to support frogman operations and serve as a clandestine agent transport, transporting both men and equipment. The vehicle&#x27;s propulsion system used the same type of diesel engine as employed on the X-class.

===After 1945===

*Archimedes DPV, nicknamed &quot;Archie&quot;, a modification of the Mark 20 Bidder ASW torpedo into a diver propulsion vehicle with deployable handlebars and an internal cargo compartment, which could function either autonomously or under direct control by a frogman.
*Subskimmer DPV, a hybrid of a motorized rigid inflatable boat while on the surface, and a battery electric submersible while underwater. Frogmen can cling or hitch themselves onto the vehicle while it&#x27;s underwater, with the pilot seated in a kneeling position.
*Mark 8 SDV, a crewed wet submersible and swimmer delivery vehicle originally in use by the United States Navy.
*Mark 11 SWCS, a crewed wet submersible and swimmer delivery vehicle.

==Germany==
===World War II===

*Hecht, a midget submarine similar in design and application to the British Welman, constructed after studying the British X-Craft captured after the attack on the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The Hecht had a complement of two crewmen and normally carried both a limpet mine on its nose section and a conventional torpedo slung beneath, on a slip rail mount. Propulsion was all-electric, using a standard electric torpedo motor, and the vehicle was designed to always be submerged; consequently, range was poor, with the vehicle intended to be towed to the vicinity of the target by a conventional submarine. Optionally, instead of a limpet mine, the Hecht could carry a third operative - a frogman equipped with a diving suit, riding astride the vehicle.
*Neger, a submersible constructed on the basis of a G7e torpedo with a second, normal G7e carried beneath it, launched from a slip rail mount. An extreme form of a genuine &quot;human torpedo&quot; which could function as both a swimmer delivery vehicle and an armed midget submarine. The Neger was long, with a body diameter of . Total displacement, together with the payload, was approximately 5 tons. Top speed was . The Neger was incapable of diving, set to a shallow depth; it relied on the extremely small profile of the pilot&#x27;s cupola which projected above the waterline as well as the cover of night for stealth. The crew complement consisted of a single pilot. This manned torpedo was named after its inventor, Richard Mohr.

*Marder, an improvement upon the Neger with the addition of a diving tank and other features. The maximum diving depth was limited by the G7e depth-keeping mechanism at , with normal operational depth not exceeding . The Marder was long, with a body diameter of . Total displacement, together with the payload, was approximately 5.5 tons. Top speed was . The crew complement consisted of a single pilot.
*Hai, an experimental craft based upon the Marder. The body was lengthened, with additional batteries installed in the midsection. The Hai was long, with a body diameter of . Total displacement, together with the payload, was approximately 6 tons. Top speed was . The depth characteristics were identical to those of the Marder. The crew complement consisted of a single pilot. Only a single unit was constructed, which was assessed as lacking maneuverability. 
*Biber, midget submarines which carried two torpedoes and one or two men. There were other types that never reached production.
In July 1944, the Kriegsmarine introduced their human torpedoes to harass allied positions at Normandy anchorages. Although they could not submerge, they were difficult to observe at night and inflicted several losses on allied vessels. They were also used to harass allied vessels in the invasion of southern France but were largely ineffective.

==Japan==
===World War II===
*The &quot;Kaiten&quot; was a manned fast torpedo intended to be piloted directly into its target, in practice becoming a suicide weapon. As such, its operation differed substantially from the human torpedo as used by Italian, British and German militaries.

==Russia/USSR==
===After 1945===
*Siren. It is or was made after 1945. It is longer than a British or Italian Chariot because it has two warheads. It has two riders. It was designed to exit through a submarine&#x27;s torpedo tube. See Russian commando frogmen.

==United States==
===After 1945===
There are pictures and descriptions of modern US Chariot-like underwater frogman-carriers used by SEALs and a fast surface boat that can submerge, here:
*Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) SEAL Delivery Vehicle
*Swimmer Transport Device (STD)

==North Korea==
It has been reported that North Korea has developed and deployed human torpedoes as part of its unconventional warfare tactics. These units, which are part of the 17th Sniper Corps, operate at the brigade level both in the East and in the West Sea Fleets. Each sea fleet has one suicide unit comprising elite soldiers who are well-fed and treated to a standard of living that is superior to that of submarine crews, even during periods of widespread economic hardship. The training regimen is focused on the execution of suicide bombing attacks.

Initially, the agents travel on submarines, but at a later stage, they embark on torpedoes, which they direct towards their targets. The agents are instructed to utilize a favorable tide to depart for their target, attach a magnetic bomb to it, retreat with the ebb tide, detonate the explosives remotely, and return to base via a small submarine. Possibly, light torpedoes could be fired at close range instead of planting remotely detonated explosives. Despite the fact that torpedo carriers are informed that they can escape, it is often exceedingly challenging in practice.

==Other countries==
===Argentina===
Argentina developed manned torpedoes and special mini-submarines in the 1950s, the latter with a torpedo attached under the two-men crew. Their crews were trained by , a former member of the Italian Decima MAS.

===Poland===
In the months before the outbreak of the Second World War, a number of Polish volunteers came forward to pilot torpedoes against German warships. A Bureau of Living Torpedoes was set up to organize and train these volunteers, and prepare suitable equipment, but nothing had come to fruition before the German invasion and occupation.

===Yugoslavia===
The Yugoslav Navy did not have manned torpedoes, but frogmen used the underwater device called &quot;R-1 Diver&quot; for a variety of missions including mine clearance, infiltration, clandestine surveillance and security, and assault missions on enemy shipping and naval objects.
These small apparatuses were relegated to the navies of Croatia (HRM) (1991) and Montenegro (2007).

==Museums==

*Original SLCs (Siluri Lenta Corsa or &quot;maiali&quot;), displayed at the Naval History Museum Venice, Italy.
*There are three chariots on public view in Eden Camp Museum near Malton, North Yorkshire in England:
**A restored original British Mark II, which was found derelict in a scrapyard in Portsmouth. In this design, the two riders sat back to back.
**A working chariot that was made in 1992 in Milton Keynes with approximately the outside appearance of a British wartime MarkI, but with differing internal working parts. It has been filmed in action for the television. It has a warhead. It was last used in 2006.
**A replica Italian &quot;maiale&quot; made soon after 1945 by the same Italian firm (Caproni) who made the wartime &quot;maiali&quot;. As of July 2008 this was on loan to the National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth, Cornwall, until the end of 2008, but as of 16 March 2009 it was back in Eden Camp.
*There is an Italian SSB &quot;maiale&quot; in the Naval Museum at Groton, Connecticut, United States.

==Movies and fiction==
*The movie &quot;The Valiant&quot;, made in 1962, is about the sinking of HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; in Alexandria harbour. There is even a 1953 Italian movie (&quot;I sette dell&#x27;Orsa Maggiore&quot; Hell Raiders of the Deep) about the attack, done with some real members of Decima Flottiglia MAS as support actors in the cast.
*The film &quot;Above Us the Waves&quot; (released in 1955) concentrates on the midget submarine attack on the . The film has a scene of a fight between British and German frogmen at an anti-submarine net; this never happened in the real attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.
*The film &quot;The Silent Enemy&quot; (released in 1958) does not represent real events accurately. In particular, in the real world there was no attack on the &quot;Olterra&quot;, and no underwater hand-to-hand battle between Italian and British frogmen. The breathing sets used by the film actors representing the Italian frogmen seem to be British naval type rebreathers and not authentic Italian rebreathers. The three chariots seen in the movie, representing Italian &quot;maiali&quot;, were crudely made film props.
*A film &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; briefly features a German paratroop Officer, a Colonel played by Michael Caine and his men who have been sent to man chariots on the Channel Islands.
*Ian Fleming who wrote the James Bond stories was in Naval Intelligence stationed at Gibraltar in the war, and was likely aware of the Italian operations. The chariot seen in the James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; is a realistic-looking but non-functioning film prop. When seen it is in a kit store. It does not take part in any action; the action happens up a mountain in the Swiss Alps. Underwater vehicles (not chariot-shaped) featured in the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;.
*In &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Solid Snake uses one to approach &quot;Shadow Moses island&quot;.
*In Infinity Ward&#x27;s &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, Operators from &quot;Task Force 141&quot; uses two of these to approach one of the four oil rigs. This takes place in the mission: &quot;The only easy day, was yesterday&quot;.
*In the game &quot;&quot;, Kaitens and Kaiten-carrying submarines are player-controllable units.
*In &quot;Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2&quot;, the only mission set in Norway, entitled &quot;Operation Seawolf: Steam Piping&quot;, is based on the failed Operation Title from 31 October 1942 against Tirpitz.

<text>Temple of Apshai (also known as Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai) is a dungeon crawl role-playing video game developed and published by Automated Simulations (later renamed to Epyx) in 1979. Originating on the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, it was followed by several updated versions for other computers between 1980 and 1986.

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; is considered one of the first graphical role-playing games for home computers, predating even the commercial release of Richard Garriott&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. It was an enormous success for its era, selling 400,000 copies by 1986.

It was followed by several sequels and two expansions. The latter were bundled with the main game into the remake &quot;Temple of Apshai Trilogy&quot; in 1985. Games using the &quot;Apshai&quot; engine were collectively known as the &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; series.

==Gameplay==

The player in &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; assumes the role of an adventurer who explores the mysterious ruins of the Temple of Apshai. The player character investigates room after room of the dungeon crawl while seeking treasure and combatting monsters. Along the way, the player discovers powerful weapons and armor with which to overcome the Temple&#x27;s inhabitants. The game consists of four dungeons with over 200 rooms in total and features 30 monster types.

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; consists of two programs: the Innkeeper and the Dunjonmaster. The game starts with the Innkeeper and the choice to either generate a new character or input an existing one. The game uses six base values taken from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Early tape versions of the game had no means to save progress. The player was prompted to write down all statistics when quitting the game and had to type them in when resuming play. Later floppy versions fixed this by saving the status on the disk. Weapons and armor are purchased in a shop, where it is possible to haggle with the shopkeeper for a discount. Character stats determine which items can be worn. Finally, the player chooses between four dungeons of increasing difficulty to enter the Dunjonmaster part.

In the Dunjonmaster program, the screen is divided into a birds-eye view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player&#x27;s turn can be used to walk up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn&#x27;t make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervals regardless. All actions decrease the player character&#x27;s fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was the first computer role-playing game with room descriptions. Detailed descriptions of all the rooms in the game&#x27;s manual complement the sparse graphics and provide vital information. Pen-and-paper games like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; frequently make use of verbal depictions given by dungeon masters to suggest to players what is of interest in a setting. Similarly, in &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; the player matches an on-screen room number to its entry in the manual that accompanies the game. One sample entry reads: &quot;The aroma of vanilla makes the senses reel and the floor of the room is covered with the shiny stuff previously observed. Bones lie scattered across the floor and the clicking sound grows fainter from within. Gems stud the south wall.&quot; A vanilla scent is used in the game to suggests the presence of Antmen, the dominant monster type in the temple.

When beaten by a monster, the player character may be rescued by one of several non-player characters. Depending on the rescuer, a portion of the player&#x27;s inventory is removed as payment.

The game has no particular goal other than fighting monsters, collecting treasure and gaining experience points.

==Development and releases==

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was originally programmed by Jim Connelley, founder and president of Automated Simulations / Epyx Software, for TRS-80 and Commodore PET, using BASIC. The role-playing system, named &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; was designed by Jon Freeman, while the level design of the dungeons was provided by Jeff Johnson (&quot;Roadwar 2000&quot;).

According to Connelley, his motivations to create &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; were &quot;the popularity of noncomputer role-playing games&quot; and the opportunity &quot;to create a graphics-oriented adventure game&quot;. Like most early computer RPGs, &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was influenced by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Both Connelley and Freeman played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in a group where Connelley acted as the Dungeon Master. An advertisement for &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; called the game a &quot;version of Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and described Connelly as an experienced &quot;Dungeon Master, running continuous D &amp; D campaigns&quot;. The game&#x27;s documentation included instructions for importing pen-and-paper role-playing game player characters.

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was first released in August 1979. The original release contained the program cassette and the manual in a plastic bag, an unusually professional packaging for the time. Early advertisements promoted versions for TRS-80 and Commodore PET, but a version for the Apple II followed in 1980. The TRS-80, Apple II, and PET versions were sold for $24.95 on cassette and $29.95 on disk.

A port to Atari 8-bit computers was advertised by retailers from winter 1981, while Epyx announced a version for IBM PC compatibles to be released in March 1982. Aric Wilmunder coded the Atari program, while Connelley himself is credited for the IBM PC version. In 1983, the game was released for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64, sold at $39.95. Connelley identified Steve Bryson as the programmer of the Commodore 64 version.

In 1983, Gessler Educational Software distributed a French language version with the title &quot;Le Temple D&#x27;Apshaï&quot; for the purpose of French language education. Both the game and manual were translated entirely, kept in a French Canadian writing style.

in 1984, a Version was made for the Mac Classic under contract with Applied Computer Technology, Inc. located in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was authored by Louis Castle.

==Legacy==

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was the first game in Automated Simulations&#x27; &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; series, which span ten individual titles, including expansions, smaller games, and a full sequel, &quot;Hellfire Warrior&quot;.

Two of the releases, &quot;Upper Reaches of Apshai&quot; and &quot;Curse of Ra&quot;, were add-ons to &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; which required the original program to run. The level design and room descriptions for both were created by Tim Bird, Mark Madrid and Andrew Martin. &quot;Upper Reaches of Apshai&quot; contains four new dungeon levels for beginning characters, and conveys a more humorous tone with suburban environments like a vegetable garden and enemies like killer tomatoes. &quot;Curse of Ra&quot; is set in ancient Egypt and has higher difficulty. It also consists of four dungeon levels, with 179 rooms total.

In 1983, Epyx released the action-oriented &quot;Gateway to Apshai&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; whose story is set at a time before the Temple of Apshai, where the original game took place, was rediscovered.

In 1985, Epyx published the remake &quot;Temple of Apshai Trilogy&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was very successful. Automated Simulations reported that it had sold 20,000 copies of the game by 1981, and 30,000 copies by June 1982. It remained a best-seller for at least four years, with sales reached 400,000 copies by 1986. After the Commodore 64 Version was released in 1983, it appeared on top of the &quot;Compute! Gazette&quot; list of best-selling Commodore 64 Entertainment programs, generated from surveys with retailers and distributors. It constantly remained among the five best-selling Commodore 64 games according to that list until the column was discontinued after March 1984. The VIC-20 version also appeared on the list of best-selling games for that system from December 1983 onwards. At the middle of June 1983, the wholesale software distributor Softsel International placed &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; seventh in a list of best-selling computer games, compiled from sales to 4,000 retail outlets in 50 states and 30 countries. By that time, the game had been in the distributor&#x27;s top 50 chart for 38 weeks. &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was Epyx&#x27;s third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987.

Early reviews of &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphics and unusual complexity, while criticizing long loading times and slow screen build-up for the dungeon graphics. &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; for the PET &quot;is for anyone who is tired of simple &#x27;video games&#x27; ... [it] is quite an experience&quot;. It advised readers to be aware that &quot;this is a serious game. Be prepared to THINK&quot;. Jerry Pournelle in &quot;BYTE&quot; called it &quot;an excellent real-time dungeon game&quot;, and later reported that his sons had &quot;nearly worn out the Dungeons of Apshai&quot;. &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; criticized the long load times, but liked the game&#x27;s graphics and &quot;excellent&quot; documentation. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; stated that the IBM PC version did not fully exploit the computer&#x27;s graphics capability, but that players &quot;will find excitement and entertainment ... it&#x27;s certainly worth the silver to grab this game for the PC&quot;. The magazine was also favorable towards &quot;Upper Reaches of Apshai&quot;, which it called &quot;better than &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; in some ways&quot;. &quot;Popular Science&quot; called &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; &quot;a good example of a graphic adventure game&quot;, but also stated that in it and other games like it &quot;the play seems to drag&quot; because &quot;it takes time to draw the pictures&quot;. &quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; an overall B rating, concluding that it was &quot;an excellent game, one that&#x27;s very involving&quot;, and gave the same grade to &quot;Hellfire Warrior&quot; and &quot;Curse of Ra&quot;.

Robert Plamondon reviewed &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; for &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine and stated that &quot;I found both &quot;Datestones of Ryn&quot; and &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; highly enjoyable. &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; is more expensive, but well worth the extra cost because it is so much bigger than &quot;Datestones of Ryn&quot;.&quot;

In 1991 and 1993 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Scorpia stated that the graphics &quot;caused a sensation when it first appeared&quot;, but also criticized a lack of polish in the programming and slow speed due to the use of BASIC, issues which were improved upon in the Atari 8-bit version. A 2012 overview of TRS-80 games described it as &quot;slow, clunky and crash-prone ... this early attempt at an action role-playing game managed little of either&quot;, and inferior to later Atari and Commodore versions, but &quot;quite clearly compelling&quot; as an early dungeon crawl.

&quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; was awarded the Origins Award for &quot;Best Computer Game of 1980&quot;, the first to receive this distinction.

<text>Zombie Nation is the project of German DJ and producer Florian Senfter. Zombie Nation&#x27;s single &quot;Kernkraft 400&quot; was a worldwide hit.

==History==
The first Zombie Nation EP was released in the spring of 1999 on DJ Hell&#x27;s label, International DeeJay Gigolo Records. A remix of the song &quot;Kernkraft 400&quot; on this debut release reached high chart positions all over the world, including number 2 in the United Kingdom.

Since 2001, Florian Senfter has released tracks on different labels under Zombie Nation and his other pseudonym John Starlight. In 2002, he did not renew his contract with International DeeJay Gigolo Records and started his own label, Dekathlon Records, where he released his second album &quot;Absorber&quot; in 2003. In early 2005, the new sublabel UKW Records was launched with John Starlight&#x27;s &quot;John&#x27;s Addiction Part 1&quot; followed by &quot;Paeng Paeng 12&quot;&quot; by Zombie Nation which was recorded a few months later. Sven Väth realized the potential of the song at first glance and licensed it for his Cocoon Recordings imprint.

The third album &quot;Black Toys&quot; which was released in 2006 on UKW Records Zombie Nation is a bass dominated soundscape from tech-hop to funk-laden house. 

In 2007, Zombie Nation collaborated with Tiga under the pseudonym ZZT on the recording &quot;Lower State of Consciousness&quot;.

Zombie Nation is also known today as an electronic music live act. Unusually for a DJ, he uses musical hardware on stage to create sounds. The main instrument is an Akai MPC 4000 Music sequencer which he uses in combination with a mixing console and several effects units to do a live arrangement and Mix of his music.

In December 2009 and January 2010, Zombie Nation created an orchestrated track, and Florian tells the story like so: 

The result was a track by &quot;Zombie Nation and Friends&quot; titled &quot;The Mind of Many&quot;.

<text>Bonnie Steinbock (born 1947) is a professor emerita of philosophy at the University at Albany and a specialist in bioethics who has written on topics such as abortion, end of life issues, and animal rights.

==Biography==

Steinbock received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. She is a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution. She now lives in Oakland, CA, with her husband, Paul Menzel. In retirement, she has been a visiting professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In retirement, she continues to publish, her most recent article being &quot;Physician-Assisted Death and Severe, Treatment-Resistant Depression,&quot; Hastings Center Report 47, no. 5 (2017): 30-42. In November 2018, she delivered &quot;The Ethics of Editing Embryos,&quot; at the National Conference of Bioethics in Shanghai, China.

Questions from her examinations have appeared in the &quot;Education Life&quot; section of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==&quot;Life Before Birth&quot;==
Bonnie Steinbock is the author of &quot;Life Before Birth,&quot; published by Oxford University Press in 1992. As stated in the subtitle, the book discusses the &quot;moral and legal status of embryos and fetuses.&quot; Chapter One goes into detail about the &quot;interest view,&quot; the idea that all and only beings who have interests have moral status. The interest view is used to distinguish whose interests we are required to take into consideration. Besides the interest view, Steinbock touched on the legal status of the fetus. From prenatal injury torts, prenatal wrongful deaths, and criminal law, Steinbock gives details about each type of legislation surrounding the fetus. Steinbock further explains consciousness and nonconscious individuals and how that relates to interests. Chapters Two through Six build on the idea that beings with interests have moral status. These chapters discuss abortion, the legal status of the fetus, maternal-fetal conflict, fetal research, and embryo research.

==Views on animal pain==

According to Steinbock, the pain of animals is a morally relevant consideration but is not morally decisive. This differs from Peter Singer&#x27;s view that there is no essential difference between the pain of non-human animals and that of human beings, and also differs from William Baxter&#x27;s view that animals have no moral consideration on their own whatsoever.

Also, she argues that there are &quot;morally&quot; good reasons for taking our own species as morally special, and thus the interests of non-human animals in relation to pain are not as important as those of human beings—though she admits those interests to be existent.

Furthermore, Steinbock affirms speciesism. For her, humans are more important than non-human animals, though non-human animals, &quot;in their own right&quot;, have moral status because they have interests of their own. Beings without interests of their own (e.g., plants, wilderness areas, species, works of art, embryos) do not have moral status, but may have moral value, if there are moral reasons to protect or preserve them. These reasons do not stem from their interests, since they do not have any interests of their own, and so are not &quot;golden-rule type&quot; reasons, but may be morally very important.

Steinbock has stated that &quot;We do not subject animals to different moral treatment simply because they have fur and feathers, but because they are in fact different from human beings in ways that could be morally relevant&quot;.

<doc id="988698" wikidata="Q6946990" url="?curid=988698" title="Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis">
<text>Mycobacterium avium&quot; subspecies &quot;paratuberculosis (MAP) is an obligate pathogenic bacterium in the genus &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. It is often abbreviated M. paratuberculosis or M. avium&quot; ssp. &quot;paratuberculosis. It is the causative agent of Johne&#x27;s disease, which affects ruminants such as cattle, and suspected causative agent in human Crohn&#x27;s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The type strain is ATCC 19698 (equivalent to CIP 103963 or DSM 44133).

==Pathophysiology==
MAP causes Johne&#x27;s disease in cattle and other ruminants. It has long been suspected as a causative agent in Crohn&#x27;s disease in humans, but studies have been unable to show definite correlation. One study has argued that the presence of antibodies against &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; subspecies &quot;paratuberculosis&quot; is associated with increased propensity of patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease to receive biological therapy.

Recent studies have shown that MAP present in milk can survive pasteurization, which has raised human health concerns due to the widespread nature of MAP in modern dairy herds. MAP survival during pasteurization is dependent on the D72C-value of the strains present and their concentration in milk. It is heat resistant and is capable of sequestering itself inside white blood cells, which may contribute to its persistence in milk. It has also been reported to survive chlorination in municipal water supplies.

MAP is a slow growing organism and is difficult to culture. Bacterial cultures were regarded as Gold standards for detection of MAP. Detection is very limited in fresh tissues, food, and water. Recently, John Aitken and Otakaro Pathways have discovered a method to culture MAP from human blood. Testing is ongoing. Professor John Hermon-Taylor of King&#x27;s College London is developing a new vector type anti MAP vaccine which he claims is both curative and preventative. Stage 1 human trials began in January 2017 and concluded successfully in September 2019. He is also developing a companion MAP blood test.

It is not susceptible to antituberculosis drugs (which can generally kill &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;). MAP is susceptible to antibiotics used to treat Mycobacterium avium disease, such as rifabutin and clarithromycin, however the capacity of these antibiotics to eradicate MAP infection in vivo has not been established.

===Crohn&#x27;s disease===
MAP is recognized as a multi-host mycobacterial pathogen with a proven specific ability to initiate and maintain systemic infection and chronic inflammation of the intestine of a range of histopathological types in many animal species, including primates.

MAP has been found in larger numbers within the intestines of Crohn&#x27;s disease patients and in significant amount of irritable bowel syndrome patients compared to those with ulcerative colitis or otherwise healthy controls. One study concluded that MAP &quot;may act as a causative agent, have a role in the context of secondary infection, which may exacerbate the disease, or represent non-pathogenic colonisation.&quot; The Crohns MAP Vaccine is an experimental vaccine based on this hypothesis.

==Genome==
The genome of MAP strain K-10 was sequenced in 2005 and found to consist of a single circular chromosome of 4,829,781 base pairs, and to encode 4,350 predicted ORFs, 45 tRNAs, and one rRNA operon.

<text>The Nushagak River () is a river in southwest Alaska, United States. It begins in the Alaska Range and flows southwest to Nushagak Bay, an inlet of Bristol Bay, east of Dillingham, Alaska.

The Mulchatna River is a major tributary. Other navigable tributaries include the Nuyakuk River and the King Salmon River.

Jet-boats are commonly used to access these tributaries and the upper Nushagak. The Wood River, Iowithla River and the Kokwok River are smaller tributaries.
The villages of Portage Creek, Ekwok, Koliganek and New Stuyahok are on the river. The town of Dillingham (Pop. 2,466) is on Nushagak Bay.

The Nushagak River is downstream of the proposed Pebble Mine, whose tailings storage lake would sit at the headwaters of the Koktuli River, one of the Nushagak&#x27;s tributaries. Villages on the Nushagak are among the major opponents of the proposal.

Five species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, coho, sockeye, chum, and pink) spawn in the river or its tributaries. Commercial, subsistence and sport fishing are important in the area. Most notable is the annual run of king (Chinook) salmon which occurs from mid-June to mid-July. Rainbow trout, northern pike, grayling, burbot, whitefish and Arctic char are also present in the Nushagak. It is estimated that over 50% of the world&#x27;s production of wild salmon is harvested in the Nushagak River and the Bristol Bay area.

<text>This is a list of characters who have appeared on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

==Main characters==
=== Notes ===
# Christa Miller only appeared in the first and second episodes in Season 8.
# Kathy Kinney is credited as a guest star in the pilot episode, but she is credited as Starring from the second episode on.
# Craig Ferguson was credited as Starring in all episodes of Season 8, but only appeared in 4 episodes.
# John Carroll Lynch appeared in 8 episodes in Season 8, and was only credited as Starring for the episodes he appeared in.

* Drew Carey (Drew Carey) – Drew Carey is the main protagonist of the series. A perpetual &quot;nice guy&quot;, for most of the series, he works in the human resources department of Winfred-Louder, a multinational department store chain. Drew is the founder and co-owner of Buzz Beer, a coffee-flavored caffeinated beer (at the time, such drinks were legal but uncommon in the United States). He has a long-standing feud with co-worker Mimi Bobeck; both play endless, occasionally complicated, seriously mean-spirited pranks on each other until she becomes his sister-in-law, after which they still dislike each other.
* Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney) – Mimi Bobeck is Mr. Wick&#x27;s assistant/secretary and the main antagonist of the series. Much like Fonzie from &quot;Happy Days&quot; and Steve Urkel from &quot;Family Matters&quot;, the Mimi character was originally a one-time character, only appearing in the pilot episode. She is an overweight woman who wears a lot of makeup, yet has a very high but unstable self-esteem. (As an in-joke, Mimi&#x27;s mother was played by known makeup addict Tammy Faye Bakker.) Mimi is Drew&#x27;s nemesis; she vowed to make Drew&#x27;s life a living hell after Drew denied her a job based on her makeup. Mimi&#x27;s pranks included gluing Drew&#x27;s hand to a pornographic magazine, covering Drew&#x27;s desk with garbage, and eventually sending Drew to China while he is unconscious. She is also known for calling him &quot;Pig&quot; and &quot;Doughboy.&quot; Mimi&#x27;s past has a lot of connections to the world of music; she often talks about being a roadie for Foghat and was married to Eddie Money for two weeks after appearing at his first concert. Additionally, she claims to have slept with both Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton. Later on, Mimi becomes more of a friend to Drew (they agree to put their feud on hold while Mimi dates and later marries his brother, Steve) and a loving, if unconventional, mother to Gus. Early in the series, it was revealed that Mimi was Catholic and of Polish ancestry, and inherited the title of Duchess of Kraków after her aunt died. (Starting in 2009, Mimi/Kinney resurfaced as a guest on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, hosted by Drew Carey since October 15, 2007, during the show&#x27;s April Fool&#x27;s episode, first in 2009 as a model and then ransacking Mike Richards&#x27; position as executive producer on the show, in 2010. Carey usually promotes Kinney&#x27;s next project during the closing of that episode.)
* Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) – Forming a double-act with Oswald, Lewis is tall, gangly, and perpetually bemused. Ryan Stiles once described Lewis as &quot;Not even a character at first, just a creep really.&quot; He possesses an IQ of 162, but works as a janitor for a company called DrugCo, which conducts bizarre experiments. Due to accidentally releasing a strain of bacteria into the population, he was busted down to janitor from a position that required him to wear a lab coat. At one point, he posed as Drew to take his physical exam for him, unexpectedly taking a psychiatric exam as well. He tried to give answers which he thought suited Drew&#x27;s life and situation, and the results showed him to be mentally unstable and possibly criminally insane. He mentioned in one episode he was adopted.
* Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) – Lewis&#x27;s slightly shorter, dark-haired friend is the dumb one of the double-act, which tends to be his most distinguishing characteristic. Lewis described him once as a &quot;man-child stuck in a sort of prolonged adolescence.&quot; Oswald was a deejay at the beginning of the first season but later on became a delivery driver for Global Parcel (a fictional package-delivery service whose uniforms are modeled after those of UPS). He later attempted to become a nurse, but he failed the required tests. Drew later got him a job as a delivery man for Never Ending Store, but Oswald was injured on store property. After receiving damages, he bought the Warsaw. In the episode &quot;Bus-ted&quot;, it is revealed that Oswald joined the group of friends to replace Adam, a childhood friend who fell through the ice on a lake. Aside from Carey, Bader is the only cast member to appear in every episode of the series. The name of Bader&#x27;s character is a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the gunman who assassinated President John F. Kennedy.
* Kate O&#x27;Brien (Christa Miller) – Friends with Drew, Lewis, and Oswald since they were kids. Kate is a bit of a tomboy and a hothead and good with her fists. She and Oswald almost got married at one point, but she called it off just after Oswald threw her a surprise wedding (essentially leaving Oswald at the altar). She later found out about Drew&#x27;s long-standing crush on her at their high school reunion, and she realized that she had feelings for him too. They dated for a season (even becoming engaged) but broke up when they disagreed about having kids. Drew and Kate were married for a short time in a later season, although this was illegal, as Drew had just become married to his old girlfriend, Nicki. Eventually, Drew&#x27;s sham was discovered and Kate felt betrayed. Drew eventually regained Kate&#x27;s trust and they became friends again. Kate left at the beginning of the eighth season, marrying a Naval aviator and moving from Cleveland to Guam.
* Nigel Algernon Wick (Craig Ferguson) – Drew&#x27;s boss after the first season, replacing Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak). English, crude, boisterous and offensive, he was also a cocaine addict before he was forced to go into rehab. For some time, he and Drew were in a same-sex marriage (technically a civil union) in order for Mr. Wick to get his green card and Drew to get his job back. When he first appeared on stage in guest episodes in the last two seasons he was greeted with thunderous applause. Wick always had unusual methods of firing employees (usually men surnamed Johnson), which he does in most episodes. He is almost always referred to as &quot;Mr. Wick&quot;, and his first name, Nigel, is rarely used. In the show&#x27;s first April Fool&#x27;s Day episode, Wick was shot in the crotch with a crossbow by an employee (named Johnson) whom he had just fired. Wick had to have one of his testicles removed. Wick also lost a toe and a nipple in a fox hunt that went terribly wrong. Craig Ferguson initially auditioned at Warner Bros. for a role as a Hispanic photographer on &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;, and after he failed his audition (with the role instead going to Cuban-American actor Nestor Carbonell), the casting director referred him to &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; which was auditioning across the studio. Ferguson, who is Scottish, played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent &quot;to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents.&quot; At the end of one episode, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.
* Steve Carey (John Carroll Lynch) – Drew&#x27;s straight but cross-dressing older brother. He came to Cleveland and got a job in the cosmetics department at Winfred-Louder. He fell in love with Mimi and after one season of dating they married in a ceremony in Drew&#x27;s backyard, with Drew officiating along with an online minister from an Internet website. In later seasons the concept of Steve being a cross-dresser is abandoned entirely with little explanation (though it is hinted that he gave it up to make Mimi happy). He left, along with Kate and Wick, early in the eighth season. John Carroll Lynch is in reality 5 years younger than Drew Carey.
* Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) – Drew&#x27;s childhood friend. She has had a crush on Drew since high school but never told him. She was married but her husband cheated on her with her sister. Her mother is an alcoholic and leaves her father, eventually hooking up with Lewis. After Kate leaves, Drew realizes that he loves Kellie. Drew is afraid to tell Kellie because it may ruin their friendship like it did with Kate. After Lily leaves Drew, they confess their feelings for each other. When Kellie comes out while Drew is talking to his dad and asks Drew what they are going to do about their feelings for each other, Drew&#x27;s dad falls off the roof and dies. Eventually during the beginning stage of their relationship Kellie finds out she is pregnant with Drew Jr. but won&#x27;t marry Drew because she doesn&#x27;t think he is ready for marriage. During the finale she decides Drew is ready. But her water breaks and she and Drew get married right when the baby is born.

==Drew&#x27;s marriages==
Much of the show&#x27;s humor revolved around Drew&#x27;s single life. However, Drew was married a number of times during the show&#x27;s run. His spouses during the series were:
* Diane (Nicole Sullivan) – A cocktail waitress Drew met on a business trip to Las Vegas. She tricked Drew into marrying her because she believed having a husband would give her an edge in winning custody of her children. Drew agreed to help her with the social workers, and they divorced a week later.
* Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) - Drew&#x27;s boss for the majority of the series, desperately wanted a spouse when his visa expired and he was threatened with deportation. He bribed Drew with a promotion and several benefits to get Drew to marry him in Vermont. They stayed married for just over a year to throw off any suspicion from the INS. Drew kicked Mr. Wick out of his house once Wick became too &quot;clingy&quot; with Drew&#x27;s friends and life.
* Nicki Fifer (Kate Walsh) - A real estate agent whom Drew dated and became engaged to; she dumped him after gaining a large amount of weight while they were dating (and, in her own words, &quot;couldn&#x27;t be with a man who loved to eat&quot;). She lost the weight, got married and came back to Drew after her divorce (when Drew had just left a mental institution). Drew asked her to marry him on an impulse, and she agreed. Unfortunately, Drew married Kate soon after (thus becoming a bigamist) and she left him. Nicki returned later, having regained all her previous weight, and attempted to kill Drew because she blamed him for all the recent problems in her life. Drew let Nicki stay at his house until she could get back on her feet, after which she was rarely seen again. Lewis helped her through something. He tried to have a relationship with her, but she refused. 
* Kate O&#x27;Brien (Christa Miller) – The love of Drew&#x27;s life and his best friend since childhood, Drew and Kate first broke off their engagement after a disagreement about having kids. After Drew&#x27;s stint in the mental hospital, Kate realized that she still loved Drew and asked him to marry her. Drew agreed (despite having recently married Nicki and still being married to Mr. Wick) and kept both his marriages a secret for a time. Both wives discovered the situation, and Kate, furious, dumped Drew and told the newspapers about the situation; Drew became known as &quot;The Impotent Bisexual Bigamist.&quot;
* Lily (Tammy Lauren) – A Southern belle who met Drew after Oswald and Lewis started a campaign to find him a wife. Drew brought Lily to Cleveland and attempted to establish a relationship with her, but found it difficult to deal with Lily&#x27;s night terrors. Drew ended up proposing to Lily on three different occasions: once in his house, another in a movie theater, and finally, back at his home again. After Drew tore up all of his pre-determined wedding plan receipts, Lily agreed to marry him. Lily left Drew after the wedding, driving off without him after giving Drew his ring back. At the reception, Drew and Kellie expressed their hidden love for each other and began their relationship, which would also lead to Drew&#x27;s final marriage.
* Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) – Drew&#x27;s childhood friend who was introduced in the eighth season. Drew went to a strip club and discovered that Kellie was working as a stripper to support herself after her divorce from her husband. Drew takes her into his home and their friendship blossoms. They were both reluctant to confess their feelings for each other, but they became a couple after Drew and Lily&#x27;s wedding. Kellie soon becomes pregnant, but refuses to marry Drew for another eight months. On their wedding day and the series finale, Kellie gave birth to Drew Jr.

==Recurring characters==
* Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) – One of Drew&#x27;s co-workers, Larry is a bumbling and somewhat unprofessional employee who is often willing to resort to less than savory methods to gain the upper hand. During a competition to determine the new employee representative on the Winfred-Louder board of directors, he managed to obtain the position by having sex with Mrs. Louder, a practice he repeats several times after being dumped by his wife. He loses his job on the board shortly after receiving the promotion, but continues his secret relationship with Mrs. Louder. He also ends up in jail for selling drugs, but is released and continues his job at the department store. After leaving Winfred-Louder, he set up a reasonably successful dating service which later expanded into a television chat show.
* Gerald Hawthorne Bell (Kevin Pollak) – Drew&#x27;s boss for the show&#x27;s first season. Mr. Bell only appeared in person for his last appearance. He gets caught having relations with a woman in his office, and he and Mrs. Louder have to talk it out. When he appears, he is wearing a Santa costume. We only heard his voice on Drew&#x27;s speakerphone, despite the fact that Drew had his desk very close to Bell&#x27;s office. Little was known about him, but he behaved in a sexist and unprofessional manner, including liaisons with at least one female staffer. In the last episode of the first season, Mr. Bell finally appeared on camera as he was seen leaving his office after getting fired from the store. The running joke of his never being officially seen until this moment is referenced in dialogue when he says; &quot;What&#x27;s the matter, Carey? You act like you&#x27;ve never seen me before!&quot;
* Fran Louder (Nan Martin) – Mrs. Louder is one of the executives&#x27; &quot;cougars&quot; and partial namesake of the Winfred-Louder corporation who originally inherited the store from her dead husband. She is the CEO of the company that owns the department store, and retains her position even after the corporation is bought out by a larger company located in Amsterdam. As the head of the store, she thinks very little of Drew, and openly expresses surprise at the assertion that he still has dreams of becoming more successful, Mrs. Louder occasionally gives him minor promotions throughout the series, but his personality clashes with her ruthless and businesslike nature. She is somewhat sex-obsessed and conducts a long affair with the boorish, lazy, and obnoxious Larry Almada, played by Ian Gomez. (In another episode we learn Almada is superendowed sexually.) Mrs. Louder is last seen accompanying Mimi and Steve on their honeymoon (she advises them that she is a voyeur but they are forced to take her with them, anyway). She is removed from power shortly after when a member of the board improvises a speech slurring ethnic groups and gays. The insulted employees begin to riot, gaining the attention of the bosses in Amsterdam, who replace the entire board of directors except, for some reason, Mr. Wick.
* Robert Soulard (Mark Curry) – One of Drew&#x27;s bosses at Winfred-Louder, Mr. Soulard was appointed by the Dutch as Mrs. Louder&#x27;s replacement after the latter was fired along with the original board of directors. Slightly more open-minded than his predecessor, Mr. Soulard agrees to listen to the employees after he is made the new boss, and quickly appoints Drew to be the new Store Manager when Mr. Wick&#x27;s incompetence gets him sent to Toledo for retraining.
* Beulah Carey (Marion Ross) – Drew&#x27;s and Steve&#x27;s mother, married to George Carey (Stanley Anderson). George Carey dies towards the end of the series&#x27; run, although not due to the death of the actor.
* Kim Harvey (Adrienne Barbeau) – Oswald&#x27;s mother, who wears tight clothes and sweaters with plunging necklines. Her sexiness caused the young Drew in his childhood to commit some embarrassing faux pas.
* King Augustus Antonio Carey (Dakota and Ryan Williams and Matthew Josten ) – Gus is Steve and Mimi&#x27;s son as well as Drew&#x27;s nephew, who saved Mimi from being fired by Drew in the episode &quot;Drew Pops Something On Kate&quot;. Just as Drew is about to fire Mimi, he kicks while in the womb for the first time, causing him to feel compassion for Mimi and preventing him from firing her. Gus was born while Drew was in a coma, and his spirit (voiced by Jon Polito) met Drew up in Heaven before being born. After hearing Drew make jokes about how horrible Mimi was, Gus was afraid to be born. Drew convinced him that Mimi would be a good mother by going back down to Earth and spending time in the baby&#x27;s body. Drew told this story to the others after coming out of his coma, but nobody believed him. Gus was an infant for most of his time on the show, but received an age boost (putting him somewhere between 5 and 6 years old) for the final season (played by Matthew Josten). He burns down his house, initially thought to be with a wood-burning kit that Drew gives him as a gift. Since Mimi and Gus had nowhere to live, Drew offers his home to them, and they stay there almost until the end of the show. It was later discovered that Gus was a pyromaniac and intentionally started a fire in the house.
* Lisa Robbins (Katy Selverstone) – Drew&#x27;s girlfriend from season one, she is prevented from dating him as the rules at Winfred-Louder do not allow management to participate in romantic relationships with their employees. Although this initially forces them to hide their relationship in public, they eventually find a way to overcome this obstacle. She vies for a job as the head of the personal shopper department to become a member of the store&#x27;s management, prompting a competition with fellow applicants Kate and Mimi. Lisa begins dating Drew after she gets the job, but after a failed attempt to live together they agree to break up. She leaves her dog, Speedy, behind to stay with him and departs for good after her marriage in the second season.
* Lord Mercer (Jim Piddock) – An extremely wealthy Englishman, who bought Winfred-Louder and became the new owner after the Dutch divested themselves of the company/store(s). He also brings back Mr. Wick, saying only Englishmen know how to run a business: despite this, he once put his teenybopper daughter Milan (Jessica Cauffiel) in charge of Winfred-Lauder.
* Christine Watson (Wanda Sykes) – Hired to replace Nigel Wick as manager in season 7, falls in love with Drew.
* Jay Clemens (Robert Torti) – Kate&#x27;s handsome boyfriend from season one.
* Evan (Kyle Howard) – Co-owner of Never Ending Store with his brother, Scott (of the two bosses, he is regarded as the &#x27;nice&#x27; one). He is a Zen-seeking Buddhist who promotes peace and support, although he himself has a life coach, sees a family therapist with his brother, and takes anti-anxiety pills. He has a tenuous relationship with Scott because they spend so much time together.
* Scott (Jonathan Mangum) – Co-owner of Never Ending Store with his brother, Evan. He is more business-minded than Evan, and can get very irritated by Evan&#x27;s peace-seeking way of life. He teaches computer classes during the summer.
* Mrs. Wick (Richard Chamberlain) – Nigel Wick&#x27;s &quot;Mum&quot; Maggie, played by Chamberlain in drag. The character is clearly promiscuous, young Nigel having grown up with a series of &quot;uncles&quot; in and out of his life.
* Chuck (Kelly Perine) – Security Guard/Head of Security at Winfred-Louder. Chuck is a fellow employee at Winfred-Louder who seems to have a friendly relationship with Drew, as he, in his first appearance in the episode &quot;No Two Things Are Exactly Alike&quot; in Season 1, he tips Drew to the person who complained about a fellow employee who became offended at a sexually offensive cartoon which he put on a memo in the hopes of boosting company morale. In Chuck&#x27;s final appearance in the Season 5 episode &quot;Drew and the Racial Tension Play&quot;, Chuck is among the many minority employees who become offended at the socially insensitive comments of senior company board member Arthur Crawford (Hansford Rowe) who try to solicit Drew to get Crawford to apologize for his comments or resign.

<doc id="988707" wikidata="Q2090950" url="?curid=988707" title="Byzantine music">
<text>Byzantine music () originally consisted of the songs and hymns composed for the courtly and religious ceremonial of the Byzantine Empire and continued, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, in the traditions of the sung Byzantine chant of Eastern Orthodox liturgy. The ecclesiastical forms of Byzantine music are the best known forms today, because different Orthodox traditions still identify with the heritage of Byzantine music, when their cantors sing monodic chant out of the traditional chant books such as the Sticherarion, which in fact consisted of five books, and the Irmologion.

Byzantine music did not disappear after the fall of Constantinople. Its traditions continued under the Patriarch of Constantinople, who after the Ottoman conquest in 1453 was granted administrative responsibilities over all Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. During the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, burgeoning splinter nations in the Balkans declared autonomy or autocephaly from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The new self-declared patriarchates were independent nations defined by their religion.

In this context, Christian religious chant practiced in the Ottoman Empire, in, among other nations, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece, was based on the historical roots of the art tracing back to the Byzantine Empire, while the music of the Patriarchate created during the Ottoman period was often regarded as &quot;post-Byzantine.&quot; This explains why Byzantine music refers to several Orthodox Christian chant traditions of the Mediterranean and of the Caucasus practiced in recent history and even today, and this article cannot be limited to the music culture of the Byzantine past.

The Byzantine chant was added by UNESCO in 2019 to its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage &quot;as a living art that has existed for almost 2,000 years, the Byzantine chant is a significant cultural tradition and comprehensive music system forming part of the common musical traditions that developed in the Byzantine Empire.&quot;

== Imperial age ==
The tradition of eastern liturgical chant, encompassing the Greek-speaking world, developed even before the establishment of the new Roman capital, Constantinople, in 330 until its fall in 1453. Byzantine music was influenced by Hellenistic music traditions, classic Greek music as well as religious music traditions of Syriac and Hebrew cultures. The Byzantine system of octoechos, in which melodies were classified into eight modes, is specifically thought to have been exported from Syria, where it was known in the 6th century, before its legendary creation by Arab monk John of Damascus of the Umayyad Caliphate.

The term Byzantine music is sometimes associated with the medieval sacred chant of Christian Churches following the Constantinopolitan Rite. There is also an identification of &quot;Byzantine music&quot; with &quot;Eastern Christian liturgical chant&quot;, which is due to certain monastic reforms, such as the Octoechos reform of the Quinisext Council (692) and the later reforms of the Stoudios Monastery under its abbots Sabas and Theodore. The triodion created during the reform of Theodore was also soon translated into Slavonic, which required also the adaption of melodic models to the prosody of the language. Later, after the Patriarchate and Court had returned to Constantinople in 1261, the former cathedral rite was not continued, but replaced by a mixed rite, which used the Byzantine Round notation to integrate the former notations of the former chant books (Papadike). This notation had developed within the book sticherarion created by the Stoudios Monastery, but it was used for the books of the cathedral rites written in a period after the fourth crusade, when the cathedral rite was already abandoned at Constantinople. It is being discussed that in the Narthex of the Hagia Sophia an organ was placed for use in secular processions of the Emperor&#x27;s entourage.

=== The earliest sources and the tonal system of Byzantine music ===

According to the chant manual &quot;Hagiopolites&quot; of 16 church tones (echoi), the author of this treatise introduces a tonal system of 10 echoi. Nevertheless, both schools have in common a set of 4 octaves (&#x27;, and &#x27;), each of them had a &#x27; (authentic mode) with the finalis on the degree V of the mode, and a &#x27; (plagal mode) with the final note on the degree I. According to Latin theory, the resulting eight tones (octoechos) had been identified with the seven modes (octave species) and tropes (tropoi which meant the transposition of these modes). The names of the tropes like &quot;Dorian&quot; etc. had been also used in Greek chant manuals, but the names Lydian and Phrygian for the octaves of and had been sometimes exchanged. The Ancient Greek &quot;harmonikai&quot; was a Hellenist reception of the Pythagorean education programme defined as mathemata (&quot;exercises&quot;). Harmonikai was one of them. Today, chanters of the Christian Orthodox churches identify with the heritage of Byzantine music whose earliest composers are remembered by name since the 5th century. Compositions had been related to them, but they must be reconstructed by notated sources which date centuries later. The melodic neume notation of Byzantine music developed late since the 10th century, with the exception of an earlier ekphonetic notation, interpunction signs used in lectionaries, but modal signatures for the eight echoi can already be found in fragments (papyri) of monastic hymn books (tropologia) dating back to the 6th century.

Amid the rise of Christian civilization within Hellenism, many concepts of knowledge and education survived during the imperial age, when Christianity became the official religion. The Pythagorean sect and music as part of the four &quot;cyclical exercises&quot; (ἐγκύκλια μαθήματα) that preceded the Latin quadrivium and science today based on mathematics, established mainly among Greeks in southern Italy (at Taranto and Crotone). Greek anachoretes of the early Middle Ages did still follow this education. The Calabrian Cassiodorus founded Vivarium where he translated Greek texts (science, theology and the Bible), and John of Damascus who learnt Greek from a Calabrian monk Kosmas, a slave in the household of his privileged father at Damascus, mentioned mathematics as part of the speculative philosophy.
According to him philosophy was divided into theory (theology, physics, mathematics) and practice (ethics, economy, politics), and the Pythagorean heritage was part of the former, while only the ethic effects of music were relevant in practice. The mathematic science &quot;harmonics&quot; was usually not mixed with the concrete topics of a chant manual.

Nevertheless, Byzantine music is modal and entirely dependent on the Ancient Greek concept of harmonics. Its tonal system is based on a synthesis with ancient Greek models, but we have no sources left that explain to us how this synthesis was done. Carolingian cantors could mix the science of harmonics with a discussion of church tones, named after the ethnic names of the octave species and their transposition tropes, because they invented their own octoechos on the basis of the Byzantine one. But they made no use of earlier Pythagorean concepts that had been fundamental for Byzantine music, including:

It is not evident by the sources, when exactly the position of the minor or half tone moved between the and . It seems that the fixed degrees (hestotes) became part of a new concept of the echos as melodic mode (not simply octave species), after the echoi had been called by the ethnic names of the tropes.

=== Instruments within the Byzantine Empire ===
The 9th century Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the &quot;urghun&quot; (organ), &quot;shilyani&quot; (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the &quot;salandj&quot; (probably a bagpipe).

The first of these, the early bowed stringed instrument known as the Byzantine lyra, would come to be called the &quot;lira da braccio&quot;, in Venice, where it is considered by many to have been the predecessor of the contemporary violin, which later flourished there. The bowed &quot;lyra&quot; is still played in former Byzantine regions, where it is known as the Politiki lyra (lit. &quot;lyra of the City&quot; i.e. Constantinople) in Greece, the Calabrian lira in Southern Italy, and the Lijerica in Dalmatia.

The second instrument, the Hydraulis, originated in the Hellenistic world and was used in the Hippodrome in Constantinople during races. A pipe organ with &quot;great leaden pipes&quot; was sent by the emperor Constantine V to Pepin the Short King of the Franks in 757. Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning its establishment in Western church music. Despite this, the Byzantines never used pipe organs and kept the flute-sounding Hydraulis until the Fourth Crusade.

The final Byzantine instrument, the aulos, was a double-reeded woodwind like the modern oboe or Armenian duduk. Other forms include the &quot;plagiaulos&quot; (πλαγίαυλος, from πλάγιος, &quot;plagios&quot; &quot;sideways&quot;), which resembled the flute, and the &quot;askaulos&quot; (ἀσκαυλός from ἀσκός &quot;askos&quot; &quot;wine-skin&quot;), a bagpipe. These bagpipes, also known as &quot;Dankiyo&quot; (from ancient Greek: To angeion (Τὸ ἀγγεῖον) &quot;the container&quot;), had been played even in Roman times. Dio Chrysostom wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (tibia, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek aulos) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit. The bagpipes continued to be played throughout the empire&#x27;s former realms down to the present. (See Balkan Gaida, Greek Tsampouna, Pontic Tulum, Cretan Askomandoura, Armenian Parkapzuk, Zurna and Romanian Cimpoi.)

Other commonly used instruments used in Byzantine Music include the Kanonaki, Oud, Laouto, Santouri, Toubeleki, Tambouras, Defi Tambourine, Çifteli (which was known as Tamburica in Byzantine times), Lyre, Kithara, Psaltery, Saz, Floghera, Pithkiavli, Kavali, Seistron, Epigonion (the ancestor of the Santouri), Varviton (the ancestor of the Oud and a variation of the Kithara), Crotala, Bowed Tambouras (similar to Byzantine Lyra), Šargija, Monochord, Sambuca, Rhoptron, Koudounia, perhaps the Lavta and other instruments used before the 4th Crusade that are no longer played today. These instruments are unknown at this time.

In 2021, archaeologists discovered a flute with six holes dated back to the 4th and 5th centuries AD, in the Zerzevan Castle.

=== Acclamations at the court and the ceremonial book ===
Secular music existed and accompanied every aspect of life in the empire, including dramatic productions, pantomime, ballets, banquets, political and pagan festivals, Olympic games, and all ceremonies of the imperial court. It was, however, regarded with contempt, and was frequently denounced as profane and lascivious by some Church Fathers.

Another genre that lies between liturgical chant and court ceremonial are the so-called polychronia (πολυχρονία) and acclamations (ἀκτολογία). The acclamations were sung to announce the entrance of the Emperor during representative receptions at the court, into the hippodrome or into the cathedral. They can be different from the polychronia, ritual prayers or ektenies for present political rulers and are usually answered by a choir with formulas such as &quot;Lord protect&quot; (κύριε σῶσον) or &quot;Lord have mercy on us/them&quot; (κύριε ἐλέησον). The documented polychronia in books of the cathedral rite allow a geographical and a chronological classification of the manuscript and they are still used during ektenies of the divine liturgies of national Orthodox ceremonies today. The hippodrome was used for a traditional feast called Lupercalia (15 February), and on this occasion the following acclamation was celebrated:
The main source about court ceremonies is an incomplete compilation in a 10th-century manuscript that organised parts of a treatise Περὶ τῆς Βασιλείου Τάξεως (&quot;On imperial ceremonies&quot;) ascribed to Emperor Constantine VII, but in fact compiled by different authors who contributed with additional ceremonies of their period. In its incomplete form chapter 1–37 of book I describe processions and ceremonies on religious festivals (many lesser ones, but especially great feasts such as the Elevation of the Cross, Christmas, Theophany, Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Easter and Ascension Day and feasts of saints including St Demetrius, St Basil etc. often extended over many days), while chapter 38–83 describe secular ceremonies or rites of passage such as coronations, weddings, births, funerals, or the celebration of war triumphs. For the celebration of Theophany the protocol begins to mention several stichera and their echoi (ch. 3) and who had to sing them:
These protocols gave rules for imperial progresses to and from certain churches at Constantinople and the imperial palace, with fixed stations and rules for ritual actions and acclamations from specified participants (the text of acclamations and processional troparia or kontakia, but also heirmoi are mentioned), among them also ministers, senate members, leaders of the &quot;Blues&quot; (Venetoi) and the &quot;Greens&quot; (Prasinoi)—chariot teams during the hippodrome&#x27;s horse races. They had an important role during court ceremonies. The following chapters (84–95) are taken from a 6th-century manual by Peter the Patrician. They rather describe administrative ceremonies such as the appointment of certain functionaries (ch. 84,85), investitures of certain offices (86), the reception of ambassadors and the proclamation of the Western Emperor (87,88), the reception of Persian ambassadors (89,90), Anagorevseis of certain Emperors (91–96), the appointment of the senate&#x27;s &quot;proedros&quot; (97). The &quot;palace order&quot; did not only prescribe the way of movements (symbolic or real) including on foot, mounted, by boat, but also the costumes of the celebrants and who has to perform certain acclamations. The emperor often plays the role of Christ and the imperial palace is chosen for religious rituals, so that the ceremonial book brings the sacred and the profane together. Book II seems to be less normative and was obviously not compiled from older sources like book I, which often mentioned outdated imperial offices and ceremonies, it rather describes particular ceremonies as they had been celebrated during particular imperial receptions during the Macedonian renaissance.

=== The Desert Fathers and urban monasticism ===
Two concepts must be understood to appreciate fully the function of music in Byzantine worship and they were related to a new form of urban monasticism, which even formed the representative cathedral rites of the imperial ages, which had to baptise many catechumens.

The first, which retained currency in Greek theological and mystical speculation until the dissolution of the empire, was the belief in the angelic transmission of sacred chant: the assumption that the early Church united men in the prayer of the angelic choirs. It was partly based on the Hebrew fundament of Christian worship, but in the particular reception of St. Basil of Caesarea&#x27;s divine liturgy. John Chrysostom, since 397 Archbishop of Constantinople, abridged the long formula of Basil&#x27;s divine liturgy for the local cathedral rite.

The notion of angelic chant is certainly older than the Apocalypse account (Revelation 4:8–11), for the musical function of angels as conceived in the Old Testament is brought out clearly by Isaiah (6:1–4) and Ezekiel (3:12). Most significant in the fact, outlined in Exodus 25, that the pattern for the earthly worship of Israel was derived from heaven. The allusion is perpetuated in the writings of the early Fathers, such as Clement of Rome, Justin Martyr, Ignatius of Antioch, Athenagoras of Athens, John Chrysostom and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. It receives acknowledgement later in the liturgical treatises of Nicolas Kavasilas and Symeon of Thessaloniki.

The second, less permanent, concept was that of koinonia or &quot;communion&quot;. This was less permanent because, after the fourth century, when it was analyzed and integrated into a theological system, the bond and &quot;oneness&quot; that united the clergy and the faithful in liturgical worship was less potent. It is, however, one of the key ideas for understanding a number of realities for which we now have different names. With regard to musical performance, this concept of koinonia may be applied to the primitive use of the word choros. It referred, not to a separate group within the congregation entrusted with musical responsibilities, but to the congregation as a whole. St. Ignatius wrote to the Church in Ephesus in the following way:
You must every man of you join in a choir so that being harmonious and in concord and taking the keynote of God in unison, you may sing with one voice through Jesus Christ to the Father, so that He may hear you and through your good deeds recognize that you are parts of His Son.

A marked feature of liturgical ceremony was the active part taken by the people in its performance, particularly in the recitation or chanting of hymns, responses and psalms. The terms choros, koinonia and ekklesia were used synonymously in the early Byzantine Church. In Psalms 149 and 150, the Septuagint translated the Hebrew word &quot;machol&quot; (dance) by the Greek word &quot;choros&quot; . As a result, the early Church borrowed this word from classical antiquity as a designation for the congregation, at worship and in song in heaven and on earth both.

Concerning the practice of psalm recitation, the recitation by a congregation of educated chanters is already testified by the soloistic recitation of abridged psalms by the end of the 4th century. Later it was called prokeimenon. Hence, there was an early practice of simple psalmody, which was used for the recitation of canticles and the psalter, and usually Byzantine psalters have the 15 canticles in an appendix, but the simple psalmody itself was not notated before the 13th century, in dialogue or &quot;papadikai&quot; treatises preceding the book sticheraria. Later books, like the &quot;akolouthiai&quot; and some &quot;psaltika&quot;, also contain the elaborated psalmody, when a protopsaltes recited just one or two psalm verses. Between the recited psalms and canticles troparia were recited according to the same more or less elaborated psalmody. This context relates antiphonal chant genres including antiphona (kind of introits), trisagion and its substitutes, prokeimenon, allelouiarion, the later cherubikon and its substitutes, the koinonikon cycles as they were created during the 9th century. In most of the cases they were simply troparia and their repetitions or segments were given by the antiphonon, whether it was sung or not, its three sections of the psalmodic recitation were separated by the troparion.

==== The recitation of the biblical odes ====
The fashion in all cathedral rites of the Mediterranean was a new emphasis on the psalter. In older ceremonies before Christianity became the religion of empires, the recitation of the biblical odes (mainly taken from the Old Testament) was much more important. They did not disappear in certain cathedral rites such as the Milanese and the Constantinopolitan rite.

Before long, however, a clericalizing tendency soon began to manifest itself in linguistic usage, particularly after the Council of Laodicea, whose fifteenth Canon permitted only the canonical &quot;psaltai&quot;, &quot;chanters:&quot;, to sing at the services. The word choros came to refer to the special priestly function in the liturgy – just as, architecturally speaking, the choir became a reserved area near the sanctuary—and choros eventually became the equivalent of the word kleros (the pulpits of two or even five choirs).

The nine canticles or odes according to the psalter were:

* (1) The Song of the sea (Exodus 15:1–19);
* (2) The Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32:1–43);
* (3) – (6) The prayers of Hannah, Habakkuk, Isaiah, Jonah (1 Kings [1 Samuel] 2:1–10; Habakkuk 3:1–19; Isaiah 26:9–20; Jonah 2:3–10);
* (7) – (8) The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children (Apoc. Daniel 3:26–56 and 3:57–88);
* (9) The Magnificat and the Benedictus (Luke 1:46–55 and 68–79).

and in Constantinople they were combined in pairs against this canonical order:

* Ps. 17 with troparia Ἀλληλούϊα and Μνήσθητί μου, κύριε.
* (1) with troparion Tῷ κυρίῳ αἴσωμεν, ἐνδόξως γὰρ δεδόξασται.
* (2) with troparion Δόξα σοι, ὁ θεός. (Deut. 32:1–14) Φύλαξόν με, κύριε. (Deut. 32:15–21) Δίκαιος εἶ, κύριε, (Deut. 32:22–38) Δόξα σοι, δόξα σοι. (Deut. 32:39–43) Εἰσάκουσόν μου, κύριε. (3)
* (4) &amp; (6) with troparion Οἰκτείρησόν με, κύριε.
* (3) &amp; (9a) with troparion Ἐλέησόν με, κύριε.
* (5) &amp; Mannaseh (apokr. 2 Chr 33) with troparion Ἰλάσθητί μοι, κύριε.
* (7) which has a refrain in itself.

==== The troparion ====
The common term for a short hymn of one stanza, or one of a series of stanzas, is troparion. As a refrain interpolated between psalm verses it had the same function as the antiphon in Western plainchant. The simplest troparion was probably &quot;allelouia&quot;, and similar to troparia like the trisagion or the cherubikon or the koinonika a lot of troparia became a chant genre of their own.

A famous example, whose existence is attested as early as the 4th century, is the Easter Vespers hymn, &quot;Phos Hilaron&quot; (&quot;O Resplendent Light&quot;). Perhaps the earliest set of troparia of known authorship are those of the monk Auxentios (first half of the 5th century), attested in his biography but not preserved in any later Byzantine order of service. Another, &quot;O Monogenes Yios&quot; (&quot;Only Begotten Son&quot;), ascribed to the emperor Justinian I (527–565), followed the doxology of the second antiphonon at the beginning of the Divine Liturgy.

=== Romanos the Melodist, the kontakion, and the Hagia Sophia ===

The development of large scale hymnographic forms begins in the fifth century with the rise of the kontakion, a long and elaborate metrical sermon, reputedly of Syriac origin, which finds its acme in the work of St. Romanos the Melodist (6th century). This dramatic homily which could treat various subjects, theological and hagiographical ones as well as imperial propaganda, comprises some 20 to 30 stanzas (oikoi &quot;houses&quot;) and was sung in a rather simple style with emphasise on the understanding of the recent texts. The earliest notated versions in Slavic &quot;kondakar&#x27;s&quot; (12th century) and Greek &quot;kontakaria-psaltika&quot; (13th century), however, are in a more elaborate style (also rubrified idiomela), and were probably sung since the ninth century, when &quot;kontakia&quot; were reduced to the &quot;prooimion&quot; (introductory verse) and first &quot;oikos&quot; (stanza). Romanos&#x27; own recitation of all the numerous &quot;oikoi&quot; must have been much simpler, but the most interesting question of the genre are the different functions that &quot;kontakia&quot; once had. Romanos&#x27; original melodies were not delivered by notated sources dating back to the 6th century, the earliest notated source is the Tipografsky Ustav written about 1100. Its gestic notation was different from Middle Byzantine notation used in Italian and Athonite Kontakaria of the 13th century, where the gestic signs (cheironomiai) became integrated as &quot;great signs&quot;. During the period of psaltic art (14th and 15th centuries), the interest of kalophonic elaboration was focussed on one particular kontakion which was still celebrated: the Akathist hymn. An exception was John Kladas who contributed also with kalophonic settings of other kontakia of the repertoire.

Some of them had a clear liturgical assignation, others not, so that they can only be understood from the background of the later book of ceremonies. Some of Romanos creations can be even regarded as political propaganda in connection with the new and very fast reconstruction of the famous Hagia Sophia by Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. A quarter of Constantinople had been burnt down during a civil war. Justinian had ordered a massacre at the hippodrome, because his imperial antagonists who were affiliated to the former dynasty, had been organised as a chariot team. Thus, he had place for the creation of a huge park with a new cathedral in it, which was larger than any church built before as Hagia Sophia. He needed a kind of mass propaganda to justify the imperial violence against the public. In the kontakion &quot;On earthquakes and conflagration&quot; (H. 54), Romanos interpreted the Nika riot as a divine punishment, which followed in 532 earlier ones including earthquakes (526–529) and a famine (530):
According to Johannes Koder the kontakion was celebrated the first time during Lenten period in 537, about ten months before the official inauguration of the new built Hagia Sophia on 27 December.
=== Changes in architecture and liturgy, and the introduction of the cherubikon ===

During the second half of the sixth century, there was a change in Byzantine sacred architecture, because the altar used for the preparation of the eucharist had been removed from the bema. It was placed in a separated room called &quot;prothesis&quot; (πρόθεσις). The separation of the prothesis where the bread was consecrated during a separated service called proskomide, required a procession of the gifts at the beginning of the second eucharist part of the divine liturgy. The troparion &quot;Οἱ τὰ χερουβεὶμ&quot;, which was sung during the procession, was often ascribed to Emperor Justin II, but the changes in sacred architecture were definitely traced back to his time by archaeologists. Concerning the Hagia Sophia, which was constructed earlier, the procession was obviously within the church. It seems that the cherubikon was a prototype of the Western chant genre offertory.

With this change came also the dramaturgy of the three doors in a choir screen before the bema (sanctuary). They were closed and opened during the ceremony. Outside Constantinople these choir or icon screens of marble were later replaced by iconostaseis. Antonin, a Russian monk and pilgrim of Novgorod, described the procession of choirs during Orthros and the divine liturgy, when he visited Constantinople in December 1200:
When they sing Lauds at Hagia Sophia, they sing first in the narthex before the royal doors; then they enter to sing in the middle of the church; then the gates of Paradise are opened and they sing a third time before the altar. On Sundays and feastdays the Patriarch assists at Lauds and at the Liturgy; at this time he blesses the singers from gallery, and ceasing to sing, they proclaim the polychronia; then they begin to sing again as harmoniously and as sweetly as the angels, and they sing in this fashion until the Liturgy. After Lauds they put off their vestments and go out to receive the blessing of the Patriarch; then the preliminary lessons are read in the ambo; when these are over the Liturgy begins, and at the end of the service the chief priest recites the so-called prayer of the ambo within the sanctuary while the second priest recites in the church, beyond the ambo; when they have finished the prayer, both bless the people. Vespers are said in the same fashion, beginning at an early hour.

=== Monastic reforms in Constantinople and Jerusalem ===
By the end of the seventh century with the reform of 692, the kontakion, Romanos&#x27; genre was overshadowed by a certain monastic type of homiletic hymn, the canon and its prominent role it played within the cathedral rite of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Essentially, the canon, as it is known since 8th century, is a hymnodic complex composed of nine odes that were originally related, at least in content, to the nine Biblical canticles and to which they were related by means of corresponding poetic allusion or textual quotation (see the section about the biblical odes). Out of the custom of canticle recitation, monastic reformers at Constantinople, Jerusalem and Mount Sinai developed a new homiletic genre whose verses in the complex ode meter were composed over a melodic model: the heirmos.

During the 7th century kanons at the Patriarchate of Jerusalem still consisted of the two or three odes throughout the year cycle, and often combined different echoi. The form common today of nine or eight odes was introduced by composers within the school of Andrew of Crete at Mar Saba. The nine &quot;odes&quot; of the &quot;kanon&quot; were dissimilar by their metrum. Consequently, an entire &quot;heirmos&quot; comprises nine independent melodies (eight, because the second &quot;ode&quot; was often omitted outside Lenten period), which are united musically by the same echos and its melos, and sometimes even textually by references to the general theme of the liturgical occasion—especially in &quot;aposticha&quot; (ἀpόστιχα) composed over a given &quot;heirmos&quot;, but dedicated to a particular day of the menaion. Until the 11th century, the common book of hymns was the tropologion and it had no other musical notation than a modal signature and combined different hymn genres like troparion, sticheron, and canon.

The earliest tropologion was already composed by Severus of Antioch, Paul of Edessa and Ioannes Psaltes at the Patriarchate of Antioch between 512 and 518. Their tropologion has only survived in Syriac translation and revised by Jacob of Edessa. The tropologion was continued by Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, but especially by Andrew of Crete&#x27;s contemporary Germanus I, Patriarch of Constantinople who represented as a gifted hymnographer not only an own school, but he became also very eager to realise the purpose of this reform since 705, although its authority was questioned by iconoclast antagonists and only established in 787. After the octoechos reform of the Quinisext Council in 692, monks at Mar Saba continued the hymn project under Andrew&#x27;s instruction, especially by his most gifted followers John of Damascus and Cosmas of Jerusalem. These various layers of the Hagiopolitan tropologion since the 5th century have mainly survived in a Georgian type of tropologion called &quot;Iadgari&quot; whose oldest copies can be dated back to the 9th century.

Today the second ode is usually omitted (while the great kanon attributed to John of Damascus includes it), but medieval heirmologia rather testify the custom, that the extremely strict spirit of Moses&#x27; last prayer was especially recited during Lenten tide, when the number of odes was limited to three odes (triodion), especially patriarch Germanus I contributed with many own compositions of the second ode. According to Alexandra Nikiforova only two of 64 canons composed by Germanus I are present in the current print editions, but manuscripts have transmitted his hymnographic heritage.

== The monastic reform of the Stoudites and their notated chant books ==

During the 9th-century reforms of the Stoudios Monastery, the reformers favoured Hagiopolitan composers and customs in their new notated chant books heirmologion and sticherarion, but they also added substantial parts to the tropologion and re-organised the cycle of movable and immovable feasts (especially Lent, the , and its scriptural lessons). The trend is testified by a 9th-century tropologion of the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery which is dominated by contributions of Jerusalem. Festal stichera, accompanying both the fixed psalms at the beginning and end of Hesperinos and the psalmody of the Orthros (the Ainoi) in the Morning Office, exist for all special days of the year, the Sundays and weekdays of Lent, and for the recurrent cycle of eight weeks in the order of the modes beginning with Easter. Their melodies were originally preserved in the &quot;tropologion&quot;. During the 10th century two new notated chant books were created at the Stoudios Monastery, which were supposed to replace the tropologion: 
# the &quot;sticherarion&quot;, consisting of the idiomela in the &quot;menaion&quot; (the immoveable cycle between September and August), the &quot;triodion&quot; and the &quot;pentekostarion&quot; (the moveable cycle around the holy week), and the short version of &quot;octoechos&quot; (hymns of the Sunday cycle starting with Saturday evening) which sometimes contained a limited number of model troparia (prosomoia). A rather bulky volume called &quot;great octoechos&quot; or &quot;parakletike&quot; with the weekly cycle appeared first in the middle of the tenth century as a book of its own.
# the &quot;heirmologion&quot;, which was composed in eight parts for the eight echoi, and further on either according to the canons in liturgical order (KaO) or according to the nine odes of the canon as a subdivision into 9 parts (OdO).

These books were not only provided with musical notation, with respect to the former &quot;tropologia&quot; they were also considerably more elaborated and varied as a collection of various local traditions. In practice it meant that only a small part of the repertory was really chosen to be sung during the divine services. Nevertheless, the form &quot;tropologion&quot; was used until the 12th century, and many later books which combined octoechos, sticherarion and heirmologion, rather derive from it (especially the usually unnotated Slavonic &quot;osmoglasnik&quot; which was often divided in two parts called &quot;pettoglasnik&quot;, one for the kyrioi, another for the plagioi echoi). 

The old custom can be studied on the basis of the 9th-century tropologion ΜΓ 56+5 from Sinai which was still organised according to the old tropologion beginning with the Christmas and Epiphany cycle (not with 1 September) and without any separation of the movable cycle. The new Studite or post-Studite custom established by the reformers was that each ode consists of an initial troparion, the heirmos, followed by three, four or more troparia from the menaion, which are the exact metrical reproductions of the heirmos (aposticha), thereby allowing the same music to fit all troparia equally well. The combination of Constantinopolitan and Palestine customs must be also understood on the base of the political history.

Especially the first generation around Theodore Studites and Joseph the Confessor, and the second around Joseph the Hymnographer suffered from the first and the second crisis of iconoclasm. The community around Theodore could revive monastic life at the abandoned Stoudios Monastery, but he had to leave Constantinople frequently in order to escape political persecution. During this period, the Patriarchates of Jerusalem and Alexandria (especially Sinai) remained centres of the hymnographic reform. Concerning the Old Byzantine notation, Constantinople and the area between Jerusalem and Sinai can be clearly distinguished. The earliest notation used for the books &quot;sticherarion&quot; and was theta notation, but it was soon replaced by palimpsests with more detailed forms between Coislin (Palestine) and Chartres notation (Constantinople). Although it was correct that the Studites in Constantinople established a new mixed rite, its customs remained different from those of the other Patriarchates which were located outside the Empire.

On the other hand, Constantinople as well as other parts of the Empire like Italy encouraged also privileged women to found female monastic communities and certain hegumeniai also contributed to the hymnographic reform. The basic repertoire of the newly created cycles the immovable menaion, the movable triodion and pentekostarion and the week cycle of parakletike and Orthros cycle of the eleven stichera heothina and their lessons are the result of a redaction of the tropologion which started with the generation of Theodore the Studite and ended during the Macedonian Renaissance under the emperors Leo VI (the stichera heothina are traditionally ascribed to him) and Constantine VII (the exaposteilaria anastasima are ascribed to him).

=== The cyclic organization of lectionaries ===
Another project of the Studites&#x27; reform was the organisation of the New Testament (Epistle, Gospel) reading cycles, especially its hymns during the period of the triodion (between the pre-Lenten Meatfare Sunday called &quot;Apokreo&quot; and the Holy Week). Older lectionaries had been often completed by the addition of ekphonetic notation and of reading marks which indicate the readers where to start (ἀρχή) and to finish (τέλος) on a certain day. The Studites also created a typikon—a monastic one which regulated the cœnobitic life of the Stoudios Monastery and granted its autonomy in resistance against iconoclast Emperors, but they had also an ambitious liturgical programme. They imported Hagiopolitan customs (of Jerusalem) like the Great Vesper, especially for the movable cycle between Lent and All Saints (triodion and pentekostarion), including a Sunday of Orthodoxy which celebrated the triumph over iconoclasm on the first Sunday of Lent. 

Unlike the current Orthodox custom Old Testament readings were particular important during Orthros and Hesperinos in Constantinople since the 5th century, while there was no one during the divine liturgy. The Great Vespers according to Studite and post-Studite custom (reserved for just a few feasts like the Sunday of Orthodoxy) were quite ambitious. The evening psalm 140 (kekragarion) was based on simple psalmody, but followed by florid coda of a soloist (monophonaris). A melismatic prokeimenon was sung by him from the ambo, it was followed by three antiphons (Ps 114–116) sung by the choirs, the third used the trisagion or the usual anti-trisagion as a refrain, and an Old Testament reading concluded the prokeimenon.

=== The Hagiopolites treatise ===

The earliest chant manual pretends right at the beginning that John of Damascus was its author. Its first edition was based on a more or less complete version in a 14th-century manuscript, but the treatise was probably created centuries earlier as part of the reform redaction of the tropologia by the end of the 8th century, after Irene&#x27;s Council of Nikaia had confirmed the octoechos reform of 692 in 787. It fits well to the later focus on Palestine authors in the new chant book heirmologion.

Concerning the octoechos, the Hagiopolitan system is characterised as a system of eight diatonic echoi with two additional phthorai (nenano and nana) which were used by John of Damascus and Cosmas, but not by Joseph the Confessor who obviously preferred the diatonic mele of and .

It also mentions an alternative system of the Asma (the cathedral rite was called ἀκολουθία ᾀσματική) that consisted of 4 , 4 , 4 , and 4 . It seems that until the time, when the Hagiopolites was written, the octoechos reform did not work out for the cathedral rite, because singers at the court and at the Patriarchate still used a tonal system of 16 echoi, which was obviously part of the particular notation of their books: the asmatikon and the kontakarion or psaltikon.

But neither any 9th-century Constantinopolitan chant book nor an introducing treatise that explains the fore-mentioned system of the Asma, have survived. Only a 14th-century manuscript of Kastoria testifies cheironomic signs used in these books, which are transcribed in longer melodic phrases by the notation of the contemporary sticherarion, the middle Byzantine Round notation.
=== The transformation of the kontakion ===
The former genre and glory of Romanos&#x27; kontakion was not abandoned by the reformers, even contemporary poets in a monastic context continued to compose new liturgical kontakia (mainly for the menaion), it likely preserved a modality different from Hagiopolitan oktoechos hymnography of the sticherarion and the heirmologion.

But only a limited number of melodies or kontakion mele had survived. Some of them were rarely used to compose new kontakia, other kontakia which became the model for eight prosomoia called &quot;kontakia anastasima&quot; according to the oktoechos, had been frequently used. The kontakion ὁ ὑψωθεῖς ἐν τῷ σταυρῷ for the feast of cross exaltation (14 September) was not the one chosen for the prosomoion of the kontakion anastasimon in the same echos, it was actually the kontakion ἐπεφάνης σήμερον for Theophany (6 January). But nevertheless, it represented the second important melos of the which was frequently chosen to compose new kontakia, either for the (introduction) or for the (the stanzas of the kontakion called &quot;houses&quot;). Usually these models were not rubrified as &quot;avtomela&quot;, but as idiomela which means that the modal structure of a kontakion was more complex, similar to a sticheron idiomelon changing through different echoi.

This new monastic type of kontakarion can be found in the collection of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on the peninsula of Sinai (ET-MSsc Ms. Gr. 925–927) and its kontakia had only a reduced number of oikoi. The earliest kontakarion (ET-MSsc Ms. Gr. 925) dating to the 10th century might serve as an example. The manuscript was rubrified Κονδακάριον σῦν Θεῷ by the scribe, the rest is not easy to decipher since the first page was exposed to all kinds of abrasion, but it is obvious that this book is a collection of short kontakia organised according to the new menaion cycle like a sticherarion, beginning with 1 September and the feast of Symeon the Stylite. It has no notation, instead the date is indicated and the genre κονδάκιον is followed by the dedicated Saint and the incipit of the model kontakion (not even with an indication of its echos by a modal signature in this case).

Folio 2 verso shows a kontakion ἐν ἱερεῦσιν εὐσεβῶς διαπρέψας which was composed over the prooimion used for the kontakion for cross exaltation ὁ ὑψωθεῖς ἐν τῷ σταυρῷ. The prooimion is followed by three stanzas called oikoi, but they all share with the prooimion the same refrain called &quot;ephymnion&quot; (ἐφύμνιον) ταὶς σαῖς πρεσβεῖαις which concludes each &quot;oikos&quot;. But the model for these oikoi was not taken from the same kontakion, but from the other kontakion for Theophany whose first oikos had the incipit τῇ γαλιλαίᾳ τῶν ἐθνῶν.

== The Slavic reception ==

The Slavic reception is crucial for the understanding, how the kontakion has changed under the influence of the Stoudites. During the 9th and 10th centuries new Empires established in the North which were dominated by Slavic populations - Great Moravia and the Kievan Rus&#x27; (a federation of East Slavic tribes ruled by Varangians between the Black Sea and Scandinavia). The Byzantines had plans to participate actively in the
Christianization of those new Slavic powers, but those intentions failed. The well established and recently Christianized (864) Bulgarian Empire created two new literary centres at Preslav and Ohrid. These empires requested a state religion, legal codexes, the translation of canonic scriptures, but also the translation of an overregional liturgy as it was created by the Stoudios Monastery, Mar Saba and Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery. The Slavic reception confirmed this new trend, but also showed a detailed interest for the cathedral rite of the Hagia Sophia and the pre-Stoudite organisation of the tropologion. Thus, these manuscripts are not only the earliest literary evidence of Slavonic languages which offer a transcription of the local variants of Slavonic languages, but also the earliest sources of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite with musical notation, although transcribed into a notation of its own, just based on one tone system and on the contemporary layer of 11th-century notation, the roughly diastematic Old Byzantine notation.

=== The literary schools of the first Bulgarian empire ===

Unfortunately, no Slavonic tropologion written in Glagolitic script by Cyril and Methodius has survived. This lack of evidence does not prove that it had not existed, since certain conflicts with Benedictines and other Slavonic missionaries in Great Moravia and Pannonia were obviously about an Orthodox rite translated into Old Church Slavonic and practised already by Methodius and Clement of Ohrid. Only few early Glagolitic sources have been left. The Kiev Missal proves a West Roman influence in the Old Slavonic liturgy for certain territories of Croatia. A later 11th-century New Testament lectionary known as the Codex Assemanius was created by the Ohrid Literary School. A euchologion (ET-MSsc Ms. Slav. 37) was in part compiled for Great Moravia by Cyril, Clement, Naum and Constantine of Preslav. It was probably copied at Preslav about the same time. The aprakos lectionary proves that the Stoudites typikon was obeyed concerning the organisation of reading cycles. It explains, why Svetlana Kujumdžieva assumed that the &quot;church order&quot; mentioned in Methodius&#x27; vita meant the mixed Constantinopolitan Sabbaite rite established by the Stoudites. But a later finding by the same author pointed to another direction. In a recent publication she chose &quot;Iliya&#x27;s book&quot; (RUS-Mda Fond 381, Ms. 131) as the earliest example of an Old Church Slavonic tropologion (around 1100), it has compositions by Cyril of Jerusalem and agrees about 50% with the earliest tropologion of Sinai (ET-MSsc Ms. NE/MΓ 56+5) and it is likewise organised as a mеnaion (beginning with September like the Stoudites), but it still includes the movable cycle. Hence, its organisation is still close to the tropologion and it has compositions not only ascribed to Cosmas and John, but also Stephen the Sabaite, Theophanes the Branded, the Georgian scribe and hymnographer Basil at Mar Saba and Joseph the Hymnographer. Further on, musical notation has been added on some pages which reveal an exchange between Slavic literary schools and scribes of Sinai or Mar Saba: 
* theta (&quot;θ&quot; for &quot;thema&quot; which indicates a melodic figure over certain syllables of the text) or &quot;fita&quot; notation was used to indicate the melodic structure of an idiomelon/samoglasen in glas 2 &quot;Na yeerdanĭstěi rěcě&quot; (Theophany, f.109r). It was also used on other pages (kanon for hypapante, ff.118v-199r &amp; 123r),
* two forms of znamennaya notation, an earlier one has dots on the right sight of certain signs (the kanon &quot;Obrazę drevle Moisi&quot; in glas 8 for Cross elevation on 14 September, ff.8r-9r), and a more developed form which was obviously needed for a new translation of the text (&quot;another&quot; avtomelon/samopodoben, ино, glas 6 &quot;Odesnuǫ sŭpasa&quot; for Saint Christina of Tyre, 24 July, f.143r). 

Kujumdžieva pointed later at a Southern Slavic origin (also based on linguistic arguments since 2015), although feasts of local saints, celebrated on the same day as Christina Boris and Gleb, had been added. If its reception of a pre-Stoudite tropologion was of Southern Slavic origin, there is evidence that this manuscript was copied and adapted for a use in Northern Slavic territories. The adaption to the menaion of the Rus rather proves that notation was only used in a few parts, where a new translation of a certain text required a new melodic composition which was no longer included within the existing system of melodies established by the Stoudites and their followers. But there is a coincidence between the early fragment from the Berlin-collection, where the ἀλλὸ rubric is followed by a modal signature and some early neumes, while the elaborated zamennaya is used for a new sticheron (ино) dedicated to Saint Christina.

Recent systematic editions of the 12th-century notated mineya (like RUS-Mim Ms. Sin. 162 with just about 300 folios for the month December) which included not just samoglasni (idiomela) even podobni (prosomoia) and aposticha with notation (while the kondaks were left without notation), have revealed that the philosophy of the literary schools in Ohrid and Preslav did only require in exceptional cases the use of notation. The reason is that their translation of Greek hymnography were not very literal, but often quite far from the content of the original texts, the main concern of this school was the recomposition or troping of the given system of melodies (with their models known as avtomela and heirmoi) which was left intact. The Novgorod project of re-translation during the 12th century tried to come closer to the meaning of the texts and the notation was needed to control the changes within the system of melodies.

=== Znamennaya notation in the stichirar and the irmolog ===
Concerning the Slavic rite celebrated in various parts of the Kievan Rus&#x27;, there was not only an interest for the organisation of monastic chant and the &quot;tropologion&quot; and the &quot;oktoich&quot; or &quot;osmoglasnik&quot; which included chant of the &quot;irmolog&quot;, podobni (prosomoia) and their models (samopodobni), but also the samoglasni (idiomela) like in case of Iliya&#x27;s book.

Since the 12th century, there are also Slavic stichirars which did not only include the samoglasni, but also the podobni provided with &quot;znamennaya&quot; notation. A comparison of the very first samoglasen наста въходъ лѣтоу (&quot;Enter the entrance of the annual cycle&quot;) in glas 1 (ἐπέστη ἡ εἴσοδος τoῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ echos protos, SAV 1) of the mineya shows, that the znamennaya version is much closer to &quot;fita&quot; (theta) notation, since the letter &quot;θ =&quot; corresponds to other signs in Coislin and a synthetic way to write a kratema group in Middle Byzantine notation. It was obviously an elaboration of the simpler version written in Coislin:

The Middle Byzantine version allows to recognise the exact steps (intervals) between the neumes. They are here described according to the Papadic practice of solfège called &quot;parallage&quot; (παραλλαγή) which is based on echemata: for ascending steps always &quot;kyrioi echoi&quot; are indicated, for descending steps always echemata of the &quot;plagioi echoi&quot;. If the phonic steps of the neumes were recognised according to this method, the resulting solfège was called &quot;metrophonia&quot;. The step between the first neumes at the beginning passed through the protos pentachord between kyrios (a as transcription for α&#x27;) and plagios phthongos (D as transcription of πλα&#x27;): a—Da—a—G—a—G—FGa—a—EF—G—a—acbabcba. The Coislin version seems to end (ἐνιαυτοῦ) thus: EF—G—a—Gba (the klasma indicates that the following kolon continues immediately in the music). In znamennaya notation the combination dyo apostrophoi (dve zapĕtiye) and oxeia (strela) at the beginning (наста) is called &quot;strela gromnaya&quot; and obviously derived from the combination &quot;apeso exo&quot; in Coislin notation. According to the customs of Old Byzantine notation, &quot;apeso exo&quot; was not yet written with &quot;spirits&quot; called &quot;chamile&quot; (down) or &quot;hypsile&quot; (up) which did later specify as pnevmata the interval of a fifth (four steps). As usual the Old Church Slavonic translation of the text deals with less syllables than the Greek verse. The neumes only show the basic structure which was memorised as &quot;metrophonia&quot; by the use of &quot;parallage&quot;, not the &quot;melos&quot; of the performance. The &quot;melos&quot; depended on various methods to sing an idiomelon, either together with a choir or to ask a soloist to create a rather individual version (changes between soloist and choir were at least common for the period of the 14th century, when the Middle Byzantine sticherarion in this example was created). But the comparison clearly reveals the potential (δύναμις) of the rather complex genre idiomelon.

=== The Kievan Rus&#x27; and the earliest manuscripts of the cathedral rite ===
The background of Antonin&#x27;s interest in celebrations at the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, as they had been documented by his description of the ceremony around Christmas and Theophany in 1200, were diplomatic exchanges between Novgorod and Constantinople.

==== Reception of the cathedral rite ====
In the Primary Chronicle it is reported, how a legacy of the Rus&#x27; was received in Constantinople and how they did talk about their experience in presence of Vladimir the Great in 987, before the Grand Prince Vladimir decided about the Christianization of the Kievan Rus&#x27; (Laurentian Codex written at Nizhny Novgorod in 1377):
There was obviously also an interest in the representative aspect of those ceremonies at the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople. Today, it is still documented by seven Slavic kondakar&#x27;s:
# Tipografsky Ustav: Moscow, State Tretyakov Gallery, Ms. K-5349 (about 1100)
# Two fragments of a kondakar&#x27; (one kondak with notation): Moscow, Russian State Library (RGB), Fond 205 Ms. 107 (12th century)
# Troitsky-Lavrsky Kondakar&#x27;: Moscow, Russian State Library (RGB), Fond 304 Ms. 23 (about 1200)
# Blagoveščensky Kondakar&#x27;: Saint Petersburg, National Library of Russia (RNB), Ms. Q.п.I.32 (about 1200)
# Uspensky Kondakar&#x27;: Moscow, State Historical Museum (GIM), Ms. Usp. 9-п (1207, probably for the Uspensky Sobor)
# Sinodal&#x27;ny Kondakar&#x27;: Moscow, State Historical Museum (GIM), Ms. Sin. 777 (early 13th century)
# South-Slavic kondakar&#x27; without notation: Moscow, State Historical Museum (GIM), part of the Book of Prologue at the Chludov collection (14th century)

Six of them had been written in scriptoria of Kievan Rus&#x27; during the 12th and the 13th centuries, while there is one later kondakar&#x27; without notation which was written in the Balkans during the 14th century. The aesthetic of the calligraphy and the notation has so developed over a span of 100 years that it must be regarded as a local tradition, but also one which provided us with the earliest evidence of the cheironomic signs which had only survived in one later Greek manuscript.

In October 1147, the chronicler Odo of Deuil described during the Second Crusade of King Louis VII the cheironomia, but also the presence of eunuchs during the cathedral rite. With respect to the custom of the Missa greca (for the patron of the Royal Abbey of Saint Denis where Odo lived as a monk), he reported that the Byzantine emperor sent his clerics to celebrate the divine liturgy for the Frankish visitors:

==== Kondakarian notation of the asmatikon part ====
The Kievan Rus&#x27; obviously cared about this tradition, but especially about the practice of cheironomia and its particular notation: the so-called &quot;kondakarian notation&quot;. A comparison with Easter koinonikon proves two things: the Slavic kondakar&#x27; did not correspond to the &quot;pure&quot; form of the Greek kontakarion which was the book of the soloist who had also to recite the larger parts of the kontakia or kondaks. It was rather a mixed form which included also the choir book (asmatikon), since there is no evidence that such an asmatikon had ever been used by clerics of the Rus&#x27;, while the kondakarian notation integrated the cheironomic signs with simple signs, a Byzantine convention which had only survived in one manuscript (GR-KA Ms. 8), and combined it with Old Slavic znamennaya notation, as it had been developed in the sticheraria and heirmologia of the 12th century and the so-called Tipografsky Ustav.

Although the common knowledge of znamennaya notation is as limited as the one of other Old Byzantine variants such as Coislin and Chartres notation, a comparison with the asmatikon Kastoria 8 is a kind of bridge between the former concept of cheironomiai as the only authentic notation of the cathedral rite and the hand signs used by the choir leaders and the later concept of great signs integrated and transcribed into Middle Byzantine notation, but it is a pure form of the choir book, so that such comparison is only possible for an asmatic chant genre such as the koinonikon.

See for instance the comparison of the Easter koinonikon between the Slavic Blagoveščensky kondakar&#x27; which was written about 1200 in the Northern town Novgorod of the Rus&#x27;, its name derived from its preservation at the collection of the at Nizhny Novgorod.
The comparison should not suggest that both versions are identical, but the earlier source documents an earlier reception of the same tradition (since there is a difference about 120 years between both sources it is impossible to judge the differences). The rubric &quot;Glas 4&quot; is most likely an error of the notator and meant &quot;Glas 5&quot;, but it is also possible, that the Slavic tone system was already in such an early period organised in triphonia. Thus, it could also mean that анеане, undoubtedly the plagios protos enechema ἀνεανὲ, was supposed to be on a very high pitch (about an octave higher), in that case the has not the octave species of (a tetrachord up and a pentachord down), but the one of plagios protos. The comparison also shows very much likeness between the use of asmatic syllables such as &quot;оу&quot; written as one character such as &quot;ꙋ&quot;. Tatiana Shvets in her description of the notational style also mentions the &quot;kola&quot; (frequent interpunction within the text line) and medial intonations can appear within a word which was sometimes due to the different numbers of syllables within the translated Slavonic text. A comparison of the neumes also show many similarities to Old Byzantine (Coislin, Chartres) signs such as ison (stopica), apostrophos (zapĕtaya), oxeia (strela), vareia (palka), dyo kentemata (točki), diple (statĕya), klasma (čaška), the krusma (κροῦσμα) was actually an abbreviation for a sequence of signs (palka, čaška with statĕya, and točki) and omega &quot;ω&quot; meant a parakalesma, a great sign related to a descending step (see the echema for plagios protos: it is combined with a dyo apostrophoi called &quot;zapĕtaya&quot;).

==== A melismatic polyeleos passing through 8 echoi ====
Another very modern part of the Blagoveščensky kondakar&#x27; was a Polyeleos composition (a post-Stoudites custom, since they imported the Great Vesper from Jerusalem) about the psalm 135 which was divided into eight sections, each one in another glas:
* Glas 1: Ps. 135:1–4 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.107r).
* Glas 2: Ps. 135:5–8 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.107v).
* Glas 3: Ps. 135:9–12 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.108v).
* Glas 4: Ps. 135:13–16 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.109v).
* Glas 5: Ps. 135:17–20 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.110r).
* Glas 6: Ps. 135:21–22 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.110v).
* Glas 7: Ps. 135:23–24 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.112r).
* Glas 8: Ps. 135:25–26 (RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.п.I.32, f.113r).

The refrain алелɤгιа · алелɤгιа · ананҍанҍс · ꙗко въ вҍкы милость ѥго · алелɤгιа (&quot;Alleluia, alleluia. medial intonation For His love endureth forever. Alleluia.&quot;) was only written after a medial intonation for the conclusion of the first section. &quot;Ananeanes&quot; was the medial intonation of echos protos (glas 1). This part was obviously composed without modulating to the glas of the following section. The refrain was likely sung by the right choir after the intonation of its leader: the domestikos, the preceding psalm text probably by a soloist (monophonaris) from the ambo. Interesting is that only the choir sections are entirely provided with &quot;cheironomiai&quot;. Slavic cantors had been obviously trained in Constantinople to learn the hand signs which corresponded to the great signs in the first row of Kondakarian notation, while the monophonaris parts had them only at the end, so that they were probably indicated by the domestikos or lampadarios in order to get the attention of the choir singers, before singing the medial intonations.

We do not know, whether the whole psalm was sung or each section at another day (during the Easter week, for instance, when the glas changed daily), but the following section do not have a written out refrain as a conclusion, so that the first refrain of each section was likely repeated as conclusion, often with more than one medial intonation which indicated, that there was an alternation between the two choirs. For instance within the section of glas 3 (the modal signature was obviously forgotten by the notator), where the text of the refrain is almost treated like a &quot;nenanismaton&quot;: &quot;але-нь-н-на-нъ-ъ-на-а-нъ-ı-ъ-лɤ-гı-а&quot;. The following medial intonations &quot;ипе&quot; (εἴπε &quot;Say!&quot;) and &quot;пал&quot; (παλὶν &quot;Again!&quot;) obviously did imitate medial intonations of the &quot;asmatikon&quot; without a true understanding of their meaning, because a παλὶν did usually indicate that something will be repeated from the very beginning. Here one choir did obviously continue another one, often interrupting it within a word.

== The end of the cathedral rite in Constantinople ==
1207, when the Uspensky kondakar&#x27; was written, the traditional cathedral rite had no longer survived in Constantinople, because the court and the patriarchate had gone into exile to Nikaia in 1204, after Western crusaders had made it impossible to continue the local tradition. The Greek books of the asmatikon (choir book) and the other one for the monophonaris (the psaltikon which often included the kontakarion) were written outside Constantinople, on the island of Patmos, at Saint Catherine&#x27;s monastery, on the Holy Mount Athos and in Italy, in a new notation which developed some decades later within the books sticherarion and heirmologion: Middle Byzantine round notation. Thus, also the book kontakarion-psaltikon dedicated to the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite must be regarded as part of its reception history outside Constantinople like the Slavic kondakar&#x27;.

=== The kontakaria and asmatika written in Middle Byzantine round notation ===

The reason, why the psaltikon was called &quot;kontakarion&quot;, was that most parts of a kontakion (except of the refrain) were sung by a soloist from the ambo, and that the collection of the kontakarion had a prominent and dominant place within the book. The classical repertoire, especially the kontakion cycle of the movable feasts mainly attributed to Romanos, included usually about 60 notated kontakia which were obviously reduced to the prooimion and the first oikos and this truncated form is commonly regarded as a reason, why the notated form presented a melismatic elaboration of the kontakion as it was commonly celebrated during the cathedral rite at the Hagia Sophia. As such within the notated kontakarion-psaltikon the cycle of kontakia was combined with a prokeimenon and alleluiarion cycle as a proper chant of the divine liturgy, at least for more important feasts of the movable and immovable cycle. Since the Greek kontakarion has only survived with Middle Byzantine notation which developed outside Constantinople after the decline of the cathedral rite, the notators of these books must have integrated the cheironomiai or great signs still present in the Slavic kondakar&#x27;s within the musical notation of the new book sticherarion.

The typical composition of a kontakarion-psaltikon (τὸ ψαλτικὸν, τὸ κοντακάριον) was:
* prokeimena
* alleluiaria
* eight hypakoai anastasimai
* kontakarion with the movable cycle integrated in the menaion after hypapante
* eight kontakia anastasima
* appendix: refrains of the alleluiaria in octoechos order, rarely alleluia endings in psalmody, or usually later added kontakia

The choral sections had been collected in a second book for the choir which was called asmatikon (τὸ ᾀσματικὸν). It contained the refrains (dochai) of the prokeimena, troparia, sometimes the ephymnia of the kontakia and the hypakoai, but also ordinary chant of the divine liturgy like the eisodikon, the trisagion, the choir sections of the cherubikon asmatikon, the weekly and annual cycle of koinonika. There were also combined forms as a kind of asmatikon-psaltikon.

In Southern Italy, there were also mixed forms of psaltikon-asmatikon which preceded the Constantinopolitan book &quot;akolouthiai&quot;:
* annual cycle of proper chant in menaion order with integrated movable cycle (kontakion with first oikos, allelouiaria, prokeimenon, and koinonikon)
* all refrains of the asmatikon (allelouiarion, psalmodic allelouiaria for polyeleoi, dochai of prokeimena, trisagion, koinonika etc.) in oktoechos order
* appendix with additions

=== The kontakia collection in the Greek kontakaria-psaltika ===
Nevertheless, the Greek monastic as well as the Slavic reception within the Kievan Rus&#x27; show many coincidences within the repertoire, so that even kontakia created in the North for local customs could be easily recognised by a comparison of Slavonic kondakar&#x27;s with Greek psaltika-kontakaria. Constantin Floros&#x27; edition of the melismatic chant proved that the total repertoire of 750 kontakia (about two thirds composed since the 10th century) was based on a very limited number of classical melodies which served as model for numerous new compositions: he counted 42 prooimia with 14 prototypes which were used as a model for other kontakia, but not rubrified as avtomela, but as idiomela (28 of them remained more or less unique), and 13 oikoi which were separately used for the recitation of oikoi. The most frequently used models also generated a prosomoion-cycle of eight kontakia anastasima. The repertoire of these melodies (not so much their elaborated form) was obviously older and was transcribed by echemata in Middle Byzantine notation which were partly completely different from those used in the sticherarion. While the Hagiopolites mentioned 16 echoi of the cathedral rite (four kyrioi, four plagioi, four mesoi and four phthorai), the kontakia-idiomela alone represent at least 14 echoi (four in and represented as mesos forms, four , three additional and three ).

The integrative role of Middle Byzantine notation becomes visible that a lot of echemata were used which were not known from the sticherarion. Also the role of the two known as the chromatic νενανῶ and the enharmonic νανὰ was completely different from the one within the Hagiopolitan Octoechos, phthora nana clearly dominated (even in ), while phthora nenano was rarely used. Nothing is known about the exact division of the tetrachord, because no treatise concerned with the tradition the cathedral rite of Constantinople has survived, but the Coislin sign of &quot; (ξηρὸν κλάσμα) appeared on different pitch classes () than within the of the sticherarion.

The Slavic kondakar&#x27;s did only use very few oikoi pointing at certain models, but the text of the first oikos was only written in the earliest manuscript known as Tipografsky Ustav, but never provided with notation. If there was an oral tradition, it probably did not survive until the 13th century, because the oikoi are simply missing in the kondakar&#x27;s of that period.

One example for an kondak-prosomoion whose music can be only reconstructed by a comparison with model of the kontakion as it has been notated into Middle Byzantine round notation, is Аще и убьѥна быста which was composed for the feast for Boris and Gleb (24 July) over the kondak-idiomelon Аще и въ гробъ for Easter in : 

The two Middle Byzantine versions in the kontakarion-psaltikon of Paris and the one of Sinai are not identical. The first kolon ends on different &quot;: either on (C, if the melos starts there) or one step lower on the , the called &quot;grave echos&quot; (a kind of B flat). It is definitely exaggerated to pretend that one has &quot;deciphered&quot; Kondakarian notation, which is hardly true for any manuscript of this period. But even considering the difference of about at least 80 years which lie between the Old Byzantine version of Slavic scribes in Novgorod (second row of the kondakar&#x27;s) and the Middle Byzantine notation used by the monastic scribes of the later Greek manuscripts, it seems obvious that all three manuscripts in comparison did mean one and the same cultural heritage associated with the cathedral rite of the Hagia Sophia: the melismatic elaboration of the truncated kontakion. Both Slavonic kondaks follow strictly the melismatic structure in the music and the frequent segmentation by kola (which does not exist in the Middle Byzantine version), interrupting the conclusion of the first text unit by an own kolon using with the asmatic syllable &quot;ɤ&quot;.

Concerning the two martyre princes of the Kievan Rus&#x27; Boris and Gleb, there are two kondak-prosomoia dedicated to them in the Blagoveščensky Kondakar&#x27; on the folios 52r–53v: the second is the prosomoion over the kondak-idiomelon for Easter in glas 8, the first the prosomoion Въси дьньсь made over the kondak-idiomelon for Christmas Дева дньсь (Ἡ παρθένος σήμερον) in glas 3. Unlike the Christmas kontakion in glas 3, the Easter kontakion was not chosen as model for the kontakion anastasimon of glas 8 (). It had two other important rivals: the kontakion-idiomelon Ὡς ἀπαρχάς τῆς φύσεως (ꙗко начатъкы родоу) for All Saints, although an enaphonon () which begins on the lower fourth (), and the prooimion Τῇ ὑπερμάχῳ στρατιγῷ (Възбраньноумоу воѥводѣ побѣдьнаꙗ) of the Akathistos hymn in (which only appears in Greek kontakaria-psaltika).

Even among the notated sources there was a distinction between the short and the long psaltikon style which was based on the musical setting of the kontakia, established by Christian Thodberg and by Jørgen Raasted. The latter chose Romanos&#x27; Christmas kontakion Ἡ παρθένος σήμερον to demonstrate the difference and his conclusion was that the known Slavic kondakar&#x27;s did rather belong to the long psaltikon style.

== The era of psaltic art and the new mixed rite of Constantinople ==

There was a discussion promoted by Christian Troelsgård that Middle Byzantine notation should not be distinguished from Late Byzantine notation. The argument was that the establishment of a mixed rite after the return of the court and the patriarchate from the exile in Nikaia in 1261, had nothing really innovative with respect the sign repertoire of Middle Byzantine notation. The innovation was probably already done outside Constantinople, in those monastic scriptoria whose scribes cared about the lost cathedral rite and did integrate different forms of Old Byzantine notation (those of the sticherarion and heirmologion like theta notation, Coislin and Chartres type as well as those of the Byzantine asmatikon and kontakarion which were based on cheironomies). The argument was mainly based on the astonishing continuity that a new a type of treatise revealed by its continuous presence from the 13th to the 19th centuries: the Papadike. In a critical edition of this huge corpus, Troelsgård together with Maria Alexandru discovered many different functions that this treatise type could have. It was originally an introduction for a revised type of sticherarion, but it also introduced many other books like mathemataria (literally &quot;a book of exercises&quot; like a sticherarion kalophonikon or a book with heirmoi kalophonikoi, stichera kalophonika, anagrammatismoi and kratemata), akolouthiai (from &quot;taxis ton akolouthion&quot; which meant &quot;order of services&quot;, a book which combined the choir book &quot;asmatikon&quot;, the book of the soloist &quot;kontakarion&quot;, and with the rubrics the instructions of the typikon) and the Ottoman anthologies of the Papadike which tried to continue the tradition of the notated book akolouthiai (usually introduced by a Papadike, a kekragarion/anastasimatarion, an anthology for Orthros, and an anthology for the divine liturgies).

With the end of creative poetical composition, Byzantine chant entered its final period, devoted largely to the production of more elaborate musical settings of the traditional repertoire: either embellishments of the earlier simpler melodies (palaia &quot;old&quot;), or original music in highly ornamental style (called &quot;kalophonic&quot;). This was the work of the so-called &quot;Maïstores&quot;, &quot;masters&quot;, of whom the most celebrated was St. John Koukouzeles (14th century) as a famous innovator in the development of chant. The multiplication of new settings and elaborations of the traditional repertoire continued in the centuries following the fall of Constantinople.

=== The revision of the chant books ===

One part of this process was the redaction and limitation of the present repertoire given by the notated chant books of the sticherarion (menaion, triodion, pentekostarion, and oktoechos) and the heirmologion during the 14th century. Philologists called this repertoire the &quot;standard abridged version&quot; and counted alone 750 stichera for the menaion-part, and 3300 odes of the heirmologion.

Chronological research of the books sticherarion and heirmologion did not only reveal an evolution of notation systems which were just invented for these chant books, they can be also studied with respect to the repertoire of heirmoi and of stichera idiomela. The earliest evolution of sticherarion and heirmologion notation was the explanation of the &quot;theta&quot; (Slav. &quot;fita&quot;), &quot;oxeia&quot; or &quot;diple&quot; which were simply set under a syllable, where a melisma was expected. These explanations were either written with Coislin (scriptoria of monasteries under administration of the Patriarchates Jerusalem and Alexandria) or with Chartres notation (scriptoria in Constantinople or on Mount Athos). Both notations went through different stages. Since the evolution of the Coislin system also aimed a reduction of signs in order to define the interval value by less signs in order to avoid a confusion with an earlier habit to use them, it was favoured in comparison with the more complex and stenographic Chartres notation by later scribes during the late 12th century. The standard round notation (also known as Middle Byzantine notation) combined signs of both Old Byzantine notation systems during the 13th century. Concerning the repertoire of unique compositions (stichera idiomela) and models of canon poetry (heirmoi), scribes increased their number between the 12th and 13th century. The Middle Byzantine redaction of the 14th century reduced this number within a standard repertoire and tried to unify the many variants, sometimes offering only a second variant notated in red ink. Since the 12th century also prosomoia (texts composed over well-known avtomela) had been increasingly written down with notation, so that a former local oral tradition to apply psalmody to the evening (Ps 140) and the Laud psalm (Ps 148) became finally visible in these books.

==== Heirmologion ====
The characteristic of these books is that their collection were over-regional. The probably oldest fully notated chant book is the heirmologion of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos (GR-AOml Ms. β 32) which has been written about the turn to the 11th century. With 312 folios it has much more canons than later redactions notated in Middle Byzantine notation. It was notated in archaic Chartres notation and was organised in canon order. Each canon within an echos section was numbered through and has detailed ascriptions concerning the feast and the author who was believed to have composed poetry and music of the heirmos: 
In exceptional cases, some of these canons were marked as prosomoia and written out with notation. In comparison, later heirmologia just notated the heirmoi with the text they were remembered (referred by an incipit), while the akrosticha composed over the model of the heirmos had been written in the text book menaion. Already the famous heirmologion of Paris, Ms. 220 of the fonds Coislin which gave the name to &quot;Coislin notation&quot; and written about 100 years later, seems to collect almost half the number of heirmoi. But within many heirmoi there are one or even two alternative versions (ἄλλος &quot;another one&quot;) inserted directly after certain odes, not just with different neumes, but also with different texts. It seems that several former heirmoi of the same author or written for the same occasion had been summarised under one heirmos and some of the odes of the canon could be replaced by others. But the heirmoi for one and the same feast offered the option to singers to choose between different schools (the Sabaite represented by Andrew, Cosmas and John &quot;the monk&quot; and his nephew Stephen, the Constantinopolitan represented by Patriarch Germanos, and the one of Jerusalem by George of Nicomedia and Elias), different echoi, and even different heirmoi of the same author.

Apart from this canonisation which can be observed in the process of redaction between the 12th and 14th centuries, one should also note that the table above compares two different redactions between the 11th and 12th centuries: the one of Constantinople and Athos (Chartres notation) and another one at the scriptoria of Jerusalem (especially the Patriarchate and the Monastery of Saint Sabbas) and Sinai within the Patriarchate of Alexandria written in Coislin notation. Within the medium of Middle Byzantine notation which combined signs stemming from both Old Byzantine notation systems, there was a later process of unification during the 14th century, which combined both redactions, a process which was preceded by the dominance of Coislin notation by the end of the 12th century, when the more complex Chartres notation came out of use, even at Constantinopolitan scriptoria.

=== Petros Bereketes and the school of the Phanariotes ===

To a certain degree there may be found remnants of Byzantine or early (Greek-speaking, Orthodox Christian) near eastern music in the music of the Ottoman Court. Examples such as that of the composer and theorist Prince Cantemir of Romania learning music from the Greek musician &quot;Angelos&quot;, indicate the continuing participation of Greek speaking people in court culture. The influences of ancient Greek basin and the Greek Christian chants in the Byzantine music as origin, are confirmed. Music of Turkey was influenced by Byzantine music, too (mainly in the years 1640–1712). Ottoman music is a synthesis, carrying the culture of Greek and Armenian Christian chant. It emerged as the result of a sharing process between the many civilizations that met together in the Orient, considering the breadth and length of duration of these empires and the great number of ethnicities and major or minor cultures that they encompassed or came in touch with at each stage of their development.

== The Orthodox reformulation according to the New Method ==

Chrysanthos of Madytos (c. 1770–1846), Gregory the Protopsaltes (c. 1778 – c. 1821), and Chourmouzios the Archivist were responsible for a reform of the notation of Greek ecclesiastical music. Essentially, this work consisted of a simplification of the Byzantine Musical Symbols that, by the early 19th century, had become so complex and technical that only highly skilled chanters were able to interpret them correctly. The work of the three reformers is a landmark in the history of Greek Church music, since it introduced the system of neo-Byzantine music upon which are based the present-day chants of the Greek Orthodox Church. Unfortunately, their work has since been misinterpreted often, and much of the oral tradition has been lost.

=== Konstantinos Byzantios&#x27; renunciation of the New Method ===

=== The old school of the patriarchate ===

=== The modern school of the patriarchate ===

=== Ison ===

The Ison (music) is a drone note, or a slow-moving lower vocal part, used in Byzantine chant and some related musical traditions to accompany the melody. It is assumed that the ison was first introduced in Byzantine practice in the 16th century.

=== Teretismata and nenanismata ===

The practice of Terirem is vocal improvisation with nonsense syllables. It can contain syllables like &quot;te ri rem&quot; or &quot;te ne na&quot;, sometimes enriched with some theological words. It is a custom for a choir, or an orthodox psalmist to start the chanting by finding the musical tone by singing at the very beginning a &quot;ne-ne&quot;.

== The Simon Karas school at Athens ==

Simon Karas (1905–1999) began an effort to assemble as much material as possible in order to restore the apparently lost tradition. His work was continued by his students Lycourgos Angelopoulos and Ioannis Arvanitis who both had a quite independent and different approach to the tradition.

=== Lycourgos Angelopoulos and the Greek-Byzantine choir ===

Lycourgos Angelopoulos died on 18 May 2014, but during his life-time he always perceived himself more as a student than a teacher, despite the great number of his students and followers and the great success he enjoyed as a teacher. He published some essays where he explained the role that his teacher Simon Karas had for his work. He studied the introduction of the New Method under the aspect which were the Middle Byzantine neumes that had been abandoned by Chrysanthos, when he introduced the New Method. In particular, he discussed the role of Petros Ephesios, the editor of the first print editions who still used the qualitative sign of &quot;oxeia&quot; which had been soon abandoned. In collaboration with Georgios Konstantinou who wrote a new manual and introduction for his school, Lycourgos Angelopoulos re-introduced certain aphonic signs and re-interpreted them as ornamental signs according to the definitive rhythmic interpretation of the New Method which had transcribed the melos into notation. Thus, he had to provide for the whole repertoire of the living tradition an own handwritten edition which had been printed for all his students. For the proper understanding, the new universal notation according to Chrysanthos could be used to transcribe any kind of Ottoman music, not only the church music composed according to the oktoechos melopœia, but also makam music and rural traditions of the Mediterranean. Thus, the whole ornamental aspect of monophonic music depended now on an oral tradition, but it was no longer represented by the aphonic or great signs which had to be understood from the traditional context rooting back to the Byzantine psaltic art. Therefore, the other fundament of Angelopoulos&#x27; school was the participating fieldwork of traditional protopsaltes, those of the archon protopsaltes of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (and many of them had been forced into exile since the Cyprus crisis of 1964), and Athonite singers, especially those recordings he made of Father Dionysios Firfiris.

Two major styles of interpretation have evolved, the Hagioritic, which is simpler and is mainly followed in monasteries, and the Patriarchal, as exemplified by the style taught at the Great Church of Constantinople, which is more elaborate and is practised in parish churches. Nowadays the Orthodox churches maintain chanting schools in which new cantors are trained. Each diocese employs a &quot;protopsaltes&quot; (&quot;first cantor&quot;), who directs the diocesan cathedral choir and supervises musical education and performance. The &quot;protopsaltes&quot; of the Patriarchates are given the title &quot;Archon Protopsaltes&quot; (&quot;Lord First Cantor&quot;), a title also conferred as an honorific to distinguished cantors and scholars of Byzantine music.

=== Ioannis Arvanitis ===

While Angelopoulos&#x27; school basically stuck to the transcriptions of Chourmouzios the Archivist who did transcribe as one of the great teachers also the Byzantine repertoire according to the New Method during the beginning of the 19th century, another student of Karas Ioannis Arvanitis developed an autonomous approach which allowed him to study the older sources written in Middle Byzantine notation.

Ioannis Arvanitis published his ideas in several essays and in a doctoral thesis. He founded several ensembles like Aghiopolitis which performed the tradition of the Byzantine cathedral rite based on his own study of medieval kontakaria and asmatika in Italy, or got involved in collaborations with other ensembles whose singers were instructed by him, such as Cappella Romana directed by Alexander Lingas, Ensemble Romeiko directed by Yorgos Bilalis or Vesna Sara Peno who studied with Ioannis Arvanitis, before the she founded an own Ensemble dedicated Saint Kassia and to the Old Church Slavonic repertoire according to the Serbian tradition of the Athonite Hilandar Monastery.

<text>Obeah, also spelled Obiya or Obia, is a broad term for African diasporic religious, spell-casting, and healing traditions found primarily in the former British colonies of the Caribbean. These practices derive much from West African traditions but also incorporate elements of European and South Asian origin. Many of those who practice these traditions avoid the term &quot;Obeah&quot; due to the word&#x27;s pejorative connotations in many Caribbean societies.

Central to Obeah are ritual specialists who offer a range of services to paying clients. These specialists have sometimes been termed Obeahmen and Obeahwomen, although often refer to themselves in other ways, for instance calling themselves &quot;scientists&quot;, &quot;doctors&quot;, or &quot;professors&quot;. Important in these ritual systems is engagement with the spirits and the manipulation of supernatural forces. A prominent role is played by healing practices, often incorporating herbal and animal ingredients. Other services include attempts to achieve justice for a client or to provide them with spiritual protection. Cursing practices have also featured in Obeah, involving the making of objects to cause harm or the production of poisons. There is considerable regional and individual variation in the nature of the rituals that practitioners of Obeah have engaged in.

Amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries, thousands of West Africans, many Ashanti were transported to Caribbean colonies controlled by the British Empire. Here, traditional African religious practices assumed new forms, for instance being employed for the protection of Maroon communities. Enslaved Africans also absorbed British influences, especially from Christianity, and later from the Hinduism and Islam introduced by indentured South Asian migrants. The colonial elites disapproved of African traditions and introduced laws to prohibit them, using the term &quot;Obeah&quot; as a general label for these practices from the 1760s on. This suppression meant that Obeah emerged as a system of practical rituals rather than as a broader communal religion akin to Haitian Vodou or Cuban Santería. After the British abolition of slavery in the 1830s, new laws were introduced against Obeah, increasingly portraying it as fraud, laws that remained following the end of imperial rule. Since the 1980s, Obeah&#x27;s practitioners have campaigned to remove these legal restrictions, often under the aegis of religious freedom.

The term &quot;Obeah&quot; has been used for practices in the Caribbean nations of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Virgin Islands. Caribbean migrants have also taken these practices elsewhere, to countries like the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. In many Caribbean countries Obeah remains technically illegal and widely denigrated, especially given the negative assessment towards it evident in religions like Evangelical Protestantism and Rastafari.

==Definitions and terminology==

Obeah incorporates both spell-casting and healing practices, largely of African origin, although with European and South Asian influences as well. It is found primarily in the former British colonies of the Caribbean, namely Suriname, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands, Trinidad, Tobago, Guyana, Belize, the Bahamas, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Aside from the common use of &quot;Obeah&quot;, other spellings that have been used include &quot;Obiya&quot;, &quot;Obey&quot;, &quot;Obi&quot;, and &quot;Obia&quot;, the latter common in Suriname and French Guiana. 

The term &quot;Obeah&quot; encompasses a varied range of traditions that are highly heterogenous and display much regional variation.
The Hispanic studies scholars Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert defined Obeah as &quot;a set of hybrid or creolized beliefs dependent on ritual invocation, fetishes, and charms&quot;, while the historian Diana Paton termed it &quot;a very wide range of practices that, broadly speaking, invoke the ritual manipulation of spiritual power&quot;. For the historians Jerome Handler and Kenneth Bilby it was &quot;a loosely defined complex involving supernatural practices largely related to healing and protection&quot;. The historian Thomas Waters called Obeah a &quot;supernatural tradition&quot;, and described how it &quot;blended West African rituals with herbalism, Islam, Christianity and even a smattering of British folk magic&quot;. The term was originally used by Europeans, according to Handler and Bilby, as &quot;a catch-all term for a range of supernatural-related ideas and behaviours that were not of European origin and which they heavily criticized and condemned.&quot;

Throughout history, the term &quot;Obeah&quot; has rarely been used as a self-description of a person&#x27;s own practices. In the Caribbean, practitioners of folk healing traditions are often reluctant to publicly describe what they do as Obeah; there are some people who will privately describe what they do as &quot;Obeah&quot;, but used other words publicly. Historically, those who were accused of practicing Obeah in criminal court rarely used that term itself. Some practitioners instead refer to it as &quot;Science&quot;, or as working, doing a job, doing some good, practicing, clearing. In Jamaica, another term for Obeah is &quot;iniquity,&quot; probably deriving from the repeated Protestant admonitions that Obeah was an iniquitous practice.

===Relations with other religious traditions===

Paton noted that, in encompassing a broad range of supernaturally-oriented practices, the term &quot;Obeah&quot; served a &quot;roughly equivalent&quot; role in the Anglophone Caribbean to the terms &quot;conjure&quot; and &quot;root work&quot; (or Hoodoo) in the United States and the &quot;Quimbois&quot; of Francophone Caribbean islands Guadeloupe and Martinique. Fernández Olmos and Paravisini-Gebert suggested that Quimbois was essentially &quot;a variation of Obeah&quot;. 
Obeah has both similarities and differences with other Afro-Caribbean religious traditions such as Haitian Vodou or Cuban Santería and Palo. Unlike them, it lacks communal rituals or a system of liturgy, and in contrast to the followers of these traditions, there is little evidence that Obeah&#x27;s practitioners have regarded it as &quot;their religion&quot;. Fernández Olmos and Paravisini-Gebert took the view that Obeah was not a religion per se, but is a term applied to &quot;any African-derived practice with religious elements&quot;. Obeah exists at the borders of what both Christians and social scientists have typically recognised as &quot;religion,&quot; and as such it has historically often been classified not as religion but as &quot;magic,&quot; &quot;witchcraft,&quot; &quot;superstition,&quot; or &quot;charlatanism.&quot;

Across much of the Caribbean it is common for individuals to practise multiple religious traditions simultaneously. Many practitioners of Obeah attend Christian church services and do not see their practice as being at odds with Christianity. In Trinidad, various Obeah practitioners are also involved in the Orisha religion. In parts of the West Indies, South Asian migration has resulted in syncretisms between Obeah and Hinduism. In places with large South Asian communities like Guyana and Trinidad there are records of some Obeahmen being brahmins who also served as Hindu priests.

===Etymology===

&quot;Obeah&quot; is often used as a general term for Afro-Caribbean religion as a whole. Bilby noted that in these cases it was &quot;a monolithic signifier for African or neo-African forms of religiosity or spirituality still existing in the Caribbean&quot;. However, throughout the Caribbean, there is &quot;considerable disagreement&quot; about the meaning of the term &quot;obeah&quot;; the term is malleable, and as Bilby notes, it has no &quot;single, essential meaning&quot;. It has instead often been used in reference to several different things.

It is not known exactly how and when the term &quot;obeah&quot; came to be used in the Anglophone Caribbean. The earliest unambiguous use of it in the region was in a letter from Barbados from 1710, where it appeared as &quot;Obia&quot;, and the term was more widely extant in Barbadian English by the 1720s and 1730s.
In contemporary scholarship, there is general agreement that the word &quot;obeah&quot; is of West African origin, although there remain different arguments as to which language it derives from. Paton noted that the exact origins of the term were &quot;unlikely to be definitively resolved&quot;. One argument is that it stems from Twi, one of the Akan languages. In this case, it may derive from &quot;obayifo&quot;, a Twi term generally translated as &quot;witch&quot;, or from &quot;bayi&quot;, the term for the morally neutral supernatural force employed by the &quot;obayifo&quot;. In support of this origin is the fact that the term &quot;obeah&quot; proved prominent in the British Caribbean colonies, Suriname, and the Danish Virgin Islands, all areas where large numbers of Akan speakers from the Gold Coast were introduced.

A second possibility is that the word &quot;obeah&quot; comes from the Efik language. If so, it could derive from the Efik word for &quot;doctor,&quot; or alternatively from the word &quot;ubio&quot;, often translated as &quot;fetish&quot;. A third option traces it to the Igbo language, where a &quot;dibia&quot; was a ritual specialist involved in healing and other practices. Other proposals trace the word &quot;obeah&quot; to the Edo language &quot;obi&quot;, often translated as &quot;poison&quot;, or the Yoruba language &quot;obi&quot;, a term for a type of divination. In support of these non-Akan origins is the fact that captives taken from the Bay of Biafra constituted a major part of the population in those parts of the Caribbean where the term &quot;obeah&quot; is earliest attested.

In many parts of the Caribbean, the word &quot;Obeah&quot; is reserved only for destructive ritual practices and regarded as a synonym for sorcery or witchcraft. 
In other places, the term is used in a fairly neutral manner to describe a form of spiritual power. This is the common understanding of the term among Maroon communities in Suriname and French Guiana, for example. Bilby noted that in this context, &quot;obeah&quot; was a concept akin to the Yoruba religious notion of &quot;aṣẹ&quot;, which is also found in Santería and Candomblé. He suggested that the positive use of the word &quot;obia&quot; here was because these Maroon communities had remained largely outside of European cultural domination. These Surinamese did believe in the negative use of supernatural power, but they called that &quot;wisi&quot;, a term derived from the English &quot;witch&quot;. 

Variants of the term &quot;Obeah&quot; also appeared among African-Americans in the South Carolina Lowcountry prior to the American Civil War.
The term &quot;obeah&quot; seems to have been unknown in Francophone societies during the 17th and 18th centuries, but began to appear among French speakers in Martinique by the early 19th century.

==Beliefs and practices==

During the period of enslavement, Obeah was primarily directed to goals that the enslaved people would have deemed beneficial, such as healing, locating missing property, protecting against illness and misfortune, and targeting the slave owners.
Obeah revolves around one-to-one consultations between practitioners and their clients. 
Common goals in Obeah include attracting a partner, finding lost objects, resolving legal issues, getting someone out of prison, attracting luck for gambling or games, and wreaking revenge.

===Spirits===
Central to Obeah is the relationship between humans and spirits. Unlike other Afro-Caribbean religious traditions, such as Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santería, Obeah does not strictly centre around deities who manifest through divination and the possession of their worshippers. These spirits and deities can be &quot;called&quot; or summoned to assist the Obeah practitioner but are not worshipped. These spiritual forces are often deemed essentially morally neutral.

In various Caribbean cultures, it is believed that a spirit can attack someone either on its own initiative or because it has been sent to do so by an Obeah practitioner.
In some contexts, the colour red is explained as countering the presence of duppies.

===Obeahmen and obeahwomen===

Obeahmen and obeahwomen are deemed able to bewitch and unwitch, heal, charm, tell fortunes, detect stolen goods, reveal unfaithful lovers, and command &quot;duppies&quot;. The historian Diana Paton referred to them as &quot;spiritual workers&quot; and &quot;ritual specialists&quot;. Obeah is practiced by both males and females, typically referred to as &quot;obeahmen&quot; and &quot;obeahwomen&quot; respectively. However, various practitioners avoid calling what they do &quot;obeah&quot;. In the Bahamas, commonly used terms for a practitioner is &quot;Bush man&quot; or &quot;bush doctor&quot;; in Jamaica an &quot;iniquity worker&quot;, and in Trinidad a common term is &quot;Wanga man&quot;. In Grenada they are sometimes called &quot;Scientists&quot;, and in Guyana as &quot;Professor&quot;, &quot;Madame&quot;, &quot;Pundit&quot;, &quot;Maraj&quot;, and &quot;work-man&quot;. Historical terms found in Jamaica include &quot;doctors,&quot; &quot;professors,&quot; &quot;one-eyed men,&quot; &quot;doctormen,&quot; &quot;do good men,&quot; or &quot;four eye men.&quot; Practitioners of Quimbois are referred to as &quot;quimboiseurs&quot;, &quot;sorciers&quot;, and &quot;gadé zaffés&quot;. A number of the favored terms, such as &quot;science-man,&quot; &quot;scientist,&quot; &quot;doctor-man&quot; and &quot;professor&quot;, emphasise modernity.

In Obeah tradition, it is typically believed that practitioners will be born with special powers; they are sometimes referred to as having been &quot;born with the gift&quot;. It is taught that possession of these powers may be revealed to the individual through dreams or visions in late childhood or early adolescence. In Caribbean lore, it is sometimes believed that an Obeah practitioner will bear a physical disability, such as a blind eye, a club foot, or a deformed hand, and that their powers are a compensation for this.

Being an Obeah practitioner is often believed to pass hereditarily from a parent to their eldest child. Alternatively, someone may become a practitioner following a traumatic event. Once they have decided to pursue the practice, a person typically becomes the apprentice of an established obeahman or woman. According to folk tradition, this apprenticeship should take place in the forest and last for a year, a notion that derives from older African ideas. In practice, apprenticeships can last up to five or six years.

A practitioner&#x27;s success in attracting clients is usually rooted in their reputation. 
Older obeahmen/women are usually regarded more highly than younger ones. They do not normally wear special clothing to mark out their identity. In many cases, they have practiced in secret, allowing them to operate even while their practices are illegal.
In Trinidad and Tobago, 21st-century Obeah practitioners often advertise their services in the classified advert columns of newspapers.

====Relationship with clients====

Clients will typically pay for the services of an Obeah practitioner, the size of the fee often being connected to the client&#x27;s means. This exchange of money for ritual services is long embedded. Part of this fee will be used to buy items necessary for the intended rituals, such as candles, rum, and fowl. There are a few examples of monetary payment being charged during the era of slavery. In an 1831 account from Jamaica, for instance, a slave named Polydore requested two dollars, a cock, and a pint of rum to heal a man he had made ill with his curse. Further evidence for the monetary nature of these transactions comes from the period after emancipation.

Among the Trinidadian cases regarding Obeah recorded from 1890 and 1930, the main reason clients approached a practitioner was work-related worries and aspirations; this was followed by attempts to deal with physical suffering, court cases, and relationship issues. Discussing the situation among Jamaicans and British Jamaicans in the 1970s, Venetia Newall noted that &quot;respectable middle-class people&quot; generally shunned Obeah but would sometimes turn to it during &quot;times of stress&quot;.

===Healing and herbalism===

Obeah is often used for protection rather than for harm.
The main social function of an Obeah practitioner is often as a herbalist. To assist with healing a client&#x27;s ailments, the obeahman/woman will often utilise baths, massages, and mixtures of various ingredients. &quot;Bush baths&quot; are often applied to relieve fevers and involve a range of different herbal ingredients placed within hot water. These often rely on a knowledge of the properties of various animal and herbal ingredients. 
Graveyard dirt may be employed to access the spirit world.

In Obeah traditions, plants are believed to absorb cosmic properties from the sun, moon, and planets.

At a 1755 trial in Martinique, there were reports of amulets incorporating incense, holy water, pieces of the Eucharist, wax from an Easter candle, and small crucifixes.

Obeah bottles are much like the witch bottles used in early modern and modern Britain.

In various cases, Obeah rituals are performed to try and affect the outcome of a court case. A Jamaican case recorded in 1911 for instance involved the ritual specialist turning a key in a padlock while saying the name of an individual they wanted to prevent speaking in court. Another element of lore, recorded in 1978, maintained that holding a nutmeg in one&#x27;s mouth while speaking on oath in court will help a person secure legal victory.

These religious practices can also be used in times of war. Various Maroons turned to them amid the Surinamese Interior War of the 1980s.
Obeah has also been used by organised crime. When London gangster Mark Lambie was put on trial for kidnap and torture in 2002, both his victims and fellow gang members suggested that his powers of Obeah had made him &quot;untouchable&quot;.

===Divination===
One recorded method of divination in Obeah entails placing a key inside a Bible, tying and binding the book to a thread, and then observing how the book turns while Psalm 50 is read. This is very similar to the Bible and key divination method used in Britain since at least the 17th century.
In Guyana, South Asians have added chiromancy or palm reading to the divination styles employed by Obeah practitioners.

===Harming and poisons===

In various cases, a sudden death has been attributed to a bad spirit being set upon the deceased through Obeah.
A common harming method in Obeah is spiking a person&#x27;s food. 
One recurring notion is that a woman can win a man from her love rival by placing her own menstrual fluid in his food. In the Caribbean, love spells such as this are often deemed immoral as they are intended to deny a person their free will.

One method of lifting an Obeah curse, recorded from the Caribbean, involved a person crossing themselves and stating: &quot;Bless the mark, and cross if off.&quot; Also reported in various 18th and early 19th-century sources was the notion that Christian baptism provided protection from Obeah.

A continuing source of anxiety related to Obeah was the belief that practitioners were skilled in using poisons, as mentioned in Matthew Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Journal of a West India Proprietor&quot;. Many Jamaicans accused women of such poisonings; one case Lewis discussed was that of a young woman named Minetta, who was brought to trial for attempting to poison her master. Lewis and others often characterized the women they accused of poisonings as being manipulated by obeahmen, who they contended actually provided the women with the materials for poisonings. 

They claimed that Obeah men stole people&#x27;s shadows, and they set themselves up as the helpers of those who wished to have their shadows restored. Revivalists contacted spirits to expose the evil works they ascribed to the Obeah men and led public parades, which resulted in crowd hysteria that engendered violent antagonism against them. The public &quot;discovery&quot; of buried Obeah charms, presumed to be of evil intent, led on more than one occasion to violence against the rival Obeah practitioners. Conflicts between supposedly &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; spiritual work could sometimes be found within plantation communities. In one 1821 case brought before court in Berbice, an enslaved woman named Madalon allegedly died as a result of being accused of malevolent obeah that caused the drivers at Op Hoop Van Beter plantation to fall ill. The man implicated in her death, a spiritual worker named Willem, conducted an illegal Minje Mama dance to divine the source of the Obeah, and after she was chosen as the suspect, she was tortured to death.

==History==

===Origins===

Obeah practices largely derive from Ashanti origins. The Ashanti and other Twi-speaking peoples from the Gold Coast formed the largest group of enslaved people in the British Caribbean colonies.
Obeah was first identified in the British colonies of the Caribbean during the 17th century.

Enslaved Africans who were transported to the Caribbean during the 17th or 18th centuries came from societies where spiritual power played a prominent role. Although there was considerable variation in the religious beliefs and practices of these African societies, all generally shared a belief that ancestors and spirits could act on the physical world and thus should be respected and cared for. All these African societies also had ritual specialists, individuals who engaged in divination and were deemed to have knowledge of powerful substances that could be used to either heal of harm other people. The West Europeans who oversaw Atlantic transportation also believed in an unseen world that could influence humanity, but typically divided it more strictly along ethical lines, adhering to a Christian belief in good forces aligned with God and evil forces aligned with the Devil. Early modern Europeans had also inherited the idea of the witch as a spiritually evil person. Paton noted that these European notions of witchcraft framed &quot;European understandings of African spiritual work and ritual specialists in the Caribbean&quot;.

In British colonial communities, aside from referring to the set of spiritual practices, &quot;Obeah&quot; also came to refer to a physical object, such as a talisman or charm, that was used for evil magical purposes. The item was referred to as an Obeah-item (e.g. an &#x27;obeah ring&#x27; or an &#x27;obeah-stick&#x27;, translated as: &quot;ring used for witchcraft&quot; or &quot;stick used for witchcraft&quot; respectively). Obeah incorporated various beliefs from the religions of later migrants to the colonies where it was present. Obeah also influenced other religions in the Caribbean, e.g. Christianity, which incorporated some Obeah beliefs.

===Growing legal proscription===
The notion that Obeah might be a force for generating solidarity among slaves and encouraging them to resist colonial domination was brought to the attention of European slave-owners due to several events in the 1730s. In Jamaica, the First Maroon War saw British forces fail to suppress the Jamaican Maroons, free Africans who employed spiritual protection as an important part of their fighting strategy. Obeah ritual specialists had played a prominent role within these Maroon communities; one of the best known was the Akan woman Nanny of the Maroons described as an old &#x27;witch&#x27; and a &#x27;Hagg&#x27; by English soldier Philip Thicknesse in his memoirs.
Colonial sources claimed she could quickly grow food for her starving forces, and to catch British bullets and either fire them back or attack the soldiers with a machete. Meanwhile, in Antigua in 1736, an alleged slave conspiracy to attack Europeans was exposed, its ringleaders arrested, and 47 people executed. Interrogations revealed that the conspirators engaged in religious ceremonies and offered religious oaths, in at least one case administered by an &quot;Obiaman&quot; named Quawcoo. According to this account, Quawcoo had also used divination to determine an auspicious time for the uprising. In various cases, Obeah rituals might encourage &quot;courage and morale&quot; during such rebellions.

Fearing that Obeah&#x27;s practitioners might incite anti-colonial rebellions, European colonial authorities increasingly saw Obeah as a threat to the stability on their plantations and criminalised it. In 1733, Governor Philip Gardelin issued a clause to the Danish West Indian slave code proscribing various ritual practices; rather than referring to this as &quot;Obeah&quot;, he used the word &quot;towernarye&quot;, probably derived from the Dutch word &quot;tovernery&quot;. It was in the aftermath of Tacky&#x27;s War, a rebellion against the colonial authorities, that the Jamaican Assembly first passed laws that banned Obeah in 1760. This law took the term &quot;Obeah&quot;, which was previously rarely used, and gave it a legal definition. During the rebellion, Tacky is said to have consulted an Obeahman who prepared for his forces a substance that would make them immune to bullets, which boosted their confidence in executing the rebellion. The European colonial fear of Afro-Caribbean traditions was furthered following the successful Haitian Revolution, in which various revolutionaries were allegedly practitioners of Vodou.

Early Jamaican laws against Obeah reflected Christian theological viewpoints, characterising it as &quot;pretending to have communication with the devil&quot; or &quot;assuming the art of witchcraft.&quot; Negative assessments, often reflecting racist attitudes, were also apparent in 18th century writings that discussed Obeah, such as Edward Long&#x27;s &quot;History of Jamaica&quot; (1774) and Bryan Edward&#x27;s &quot;History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies&quot; (1793), which also emphasised the notion that it was not religion but witchcraft or magic.
The practice of obeah with regards to healing led to the Jamaican 18th and 19th century traditions of &quot;doctresses&quot;, such as Grace Donne (who nursed her lover, Simon Taylor (sugar planter)), Sarah Adams, Cubah Cornwallis, Mary Seacole, and Mrs Grant (who was the mother of Mary Seacole). These doctresses practised the use of hygiene and the applications of herbs decades before they were adopted by European doctors and nurses.

As the British Empire expanded through the Caribbean during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, so the term &quot;obeah&quot; was diffused through these colonies.
This colonial suppression eradicated the African-derived communal rituals that involved song, dance, and offerings to spirits.
In the British Caribbean, communal rituals oriented towards deities only persevered in pockets, as with Obeah in Jamaica and Orisha in Trinidad. The historian Diana Paton has argued that the laws introduced to restrict African-derived practices contributed to the developing idea that these varied traditions could be seen as a singular phenomenon, Obeah.

Afro-Caribbeans often concealed Obeah from Europeans. There were nevertheless Europeans who believed in Obeah&#x27;s power; there are records of some plantation owners getting Obeah practitioners to cast spells over their fields to deter thieves.

===Post-emancipation===

After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834, Europeans in the West Indies continued to be troubled by the influence of Obeah within Afro-Caribbean communities. Existing laws against Obeah had typically applied only to enslaved people and so new laws to proscribe the practice were required. Between 1838 and 1920 a new raft of measures against Obeah and related practices appeared throughout the Caribbean. In Jamaica, for example, new legal proscriptions against Obeah, which was to punished with hard labour and the lash, came in 1856. 

These new laws largely downgraded the severity with which Obeah was punished but also expanded the scope of what would be considered part of it; as Forde noted, Obeah became &quot;an extremely inclusive and amorphous criminal category&quot;. In some cases authorities also prohibited the publication or circulation of written material pertaining to Obeah. Several of these laws, including those in Trinidad and Tobago, British Guiana, Barbados, and Jamaica, emphasised the idea that Obeah would be regarded as fraud. This contributed to the notion of Obeah practitioners as fraudsters and charlatans that became dominant among European-Caribbean elites. This approach was influenced by ongoing efforts in Britain to suppress fortune tellers and astrologers there; such prosecutions were thought to weed out &quot;superstition&quot; and thus seen as part of the empire&#x27;s civilising mission.

The trials of those prosecuted reveal that in this period, clients were typically approaching Obeah specialists for assistance with health, employment, luck, or success in business or legal entanglements. In various cases the police used entrapment to arrest practitioners of Obeah. There is also evidence that the prosecutions were often assisted by those outside the police; according to recorded Jamaican cases, at least half of arrests for Obeah practice resulted from co-operation with non-police. These individuals may have felt cheated by the Obeah specialist, believing that the latter failed to deliver as promised or had overcharged them, and so turned them into the police. The accused repeatedly defended themselves by maintaining that what they practised did not constitute Obeah. In some cases, such as that of Montserrat-based Charles &quot;Tishum&quot; Dolly, who was convicted five times, the prosecutions served to provide them with greater publicity for their services.

The work of police and other state officials often provided much of the evidence used by early scholars of Obeah. An exhibition of material obtained from convicted Obeah practitioners was for instance included at the Jamaica International Exhibition in Kingston in 1891. This material was used as a partial basis for May Robinson&#x27;s 1893 article on Obeah in &quot;Folk-Lore&quot;, which in turn influenced the research of Martha Beckwith and Joseph Williams in Jamaica in the 1920s.

Hundreds of thousands of South Asians, and a smaller number of Chinese, arrived in the Caribbean largely as indentured laborers. They brought with them their own religions which also fed into Obeah.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there is evidence that many Obeah practitioners had travelled between different Caribbean islands.
Given certain similarities between Obeah and the Cuban religion of Palo, it is possible that Obeah practices were introduced to adherents of the latter system amid Jamaican migration to Cuba from 1925 onward.

===Post-colonial history===

Obeah came more into the open with the waning of British colonialism in the Caribbean. Around the 1940s, Jamaican prosecutions for Obeah began to reduce. Two years after Jamaica became independent, in 1964, the country saw its last conviction for Obeah. Reflecting changing attitudes, Jamaica&#x27;s Prime Minister Edward Seaga described Obeah as a form of faith healing and a part of Caribbean cultural heritage. In 1981, Jamaica&#x27;s formal gift for the wedding of Britain&#x27;s Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer was an obeah-influenced painting by Mallica Reynolds.

The late 20th century saw growing migration from the West Indies to metropolitan urban centres like Miami, New York, Toronto, and London, where practitioners of Obeah interacted with followers of other Afro-Caribbean traditions like Santeria, Vodou, and Espiritismus.
Some communities of Obeah practitioners are trying to develop communal rituals.

Since the 1980s there have been efforts to decriminalise Obeah practices throughout many Caribbean countries. These calls have sometimes emphasised the idea that Obeah should be permitted under the aegis of freedom of religion, although critics have objected by maintaining that Obeah is not a religion. Paton noted that Obeah lacked the &quot;self-confident promoters and interpreters&quot; to advance its case that had been found within Vodou, Santería, and Candomblé. The decriminalisation movement has nevertheless had successes; Anguilla removed proscriptions against it in 1980, Barbados in 1998, Trinidad and Tobago in 2000, and St Lucia in 2004. However, as of the early 21st century these practices remain widely illegal across the region, including in Jamaica. Enforcement is often lax and usually only when Obeah practitioners have also infringed on other laws. Most prosecutions center on accusations of charlatanism against Obeah practitioners who have charged large fees and not produced the promised results.

==Demographics==

Practitioners of Obeah are found across the Caribbean as well as in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. It is difficult to ascertain the number of clients who employ Obeahmen and Obeahwomen. In contexts like London, not all of those employing the Obeah specialists are of African-Caribbean background.

Trinidad had fewer cases of people practicing Obeah than Jamaica. In Trinidad, there was discrimination of what was a religion practice or what was considered Obeah. The reason was the cultural differences of the blacks and East Indian races living in Trinidad and Tobago .

==Reception and influence==

Written accounts of Obeah in the 19th and 20th century were largely produced by white visitors to the Caribbean who saw the tradition and its practitioners as being sinister. As Paton noted, &quot;for a long time obeah was the ultimate signifier of the Caribbean&#x27;s difference from Europe, a symbol of the region&#x27;s supposed inability to be part of the modern world.&quot;

Official views of Obeah throughout the Caribbean have been consistently negative, while many people in the Caribbean regard Obeah as a dangerous and hostile phenomenon.
Ongoing stigma surrounding Obeah is partly due to the opposition of Protestant Evangelicalism. Also hostile to Obeah are Rastafari, who regard it as a reflection of the oppressive and un-Godly forces that they term &quot;Babylon&quot;.
For these critics, Obeah is deemed fundamentally immoral, and often explicitly Satanic. Attempts to repurpose the term &quot;Obeah&quot; in a more positive fashion have come largely from academia and from culturally nationalist politics.

In various Caribbean countries, singers and musical groups have adopted the term &quot;Obeah&quot; in their name. An early example of this was the Bahamian singer Tony McKay, who cultivated the nickname &quot;Exuma, the Obeah Man&quot; after the title of his 1970 song. Bilby argued that in these cases, the use of the term was a &quot;gesture towards reclaiming ancestral power&quot;. Elsewhere in Caribbean music, Obeah has been used as a theme for the humorous exploration of gender relations, as in Mighty Sparrow&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Obeah Wedding,&quot; or has been denounced as harmful, as in The Ethiopians&#x27; 1977 reggae song &quot;Obeah Book&quot;.

<text>Nathan Birnbaum (; pseudonyms: &quot;Mathias Acher&quot;, &quot;Dr. N. Birner&quot;, &quot;Mathias Palme&quot;, &quot;Anton Skart&quot;, &quot;Theodor Schwarz&quot;, and &quot;Pantarhei&quot;; 16 May 1864 – 2 April 1937) was an Austrian writer and journalist, Jewish thinker and nationalist. His life had three main phases, representing a progression in his thinking: a Zionist phase (c. 1883 – c. 1900); a Jewish cultural autonomy phase (c. 1900 – c. 1914), which included the promotion of the Yiddish language; and a religious phase (c. 1914–1937), when he turned to Orthodox Judaism and became staunchly anti-Zionist.

He married Rosa Korngut (1869–1934) and they had three sons: Solomon (Salomo) (1891–1989), Menachem (1893–1944), and Uriel (1894–1956).

== Early life ==
Birnbaum was born in Vienna into an Eastern European Jewish family with roots in Austrian Galicia and Hungary. His father, Menachem Mendel Birnbaum, a merchant, hailed from Ropshitz, Galicia (now Poland), and his mother, Miriam Birnbaum (née Seelenfreund), who was born in Carpathian Rus (now Ukraine), of a family with illustrious rabbinic lineage, had moved as a child to Tarnow, Galicia, where the two met and married.

From 1882 to 1886, Birnbaum studied law, philosophy and Near Eastern studies at the University of Vienna.

== Zionism ==
In 1883, at the age of 19, he founded Kadimah, the first Jewish (Zionist) student association in Vienna, many years before Theodor Herzl became the leading spokesman of the Zionist movement. While still a student, he founded and published the periodical &quot;Selbstemanzipation!&quot;, often written in large part by Birnbaum himself. In it he coined the terms &quot;Zionistic&quot;, &quot;Zionist&quot;, &quot;Zionism&quot; (1890), and &quot;political Zionism&quot; (1892).

Birnbaum played a prominent part in the First Zionist Congress (1897) where he was elected Secretary-General of the Zionist Organization. He was associated with and was one of the most important representatives of the cultural, rather than political, side of Zionism. However, he left the Zionist Organization not long after the Congress. He was unhappy with its negative view of Diaspora Jewry and the transformation of the Zionist ideals into a party machine.

His next phase was to advocate Jewish cultural autonomy, or Golus nationalism, concentrating in particular on the Jews of eastern Europe. He advocated for the Jews to be recognized as a people among the other peoples of the empire, with Yiddish as their official language. He ran (in Buczacz, eastern Galicia) on behalf of the Jews (and with the support of the local Ukrainians) as candidate for the Austrian parliament. Although he had a majority of the votes, his election was thwarted by corruption of the electoral process by the local Polish faction.

He was chief convener of the Conference for the Yiddish Language held in Czernowitz, August 30 –September 3, 1908. It was the first Yiddish-language conference ever to take place. At the conference, he took the place of his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist Sholem Aleichem who was critically ill.

From about 1912 onwards, Birnbaum became increasingly interested in Orthodox Judaism, and he became a fully observant Orthodox Jew in about 1916. He continued to act particularly as an advocate for the Jews of eastern Europe and the Yiddish language. From 1919 to 1922, he was General Secretary of the Agudas Yisroel, a widely-spread and influential Orthodox Jewish organization. He founded the society of the &quot;Olim&quot; (Hebrew for the &quot;Ascenders&quot;), a society with a specific program of action dedicated to the spiritual ascent of the Jewish people.

== Later life ==
Birnbaum, decrying political Zionism, 1919:
And is it at all possible that we, who regard Judaism as our one and only treasure, should ever be able to compete with such expert demagogues and loud self-advertisers as they [the Zionists]? It is surely not necessary that we should. We are, after all, still the mountains and they the grain, and all we need to do is to gather all our forces in a world organization of religious Jews, and it will follow of itself, and without the application of any great political cunning on our part, that we shall have it in our power to prevent what needs to be prevented and to carry out what we have to carry out. But there is no need to first create this world organization of religious Jews. It is already in existence. The world knows its name, it is Agudas Yisroel [The Union of Israel].

He continued to write and lecture. His most well-known publication of this period of his life was &quot;Gottes Volk&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s People&quot; (1918, in German), translated in 1921 to Yiddish, in 1946 to English as &quot;Confession&quot; (slightly abridged), and in 1948 to Hebrew as &quot;Am Hashem&quot;.

In 1933, at the time of the Nazi rise to power, Birnbaum and part of his family were living in Berlin. They fled together to Scheveningen in the Netherlands, with the help of businessman and diplomat Henri B. van Leeuwen (1888-1973) - Birnbaum, his wife, and their son Menachem, an artist, along with his own family. There, Birnbaum, van Leeuwen, and banker Daniel Wolfe published the anti-Zionist newspaper &quot;Der Ruf&quot; (&quot;The Call&quot;). While Menachem and his family were murdered by the Nazis in 1944-45, another son, Solomon (professor of Yiddish and Hebrew palaeography) and his family managed to flee from Hamburg to England. Their third son, Uriel, an artist and poet, together with his family fled from Vienna to the Netherlands in 1939. Van Leeuwen, also an Orthodox Jew, became a Dutch anti-Zionist leader and Bergen-Belsen survivor.

Birnbaum died in Scheveningen in 1937 after a period of severe illness.

<doc id="988717" wikidata="Q1026799" url="?curid=988717" title="Ellon, Aberdeenshire">
<text>Ellon () is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, approximately north of Aberdeen, lying on the River Ythan, which has one of the few undeveloped river estuaries on the eastern coast of Scotland. It is in the ancient region of Formartine. Its name is believed to derive from the Gaelic term &quot;Eilean&quot;, an island, on account of the presence of an island in the River Ythan, which offered a convenient fording point. In 1707 it was made a burgh of barony for the Earl of Buchan. It is home to a unique collection of ancient yew trees. 

== Places of interest ==
Places of interest within the town include Ellon Castle Gardens, recently brought back to life by volunteers and open to the public (see website for latest opening times). They include a walled garden of historical importance, yew trees dating back 500-800 years and the ruins of old Ellon Castle, and the surrounding walls known as the &quot;Deer Dyke&quot;. Ellon also has &quot;Auld Brig&quot;, a category A listed bridge across the Ythan, built in 1793 and still in use as a pedestrian bridge.

The Riverside Park offers walkways alongside the Ythan, from which herons, salmon, trout and otters may be observed.

In 2013, BrewDog built a brewery at a cost of £7.8 million in a greenfield site just outside of Ellon. The brewery is designed to minimise carbon emissions with the use of treatment plants, biogas technology and since 2021, an anerobic digestion plant. In 2016, the brewery was expanded at a cost of £5 million including the addition of a new 300-hectolitre (hL) brew house.

The ruins of the Kinmuck Castle are located about north-east of Ellon. That castle was dismantled in 1413 to build the old Ellon Castle.

== Education ==
The town has three primary schools:
* Ellon Primary School
* Auchterellon Primary School
* Meiklemill Primary School

Each of these schools has some type of greenspace as well as a concrete playground. These schools feed into Ellon Academy, the local secondary school, which currently has a roll of about 1200 students; however, due to ongoing residential development in the area that figure is expected to rise. A new school (Ellon Academy) was opened in July 2015, on the outskirts of Ellon.

== Leisure ==

Ellon has a community centre, which includes a swimming pool and café.

The Ythan Centre was a building dedicated to serving the needs of Ellon&#x27;s teenage population. It is currently being used by Ellon Baptist Church who, from January 2019, began a five-year lease on the property which had been unoccupied since February 2016.

The Meadows sports centre, located on the outskirts of Ellon, has many sporting facilities and clubs, including football and rugby pitches, an astroturf pitch for hockey, a gym, and a multi-use sports hall. The Meadows is also home to Ellon United football team, the Ellon Rugby Club and Ellon Hockey Club.

== Media ==
The town has one weekly newspaper: the &quot;Ellon Times&quot;.

== Housing ==
Ellon has benefited from the North Sea oil demand, and is one of the main dormitory towns for Aberdeen. It is part of the proposed Energetica corridor of development. The population is expanding as young families seek to escape Aberdeen and move to nearby towns like Ellon, Inverurie and Banchory. During 2006, Ellon ranked as the town with the fourth most rapidly increasing average house prices in Scotland.

== Transport ==
Ellon is bypassed by the A90 road, which offers convenient access to Aberdeen to the south and Peterhead and Fraserburgh to the north. Other major road links are the A920 west to Oldmeldrum and Huntly, and the A948 north to New Deer.

Regular and frequent bus services link Ellon with Aberdeen, Inverurie, Peterhead, Fraserburgh and surrounding towns and villages, serving both the town centre and Ellon Park and Ride at the eastern edge of the town.

Ellon railway station was a principal station on the Great North of Scotland Railway line that ran from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh and Peterhead. Due to the Beeching Axe, passenger services were withdrawn on the Formartine and Buchan Railway line in 1965. Freight services continued on the line until 1979 (Fraserburgh only, the Maud-Peterhead section was closed in 1970), at which point the entire line was closed.

The former railway line was purchased by Grampian Regional Council in 1981, and is now part of the National Cycling Route network.

Due to the population expansion since the North Sea Oil boom, the A90 has become overloaded between Aberdeen, Ellon and Peterhead. The Aberdeen Crossrail project has looked at reopening sections of the former railway, however as of March 2009 this is still unlikely.

The Boddam Branch that ran to Boddam via Cruden Bay started at Ellon. This closed in 1945.

<text>Dana Delany (born March 13, 1956) is an American actress. After appearing in small roles early in her career, Delany received her breakthrough role as Colleen McMurphy on the ABC television drama &quot;China Beach&quot; (1988–1991), for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1989 and 1992. She received further recognition for her appearances in the films &quot;Light Sleeper&quot; (1992), &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; (1994), &quot;The Margaret Sanger Story&quot; (1995), &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; (1996), &quot;True Women&quot; (1997), and &quot;Wide Awake&quot; (1998). Delany also provided the voice of Lois Lane in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

In the 2000s, Delany appeared in main roles on several short-lived television series, including &quot;Pasadena&quot; (2001), &quot;Presidio Med&quot; (2002–2003), and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (2006–2007). From 2007 to 2010, she starred as Katherine Mayfair on the ABC television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, for which she received a Prism Award in 2009. Delany then starred as Megan Hunt on the ABC medical drama &quot;Body of Proof&quot; (2011–2013), and as Crystal Harris on the Amazon Prime Video drama series &quot;Hand of God&quot; (2014–2017).

==Early life==
Delany was born in New York City, the daughter of interior designer Mary Burnett Welles and John Joseph Delany, CEO of Coyne &amp; Delany Co., a plumbing manufacturing firm. She has a sister, Corey, and a brother, Sean. She was raised Roman Catholic. She has stated that, even as a little girl, she always wanted to go into acting. &quot;The reason a person first gets into acting is because you want attention from your parents as a little girl,&quot; she told a reporter. In her childhood, she went with her family to many Broadway shows and was fascinated by films.

After growing up in Stamford, Connecticut, she attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for her senior year and was a member of the school&#x27;s first co-educational class. Then-senior Delany wrote an op-ed in 1974 about her experience of being a one-year student during the school&#x27;s first year of co-education. &quot;Andover was the best time of my life,&quot; she recalled. She played the lead role of Nellie Forbush in the school&#x27;s spring musical production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; opposite Peter Kapetan as Emile. She commented: &quot;It was just a little awkward to be Nellie at first because she hesitates to marry Emile since he had once lived with a Polynesian woman – I don&#x27;t agree with her reasoning so that made things a bit hard at the beginning.&quot; She appeared in a student video directed by classmate Jonathan Meath in a film class taught by Steve Marx. She graduated in 1974 with the academic honor of nomination to the school chapter of the Cum Laude Society, awarded that year to 80 out of 378 graduating seniors.

She majored in theater at Wesleyan University, where (among other productions) she appeared in one of the first performances of María Irene Fornés feminist play &quot;Fefu and Her Friends.&quot; Delany also worked summer stock productions during vacations before graduating in 1978. Later, in an interview, she reported that she sometimes had eating disorders during this time of her life. She said: &quot;I binged... I starved ... I was one step from anorexia – a piece of toast and an apple would be all I would eat in a day.&quot;

==Career==
===1980s: Stage, television, &quot;China Beach&quot;===
After college, she found acting work in New York City in daytime soap operas including &quot;Love of Life&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and supported herself by acting in commercials such as for Wisk laundry detergent. She starred in the Broadway show &quot;A Life&quot; and won critical acclaim in 1983 in Nicholas Kazan&#x27;s off-Broadway &quot;Blood Moon&quot;, where &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited her &quot;skillful verisimilitude&quot; handling a difficult part requiring two roles &quot;and she does them both with authority.&quot; Delany moved to Hollywood and during the next few years found work guest starring in TV shows like &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;.

Delany&#x27;s first audition for the lead role of nurse Colleen McMurphy was unsuccessful. &quot;They thought I wasn&#x27;t pretty enough&quot;, she said in an interview. She finally won the role after she showed up to her next audition with her &quot;long tresses cut into a bob&quot; after the producers lost their first choice (Delany had cut her hair at the request of director Paul Schrader who had cast her in the film &quot;Patty Hearst&quot;). &quot;China Beach&quot; aired weekly from 1988 to 1991 and brought intense media attention to the actress. This role not only garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards, but two additional Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe Award nominations. The show ended after four seasons in 1991.

===1990s: Movies, television, voice===

In 1991, Delany was chosen by &quot;People&quot; magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. In the years following &quot;China Beach&quot;, Delany worked steadily in television, movies and theater. In addition, she established herself as a significant voice talent.

Delany won leading roles in a string of feature films such as the TV movie &quot;A Promise to Keep&quot;, &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Housesitter&quot; and &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; as well as appearing in the TV mini-series &quot;Wild Palms&quot;. She also took on controversial roles, such as Mistress Lisa in &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;, where one film critic commented &quot;The script was awful—Dana looked great.&quot;

On September 21, 1993, the CBS television film &quot;Donato and Daughter&quot;, directed by Rod Holcomb, premiered. In it Delany is paired with Charles Bronson to play the leads. Delany plays Bronson&#x27;s daughter, both cops assigned to investigate a serial killer. Delany pointed to several reason to why she wanted to do the project. She said the story was appealing because &quot;it was the relationship between the two that interested me. We see so many movies now about serial killers, it&#x27;s really being overdone, so I wanted to emphasize the relationship between father and daughter.&quot; Also she liked that they were no romantic subplot by saying &quot;why is it that in every movie, there has to be a male female thing going on? Why can&#x27;t it be about a woman and her family and her work? That was the challenge because you want her to be strong and capable, but you also don&#x27;t want her to be one-dimensional.&quot; Another reason she accepted is because she wanted to work with Charles Bronson. In Kay Gardella&#x27;s review published in &quot;The Gazette&quot; she says &quot;Delany and Bronson work well together. Bronson shows a warmer, more caring side than his usual tough-guy image allows. And Delany, as attractive as ever, is crisp and efficient as cop.&quot;

On December 25, &quot;Tombstone&quot; premiered in cinemas. She turned in her best known performance of the decade alongside Kurt Russell&#x27;s Wyatt Earp, playing his love interest and future bride Josephine Marcus.

Now a box office draw in her own right, the stage was set for the success she would encounter later in her career. &quot;Live Nude Girls&quot; included frank discussion by women of their sexual fantasies at a bachelorette party using a low-budget improvisational comedy format with strong chemistry between the actors. Reviews were mixed: &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Richard Natale liked the film but wrote older male film executives believed it to be &quot;uncommercial&quot;; another critic agreed it was &quot;genuine girl talk&quot; but &quot;didn&#x27;t have a lot of substance&quot; and viewers &quot;don&#x27;t get to know the characters in the film&quot;. She also starred as Margaret Sanger in the TV movie &quot;Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story&quot; (1995), about the controversial nurse who crusaded for women&#x27;s reproductive rights in the early 1900s.

In 1995, Delany appeared in the Broadway show &quot;Translations&quot; and in May 1997, she returned to her alma mater Phillips Academy to work with theater students as an artist-in-residence. She appeared in TV movies such as &quot;True Women&quot; (1997) and &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1999). In 1998, Delany reportedly turned down the role of Carrie Bradshaw in the hit TV show &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She declined the role partly because of the negative audience reaction she received with a similar film, &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;, a few years prior. &quot;Sex and the City&quot; became a successful series, and the role of Carrie made Sarah Jessica Parker world-famous. Delany played a gun-toting mother in an episode of the TV series &quot;Family Law&quot; (1999) for which she earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, but the series was not rerun due to sponsorship withdrawal.

Delany&#x27;s first voice work was the character Andrea Beaumont in the 1993 animated feature film &quot;&quot; based on the popular TV show &quot;&quot;. She was also mentioned by name in one variation of the theme song of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, another Warner Bros. production. She then voiced Lois Lane in &quot;&quot;, reprised her role as Lois Lane for the character&#x27;s guest appearances in &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. She also voiced the character in &quot;The Batman&quot;. She returned to the DC Universe in an episode of &quot;&quot; as Vilsi, an alternate universe variation of Lois Lane. She reprised her role in the 2013 animated movie, &quot;Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox&quot;.

===2000s: Television, movies, stage, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;===

Delany continued to find work in a variety of projects, doing pilots, TV series, made-for-TV movies, and feature films. She appeared in the NBC drama &quot;Good Guys/Bad Guys&quot; (2000), which &quot;Newsweek&quot; termed a &quot;Sopranos knock-off&quot;. She appeared in the short-lived &quot;Pasadena&quot; (2001), a Fox production which was described as a &quot;twisted rich-family saga&quot; with a &quot;great cast&quot;. Delany commented in an interview: &quot;You can see &quot;Pasadena&quot; as a black comedy or see it as really tragic. A lot of soaps on television now don&#x27;t have that layer of tragedy to them.&quot; She was an actor and co-executive producer of the film &quot;Final Jeopardy&quot; (2001). &quot;New York Daily News&quot; TV critic David Bianculli gave a positive review to both her performance as an actor—&quot;Delany, as always, does pensive and independent better than most actresses&quot;—and as a producer. She played a doctor in the TV series &quot;Presidio Med&quot; (2002), described as a &quot;conventional but pleasant drama populated by characters dedicated to medicine who also have messy personal lives.&quot; She appeared in TV movies such as &quot;A Time to Remember&quot; (2003), and &quot;Baby for Sale&quot; (2004). She appeared in feature films by indie film producers, such as &quot;The Outfitters&quot; (1999), &quot;Mother Ghost&quot; (2002), and &quot;Spin&quot; (2003).

Returning to theater, she played an artsy and incompetent woman who questions the &quot;imposed conventions of society&quot; after discovering her husband&#x27;s affair in the Pulitzer-prize winning &quot;Dinner With Friends&quot; (2000, New York City, Los Angeles, Boston); her performance earned positive reviews generally. She played Beatrice in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (2003, San Diego); one critic described the &quot;verbal sparring&quot; between Delany and actor Billy Campbell as a &quot;joy&quot;.

From 2004 to 2006, Delany played many guest roles on TV shows, such as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Related&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot;, and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. She also starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (2006). One critic wrote &quot;Delany is alternately furious and despondent as Ellie, and she and Hutton (Timothy Hutton) can do more without words than other actors can do with pages of dialogue. They&#x27;re absolutely convincing as rich, complicated Manhattanites and as parents who come face to face with the scary reality that they can&#x27;t always protect their kids.&quot;

Delany appeared as herself in the TV documentary &quot;Vietnam Nurses with Dana Delany&quot; which explored their lives and treatment after returning to the United States. Delany has become &quot;something of a heroine to the nurses who served in Vietnam&quot;, according to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Susan King, who noted that the actress worked on a nationwide nurse recruitment program in 1990 called the McMurphy project.

In 2007, Delany appeared in the films &quot;A Beautiful Life&quot;, &quot;Camp Hope&quot;, and &quot;Multiple Sarcasms&quot;.

Delany initially declined the offer to play one of the four &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; principal characters, Bree Van De Kamp, saying it was too similar to her role on &quot;Pasadena&quot;. The show became a popular prime-time soap opera with substantial ratings. But in 2007 she was again offered a role by producer Marc Cherry, this time as a supporting housewife, and she joined the cast of the well-established series for the 2007–08 season. Reaction to the addition of Delany was positive; one critic wrote &quot;...casting Dana Delany as Katherine Mayfair in Season 4 is one of the smartest things Cherry has ever done. Not many actors can deftly deliver both comedy and drama, but Delany makes it look easy.&quot; She commented about playing housewife Katherine Mayfair: &quot;The hardest thing for me was figuring out the tone of the piece because it&#x27;s such a specific tone – so it was more of an acting challenge than anything else.&quot; She commented in 2008: &quot;I hope that she doesn&#x27;t lose her snarkiness, because that&#x27;s always fun to play.&quot; On May 13, 2008, it was announced that Delany would reprise her role on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; for season five, having been promoted to the sixth lead.

===2010s: Television series and movies===
In March 2010, Delany appeared as FBI agent Jordan Shaw in a two-part story on the TV series &quot;Castle&quot;, which stars Nathan Fillion, who played her character&#x27;s second husband on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Delany also voiced a character &quot;Margaret Rosenblatt&quot; in the film &quot;Firebreather&quot; in 2010. Delany left &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; to star in the new ABC series &quot;Body of Proof&quot; originally slated to begin airing in late 2010. In the series, Delany played a brilliant neurosurgeon turned medical examiner after a car accident causes her to lose dexterity in her hands. Delany in real life had an experience similar to her character of Dr. Megan Hunt. Two weeks before filming the pilot episode, Delany&#x27;s car was hit by a bus in Santa Monica; two fingers of her hand were broken and her car was totaled. Delany describes her character in &quot;Body of Proof&quot; as being &quot;complicated, smart, and definitely complex.&quot;

In May 2011, Delany was the host of the fourth annual &quot;Television Academy Honors&quot;. In 2011, Delany came ninth in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual 100 Most Beautiful list. Delany appeared in the crime drama &quot;Freelancers&quot; with director Jessy Terrero. The film also stars Robert De Niro, Forest Whitaker, and 50 Cent. It was released to DVD on August 21, 2012, and had a limited release in theatres in September.

In December 2016, Delany was the primetime guest host on Turner Classic Movies. She appeared in dozens of wraparounds on the channel, filling in for Robert Osborne. Delany was cast for CBS&#x27;s Drama &quot;The Code&quot; in August 2018.

==Personal life and public image==

Delany was a member of the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Political Committee. Since the mid-1990s, Delany has served on the board of the Scleroderma Research Foundation, and with her friend Sharon Monsky, she helped campaign for support in finding a cure for scleroderma. Working with director Bob Saget, she starred in the TV movie &quot;For Hope&quot; (1996) based on Saget&#x27;s sister Gay, who had died as a result of the disease. She appeared as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy&quot; in 2001, 2006 and 2009 to raise money for scleroderma research. Scleroderma &quot;robs these women of not only their own lives in many cases, but robs their families which include countless children,&quot; she explained in 2002.

Delany is a board member of the arts advocacy organization Creative Coalition. She appeared in June 2009 in an onstage meeting in New York alongside White House social secretary Desiree Rogers to discuss ways to promote American cinematic creativity. In August 2009, Delany was named co-president of the Creative Coalition, joining Tim Daly in the leadership of the organization. Delany explained her support for the arts in an interview: &quot;I just think it&#x27;s so important for children and the future of the country and people&#x27;s general happiness. I&#x27;m one of those people who, whenever I feel cut off spiritually or emotionally, I go to a museum or a play or a movie, and I&#x27;m just transported.&quot; She participated as a celebrity guest in fundraising events that support the rights of same-sex couples to marry.

In addition, she has supported Planned Parenthood. She attended the organization&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration in New York City in 2006. Delany said: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine where we&#x27;d be in this country had Margaret Sanger not founded that first clinic here in New York, 90 years ago.&quot; She attended events sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. She is a Democrat who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Delany has never been married nor had any children. She commented about her personal life in an interview in 2006: &quot;I turned 50 and I&#x27;m ready to get married... I don&#x27;t know who he is yet but I&#x27;m ready... He has to be smart, funny and kind.&quot; She added a year later: &quot;Marriage has never been a big deal for me... But I think I&#x27;m ready now... I got to have all the fun in the world, to experience a lot of people and figure out what I really like.&quot; Delany (in 1988) said she doesn&#x27;t find being a celebrity to be that appealing: &quot;I&#x27;m not a &#x27;personality&#x27;. I am never recognized, which I take as a compliment. I have a love-hate thing with publicity.&quot;

Delany, in 2003, tried having an injection of botox in her forehead, but the needle hit a nerve and created a bruise that affected the muscle in her right eye, causing it to droop slightly. In 2010, she vowed she would never have plastic surgery.

In 2010, Delany told &quot;Prevention&quot; that she prefers eating healthily, including vegetables, tofu, fish, gluten-free pasta, and bread.

In April 2011, Delany came 9th in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual 100 Most Beautiful list.

In 2019, Delany commented on her approach to acting:

<text>The DEUCE (&quot;Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine&quot;) was one of the earliest British commercially available computers, built by English Electric from 1955. It was the production version of the Pilot ACE, itself a cut-down version of Alan Turing&#x27;s ACE.

== Hardware description ==
The DEUCE had 1450 thermionic valves, and used mercury delay lines for its main memory; each of the 12 delay lines could store 32 instructions or data words of 32 bits each. It adopted the then high 1 megahertz clock rate of the Pilot ACE. Input/output was via Hollerith 80-column punch-card equipment. The reader read cards at the rate of 200 per minute, while the card punch rate was 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE also had an 8192-word magnetic drum for main storage. To access any of the 256 tracks of 32 words, the drum had one group of 16 read and one group of 16 write heads, each group on independent moveable arms, each capable of moving to one of 16 positions. Access time was 15 milliseconds if the heads were already in position; an additional 35 milliseconds was required if the heads had to be moved. There was no rotational delay incurred when reading from and writing to drum. Data was transferred between the drum and one of the 32-word delay lines.

The DEUCE could be fitted with paper tape equipment; the reader speed was 850 characters per second, while the paper tape output speed was 25 characters per second. (The DEUCE at the University of New South Wales {UTECOM} had a Siemens M100 teleprinter attached in 1964, giving 10 characters per second input/output). Decca magnetic tape units could also be attached. The automatic multiplier and divider operated asynchronously (that is, other instructions could be executed while the multiplier/divider unit was in operation). Two arithmetic units were provided for integer operations: one of 32 bits and another capable of performing 32-bit operations and 64-bit operations. Auto-increment and auto-decrement were provided on eight registers from about 1957. Array arithmetic and array data transfers were permitted. Compared with contemporaries such as the Manchester Mark 1, DEUCE was about ten times faster.

The individual words of the quadruple registers were associated with an auto-increment/decrement facility. That facility could be used for counting and for modifying instructions (for indexing, loop control, and for changing the source or destination address of an instruction).

Being a bit-serial machine, access time to a single register was 32 microseconds, a double register 64 microseconds, and a quadruple register 128 microseconds. That for a delay line was 1024 microseconds.

Instruction times were: addition, subtraction, logical operations: 64 microseconds for 32-bit words; double-precision 96 microseconds; multiplication and division 2 milliseconds. For array arithmetic and transfer operations, time per word was 33 microseconds per word for 32 words.

Floating-point operations were provided by software; times: 6 milliseconds for addition and subtraction, 5.5 milliseconds average for multiplication, and 4.5 milliseconds average for division.

In the early machines, all instructions involving the magnetic drum were interlocked while an operation was in progress. Thus, if the read heads were moved, any subsequent magnetics operation such as to read a track or write a track, were prohibited from proceeding until the first had completed. From about 1957, a new unit, called &quot;rationalised magnetics&quot; was made available. This unit eliminated unnecessary interlocks. Thus, it was possible to execute an instruction that moved the read heads: if followed by an instruction to move the write heads, or to write a track, such instructions were not interlocked, and could proceed in parallel with moving the read heads.

The front panel of the DEUCE featured two CRT displays: one showed the current contents of registers, while the other showed the content of any one of the mercury delay line stores.

From about 1958, seven extra delay lines could be attached, giving 224 more words of high-speed store. An IBM 528 combined reader–punch could be substituted for the Hollerith equipment, giving the same input/output speeds, in which case the machine was called Mark II. Automatic conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD was provided on input, and the reverse operation on output, for all eighty card columns. On this equipment, reading and punching could proceed simultaneously, if required, and thus could be used for reading in a record, updating it, and then punching an updated record simultaneously with reading in the next record. With the seven extra delay lines, the DEUCE was denoted Mark IIA.

==Software==
The principal high-level programming languages were GEORGE (General Order Generator), ALPHACODE, STEVE, TIP, GIP, and ALGOL. Assembler language translators included ZP43 and STAC.

Invented by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957, GEORGE was closest to present-day programming languages. It used Reverse Polish Notation. For example, to evaluate
&quot;e&quot; = &quot;ay&quot;2 + &quot;by&quot; + &quot;c&quot;, one wrote

where &quot;dup&quot; duplicates the previous entry, being the same as using &quot;y&quot; here.

GEORGE provided a 12-position accumulator as a push-down pop-up stack.
Using a variable name in a program (e.g., &#x27;d&#x27;) brought the value of variable &#x27;d&#x27;
into the accumulator (i.e., pushed d onto the top-of-stack), while
enclosing a name in parentheses {e.g., (d) } assigned to variable &#x27;d&#x27;
the value at the top of the stack (accumulator). To destroy (pop and
discard) the value at the top of the stack, the semicolon (;) was used.
The following GEORGE program reads in ten numbers and prints their squares:

In the above program, the &quot;dup&quot; command duplicated the top of the stack,
so that there were then two copies of the value at the top of the stack.

GIP (General Interpretive Programme) was a control program for manipulating programs called &quot;bricks&quot;. Its principal service was in the running of programs from the several hundred in the DEUCE linear algebra library. Preparation of such a program involved selecting the required bricks (on punch cards), copying them and GIP in a reproducing punch, and assembling the copies into a deck of cards. Next, simple codewords would be written to use the bricks to perform such tasks as: matrix multiplication; matrix inversion; term-by-term matrix arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); solving simultaneous equations; input; and output. The dimensions of matrices were never specified in the codewords. Dimensions were taken from the matrices themselves, either from a card preceding the data cards or from the matrices as stored on drum. Thus, programs were entirely general. Once written, such a program handled any size of matrices (up to the capacity of the drum, of course). A short program to read in a matrix from cards, to transpose the matrix, and to punch the results on cards requires the following codewords:

In each of the codewords, the fourth number is the brick number. The first codeword specifies that the matrix is read from cards and stored at drum address 5; the second codeword specifies that the matrix at drum address 5 is transposed, and the result is stored at drum address 120; and the third punches that result on cards.

STAC was a macro-assembler. Most instructions were written in the form of a transfer, in decimal, such as 13-16, meaning to copy the word in register 13 to register 16. The location of the instruction was not specified. STAC allocated an instruction to a word in a delay line, and computed the six components of the binary instruction. It allocated the next instruction to a location that was optimum, to be executed as soon as the previous instruction was complete, if possible.

The following program reads in a value, n, and then reads in n binary integers. It punches out the integer and its square. Comments in lower case explain the instruction.

STAC would produce the following instructions (in addition to the binary program). The memory location of each instruction is shown at the left.

Wait and timing numbers are not shown, except for the multiplication.

==Programming==
Programming the DEUCE was different from other computers. The serial nature of the delay lines required that instructions be ordered such that when one instruction completed execution, the next one was ready to emerge from a Delay Line. For operations on the single registers, the earliest time that the next instruction could be obeyed was 64 microseconds after the present one. Thus, instructions were not executed from sequential locations. In general, instructions could transfer one or more words. Consequently, each instruction specified the location of the next instruction. Optimum programming meant that as each instruction was executed, the next one was just emerging from a Delay Line. The position of instructions in the store could greatly affect performance if the location of an instruction was not optimum.

Reading data from the card reader was done in real-time – each row had to be read as it passed the read brushes, without stopping. Similarly for the card punch; the word for a particular row was prepared in advance and had to be ready when a given row of the card was in position under the punch knives. The normal mode of reading and punching was binary. Decimal input and output was performed via software.

The high-speed store consisted of four single-word registers of 32 bits each, three double-word registers, and two quadruple-word registers. Each 32-bit word of the double and quadruple-word registers could be addressed separately. They could also be accessed as a pair, and—in the case of the quadruple registers—as a group of three or four. The instruction store consisted of twelve mercury delay lines, each of 32 words, and numbered 1 to 12. Delay line 11 (DL11) served as the buffer between the magnetic drum and the high-speed store. Being a &quot;transfer machine&quot;, data could be transferred a word at a time, a pair of words at a time, and any number of words up to 33 at a time. Thus, for example, 32 words read from the drum could be transferred as a block to any of the other delay lines; four words could be transferred as a block from one quadruple register to the other, or between a quadruple register and a delay line—all with one instruction. The 32 words of a delay line could be summed by passing them to the single-length adder (by means of a single instruction).

By a special link between DL10 and one register, namely, register 16, DL10 could be used as a push-down stack.

==Production==
The first three machines were delivered in the spring of 1955; in late 1958 a DEUCE Mark II improved model appeared. This version employed a combined card reader and punch. The combined IBM 528 reader and punch behaved like the separate Hollerith units on the earlier DEUCE Mark I machines; however, it was also provided with hardware conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD on input, and vice versa on output. Data could also be read in and punched simultaneously at 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE Mark IIA provided seven extra mercury delay lines, each of 32 words.

A total of 33 DEUCE machines were sold between 1955 and 1964, two being purchased by the engine manufacturer Bristol Siddeley.

The success of DEUCE was due to its program library of over 1000 programs and subroutines.

A combined IBM 528 card reader and punch could read cards at 200 per minute, and punch at 100 cards per minute. When simultaneously started, the reader and punch ran at 100 cards per minute. Automatic conversion to and from 6-bit characters was provided. This mode was in addition to the programmed conversion provided by the Mark I DEUCE.

===DEUCE MARK IA AND IIA===
As above, with seven extra delay lines providing 224 words of high-speed store.

Notes:
The multiplier and divider were asynchronous.
Several integers could be multiplied in a single execution of the multiply instruction, by inserting integers in the multiplier or multiplicand registers during multiplication, and by extracting results during multiplication.

Other special effects included counting the bits in a word, and converting Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to binary.

Similarly for division, which could be used for
converting integers to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), and for
converting pounds, shillings, and pence to pence.

<doc id="988729" wikidata="Q775940" url="?curid=988729" title="Diplopia">
<text>Diplopia is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object that may be displaced in relation to each other. Also called double vision, it is a loss of visual focus under regular conditions, and is often voluntary. However, when occurring involuntarily, it results from impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional, but they cannot turn to target the desired object. Problems with these muscles may be due to mechanical problems, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, disorders of the cranial nerves (III, IV, and VI) that innervate the muscles, and occasionally disorders involving the supranuclear oculomotor pathways or ingestion of toxins.

Diplopia can be one of the first signs of a systemic disease, particularly to a muscular or neurological process, and it may disrupt a person&#x27;s balance, movement, or reading abilities.

==Causes==
Diplopia has a diverse range of ophthalmologic, infectious, autoimmune, neurological, and neoplastic causes:

==Diagnosis==
Diplopia is diagnosed mainly by information from the patient. Doctors may use blood tests, physical examinations, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find the underlying cause.

===Classification===

One of the first steps in diagnosing diplopia is often to see whether one of two major classifications may be eliminated. That involves blocking one eye to see which symptoms are evident in each eye alone. Persisting blurry or double vision with one eye closed is classified as monocular diplopia.

=== Binocular ===

Binocular diplopia is the other one in which the blurring of vision occurs only when the patient looks through both eyes simultaneously. It is common and occurs in approximately 10.0% to 40.0% of zygomatic complex injuries. Furthermore, diplopia may be transient or persistent. Inadequate diagnosis and treatment at improper times and tethering or fibrosis of muscles may lead to persistent diplopia.

Binocular diplopia is double vision arising as a result of strabismus (in layman&#x27;s terms &quot;cross-eyed&quot;), the misalignment of the two eyes relative to each other, either esotropia (inward) or exotropia (outward). In such a case while the fovea of one eye is directed at the object of regard, the fovea of the other is directed elsewhere, and the image of the object of regard falls on an extrafoveal area of the retina. Acute diplopia is a diagnostic challenge. The most common cause of acute diplopia are ocular motor nerve palsies (OMP).

The brain calculates the visual direction of an object based upon the position of its image relative to the fovea. Images falling on the fovea are seen as being directly ahead, while those falling on retina outside the fovea may be seen as above, below, right, or left of straight ahead depending upon the area of retina stimulated. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, the brain perceives two images of one target object, as the target object simultaneously stimulates different, noncorresponding, retinal areas in either eye, thus producing double vision.

This correlation of particular areas of the retina in one eye with the same areas in the other is known as retinal correspondence. This relationship also gives rise to an associated phenomenon of binocular diplopia, although one that is rarely noted by those experiencing diplopia. Because the fovea of one eye corresponds to the fovea of the other, images falling on the two foveae are projected to the same point in space. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, two different objects will be perceived as superimposed in the same space. This phenomenon is known as &#x27;visual confusion&#x27;.

The brain naturally guards against double vision. In an attempt to avoid double vision, the brain can sometimes ignore the image from one eye, a process known as suppression. The ability to suppress is to be found particularly in childhood when the brain is still developing. Thus, those with childhood strabismus almost never complain of diplopia, while adults who develop strabismus almost always do. This ability to suppress might seem an entirely positive adaptation to strabismus, but in the developing child it can prevent the proper development of vision in the affected eye, resulting in amblyopia. Some adults are also able to suppress their diplopia, but their suppression is rarely as deep or as effective and takes much longer to establish; thus, they are not at risk of permanently compromising their vision. In some cases, diplopia disappears without medical intervention, but in other cases, the cause of the double vision may still be present.

Certain people with diplopia who cannot achieve fusion and yet do not suppress may display a certain type of spasm-like irregular movement of the eyes in the vicinity of the fixation point (see: Horror fusionis).

=== Monocular ===
Diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye; this is called monocular diplopia, or where the patient perceives more than two images, monocular polyopia. While serious causes rarely may be behind monocular diplopia symptoms, this is much less often the case than with binocular diplopia. The differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface keratoconus, subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior visual cortex, or nonorganic conditions, but diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom.

=== Temporary ===
Temporary binocular diplopia can be caused by alcohol intoxication or head injuries, such as concussion (if temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist immediately). It can also be a side effect of benzodiazepines or opioids, particularly if used recreationally in larger doses, the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, zonisamide and lamotrigine, as well as the hypnotic drug zolpidem and the dissociative drugs ketamine and dextromethorphan. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired or strained eye muscles. If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient should see an ophthalmologist immediately.

=== Voluntary ===
Some people are able to consciously uncouple their eyes, either by overfocusing closely (i.e., going cross-eyed) or unfocusing. Also, while looking at one object behind another object, the foremost object&#x27;s image is doubled (for example, placing one&#x27;s finger in front of one&#x27;s face while reading text on a computer monitor). In this sense, double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing stereograms possible.

Monocular diplopia may be induced in many individuals, even those with normal eyesight, with simple defocusing experiments involving fine, high-contrast lines.

==Treatment==

The appropriate treatment for binocular diplopia depends upon the cause of the condition producing the symptoms. Efforts must first be made to identify and treat the underlying cause of the problem. Treatment options include eye exercises, wearing an eye patch on alternative eyes, prism correction, and in more extreme situations, surgery or botulinum toxin. If your provider diagnoses swelling or inflammation of, or around the nerve, medicines called corticosteroids may be used.

Sometimes, the condition disappears without treatment. People with diabetes may be advised to keep tight control of their blood sugar level.

The provider may prescribe an eye patch to relieve the double vision. The patch can be removed after the nerve heals.

Surgery or special glasses (prisms) may be advised if there is no recovery in 6 to 12 months.

If diplopia turns out to be intractable, it can be managed as last resort by obscuring part of the patient&#x27;s field of view. This approach is outlined in the article on diplopia occurring in association with a condition called horror fusionis.
