<text>The Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan is the bicameral legislature of Kazakhstan, consisting of the upper house, the Senate, and the lower house, the Mäjilis. Both chambers conduct legislative sessions at the Parliament House in the capital of Astana.

The Mäjilis, the lower house, has 98 seats. Members are elected for five-year terms through a mixed-member majoritarian representation system. The Mäjilis plays a role in Kazakhstan’s legislative process, responsible for passing laws, approving the national budget, ratifying international treaties, and overseeing the executive branch. It also holds significant power in confirming key government appointments, such as the Prime Minister and cabinet members.

The Senate, the upper house, consists of 50 deputies who are appointed either by local legislative bodies (&quot;mäslihats&quot;), the President, or the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan for six-year terms. The Senate&#x27;s responsibilities include reviewing and approving laws passed by the Mäjilis, confirming presidential appointments to the judiciary and executive branches, and approving key presidential decrees, particularly those related to military force or the declaration of a state of emergency. The Senate also represents regional interests of Kazakhstan, providing a more localized perspective in the national legislative process. 

The Parliament of Kazakhstan was established under the Constitution in 1995, following the dissolution of the Supreme Council. The bicameral system marked a shift from the previous unicameral legislature. Over time, the Parliament has evolved to play a key role in shaping the legislative framework of Kazakhstan, contributing to the development of national policies and governance, and ensuring checks and balances within the political system.

== History ==
Kazakhstan’s parliament replaced the unicameral Supreme Soviet, a representative body first established in 1938 under the 1937 Constitution of the Kazakh SSR, and subsequently formed based on the 1978 Constitution of the Kazakh SSR and the 1993 Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Throughout its history, the Supreme Soviet was elected 13 times.

In the early 1990s, disagreements emerged between President Nursultan Nazarbayev and members of the Supreme Soviet. Most deputies at the time served on a part-time basis, balancing their duties with regular jobs, while the president advocated for a fully professional parliament. Deputies of the 12th Supreme Soviet often made decisions without secured funding, approving expenditures that exceeded the budget. This ultimately led to a significant backlog of unpaid social benefits.

One of the key tasks of the 12th Supreme Soviet was to adopt the first constitution of an independent Kazakhstan. The parliamentary debates were intense. The president’s proposal to create a bicameral parliament and the article allowing for the dissolution of parliament were not approved. On January 28, 1993, the Supreme Soviet adopted a constitution with a unicameral parliament. The chairman of the 12th Supreme Soviet, Serikbolsyn Abdildin, pursued a policy independent of the president. Unlike in neighboring Russia, where a constitutional crisis led to violent clashes, Kazakhstan’s conflict concluded with the parliament dissolving itself.

The president argued that the parliament hindered reform efforts, and some deputies also saw a need to dissolve all councils. On November 16, 1993, the Alatau District Council (Soviet) of Almaty issued an appeal to deputies at all levels, describing the councils as “synonymous with the old regime”. Deputies at all levels, including those of the Supreme Soviet, began resigning. In less than a month and a half, the council system in the republic had dissolved, with more than 25% of council deputies resigning. In December 1993, the Supreme Soviet decided to dissolve itself, transferring all powers to the president until new elections could be held. At the time, critics accused the president of initiating this dissolution. For example, Supreme Soviet Deputy Lyudmila Filaretova openly claimed that the dissolution was the president’s idea but later apologized for this statement. Zamanbek Nurkadilov, then mayor of Almaty, claimed in an interview that he had proposed the idea.

In 1995, following the dissolution of the Supreme Council of Kazakhstan by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, a new legislative body was established through a constitutional referendum held on 30 August 1995. This referendum resulted in the adoption of a new draft of the Constitution of Kazakhstan, which introduced a bicameral parliament, replacing the previous unicameral structure. The new system consisted of two houses: the Mäjilis (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). This reform came after a significant legal challenge when Tatyana Kvyatkovskaya, a journalist and former Supreme Council candidate, filed a lawsuit to annul the results of the 1994 Kazakh legislative elections. The lawsuit led to the dissolution of the Supreme Council and the invalidation of its laws. The formation of the new Parliament marked a political shift in Kazakhstan&#x27;s political structure, transitioning to a more complex system with separate representation at both the national and regional levels. Elections for the Mäjilis and Senate were held later in 1995, with the Mäjilis elections taking place in two rounds in December 1995, and the Senate elections held on 5 December 1995. This newly established Parliament convened for its first session on 30 January 1996, laying the foundation for Kazakhstan’s new legislative system under the revised Constitution.

In May 2007, amendments were made to the Kazakh Constitution, including changes to the electoral system for the Mäjilis, which shifted from mixed-member proportional representation to party-list proportional representation. Additionally, the amendments reduced the presidential term limits from seven years to five years. However, these changes also paved the way for a more authoritarian system, as the amendments exempted President Nazarbayev from term limits, effectively allowing him to remain in power indefinitely. This led to the 2007 legislative elections, where the ruling Nur Otan party won all the contested seats in the Mäjilis, eliminating opposition and establishing a one-party state for a brief period. The political landscape remained dominated by Nur Otan until minor opposition parties made a return in 2012.

In May 2010, the Kazakh Parliament granted Nursultan Nazarbayev the honorary title of &quot;Elbasy&quot; (meaning &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot;). This title provided Nazarbayev with vast powers, allowing him to control key government policies even without holding the office of President. It also granted him immunity from criminal prosecution for any actions taken during his time in office and protected his family’s assets, ensuring their continued influence in Kazakhstan&#x27;s political and economic landscape.

==Elections==

Kazakhstan held elections to the Senate on 1 October 2014. According to the Central Electoral Commission of Kazakhstan, it was &quot;an open and democratic electoral process&quot;. According to the OSCE, &quot;Preparations for the 26 April election were efficiently administered, however, necessary reforms for holding genuine democratic elections still have to materialize. The predominant position of the incumbent and the lack of genuine opposition limited voter choice. A restricted media environment stifled public debate and freedom of expression.&quot;

About 250 observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation were present for the voting. Four women were among the 80 candidates vying for the 16 open Senate seats. The results were announced on 7 October 2014.

The elections to the Mazhilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan of the Sixth Convocation took place on 20 March 2016. Six political parties attended the elections, three of them received more than 7% of the votes and passed to the Mazhilis of the Parliament. Those are the Nur Otan Party (82.20%), the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan “AK Zhol” (7.18%), the Communist People&#x27;s Party of Kazakhstan (CPPK) (7.14%). The Nur Otan Party accounts for 84 deputies in the Mazhilis, the AK Zhol Party – 7 deputies, CPPK – 7 deputies, 9 deputies were elected from the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan and 43 deputies of the previous convocation passed to the Mazhilis of the Sixth Convocation. In general, the deputy composition was renewed by 60%. The new composition of the Mazhilis includes 78 (73%) men, 29 (27%) women. The average age of the deputies is 55 (as of 31 March 2016); Under 40 years old – 7 deputies; from 40 to 60 years old – 77 deputies; over 60 years – 23 deputies. 34 (32%) of deputies have PhD degrees. The deputies represent various spheres: public service, business, NGO, education, science, etc. The ethnic composition of the Mazhilis is as follows Kazakhs, Russians, Ukrainians, as well as representatives of Azerbaijani, Armenian, Dungan, Korean, Uzbek, Uyghur, Chechen and other ethnic groups.

The 2021 election to the Mazhilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan was scheduled for January 10, 2021. Five political parties submitted party lists to the Central Election Commission (CEC). They included Nur Otan, People’s Party, Ak Zhol, Auyl People’s Democratic Patriotic Party and Adal (former Birlik Party) Party.

<doc id="999129" wikidata="Q297303" url="?curid=999129" title="ASCII Corporation">
<text>was a Japanese publishing company based in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It became a subsidiary of Kadokawa Group Holdings in 2004, and merged with another Kadokawa subsidiary MediaWorks on April 1, 2008, becoming ASCII Media Works. The company published &quot;Monthly ASCII&quot; as the main publication. ASCII is best known for creating the &quot;Derby Stallion&quot; video game series, the MSX computer, and the &quot;RPG Maker&quot; line of programming software.

==History==
===1977–1990: Founding and first projects===
ASCII was founded in 1977 by Kazuhiko Nishi and Keiichiro Tsukamoto. Originally the publisher of a magazine with the same name, &quot;ASCII&quot;, talks between Bill Gates and Nishi led to the creation of Microsoft&#x27;s first overseas sales office, ASCII Microsoft, in 1978. In 1980, ASCII made 1.2 billion yen of sales from licensing Microsoft BASIC. It was 40 percent of Microsoft&#x27;s sales, and Nishi became Microsoft&#x27;s Vice President of Sales for Far East. In 1983, ASCII and Microsoft introduced the MSX, a standardized specification for 8-bit home computers. In 1984, ASCII entered the semiconductor business, followed by a further expansion into commercial online service in 1985 under the brand of ASCII-NET. As the popularity of home video game systems soared in the 1980s, ASCII became active in the development and publishing of software and peripherals for popular consoles such as the Family Computer and Mega Drive. After Microsoft&#x27;s public stock offering in 1986, Microsoft founded its own Japanese subsidiary, Microsoft Co., Ltd., traded as Microsoft Kabushiki Kaisha (MSKK), and dissolved its partnership with ASCII. At around the same time, the company was also obliged to reform itself as a result of its aggressive diversification in the first half of the 1980s. The company went public in 1989.

===1989–2000: Satellites and later projects===
ASCII&#x27;s revenue in its fiscal year ending March 1996 was 56 billion yen, broken down by sectors: publications (52.5% or 27.0 billion yen), game entertainment (27.8% or 14.3 billion yen), systems and semiconductors (10.8% or 6 billion yen) and others. Despite its struggles to remain focused on its core businesses, the company continued to suffer from accumulated debts, until an arrangement was made that CSK Corporation would execute a major investment into ASCII in 1997.

In the mid-1990s, ASCII acquired the company Something Good, and renamed it to ASCII Something Good, through which they developed three Sega Saturn games: &quot;AI Shogi&quot; (1995), &quot;AI Igo&quot; (1997), &quot;AI Shogi 2&quot; (1998).

ASCII originally used the name Nexoft on early American releases. In 1991, they renamed Nexoft to ASCII Entertainment, although releases around this time used the Asciiware name. To focus on supporting the interactive entertainment channel in America, startup company Agetec (for &quot;Ascii Game Entertainment Technology&quot;) was spun off as an independent corporation in 1998 and later became a fully independent publisher one year later. Co-founder Tsukamoto had left ASCII to create a company of his own in 1992, named Impress.

===2000–2008: Ownership changes and dissolution===
On November 26, 2001, CSK Corporation and Unison Capital Partners L.P. announced the approval of transferring the control of its subsidiary ASCII to Unison Capital Partners L.P., effective on March 30, 2002, as part of a strategy to focus CSK&#x27;s operations on B2B enterprises. The transfer was approved on December 21, 2001. As a part of deal, ASCII&#x27;s outstanding debt owed to CSK was forgiven, and under Unison&#x27;s control, the ASCII&#x27;s Enterbrain and IT publishing divisions would maintain autonomy, while ASCII was restructured to concentrate on PC and IT publishing businesses.

On May 28, 2002, Unison Media Partners announced ASCII became a fully owned subsidiary of via share exchange, and ASCII would be delisted, effective on October 1, 2002. On November 18, 2002, the Astroarts subsidiary was renamed to ASCII, while ASCII was renamed to MediaLeaves. The former Astroarts subsidiary would inherit the publishing business of the former ASCII. On January 29, 2004, Unison Capital Partners, L.P. announced the sale of ASCII&#x27;s parent company MediaLeaves to Kadokawa Group Holdings, to be completed in March 2004.

On September 27, 2007, Kadokawa Group Holdings announced the merger between subsidiaries MediaWorks and ASCII under the name ASCII Media Works, effective on April 1, 2008. The merger was approved in 2008.
On January 10, 2010, the formerly named ASCII company MediaLeaves was merged into Enterbrain, dissolving the last of the ASCII entity.

== Products ==

===MSX===

MSX is a standardized home computer architecture, announced by Microsoft and ASCII on June 16, 1983. It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then vice-president at Microsoft Japan and director at ASCII Corporation. Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period. MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries. It is difficult to determine how many MSX computers were sold worldwide, but eventually, 5 million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone. Despite Microsoft&#x27;s involvement, few MSX-based machines were released in the United States. Before the great success of Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft produced video games. The &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, for example, was first written for MSX hardware.

<doc id="999130" wikidata="Q1565330" url="?curid=999130" title="HMS Scylla (98)">
<text>HMS &quot;Scylla&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was built by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (Greenock, Scotland), with the keel being laid down on 19 April 1939. She was launched on 24 July 1940, and commissioned 12 June 1942.

One of two sisters (the other was, appropriately, , see Scylla and Charybdis), &quot;Scylla&quot; was completed with four twin QF 4.5 in Mk.III in UD MK III mountings because of a shortage of the intended QF 5.25 inch gun mountings.

The forward superstructure was considerably modified to accommodate these and also to increase crew spaces. Known as the &#x27;toothless terrors&#x27;, they proved to be very good anti-aircraft ships, often leading to comparisons with their sisters armed with the heavier QF guns.

==History==

&quot;Scylla&quot; served with the Home Fleet escorting Arctic convoys. She was flagship of R. Adm. Robert Burnett during the battle for convoy PQ 18 in September 1942. She carried a signals intelligence team headed by F/O R. E. Gunn and on at least one trip to the Kola Peninsula she is reported as having collected Signals Intelligence (PRO HW 14/53 and 55). &quot;Scylla&quot; sailed for Gibraltar on 28 October 1942. The following month she was at the French North Africa landings (Operation Torch) as part of Force &quot;O&quot; with the Eastern Task Force, but in December was sent into the Bay of Biscay as part of the effort to catch homecoming Axis blockade runners.

On 31 December 1942, she was directed to the German blockade runner by a RAF Coastal Command Whitley from 502 Squadron based at RAF St Eval, Cornwall. The aircraft piloted by F/O Arthur Hodgson had located &quot;Rhakotis&quot; in appalling weather but after several attack runs they had run out of ammunition. The crew then shadowed the target for over an hour, reporting the vessel&#x27;s position enabling &quot;Scylla&quot; to intercept &quot;Rhakotis&quot; some north-west of Cape Finisterre in position , where &quot;Scylla&quot; opened fire. She hit &quot;Rhakotis&quot; numerous times with &quot;Scylla&quot;&#x27;s main armament before torpedoing and sinking her. F/O Hodgson was awarded the DFC for his part in the operation. In February she returned to the Home Fleet for Arctic convoys but was back in the Bay of Biscay by June 1943 to cover anti-submarine operations.

In July 1943 she stopped the Arklow schooner in the Bay of Biscay. Captain Dowds, formerly principal of the Irish Nautical College, was captain of the schooner. The officer in charge of the boarding party was a pupil of Dowds. There was a pleasant reunion, then &quot;Mary B Mitchell&quot; resumed her voyage to Lisbon, and &quot;Scylla&quot; continued her search for blockade runners.

In September 1943 &quot;Scylla&quot; was part of the Support Carrier Force at the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche) but came home to refit for duty as an Escort Carrier Flagship in October, which lasted until April 1944. The Scylla was one of two Dido class cruisers fitted with, an Action Information Organisation (AIO) room (the other was HMS Royalist) to co-ordinate radar and intercept information. &quot;Scylla&quot; was the allotted RN flagship for the Normandy landings and the flagship for Vice Admiral Philip Vian and it was considered vital to all shipping and naval movements in the area, particularly that of coastal RN MTBs and enemy E boats, to prevent blue on blue incidents. She served off Normandy as flagship of the Eastern Task Force, for 18 days.

On 23 June 1944 &quot;Scylla&quot; was badly damaged by a mine and written off. Although towed to Portsmouth, she was not disposed of until 1950, after use as a target between 1948 and 1950. She arrived at Thos. W. Ward, (Barrow-in-Furness, UK) on 4 May 1950 for breaking up.

<text>Tattered Cover is a bookstore chain in Denver, Colorado. It was one of the largest independent bookstores in the United States. Tattered Cover is open seven days a week at all branches, hosts prominent book signings, and is known for its customer service. Together, the stores maintain an inventory of over half a million books. Its LoDo store houses an events space that can seat over 250 persons, while its East Colfax store can seat around 100.

==History==
Tattered Cover opened in 1971 in the Cherry Creek district of Denver as a small bookshop. The original owner was Stephen Cogil, an Aurora native who became a Bookstore Consultant. It was purchased in 1974 by Joyce Meskis. Between 1973 and 1983, it expanded seven times, and in 1986 it moved into and consolidated at a new location in the Cherry Creek neighborhood, which remained open for over 20 years.

A second location was renovated and opened for business in 1994 in Denver&#x27;s historic LoDo (lower downtown) district. In 1995, the Fourth Story Restaurant &amp; Bar opened at the Cherry Creek location. In November 2004, a third location opened in Highlands Ranch. In April 2015, that store relocated to Littleton. The Cherry Creek location closed in June 2006 and moved to the newly renovated, long-defunct Lowenstein Theatre on Elizabeth Street at East Colfax Avenue in Denver. The Fourth Story restaurant did not move to that location and closed in 2006.

Like many independent bookstores, Tattered Cover is a member of the American Booksellers Association, and Meskis served as president of that organization in the early 1990s. Meskis is a former board member of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression and is also the recipient of The William J. Brennan, Jr. Award from The Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, the PEN/Newman First Amendment Award, the Brandeis Award from Privacy International, and the American Library Association&#x27;s John Phillip Immroth Memorial Award for Intellectual Freedom.

Meskis announced the sale of the bookstore in 2015 to Len Vlahos and Kristen Gilligan. In December 2020, Vlahos and Gilligan sold the company to a group of investors led by David Back and Kwame Spearman.
On October 16, 2023, Tattered Cover filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and announced that three stores would close and 27 staff would be laid off. Sale to Barnes &amp; Noble was approved by a bankruptcy court in July 2024.

===Colorado Supreme Court case===
In 2000 the store resisted, on First Amendment grounds, a search warrant for records related to purchases made by a customer suspected of illegally manufacturing methamphetamine. The case made national news, and was eventually decided in the store&#x27;s favor by the Colorado Supreme Court. Investigators were attempting to establish a connection between a suspect and books found on his premises how to manufacture the drug. The purchase in question was later revealed to be of a book on Japanese calligraphy.

<text>Bless This House is a British sitcom that aired on ITV from 2 February 1971 to 22 April 1976, with a total of 65 episodes. Starring Sid James and Diana Coupland, it was created by Vince Powell and Harry Driver, but mainly written by other hands including Dave Freeman and Carla Lane. It was made for the ITV network by Thames Television. In 2004, &quot;Bless This House&quot; was ranked by a BBC poll as the 67th Best British Sitcom.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Bless This House&quot; centres on life in Howard Road, New Malden, where travelling stationery salesman Sid Abbott and his wife Jean live with their teenagers: Mike is fresh from art college and more pre-occupied with protests than finding a job; and trendy schoolgirl Sally. Mike is 18 and Sally is 16, at the series&#x27; start. Sid and Jean constantly battle to comprehend the new generation&#x27;s permissive ways and are usually out-of-touch. Their neighbours and best friends are Trevor Lewis and his wife Betty.

==Cast==
*Sidney James as Sid Abbott. Jean Abbott&#x27;s husband and an Arsenal F.C. fan. He likes to believe he is in control of his household, but finds he has to sneak out to go to the football or the public house. He often tries to avoid occasions he doesn&#x27;t want to attend, but this often backfires on him.
*Diana Coupland as Jean Abbott. Sid&#x27;s wife, who believes she can talk him into or out of anything. She always knows what he&#x27;s up to and sees through his schemes.
*Robin Stewart as Mike Abbott. Jean and Sid&#x27;s son, their firstborn. He is an artist but he always avoids employment because &quot;it&#x27;s a drag.&quot; 
*Sally Geeson as Sally Abbott. Jean and Sid&#x27;s daughter, Mike&#x27;s little sister. Sid and Jean constantly worry about her relationships with &quot;boys.&quot; She calls Sid &quot;Daddy&quot; and Jean &quot;Mummy.&quot; Sally married Bless This House producer William G. Stewart in 1976 and had two children during their 10 years of marriage. 
*Anthony Jackson as Trevor Lewis. The Abbotts&#x27; next-door neighbour and Sid&#x27;s best friend.
*Patsy Rowlands as Betty Lewis. Trevor&#x27;s wife and Jean&#x27;s best friend. Jean and Betty usually gang up on their husbands if they don&#x27;t do the right things.

==Production==
The show was produced and directed by William G. Stewart, later the host of Channel 4’s &quot;15 to 1&quot; game show, and had theme music written by Geoff Love. A comic strip version was also produced, written by Angus Allan and printed in TV comic &quot;Look-in&quot;. The first seven episodes were made in black-and-white due to the ITV colour strike. Every episode was recorded in Studio 1 at Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios.

The series ended abruptly on 26 April 1976, when just four days after 22 April 1976 broadcast of the 13th and final episode of the sixth series, Sid James collapsed on stage at the Sunderland Empire Theatre during a performance of &quot;The Mating Season&quot; after failing to respond to a cue. James had suffered a heart attack and later died on the way to the hospital.

At the time of James&#x27;s death, plans were in place for a seventh and eighth series of the show and a second feature film. Ironically, James had told his co-star Diana Coupland, &quot;it&#x27;s such fun and so successful, we&#x27;ll still be working on &quot;Bless This House&quot; till one of us kicks the bucket.&quot;

==Episodes==

==Home media==
===VHS===
===DVD===

The entire series of &quot;Bless This House&quot; is available on DVD. The first-ever set to appear on Region 2 in the UK was a DVD featuring the first colour episodes of the series from distribution company, Clear Vision. Completed series sets were made available via Network, between 2005 and 2007, followed by a complete series box set in 2007, which was repackaged in 2008 and again in 2009. The sets do not contain special features, aside from the series four set, which contains the Christmas television special, &quot;All This, and Christmas Too!&quot;, featuring Sid James, broadcast in 1971 and had not been aired since. Both complete series sets feature the 1972 feature film.

In Australia (Region 4), the series was originally released by Umbrella Entertainment, where both the first and second series were made available, each in two parts and are the only DVDs to include special features. The first three complete series were then released between 2009 and 2013. After which, no subsequent series had been released until a complete series set from Roadshow Entertainment in 2013, followed by a reissue from Via Vision Entertainment in 2020. As with the Region 2 complete sets, the Region 4 complete DVD sets contain the feature film.

ITV3 started repeating the series on 17 June 2020, with minor edits.

==Film==

A film version of the TV series was made in 1972. While it still starred Diana Coupland and Sid James as the Abbotts, Robin Askwith, who had previously appeared in the TV series, played Mike instead of TV series regular Robin Stewart due to the latter being unable to find time to appear in the film, having already been booked for the summer season on Bournemouth Pier. In addition, it featured &quot;new&quot; neighbours played by Terry Scott and June Whitfield. June later guest starred in an episode of the regular series, although as a different character. The part of Trevor was also recast with Peter Butterworth replacing Jackson. All the original actors returned for series three. Additionally, Mike gets married at the end of the film; this had no effect on the storylines in the television series.

<doc id="999146" wikidata="Q7811651" url="?curid=999146" title="Tobias Mealey">
<text>Tobias Gilmore &quot;T.G.&quot; Mealey (August 5, 1823 – April 27, 1904) was a Canadian-born American entrepreneur, politician, and early settler of Minnesota. He grew up in New Brunswick, made his fortune in the California Gold Rush, and became an influential figure upon settling in Monticello, Minnesota. He served in both houses of the Minnesota Legislature between 1873 and 1882. The Tobias G. Mealey House, his 1855 home in Monticello, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Early years==
Tobias Mealey was born in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada, in 1823 and was educated in the common school system. He engaged in farm labor and lumbering for a few years, then entered the retail trade at age 22. In 1849 he joined the California Gold Rush, where he put his hand to mining, retail, construction, and lumbering. In 1852 he returned to New Brunswick with $25,000 in gold. On the way he passed through Minnesota and liked what he saw there. In 1855 he married Catherine Prescott and together they emigrated to Minnesota. Saint Paul was too well established for him and Minneapolis had yet to come into prominence, so Mealey opted to settle in Monticello, then still called Moritzious. He sited their house on a hill away from the Mississippi riverfront to get away from the saloons, boatmen, and lumberjacks he found too raucous.

==Business and politics==
During his first year in Monticello, Mealey purchased an interest in a sawmill and opened a general store. In addition to hardware, groceries, footwear, and carpet, it was at the time the only store in Monticello to sell clothing. He soon sold both businesses and engaged in farming, but bought back into the general store in 1863. Later he developed business interests in a starch factory and a clothespin factory. His son S.J. joined him in running the general store. The elder Mealey forged connections with other influential Minnesotans, selling land to streetcar entrepreneur Thomas Lowry for a summer home and becoming close friends with railroad magnate James J. Hill.

Active in politics, Mealey served as a justice of the peace and a probate judge in Wright County. Previously identifying as a Republican, he followed 1872 presidential candidate Horace Greeley into the breakaway Liberal Republican Party as he ran for and won election to the Minnesota House of Representatives. Running thereafter as a Democrat, he won election the following year to the Minnesota Senate, serving in the 1874 and 1875 legislatures. He declined a nomination to run again in the 1875 election, but was a delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention and returned as a state senate candidate in 1877. He won, but in 1878 Minnesota switched to four-year terms for senators, sending him into another election that November. He was reelected and served through 1882. During his term he was instrumental in passing a new tax code that so improved on prior law it was known as the &quot;iron-clad tax law&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tobias Mealey married Catherine Prescott in New Brunswick in 1855. The couple had two sons and three daughters in Minnesota, enlarging their Monticello home several times to accommodate their growing family. In 1884 their daughter Susan married Rufus Rand, then vice-president of the Minneapolis Gas Light Company. As a wedding gift, the Mealeys gave the couple a large lot next to their own, upon which Susan designed the 30-room Rand House as a summer home. James J. Hill had a railroad spur constructed nearby for the convenience of his friend&#x27;s wedding guests.

Tobias Mealey died in 1904, whereupon Catherine moved in with one of their daughters. Their son S.J. ran the Mealey general store, as well as the starch factory (which had become a leading local business) and the Monticello post office. He went on to serve as president of the Monticello State Bank, president of the Monticello Preserving Company, and manager of the Monticello Mill and Elevator, and was credited as one of the leading businessmen in Wright County.

<text>Markfield Road Pumping Station, now known as Markfield Beam Engine and Museum or sometimes just as Markfield Beam Engine is a Grade II listed building containing a beam engine, originally built in 1886 to pump sewage from Tottenham towards the Beckton Works. The grounds of the building now form a public park known as Markfield Park. The River Moselle joins the River Lea at this location.
==Markfield Beam Engine==

Markfield Beam Engine is a free-standing steam engine with a flywheel that moves a beam. The beam drives two single-acting plunger pumps. Each pump is 26 inches in diameter and has a 51-inch stroke. When the machine was operational it had a working speed of 16 rpm and each pump could move a day.

The engine is finely decorated, with doric style columns and acanthus leaves.

==History==

The sewage works opened in 1864, The scheme was led by the Tottenham and Wood Green Drainage Board, and was connected to the London County Council drainage system and the Northern Outfall Sewer. The current beam engine was built by Wood Brothers of Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, in 1886 and commissioned in 1888, replacing an earlier 45 horsepower beam engine. It is the only surviving Wood Brothers eight column engine in situ. It was used continuously from its installation until 1905, when it was relegated to occasional duty for stormwater pumping. The works were finally closed for operation in February 1964, having been replaced by Deephams Sewage Treatment Works in Edmonton.

In 1970, the River Lee Regional Park Authority took a lease on the engine house, and a group of volunteers took on the task of restoring the engine, coming together as the River Lee Industrial Archaeology Society. The engine house and engine were Grade II listed in 1974. Markhouse Beam Engine and Museum was formed in 1984.

Over £3 million has been spent on restoring the engine, building and surrounding grounds, a full restoration of the park was completed by April 2010, and the park, museum, and beam engine re-opened for public access. The funding was secured through various sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund, Football Foundation, DCLG and Big Lottery Fund. The museum is open on Sundays and Bank Holidays, and the engine is now occasionally run for public display.

<doc id="999166" wikidata="Q683785" url="?curid=999166" title="Rick McCallum">
<text>Richard McCallum (born August 22, 1954) is an American film producer. He is mostly known for his work on &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; as well as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Special Editions and Prequel Trilogy. He is best known for his frequent collaborations with American filmmaker George Lucas, though he was also a long-time producer for British television playwright Dennis Potter, most notably on &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; and &quot;Dreamchild.&quot;

==Early career and collaboration with Dennis Potter==
McCallum&#x27;s career as producer began with &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981), the film version of the 1978 BBC TV drama, for director Herbert Ross and writer Dennis Potter. After the commercial failure of the film, Potter invited McCallum to go to work in England. During the 1980s, McCallum&#x27;s work with Potter included producing the films &quot;Dreamchild&quot; (1985), an unusual exploration by Potter of the creation of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, which was nominated for two BAFTA awards, and &quot;Track 29&quot; directed by Nicolas Roeg; executive producing the landmark BBC-TV series &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;; and in 1989 producing the Potter-directed TV series &quot;Blackeyes&quot;.

During the 1980s, McCallum also produced movies with filmmakers including David Hare (&quot;Strapless&quot;); Neil Simon (&quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;); Harvey Fierstein, whose HBO film &quot;Tidy Endings&quot; received two CableACE Awards; and Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Castaway&quot;. McCallum also produced the music video for the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Undercover of the Night&quot;, directed by Julien Temple.

==Collaboration with George Lucas==
He first met George Lucas on the set of &quot;Dreamchild&quot;.

===&quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;===
Several years after their first meeting, Lucas was preparing his first weekly live-action television program, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, and turned to McCallum to produce the ambitious series, which was to be shot in 35 countries. With a unique perspective on the eventful early life of Indiana Jones – including its cinematic qualities, an emphasis on storytelling and characters, and an enticing promise of new adventures each week – McCallum helped attract a stellar list of writers and actors to the creative ranks of the series. Among the directors with whom McCallum worked on the series were Bille August, Nicolas Roeg, David Hare, Mike Newell, Deepa Mehta, Terry Jones, Gavin Millar, Simon Wincer, and Carl Schultz. During its run, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences honored &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; with 12 Emmy Awards from 27 nominations. The series debuted on DVD in 2007, and McCallum served alongside Lucas as a joint executive producer on a series of 94 acclaimed documentaries that accompany the episodes and illuminate the real-life history behind their stories.

===&quot;Radioland Murders&quot;===
When &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; ended, McCallum produced &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994), for which Lucas served as executive producer and the originator of the story.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
During production of &quot;Radioland Murders&quot;, Lucas confided to McCallum his plans for three new &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. To further test the nascent digital technology just then becoming available, in part from developments they made on Young Indiana Jones, McCallum produced revised versions of A New Hope, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; – released in 1997 as the Special Editions.

Assembling the teams that worked both in front of and behind the cameras, McCallum produced the next three films, which Lucas wrote and directed: &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). The &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels also ushered in a new era of digital filmmaking, and McCallum played a leading role in its development, overseeing a team of creative and technical professionals that developed and created the industry&#x27;s first all-digital production pipeline. McCallum makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; near the end of the film when Palpatine arrives on Naboo.

===&quot;Red Tails&quot;===
McCallum was one of the producers of &quot;Red Tails&quot;, an action-adventure movie on which Lucas was executive producer, that pays tribute to the spirit of World War II&#x27;s Tuskegee Airmen. The movie was released nationally in the U.S. on January 20, 2012.

===Retirement from Lucasfilm===
Following Lucasfilm&#x27;s announced acquisition by The Walt Disney Company, on October 31, 2012, ForceCast.net podcast Lucasfilm&#x27;s Steve Sansweet stated that &quot;Rick has retired from Lucasfilm&quot;. He had been involved with a potential live-action series set within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, but the show was put on hold in 2010 due to budget concerns.

==Post-Lucasfilm career==
After leaving Lucasfilm, McCallum settled in Prague in Czechia. His Prague-based company, Film United, develops film projects and provides production services for Czech and European feature films. Films that McCallum is developing include &quot;R&#x27;ha&quot;, a science fiction feature film based on an earlier short film, to be directed by Kaleb Lechowski and written by Matthew Graham; &quot;In the Fog&quot;, a World War II film by Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa; &quot;So Far So Good&quot; (&quot;Zatím dobrý&quot;), based on the novel by Jan Novák about the Mašín brothers; and (as executive producer) &quot;A Long Way Home&quot;, directed by Paki Smith and written by Alex Rose.

==Personal life==
McCallum&#x27;s mother, photographer Pat York, is married to actor Michael York. His father, Roy Alwood McCallum, was a US military pilot.
McCallum&#x27;s daughter, Olivia &#x27;Mousy&#x27; McCallum, also works in the film industry.

<text>The Tày people, also known as the Thổ, T&#x27;o, Tai Tho, Ngan, Phen, Thu Lao, or Pa Di, is a Central Tai-speaking ethnic group who live in northern Vietnam. According to a 2019 census, there are 1.8 million Tày people living in Vietnam. This makes them the second largest ethnic group in Vietnam after the majority Kinh (Vietnamese) ethnic group. Most live in northern Vietnam in the Cao Bằng, Lạng Sơn, Bắc Kạn, Thái Nguyên, and Quảng Ninh provinces, along the valleys and the lower slopes of the mountains. They also live in some regions of the Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces. They inhabit fertile plains and are generally agriculturalists, mainly cultivating rice. They also cultivate maize, and sweet potato among other things.

==History==
The Tày were once known as the Thổ people. is derived from Chinese (), which means &#x27;land&#x27; and &#x27;local&#x27;. Although not inherently a pejorative it was often used as such in practice (cf. &quot;bumpkin&quot;) in both Vietnam and China. Under the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Thổ was deemed a pejorative and substituted with Tày.

The Tày are closely related to the Nùng people and Zhuang people, who they are culturally and linguistically almost indistinguishable from. Although they are considered an indigenous group, portions of their population likely originated in China during the 11th and 12th centuries. However unlike the Nùng, they were more heavily Vietnamized due to their closer proximity to the Kinh and shared similar cultural practices with the Vietnamese such as lacquering their teeth black. By 1900 around 30% of their language was made of Vietnamese loan words.

Tày customs were altered greatly due to Vietnamese and Confucian patriarchal structures, however some customs persisted. Polygamy with multiple equal wives and legitimacy of issue was practiced. Marriage was preferred to occur within the clan. Young wives lived with their parents until giving birth to their first child. Tày women, like those of the Nùng and Zhuang, were said to have used poison to seek revenge when wronged.

The Tày and Nùng often intermarried, although the Tày seem to have held higher status in these relationships. Tày men married Nùng women more often than the other way around. Some Nùng groups were probably absorbed by the Tày.

==Religion==

The majority of the Tày practices &quot;Then&quot;, an indigenous religion involving the worship of tutelary gods, gods of the natural environment, and ancestors and progenitors of human groups. The patterns of this religion are inherited from Taoism and the Chinese folk religion: the god of the universe is the Jade Emperor, in some local traditions (for example in the Quảng Hoà district of Cao Bằng) also identified as the Yellow Emperor (). For their religious ceremonies they used to be able to recite Chinese characters but now along with the characters they use glosses because many of them can&#x27;t recite anymore due to the fact that Vietnamese schools don&#x27;t teach Chinese characters.

An altar for the ancestors is usually placed in a central location in the house. The altar room is considered sacred; guests and women who have given birth are not allowed to sit on the bed in front of the altar.

Some Tày have adopted Mahayana Buddhism under the influence of Vietnamese and Chinese culture.

==Language==
The Tày people speak the Tày language, among other Tai dialects of the Kra–Dai languages. Literacy in their own language is quite low among Tày people, probably around 5% or less. Dialects include Central Tày, Eastern Tày, Southern Tày, Northern Tày, Tày Trung Khanh, Thu Lao, and Tày Bao Lac, Tày Binh Lieu. There is a continuum of dialects to southern Zhuang in China.

== Tày-ized Vietnamese among the Tày ==
A part of the modern-day Tày population encompasses Tày-ized Vietnamese who live mainly in what is now Lang Son. These Tày-ized Vietnamese have their origins traced back to the Vietnamese living further south in the deltas of the Ca, Ma, and Red Rivers, e.g. Nghe An, Nam Dinh, etc. dispatched to the Sino-Annamese border by Annamese imperial governments to serve as governmental officials and local leaders (&quot;phiên thần thổ ty&quot;). These people were then forbidden to return to their home areas. Eventually they got assimilated into the indigenous Tày surrounding population. Their common surnames include &quot;Vi&quot;, &quot;Nguyễn Đình&quot;, &quot;Nguyễn Khắc&quot;, &quot;Nguyễn Công&quot;, &quot;Hoàng Đức&quot;, &quot;Hoàng Đình&quot;, etc. This practice started in the 15th century and ended in the early 20th century. Vi Văn Định is an example of these Tày-ized Vietnamese in the 20th century.

<doc id="999186" wikidata="Q339027" url="?curid=999186" title="Santalum">
<text>Santalum is a genus of woody flowering plants in the Santalaceae family, the best known and commercially valuable of which is the Indian sandalwood tree, &quot;S. album&quot;. Members of the genus are trees or shrubs. Most are root parasites which photosynthesize their own food, but tap the roots of other species for water and inorganic nutrients. Several species, most notably &quot;S. album&quot;, produce highly aromatic wood, used for scents and perfumes and for herbal medicine. About 25 known species range across the Indomalayan, Australasian, and Oceanian realms, from India through Malesia to the Pacific Islands, as far as Hawaii and the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of South America.

Indian sandalwood (&quot;S. album&quot;) is found in the tropical dry deciduous forests of India, the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and Arnhem Land of northern Australia. It is the only species of the genus found on the Asian mainland, and may have been introduced to India from the Lesser Sundas centuries ago. Indian sandalwood has been stripped from most of India&#x27;s forests, and is now rare in the wild. Five species, including &quot;S. album&quot;, are native to Australia. &quot;S. acuminatum&quot;, known as the sweet quandong or native peach, produces a shiny bright red fruit used increasingly in Australia for jams, jellies, chutneys, and pies. Four species, commonly called &quot;iliahi&quot;, are endemic to Hawaii. &quot;S. fernandezianum&quot;, endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile, was also overexploited for its aromatic wood, and may now be extinct.

&quot;Santalum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;.
==Cultivation==
The initial challenges to cultivating &quot;Santalum&quot; are numerous, not only due to its germination and growth needs, but also the amount of growing time required for the tree to properly mature. Germination of &quot;Santalum&quot; seeds is not completely understood. Seeds cannot be effectively stored, and must be planted upon harvesting them from a fruiting tree. Even in doing this, the seeds may not germinate. As such, growing saplings can be quite labour-intensive.

Furthermore, although &quot;Santalum&quot; trees photosynthesize on their own, the trees are hemiparasitic, with roots that seek out and tap the root systems of surrounding trees for water and nutrients. As such, each sapling is usually grown next to four or five host trees. Pruning of host trees is also needed at times, since &quot;Santalum&quot; trees require much sunlight for growth.

To produce commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils, the trees have to be at least 40 years of age, but 80 or above is preferred. As such, those who begin cultivation of &quot;Santalum&quot; likely will not live to reap the rewards of their work. However, inferior sandalwood that has been cut or toppled at 30 years old can still fetch a decent price due to the demand for real sandalwood.

Beyond these initial difficulties, growing sandalwood is not difficult, since it becomes more resistant to environmental stresses, pests, and diseases as it matures.

Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.

<text>.ad is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Andorra. It is administered by Andorra Telecom.

== History ==
.ad was originally only for Andorran registrants or trademark holders and each registration had to be pre-approved. 

In 2024 the registry relaunched the TLD and revised all policies. Since 22 May 2024 it is a requirement to use an accredited registrar. 

Before that date, registrants could buy domains directly from the registry, which was discontinued. 

Since 22 October 2024 the registration policies were changed so that any natural or legal person worldwide can register a domain name under .ad. 

Additionally, domains are not subject to prior validation anymore and are instead processed immediately. Registrars outside of Andorra are also able to accredit themselves since then.

== Domain hack ==
Because .ad is an abbreviation for the word advertisement or advert, .ad has also been used in an unconventional manner as a domain hack by some advertising media.

<text>Evergreen Cemetery is a cemetery in Juneau, the capital of the U.S. state of Alaska. It was established in 1887 to replace the older cemetery on Chicken Ridge, near Main Street, when that location was staked as a gold mine. Most of the graves in this older cemetery were moved to the new cemetery between 1889 and 1892 and the rest were moved in about 1915. The grounds were deeded by Evergreen Cemetery Association to the City of Juneau on May 23, 1907.

Evergreen Cemetery is operated by the Juneau Department of Parks and Recreation, and was Juneau&#x27;s main cemetery from 1887 until Alaskan Memorial Park in Mendenhall Valley opened in the 1970s.

<doc id="999197" wikidata="Q37239" url="?curid=999197" title=".ae">
<text>.ae is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for the United Arab Emirates. It is administered by .aeDA which is part of the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority of UAE (TDRA).

The internationalized country code top-level domain in the Arabic alphabet of the UAE is امارات., which is represented as codice_1 in Punycode.

==Second and third level domain registrations==
The domain codice_2 is administered by the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority of UAE (TDRA).
Registrations are permitted directly at the second level (unrestricted zone) or at the third level (restricted zone) beneath several category labels. During 1995–2003 co.ae was used for commercial entities, but this has been deprecated by UAEnic in 2003 in preference to the commercial use of second-level registrations; existing co.ae registrations were allowed to be retained if their registrants so desire. During 2008 when ae was re-delegated to the TRA, the .aeDA published new policies in which co.ae was introduced only for local commercial companies provided that the name is connected to the business name.

==Re-delegation of .ae==
The .AE domain was originally delegated to UUNET. Recognising the domain should be administered in the country, the domain was transferred in 1995 to Etisalat, following a brief period of administration by the United Arab Emirates University. Since that time, Etisalat, through its division the UAE Network Information Center (UAEnic), has been responsible for the operation of the .ae domain.

During GITEX 2006, TDRA announced that the .ae ccTLD management and operations will be re-delegated to TDRA from Etisalat/UAEnic, the current .ae ccTLD manager. A new entity called .ae Domain Administration (.aeDA) has been formed to take care of management and operations of .ae based on latest DNS and Domain Registry technologies. During January 2008, IANA officially re-delegated the .ae Domain to the TDRA.

On 3 August 2008, the .aeDA took over the DNS and launched their services with the new registry system which supports registry–registrar model. Currently the .aeDA has accredited eight registrars from different parts of the world. For the first time, Internet users in the UAE will be able to register and manage their domain names under .ae automatically using an online system without going through manual process which used to take up to six weeks for domain registrations. As per .aeDA policies, current domain holders are allowed to transfer between registrars at no cost.

.ae was the first ccTLD in the Arab region to use the standard Registry-Registrar model. As well, .aeDA is the first registry in the region to use the industry-standard Extensible Provisioning Protocol to manage its domains.

==Accredited registrars==
As of 6 December 2020, there are 22 accredited registrars:
* Lexsynergy
* Etisalat
* Du
* Ascio
* Instra Corporation
* Mark Monitor
* Corporation Service Company (Singapore)
* BUZINESSWARE
* AEserver
* InterNetworX
* CPS-Datensysteme
* Safenames
* Internetx
* 101Domain
* Host Arabia t/a Tasjeel.ae
* Abu-Ghazaleh
* Marcaria
* BB-Online
* DREAMSCAPE
* EPAG

==Transfer between registrars==
Registrants (domain name holders) can transfer their domains from one registrar to another provided that they obtain a domain name password. Domain name passwords can be recovered online through .aeDA&#x27;s website password-recovery.aeda.net.ae. After obtaining this password, registrants can supply this password to the gaining registrar who will be able to transfer it directly without dealing with the losing registrar. Losing registrars are prohibited from charging a fee when a domain transfer occur; however gaining registrars may do so.

==Domain name pricing==
.ae domain name retail prices ranges from 30 USD to 200 USD depending on the provider and the level of support and services provided with the domain name.

The .ae registration prices have noticeably dropped since the introduction of .aeDA. Prior to 3 August 2008, .ae domains were offered by Etisalat for around 41 USD per year while ac.ae, org.ae, gov.ae and sch.ae were offered for around 20 USD per year. International providers used to charge around 100–200 USD in order to cover the administrative cost involved in the manual registration process.

After .aeDA&#x27;s go-live in August 2008, .ae registration price declined to as low as 30 USD with international registrars.

==Domain name count==
On 16-Sep-2012 aeDA made an announcement on reaching the 100,000 registration mark in domain names.
During Gitex2008, .aeDA domain name counter showed over 90,000 domain names currently held in the registry, 
making it the largest ccTLD registry in the Arab region. As of May 2023, there are more than 300,000+ domains in the zone.

==IDN and Arabic domain names==
On 2 March 2009, The UAE&#x27;s Ministerial Council for Services passed a proposal by the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority of UAE (TDRA) to register the domain address of &#x27;Emarat&#x27; in Arabic script (امارات) for the country&#x27;s Arabic domains, stating that the domain will contribute to increasing the number of Internet users visiting Arabic sites and further promote and strengthen the UAE&#x27;s identity.

During ICANN meeting no. 35 (21–26 June 2009) in Sydney, .aeDA representatives mentioned that aeDA&#x27;s EPP-based registry system is fully compatible with IDN protocols and guidelines.

In January 2010 ICANN announced that the UAE IDN ccTLD (DNS name: xn—mgbaam7a8h, امارات) was one of the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process.

==ENUM of UAE (+971)==
.aeDA, the registry operator of .ae is also the official operator for UAE ENUM Space (971). The ENUM space was redelegated from the incumbent operator Etisalat since 16 April 2009.

He studied music at school, won several talent competitions and played lead roles in musicals both at school and at PACE Youth Theatre. When his parents bought him a piano he discovered he had a talent for writing songs and taught himself to play. Sneddon was inspired by his father&#x27;s record collection of The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Van Morrison and in particular by Elton John. &quot;The person who has inspired me the most is Elton John,&quot; he said. &quot;I love the Beatles, but as I was growing up, I always wanted to play the piano like him. I&#x27;ve never had any lessons, so he has been my only teacher.&quot; He also drew inspirations for his music from Scottish 1980s artists such as Del Amitri, Deacon Blue and Simple Minds. Sneddon enjoyed performing in musicals from a young age. At Primary school, a teacher suggested a Youth drama group called PACE and he attended PACE for twelve years from the age of eight.

After attending the University of Paisley for just six months, Sneddon dropped out to pursue a career in music. He performed in musicals and sang with bands in Scotland for several years, while he continued working on his songwriting and sending off demos. He was offered a role in a musical in London, and a part in a young boy band called Arena. He presented &quot;Inside Out&quot;, a children&#x27;s show on Scottish TV.

While acting in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, he met John Kielty (Sneddon was Romeo and Kielty played Lord Capulet). After performing some acoustic nights together at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow in 2001, they decided to start a band and called themselves The Martians. The Martians busked and did shows during the Edinburgh Festival. Sneddon was performing with The Martians in 2002 when he decided to enter the BBC&#x27;s first series of &quot;Fame Academy&quot;. After David won the show he brought Kielty down to London to co-write his debut album and go on tour with him. Sneddon also played in the indie-rock band The Sham with Kielty in 2004 and 2005. Since then The Martians won the Highland Quest for a new musical in 2006 – &quot;The Sundowe&quot; was produced by Cameron Mackintosh and toured the Scottish Highlands in early 2007.

==Music career==

===&quot;Fame Academy&quot;===
Sneddon became known when he won the BBC&#x27;s first series of a reality TV music competition called &quot;Fame Academy&quot; in December 2002. He was not selected for the first show, but was drafted in as a replacement when one contestant, Naomi Roper, withdrew from the show due to laryngitis. With his high tenor voice and easy going, personable charm, Sneddon went on to become a favourite with both the audience and his fellow contestants. He won the final of the show winning the voters attention for his memorable versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; by Elton John, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; by Danny Whitten, and his own composition &quot;Stop Living the Lie&quot; and won the public vote with 3.5m votes.

Sneddon signed a record contract with Mercury Records and was given a luxury penthouse, Audi car and more as part of his prize. He filmed his music video for his first single at Abbey Road Studios. His first single &quot;Stop Living the Lie&quot;, was no. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 2003, and in the UK Top 40 for a full nine weeks. Sneddon is the only artist from a reality TV show to have a number one hit single with his own composition. He had three other UK Singles Chart hits with his compositions – &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; No. 3, &quot;Best of Order&quot; No. 19 and &quot;Baby Get Higher&quot; No. 38. &quot;Baby Get Higher&quot; has since been a hit on the dance floor for Almighty Records and a singles chart hit for Dutch singer VanVelzen.

Sneddon was given three months to write, rehearse and record original material for his debut album. &quot;Seven Years - Ten Weeks&quot; was released in April 2003, four months after he won the show, and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 5. The album contains all original compositions written by Sneddon, two co-writes with Scott MacAlister and four songs co-written with Martians&#x27; member Kielty. Sneddon wrote songs about his seven years after leaving university when he performed with bands, and on stage in Scotland – and about his ten weeks singing live on the BBC television series. It contains his three chart singles &quot;Stop Living the Lie&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; and &quot;Best of Order&quot;. The album was produced by Hugh Padgham, and was recorded with Elton John&#x27;s band. There was a Scottish album launch for the release on 27 April, when Sneddon performed seven gigs in ten hours all over Scotland. 

After the show he toured with a band that included James Bauer-Mein. David has continued working with Mein as a songwriting and music production partnership in London since 2003.

Throughout 2003, Sneddon and his band played a university tour, the Box Live and Summer XS tours, and headlined at the &#x27;Pop on the Rock&#x27; music festival in the Channel Islands. Highlights of the year were supporting Bryan Adams in Bristol and his musical hero, Elton John, in Hull. Sneddon also performed on TV many times, including the BBC&#x27;s chart music program Top of the Pops. David was also a guest presenter on The Saturday Show (BBC TV series) and the BBC Scotland Children in Need Appeal, and he took part in Avid Merrion&#x27;s comedy show &#x27;Bo Selecta&#x27; on Channel 4. In 2003 Sneddon and the show drew negative press from the UK tabloid media such as &quot;The Sun&quot;.
By the end of 2003, Sneddon then took the step of moving from being a popstar to working as a songwriter for other singers. He signed an exclusive publishing deal as a songwriter with Universal Music Group in October 2003. Sneddon&#x27;s main focus has always been his songwriting. He said &quot;&quot;I&#x27;ve loved all the music side of it, it&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be – the recording, the studio, writing, but the other stuff.&quot;...?&quot;

===Acoustic songs===
In 2004, Sneddon was songwriting in London when he formed a rock band called The Sham with John Kielty. They played gigs in London, Scotland and the North of England and headlined at the Hogmanay Celebrations in Aberdeen. The Sham included Jay Mein (bass), Ed Carlile (drums), Si Jones (guitar), Jake Gosling (keyboards) and John Kielty (guitar).

In 2006, Sneddon started writing and recording for a new solo album. In July he showcased his songs in a series of acoustic gigs with Kielty on guitar in London, Essex and Scotland. In an interview for FPR Radio in October 2006, he said &quot;It&#x27;s not what people are expecting, I&#x27;m trying something a bit different. The feedback, from people who know me from the show, on the new songs has been incredible.&quot;

From July 2006 to October 2007, he performed occasional gigs mostly in London – at the Bedford, the Regal Room, The Cobden and the Troubadour venues. When Kielty moved to America in late 2006, Sneddon brought in David Mullins as his backing guitarist. He also presented a radio sports show &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot; on BBC Radio Scotland in June 2007. Sneddon performed a few gigs in Scotland over this time at the Oran Mor, Dunstaffstage, the Jazz Bar and the Kilsyth festival.

Sneddon released a five-track acoustic EP, &quot;White Noise&quot;, in January 2007, his first recorded work for several years. It was recorded in &#x27;one live acoustic take&#x27; and included the songs &quot;White Noise&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Lady Lullaby&quot;, &quot;One Old Soul&quot; and &quot;Wish You Well&quot;.

He played gigs and festivals (with Mullins) across England and Scotland in 2007. In August 2007, he performed three sold-out gigs at the Jazz Bar Edinburgh Festival to good reviews. David&#x27;s songs Insomnia, Anticipation, One Old Soul and Scars proved popular with his fans.

Sneddon&#x27;s 2007 EP re-entered the top of the Indiestore chart in 2008 where it has stayed into 2010. In 2008, Sneddon played several gigs in London, while he continued with his songwriting work alongside guitarist James Bauer Mein. He describes his music as &#x27;melody driven pop&#x27;.

===Songwriting and production===
In October 2003, Sneddon&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Get Higher&quot; had reached No.39 in the UK Singles Chart, and the song achieved further chart successes in November 2003 when the dance label Almighty Records produced an exclusive promo remix which was a dance hit. The label then recorded a version featuring Belle Lawrence, which was included on several dance compilation albums. In November 2006, the song was also a singles chart hit for Dutch singer VanVelzen. In 2012, the singer Emin Agalarov from Azerbaijan also released &quot;Baby Get Higher&quot; as his first UK single from his &quot;After The Thunder&quot; album, and the song has received BBC Radio 2 A List airplay.

In 2005, Sneddon wrote the international hit &quot;The Message&quot; for UK soul singer Nate James, which was released as a single in the UK, and was on James&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Set The Tone&quot;. It charted in Italy and Japan in 2006. In 2009, Sneddon signed a new deal with music publisher Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Sneddon stated in the &quot;Paisley Daily Express&quot;, &quot;This deal has been in the pipeline for a year and we wanted to wait for the right deal. I don&#x27;t think there has been another reality TV winner who took a back step to this side of the industry but I like being able to get on with my work. We had to prove ourselves...and so that&#x27;s why we did a lot of development work.&quot; In 2008, Sneddon focused on his songwriting career while he also performed a few occasional gigs in London over this time. He signed in 2009 with new management Three Six Zero Group, which is now part of Roc Nation and to Sony/ATV Music Publishing in July 2009 as a songwriter.

==== The Nexus ====
In 2003, Sneddon worked with producer and guitarist James Bauer-Mein when touring and recording his debut album. Since then, Sneddon and Mein have formed a partnership, working together in a London recording studio discovering, producing and writing with new talent in both the US and the UK. Sneddon and Mein have built up strong reputations as songwriters, having written music chart songs for other artists such as Hurts, Morten Harket of A-ha, &quot;The X Factor&quot; winner Matt Cardle, Newton Faulkner and American singer Lana Del Rey. In 2009 they decided to call themselves &quot;The Nexus&quot;. For Cardle&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Letters&quot;, Sneddon and Bauer-Mein co-wrote the songs &quot;Letters&quot; and &quot;Slowly&quot; (co-written with Cardle and Eg White). The album was released in October 2011 and charted at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

In 2012, The Nexus were listed as the writers for the song &quot;Keep the Sun Away&quot; for Morten Harket, best known as the singer of the Norwegian synthpop/rock band A-ha, on his solo album &quot;Out of My Hands&quot; released April 2012.

It was revealed in January 2012 that Sneddon, as half of The Nexus, had co-written the song &quot;National Anthem&quot; for Lana Del Rey&#x27;s debut album &quot;Born to Die&quot; that was released in January 2012 and peaked at No.1 in the UK Albums Chart. They also co-wrote the song &quot;Driving in Cars With Boys&quot; with Del Rey.

Newton Faulkner&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Write It on Your Skin&quot;, which contained two Nexus songs – &quot;Pick Up Your Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;Feel&quot; – was released in July 2012 and reached No.1 UK Albums Chart. As well as developing their own artists in 2012, Sneddon and Mein worked with Greyson Chance, Eliza Doolittle, and Dionne Bromfield. He is one of the more successful graduates from a reality TV show and has built a long career in the music business.

American pop singer Greyson Chance&#x27;s single &quot;Sunshine and City Lights&quot; (on his &quot;Truth Be Told Part 1&quot; EP), was co-written with The Nexus during a late session. &quot;American Idol&quot; runner-up finalist David Archuleta&#x27;s single release &quot;Don&#x27;t Run Away&quot; was produced by The Nexus and serviced to the AC Radio format.

<text>The Mandan are a Native American tribe of the Great Plains who have lived for centuries primarily in what is now North Dakota. They are enrolled in the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. About half of the Mandan still reside in the area of the reservation; the rest reside around the United States and in Canada.

The Mandan historically lived along both banks of the Upper Missouri River and two of its tributaries—the Heart and Knife rivers—in present-day North and South Dakota. Speakers of Mandan, a Siouan language, they developed a settled, agrarian culture. They established permanent villages featuring large, round, earth lodges, some in diameter, surrounding a central plaza. Matrilineal families lived in the lodges. The Mandan were a great trading nation, trading especially their large corn surpluses with other tribes in exchange for bison meat and fat. Food was the primary item, but they also traded for horses, guns, and other trade goods.

==Population==
The Mandan population was 3,600 in the early 18th century. It is estimated to have been 10,000–15,000 before European encounter. Decimated by a widespread smallpox epidemic in 1781, the people had to abandon several villages, and remnants of the Hidatsa also gathered with them in a reduced number of villages. In 1836, there were more than 1,600 full-blood Mandans but, following another smallpox epidemic in 1836–37, this number was estimated to have dropped to 125 by 1838.

In the 20th century, the people began to recover. In the 1990s, 6,000 people were enrolled in the Three Affiliated Tribes. In the 2010 Census, 1,171 people reported Mandan ancestry. Some 365 of them identified as full-bloods, and 806 had partial Mandan ancestry.

==Etymology==

The English name &quot;Mandan&quot; is derived from the French-Canadian explorer Pierre Gaultier, Sieur de la Verendrye, who in 1738 heard it as &quot;Mantannes&quot; from his Assiniboine guides, which call the Mandan &quot;Mayádąna&quot;. He had previously heard the earth lodge peoples referred to by the Cree as &quot;Ouachipouennes&quot;, &quot;the Sioux who go underground&quot;. The Assiniboine are Siouan speakers. Nearby Siouan speakers had exonyms similar to &quot;Mantannes&quot; in their languages, for instance, Teton &quot;Miwáthaŋni&quot; or &quot;Miwátąni&quot;, Yanktonai &quot;Miwátani&quot;, Yankton &quot;Mawátani&quot; or &quot;Mąwátanį&quot;, Dakota &quot;Mawátąna&quot; or &quot;Mawátadą&quot;, etc.

The Mandan have used differing autonyms to refer to themselves: Numakaki (Nųmą́khų́·ki) (or Rųwą́ʔka·ki) (&quot;many men, people&quot;) was inclusive and not limited to a specific village or band. This name was used before the smallpox epidemic of 1837–1838. Nueta (Nų́ʔetaa), the name used after this epidemic (&quot;ourselves, our people&quot;) was originally the name of Mandan villagers living on the west bank of the Missouri River.

The Mandan probably used &quot;Nųmą́khų́·ki / Rųwą́ʔka·ki&quot; to refer to a general tribal entity. Later, this word fell to disuse and instead two divisions&#x27; names were used, &quot;Nuweta&quot; or &quot;Ruptare&quot; (i.e., Mandan &quot;Nų́ʔetaa&quot; or &quot;Rų́ʔeta&quot;). Later, the term &quot;Nų́ʔetaa / Rų́ʔeta&quot; was extended to refer to a general tribal entity. The name &quot;Mi-ah´ta-nēs&quot; recorded by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1862 reportedly means &quot;people on the river bank&quot;, but this may be a folk etymology.

Various other terms and alternate spellings that occur in the literature include: Mayátana, Mayátani, Mąwádanį, Mąwádąδį, Huatanis, Mandani, Wahtani, Mantannes, Mantons, Mendanne, Mandanne, Mandians, Maw-dân, Meandans, les Mandals, Me-too´-ta-häk, Numakshi, Rųwą́&#x27;kši, Wíhwatann, Mevatan, Mevataneo. Gloria Jahoda in &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; states that they also call themselves the &quot;Pheasant people.&quot; George Catlin said the Mandans (or &quot;See-pohs-kah-nu-mah-kah-kee&quot;, &quot;people of the pheasants&quot;, as they call themselves)

==Language==
The Mandan language or &quot;Nų́ų́ʔetaa íroo&quot; belongs to the Siouan language family. It was initially thought to be closely related to the languages of the Hidatsa and the Crow. However, since the Mandan language has been in contact with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured. For this reason, linguists classify Mandan most often as a separate branch of the Siouan family.

Mandan has two main dialects: &quot;Nuptare&quot; and &quot;Nuetare&quot;. Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the University of Utah has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. , there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive. , programs in local schools encourage students&#x27; learning the language.

The Mandan and their language received much attention from European Americans, in part because their lighter skin color caused speculation they were of European origin. In the 1830s, Prince Maximilian of Wied spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and additionally prepared a comparison list of Mandan and Welsh words (he thought that the Mandan may have been displaced Welsh). The theory of the Mandan–Welsh connection was also supported by George Catlin, but researchers have found no evidence of such ancestry.

Mandan has different grammatical forms that depend on the sex of the addressee. Questions asked of men must use the suffix &quot;-oʔša&quot; while the suffix &quot;-oʔrą&quot; is used when asking of women. Likewise the indicative suffix is &quot;-oʔs&quot; when addressing men and &quot;-oʔre&quot; when addressing women, and also for imperatives: &quot;-ta&quot; (male), &quot;-rą&quot; (female). Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of sound symbolism in their vocabulary. A sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, denotes medium-ness, denotes largeness/greater intensity:

* &quot;síre&quot; &quot;yellow&quot;
* &quot;šíre&quot; &quot;tawny&quot;
* &quot;xíre&quot; &quot;brown&quot;
* &quot;sró&quot; &quot;tinkle&quot;
* &quot;xró&quot; &quot;rattle&quot;

==History==
===Origins and early history===
The exact origins and early history of the Mandan are unknown. Early studies by linguists gave evidence that the Mandan language may have been closely related to the language of the Ho-Chunk or Winnebago people of present-day Wisconsin. Scholars theorize the Mandans&#x27; ancestors may have settled in the Wisconsin area at one time. This idea is possibly confirmed in their oral history, which refers to their having come from an eastern location near a lake.

Some Ethnologists and scholars studying the Mandan subscribe to the theory that, like other Siouan-speaking people (possibly including the Hidatsa), they originated in the area of the mid-Mississippi River and the Ohio River valleys in present-day Ohio. If this was the case, the Mandan would have migrated north into the Missouri River Valley and its tributary the Heart River in present-day North Dakota. That is where Europeans first encountered the historical tribe. This migration is believed to have occurred possibly as early as the 7th century but probably between 1000 CE and the 13th century, after the cultivation of maize was adopted. It was a period of a major climatic shift, creating warmer, wetter conditions that favored their agricultural production.

After their arrival on the banks of the Heart River, the Mandan constructed several villages, the largest of which were at the mouth of the river. Archeological evidence and ground imaging radar have revealed changes in the defensive boundaries of these villages over time. The people built new ditches and palisades circumscribing smaller areas as their populations reduced.

What was known as Double Ditch Village was located on the east bank of the Missouri River, north of where present-day Bismarck developed. It was occupied by the Rupture Mandan for nearly 300 years. Today the site has depressions that are evidence of their lodges and smaller ones where they created cache pits to store dehydrated corn. The name comes from two defensive trenches built outside the area of the lodges. Construction of the fortifications here and at other locations along the Missouri has been found to have correlated to periods of drought, when peoples would have raided each other for food.

At some point during this time, the Hidatsa people also moved into the region. They also spoke a Siouan language. Mandan tradition states that the Hidatsa were a nomadic tribe until their encounter with the Mandan, who taught them to build stationary villages and cultivate agriculture. The Hidatsa continued to maintain amicable relations with the Mandan and constructed villages north of them on the Knife River.

Later the Pawnee and Arikara moved from the Republican River north along the Missouri River. They were Caddoan language speakers, and the Arikara were often early competitors with the Mandan, although both were horticulturalists. They built a settlement known as Crow Creek village on a bluff above the Missouri. The modern town of Chamberlain, South Dakota developed about eleven miles south of here.

The Mandan were divided into bands. The Nup&#x27;tadi (does not translate) was the largest linguistic group. The other bands were the Is&#x27;tope (&quot;those who tattooed themselves&quot;), Ma&#x27;nana&#x27;r (&quot;those who quarreled&quot;), Nu&#x27;itadi (&quot;our people&quot;), and the Awi&#x27;ka-xa / Awigaxa (does not translate). The &quot;Nup&#x27;tadi&quot; and &quot;Nu&#x27;itadi&quot; lived on both banks of the Missouri River, while the Awigaxa lived further upstream at the Painted Woods.

The bands all practiced extensive farming, which was carried out by the women, including the drying and processing of corn. The Mandan-Hidatsa settlements, called the &quot;Marketplace of the Central Plains&quot;, were major hubs of trade in the Great Plains Indian trading networks. Crops were exchanged, along with other goods that traveled from as far as the Pacific Northwest Coast. Investigation of their sites on the northern Plains have revealed items traceable as well to the Tennessee River, Florida, the Gulf Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard.

The Mandan gradually moved upriver, and consolidated in present-day North Dakota by the fifteenth century. From 1500 to about 1782, the Mandan reached the height of their population and influence. Their villages showed increasing densities as well as stronger fortifications, for instance at Huff Village. It had 115 large lodges with more than 1,000 residents.

The bands did not often move along the river until the late 18th century, after their populations plummeted due to smallpox and other epidemics.

===European encounter===
The Koatiouak, mentioned in a 1736 letter by Jesuit Jean-Pierre Aulneau, are identified as Mandans. Aulneau was killed before his planned expedition to visit the Mandans could take place.

The first European known to visit the Mandan was the French Canadian trader Sieur de la Verendrye in 1738. The Mandans carried him into their village, whose location is unknown. It is estimated that at the time of his visit, 15,000 Mandan resided in the nine well-fortified villages on the Heart River; the villages held a total of 1,000 lodges. According to Vérendrye, the Mandans at that time were a large, powerful, prosperous nation who were able to dictate trade on their own terms. They traded with other Native Americans both from the north and the south, from downriver.

Horses were acquired by the Mandan in the mid-18th century from the Apache to the South. The Mandan used them both for transportation, to carry packs and pull travois, and for hunting. The horses helped with the expansion of Mandan hunting territory on to the Plains. The encounter with the French from Canada in the 18th century created a trading link between the French and Native Americans of the region; the Mandan served as middlemen in the trade in furs, horses, guns, crops, and buffalo products. Spanish merchants and officials in St. Louis (after France had ceded its territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain in 1763) explored the Missouri and strengthened relations with the Mandan (whom they called &quot;Mandanas&quot;).

They wanted to discourage trade in the region by the English and the Americans, but the Mandan carried on open trade with all competitors. They were not going to be limited by the maneuvering of the Europeans. French traders in St. Louis also sought to establish direct overland communication between Santa Fé and their city; the fur trading Chouteau brothers gained a Spanish monopoly on trade with Santa Fe.

A smallpox epidemic broke out in Mexico City in 1779/1780. It slowly spread northward through the Spanish empire, by trade and warfare, reaching the northern plains in 1781. The Comanche and Shoshone had become infected and carried the disease throughout their territory. Other warring and trading peoples also became infected. The Mandan lost so many people that the number of clans was reduced from thirteen to seven; three clan names from villages west of the Missouri were lost altogether. They eventually moved northward about 25 miles, and consolidated into two villages, one on each side of the river, as they rebuilt following the epidemic. Similarly afflicted, the much reduced Hidatsa people joined them for defense. Through and after the epidemic, they were raided by Lakota Sioux and Crow warriors.

In 1796 the Mandan were visited by the Welsh explorer John Evans, who was hoping to find proof that their language contained Welsh words. Numerous European Americans held that there were Welsh Indians in these remote areas, a persistent myth that was widely written about. Evans had arrived in St. Louis two years prior, and after being imprisoned for a year, was hired by Spanish authorities to lead an expedition to chart the upper Missouri. Evans spent the winter of 1796–97 with the Mandan but found no evidence of any Welsh influence. In July 1797 he wrote to Dr. Samuel Jones, &quot;Thus having explored and charted the Missurie for 1,800 miles and by my Communications with the Indians this side of the Pacific Ocean from 35 to 49 degrees of Latitude, I am able to inform you that there is no such People as the Welsh Indians.&quot;

British and French Canadians from the north carried out more than twenty fur-trading expeditions down to the Hidatsa and Mandan villages in the years 1794 to 1800.

By 1804 when Lewis and Clark visited the tribe, the number of Mandan had been greatly reduced by smallpox epidemics and warring bands of Assiniboine, Lakota and Arikara. (Later they joined with the Arikara in defense against the Lakota.) The nine villages had consolidated into two villages in the 1780s, one on each side of the Missouri. But they continued their famous hospitality, and the Lewis and Clark expedition stopped near their villages for the winter because of it. In honor of their hosts, the expedition dubbed the settlement they constructed Fort Mandan. It was here that Lewis and Clark first met Sacagawea, a captive Shoshone woman. Sacagawea accompanied the expedition as it traveled west, assisting them with information and translating skills as they journeyed toward the Pacific Ocean. Upon their return to the Mandan villages, Lewis and Clark took the Mandan Chief &quot;Sheheke&quot; (Coyote or Big White) with them to Washington to meet with President Thomas Jefferson. He returned to the upper Missouri. He had survived the smallpox epidemic of 1781, but in 1812 Chief Sheheke was killed in a battle with Hidatsa.

In 1825 the Mandans signed a peace treaty with the leaders of the Atkinson-O&#x27;Fallon Expedition. The treaty required that the Mandans recognize the supremacy of the United States, admit that they reside on United States territory, and relinquish all control and regulation of trade to the United States. This was in exchange for annual payments that were never received. The Mandan and the United States Army never met in open warfare.

In 1832, artist George Catlin visited the Mandan near Fort Clark. Catlin painted and drew scenes of Mandan life as well as portraits of chiefs, including Four Bears or &quot;Ma-to-toh-pe&quot;. His skill at rendering so impressed Four Bears that he invited Catlin as the first man of European descent to be allowed to watch the sacred annual &quot;Okipa&quot; ceremony. During the winter months of 1833 and 1834, Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied and Swiss artist Karl Bodmer stayed with the Mandan.

====Speculation about pre-Columbian European contact====

18th-century reports about characteristics of Mandan lodges, religion and occasional physical features among tribal members, such as blue and grey eyes along with lighter hair coloring, stirred speculation about the possibility of pre-Columbian European contact. Catlin believed the Mandan were the &quot;Welsh Indians&quot; of folklore, descendants of Prince Madoc and his followers who had emigrated to America from Wales in about 1170. This view was popular at the time but has since been disputed by the bulk of scholarship.

Hjalmar Holand has proposed that interbreeding with Norse survivors might explain the &quot;blond&quot; Indians among the Mandan on the Upper Missouri River. In a multidisciplinary study of the Kensington Runestone, anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe dismissed, as &quot;tangential&quot; to the Runestone issue this and other historical references suggesting pre-Columbian contacts with &#x27;outsiders&#x27;, such as the Hochunk (Winnebago) story about an ancestral hero &quot;Red Horn&quot; and his encounter with &quot;red-haired giants&quot;. Archaeologist Ken Feder has stated that none of the material evidence that would be expected from a Viking presence in and travel through the American Midwest exists.

=== Intertribal warfare 1785-1845 ===

Sioux Indians attacked the Mandan village Nuptadi and set it on fire around 1785. The &quot;turtles&quot; used in the Okipa ceremony were saved. &quot;When Nuptadi Village was burned by the Sioux ...&quot;, recounted Mandan woman Scattercorn, &quot;... the turtles produced water which protected them ...&quot;.

The Sioux kept consolidating their dominant position on the northern plains. In the words of &quot;Cheyenne warrior&quot; and Lakota-allied George Bent: &quot;... the Sioux moved to the Missouri and began raiding these two tribes, until at last the Mandans and Rees [Arikaras] hardly dared go into the plains to hunt buffalo&quot;.

The Arikara Indians were from time to time also among the foes of the Mandans. Chief Four Bears&#x27;s revenge on the Arikara, who had killed his brother, is legendary.

The Mandan maintained the stockade around Mitutanka Village when threats were present.

Major fights were fought. &quot;We destroyed fifty tepees [of Sioux]. The following summer thirty men in a war party were killed&quot;, tells the Mandan winter count of Butterfly for 1835–1836. The big war party was neutralized by Yanktonai Sioux Indians.

Mitutanka, now occupied by Arikaras as well as some Mandans, was burned by Yankton Sioux Indians on January 9, 1839. &quot;... the small Pox last year, very near annihilated the Whole [Mandan] tribe, and the Sioux has finished the Work of destruction by burning the village&quot;.

In 1845, the Hidatsa moved some 20 miles north, crossed the Missouri and built Like-a-Fishhook Village. Many Mandans joined for common protection.

===Smallpox epidemic of 1837–38===

The Mandan were first plagued by smallpox in the 16th century and had been hit by similar epidemics every few decades. Between 1837 and 1838, another smallpox epidemic swept the region. In June 1837, an American Fur Company steamboat traveled westward up the Missouri River from St. Louis. Its passengers and traders aboard infected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes. There were approximately 1,600 Mandan living in the two villages at that time. The disease killed 90% of the Mandan people, effectively destroying their settlements. Almost all of the tribe&#x27;s members, including the second chief, Four Bears, died. Estimates of the number of survivors vary from 27 up to 150 persons, with some sources placing the number at 125. The survivors banded together with the nearby surviving Hidatsa in 1845 and moved upriver, where they developed Like-a-Fishhook Village.

The Mandan believed that they had been infected by whites associated with the steamboat and Fort Clark. Chief Four Bears reportedly said, while ailing, &quot;a set of Black harted Dogs, they have deceived Me, them that I always considered as Brothers, has turned Out to be My Worst enemies&quot;. Francis Chardon, in his &quot;Journal at Fort Clark 1834–1839&quot;, wrote that the Gros Ventres (ie. Hidatsa), &quot;swear vengeance against all the Whites, as they say the small pox was brought here by the S[team] B[oat].&quot; (Chardon, Journal, p. 126). In the earliest detailed study of the event, in &quot;The American Fur Trade of the Far West&quot; (1902), Hiram M. Chittenden blamed the American Fur Company for the epidemic. Oral traditions of the affected tribes continue to claim that whites were to blame for the disease. R. G. Robertson in his book &quot;Rotting Face: Smallpox and the American Indian&quot;, blames Captain Pratte of the steamboat &quot;St. Peter&quot; for failing to quarantine passengers and crew once the epidemic broke out, stating that while

not guilty of premeditated genocide, but he was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offence criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences.

Some scholars who have argued that the transmission of smallpox to Native Americans during the 1836-40 epidemic was intentional, including Ann F. Ramenofsky who asserted in 1987: &quot;&quot;Variola Major&quot; can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U.S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem.&quot; The Commissioner of Indian Affairs had refused to send the vaccine to the Mandans, apparently not thinking them worthy of protection.

Some accounts repeat a story that an Indian sneaked aboard the &quot;St. Peter&quot; and stole a blanket from an infected passenger, thus starting the epidemic. The many variations of this account have been criticized by both historians and contemporaries as fiction, a fabrication intended to assuage the guilt of white settlers for displacing the Indians. &quot;The blanket affair was created afterward and is not to be credited&quot;, notes B. A. Mann. Given trade and travel patterns, there were numerous ways for people to have been infected, as they had been in earlier, also severe, epidemics.

===Late-19th and 20th centuries===
The Mandan were a party in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. They shared a mutual treaty area north of Heart River with the Hidatsa and the Arikara.

Soon attacks on hunting parties by Lakota and other Sioux made it difficult for the Mandan to be safe in the treaty area. The tribes called for the United States Army to intervene, and they would routinely ask for such aid until the end of Lakota primacy. Despite the treaty, the Mandan received little protection from US forces.

In the summer of 1862, the Arikara joined the Mandan and Hidatsa in Like-a-Fishhook Village on the upper Missouri. All three tribes were forced to live &quot;outside&quot; their treaty area south of the Missouri by the frequent raiding of Lakota and other Sioux. Before the end of 1862, some Sioux Indians set fire to part of a Like-a-Fishhook Village.

In June 1874, there &quot;was a big war&quot; near Like-a-Fishhook-Village. Colonel George Armstrong Custer failed to cut off a large war party of Lakota that was attacking the Mandan, although &quot;... the Mandans should be protected same as white settlers&quot;. Five Arikaras and a Mandan were killed by the Lakota. The attack turned out to be one of the last made by the Lakota on the Three Tribes.
The Mandan joined with the Arikara in 1862. By this time, Like-a-Fishhook Village had become a major center of trade in the region. By the 1880s, though, the village was abandoned. In the second half of the 19th century, the Three Affiliated Tribes (the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) gradually lost control of some of their holdings. The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 recognized 12 million acres (49,000 km2) of land in the territory owned jointly by these tribes. With the creation of the Fort Berthold Reservation by Executive Order on April 12, 1870, the federal government acknowledged only that the Three Affiliated Tribes held 8 million acres (32,000 km2). On July 1, 1880, another executive order deprived the tribes of 7 million acres (28,000 km2) of land lying outside the boundaries of the reservation.

===20th century to present===
In the early 20th century, the government seized more land; by 1910, the reservation was reduced to 900,000 acres (3,600 km2). This land is located in Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail and Ward counties in North Dakota.

Under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, which encouraged tribes to restore their governments, the Mandan officially merged with the Hidatsa and the Arikara. They drafted a constitution to elect representative government and formed the federally recognized Three Affiliated Tribes, known as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

In 1951, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of Garrison Dam on the Missouri River. Developed for flood control and irrigation, this dam created Lake Sakakawea. It flooded portions of the Fort Berthold Reservation, including the villages of Fort Berthold and Elbowoods, as well as a number of other villages. The former residents of these villages were moved and New Town was constructed for them.

While New Town was constructed for the displaced tribal members, much damage was done to the social and economic foundations of the reservation by the loss of flooded areas. The flooding claimed approximately one quarter of the reservation&#x27;s land. This land contained some of the most fertile agricultural areas upon which their economy had been developed. The Mandan did not have other land that was as fertile or viable for agriculture. In addition, the flooding claimed the sites of historic villages and archaeological sites with sacred meaning for the peoples.

==Culture==

===Lodges and villages===


The Mandan were known for their distinctive, large, circular earthen lodges, in which more than one family lived. Their permanent villages were composed of these lodges. Constructed and maintained by women, each lodge was circular with a dome-like roof and a square hole at the apex of the dome through which smoke could escape. Four pillars supported the frame of the lodge. Wood timbers were placed against these, and the exterior was covered with a matting made from reeds and twigs and then covered with hay and earth, which protected the interior from rain, heat and cold. It was sturdy enough so that numerous adults and children could sit on the top of the lodge. The lodge also featured an extended portico-type structure at the entrance, to provide protection from cold and other weather.

The interior was constructed around four large pillars, upon which crossbeams supported the roof. These lodges were designed, built and owned by the women of the tribe, and ownership was passed through the female line. Generally in diameter, they could hold several families, up to 30 or 40 people, who were related through the elder women. When a young man married, he moved to his wife&#x27;s lodge, which she shared with her mother and sisters. Villages usually had around 120 lodges. Reconstructions of these lodges may be seen at Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park near Mandan, North Dakota, and the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site.

Originally lodges were rectangular, but around 1500 CE, lodges began to be constructed in a circular form. Toward the end of the 19th century, the Mandan began constructing small log cabins, usually with two rooms. When traveling or hunting, the Mandan would use skin tipis. Today, the Mandan live in modern dwellings.

Villages were usually oriented around a central plaza that was used for games (chunkey) and ceremonial purposes. In the center of the plaza was a cedar tree surrounded by a vertical wood enclosure. The shrine represented the &quot;Lone Man&quot;, one of the main figures in Mandan religion. He was said to have built a wooden corral that saved the people of a village from a flooding river in North Dakota. Villages were often situated on high bluffs above the river. Often, villages would be constructed at the meeting of tributaries, in order to use the water as a natural barrier. Where there were few or no natural barriers, the villages built some type of fortification, including ditches and wooden palisades.

===Family life===

The Mandan were originally divided into thirteen clans, which were reduced to seven by 1781, due to population losses in the smallpox epidemic. Ninety percent of the population died in the 1837-1838 smallpox epidemic. By 1950 only four clans survived.

Historically clans organized around successful hunters and their kin. Each clan was expected to care for its own, including orphans and the elderly, from birth to death. The dead were traditionally cared for by their father&#x27;s clan. Clans held a sacred or medicine bundle, which consisted of a few gathered objects believed to hold sacred powers. Those in possession of the bundles were considered to have sacred powers bestowed to them by the spirits and thus were considered the leaders of the clan and tribe. In historic times, the medicine bundles could be purchased, along with knowledge of the rites and rights associated with them, and then inherited by offspring.

Children were named ten days after their birth in a ceremony that officially linked the child with its family and clan. Girls were taught domestic skills, especially cultivation and processing of maize and other plants, preparation, tanning and processing of skins and meats, needlework and quillwork, and how to build and keep a home. Boys were taught hunting and fishing. The boys began fasting for religious visions at the age of ten or eleven. Marriage among the Mandan was generally arranged by members of one&#x27;s own clan, especially uncles; although, occasionally it would take place without the approval of the couple&#x27;s parents. Divorce could be easily obtained.

Upon the death of a family member, the father and his people would erect a scaffold near the village to contain the body. The body would be placed with the head toward the northwest and feet to the southeast. Southeast is the direction of the Ohio River Valley, from which the Mandan came. The Mandan would not sleep in this orientation, because it invited death. After a ceremony to send the spirit away, the family would mourn at the scaffold for four days. After the body rotted and the scaffold collapsed, the bones would be gathered up and buried, except for the skull, which was placed in a circle near the village. Family members would visit the skulls and talk to them, sometimes bearing their problems or regaling the dead with jokes. After the Mandan moved to the Fort Berthold Reservation, they resorted to placing the bodies in boxes or trunks, or wrapped them in fur robes and placed them in rocky crevices.

=== Mandan economy ===
Mandan food came from farming, hunting, gathering wild plants, and trade. Corn was the primary crop, and part of the surplus was traded with nomadic tribes for bison meat. Mandan gardens were often located near river banks, where annual flooding would leave the most fertile soil, sometimes in locations miles from villages. Women owned and tended the gardens, where they planted several varieties of corn, beans and squash. Sunflowers were planted first in early April. As early as the fifteenth century, the Mandan town Huff had enough storage pits to store seventy thousand bushels of corn.

Hunting the buffalo was a critical part of Mandan survival and rituals. They called the buffalo to &quot;come to the village&quot; in the &quot;Buffalo Dance&quot; ceremony at the beginning of each summer. In addition to eating the meat, the Mandan used all parts of the buffalo, so nothing went to waste. &#x27;Float bison&#x27;, which accidentally fell or were driven into the river, were considered a Mandan delicacy and the meat was eaten when half-rotten. The hides were used for buffalo-fur robes or were tanned, and the leather used for clothing, bags, shelter and other uses. The Mandan were known for their painted buffalo hides that often recorded historic events. The bones would be carved into items such as needles and fish hooks. Bones were also used in farming: for instance, the scapula was used as a hoe-like device for breaking the soil. The Mandan also trapped small mammals for food and hunted deer. Deer antlers were used to create rake-like implements used in farming. Birds were hunted for meat and feathers, the latter used for adornment. Archaeological evidence shows that the Mandan also ate fish.

The Mandan and neighboring Hidatsa villages were key centers of trade on the Northern plains. The Mandan sometimes traded far from home but more often nomadic plains peoples travelled to the upper Missouri villages to trade. For example William Clark in the winter of 1804 documented the arrival of thousands of Assiniboine Indians as well as Cree and Cheyenne to trade. The Mandan bartered corn in exchange for dried bison meat. The Mandan also exchanged horses with the Assiniboine in exchange for arms, ammunition and European products. Clark noted that the Mandan obtained horses and leather tents from peoples to the west and southwest such as Crows, Cheyennes, Kiowas and Arapahos.

===Dress===
Up until the late 19th century, when Mandan people began adopting Western-style dress, they commonly wore clothing made from the hides of buffalo, as well as of deer and sheep. From the hides, tunics, dresses, buffalo-fur robes, moccasins, gloves, loincloths and leggings could be made. These items were often ornamented with quills and bird feathers, and men sometimes wore the scalps of enemies.

Mandan women wore ankle-length dresses made of deerskin or sheepskin. This would often be girded at the waist with a wide belt. Sometimes the hem of the dress would be ornamented with pieces of buffalo hoof. Underneath the dress, they wore leather leggings with ankle-high moccasins. Women&#x27;s hair was worn straight down in braids.

During the winter months, men would commonly wear deerskin tunics and leggings with moccasins. They also kept themselves warm by wearing a robe of buffalo fur. During the summer months, however, they often wore only a loincloth of deerskin or sheepskin. Unlike the women, men would wear various ornaments in their hair. The hair was parted across the top with three sections hanging down in front. Sometimes the hair would hang down the nose and would be curled upwards with a curling stick. The hair would hang to the shoulders on the side, and the back portion would sometimes reach to the waist. The long hair in the back would create a tail-like feature, as it would be gathered into braids then smeared with clay and spruce gum, and tied with cords of deerskin. Headdresses of feathers were often worn as well. Besides buffalo, elk, and deer hides, the Mandan also used ermine and white weasel hides for clothing.

Today, Mandan people wear traditionally inspired clothing and regalia at powwows, ceremonies, and other significant events.

===Religion===

The Mandan&#x27;s religion and cosmology was highly complex and centered around the figure known as Lone Man. Lone Man was involved in many of the creation myths as well as one of the flood myths.

In their creation myth, the world was created by two rival deities, the First Creator and the Lone Man. The Missouri River divided the two worlds that the beings created. First Creator created the lands to the south of the river with hills, valleys, trees, buffalo, pronghorn antelope and snakes. To the north of the river, Lone Man created the Great Plains, domesticated animals, birds, fish and humans. The first humans lived underground near a large lake. Some of the more adventurous humans climbed a grapevine to the surface and discovered the two worlds. After returning underground, they shared their findings and decided to return with many others. As they were climbing the grapevine, it broke and half the Mandan were left underground.

According to Mandan beliefs, each person possessed four different, immortal souls. The first soul was white and often seen as a shooting star or meteor. The second soul was colored a light brown and was seen in the form of the meadowlark. The third soul, called the lodge spirit, remained at the site of the lodge after death and would remain there forever. The final soul was black and after death would travel away from the village. These final souls existed as did living people; residing in their own villages, and farming and hunting.

The &quot;Okipa&quot; ceremony was a major part of Mandan religious life. This complex ceremony related to the creation of the earth was first recorded by George Catlin. A man would volunteer to be the Okipa Maker, and sponsor the preparations and foods needed. Preparations took much of a year, as there were days of events, when crowds were hosted.

The ceremony opened with a Bison Dance, to call the buffalo to the people. It was followed by a variety of torturous ordeals through which warriors proved their physical courage and gained the approval of the spirits. The &quot;Okipa&quot; began with the young men not eating, drinking, or sleeping for four days. Then they were led to a hut, where they had to sit with smiling faces while the skin of their chest and shoulders was slit and wooden skewers were thrust behind the muscles. With the skewers tied to ropes and supporting the weight of their bodies, the warriors would be suspended from the roof of the lodge and would hang there until they fainted. To add agony, heavy weights or buffalo skulls were added to the initiates&#x27; legs. After fainting, the warriors would be pulled down and the men (women were not allowed to attend this ceremony) would watch them until they awoke, proving the spirits&#x27; approval. Upon awakening, the warriors would offer the left little finger to the Great Spirit, whereupon a masked tribesman would sever it with a hatchet blow. Finally, participants would endure a grueling race around the village called &quot;the last race&quot;, until the thongs tied to the buffalo skulls ripped out of their skin.

Those finishing the ceremony were seen as being honored by the spirits; those completing the ceremony twice would gain everlasting fame among the tribe. Chief Four Bears, or Ma-to-toh-pe, completed this ceremony twice. The last Okipa ceremony was performed in 1889, but the ceremony was resurrected in a somewhat different form in 1983. The version of the &quot;Okipa&quot; as practiced by the Lakota may be seen in the 1970 film &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; starring Richard Harris.

===Present day===
The Mandan and the two culturally related tribes, the Hidatsa (Siouan) and Arikara (Caddoan), while being combined have intermarried but do maintain, as a whole, the varied traditions of their ancestors. The tribal residents have recovered from the trauma of their displacement in the 1950s.

They constructed the Four Bears Casino and Lodge in 1993, attracting tourists and generating gaming and employment income for the impoverished reservation.

The most recent addition to the New Town area has been the new Four Bears Bridge, which was built in a joint effort between the three tribes and the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The bridge, spanning the Missouri River, replaces an older Four Bears Bridge that was built in 1955. The new bridge—the largest bridge in the state of North Dakota—is decorated with medallions celebrating the cultures of the three tribes. The bridge was opened to traffic September 2, 2005, and was officially opened in a ceremony on October 3.

<text>Miha Mazzini (born 3 June 1961 in Jesenice, Yugoslavia) is a Slovenian writer, screenwriter and film director with thirty published books, translated in ten languages. He has a PhD in anthropology from the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis and has MA in Creative Writing for Film and Television at the University of Sheffield. He is a voting member of the European Film Academy.

==Biography and works==
Mazzini described his childhood in Titoist Yugoslavia, in three novels. The protagonist of the 2002 novel, &quot;King of the Rattling Spirits,&quot; (based on his 2001 &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; film script) is 12 years old. In the 2015 novel, &quot;Childhood,&quot; the protagonist is five. In the third novel &quot;It&#x27;s Personal,&quot; (2022) the protagonist sums up his childhood and its consequences.

His first novel &quot;Crumbs&quot; (American title &quot;The Cartier Project&quot;) was set in his hometown of Jesenice and published in 1989 and sold 54,000 copies.

He was the first Slovenian writer to write a novel about the erased, people who lost all of their rights and legal status after the declaration of the country&#x27;s independence in 1991. Later he adapted the novel for the feature film &quot;Erased&quot;.

His historical novel Paloma Negra deals with Yu-Mex music in the 1950s, when Yugoslav singers started mimicking the songs and music they saw in Mexican films. During the research for the novel, Mazzini recorded the stories told by protagonists and made a documentary called &quot;Yugoslav Mexico&quot; (YuMex). The novel &quot;German Lottery&quot; is set in the same era but deals with swindlers, illusions and unreliable protagonists.

Mazzini introduced in the post-1990 Slovene literature a tough protagonist, characteristic of Noir fiction, in his novel &quot;Guarding Hanna.&quot;

His work was selected for international anthologies; including his short story &quot;Mother&quot; included in &quot;Contemporary European Fiction,&quot; and &quot;Avro Lancaster&quot; in &quot;Best European Fiction 2018&quot;.

== Awards ==
&quot;The&quot; &quot;Cartier Project&quot; won the 1987 Best Novel of the Year award from both pro-government and opposition newspapers.

In 2012, one of his stories (&quot;That Winter&quot;) received the Pushcart Prize.

Mazzini won the 2016 Kresnik Award for his novel &quot;Otroštvo&quot; (&quot;Childhood&quot;).

in 2019 he won best screenplay for the film &quot;Erased&quot; at FEST festival, Belgrade, Serbia, and at the Raindance festival, London, UK.

== Reviews ==
:&quot;In ... &quot;Guarding Hanna&quot;, [Mazzini] has created a bestial protagonist ... a gargoyle of a man [who] struggles heroically with his own nature only to find that life has played him one horrific joke.&quot;
:— &quot;The Village Voice&quot;

:&quot;[Hanna&#x27;s] a wonderful creation: vulnerable, lonely, trying to keep her mood upbeat but not always succeeding. In fact, she’s just the thing to melt the Beast’s hostility—or drive him, with her chatter, to homicidal distraction...Throw in the narrator’s grim musings on his lot in life and his occasional urge to strangle Hanna, and you have a tonic mix of menace and comedy that keeps things hopping right up to the book’s twist ending.&quot;
:— &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;
==Commentary==
In October 2019, Mazzini commented on the decision of the Swedish Academy to give the Nobel Prize for literature to Peter Handke by saying, &quot;some artists sold their human souls for ideologies (Hamsun and Nazism), some for hate (Celine and his rabid antisemitism), some for money and power (Kusturica) but the one that offended me the most was Handke with his naivety for the Milošević regime (...) I found him cruel and totally self-absorbed in his naivety.&quot;

<text>.af is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Afghanistan. It is administered by AFGNIC, a service of the UNDP. 

== History ==
The .af domain was delegated to Abdul Razeeq in 1997, a year after Taliban fighters had captured Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. 

NetNames of London initially maintained the domain following an agreement with the IANA. Razeeq later disappeared, halting some services. 

The domain was reopened on March 10, 2003, as a joint program between UNDP and the Afghan Ministry of Communications.

As of 26 August 2020, .af was used by 5960 domains.

With the fall of Kabul in 2021, the .af domain again came under the control of the Taliban. ICANN said it &quot;defers decision making to within the country&quot;.

== Registration ==
Registration is made directly at the second level, or on the third level beneath various categorized subdomains at the second level. 

Third-level domains have restrictions based on which second-level domain they are registered under. Registration on the second level is unrestricted, but more expensive. All fees are higher for international registrants.

=== Restrictions ===
In 2024, a number of .af domains including &quot;broke.af&quot; and &quot;queer.af&quot; went offline. 

The Afghan Ministry of Communications and IT said that they were registered through Gandi, a France-based domain name registrar, and cited Gandi&#x27;s failure to make payments as the reason for suspension.

==Second-level domains==

<text>.ag is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Antigua and Barbuda. As of 2021 the .ag CcTLD is maintained by the UHSA School of Medicine.

== Second and third level registrations ==

Registrations can be made at the second level directly beneath .ag, or at the third level beneath:

There are no restrictions on who can register.

==Domain hacks==
In addition to its original intended use as a country code, the .ag domain has been marketed for use for agriculture-related sites, and for sites referencing the atomic symbol for silver, &quot;Ag&quot;. 

It also has a potential use for other domain hacks for English words that end in -ag. The Heritage Foundation uses .ag for URL shortening (herit.ag), as well as The Association of Former Students of Texas A&amp;M University (tx.ag). 

=== &quot;.ag&quot; meaning &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; ===

, abbreviated AG, is a German term that refers to a corporation that is limited by shares, i.e. owned by shareholders, and may be traded on a stock market. 

The term is used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but not Liechtenstein or Luxembourg.

====Legal status of .ag in Germany====
A German court (&quot;5. Zivilsenat des Oberlandesgerichtes Hamburg&quot;) ruled in July 2004 that a &quot;.ag&quot; domain may only be registered by an , and then only by an AG that has the same name as the domain. 

For example, a company with shareholders in Germany having the name X AG may not register as y.ag.

===Use in Greenland===
The newspaper Sermitsiaq uses the TLD since its merger with the paper Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten, which was marketed as AG as an abbreviation of its combined Greenlandic and Danish names, thus implying a continuation of its identity.

<doc id="999229" wikidata="Q32811" url="?curid=999229" title="Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis">
<text>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as allergic granulomatosis, is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons with a history of airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).

It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening.

This condition is now called &quot;eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis&quot; to remove all eponyms from the vasculitides. To facilitate the transition, it was referred to as &quot;eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss)&quot; for a period of time starting in 2012. Prior to this it was known as Churg–Strauss syndrome, named after Jacob Churg and Lotte Strauss, who first published about the syndrome in 1951 using the term &quot;allergic granulomatosis&quot; to describe it. It is a type of systemic necrotizing vasculitis.

Effective treatment of EGPA requires suppression of the immune system with medication. This is typically glucocorticoids, followed by other agents such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis consists of three stages, but not all patients develop all three stages or progress from one stage to the next in the same order; whereas some patients may develop severe or life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal involvement and heart disease, some patients are only mildly affected, e.g. with skin lesions and nasal polyps. EGPA is consequently considered a highly variable condition in terms of its presentation and its course.

=== Allergic stage ===
The prodromal stage is characterized by allergy. Almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, with more than 90% having a history of asthma that is either a new development, or the worsening of pre-existing asthma, which may require systemic corticosteroid treatment. On average, asthma develops from three to nine years before the other signs and symptoms.

The allergic rhinitis may produce symptoms such as rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, and the formation of nasal polyps that require surgical removal, often more than once. Sinusitis may also be present.

=== Eosinophilic stage ===
The second stage is characterized by an abnormally high level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and tissues as a result of abnormal eosinophil proliferation, impaired eosinophil apoptosis, and increased toxicity due to eosinophil metabolic products. A normal 5% eosinophil composition in total leukocyte count can be elevated to 60% in EGPA, and this local accumulation of eosinophil is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma described in the allergic stage by initiating and maintaining immune responses in inflammation. The symptoms of hypereosinophilia depend on which part of the body is affected, but most often it affects the lungs and digestive tract. The signs and symptoms of hypereosinophilia may include weight loss, night sweats, asthma, cough, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Fever and malaise are often present. The eosinophilic stage can last months or years, and its symptoms can disappear, only to return later.

=== Vasculitic stage ===
The third and final stage, and hallmark of EGPA, is inflammation of the blood vessels, and the consequent reduction of blood flow to various organs and tissues. The damage done to the blood vessels can be explained by the overabundance of eosinophils that are produced and flowing throughout the vasculature of the body; eosinophil production, while essential for assisting inflammatory responses to infections and diseases, can lead to tissue damage when it is done in excess. Local and systemic symptoms become more widespread and are compounded by new symptoms from the vasculitis.

Severe complications may arise. Blood clots may develop within the damaged arteries in severe cases, particularly in arteries of the abdominal region, which is followed by infarction and cell death, or slow atrophy. Many patients experience severe abdominal complaints; these are most often due to peritonitis and/or ulcerations and perforations of the gastrointestinal tract, but occasionally due to acalculous cholecystitis or granulomatous appendicitis.

The most serious complication of the vasculitic stage is heart disease, which is the cause of nearly one-half of all deaths in patients with EGPA. Among heart disease-related deaths, the most usual cause is inflammation of the heart muscle caused by the high level of eosinophils, although some are deaths due to inflammation of the arteries that supply blood to the heart or pericardial tamponade. Kidney complications have been reported as being less common. Complications in the kidneys can include glomerulonephritis, which prevents the kidneys&#x27; ability to filter the blood, ultimately causing wastes to build up in the bloodstream.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnostic markers include eosinophil granulocytes and granulomas in affected tissue, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against neutrophil granulocytes. Two pathological subsets of EGPA are differentiated by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack specific proteins found within the cytoplasm of neutrophils. The ANCA+ subtype is characterized by predominantly vasculitis-like manifestations, while the ANCA- subtype is more commonly associated with eosinophilic-related symptoms. Approximately 30-40% of EGPA cases are ANCA+. While the pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood, this finding suggests a role of B cells – the precursors of ANCA-producing plasma cells – in the pathogenesis of EGPA.

The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for diagnosis of Churg–Strauss syndrome lists these criteria:
* Asthma
* Eosinophilia, i.e. eosinophil blood count greater than 500/microliter, or hypereosinophilia, i.e. eosinophil blood count greater than 1,500/microliter
* Presence of mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy
* Unfixed pulmonary infiltrates
* Presence of paranasal sinus abnormalities
* Histological evidence of extravascular eosinophils

For classification purposes, a patient shall be said to have EGPA if at least four of these six criteria are positive. The presence of any four or more of the six criteria yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%.

===Risk stratification===
The French Vasculitis Study Group has developed a five-point system (&quot;five-factor score&quot;) that predicts the risk of death in Churg–Strauss syndrome using clinical presentations. These factors are:
* Reduced renal function (creatinine &gt;1.58 mg/dl or 140 μmol/L)
* Proteinuria (&gt;1 g/24h)
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infarction, or pancreatitis
* Involvement of the central nervous system
* Cardiomyopathy

Having none of these factors indicates milder case, with a five-year mortality rate of 11.9%. The presence of one factor indicates severe disease, with a five-year mortality rate of 26%, and three or more indicate very severe disease: 46% five-year mortality rate.

===Imaging===
On CT scan of the lungs, peripheral parenchymal opacification (pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacity) in the middle and lower zones is the predominant pattern. Interlobular septal thickening (septa separating the secondary pulmonary lobules can be due to pulmonary odema secondary to heart failure.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis includes glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide). In many cases, the disease can be put into a type of chemical remission through drug therapy, but the disease is chronic and lifelong.

A systematic review conducted in 2007 indicated all patients should be treated with high-dose steroids, but in patients with a five-factor score of one or higher, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy should be commenced, with 12 pulses leading to fewer relapses than six. Remission can be maintained with a less toxic drug, such as azathioprine or methotrexate.

On 12 December 2017, the FDA approved mepolizumab, the first drug therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients taking mepolizumab experienced a &quot;significant improvement&quot; in their symptoms. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5, a major factor in eosinophil survival.

In addition to mepolizumab, a number of emerging targeted biotherapies—including the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, immunomodulation with Interferon-α, and B cell therapy with rituximab—may lead to increasingly personalized treatment regimens for future EGPA patients. A review of EGPA treatments conducted in 2020 proposes integrating targeted biotherapies into EGPA management plans following failure of treatment with corticosteroids.

On 18 September 2024, AstraZeneca announced FDA approval for Fasenra (benralizumab), a biologic drug therapy indicated for use in adult patients with EGPA, following the MANDARA Phase III trial results. Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the first head-to-head non-inferiority trial of biologics in patients with relapsing or refractory EGPA measured the efficacy and safety of Fasenra against mepolizumab. Patients were randomized to receive either one 30mg subcutaneous injection of Fasenra, or three 100mg subcutaneous injections of mepolizumab every four weeks. Resultantly, nearly 60% of Fasenra-treated patients achieved remission, with 41% of Fasenra-treated patients fully tapered from oral corticosteroids compared to 26% in mepolizumab-treated patients.

== History ==
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described by pathologists Jacob Churg (1910–2005) and Lotte Strauss (1913–1985) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1951, using the term &quot;allergic granulomatosis&quot; to describe it. They reported &quot;fever...hypereosinophilia, symptoms of cardiac failure, renal damage, and peripheral neuropathy, resulting from vascular embarrassment in various systems of organs&quot; in a series of 13 patients with necrotizing vasculitis previously diagnosed as &quot;periarteritis nodosa&quot;, accompanied by hypereosinophilia and severe asthma. Churg and Strauss noted three features which distinguished their patients from other patients with periarteritis nodosa but without asthma: necrotizing vasculitis, tissue eosinophilia, and extravascular granuloma. As a result, they proposed that these cases were evident of a different disease entity, which they referred to as &quot;allergic granulomatosis and angiitis&quot;.

== Society and culture ==
The memoir &quot;Patient&quot;, by musician Ben Watt (of Everything but the Girl fame), deals with his experience with EGPA in 1992, and his recovery. Watt&#x27;s case was unusual in that it mainly affected his gastrointestinal tract, leaving his lungs largely unaffected; this unusual presentation contributed to a delay in proper diagnosis. His treatment required the removal of 5 m (15 ft) of necrotized small intestine (about 75%), leaving him on a permanently restricted diet.

Umaru Musa Yar&#x27;Adua, the president of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010, reportedly had EGPA and died in office of complications of the disease.

DJ and author Charlie Gillett was diagnosed with EGPA in 2006; he died four years later.

Japanese ski jumper Taku Takeuchi, who won the bronze medal in the team competition in 2014, has the disease and competed at the Sochi Olympics less than a month after being released from hospital treatment.

New Zealand reporter and television presenter Toni Street was diagnosed with the condition in 2015. Street has had health problems for several years, including removal of her gallbladder four months prior.

American professional basketball player Willie Naulls died on 22 November 2018 in Laguna Niguel, California, from respiratory failure due to EGPA, which he had been battling for eight years.

Canadian stand-up comic Candy Palmater died on December 25, 2021, shortly after being diagnosed with EGPA.

Filipino actress Kris Aquino, sister of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, revealed on 16 May 2022 that she was diagnosed with EGPA.

<text>.ai is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. It is administered by the government of Anguilla.

It is a popular domain hack with companies and projects related to the artificial intelligence industry (AI).

Google&#x27;s ad targeting treats .ai as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted.&quot;

Identity Digital began managing the domain as of January 2025.

== Second and third level registrations ==
Registrations within off.ai, com.ai, net.ai, and org.ai are available worldwide without restriction. From 15 September 2009, second level registrations within .ai are available to everyone worldwide.

==Registration==
The minimum registration term allowed for a .ai domain is 2 years for registration and 2 years for renewal. The authority in charge of managing this extension is “WHOIS.AI”. Registrations began on 1995-02-16. The minimum length is 2 and the maximum is 63 characters. There are no requirements for registering a domain, including local and foreign residents. 

A .ai domain can be suspended or revoked, if the domain is involved in illegal activity such as violating trademarks or copyrights. Usage must not violate the laws of Anguilla.

Anguilla uses the UDRP. Filing a UDRP challenge requires using one of the ICANN Approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. If the domain is with an ICANN accredited registrar, they should work with the arbitrator. Usually this means either doing nothing or transferring a domain. .ai domains are transferable to any desired registrars as the registration of domain is done maintaining EPP.

The character set supported for .ai domain names include A–Z, a–z, 0–9, and hyphen. As of November 2022, .ai domains cannot accommodate IDN characters. The auction of expired .ai domains is undertaken every ten days where expired domains can be procured through the auction process.

== Valuation ==
Domains are $180 for each two-year period. As of December 2017, the &quot;.ai&quot; registry supports Extensible Provisioning Protocol. Consequently, many registrars are allowed to sell &quot;.ai&quot; domains. Since then, the .ai ccTLD has also been popular with artificial intelligence companies and organizations. Though such trends are primarily seen among new AI based companies or startups, many established AI and Tech companies preferred not to opt for .ai domains. For example, DeepMind has its domain retained at .com; Meta has redirected its facebook.ai domain to ai.meta.com.

As of November 2022, &quot;expert.ai&quot; is the most valued .ai domain that has been sold. The sell was brokered and mediated by Sedo in June 2020 and was finalized at €95,000 (about US$108,000).
== Impact on Anguilla&#x27;s economy ==
The registration fees earned from the .ai domains go to the treasury of Government of Anguilla. As per a &quot;New York Times&quot; report, in 2018, the total revenue generated out of selling .ai domains was $2.9 million.

In 2023, Anguilla’s government made about US$32 million from fees collected for registering .ai domains. That amounted to more than 10% of gross domestic product for the territory.

<text>.al is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Albania. It is administered by the Electronic and Postal Communications Authority of Albania (AKEP).

AKEP recommends that .al domain registrations be performed with one of the AKEP accredited registrars. There are also international registrars that resell .al domains. Domain names should be between 2 and 63 characters. Although the Albanian language has a number of special characters, the registry has not enabled the use of IDN characters.

==2nd level registrations==

In the past, registrations were not permitted directly at the second level, but a few existing names were &quot;grandfathered&quot;; they were uniti.al, tirana.al, soros.al, upt.al and inima.al.

In 2012 registrars started to resell .al domain names widely making them popular outside Albania as domain hacks.
In November 2014 the registry released two character domain names allowing for free landrush.

==3rd level registrations==

Registrations used to be only beneath the second-levels, i.e., .com.al, .net.al, .org.al, and .edu.al labeled appropriately for the type of organisation, but many now exist directly below .al.

==Whois servers==
As of November 1, 2019, the Autoriteti i Komunikimeve Elektronike dhe Postare (AKEP) has mandated that all AKEP accredited registrars begin verifying and updating the WHOIS contact information for all new domain registrations and Registrant contact modifications.

==Domain figures==

As of the end of 2022 there were 27,275 registered .al-domains.

<text>Auzout is a lunar impact crater that is located to the southeast of the Mare Crisium, near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is named after French astronomer Adrien Auzout. Attached to the southern rim is the smaller crater van Albada. To the east-northeast is the large Condorcet. This crater is not especially notable, although it does possess a central mountain. This crater is designated &#x27;Azout&#x27; in some sources.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Auzout. 


The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Auzout A — &quot;See&quot; van Albada (crater).
* Auzout B — &quot;See&quot; Krogh (crater).

<text>SNCASO (abbreviated from Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Sud-Ouest ), or commonly Sud-Ouest, was a French aircraft manufacturer.

Created during 1936 as one of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies, SNCASO became a key French aircraft manufacturer following the end of the Second World War. It produced numerous innovation aircraft; amongst the company&#x27;s more notable projects was the first French jet aircraft, the Sud-Ouest Triton, and the first indigenously-developed French helicopter, the Sud-Ouest Djinn.

On 1 March 1957, SNCASO merged with another French nationalised aviation company, SNCASE, (&quot;Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Sud-Est&quot;), to form Sud Aviation.

==History==
Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry, the government of Léon Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry. The act provided for the creation of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich). In accordance with this agreement, SNCASO was formed on 16 November 1936 from the merger of the factories of Blériot of Suresnes, Bloch of Villacoublay and Courbevoie, SASO (&quot;Société Aéronautique du Sud-Ouest&quot;) of Bordeaux-Mérignac, UCA (&quot;Usine de Construction Aéronautique&quot;) of Bordeaux-Bègles, Société Aérienne Bordelaise (SAB) of Bordeaux-Bacalan and Lioré et Olivier of Rochefort. Additionally, SNCASO constructed a new factory in Déols during that same year.

The company&#x27;s fortunes, along with that of the wider French nation, were heavily affected by the events of the Second World War, particularly the formation of the occupation of France by German forces. Despite the country&#x27;s hardship during the conflict, SNCASO continued to operate. During 1941, the Paris design bureaus of both the nationalized and the private aircraft firms were relocated; according to aviation historian Gérard Hartmann, this measure was taken to avoid capture. That same year, SNCASO took over the assets of the ailing SNCAO. The company worked on various projects throughout the war, often under a heavy level of secrecy, including into the new field of jet propulsion. France, akin to the other Allied nations in the war, had benefitted from captured Germany high speed research; these factors combined gave a great impetus to undertaking advanced research projects.
Amongst the first new aviation projects to be launched in France during the postwar era was SNCASO&#x27;s jet-powered Sud-Ouest Triton. According to aviation author John W.R. Taylor, the origins of the Triton can be traced back to a clandestine research effort conducted during 1943, headed by the French aeronautics engineer Lucien Servanty. Shortly after the end of the conflict, the new French government issued a requirement, calling for a total of five prototype aircraft to be constructed for testing purposes. The development of indigenously designed jet aircraft was seen as of national importance to the government, being intended to symbolise and embody the speedy recovery of France&#x27;s industrial and military strength.

To speed up development of the Triton, which would become the first French jet-powered aircraft to fly, it was decided to use the German-designed Junkers Jumo 004-B2 engine after severe development issues were encountered with the indigenously developed Rateau-Anxionnaz GTS-65 turbojet engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was also adopted for multiple of the prototypes. On 11 November 1946, the first prototype Triton performed its maiden flight. However, further development of the Triton was ultimately abandoned during the early 1950s; it was never use in any operational circumstance. The design had been rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of advancements, both in terms of jet propulsion specifically and wider aerospace capabilities generally, with numerous jet-powered designs being produced around this timeframe.

SNCASO also branched out into helicopters. It gained useful experiences from the experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel, a tip jet helicopter, that enabled the firm&#x27;s design team to pursue development of a practical light helicopter that would harness this technology. They designed a compact and lightweight twin-seat rotorcraft, which was promptly designated as the Sud-Ouest Djinn. While this newer design did not share an identical tip jet system to the Ariel, the type did rely upon the same basic concept of feeding compressed air, which was generated by an onboard pump, to the tips of the vehicle&#x27;s rotor blades to drive the movement of the blades. First flying in January 1953, the Djinn proved itself to be a viable design; after several further prototypes were completed and tested, the type went into mass production. The Djinn was the first indigenously developed French helicopter, as well as being one of the first practical European helicopters to be produced. It was also the first tip-jet propelled rotorcraft to enter production.

Almost immediately after the war, the resurgent French Air Force also produced a requirement for a jet bomber with a takeoff weight of roughly 25–30 tonnes and capable of flying at high- speeds; its development was viewed as a major technological challenge as it called for the production of France&#x27;s first jet bomber. SNCASO was amongst several French aircraft manufacturers to tender, submitting its SO.4000; it received a development order for a pair of manned scale models and a full-sized prototype. During 1947, as a result of the rapid advances made in aviation technologies made around this time, plans for the SO.4000&#x27;s production run were abandoned; nevertheless, it was decided to complete the two scale models and the full size prototype for experimental purposes. Both scale models provided valuable data on features such as swept wings, pilot escape systems, spoiler control, and leading edge slats. On 5 March 1950, the SO.4000 was rolled out; by this point, it was already obsolete and lacking in capabilities compared to its contemporaries. Following an accident that damaged the airframe, work on the project was abandoned. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the SO.4000 was a very heavy aircraft, which only compounded the weakness of possessing relatively little engine power, giving it an extremely poor thrust-to-weight ratio even when empty; they also criticised it as possessing &quot;useless capabilities&quot;.
During June 1951, the French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (AdA) issued a separate requirement for a jet-powered aircraft capable of functioning as a bomber, a low-level attack aircraft, or an all-weather interceptor. In response, SNCASO adapted its existing &quot;S.O. 4000&quot; design to perform the desired roles. During 1951, prototype testing had demonstrated promising performance for the type, which encouraged its further development. Named the Vautour, the IIB bomber variant was used to carry France&#x27;s nuclear weapons in addition to a conventional arsenal; as such, for some years the Vautour was an important element of the nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, &quot;It would be fair to claim that in the early 1950s the Vautour was the most promising twin-jet warplane in Western Europe&quot;.

SNCASO developed several variants of the Vautour for different purposes, including the interceptor role; several were proposed but ultimately unbuilt. During 1956, two years prior to the Vautour even entering squadron service, France issued a more demanding requirement for a supersonic replacement aircraft. The Vautour was viewed as a stop-gap measure for the nuclear deterrent role, as its performance in this role was typically thought to be limited at best, while this more capable follow-on aircraft was under development. While the newer bomber requirement would ultimately result in the selection, development and manufacture of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber; SNCASO chose to respond to the requirement, producing their own proposal of an envisioned &quot;Super Vautour&quot;. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the unbuilt &#x27;stretched&#x27; Super Vautour would have featured an increased combat radius of 1,700 miles as well as the ability to attain at least Mach 0.9.

During the rationalisation of the nationalised Aircraft Industry during the 1950s, SNCASO was merged with SNCASE to form Sud Aviation on 1 March 1957. Over the subsequent decades, Sud Aviation was in turn was amalgamated into French defense conglomerate Aérospatiale and eventually became a part of the multinational EADS group, today trading as the Airbus Group.

<doc id="999265" wikidata="Q3205256" url="?curid=999265" title="The Rover (play)">
<text>The Rover or The Banish&#x27;d Cavaliers is a play in two parts that is written by the English author Aphra Behn. It is a revision of Thomas Killigrew&#x27;s play &quot;Thomaso, or The Wanderer&quot; (1664), and features multiple plot lines, dealing with the amorous adventures of a group of Englishmen and women in Naples at Carnival time. According to Restoration poet John Dryden, it &quot;lacks the manly vitality of Killigrew&#x27;s play, but shows greater refinement of expression.&quot; The play stood for three centuries as &quot;Behn&#x27;s most popular and most respected play.&quot;

==Characters==
===Women===

==Plot==
=== Act I ===
Sisters Hellena and Florinda&#x27;s fates have been decided for them by the men in their life, mainly their brother and father. Hellena is to enter the convent after Carnival has ended. Florinda&#x27;s father wants her to marry elderly Don Vincentio and her brother, Don Pedro, wants her to marry Don Antonio. However, she has feelings for Belville, an English colonel. The women, not approving of these plans, dress up for Carnival in an attempt to avoid their chosen fates.

Belville, Blunt, Frederick, and Willmore are also enjoying Carnival when they run into Florinda, Hellena, and Valeria (their cousin). Willmore and Hellena flirt with one another; Hellena agrees to meet Willmore again later. Meanwhile, Lucetta begins to seduce Blunt. Florinda begins to set up a meeting with Belville when she sees her brother approaching. She hastily gives him a letter and runs off with Hellena and Valeria. Florinda&#x27;s letter contains instructions for Belville to come to her garden at ten that night and carry her off. Blunt sneaks off with Lucetta.

=== Act II ===
Willmore, Belville, and Frederick go to see Angellica, a famous courtesan. Angellica&#x27;s servants hang up a portrait of her outside of her house. The Englishmen are astounded by her beauty, but leave when they realise they do not have the money to buy her—one thousand crowns a month. Don Pedro enters and sees the picture and the price. He has the money and runs to fetch it.

Angellica laments that no one has taken her up because of the high price, but when she learns of Don Pedro and Don Antonio, both of whom are rich, she decides to pursue them, then goes back inside. Pedro soon enters from one side of the stage, and Antonio enters from the other; both men are masked. Antonio is also struck by Angellica&#x27;s portrait and wonders out loud if he could get away with sleeping with Angellica and still marry Florinda. At the mention of Florinda, Pedro recognizes Antonio. They fight. Willmore and Blunt enter and break them up. Pedro challenges Antonio to a duel the next day over Angellica. Antonio accepts.

Meanwhile, Willmore sees a smaller picture of Angellica and tries to steal it. Antonio tells him to put it back. Willmore refuses and says that Antonio has the money to pay for the real thing. Angellica enters just in time to see another fight break out. Angellica asks Willmore to speak with her inside as she was initially very excited and impressed by him. Willmore goes, despite Belville and Frederick&#x27;s fears that Angellica is angry with him. Willmore tries to persuade Angellica to sleep with him for free. Normally Angellica would not agree to this, but she has fallen in love with Willmore, with his wits and his way. She agrees, despite the warnings from her maidservant Moretta.

=== Act III ===
Hellena says that she is not in love, but she cannot stop thinking about Willmore. The women see Belville, Blunt, and Frederick approach, and eavesdrop on the men. Belville, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica because he has been inside with her for two hours. Willmore comes out and brags about having enjoyed Angellica&#x27;s charms for free.

Hellena, who has seen and heard everything Willmore said, comes out of hiding and pretends as if nothing has transpired. As Willmore begins to flirt with her again, Angellica enters, masked, and sees Willmore betraying the vows he made to her. Hellena finally reveals her face to Willmore, who praises her beauty. This is the last straw for Angellica. She orders one of her servants to find out who Hellena is and storms out. Hellena asks what Willmore was doing in Angellica&#x27;s house; he denies that anything transpired. Hellena then attacks him, quoting to him what he had just said about Angellica. She makes Willmore promise never to see Angellica again. Meanwhile, Florinda and Valeria are testing Belville&#x27;s loyalty to Florinda by trying to seduce him while he doesn&#x27;t know who they are. He stands firm. The women exit, but Florinda leaves Belville with a locket. Belville recognizes Florinda&#x27;s picture in the locket and resolves to rescue her that night, with Willmore and Frederick&#x27;s help. Meanwhile, Blunt is tricked out of his money and clothes by Lucetta.

Florinda waits in her garden for Belville wearing a nightgown. Willmore enters, drunk, mistakes Florinda for a prostitute, and tries to persuade her to sleep with him. When she resists he attempts to rape her, but when Belville and Frederick enter, Florinda runs off. Willmore and Belville almost fight, but Frederick intervenes. The noise however, brings Pedro and his servants to the garden. A fight breaks out and the English are driven off.

Willmore tries to explain to a furious Belville that he didn&#x27;t know who Florinda was and mistook her for a whore. Belville and Frederick leave to find Florinda.

Antonio enters, hoping that his page has paid Angellica so he can sleep with her. Willmore sees this and starts a fight with Antonio. Antonio falls, wounded. Willmore believes he has killed Antonio and runs off. Belville runs in, fearing that it is Willmore who has been hurt. Soldiers enter and arrest Belville, believing him to be the attacker. Antonio finds his strength and orders Belville taken to his house.

===Act IV===
Don Antonio does not believe that Belville is innocent of having injured him; however, he offers Belville an alternative to imprisonment. Since Antonio is wounded and cannot duel Pedro, Belville could dress up as Antonio and go instead. Belville agrees, believing the fight to be over Florinda.

Florinda frets that Belville did not come to her window as planned, and fears that the impending duel is between Belville and Pedro. Pedro enters, masked, and reveals that he will be fighting Antonio, relieving some of Florinda&#x27;s fears. Belville enters, disguised as Antonio. Florinda runs in to stop them. Belville is confused as to why Florinda would defend his rival but they push her away and fight. Florinda stops them again just as Belville disarms Pedro. She begs him spare Pedro. Belville lays his sword at Florinda&#x27;s feet and swears his love to her. The action redeems him in Pedro&#x27;s eyes, so he gives his sister to the man he believes to be Antonio, demanding that they get married at once. Florinda protests, but Belville secretly lifts his mask to show her who he is.

Just then, Willmore and Frederick enter. Wilmore greets him by embrace. The embrace makes Belville drop his mask. Pedro now refuses to allow the wedding, since it was Antonio&#x27;s fight, not Belville&#x27;s. He drags Florinda away, accusing her of trying to trick him. Belville, furious at being thwarted yet again, turns on Willmore and chases him away. Angellica enters with her servants Moretta and Sebastian, furious that Willmore loves Hellena. Sebastian runs after Willmore to bring him back. Angellica accuses Willmore of having another woman. Willmore, as usual, attempts to charm her back.

Hellena enters disguised as a man. She decides to interfere and approaches Angellica pretending to be one of Hellena&#x27;s servants. She tells a story about a young girl who fell in love and was left standing at the altar because her lover came to Angellica. Then she reveals the lover to be Willmore. Angellica is moved by the story, Willmore is only excited and impatient to find out who the woman in question is. Suddenly, Willmore recognizes Hellena and figures out what&#x27;s going on. He turns to Angellica and starts describing Hellena as a Gypsy, ugly, a monkey, etc. He tells Hellena to go back to her mistress. Angellica is outraged with Willmore and vows to take revenge and sends Willmore away. Willmore exits with an aside in which he says he plans to try to win Hellena back.

Florinda and Valeria enter, disguised in different costumes, having momentarily escaped Pedro. Then Don Pedro, Belville, and Willmore enter. Pedro and Belville seem to be having a serious conversation. Willmore follows Florinda when she walks past, again thinking she is a courtesan. Frederick comes in and relates Blunt&#x27;s misadventures to Belville and Pedro. They all go off to find him. Florinda reenters, still being chased by Willmore. Then Hellena arrives and sees Willmore pursuing this &quot;unknown&quot; woman. She sends a page to find out where they go. Florinda ducks into a door to avoid Willmore; it turns out to be Belville&#x27;s house. The page Hellena sent goes off to relay the information.

Blunt is staying in Belville&#x27;s house. Florinda enters, sees Blunt and asks him for help. Blunt then attempts to rape her based on his new contempt for women. Frederick enters, also convinced that Florinda is a prostitute, and joins Blunt. Florinda gives them a diamond ring and asks them to consult Belville. Frederick fears that she might be a lady of some worth and asks Blunt to wait. Blunt is still skeptical but agrees. Frederick locks Florinda in a room.

===Act V===
Belville, Willmore, Frederick, and Pedro break into Blunt&#x27;s room and laugh at him. Blunt says that just a moment before there was a wench in his chamber and shows them the ring Florinda gave him. Belville recognizes the ring as the one he gave Florinda when they exchanged vows. The other men, unaware that the girl is Florinda, decide to let her out and have their way with her. They draw swords to see who has the longest. Don Pedro wins and unlocks Florinda&#x27;s door.

Florinda runs in, still masked and pursued by Pedro. She is saved when Valeria arrives and persuades Pedro to leave by telling him that Callis knows where Florinda is hiding. Once he is gone, Florinda removes her mask. Valeria tells Belville and Florinda to get married quickly, before Pedro returns. Frederick and Valeria decide to get married as well. Belville sends a boy to fetch a priest. Frederick and Blunt realise that they almost raped Florinda and apologise, returning the ring. Florinda forgives them. Belville, Florinda, Valeria, and Frederick exit to get married; Blunt goes off to see a tailor. Willmore stays behind to guard against Pedro&#x27;s return.

Angellica enters, pointing a pistol at Willmore; she rages at him while threatening him with the gun. Willmore offers to pay her for her services; she refuses. As she prepares to kill him, Don Antonio enters with his arm in a sling. He takes the gun from Angellica, then recognises Willmore as the man who stole Angellica&#x27;s picture. He offers to shoot Willmore. Pedro enters. Angellica decides to let Willmore live, and leaves. Don Pedro asks why Don Antonio missed the duel; Antonio tells him what happened, and leaves in a huff. Pedro decides to give Florinda to Belville in revenge. Willmore informs him that the marriage has already occurred. Pedro exits.

Hellena enters, still in boy&#x27;s clothes, and banters with Willmore, who wants to sleep with her but doesn&#x27;t want to marry her. Hellena finally convinces him for marriage. Pedro, Belville, Florinda, Frederick, and Valeria enter. They learn of Willmore and Hellena&#x27;s engagement and Pedro approves, tired of fearing for his sister&#x27;s honour (virginity). Blunt enters in a Spanish habit, looking ridiculous. Music plays and masquers from Carnival come in dancing. The play ends with vows of love between Hellena and Willmore.

==Background==

Having famously worked as a spy for Charles II against the Dutch, Behn lost her meagre income when the king refused to pay her expenses. She turned to writing for an income.

Behn was a Royalist, and her works frequently portray Puritans negatively. The subtitle &quot;Banish&#x27;d Cavaliers&quot; is a reference to the exile that the Cavalier forces experienced during the English Interregnum.

==Reception==

&quot;The Rover&quot; premiered in 1677 to such great success that Behn wrote a sequel that was produced in 1681. An extraordinarily popular example of Restoration comedy, the play earned an extended run, enabling Behn to make a fair income from it, receiving the proceeds from the box office every third night.

Willmore (who may have been a parallel to Charles II or John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester) proved to be an extremely popular character, and four years later Behn wrote a sequel to the play. King Charles II was himself a fan of &quot;The Rover&quot;, and received a private showing of the play.

Critic Susan Carlson argues that despite much of Behn&#x27;s work facing harsh criticism, &quot;The Rover&quot; was &quot;perhaps the least tarnished by critical contention over the originality of her work&quot;.

The play was later adapted by Mr. John Phillip Kemble in 1790 in a production called &quot;Love in Many Masks.&quot; Kemble&#x27;s version featured three acts instead of the normal five. This was not the only abbreviation applied to Behn&#x27;s original work. The final cut of Kemble&#x27;s piece saw most of the plot that was pertaining to sex, removed. Hellena&#x27;s speech on rape and unwanted marriage was left out, and the part of the plot relating to the near rape of Florinda by Willmore is only implied. Even though this version of Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;The Rover&quot; was much more polite and politically correct, it still received criticism that &quot;the ideas are constantly indelicate, and the language frequently gross.&quot; This resembled the reception that Behn&#x27;s &quot;Rover&quot; received as well, and resulted in &quot;The Rover&quot; disappearing from the stage until the late 1970s.

==Literary criticism==

Behn has been credited with an improvement in Killigrew&#x27;s &quot;indulgent and inert&quot; dialogue in the third act of the play.

Derek Hughes and Janet Todd critiqued the play in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Aphra Behn&quot;.

== Selected modern performances ==

<doc id="999267" wikidata="Q937353" url="?curid=999267" title="Echolalia">
<text>Echolalia is the unsolicited repetition of vocalizations made by another person; when repeated by the same person, it is called palilalia. In its profound form it is automatic and effortless. It is one of the echophenomena, closely related to echopraxia, the automatic repetition of movements made by another person; both are &quot;subsets of imitative behavior&quot; whereby sounds or actions are imitated &quot;without explicit awareness&quot;. Echolalia may be an immediate reaction to a stimulus or may be delayed.

Echolalia occurs in many cases of autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome. It may also occur in several other neurological conditions such as some forms of dementia or stroke-related aphasia.

The word &quot;echolalia&quot; is derived from the Greek (&quot;ēchō&quot;), meaning &quot;echo&quot; or &quot;to repeat&quot;, and (&quot;laliá&quot;) meaning &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;talk&quot; (of onomatopoeic origin, from the verb (&quot;laléo&quot;), meaning &quot;to talk&quot;).

==Signs and symptoms==
Echolalia can be categorized as either immediate (occurring immediately after the stimulus) or delayed (some time after the occurrence of a stimulus). Immediate echolalia results from quick recall of information from the short-term memory and &quot;superficial linguistic processing&quot;. A typical pediatric presentation of immediate echolalia might be as follows: a child is asked &quot;Do you want dinner?&quot;; the child echoes back &quot;Do you want dinner?&quot;, followed by a pause, and then a response, &quot;Yes. What&#x27;s for dinner?&quot; In delayed echolalia the patient repeats words, phrases, or multiple sentences after a delay that can be anywhere from hours to years later. Immediate echolalia can be indicative that a developmental disorder exists, but this is not necessarily the case. Sometimes echolalia can be observed when an individual echoes back a statement to indicate they are contemplating a response and fully heard the original statement.

&quot;Mitigated echolalia&quot; refers to a repetition in which the original stimulus is somewhat altered, and &quot;ambient echolalia&quot; refers to the repetition (typically occurring in individuals with dementia) of environmental stimuli such as a television program running in the background. 

Examples of mitigated echolalia are pronoun changes or syntax corrections. The first can be seen in the example of asking the patient &quot;Where are you going?&quot; and with patient responding &quot;Where am I going?&quot; The latter would be seen in the clinician asking &quot;Where am I going?&quot; and the patient repeating &quot;Where am I going?&quot; In mitigated echolalia some language processing is occurring. Mitigated echolalia can be seen in dyspraxia and aphasia of speech.

==Associated disorders==
Echolalia can be an indicator of communication disorders in autism, but is neither unique to, nor synonymous with syndromes. Echophenomena (particularly echolalia and echopraxia) were defining characteristics in the early descriptions of Tourette syndrome (TS). Echolalia also occurs in aphasia, schizophrenia, dementia, catatonia, epilepsy, after cerebral infarction (stroke), closed-head injury, in blind children, children with language impairments, as well as certain developing, non-challenged children. Other disorders associated with echolalia are Pick&#x27;s disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, as well as pervasive developmental disorder.

In transcortical sensory aphasia, echolalia is common, with the patient incorporating another person&#x27;s words or sentences into his or her own response. While these patients lack speech comprehension, they are still able to read.

== Anatomical correlates ==
Echolalia can be the result of left hemisphere damage. Specifically, damage to the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere has been linked to effortful echolalia. Cases of echolalia have appeared after lesions of the left medial frontal lobe and supplemental motor areas. Unintentional or nonfunctional echolalia shows similarities to imitation behavior seen after disinhibition of the frontal network and is most likely related to mirror neurons. In cases where echolalia is a part of mixed transitory aphasia, the perisylvian language area remains intact, but the surrounding anterior and posterior association cortexes degenerate or experience infarction.

== Imitation and learning ==
Echolalia is common in young children who are first learning to speak. Echolalia is a form of imitation. Imitation is a useful, normal and necessary component of social learning: &quot;imitative learning&quot; occurs when the &quot;observer acquires new behaviors through imitation&quot; and &quot;mimicry&quot; or &quot;automatic imitation&quot; occurs when a &quot;reenacted behavior is based on previously acquired motor (or vocal) patterns&quot;. Ganos &quot;et al&quot; (2012) define echolalia as an &quot;automatic imitative action without explicit awareness&quot;. Children often first babble syllables and eventually words they hear. For example, a baby may often hear the word &quot;bottle&quot; in various sentences. The baby first repeats with only syllables such as &quot;baba&quot; but as their language skills progress the child will eventually be able to say the word &quot;bottle&quot;. Echolalia becomes less and less common as a child&#x27;s language skills develop. It is not possible to distinguish the imitative learning form of echolalia that occurs as part of normal development from automatic imitation or echolalia characteristic of a disorder until about the age of three, when some ability for self-regulation is developed. A disorder may be suspected if automatic imitation persists beyond the age of three.

==Function==
Before the 1980s, echolalia was regarded as negative, non-functional behavior. However, researchers such as Barry Prizant and colleagues have emphasized the communicative function of echolalia. Among the communicative functions noted are turntaking, requesting, self-regulation and rehearsal to aid comprehension. Echolalia can be categorized as communicative (in context and with &quot;apparent communicative purpose&quot;) vs. semicommunicative (an &quot;unclear communicative meaning&quot;).

The use of echolalia in task response to facilitate generalization is an area that holds much promise. Research in this area is certainly needed. Marjorie H. Charlop performed a series of task experiments with autistic children. The results suggest that perhaps in certain tasks (i.e., receptive labeling), echolalia should not be eliminated, but taken advantage of as it may facilitate acquisition and generalization for autistic children.

=== Tourette syndrome ===
Echolalia and echopraxia are distinguishing tics of Tourette syndrome (TS); the echolalic repetitions of individuals with TS are mainly echoes from within their own &quot;tic repertoire&quot;. Evidence points to a healthy mirror neuron system (MNS), but &quot;inadequate imitation-control mechanism, which make them vulnerable to interferences&quot;.

=== Autism ===
A symptom of some autistic children is the struggle to produce spontaneous speech. Studies have shown that in some cases echolalia is used as a coping mechanism allowing an autistic person to contribute to a conversation when unable to produce spontaneous speech. Studies in the 1980s showed that there may be communicative intent with delayed echolalia, &quot;depending on the context in which it occurs&quot;; this research on autistic children &quot;raised questions related to behavior modification programs that defended the revocation or replacement of immediate echolalia&quot;.

Uta Frith, Prizant and others have interpreted echolalia as evidence of &quot;gestalt&quot; processing in autistic children, including in the acquisition of language. However, a 1990 study on the acquisition of grammar by Tager-Flusberg and Calkins found that echolalia did not facilitate grammatical development in autistic children.

<text>John Streeter Manifold (21 April 1915 – 19 April 1985) was an Australian poet and critic. He was born in Melbourne, into a well known Camperdown family. He was educated at Geelong Grammar School, and read modern languages at Jesus College, Cambridge. While in Cambridge he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was involved in an attempt to create a successor (&quot;Poetry and the People&quot;) to &quot;Left Review&quot;, when the latter folded in 1938.

He then worked in Germany, in publishing. During World War II, he served in intelligence in the British Army, in the Middle East, Africa and France. He was a published war poet; &quot;Trident&quot;, with Hubert Nicholson and David Martin, was published by Randall Swingler&#x27;s Fore Publications in 1944.

In 1949, he returned to Australia, settling in Brisbane. He was a founder in 1950 of the Realist Writers Group. He then worked and published mostly on Australian songs and music, reciting ballads at arts festivals. In the 1984 Australia Day Honours, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;service to literature as a poet and musician&quot;. He died in Brisbane.

<text>.an was the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the former Netherlands Antilles. It was administered by the University of the Netherlands Antilles. The domain was phased out after the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved in 2010. As of November 2010 the .an domain remained live with over 800 domains registered under .an, including secondary levels. On 31 July 2015, use of the domain was discontinued.

==Second level domain==
Including google.com.an and youtube.com.an (both delegations to Google&#x27;s nameservers), yahoo.com.an (delegated to Yahoo&#x27;s nameservers but no A record for yahoo.com.an or www.yahoo.com.an), and visa.com.an (delegation to ultradns.net&#x27;s nameservers). With the deletion of AN from the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 register the ISO codes CW (Curaçao), SX (Sint Maarten) and BQ (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba), the ccTLDs .cw, .sx and .bq have been designated (although the last one is not in use).

==Phasing out==
On 31 December 2013, the University of the Netherlands Antilles began removing inactive .an domain names from their databases and systems. On 31 October 2014, ICANN removed the .an domain from the DNS root servers.

<doc id="999287" wikidata="Q1700480" url="?curid=999287" title="John Holmes (Maine politician)">
<text>John Holmes (March 14, 1773 – July 7, 1843) was an American politician. He served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and was one of the first two U.S. senators from Maine. Holmes was noted for his involvement in the Treaty of Ghent.

==Biography==
Holmes was born in Kingston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and attended public schools in Kingston. In 1796, he graduated from the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the former name of Brown University) in Providence, Rhode Island. Holmes studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799, opening a law practice in Alfred in Massachusetts&#x27; District of Maine. At this time, he was also engaged in literary pursuits.

==Career==
Holmes, a Democratic-Republican, was elected to the Massachusetts General Court in 1802, 1803, and 1812. He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1813 and 1814.

In 1816, Holmes was one of the commissioners under the Treaty of Ghent to divide the islands of Passamaquoddy Bay between the United States and Great Britain. He was also appointed by the legislature to organize state prisons and revise the Massachusetts criminal code.

Holmes was elected as a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1816, serving from March 4, 1817, to his resignation on March 15, 1820. During the 16th Congress, Holmes served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State. Holmes supported William H. Crawford, (a &quot;Crawford Republican&quot;), and John Quincy Adams. He was opposed to Andrew Jackson (an &quot;Anti-Jackson&quot;).

Holmes supported the Missouri Compromise, and was praised by Thomas Jefferson for his pamphlet &quot;Mr. Holmes&#x27;s Letter to the People of Maine&quot;. In the letter, Jefferson thanks Holmes for a copy of this pamphlet. This pamphlet defends Holmes&#x27;s position on supporting the Missouri Compromise—the admission of Maine as a free state with the admission of Missouri as a slave state, which was an unpopular position in Maine. Jefferson himself rejected the compromise:

But this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. it is hushed indeed for the moment. but this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. a geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. (...) An abstinence too from this act of power would remove the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress, to regulate the condition of the different descriptions of men composing a state. this certainly is the exclusive right of every state, which nothing in the constitution has taken from them and given to the general government. could congress, for example say that the Non-freemen of Connecticut, shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate into any other state?
:— Letter by Thomas Jefferson to John Holmes, April 22, 1820
Holmes was later a delegate to the Maine Constitutional Convention. Upon separation from Massachusetts and the admission of Maine as a state, he was elected to the United States Senate and served from June 13, 1820, to March 3, 1827. Holmes was again elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Albion Parris, serving from January 15, 1829, to March 3, 1833. During the 17th Congress, Holmes served as chairman of the Committee on Finance (1821–1822); during the 21st Congress, Holmes was chairman of the Committee on Pensions.

After leaving the Senate, Holmes resumed his law practice. From 1836 to 1837, he was a member of the Maine House of Representatives. In 1841, Holmes was appointed as the United States Attorney for the District of Maine, a post he held until his death in Portland on July 7, 1843.

==Death and legacy==
Holmes was interred in a private tomb of Cotton Brooks, Eastern Cemetery.

In 1840, Holmes published &quot;The Statesman, Or Principles of Legislation and Law&quot;, a law book.

<text>Tin Planet is the second studio album by English band Space, released on 9 March 1998.

Recorded in late 1997 following a tumultuous year for the group, &quot;Tin Planet&quot; was a continuation of the eclectic blend of musical styles explored on their debut album &quot;Spiders&quot;. However, it was noted that the more abrasive aspects of their sound were toned down considerably from their debut, with the songs being more melodic with a prominent cabaret and easy listening influence. Keyboardist Franny Griffiths&#x27; love of techno and electronic music was also brought to the fore, culminating in three tracks that were primarily dance-orientated.

The album was the first Space record to feature long-time collaborator David &quot;Yorkie&quot; Palmer as full-time bassist, and the last to feature founding member Andy Parle on drums (though he was not credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes), with Leon Caffrey (formerly of the band Proper) taking his place shortly afterwards.

&quot;Tin Planet&quot; peaked at #3 in the UK charts, two places higher than &quot;Spiders&quot;. It was their first album to enter the Australian ARIA top 100 albums chart, debuting on 24 May 1998 and peaking at #74 the following week. The album peaked at #11 in New Zealand in May 1998. The songs &quot;Avenging Angels&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot; (a duet with Cerys Matthews of the band Catatonia), &quot;Begin Again&quot; and &quot;Bad Days&quot; were released as singles, all hitting the UK top 40.

==Background==
In 1996, Space released their debut album &quot;Spiders&quot; on Gut Records. Combining surreal, darkly humorous lyrics and a large number of styles and genres, including rock, techno, hip hop and funk, a result of the different musical tastes of the band members, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and becoming certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996 for sales of over 300,000. Nonetheless, in mid-1997, during their tour of the United States, where the band began to find minor success, numerous personal problems hit the band. The band were constantly under stress, which reached such an extent that keyboardist Franny Griffiths developed an ulcer, lyricist and vocalist Tommy Scott lost his voice and the band&#x27;s guitarist and other lyricist and vocalist, Jamie Murphy, &quot;still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk.&quot;

Murphy ultimately missed many of the band&#x27;s live shows and television appearances. Though widely rumoured to have depressingly watched Space perform &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on television, one of the performances he missed, he was in fact preoccupied with other things and &quot;actually forgotten the single was even out.&quot; Scott was terrified that his singing voice was permanently lost, as the cause with originally unknown; he underwent cancer treatment to make sure, but it turns out his voice was lost due to stress, and he soon recovered. Murphy also soon recovered and rejoined the band in time for the recording of &quot;Tin Planet&quot;. Scott explained, &quot;Me losing my voice turned out to be the best thing because everyone had two months off so everyone got their heads together. Jamie got better and then everything happened naturally. I went to see Jamie and he was all right - a lot better - so we forgave him.&quot; However, throughout the writing and recording of the album, the band felt they were of an uncertain future and were in a darker environment than before.

In late 1997, just prior to the recording of &quot;Tin Planet&quot;, the band&#x27;s old friend, Dave &quot;Yorkie&quot; Palmer, joined the group. He has already contributed backing to vocals on &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits from &quot;Spiders&quot;, and was involved in the production of several of the album&#x27;s B-sides, but he was asked to join the band proper as their full-time bassist, which allowed Scott to focus on his vocals. However, shortly after Palmer had joined the band, the death of his mother Gladys Palmer, a Liverpudlian singer who owned the rehearsal rooms Space practised in, came as a devastation to the group. Her death brought a &quot;tinge of sadness&quot; to the recording sessions.

==Recording==


The band recorded &quot;Tin Planet&quot; in late 1997 and early 1998 at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, the same studio that they recorded &quot;Spiders&quot; in. The album was also mixed and mastered at the studio. Although Murphy had rejoined the band, he was often distracted by other occurrences, and Scott in fact played a majority of the guitars present on the record, although this was not the result of a band rift; as &quot;it&#x27;s accepted that when in the studio, whoever&#x27;s around will play whatever&#x27;s at hand,&quot; and &quot;Tommy and Jamie have both played everything.&quot; Scott, the main lyricist for the band, wrote many of the album&#x27;s songs on guitar, &quot;so it makes sense for me to play them. But it&#x27;s good to have Jamie&#x27;s angle on things &#x27;cos I like my jazz chords and Jamie loves to stick his distortion on and play straight rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

Scott used Fender Pro Reverb and Vox AC30 amplifiers on the album, and his Fender Coronado guitar, the only guitar that he owned at the time. Scott, less phased with guitar &quot;snobbery&quot; than Murphy, explained, &quot;to be honest, I prefer to put my guitar straight into the desk and I use pedals or the desk&#x27;s own effects. Sometimes all this snobbery about amps is a load of bullshit. For instance, the AC30 I used was crap!&quot; In an interview, when Griffiths commented that &quot;people think that if they use the same equipment at The Beatles, then their music&#x27;s going to sound to the same. But it&#x27;s all about the vibe created on the day,&quot; Scott added that &quot;Jamie&#x27;s a sucker for all that shit. He&#x27;s got his twin Marshalls and his six million effects on stage, but he&#x27;s living the whole lifestyle, bless &#x27;im.&quot;

Two guest musicians played on the album; flautist Ben Roberts and percussionist Ged Lynch. The record was co-produced and engineered by Jeremy Wheatley, with assistance from Andrea Wright and Dave Buchanan. Wheatley had previously engineered most of the tracks from &quot;Spiders&quot;. Very shortly after the completion of the album, but prior to its release, drummer Andy Parle left the band, instantly being replaced by Leon Caffrey, formerly of Proper. Parle had become a &quot;latent casualty&quot;, which was ironic as he was the healthiest member during the band&#x27;s period of problems. Caffrey had been a friend of the group for a long time, and made his debut with the band in the promotion of &quot;Tin Planet&quot;.

For &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot;, Cerys Matthews of the Welsh band Catatonia, who Space had supported live back in 1996, was brought in to duet with Scott, which fueled rumours in the press that the two were linked romantically, when in fact they were just good friends. Yorkie provided the scratch-track for Matthews&#x27; vocals in the song&#x27;s demo.

==Artwork==
Mike Badger, a Liverpool-based musician and fine art sculptor, as well as a founding member of The La&#x27;s, was commissioned by the band to create the visuals for &quot;Tin Planet&quot;, as they wanted a local artist that they knew personally to work with them. At the time, the band did not have a title for the record. Badger had been constructing sculptures out of scrapped metal objects and appliances shaped to look like aliens and robots, and was planning to use them for an animated Super 8 film he was working on with Paul Simpson in their spare time, entitled &quot;Tin Planet&quot;. The film eventually never got finished, but the band realised that the name was a perfect fit for the album, and without haste Badger granted them permission to use it.

Badger found producing the artwork challenging, as he discovered at the last minute that each individual piece of the robot sculpture were being photographed separately, resembling an Airfix model kit, before it was being assembled, whereas he had presumed that only the finished sculpture would be shot. The completed robot ended up appearing on the back of the sleeve, and was donated by Badger in 2011 to be exhibited at the Museum of Liverpool. Badger would also go on to produce the covers for the &quot;Avenging Angels&quot; and &quot;Begin Again&quot; singles, as well as the music video for &quot;Avenging Angels&quot; and a television commercial promoting the album.

Alongside the standard CD packaging, earlier limited editions of &quot;Tin Planet&quot; came with a special metallic tin packaging.

==Reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Tin Planet&quot; was met with critical and commercial acclaim, receiving a rare five-star rating from &quot;Q Magazine&quot;, although some critics were still eager to peg them as a novelty act. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Avenging Angels&quot; was made NME&#x27;s Single of the Week. Allmusic&#x27;s Jason Damas noted how, &quot;before the release of &quot;Tin Planet&quot;, lead vocalist Tommy Scott made reference to the album as being one of the finest pop records ever made.&quot; Later reflections on the album have been mixed, with bandmembers voicing their disappointment with the slicker sound compared to &quot;Spiders&quot;, and feeling that their label Gut Records were trying to manipulate them into becoming, in their words, &quot;the next Beautiful South&quot;.

==Aftermath==
After touring and promotional commitments of &quot;Tin Planet&quot; concluded in late 1998, Space returned to the studio to commence work on their third album, tentatively titled &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;. However, Gut Records objected to Edwyn Collins being chosen as producer, and forced the band to rework the material several times, delaying its release for over two years until it was eventually scrapped in July 2001. By that time the band had terminated their contract with Gut and Jamie Murphy, who was growing restless and distant from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. &quot;Love You More than Football&quot; now primilarly exists as a bootleg, due to a promotional copy on CD-R which circulated around May 2000.

As a result, Space, now reduced to a four-piece, laid low for a couple of years, sporadically releasing several songs as a free-to-download MP3s through their website, becoming one of the first major groups to do so. However, they did not release another studio album proper until &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;, which was recorded in 2002 and released through RandM Records in 2004.

On August 19, 2022, &quot;Tin Planet&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time through Demon Records. It entered at #25 on the Official UK Vinyl Album Charts.

<doc id="999297" wikidata="Q4470194" url="?curid=999297" title="George Washington Whistler">
<text>George Washington Whistler (May 19, 1800 – April 7, 1849) was an American civil engineer best known for building steam locomotives and railroads. He is credited with introducing the steam whistle to American locomotives.

In 1842, Tsar Nicholas I hired him to build the Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway, Russia&#x27;s first large-scale railroad. One of Whistler&#x27;s important influences was the introduction of the Howe truss for the Russian railroad&#x27;s bridges. This inspired the renowned Russian engineer Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii to perform studies and develop structural analysis techniques for Howe truss bridges.

He was the father of American artist James McNeill Whistler, whose painting &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; (of his second wife Anna Whistler) is among the most famous paintings in American art.

==Early life and family==
George Washington Whistler was born on May 19, 1800, at the military outpost of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Major John Whistler (1756–1829) and his wife Anna Bishop. Ft. Wayne at that time was a part of the great Northwest Territory. His father had been a British soldier under General Burgoyne at the Battles of Saratoga in the Revolutionary War, later to enlist in American service.

Whistler had three children with his first wife, Mary Roberdeau Swift, who died at a young age in 1827. Whistler then married the sister of his friend William Gibbs McNeill (1801–1853), Anna Mathilda McNeill (1804–1881), with whom he had five sons: James Abbott McNeill Whistler, William McNeill Whistler (1836–1900), Kirk Boott (1838–1842) named after Kirk Boott, Charles Donald Whistler (1841–1843), and John Bouttatz Whistler (1845–1846), named after Whistler&#x27;s Russian engineer friend Major Ivan F. Bouttatz. Whistler and William Gibbs McNeil lived in Fisher Ames&#x27; house while working on the Boston and Providence Railroad.

==Education and career==
Whistler graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1819. Upon graduation, Whistler was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Artillery serving as a topography engineer at Fort Columbus, New York, from 1819 to 1821. When the Army was reorganized in 1821, he became a Second Lieutenant in the First Artillery. From 1821 to 1822, Whistler was an Assistant Professor of Drawing at West Point.

Whistler was reassigned back to artillery corps duty as a topographical engineer in 1822, his first assignment was supporting the Commission tracing the international boundary between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods. Subsequent to the passage of the General Survey Act of 1824, Whistler later conducted surveys for locating railroads working under John James Abert, the head of the Topographic Bureau.

===Baltimore and Ohio railroad===
In 1827, Whistler&#x27;s brother-in-law and fellow engineer William Gibbs McNeill became a member of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad&#x27;s &quot;Board of Civil Engineers for the Construction of the Road&quot; (1827‑30). Still on active duty, Whistler joined the railroad&#x27;s engineer corps the next year in 1828. Together, Whistler, McNeill, and Jonathan Knight went to Great Britain to study railroad engineering, where they were welcomed by President Telford, of the British Institution of Civil Engineers, where they also met with George Stephenson and son Robert Stephenson, John Walker, Joseph Locke, Jesse Hartley, and other eminent British engineers. They also saw the British railroad, the Stockton and Darlington, the world&#x27;s first public railway to use steam locomotives. As one observer wrote:
Whistler supervised construction of the first rails on the railroad in October 1829, consisting of wood and iron from Pratt Street to the Carrollton Viaduct. The railroad&#x27;s future road master, Wendel Bollman, helped with the construction layout as a fifteen-year-old carpenter.

===Other railroads===
In 1830, McNeill and Whistler entered the service of the Baltimore and Susquehanna railroad, Whistler remaining on the project for the first 20 miles of main and branch track had been completed. In 1831‑32, Whistler provided engineering services for the Paterson and Hudson River railroad (now southern terminus of Erie) Railroad; and in 1833‑34, upon the Providence and Stonington Railroad.
Whistler resigned his army engineer commission in December 1833. In 1835, along with William Gibbs McNeill, Whistler designed the Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, which included the famous Canton Viaduct which has been in continuous service for 174 years.

===Locomotive designer and builder===
In 1834, Whistler became chief engineer at the Proprietors of Locks and Canals in the new city of Lowell, Massachusetts. Whistler was one of the few locomotive designers and builders in the early 19th century that had an academic education. As superintendent of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals Co. water powered machine shop in Lowell (1834–1837), Whistler was responsible for the design of the earliest steam locomotive built in New England. In 1835, he worked with Patrick Tracy Jackson to begin the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad.

Whistler&#x27;s first locomotive, the Patrick, was produced for the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad. This locomotive and others built by the firm were initially copies of Stephenson Planet types (2-2-0s). In 1836, the first two steam locomotives known to have been equipped with whistles were built by Whistler as 2-2-0 types; the Hicksville for the Long Island Railroad and the Susquehanna for the Wilmington &amp; Susquehanna Railroad. In 1838, Baltimore and Ohio railroad engineers Knight and Latrobe surveyed steam locomotives for their management, some of which included machines built in Whistler&#x27;s Lowell shops.

Whistler built three machines for the Boston and Providence Rail Road, they were almost 9 tons in gross weight and 6 tons in weight on the five foot driving wheels, a 2-4-0 configuration. These machines had 11 inch cylinders with a 16 inch stroke. Whistler also built one locomotive for the New Jersey and Patterson Rail Road weighing 8 tons gross. Whistler left Lowell in 1837 and was followed by his apprentice, James B Francis. The Lowell Machine Shop&#x27;s locomotive production continued until 1854.

===Western railroad (Massachusetts)===
 Soon after Whistler&#x27;s work on the Stonington Railroad he was engaged to consult on the Western railroad again with McNeill from 1836 to 1842. In October 1839, the road&#x27;s Board of Directors hired Whistler as its Chief engineer.

The main problem in locating the railroad were the steep grades west of the Westfield River, a major tributary of the Connecticut River, which were in excess of 80 feet to the mile, (actually 1.65%. west of Chester, Massachusetts). At that time in 1842, there was no known locomotive that could deliver the tractive effort to climb that grade. The first locomotives purchased for the road in 1842 were Ross Winan&#x27;s &quot;crabs&quot; or 0-8-0s which could not handle the grade. Whistler substituted Stephenson Planet types (2-2-0s) which delivered satisfactory service.

===Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway===

Tsar Nicholas I invited Whistler to help build the Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway, which would be Russia&#x27;s first major railroad.

Although the Tsarskoye Selo Railway, built by Germany&#x27;s Franz Anton Ritter von Gerstner in 1837, was Russia&#x27;s first public railway line, the cost overruns led Tsar Nicholas I and his advisors to doubt Gerstner&#x27;s ability to execute the planned St. Petersburg–Moscow line. So two professors from St. Petersburg&#x27;s Institute of the Corps of Transportation Engineers, Pavel Petrovich Melnikov and Nikolai Osipovich Kraft, traveled to the United States in 1839 to study railroad technology. Melnikov and Kraft spoke with Whistler and recommended that the Russian government retain Whistler as a consulting engineer on the Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway, and Whistler was given a seven-year contract.

Whistler left for Russia in June 1842, accompanied by imperial engineer Major Ivan F. Bouttatz, who would become Whistler&#x27;s friend. He received the Order of Saint Anna by the Russian Emperor in 1847 but contracted cholera and died on April 7, 1849, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, two years before the line was completed.

==Professional associations==
Whistler was part of the first efforts to form a national engineering association in the United States, although unsuccessful, it was thirteen years ahead of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects, which was co-founded in 1852 by his nephew Julius Walker Adams. There was an organizational meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1839 that elected Benjamin Latrobe as its president. The organizing committee included some of the most prominent and representative engineers of the day such as: J. B. Jervis and Benjamin Wright of New York, Moncure Robinson and Claude Crozet of Virginia, Jonathan Knight of Maryland, J. Edgar Thomson then in Georgia, later in Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Whistler&#x27;s stone arch railroad bridges built in 1841 are still in freight and passenger service on the CSX mainline in western Massachusetts. He was the first civil engineer in America to use contour lines to show elevation and relief on maps.

<doc id="999303" wikidata="Q1575043" url="?curid=999303" title="Handicap (golf)">
<text>A golf handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer&#x27;s ability, or potential ability, that is used to enable players of different abilities to compete against one another. Better players are those with the lowest handicaps.

Historically, rules relating to handicaps have varied from country to country with many different systems in force around the world. Because of incompatibilities and difficulties in translating between systems, the sport&#x27;s governing bodies, the USGA and The R&amp;A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new World Handicap System (WHS) which began to be introduced globally in 2020. 

==History==
The earliest record of golf handicapping is thought to be from the late 17th century, in a diary kept by Thomas Kincaid, who was a student in Edinburgh, Scotland, although the word &quot;handicap&quot; would not come into use in golf until the late 19th century. The number of strokes to be given and the holes on which they would be in effect was negotiated between competing golfers prior to the start of play. According to &quot;The Golfer&#x27;s Manual&quot; by Henry Brougham Farnie, examples of agreed terms included &quot;third-one&quot; (one stroke every three holes), &quot;half-one&quot; (one stroke every two holes), &quot;one more&quot; (a stroke a hole) and &quot;two more&quot; (two strokes a hole).

During the late 19th century, taking the difference between the average of a golfer&#x27;s best three scores during the year and par became the most widely used method of handicapping in England and Scotland. As the sport grew, so did discontent with the fairness of handicapping, with less proficient players being particularly unhappy as it was much less likely for them to play to the standard of their three-score average. Another issue was the lack of consideration in the system for the varying difficulties of different courses which meant the handicap was not very portable.

In an attempt to remedy the problems with a fairly basic handicap system, along with many variations of that system and other systems also being used, the authorities in Great Britain and Ireland sought to standardize. One of the first standard and equitable handicap systems was introduced by the Ladies Golf Union (LGU) in the 1890s. This was largely achieved by means of union-assigned course ratings, instead of clubs using their own. It was not until the formation of the British Golf Unions Joint Advisory Committee in 1924 that the men&#x27;s game fully coordinated to create an equitable handicap system, that included a uniform course rating, throughout Great Britain and Ireland; the &quot;Standard Scratch Score and Handicapping Scheme&quot; was introduced in 1926.

In the United States there was a single authority governing the sport, the USGA, which made moving to a single standard handicapping scheme somewhat easier. Introduced in 1911, the first national handicap system was based on the British three-score average system. The biggest development was a &quot;par rating&quot; system that assessed the average good score of a scratch golfer on every course, which made the handicap more portable. It also made clear that a player&#x27;s handicap was intended to reflect their potential rather than average play. Having initially allowed clubs to determine their own par ratings, the USGA quickly changed their minds and began assigning ratings. The USGA Handicap System has further developed through the years, with an increase in the number of scores used for handicap calculations, the introduction of Equitable Stroke Control, and improvements to the course rating system. However the most significant change was the creation of the slope rating system, which enables handicaps to allow for differences in difficulty between scratch and bogey golfers. USGA Course and Slope Ratings now form the basis of many other handicap systems.

As the sport grew globally, associations around the world each created or adapted their own rules relating to handicaps. By the early 21st century, there were six major recognized handicapping systems in operation around the world: USGA Handicap System, EGA Handicap System, CONGU Unified Handicap System, Golf Australia Handicap System, South African Handicap System, and Argentinian Handicap System. While these systems share some common features, e.g. most use a common course rating system, they are not easily portable because their differences create difficulties in converting handicaps between systems. In order to eliminate these problems the USGA and The R&amp;A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new &quot;World Handicap System&quot; which was phased in globally in 2020.

==Overview==
Amateur golfers who are members of golf clubs are generally eligible for official handicaps on payment of the prevailing regional and national association annual fees. Official handicaps are administered by golf clubs with the associations often providing additional peer reviewing for low handicaps. Other systems, often free of charge, are available to golfers who are ineligible for official handicaps. Handicap systems are not generally used in professional golf. A golfer whose handicap is zero is referred to as a scratch golfer, and one whose handicap is approximately 18 as a bogey golfer.

While the USGA administers its own handicapping system, the administration of handicapping systems in countries affiliated to The R&amp;A is the responsibility of the national golf associations of those countries. These bodies have different methods of producing handicaps but they are all generally based on calculating an individual player&#x27;s playing ability from their recent history of rounds. Therefore, a handicap is not fixed but is regularly adjusted to increases or decreases in a player&#x27;s scoring. Some systems (e.g. World Handicap System, USGA, European Golf Association) involve calculation of a playing handicap which is dependent on the course being played and set of tees that are being used, whereas others (e.g. CONGU&#x27;s Unified Handicap System) just use the allocated handicap rounded to the nearest whole number.

Contrary to popular opinion, a player&#x27;s handicap is intended to reflect a player&#x27;s potential or &quot;average best&quot;, not a player&#x27;s overall average score. Statistically, low handicappers will play to their handicap more often because they are likely to be more consistent than higher handicappers.

==Features of handicapping systems==
===Scoring===
The total number of strokes taken for a hole (or round) before accounting for a golfer&#x27;s handicap is called the &quot;gross score&quot; for that hole (or round), and the number of strokes taken after subtracting any handicap allowance is called the &quot;net score&quot;. 

Note that the &quot;gross score&quot; in &#x27;world handicap system&#x27; is calculated as the number of strokes taken for a hole &quot;+ the handicap allowance for that hole&quot;. The &quot;adjusted gross score&quot; in &#x27;world handicap system&#x27; is the &quot;gross score&quot; adjusted such that the maximum on any particular hole is the number of strokes taken for a hole + the handicap allowance for that hole + 2 strokes (i.e. net double bogey). 

In handicap stroke play competitions, a golfer&#x27;s playing handicap is subtracted from the total number of strokes taken to produce a net score, which is then used to determine the final results. In handicap Stableford competitions, a player&#x27;s handicap is distributed according to predetermined hole ratings (stroke index) and strokes deducted accordingly from each hole score before calculating the points for that hole. In match play, the handicap difference between players (or teams) is used to determine the number of strokes the high handicap player should receive from the low handicapper during the playing of their round; each of these strokes are received on the lowest numbered stroke index holes. Stroke allowances may sometimes be reduced by a set percentage in order to maintain the level playing field; this is especially common in pairs and team competitions.

===Course Rating===
Course Rating, (Standard) Scratch Score, Scratch Rating, and Standard Rating are largely equivalent ratings that are used to indicate the average &quot;good score&quot; by a scratch golfer for a set of tees on a golf course. For a par 72 course, the course rating is generally between 67 and 77. There are different methods of calculating the Course Rating, with the length of the course and its obstacles being the biggest factors. Some systems use only these two, or even length alone, but most modern handicapping systems now use the &quot;USGA Course Rating&quot; system which assesses the difficulty of all aspects of the course, e.g. altitude, wide or narrow fairways, length of any rough, the size and contours of the greens, etc.

Some handicapping systems provide for an adjustment to the course rating to account for variations in playing conditions on any given day, e.g. course setup and weather, and it is against this adjusted rating that handicaps are assessed and maintained. Examples of adjusted ratings are Playing Conditions Calculation (World Handicap System), Competition Scratch Score (CONGU Unified Handicapping System), Daily Scratch Rating (Golf Australia Handicap System), and Calculated Rating (South African Handicap System).

Analogous to course rating is the bogey rating, which is a measure of the playing difficulty of a course for a bogey golfer.

===Slope Rating===

Devised by the USGA, the Slope Rating of a golf course describes the relative difficulty of a course for a bogey golfer compared to a scratch golfer. Slope Ratings are in the range 55 to 155, with a course of standard relative difficulty having a rating of 113; the higher the number, the more relatively difficult the course is.

===Playing or course handicap===
In most major handicapping systems, a golfer does not use their exact handicap (or handicap index) directly, but use it to produce their playing or course handicap. For some systems, this means simply rounding the exact handicap to the nearest whole number; however, systems that use slope ratings require a more complex calculation to produce a course handicap with some also factoring in the course rating:

:formula_1
or
:formula_2

The USGA and Golf Australia systems use the first calculation; the WHS, EGA, and Golf RSA systems use the second. Under CONGU&#x27;s Unified Handicapping System the exact handicap is rounded to the nearest whole number to produce the playing handicap, and in the Argentinian system the exact handicap is used directly.

A playing handicap may also refer to the stroke allowance for a given competition dependent on playing format, and is generally calculated as a percentage of the course handicap.

===Stroke Index===

The Stroke Index is a number that has been assigned to each hole on a golf course, and usually printed on the scorecard, to indicate on which holes handicap strokes should be applied. On an 18-hole course, each hole is assigned a different number from 1 to 18 (1 to 9 on a 9-hole course). The lowest numbers are usually given to the holes where a higher handicapper is most likely to benefit, and the highest numbers to the holes they are least likely to benefit. Odd numbers will be allocated to either the first or second 9-holes (and even numbers to the other) to ensure a balanced distribution of handicap strokes, and guidelines generally recommend avoiding having the lowest numbers at the start or end of each nine in order to prevent early stroke allowances in playoffs between golfers with similar handicaps or strokes going unused if they are at the end.

===Maximum hole score===

Most of the commonly used handicap systems seek to reduce the impact of very high scores on one or more individual holes on the calculation and updating of handicaps. This is achieved by setting a maximum score on each hole, which is only used for handicapping purposes; i.e. it is not used for determining results of competitions or matches. This &quot;maximum hole score&quot; is either a fixed number or a net score relative to par. &quot;Equitable Stroke Control&quot; (ESC) and &quot;net double bogey&quot; (also called Stableford Points Adjustments) are the two most common mechanisms for defining a maximum hole score.

===Handicap differential===
Handicap (or score) differentials are a feature of many handicapping systems. They are a standardized measure of a golfers performance, adjusted to take account of the course being played. Normally the overall score will be adjusted prior to the calculation, e.g. by means of ESC or net double bogey. The course rating may also be adjusted to take account of conditions on the day.

For handicapping systems that use course and slope ratings, a typical calculation using the &quot;score&quot; (see above) is as follows:

:formula_3

The differentials are used both to calculate initial handicaps and maintain existing ones, by taking a mean average of a set number of the best recent differentials (e.g. the USGA system uses the best 10 differentials from the last 20 scores).

For other handicapping systems, the differentials are simply the difference between the (adjusted) gross or net scores and a specified standard rating (e.g. course rating, standard scratch score, etc.), and they are used in different ways to maintain handicaps.

===Peer review===
In golf clubs, peer review is usually managed by an elected Handicap Secretary who, supported by a small committee, conducts an Annual Review of the handicaps of all members and assesses ad hoc requests from individual members (usually when age or medium to long-term infirmity affects their playing ability). This gives uniformity to handicapping across their club for the setting and maintenance of handicaps with the objective of establishing fair competition between golfers of all abilities.

At the regional level, peer review is extended to include rigorous validation of the handicap returns of low handicap golfers. This ensures that only golfers of an appropriate standard gain entry to their elite tournaments. Occasionally, golfers are excluded from the elite game as a consequence of being found to abuse the system. To a degree, these regional bodies also monitor the performance of and provide training for Handicap Secretaries at the club level.

Nationally, the peer review is extended further to assessing golfers from external jurisdictions for their suitability for entry into their elite international events. They also play a large part in periodic reviews of the handicapping system itself to improve it for the future.

==Handicapping systems==
===World Handicap System===
Due to the many different handicapping systems in use around the world, and the many inconsistencies within them, which makes it difficult to compete on an equal footing where another handicap system is in use, the sports major governing bodies, in 2011 The R&amp;A and the USGA began work on creation of a single uniform handicapping system to be used everywhere. In February 2018, they announced that the World Handicap System (WHS) would be launched in 2020. Once introduced, the World Handicap System will continue to be governed by The R&amp;A and the USGA with the six existing major handicapping authorities (the USGA, the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) in Great Britain and Ireland, the European Golf Association (EGA), Golf Australia, the South African Golf Association (SAGA), and the Argentine Golf Association (AAG)) administering the system at a local level.

The WHS is based on the USGA Course and Slope Rating system, and largely follows the USGA Handicap System while also incorporating features from the six major existing handicap systems. For example, 8 differentials (like the Golf Australia system) are used after net double bogey adjustments (like the CONGU and EGA systems) for handicap calculations, and the WHS course/playing handicap includes a course rating adjustment (like the EGA system). For players with current handicaps, their handicap records in the old systems will be used to produce WHS handicaps; the expectation is that most players will at most see a difference of one or two strokes, if any.

A new WHS handicap requires several scores to be submitted; the recommendation is a minimum of 54 holes made up of any number of 9 or 18-hole rounds in order to achieve a reasonable fair and accurate result, although handicaps may be issued from a smaller sample. Handicap adjustments will be made upon submission of any 9 or 18-hole scores with updates published daily; unlike some other systems both competitive and recreational rounds may be submitted by all players (e.g. CONGU&#x27;s Unified Handicapping System only allows submission of non-qualifying scores by golfers in Category 2 or above). Ongoing handicaps are based on the average of the best 8 differentials, but with an &quot;anchor&quot; to prevent rapid increases that would not necessarily reflect the player&#x27;s true potential. There is also a hole limit of &quot;net double bogey&quot; for handicapping purposes in order to prevent one or two bad holes from having a disproportionate effect.

====World Handicap System overview====
A WHS handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that approximates how many strokes above or below par a player might be able to play, based on the eight best scores of their last twenty rounds. The calculation has several variables, including: the player&#x27;s scores from their most recent rounds, the course rating, and the slope rating.

A score differential is calculated from each of the scores after any net double bogey adjustments (an adjustment which allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player&#x27;s course handicap) have been applied, using the following formula:
:formula_4
:formula_5

Only 18-hole differentials are used for the calculation of a handicap index. As such, 9-hole differentials need to be combined before being used, subject to remaining one of the 20 most recent differentials. The system also allows for situations where less than 18 (or 9) hole have been played, subject to a minimum of 14 (or 7) holes having been completed, by &quot;scaling up&quot; with net pars for any missing holes.

The score differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the best 8 from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged and rounded to one decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are calculated from a minimum of five scores using adjustments that limit each hole score to a maximum of formula_6. If there are at least 5 but fewer than 20 qualifying scores available, the handicap index is calculated using a set number or differentials according to how many scores are available, with an additional adjustment made to that average in some circumstances.

The basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result rounded to one decimal place:
:formula_8

The handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set of tees being used with an adjustment based on the difference between the course rating and par. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number. For competitions, the unrounded course handicap is converted to a playing handicap by applying a handicap allowance, dependent on the format of play.

:formula_9

The WHS contains measures reduce a handicap index more quickly in the case of exceptional scoring, and also to prevent a handicap index from rising too quickly. This is done by means of &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; caps based on the lowest index during the previous 365 days; the soft cap reduces increases above 3.0 to 50%, and the hard cap limits increases to 5.0. Updates to a golfer&#x27;s handicap index are issued daily.

Many elements of WHS have flexibility which allows for local authorities to determine their own settings, but the basic handicap index calculation remains the same. Examples include: 9-hole scores may be scaled-up rather than combined; formula_10 may be omitted from the course handicap calculation; and the rounded course handicap may be used in the playing handicap calculation.

===USGA Handicap System===
The first handicap system to be introduced by the USGA was largely the work of Leighton Calkins, who based it on the British &quot;three-score average&quot; system where the handicap was calculated as the average of the best three scores to par in the last year. The key difference was the introduction of a par rating (later known as course rating), which was based on the ability of leading amateur Jerome Travers, to account for variances in the playing difficulty of different courses. After initially allowing clubs to determine their own ratings, at the behest of Calkins the USGA quickly began assigning ratings centrally. Course ratings were rounded to the nearest whole number until 1967, when they started being given to one decimal place.

In 1947, the number of scores used to calculate handicaps was increased to the best 10 from all scores ever recorded subject to a minimum of 50. However this was not uniformly implemented, with regional associations disagreeing on the total number of rounds to be considered. In 1958, the USGA specified that the best 10 from 25 scores would be used. This was reduced to 10 from 20 in 1967, which remains to this day although a further adjustment was made with the introduction of a &quot;Bonus of Excellence&quot; multiplier to equalize handicaps and give better players a marginal advantage. Originally 85%, the multiplier was changed to 96% after being seen to favor better players too heavily. In 1974, Equitable Stroke Control was adopted in order to eliminate the effect of very high individual hole scores on handicap calculations.

With the system still not accounting for variances in playing difficulty for golfers of different abilities, in 1979 the USGA set to work on how to address the issue with the creation of the Handicap Research Team. The result of their work was the creation of what is now the Slope system. Slope was gradually introduced, firstly in Colorado in 1982, before being implemented nationally from 1987. The USGA then set about making further refinements to the course rating system, which at the time was still largely dependent on length, to take account of many other factors affecting scoring ability for a scratch golfer. The USGA Course and Slope Rating system is now used by most of the world&#x27;s major handicapping systems.

The USGA Handicap System is used throughout the jurisdiction of the USGA (i.e. the United States and Mexico), and is also licensed for use in many other countries around the world, e.g. Canada. The USGA has often resorted to the courts to protect the integrity of its handicap system. In one such case, the California Court of Appeal (First District) summarized the system&#x27;s history:

====USGA Handicap System overview====
A USGA handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that approximates how many strokes above or below par a player might be able to play, based on the ten best scores of their last twenty rounds. The calculation has several variables: the player&#x27;s scores from their most recent rounds, and the course and slope ratings from those rounds.

A handicap differential is calculated from each of the scores after Equitable Stroke Control (ESC), an adjustment which allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player&#x27;s course handicap, has been applied using the following formula:
:formula_11

The handicap differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the best 10 from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged, before being multiplied by 0.96 (the &quot;bonus of excellence&quot;) and truncated to one decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are calculated from a minimum of five scores using ESC adjustments based on the course handicap corresponding to a handicap index of 36.4 for men or 40.4 for women. If there are at least 5 but fewer than 20 qualifying scores available, the handicap index is calculated using a set number or differentials according to how many scores are available.

The basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result truncated to one decimal place:
:formula_13

The handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set of tees being used. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number.

:formula_14

Updates to a golfer&#x27;s handicap index are issued periodically, generally once or twice per month depending on the local state and regional golf associations.

===CONGU Unified Handicapping System===
Following a meeting of the four men&#x27;s golf unions of Great Britain and Ireland in York arranged by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1924, the British Golf Unions Joint Advisory Committee (later Council of National Golf Unions) was formed. The organization was tasked with creating a handicapping system that would be equitable to golfers of varying ability, and as a result the Standard Scratch Score and Handicapping Scheme was devised. The system was introduced in 1926, and used a &quot;scratch score&quot; system to rate courses, taking account that courses may play easier or more difficult than par.

A new system was introduced in 1983, which incorporated features of the Australian system. This was further revised in 1989 with the introduction of the &quot;Competition Scratch Score&quot; (CSS), an adjustment to the &quot;Standard Scratch Score&quot; (SSS), to take account of variances in course conditions (setup, weather, etc.) on a given day. Further significant changes came in 1993 (buffer zones) and 1997 (Stableford Points Adjustment). In 2002, the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) and the Ladies&#x27; Golf Union (LGU) began working together (the LGU had adopted a system similar to that of CONGU in 1998) and in February 2004 the Unified Handicapping System (UHS) came into force.

The Unified Handicapping System is used to manage handicaps for both men and women who are members of affiliated golf clubs in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The system is published by CONGU and administered by each of the individual unions on behalf of their members, with handicaps being managed locally by someone at each club; this person normally holds the position of competitions or handicap secretary.

====Unified Handicapping System overview====
Under the Unified Handicapping System, initial handicaps are allocated based on returned scores from 54 holes, usually three 18-hole rounds. The number of strokes taken on each hole is adjusted to maximum of double the par of the hole before adding up the scores; adjustments were previously 2 over par for men and 3 over par for women. The best of the &quot;adjusted gross differentials&quot; (AGD) between the adjusted score and the Standard Scratch Score (SSS) is taken to calculate the initial handicap using the following formula, with the result truncated to give a whole number:
:formula_15
Adjustments may be made to the initial handicap should it be deemed necessary to ensure it is reasonably fair. Handicaps are given to one decimal place and divided into categories with the lowest handicaps being in Category 1. Prior to 2018, the highest handicaps were in Category 4 for men, with a maximum of 28.0, and Category 5 for women, with a maximum of 36.0, with provision for higher &quot;club&quot; or &quot;disability&quot; handicaps up to a limit of 54.0 for those who cannot play to these lower limits. In 2018, handicap limits were standardized at 54.0 and a Category 5 was introduced for men, and a new Category 6 for all, replacing the club and disability category (see table below). The exact handicap is rounded to the nearest whole number to give the playing handicap. Many handicap competitions still have maximum limits of 28 for men and 36 for women.

For all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a players exact handicap based on the Competition Scratch Score (CSS). All hole scores are first adjusted to a maximum of net 2-over par with handicap strokes being used per the stroke index published on the scorecard; this is called Stableford or net double-bogey adjustment. Every stroke the adjusted net score is below the CSS triggers a reduction dependent on the players handicap category; for Category 1 this is 0.1 per stroke, for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should the adjusted net score exceed the CSS , there is a &quot;buffer zone&quot; equivalent to the handicap category before a 0.1 increase is applied, which is the same for all categories; for Category 1 there is 1 stroke buffer, for Category 2 it is 2 strokes, etc. The Competition Scratch Score is an adjustment to the Standard Scratch Score computed from all scores returned and is in the range formula_16 to formula_17 with provision for &quot;reduction only&quot; when scoring conditions have proved especially difficult.

In addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2 and above may also submit a number of &quot;supplementary scores&quot; in order to maintain their handicap; primarily a feature to accommodate golfers who play in few competitions and allow them to maintain current handicaps, it is also used by people who wish to try and get their handicap down while they are playing well. There are other mechanisms in the system to reduce or increase handicaps more quickly. Every year all handicaps are reviewed and adjusted if necessary to ensure they remain fair and accurate. In addition, any very good scores are monitored throughout the year and an &quot;exceptional scoring reduction&quot; may be applied if certain triggers are reached.

Historically calculating the CSS and any handicap adjustments was done manually by means of published tables, but this is now computerized with handicaps being published to a Centralised Database of Handicaps (CDH).

===EGA Handicap System===
The EGA Handicap System is the European Golf Association&#x27;s method of evaluating golf abilities so that players of different standards can compete in handicap events on equal terms. It is based on Stableford scoring and has some similarities to both the CONGU system, with regards to handicap categories and adjustments, and to the USGA system, with regards to the use of course and slope ratings and calculating playing handicaps. The first version of the system was introduced in 2000.

====EGA Handicap System overview====
Under the EGA Handicap System, initial handicaps require just a single 9 or 18-hole score recorded using the maximum handicap of 54. The handicap is then calculated from the number of Stableford points scored.

:formula_18

EGA handicaps are given to one decimal place and divided into categories, with the lowest handicaps being in Category 1 and the highest in Category 6 (see table below). The handicap is not used directly for playing purposes and a calculation must be done to determine a &quot;playing handicap&quot; specific to the course being played and set of tees being used. For handicaps in categories 1 to 5, the formula is as follows with the result rounded to the nearest whole number:

:formula_19

And for category 6 a &quot;playing handicap differential&quot; is used, which is equal to the playing handicap for a handicap index of 36.0:

:formula_20

For all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a players handicap index. All scores are first converted into Stableford points if necessary (i.e. rounds played using another scoring method, e.g. stroke play), effectively applying a net double bogey adjustment, and then for every point scored above the &quot;buffer zone&quot; there is a reduction applied to the players handicap index according to their handicap category; for Category 1 this is 0.1 per point, for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should the number of points scored be below the buffer zone, a fixed increase of 0.1 is applied to the handicap index regardless of category. The EGA system also takes account of variations in playing difficulty on any given competition day by means of a &quot;Computed Buffer Adjustment&quot; (CBA) which adjusts the buffer zones by between −1 and +2 with provision for &quot;reductions only&quot; when scoring is especially difficult. The CBA replaced the previous Competition Stableford Adjustment method, which adjusted player&#x27;s Stableford scores directly, in 2013.

In addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2 and above may also submit a number of &quot;extra day scores&quot; in order to maintain their handicap. Handicaps are also reviewed annually and any necessary adjustments made.

===Golf Australia Handicap System===
The Golf Australia Handicap System is maintained on GOLF Link, which was a world-first computerized handicapping system developed by Golf Australia&#x27;s predecessor, the Australian Golf Union (AGU) in the 1990s. When GOLF Link was first introduced it contained two key characteristics that set it apart from other world handicapping systems at the time:

#It used a Calculated Course Rating (CCR) to determine how difficult the course was on the day, and upon which handicap adjustment was made.
#It utilized a &#x27;swipe&#x27; card that enabled a player to access their handicap from any GOLF Link terminal in Australia.

In April 2010 GA adopted the USGA calculation method using the average of the best 10 differentials of the player&#x27;s past 20 total rounds, multiplied by 0.96. In September 2011 this was altered to the best 8 out of 20 rounds, multiplied by 0.93. The reasons for these changes were cited to restore equity between high and low handicaps. An ‘anchor&#x27; so that handicaps could not increase by more than 5 in a rolling 12-month period, slope ratings, and a more sophisticated version of CCR called the Daily Scratch Rating (DSR) were implemented on January 23, 2014.

====GA Handicap System overview====
The GA Handicap System is based on the Stableford scoring system, and uses slope and course rating (called &quot;Scratch Rating&quot;). For handicapping purposes, the scratch rating is adjusted to reflect scoring conditions (&quot;Daily Scratch Rating&quot;), and all scores are converted into Stableford points, called the Stableford Handicap Adjustment (SHA) and inherently applying net double bogey adjustments, regardless of the scoring system being used while playing.

Handicaps are calculated from the best 8 adjusted differentials, called &quot;sloped played to&quot; results, from the most recent 20 scores. Should there be 3 or more but fewer than 20 scores available, a specified number of &quot;sloped played to&quot; results are used, per the table below.

New handicaps require 3 18-hole scores to be submitted (or any combination of 9 and 18-hole scores totaling 54 holes played) using a &quot;Temporary Daily Handicap&quot; of 36 for men or 45 for women in order to calculate the necessary &quot;sloped played to&quot; results. &quot;Sloped played to&quot; results are calculated using the following formula and rounded to one decimal place:
:formula_21

To calculate the GA handicap, the &quot;sloped played to&quot; results are averaged and multiplied by a factor of 0.93, which is intended to equalize the handicap in favor of better players. The formula for calculating a GA handicap is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result truncated to one decimal place:
:formula_23

The GA handicap is used to create a &quot;daily handicap&quot;, specific to the course and set of tees being used, using the following formula with the result rounded to the nearest whole number:
:formula_24

===South African Handicap System===
Before 2018, the South African Handicap System used a proprietary course rating system without slope, called Standard Rating, which included specific calculations for length and altitude. Handicaps were calculated using the best 10 from the last 20 differentials, with differentials derived by means of a simple (Standard Rating − Adjusted Gross) formula. The system previously calculated handicaps against an adjusted Standard Rating (called Calculated Rating) but this was suspended in 2012. Playing handicaps were simply the exact handicap, rounded to the nearest whole number.

In September 2018, the renamed GolfRSA Handicap System adopted the USGA Course and Slope Rating system. This necessitated a few additional changes (e.g. playing handicap and differential calculations), but the system retained all other features (e.g. Adjusted Gross and no daily course rating adjustment). The playing handicap under the GolfRSA system includes the difference between the Course Rating and Par.

In October 2019, further changes were made which brought the GolfRSA Handicap System further into line with the upcoming World Handicap System. The changes introduced included reducing the number of differentials used in handicap calculations from 10 down to 8, net double bogey as the maximum score per hole, reducing the minimum number of valid 18-hole scores required for handicapping to three, and exceptional scoring reductions.

===Argentinian Handicap System===
The Argentine Golf Association (AAG) handicapping system is a relatively simple one, using only a course rating, without slope. New handicaps require the submission of scorecards from five 18-hole rounds (or ten 9-hole rounds). An initial handicap of 25 is normally used as a starting point, which is then adjusted based on the submitted scores. Handicaps are updated once every month, with current handicaps generated from a lookup table using the average of the best eight differentials from the last 16 rounds. Golfers simply use their exact handicap for playing purposes.

===Other systems===
For the handicapping of golfers who are ineligible for an official handicap, some system options are available:

====Peoria System====
The &quot;Peoria System&quot; was designed for the handicapping of all players competing in an event such as a &quot;charity&quot; or &quot;corporate&quot; golf day. Before play commences, the organisers secretly select 6 holes (in readiness for handicapping purposes later) from the course to be played. When players have completed their rounds, they apply the &quot;Peoria&quot; algorithm to their scores on the selected holes to determine their handicap for that round. They then subtract that handicap from their gross score to give their net score - and the winner is determined in the usual way.

====Callaway System====
The &quot;Callaway System&quot; was designed with the same objective as &quot;Peoria&quot;. The &quot;Callaway&quot; handicapping algorithm works by totaling a variable number of &quot;worst&quot; scores achieved (subject to a double-par limit) according to a simple table. A couple of adjustments are then made to this total to give the player&#x27;s handicap, which is then applied to their gross score as normal.

====Scheid System====
The &quot;Scheid System&quot; is similar to the Callaway System, except a different version of the table is used.

====System 36====
&quot;System 36&quot; is a same-day handicapping system similar in function to &quot;Callaway System&quot; and &quot;Peoria System&quot;. Throughout the round, the golfer accrues points based on the following formula:

* Double bogey or worse: 0 points
* Bogey: 1 point
* Par or better: 2 points

At the end of the round, points earned are tallied. The total is subtracted from 36, and the resulting number is the golfer&#x27;s handicap allowance. The golfer&#x27;s net score can then be computed using their System 36 handicap allowance.

<text>Fish oil is oil derived from the tissues of oily fish. Fish oils contain the omega−3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), precursors of certain eicosanoids that are known to reduce inflammation in the body and improve hypertriglyceridemia. There has been a great deal of controversy in the 21st century about the role of fish oil in cardiovascular disease, with recent meta-analyses reaching different conclusions about its potential impact.

The fish used as sources do not actually produce omega−3 fatty acids. Instead, the fish accumulate the acids by consuming either microalgae or prey fish that have accumulated omega−3 fatty acids. Fatty predatory fish like sharks, swordfish, tilefish, and albacore tuna may be high in omega−3 fatty acids, but due to their position at the top of the food chain, these species may also accumulate toxic substances through biomagnification. For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends limiting consumption (especially for women of childbearing age) of certain (predatory) fish species (e.g., albacore tuna, shark, king mackerel, tilefish and swordfish) due to high levels of the toxic contaminant mercury. Dioxins, like PCBs and chlordane, as well as other chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides are also present. Fish oil is used in aquaculture feed, in particular for feeding farmed salmon.

Marine and freshwater fish oil vary in contents of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA. The various species range from lean to fatty, and their oil content in the tissues has been shown to vary from 0.7% to 15.5%. They also differ in their effects on organ lipids. Studies have revealed that there is no relation between either 1) total fish intake or 2) estimated omega−3 fatty acid intake from all fish and serum omega−3 fatty acid concentrations. Only fatty fish intake, particularly salmonid, and estimated EPA + DHA intake from fatty fish has been observed to be significantly associated with increase in serum EPA + DHA.

 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four fish oil-based prescription drugs, namely Lovaza, Omtryg (both omega-3-acid ethyl esters), Vascepa (ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid), and Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids). None of these drugs are actually fish oil; they are all derivatives of acids found in fish oil.

== Uses ==
Often marketed and sold for consumption as part of the diet or in dietary supplements in contemporary societies, fish oils also have found roles in external use, as emollients
or as general ointments
as well as in body art,
or for alleged insulation against cold temperatures.

Fishmeal and fish oil are the principal sources of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in animal diets.

== Food sources ==
The most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much omega−3 oils as omega−6 oils. Other oily fish, such as tuna, also contain omega−3 in somewhat lesser amounts. Although fish is a dietary source of omega−3 oils, fish do not synthesize them; they obtain them from the algae (microalgae in particular) or plankton in their diets.

EPA and DHA are available as dietary supplements most commonly as fish oil capsules, softgels, and gummies,1 krill oil, and less commonly as algae oil.2 Generally, salmon oil has more DHA than EPA while other fish oils such as herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and pollock have more EPA than DHA. (See Supplements section below.)

For comparison, note the omega−3 levels in some common non-fish foods:

== Health effects==
===History===
Fish oil became one of the earliest dietary supplements, and by the end of the 19th century, was used as a treatment for many diseases, including such ailments as tuberculosis and hysteria. The possible effects of fish oil and omega−3 fatty acids have since been studied in clinical depression, anxiety, cancer, and macular degeneration, yet they have not been proven effective.

=== Various recommendations ===
In a 2009 letter on a pending revision to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the American Heart Association recommended 250–500 mg/day of EPA and DHA. The Guidelines were revised again for 2015–2020; included is a recommendation that adults consume at least eight ounces of a variety of types of fish per week, equating to at least 250 mg/day of EPA + DHA. The Food and Drug Administration recommends not exceeding 3 grams per day of EPA + DHA from all sources, with no more than 2 grams per day from dietary supplements.

=== Prostate cancer ===
The effect of fish oil consumption on prostate cancer is controversial. For instance, one study showed decreased risk with higher blood levels of DPA. However, another reported increased risk of more aggressive prostate cancer with higher blood levels of combined EPA and DHA. Some evidence indicated an association between high blood levels of omega−3 fatty acids and an increased prostate cancer risk.

However, this evidence from the Select Trial has been challenged on the grounds of methodology and that the quantitative difference between those who developed prostate cancer and those who did not &quot;is so small as to be biologically irrelevant&quot;.

=== Cardiovascular ===
There is uncertainty about the role of fish oil in cardiovascular disease, with reviews reaching different conclusions about its potential impact. Multiple evaluations suggest fish oil has little or no reduction on cardiovascular mortality, although there may be a small reduction in the incidence of actual cardiac events and strokes with its use. In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended the consumption of 1 gram of fish oil daily, preferably by eating fish, for patients with coronary artery disease, but cautioned pregnant and nursing women to avoid eating fish with high potential for mercury contaminants including mackerel, shark, and swordfish. (Optimal dosage was related to body weight.)

The US National Institutes of Health lists three conditions for which fish oil and other omega−3 sources are most highly recommended: hypertriglyceridemia (high triglyceride level), preventing secondary cardiovascular disease, and hypertension (high blood pressure). It then lists 27 other conditions for which there is less evidence. It also lists possible safety concerns: &quot;Intake of 3 grams per day or greater of omega-3 fatty acids may increase the risk of bleeding, although there is little evidence of significant bleeding risk at lower doses. Very large intakes of fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids may increase the risk of hemorrhagic (bleeding) stroke.&quot;

There were studies to determine if fish oil had an effect on certain abnormal heart rhythms, although a 2012 meta-analysis found no significant effect.

A 2008 meta-study found fish oil supplementation did not demonstrate any preventative benefit to cardiac patients with ventricular arrhythmias. A 2012 meta-analysis covering 20 studies and 68,680 patients, found that omega−3 fatty acid supplementation did not reduce the chance of death, cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke. A 2018 meta-analysis of 77,000 participants found a 3% reduction in the relative risk for those who supplemented fish oil; however, this effect was deemed insignificant.

=== Hypertension ===
There have been some human trials that have concluded that consuming omega−3 fatty acids slightly reduces blood pressure (DHA could be more effective than EPA). Because omega−3 fatty acids can increase the risk of bleeding, a qualified healthcare provider should be consulted before supplementing with fish oil.

=== Mental health ===
A 2008 Cochrane systematic review found that limited data is available. In the one eligible study, omega−3s were an effective adjunctive therapy for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. The authors found an &quot;acute need&quot; for more randomised controlled trials.

A 2009 metastudy found that patients taking omega−3 supplements with a higher EPA:DHA ratio experienced fewer depressive symptoms. The studies provided evidence that EPA may be more efficacious than DHA in treating depression. However, this metastudy concluded that due to the identified limitations of the included studies, larger, randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

In a 2011 meta-analysis of PubMed articles about fish oil and depression from 1965 to 2010, researchers found that &quot;nearly all of the treatment efficacy observed in the published literature may be attributable to publication bias.&quot;

A 2014 meta-analysis of eleven trials conducted respectively on patients with a DSM-defined diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and of eight trials with patients with depressive symptomatology but no diagnosis of MDD demonstrated significant clinical benefit of omega−3 PUFA treatment compared to placebo. The study concluded that: &quot;The use of omega-3 PUFA is effective in patients with diagnosis of MDD and on depressive patients without diagnosis of MDD.&quot;

====Antidepressant====
A 2019 meta-analysis concluded that EPA ≥ 60% at a dosage of ≤1 g/d may have antidepressant effect.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
A Cochrane meta-analysis published in June 2012 found no significant protective effect for cognitive decline for those aged 60 and over and who started taking fatty acids after this age. A co-author of the study said to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Our analysis suggests that there is currently no evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplements provide a benefit for memory or concentration in later life&quot;.

=== Psoriasis ===
Diets supplemented with cod liver oil have shown beneficial
effects on psoriasis.

=== Pregnancy ===
Some studies reported better psychomotor development at 30 months of age in infants whose mothers received fish oil supplements for the first four months of lactation. In addition, five-year-old children whose mothers received modest algae based docosahexaenoic acid supplementation for the first 4 months of breastfeeding performed better on a test of sustained attention. This suggests that docosahexaenoic acid intake during early infancy confers long-term benefits on specific aspects of neurodevelopment.

In addition, provision of fish oil during pregnancy may reduce an infant&#x27;s sensitization to common food allergens and reduce the prevalence and severity of certain skin diseases in the first year of life. This effect may persist until adolescence with a reduction in prevalence and/or severity of eczema, hay fever and asthma.

=== Crohn&#x27;s disease ===
A 2014 Cochrane review found that, based on two large studies, fish oil supplements did not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn&#x27;s disease.

== Supplements ==

Fish oil is a commonly used dietary supplement, with sales in the US alone reaching $976 million in 2009. By 2020 the global omega−3 supplement market size had reached $5.58 billion, and fish oil based supplements accounted for 63.1% of that market.

===Formulation===
Fish oil supplements are available mainly as liquids or capsules. Most of these capsules are single-piece gel capsules or softgels. Also available are enteric-coated capsules that pass through the stomach before dissolving in the small intestine, thus helping prevent indigestion and &quot;fish burps&quot;. Poorly manufactured enteric-coated products have the potential to release ingredients too early. ConsumerLab.com, a for-profit supplement testing company, reported that 1 of the 24 enteric-coated fish oil supplements it evaluated released ingredients prematurely. Fish oil products may use other techniques to hide the fishy taste. For example, added lemon or strawberry flavor tends to produce a more agreeable product and are usually present in fish oil gummies.

===EPA and DHA content===
Generally, oily fish have more EPA than DHA versus salmon which has more DHA than EPA. To illustrate the amounts of EPA and DHA in supplements, a softgel capsule containing fish oil derived from pollock might contain a total of 642 mg of total fish oil, of which 584 mg are omega−3 fatty acids, with 377 mg EPA and 158 mg DHA.3 That same company&#x27;s salmon oil softgel contains 1008 mg of total fish oil, of which 295 mg are omega−3 fatty acids, with 95 mg EPA and 118 mg DHA.4

According to ConsumerLab.com tests, the concentrations of EPA and DHA in supplements can vary from between 8 and 80% fish oil content. The concentration depends on the source of the omega−3s, how the oil is processed, and the amounts of other ingredients included in the supplement. However, the bioavailability of EPA and DHA from both capsular and emulsified fish oils has been shown to be high. A ConsumerLab.com publication in 2010 stated that 3 of 24 fish oil supplements tested contained less EPA and/or DHA than was claimed on the label. A 2012 report stated that 4 of 35 fish oil supplements that were tested contained less EPA or DHA than was claimed on the label, and 3 of 35 contained more.

===Quality and concerns===
Problems of quality have been identified in periodic tests by independent researchers of marketed supplements containing fish oil and other marine oils. These problems may include contamination, inaccurate listing of EPA and DHA levels, spoilage, and formulation issues.

====Contamination====
A report by the Harvard Medical School studied five popular brands of fish oil, including Nordic Ultimate, Kirkland and CVS. They found that the brands had &quot;negligible amounts of mercury, suggesting either that mercury is removed during the manufacturing of purified fish oil or that the fish sources used in these commercial preparations are relatively mercury-free&quot;. 
There appears to be little risk of contamination by microorganisms, proteins, lysophospholipids, cholesterol, and trans-fats.

====Dioxins and PCBs====
Dioxins and PCBs may be carcinogenic at low levels of exposure over time. These substances are identified and measured in one of two categories, dioxin-like PCBs and total PCBs. While the US FDA has not set a limit for PCBs in supplements, the Global Organization for EPA and DHA (GOED) has established a guideline allowing for no more than 3 picograms of dioxin-like PCBs per gram of fish oil. In 2012, samples from 35 fish oil supplements were tested for PCBs. Trace amounts of PCBs were found in all samples, and two samples exceeded the GOED&#x27;s limit. Although trace amounts of PCBs contribute to overall PCB exposure, Consumerlab.com claims the amounts reported by tests it ordered on fish oil supplements are far below those found in a single typical serving of fish.

====Spoilage====
Peroxides can be produced when fish oil spoils. A study commissioned by the government of Norway concluded there would be some health concern related to the regular consumption of oxidized (rancid) fish/marine oils, particularly in regards to the gastrointestinal tract, but there is not enough data to determine the risk. The amount of spoilage and contamination in a supplement depends on the raw materials and processes of extraction, refining, concentration, encapsulation, storage and transportation. ConsumerLab.com reports in its review that it found spoilage in test reports it ordered on some fish oil supplement products.

===Prescription fish oil-based medications===
Fish oil itself is available as a prescription, but the majority of fish oil products available via prescription are derivatives of fish oil. Such products are described elsewhere in this article. These preparations, with the purpose of treating or preventing medical disorder, are only available with a doctor&#x27;s prescription. In the US, such prescriptions undergo the same Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory requirements as other prescription medications, including with regard to both efficacy and safety. Purity is also regulated by the FDA. The prescription fish oil derivative medicines differ from over-the-counter fish oil supplements. Prescription fish oil is considered a safe and effective option to reduce triglycerides. There are various prescription fish oil products that have been approved and permitted by the FDA for decreasing triglyceride levels. Prescription fish oil products having DHA work by raising LDL-C levels to reduce triglycerides, like fibrates. Heart experts advise that prescription fish oil helps in decreasing additional levels of blood fats. Prescription fish oils might only help when triglycerides reach a specific upper level. Prescription fish oil pills, capsules and tablets have more omega−3 fatty acids than those which are non-prescription. The FDA regularly monitors prescription fish oil for standards like purity and for quality and safety.

As of 2019, four fish oil-based prescription drugs have been approved in the United States for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, namely:
#Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids) was approved on 23 April 2014. Clinical trial on mixed dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridemia with hypocholesterolemia) started in 2014 found that it has no medical benefits, and the clinical trial was called off on 13 January 2019. Although FDA-approved, Epanova is not available in any market.
#Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) was approved on 10 November 2004.
#Omtryg (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) was approved on 23 April 2014.
#Vascepa (ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid; icosapent ethyl) was approved on 26 July 2012. On 13 December 2019, the FDA also approved it as the first drug specifically &quot;to reduce cardiovascular risk among patients with elevated triglyceride levels.&quot; Vascepa is not approved as a monotherapy for lowering TGs: it must be taken with a statin, per product labeling.

Some fish-oil products are approved for parenteral nutrition:
#Omegaven, approved in July 2018, is indicated as a source of calories and fatty acids in children with parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC).
#Smoflipid, approved in July 2016, is indicated in adults as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.

== Dangers ==
A 2013 review concluded that the potential for adverse events among older adults taking fish oil &quot;appear mild–moderate at worst and are unlikely to be of clinical significance&quot;.

=== Maximum intake ===
The FDA recommends that consumers do not exceed more than 3 grams per day of EPA and DHA combined, with no more than 2 grams from a dietary supplement. This is not the same as 3000 mg of fish oil. A 1000 mg pill typically has only 300 mg of omega−3; 10 such pills would equal 3000 mg of omega−3. 
According to the European Food Safety Authority&#x27;s (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies, supplementation of 5 grams of EPA and DHA combined does not pose a safety concern for adults. A 1987 study found that healthy Greenlandic Inuit had an average intake of 5.7 grams of omega−3 EPA per day which had many effects including prolonged bleeding times, such as slower blood clotting.

====Research====
Two 2021 systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that more than 1 g/d marine omega−3 fatty acids is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

=== Vitamins ===
The liver and liver products (such as cod liver oil) of fish and many animals (such as seals and whales) contain omega−3, but also the active form of vitamin A. At high levels, this form of the vitamin can be dangerous (Hypervitaminosis A).

=== Toxic pollutants ===
Consumers of oily fish should be aware of the potential presence of heavy metals and fat-soluble pollutants like PCBs and dioxins, which are known to accumulate up the food chain. After extensive review, researchers from Harvard&#x27;s School of Public Health in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (2006) reported that the benefits of fish intake generally far outweigh the potential risks.

Fish oil supplements came under scrutiny in 2006, when the Food Standards Agency in the UK and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland reported polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels that exceeded the European Union maximum limits in several fish oil brands,
which required temporary withdrawal of these brands. To address the concern over contaminated fish oil supplements, the International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) Program, a third-party testing and accreditation program for fish oil products, was created by Nutrasource Diagnostics Inc. in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.

A March 2010 lawsuit filed by a California environmental group claimed that eight brands of fish oil supplements contained excessive levels of PCBs, including CVS/pharmacy, Nature Made, Rite Aid, GNC, Solgar, Twinlab, Now Health, Omega Protein and Pharmavite. The majority of these products were either cod liver or shark liver oils. Those participating in the lawsuit claim that because the liver is the major filtering and detoxifying organ, PCB content may be higher in liver-based oils than in fish oil produced from the processing of whole fish.

An analysis based on data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) with regards to the dangers of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in cod liver came to the conclusion that &quot;in Norwegian women, fish liver consumption was not associated with an increased cancer risk in breast, uterus, or colon. In contrast, a decreased risk for total cancer was found.&quot;

Microalgae oil is a vegetarian alternative to fish oil. Supplements produced from microalgae oil provide a balance of omega−3 fatty acids similar to fish oil, with a lower risk of pollutant exposure.

== Notes ==
# Omega−3 fish oil supplements have no standard doses and vary considerably by producers and producers&#x27; products, but salmon oil consistently has more DHA than EPA while other fish oils have more EPA than DHA. For example, one supplier, Trident Food&#x27;s Pure Alaska salmon oil product label reports per serving DHA 220 mg and EPA 180 mg (total omega−3 = 600 mg), but their fish oil based on pollock has DHA 144 mg and EPA 356 mg (total omega−3 = 530 mg). Equivalent products from another producer, Fish Oils, Puritan&#x27;s Pride, reports DHA 180 mg and EPA 150 mg for their salmon oil product (total omega−3 = 420 mg), but DHA 204 mg and EPA 318 mg for fish oil derived from anchovy, sardine, and mackerel (total omega−3 = 600 mg). For information and comparison purposes only, no endorsements are implied. 
# Plant-based omega−3s are rich in ALA but completely lack EPA and DHA, so vegetarians and vegans seeking non-fish sources turn to more expensive algae derived oils. There is generally a pattern of more DHA than EPA in most of these products. For example, Nordic Naturals reports per serving DHA 390 mg and EPA 195 mg (total omega−3 = 715 mg), Calgee reports DHA 300 mg and EPA 150 mg (total omega−3 = 550 mg) and so on, but iwi Life reports DHA 100 mg and EPA 150 mg (total omega−3 = 252 mg). For information and comparison purposes only, no endorsements are implied.

<text>Arago is a lunar impact crater located in the western part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after French astronomer François Arago in 1935. Its diameter is 26 km. To the southwest lies the crater Manners, and beyond are Dionysius and the Ritter–Sabine crater pair. To the southeast is the large Lamont formation that has been submerged by the mare.

The rim of Arago has a bulge in the western wall. There is a central ridge that runs towards the northern wall. The surface of the mare nearby is marked by wrinkle ridges, most notably to the east and southeast. To the north is a large lunar dome designated Arago Alpha (α). A similar-sized lunar dome is located an equal distance to the west, designated Arago Beta (β).

Arago is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Arago.

<doc id="999327" wikidata="Q495977" url="?curid=999327" title="James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose">
<text>James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose, KT, PC (16 July 1799 – 30 December 1874), styled Marquess of Graham until 1836, of Buchanan Castle, Stirlingshire and 45 Belgrave Square, London, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
Montrose was the son of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, by his second wife Lady Caroline Maria, daughter of George Montagu, 4th Duke of Manchester. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.

===Cricket===
A member of Marylebone Cricket Club, Montrose made a single first-class appearance for an All-England team against Hampshire in 1828. He was recorded in the scorecard as Lord James Graham and scored two runs.

==Political career==
In 1821, aged 21, Montrose was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, despite not having a seat in Parliament, and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He remained as Vice-Chamberlain until 1827. He was returned to Parliament for Cambridge in 1825, a seat he held until 1832, and served as a commissioner of the India Board between 1828 and 1830. In 1836 he succeeded his father in the dukedom and entered the House of Lords.

When the Earl of Derby became Prime Minister in February 1852, Montrose was appointed Lord Steward of the Household, a post he retained until the government fell in December of the same year. He again served under Derby as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1858 and 1859 and under Derby and later Benjamin Disraeli as Postmaster General between 1866 and 1868, although he was never a member of the Cabinet. As Postmaster General he introduced the Electric Telegraphs Bill which resulted in the transfer of British telegraph companies to the Post Office.

Apart from his political career Montrose served as Chancellor of the University of Glasgow between 1837 and 1874 (succeeding his father) and as Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire between 1843 and 1874. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1845.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1836, Montrose married Hon. Caroline Agnes Horsley-Beresford (1818–1894), daughter of John Beresford, 2nd Baron Decies and grand-niece of the 1st Marquess of Waterford. In 1860, they were both survivors of the train involved in the Atherstone rail accident. She survived him and in 1876 married secondly to William Stuart Stirling-Crawfurd. By his wife he had issue including:

===Sons===
* Lord James John Graham (1845–1846), who died in infancy.
* Lord James Graham (1847–1872), styled by the courtesy title of Marquess of Graham, eldest surviving son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father by two years.
* Douglas Beresford Malise Ronald Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose (1852–1925), only surviving son and heir, who married Violet Hermione Graham, second daughter of Sir Frederick Ulric Graham, 3rd Baronet.

===Daughters===
* Lady Agnes Caroline Graham (1839–1873), who married Lt. Col. John Murray of Touchadam and Polmaise in 1859.
* Lady Beatrice Violet Graham (1842–1932), was a writer (she married Algernon Greville, 2nd Baron Greville in 1863).
* Lady Alma Imogen Leonora Carlotta Graham (1854–1932), who married Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane in 1872.

==Death==
He died at Cannes in December 1874, aged 75, and was succeeded in the dukedom by his son, Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose (1852–1925).

<doc id="999330" wikidata="Q654344" url="?curid=999330" title="Ariadaeus (crater)">
<text>Ariadaeus is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater on the western shores of Mare Tranquillitatis. It lies to the north of the crater Dionysius, and to the west-southwest of Arago. The crater is joined along the northeast rim by the slightly smaller Ariadaeus A, and the two form a double-crater. Its diameter is 10.4 km.
This crater marks the eastern extent of the rille designated Rima Ariadaeus. This wide rille extends in a nearly straight line to the west-northwest, passing just to the north of the crater Silberschlag. Other rille systems lie in the vicinity, including the Rimae Ritter to the southeast and Rimae Sosigenes to the northeast.

The crater was named after Philip III of Macedon (Arrhidaeus).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ariadaeus.

<doc id="999332" wikidata="Q2082722" url="?curid=999332" title="Martin Mystery">
<text>Martin Mystery (French: Martin Mystère) is an animated television series based on the Italian comic book &quot;Martin Mystère&quot; by Alfredo Castelli. The show was produced by Marathon Animation (French television production company based in Neuilly-sur-Seine), and Image Entertainment Corporation (a Canadian production and animation company based in Montreal). Like with the case of its sister show Totally Spies!, it uses an art style similar to Japanese anime. The series premiered on YTV on 1 October 2003 in its originating country of Canada.

==Premise==
The series re-imagines the comic books&#x27; main characters Martin Mystery and Diana Lombard as teenage stepsiblings attending Torrington Academy, a boarding school located in the city of Sherbrooke, Quebec. They work for a secret organization known as &quot;The Center,&quot; which covertly protects the people of Earth from extraterrestrial and supernatural threats and investigates the unknown and the paranormal. Their allies at The Center include Billy, a small, green-skinned alien who is one of Martin&#x27;s best friends; and Java, a caveman from 200,000 years ago, who works as a janitor at Torrington Academy and is the arm of the group.

Martin&#x27;s vast knowledge of the supernatural and his remarkable intuition make him a valued agent of The Center, and compensate for his huge ego and his clumsy attitude. Diana resents these flaws at times, as Martin often does not seem to understand the seriousness of his missions, but generally respects him, and loves him and his way of being himself without compromises.

==Episodes==
==Characters==
;Martin Mystery
:Martin is a 16-year-old Canadian boy, with a passion for monsters and the paranormal, who works as a paranormal investigator for The Center. He is immature, hyperactive, and zany, constantly bursting with energy. He is usually an underachiever in school, once getting 106 out of 902 on his pre-college aptitude test. While impulsive and impatient – often leaping into danger on missions without thinking to help those in peril – he consistently proves to be a quick thinker and clever. He has a peculiar love for everything slimy, sloppy, and gooey – things that make Diana gag. His favorite pastime is taunting Diana badly by playing practical jokes. A running gag in the series is his constant flirting with every beautiful girl he meets, who usually reject him.
:Martin jumps to conclusions very often, coming up with every unlikely theory he can think of, usually from some horror movie or monster movie he saw, or from his subscription to &quot;Paranormal Monthly&quot;. As the leader of the trio, Martin is also the only one who wears a U-Watch. His first monster was Venoso, a female chameleon monster that has the power to shape-shift into any person it wants.
:Martin appears in a crossover episode of &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;. During the episode, he is immediately smitten with Clover, even though she is uninterested in him. Towards the end of the same episode, Clover finally showed interests in Martin and even tries to get his attention, but Martin and Alex have hit it off due to a shared love of comics and video games. Throughout the episode, Martin continuously describes Sam as a &quot;really lame buzz-kill&quot;, but does not lash out at him due to her composed demeanor.

;Diana Lombard
:Diana is Martin&#x27;s stepsister, who is his complete opposite. She is also 16 years old and an agent for The Center, while attending Torrington Academy. She is a rigid overachiever, and often has a hard time keeping her cool with Martin. The stepsiblings argue frequently, with such arguments ending in some sort of bet that Diana usually loses. Diana can be timid at times – which leads to Martin calling her a &quot;wimp&quot; – but can show great courage when called upon. Her intelligence often comes in handy on their missions. Never sharing Martin&#x27;s love of the paranormal, she often tries to reason with logic instead of jumping to conclusions.
:Diana is often used as &quot;bait&quot; for the majority of their missions, which results in her being a victim of the monster. Such examples include: being cocooned by an acid-spewing insect queen, turned into a frog by a warlock Martin unleashed, and being possessed by a vengeful spirit at a mountain lodge. When Martin is incapacitated by other monsters, she uses her own skills to save him, and even wears Martin&#x27;s U-watch in a few episodes.

;Java the Caveman
:Java is a 200,000-year-old caveman, who assists Martin and Diana in their investigations as the team&#x27;s tracker. Friends with both, he often works odd jobs at Torrington. While he does not usually contribute much to conversation due to his simplistic English (e.g. &quot;What that?&quot;, &quot;Diana bald&quot;, and &quot;Java no like this place&quot;), his brute strength and creative thinking often help in the team&#x27;s investigations.
:Java is a significant source of comedy in the show, due to his reactions to various scenarios and his poor hygiene as a caveman (e.g. his offensive foot odor, putrid armpits, and filthy breath). His technophobia also provides some running gags. His backstory was revealed in the episode &quot;Return of the Beasts&quot;. Java was created by an evil ex-paleontologist who sought revenge. Java was apprehended by the Center, quickly befriended Martin and Diana, and helped them stop the paleontologist and his mutant dinosaurs and Java has been a part of the team ever since.

;M.O.M.
:The director of The Center. M.O.M. oversees the investigation of paranormal activities throughout the world. Serious, uncompromising, and an expert at hand-to-hand combat, she is often seen multitasking. While Martin&#x27;s capabilities make him one of her favorite agents, she is often annoyed by his childish behavior. A running gag in the series is Martin destroying nearly every piece of gadgetry she is working on whenever he appears for a debriefing in her office.
:As an agent, the first creature she captured was Gastromo, a parasitic, iron-eating, slug-like monster who infects and controls those he touches. Contrary to the dry sense of humor she provides to the series, Billy has said she is &quot;a real party animal when she gets going&quot;. In one episode, Martin and Diana discover she turns The Center into a nightclub afterhours for agents, and they see her dancing. And despite her rather serious and stoic nature, she is always in a happy and festive mood at Christmas, to which a disbelieving Martin comments that it looks like &quot;M.O.M. is actually having fun&quot;.
:In the crossover episode of &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;, M.O.M. is shown to have a possibly romantic history with the spies&#x27; boss Jerry, much to the spies&#x27; and Martin&#x27;s displeasure, as she and Jerry spy-flirt between holograms. The initials M.O.M. are said to actually stand for &quot;Mystery Organization Manager&quot;, as explained by Martin in that episode. While her real name is unknown, she used the alias Ms. Olivia Mandell (derived from the initials M.O.M.) in the episode &quot;Web of the Spider Creature&quot;.

;Billy
:Billy is M.O.M.&#x27;s personal secretary; he is a tiny green alien often seen flying on his mini hovercraft. Friendly and upbeat, he usually greets the gang when they are first signed in, and often does his signature high five with Martin (whom he idolizes). His role is generally a supportive one; he often pops in to give the team valuable information, usually startling them in the process. He will also analyse samples or photographs that Martin sends in during a mission. However, he will not help on a mission directly unless he is forced to.
:In the second season, it was revealed Billy was once the great alien warrior Ganthar on another planet, who led other aliens to conquer planets and strip them of their resources, but he gave up violence for good after realizing what he did was wrong. On his home planet, he was a supermodel, likely popular since he was fearsome and powerful. Billy arrived on Earth in the Roswell Incident in 1947. In later episodes (season 3 onward), Billy adopted a human disguise — the &quot;B.S. 1000&quot; — to be with Martin and Diana at their school. There are a few later episodes that hint Billy has romantic feelings for Diana, much to Martin&#x27;s disgust.

===Recurring===
;Jenni Anderson
:Diana&#x27;s best friend. Jenni is one of the prettiest and most popular girls attending Torrington. She has blue eyes and flared auburn-coloured hair, usually seen wearing a black blouse and skirt with knee-high boots. Martin is in love with her, which she does not return due to his immaturity. She regularly describes him as &quot;immature&quot;, a &quot;freak&quot;, and a &quot;loser&quot;. However, there are times she becomes interested in him, particularly when Martin acts like a gentleman. Unfortunately for Martin, this never lasts due to her memory being erased, or Martin subsequently doing something stupid.

;Marvin
:Martin&#x27;s rival. The son of a pilot, Marvin enjoys the extreme, saying that he enjoys the adrenaline rush that comes with such activities. Some of his activities includes rock climbing in the Himalayas, parasailing over the Great Barrier Reef, street-luging on the German Autobahn, jungle kayaking, and snowboarding down the face of K2. His talents and popularity make everyone at the school fawn over him, while making Martin jealous.
:In &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, Marvin is recruited to work for The Center, which annoys Martin. At the end of &quot;Body-Swappers&quot;, he is relocated to Hawaii as a reward for his work on the mission. However, in &quot;Rage of the Leprechaun&quot;, he is relegated to The Center&#x27;s South Pole facility because of his negligence in a previous mission, and blames his unfortunate circumstances on Martin.

;Gerard Mystery
:Martin&#x27;s father, and Diana&#x27;s stepfather. The complete opposite of his son, Gerard is a very rational, logical person. As a scientist, he spends much of his time doing field work in the forest. He and Martin have a strained relationship, partly due to Gerard considering Martin&#x27;s interest in the paranormal to be &quot;balderdash&quot;. He only appeared in three episodes; in his second appearance, he finds out about The Center and that Diana and Martin work for it. Diana&#x27;s mother, Martin&#x27;s stepmother, is only mentioned once in season three.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Martin Mystery&quot; aired in Canada on YTV and Discovery Kids in English, and on Vrak in French, from 2003 until the series finale in 2006.

In the United States, the first 7 episodes were originally shown on FoxBox in May and June 2004. Nickelodeon later picked up the series, and after a brief run on the main channel, the series aired on Nicktoons Network from 4 July 2005 until 27 April 2008.

===In other markets===
Other channels that aired the show included M6 in France, Rai 2 in Italy, and Jetix throughout Europe (excluding Italy and Poland). Additional channels in Europe included SVT1 and SVT Barnkanalen in Sweden, NRK Super in Norway, Yle TV2 in Finland, GMA Network and Q (now known as GTV) in the Philippines, VT4 in Belgium and ZigZap in Poland. In Sri Lanka, the series was aired by Channel Eye of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.

MBC 3, Ajyal TV, and ART 3 broadcast this show in Arabic throughout the Middle East, with the voice talents of Mo&#x27;awad Ismail as Martin and Mariam El Khesht as Diana.

===Home media===
Home video of &quot;Martin Mystery&quot; was distributed in France by &quot;PolyGram&quot; and &quot;MK2&quot;. In Italy, home video was distributed by 01 Distribution. Home video for the English version of season 1 was also released in Canada and the United States, but has become a rarity in recent years.

==Crossovers with other series==
Background characters resembling Martin, Diana, and Marvin have appeared on other series produced by Marathon and Image, such as &quot;Team Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Totally Spies!,&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spiez!&quot;.

In 2007, a year after the series ended, the characters of Martin and M.O.M appeared on a fifth season episode of &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;. In the episode &quot;Totally Mystery Much?&quot;, Martin helps the team investigate a series of Yeti sightings in Antarctica. None of the other &quot;Martin Mystery&quot; characters appeared in the episode, except for M.O.M, although Diana was mentioned.

==Future==
The series ended production after its third season, with 66 episodes being aired.

In December 2013, a possible &quot;new season project&quot; was announced on the official Martin Mystery Facebook page. As of 2025, there has been no further announcement or plans for such. However, there have been talks about a potential digital remaster and re-release of the series in 16:9 widescreen.

On October 10, 2023, it was announced a new animated series is currently in the works. No further announcement for such has been made since.

==Reception==
Common Sense Media wrote of the series, &quot;&quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; meets &quot;X-Files&quot;; tweens OK.&quot;

<text>The Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico (, PNPR) is a Puerto Rican political party founded on September 17, 1922, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Its primary goal is to work for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. The Party&#x27;s selection in 1930 of Pedro Albizu Campos as its president brought a radical change to the organization and its tactics.

In the 1930s, intimidation, repression and persecution of Party members by the government, then headed by a U.S. president-appointed governor, led to the assassination of two government officials, the attempted assassination of a federal judge in Puerto Rico, and the Rio Piedras and Ponce massacres. Under the leadership of Albizu Campos, the party abandoned the electoral process in favor of direct armed conflict as means to gain independence from the United States.

By the late 1940s, a more US-friendly party, the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD), had gained an overwhelming number of seats in the legislature and, in 1948, it passed &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law), which attempted to suppress the Nationalist Party and similar opposition. The Puerto Rican police arrested many Nationalist Party members under this law, some of whom were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. With a new political status pending for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth, Albizu Campos ordered armed uprisings in several Puerto Rican towns to occur on October 30, 1950. In a related effort, two Nationalists also attempted to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman on November 1, 1950, in an effort to call international attention to issues related to Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status, but the attempt failed. The last major armed event by the Nationalists occurred in 1954 at the US House of Representatives when four party members shot and wounded five Congressmen.

After Albizu Campos&#x27;s death in 1965, the party dissolved into factions and members joined other parties, but some continue to follow the party&#x27;s ideals in one form or another, often informally or ad hoc, to this day.

==Historical context==
After four hundred years of colonial domination under the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico finally received its sovereignty in 1898 through a &quot;Carta de Autonomía&quot; (Charter of Autonomy). This Charter of Autonomy was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes. Despite this, just a few months later, the United States claimed ownership of the island as part of the Treaty of Paris which concluded the Spanish–American War.

Opponents to the colonial government argued that the profits generated by this arrangement were one-sided, enormous for the United States. [google.com]

When the war ended, U.S. President McKinley appointed Charles Herbert Allen as the first civilian governor of Puerto Rico. Though Allen had a business background, his financial administration of Puerto Rico was strikingly unsound. He ignored the appropriation requests of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates, refused to make any municipal, agricultural or small business loans, built roads at double the costs of preceding administrations, and left 85% of the school-age population without schools. Rather than making these requested infrastructure and education investments, Allen&#x27;s budget raided the Puerto Rican treasury. His administration re-directed tax revenues to no-bid contracts for U.S. businessmen, railroad subsidies for U.S.-owned sugar plantations, and high salaries for U.S. bureaucrats in the island government.

Allen&#x27;s financial acumen improved considerably when he returned to the U.S., and resumed his own personal business interests. In 1901, Allen resigned as governor and installed himself as president of the largest sugar-refining company in the world, the American Sugar Refining Company. This company was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. In effect, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.

In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously for independence from the United States. In 1917, the US Congress passed an act by which it granted citizenship to Puerto Rican residents. This was overwhelmingly opposed by the island&#x27;s political leaders. Critics said the US was simply interested in increasing the size of its conscription pool to get soldiers for World War I.

==United States &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;==
By 1930, over 40 percent of all the arable land in Puerto Rico had been converted into sugar plantations, which were entirely owned by Domino Sugar Company and U.S. banking interests. These bank syndicates also owned the entire coastal railroad, and the San Juan international seaport.

This was not limited to Puerto Rico. By 1930 the United Fruit Company owned over one million acres of land in Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico and Cuba. By 1940, in Honduras alone, the United Fruit Company owned 50 percent of all private land in the entire country. In Guatemala, the United Fruit Company owned 75 percent of all private land by 1942 – plus most of Guatemala&#x27;s roads, power stations and phone lines, the only Pacific seaport, and every mile of railroad.

The U.S. government supported all these economic exploits, and provided military &quot;persuasion&quot; whenever necessary.

==Founding of the Nationalist Party==

The origins of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party date to 1917, when a group of Union Party members in Ponce, dissatisfied with the attitude of the Union Party of Puerto Rico towards the &quot;granting&quot; of U.S. citizenship, formed the &quot;Asociación Nacionalista de Ponce&quot; (Ponce Nationalist Association). Among its founders were Guillermo Salazar, Rafael Matos Bernier, J. A. González, and Julio César Fernández. These men also founded the newspaper &quot;El Nacionalista&quot;.

The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was formed as a direct response to the American colonial government. In 1919, José Coll y Cuchí, a member of the Union Party of Puerto Rico, felt that the Union Party was not doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. Coll y Cuchí and some followers left to form the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. Under Coll y Cuchí&#x27;s presidency, the party convinced the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an Act that would permit the transfer of the remains of the Puerto Rican patriot, Ramón Emeterio Betances, from Paris, France, to Puerto Rico. 

The Legislative Assembly appointed Alfonso Lastra Charriez as its emissary since he had French heritage and spoke the language fluently. Betances&#x27; remains arrived in San Juan on August 5, 1920. A funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Association transferred the remains from San Juan to the town of Cabo Rojo, where his ashes were interred by his monument.

By the 1920s, two other pro-independence organizations had formed on the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by José S. Alegría, Eugenio Font Suárez and Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. On September 17, 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuchi was elected president and José S. Alegría (father of Ricardo Alegría) vice-president.
In 1924, Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president. Alegría was named Nationalist Party president in 1928 and held that position until 1930. By 1930, disagreements between Coll y Cuchi and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run, led the former and his followers to leave and return to the Union Party. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered to be Coll y Cuchí&#x27;s attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy. On May 11, 1930, Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party maintained that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty of Paris following the Spanish–American War could not have empowered the Spanish to &quot;give&quot; to the US what was no longer theirs. Under Albizu Campos&#x27;s leadership during the years of the Great Depression, the party became the largest independence movement in Puerto Rico.

In the mid-1930s, there were disappointing electoral results and strong repression by the territorial police authorities. The party staged some protests that developed into celebrated incidents because of police overreaction: The October 1935 Rio Piedras and the Ponce massacres. In these, government forces fired on unarmed civilians. After the Río Piedras massacre, in December 1935, Albizu Campos announced that the Nationalist Party would withdraw from electoral participation while the United States kept control. Albizu Campos began to advocate direct, violent revolution.

==Nationalist Party during 1930–1950==
Nationalist Party partisans were involved in a variety of dramatic and violent confrontations between 1930 and 1950:

*In the 1930s, the party founded the official youth organization &quot;Cadetes de la República&quot;, headed by Raimundo Díaz Pacheco, and the &quot;Hijas de la Libertad&quot; (Daughters of Freedom), the women&#x27;s branch of the &quot;Cadetes&quot; and in which Julia de Burgos served as secretary general.
*On April 6, 1932, Nationalist partisans marched into the Capitol building in San Juan to protest a legislative proposal to establish the current Puerto Rican flag as the official flag of the insular government. Nationalists preferred the flag used during the Grito de Lares. A melée ensued in the building, and one partisan fell to his death from a second floor interior balcony. The protest was condemned by the legislators Rafael Martínez Nadal and Santiago Iglesias; and endorsed by others, including the future leader of the statehood party, Manuel García Méndez.

*On October 24, 1935, a confrontation with police at University of Puerto Rico campus in Río Piedras resulted in the deaths of 4 Nationalist partisans and one policeman. The event is known as the Río Piedras massacre. This and other events led the party to announce on December 12, 1935, a boycott of all elections held while Puerto Rico remained part of the United States.
*On February 23, 1936, in San Juan, two Nationalists assassinated the Insular Police Chief and ex-U.S. Marine officer, E. Francis Riggs. The Nationalist perpetrators, Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp, were arrested, transported to police headquarters, and killed within hours without trial. No policeman was ever tried or indicted for their deaths. 
*On March 21, 1937, the Nationalist Party organized a peaceful march in the southern city of Ponce. At the last moment, the permit was withdrawn, and the Insular Police (a force &quot;somewhat resembling the National Guard of the typical U.S. state&quot; and which answered to the U.S.-appointed governor Blanton Winship) were arrayed against the marchers. They opened fire upon what a U.S. Congressman and others reported were unarmed and defenseless Cadets and bystanders alike, killing 19 and badly wounding over 200 more.

:Many of these unarmed people were shot in the back while trying to run away – including a 7-year old girl, who died as a result. An ACLU report declared it a massacre and it has since been known as the Ponce massacre. The march had been organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the incarceration by the U.S. government of nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Soon thereafter, the Puerto Rican government arrested the leadership of the Nationalist party, including Pedro Albizu Campos. In two trials, they were convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States.

:A government investigation into the incident drew few conclusions. A second, independent investigation ordered by the US Commission for Civil Rights (May 5, 1937) led by Arthur Garfield Hays (a member of the ACLU) with Fulgencio Piñero, Emilio Belaval, Jose Davila Rice, Antonio Ayuyo Valdivieso, Manuel Diaz Garcia, and Franscisco M. Zeno, concluded that the events on March 21constituted a massacre. The report harshly criticized the repressive tactics and massive civil rights violations by the administration of Governor Blanton Winship.

*On July 25, 1938, the municipality of Ponce organized celebrations to commemorate the American landing in 1898. This included a military parade and speeches by Governor Blanton Winship, Senate president Rafael Martínez Nadal, and others. When Winship rose to speak, shots were fired at him, slaying police Colonel Luis Irizarry, who was seated next to the governor. The Nationalist Interim President M. Medina Ramírez repudiated the shooting and denied any involvement in it, but numerous Nationalists were arrested and convicted of participating in the shooting. Winship worked to repress the Nationalists. Jaime Benitez, a student at the University of Chicago at the time, wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which in part read as follows:

Soon afterward, two Nationalist partisans, among them Raimundo Díaz Pacheco, attempted to assassinate Robert Cooper, judge of the Federal Court in Puerto Rico. On May 12, 1939, Winship was summarily removed from his post as Governor by President Roosevelt.

*On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948.

:Officially known as Law 53 (&quot;Ley 53&quot;) of 1948, the Gag Law made it illegal to display the Puerto Rican flag, sing patriotic songs, talk about independence, or fight for the liberation of the island, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of US$10,000 (), or both.
*Albizu Campos ordered Nationalist uprisings to take place on October 30, 1950 (they had originally been planned for 1952, when Commonwealth status was expected.) These involved a dozen or so skirmishes throughout the island.

==Nationalist Revolts of 1950==


The first battle of the Nationalist uprisings occurred in the early hours of October 29, in &quot;barrio&quot; Macaná of Peñuelas. The police surrounded the house of the mother of Melitón Muñiz, the president of the Peñuelas Nationalist Party, that he was using as a distribution center for weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired on the Nationalists and a firefight ensued, resulting in the death of two Nationalists and wounding of six police officers.

In the Jayuya Uprising, led by Nationalist leader Blanca Canales, a police station and post office were burned. The town was held by the Nationalists for three days.

The Utuado Uprising culminated in the Utuado Massacre by the local police, in which five Nationalists were executed.

The San Juan Nationalist revolt was a Nationalist attempt to enter the Governor&#x27;s mansion, &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;, in order to attack then-governor Luis Muñoz Marín. The hour-long shootout resulted in the death of four Nationalists: Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Manuel Torres Medina and Raimundo Díaz Pacheco. Three guards were also seriously wounded.

Various other shootouts took place throughout island – including those at Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, and Ponce, where Antonio Alicea, Jose Miguel Alicea, Francisco Campos (Albizu Campos&#x27;s nephew), Osvaldo Perez Martinez and Ramon Pedrosa Rivera were arrested and accused of the murder of police corporal Aurelio Miranda during the revolt. Raul de Jesus was accused of violating the Insular Firearms Law.

On October 31, police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded &quot;Salón Boricua,&quot; a barbershop in Santurce. Believing that a group of Nationalists were inside the shop, they opened fire. The only person in the shop was Campos barber Vidal Santiago Díaz. Santiago Díaz, who fought alone against the attackers for three hours, received five wounds, including one in the head. The battle was transmitted &quot;live&quot; via the radio airwaves to the public in general.

On November 1, 1950, Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who was staying at the Blair House in Washington, D.C.

Truman supported development of a constitution for Puerto Rico and the 1952 status referendum on it; 82% of the voters approved the constitution. The US Congress also approved the constitution.

On March 1, 1954, Lolita Lebrón together with fellow Nationalists Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andrés Figueroa Cordero attacked the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. The group opened fire with automatic pistols. Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers. One of the congressmen, Representative Alvin Bentley from Michigan, was seriously wounded. On her arrest, Lebrón yelled &quot;I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!&quot;

On November 18, 1955, a non-violent splinter group of nationalists calling themselves &quot;La Quinta Columna&quot; (The 5th Column) broke away from the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party due to not supporting the ideas and thoughts of Albizu Campos, as to a Puerto Rico relationship with Spain as its Mother country and their nationalistic love for Puerto Rico as their Motherland. The other reason for the splinter group was due to the violence that took place in the 1950s. This splinter group would later become known in 1968 as &quot;El Movimiento Indio Taino de Boriken&quot; (The Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico) which was primarily made up of the children of the Puerto Rican Nationalists whom would come to establish the indigenous grassroots civil rights movement in Puerto Rico.

==1960s–present==
Although less active, the Nationalist Party continues to exist as an organization and an ideology. It also has somewhat of a &quot;chapter&quot; in New York City. The New York Junta is an autonomous organ of the party that recognizes, and is recognized by, the National Junta in Puerto Rico.

In 2006 and in representation of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Jose Castillo spoke before the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization and said that the Nationalist Party &quot;had appeared in the past to denounce colonialism in Puerto Rico and hoped the Special Committee would show its commitment to the island&#x27;s struggle for self-determination, so that it could join the United Nations in its own right ... The Special Committee and its resolutions on Puerto Rico were indispensable instruments.&quot; Castillo &quot;called upon the United States Government to assure the Puerto Rican people of their right to self-determination and human rights and immediately cease the persecution, arrests, and murders perpetrated against independence fighters. Vieques peace activists must be freed immediately, and the FBI&#x27;s electronic surveillance and continued harassment of independence fighters must be stopped. The United States must also end its actions against basic human rights while fully implementing the United Nations resolution calling for a constituent assembly to begin decolonization.&quot; Castillo added that &quot;Puerto Rico had its own national identity ... Since its 1898 invasion, the United States had tried to destroy the nationality of Puerto Rican people. It kept Puerto Rico in isolation, maintaining it as private corporation from which it earned billions a year ... exploitation had made foreigners richer and the Puerto Rican people poorer. The fact that Puerto Rico was the last territory in the world could not be hidden. Violation of rights there would cease only once it was a free and independent nation. The United States must provide compensation for what it had done to Puerto Rico&#x27;s land and people.&quot;

In 2013 the Puerto Rico Nationalist Party made a public demonstration of their pro-Independence commitment by protesting a speech from the Governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla.

Its last president was Antonio &quot;Toñito&quot; Cruz Colón until his death in October 2014.

<text>Aristillus is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern Mare Imbrium. It was named after Greek astronomer Aristyllus. Directly to the south is the smaller crater Autolycus, while to the southwest is the large Archimedes. To the northeast are the craters Theaetetus and Cassini.

The rim of Aristillus has a wide, irregular outer of ejecta that is relatively easy to discern against the smooth surface of the surrounding mare. The crater impact created a ray system that extends for a distance of over 600 kilometers. Due to its rays, Aristillus is mapped as part of the Copernican System. The rim is generally circular in form, but possesses a slight hexagonal shape. The inner walls of the rim have a surface, and descend to a relatively rough interior that has not been flooded with lava. In the middle of the crater is a set of three clustered peaks, which rise to a height of about 0.9 km.

In the northern outer s of Aristillus is a ghost crater remnant. This is the protruding rim of an old crater that has been almost completely submerged by the lava flows of the surrounding Mare Imbrium. The southern end of the rim has been covered by the ejecta from Aristillus. Along the eastern inner wall and rim is an unusual narrow ribbon of dark material.
English progressive rock band Camel named the first song on their album &quot;Moonmadness&quot; after the crater. Science fiction author Travis J I Corcoran set much of his first novel, &quot;The Powers of the Earth&quot;, on and under Aristillus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Aristillus.

<doc id="999351" wikidata="Q4699003" url="?curid=999351" title="Airsickness">
<text>Airsickness is a specific form of motion sickness which is induced by air travel and is considered a normal response in healthy individuals. Airsickness occurs when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from the body (including the inner ear, eyes and muscles) affecting balance and equilibrium.
Whereas commercial airline passengers may simply feel poorly, the effect of airsickness on military aircrew may lead to a decrement in performance and adversely affect the mission.

The inner ear is particularly important in the maintenance of balance and equilibrium because it contains sensors for both angular (rotational) and linear motion. Airsickness is usually a combination of spatial disorientation, nausea and vomiting.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms of airsickness include:

Nausea, vomiting, vertigo, loss of appetite, cold sweating, skin pallor, difficulty concentrating, confusion, drowsiness, headache, and increased fatigue.
Severe airsickness may cause a person to become completely incapacitated.

==Risk factors==
The following factors increase some people&#x27;s susceptibility to airsickness:
* Fatigue, stress and anxiety are some factors that can increase susceptibility to motion sickness of any type.
* The use of alcohol, drugs, and medications may also contribute to airsickness.
* Additionally, airsickness is more common in women (especially during menstruation or pregnancy), young children, and individuals prone to other types of motion sickness.
* Although airsickness is uncommon among experienced pilots, it does occur with some frequency in student pilots.

==Prevention==

Travelers who are susceptible to motion sickness can minimize symptoms by:
* Choosing a window seat with a view of the Earth&#x27;s surface or of lower clouds, such that motion can be detected and visually observed.
* Choosing seats with the smoothest ride in regards to pitch (the seats over the wings in an airplane). This may not be sufficient for sensitive individuals who need to see ground movement.
* Sitting facing forward while focusing on distant objects rather than trying to read or look at something inside the airplane.

==Treatment==

===Medication===
Medications that may alleviate the symptoms of airsickness include:
* meclizine
* dimenhydrinate
* diphenhydramine
* scopolamine (available in both patch and oral form).

Pilots who are susceptible to airsickness are usually advised not to take anti-motion sickness medications (prescription or over-the-counter). These medications can make one drowsy or affect brain functions in other ways.

===Non-medication based===
A method to increase pilot resistance to airsickness consists of repetitive exposure to the flying conditions that initially resulted in airsickness. In other words, repeated exposure to the flight environment decreases an individual&#x27;s susceptibility to subsequent airsickness.
The US Air Force and US Navy have an Air Sickness Management Program and use a device called a Barany chair to desensitize trainees over 3 days. This combined with progressive relaxation (diaphragmatic breathing and muscle tensing) yields a high success rate.
The Italian Air Force also uses a similar spinning chair and psychologic relaxation techniques which yields an 82% long-term success rate, over a 10-day training period.

Several devices have been introduced that are intended to reduce motion sickness through stimulation of various body parts (usually the wrist).

===Alternative medicine===
Alternative treatments include ginger and acupuncture, with variable effectiveness.

<text>Atlas is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon, to the southeast of Mare Frigoris. Just to the west is the slightly smaller but still prominent crater Hercules. Northeast of Atlas is the large crater Endymion.

The inner wall of Atlas is multiply and the edge slumped, forming a sharp-edged lip. This is a floor-fractured crater with a rough and hilly interior that has a lighter albedo than the surroundings. Floor-fractures are usually created as a result of volcanic modifications.

There are two dark patches along the inner edge of the walls; one along the north edge and another besides the southeast edges. A system of slender clefts named the Rimae Atlas crosses the crater floor, and were created by volcanism. Along the north and northeastern inner sides are a handful of dark-halo craters, most likely due to eruptions. Around the midpoint is a cluster of low central hills arranged in a circular formation.

Atlas is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

The name Atlas was formally recognized by the IAU in 1935.

Its southwest quadrangle is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Atlas.

==Exploration==
The Atlas crater was the primary landing site of the Hakuto-R Mission 1 by ispace, that launched on December 11, 2022. separating from the rocket 47 minutes later at a distance around away from Earth. If it had been successful, this mission would have been the first private landing on the lunar surface, and would have been the first Japanese probe to land on the Moon.

Communication with Hakuto-R Mission 1 was lost during the final moments of descent to the lunar surface at 16:40 UTC (00:40 JST) on 25 April 2023. The iSpace team confirmed that the $90 million dollar spacecraft had most likely crashed during its landing on the Moon. Analysis determined that the lander plummeted uncontrollably when the propellant was exhausted. This happened because the onboard computer wrongly assumed the radar altimeter was faulty, and ignoring its data, misjudged the actual altitude of the spacecraft and kept hovering 5 kilometers above the surface of the Moon.

<text>.ao is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Angola. It was originally administered by the college of engineering of the University of Agostinho Neto before being redelegated to the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technologies.

==History==

===New Registry (DNS.AO)===

On 17 June 2019, commercial registration of domains was relaunched, with a single registrar approved for issuance, the government-run Serviços Públicos Electrónicos do Governo de Angola. Registration cost was reduced to 8000 Kwanzas per year. By January 2020, 2500 new registrations were received, six times more than in the previous five years. Registrations from outside Angola are not yet permitted.

===Original Registry (Reg.AO)===

As of January 2019, the old registry&#x27;s website had not been modified since December 2001, and consisted of a single page in Portuguese. One of the few links on the page was to a document in Microsoft Word format, in English, which gave registration rules for the domain; they stated that registration by entities outside Angola was to be done only in the .it.ao subdomain. The search engine Google seems to be the first .it.ao entity using the subdomain. It also said that registrations were only taken at the third level. Registration cost was US$300.

<doc id="999371" wikidata="Q787075" url="?curid=999371" title="Autolycus (crater)">
<text>Autolycus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southeast part of Mare Imbrium. The crater is named after the ancient Greek astronomer Autolycus of Pitane. West of the formation is Archimedes, a formation more than double the size of Autolycus. Just to the north is Aristillus, and the outer ramparts of these two craters overlap in the intermediate stretch of the lunar mare.

==Description==
The rim of Autolycus is somewhat irregular, although generally circular overall. It has a small outer rampart and an irregular interior with no central peak. It possesses a light ray system that extends for a distance of over 400 kilometers. Due to its rays, Autolycus is mapped as part of the Copernican System. Some of the ray material appears to overlay the flooded floor of Archimedes, and thus Autolycus is older than Archimedes. Aristillus (to the north), however, has rays that overlay both Autolycus and Archimedes, and thus it is the youngest of the three craters.

The first man-made impact upon the Moon was when the Luna 2 probe crash-landed just to the west-southwest of the crater rim on September 13, 1959, according to the claim of one Hungarian astronomer who claimed to see an explosion of dust.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Autolycus.

<text>.ar is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Argentina, administered by NIC Argentina. 

== Registration ==
Registering an .ar domain (like website.ar) directly is allowed as of 2020.

Previously, only 9 of the second-level domains listed below were open for registration, and a local presence in Argentina was required. 

As of August 2024, some new augmented reality companies are using domains directly under the .ar TLD.

==Second-level domains==
As of January 2017 there are currently 12 second-level domains.
==Special characters==
In November 2008, a resolution approved the use of special characters in domain names, including ñ, ç, á, é, í ó, ú, ä, ë, ï, ö, and ü. 

The .gob.ar domain was also approved for government entities (.gob stands for &quot;gobierno&quot;, government in Spanish).

<text>Abenezra is a lunar impact crater located in the rugged highlands in the south-central section of the Moon. Abenezra is named after the Sephardic Jewish sage, poet, biblical commentator, and astronomer Abraham ibn Ezra. It is attached along the southeast rim to the crater Azophi. To the northeast lies the crater Geber, and further to the southeast is the larger Sacrobosco.

The rim of Abenezra has a noticeably polygonal shape, with uneven wall segments. The inner walls are , and the floor is irregular and ridged. These ridges form unusual, sinuous patterns across the floor. The crater overlays the eastern part of another crater-like formation designated Abenezra C.

<text>Paul Michael Slayton (born March 11, 1981), better known by his stage name Paul Wall, is an American rapper and DJ. He has spent much of his career affiliated with Swishahouse, and has released several albums under the label and collaborated with numerous other rappers signed to the label. He began his career performing alongside fellow Houstonian Chamillionaire, with whom he released several albums, including 2002&#x27;s independently released &quot;Get Ya Mind Correct&quot;. By 2005, he was signed to Atlantic Records and became successful with his major label debut &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;, which was followed up by &quot;Get Money, Stay True&quot; released in 2007. He has been nominated for one Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance as a Duo or Group for the song &quot;Grillz&quot;, his collaboration with rapper Nelly.

== Career ==
=== Swishahouse (1998–2005) ===
Wall attended Jersey Village High School and studied mass communications at the University of Houston for three years. Wall&#x27;s first music exposure came as a street team member on the Northwest side of Houston, promoting southern labels like Cash Money and No Limit Records.

After proposing to do promotions for Michael &quot;5000&quot; Watts&#x27; company Swishahouse, Chamillionaire and Paul Wall came to 97.9 the Box (KBXX), Watts&#x27; radio station. Paul and Chamillionaire convinced Watts to let them rap on his radio show and put the verses on one of his mixtapes. That mixtape was titled &quot;Choppin Em Up Part 2&quot;, which was released in mid-1999. The freestyle became so popular locally that Chamillionaire and Paul Wall became regular staples on Houston&#x27;s mixtape circuit, appeared on several of Watts&#x27; mixtapes and became permanent members of Swishahouse.

After fellow member Slim Thug left the label, Chamillionaire and Paul Wall followed suit and the two started their own group known as The Color Changin&#x27; Click (named after Chamillionaire&#x27;s chameleon persona). Each successive mixtape released by The Color Changin&#x27; Click led to more business opportunities; the most notable of which was a contract to do a full album for Paid in Full Records. A one-album contract was negotiated between the Color Changin&#x27; Click and Paid in Full&#x27;s label head, DJ Madd Hatta from 97.9 The Box, and the CCC&#x27;s first album, &quot;Get Ya Mind Correct&quot;, would go on to sell over 200,000 copies.

Wall is also an accomplished and proficient mixtape and party DJ, known for producing mixtapes in the now well-known chopped and screwed style, which was invented by DJ Screw.

In 2004, Wall returned to Swishahouse and appeared on Mike Jones&#x27; first commercially distributed single, &quot;Still Tippin&#x27;&quot;.

=== Solo success (2005–2007) ===

In 2005, Paul Wall released his first album, &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single was &quot;Sittin&#x27; Sidewayz&quot; featuring Big Pokey, which peaked at no. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Chart and no. 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single, &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, featured Bun B of UGK, and the video version also featured Mike Jones. The third single, &quot;Girl&quot;, became the most successful single off &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;, peaking at no. 35 on the Hot 100.

In November 2005, Paul Wall was featured on Nelly&#x27;s Grillz, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2007, Wall released his second album &quot;Get Money, Stay True&quot;, which debuted in the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album spawned the singles &quot;Break &#x27;Em Off&quot; featuring Lil Keke, and &quot;I&#x27;m Throwed&quot; featuring and produced by Jermaine Dupri. &quot;Break &#x27;Em Off&quot; peaked at no. 72 on the Hot 100 and no. 58 on the R&amp;B charts, and &quot;I&#x27;m Throwed&quot; peaked at no. 87 on the Hot 100 and no. 47 on R&amp;B.

Paul Wall was a member of the rap group Expensive Taste, with his friends Travis Barker and Skinhead Rob (Transplants).

In 2007, Paul Wall appeared alongside other celebrities in the music video for &quot;Rockstar&quot; by Nickelback. He appeared on reggae artist Collie Buddz&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

=== Other projects and newer releases (Since 2008) ===

In the spring of 2008, Paul Wall joined Strange Music recording artist Tech N9ne on a nationwide tour, which featured rapper Ill Bill.

Paul Wall appears as fictional rapper Grillionaire in the movie &quot;I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell&quot;, released on September 25, 2009. He, along with screenwriters Nils Parker and Tucker Max, co-wrote tracks for the movie.

In 2010, Paul Wall featured on the album &quot;Przyjaźń, Duma, Godność&quot;, (English: &quot;Friendship, Pride, Dignity&quot;) by Polish rap artist Kaczor. He also collaborated with Limp Bizkit on the song &quot;Middle Finger&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. 

In October 2011, Paul Wall collaborated with Silicon Valley–based social and mobile game company Jump Shot Media to create the world&#x27;s first mobile battle rap game, &quot;Battle Rap Stars&quot;. Paul is featured as the &quot;main event&quot; and is the rapper to beat in order to win the game. On March 7, 2012, Paul Wall released a mixtape entitled &quot;No Sleep Til Houston&quot;. Paul Wall released a collaboration mixtape with Slim Thug for the 2013 NBA All-Star Game in Houston.

On December 10, 2013, Paul Wall released his seventh studio album, an 11-track offering, titled &quot;CheckSeason&quot;, which featured contributions from Stunna Bam, Killa Kyleon, Slim Thug, Lil Keke, Kid Ink and Young Dolph. The record was released independently via his Paul Wall Music imprint.

Paul Wall followed up &quot;Check Season&quot; on December 2, 2014, with the release of his eighth studio album, titled &quot;The Po-Up Poet&quot; which was produced by June &quot;The Jenius&quot; James. According to a &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine article in November 2014, &quot;The almost circus-like production reestablishes the idea that as long as Wall&#x27;s been in the game, he&#x27;s been a beloved Texas rap legend&quot;.

On September 25, 2015, Paul Wall followed up &quot;The Po-Up Poet&quot; with his ninth studio album, titled &quot;SlabGod&quot; which contains the single &quot;Swangin&#x27; In The Rain&quot;. On March 11, 2016, Wall released a remix of &quot;Swangin&#x27; In The Rain&quot; which features Slim Thug, Lil&#x27; Keke, J-Dawg, Z-Ro, and Chamillionaire. On October 21, 2016, he followed up &quot;SlabGod&quot; with his ninth album, titled &quot;Houston Oiler&quot;, released in October 2016. In February 2017, he released the mixtape &quot;Diamond Boyz&quot; with rapper C Stone. His tenth album &quot;Bounce Back Over Setbacks&quot; was released on January 19, 2018. His eleventh album, &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; followed in March 2020. On June 5, 2020, Wall released a mixtape with Lil Keke, titled &quot;Slab Talk&quot;.

== Acting career ==
During his break from rapping, Paul Wall appeared in &quot;Furnace&quot; with Ja Rule. He appeared in the 2009 film &quot;I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell&quot; along with Jesse Bradford and Matt Czuchry. He was in the 2010 science fiction film &quot;Xtinction: Predator X&quot;. In 2014 he starred in Isaac Yowman&#x27;s independently released theatrical film &quot;The Holy Spoof&quot; which sold out in all of its theater showings before its digital stream release online.

== Musical style and image ==
AllMusic critic Andy Kellman described Wall&#x27;s rapping style as having a &quot;thick but swift Southern drawl&quot; whose lyrics had &quot;countless local slang terms (slabs, swangas, candy paint, tippin&#x27;) that necessitate a glossary for many listeners.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Wall is married and has two children. In 2010, he went on an extreme diet and had gastric sleeve surgery, resulting in an over 100 lb. weight loss.

During the 2008 United States presidential election, Wall supported Democratic candidate Barack Obama. 
He is a devoted fan of the Houston Texans, Houston Rockets, and the Houston Astros.

== Controversy ==
=== Chamillionaire ===
On November 19, 2004, Wall and his entourage allegedly attacked Chamillionaire&#x27;s younger brother, Rasaq Seriki, at a nightclub. Chamillionaire expressed his disappointment in Paul Wall, arguing that they all used to be family and that these events should not have happened. Before the entire incident between Paul Wall and Rasaq they were all part of the group called &quot;The Color Changin&#x27; Click&quot; which now has become fragmented. Chamillionaire released a diss track with Rasaq titled &quot;Go Head&quot;.

The dispute ended in 2010, when the pair reunited for a full tour. Wall stated &quot;It took a long time and us growing. You know, we started off as a group and a lot of times when you go your separates ways, a lot of people say, &quot;Oh you can&#x27;t do it without him&quot; and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could make it on my own.&quot; Chamillionaire replied; &quot;We had been bumping into each other a lot. It&#x27;s kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It&#x27;s not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing a long time ago, but nobody believed us.&quot;

<text>Westcott is a neighborhood in Syracuse, New York, United States. Its proximity to Syracuse University makes for a diverse community, home to Syracuse University students, professors and other faculty and staff, as well as residents at all income levels. Westcott Street is the main retail street of the neighborhood, featuring numerous restaurants, coffee shops, stores and The Westcott Theater performing arts venue. It is the site of the annual Westcott Street Cultural Fair, a one-day event with food, art, live performances and cultural activities. Westcott is also home to Thornden Park, one of the largest parks in Syracuse. The Westcott neighborhood is the boyhood home of renowned banjoist Tony Trischka.

==History==

Westcott was founded in the late nineteenth century as a result of the growth of Syracuse University. In 1893, the neighborhood began being served by electric streetcars, which ran on a loop along Walnut Avenue, Euclid Avenue, Westcott Street, and East Genesee Street towards downtown Syracuse. The current Westcott business district formed on the streetcar line.

The Blanchard House, Thornden Park, and Babcock-Shattuck House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Popular establishments ==
Westcott Street is home to numerous restaurants, coffee shops, and stores that reflect the neighborhood&#x27;s diversity and bohemian culture. &quot;Alto Cinco&quot;, opened in 1995 as a takeout only restaurant, is a Tex-Mex eatery is located in the heart of Westcott street, right next to The Westcott Theater. Recess Coffee, opened in 2007, is located adjacent to Westcott Street. The brand has expanded to other regions of Syracuse, and they currently partner with over 60 different local cafes, restaurants and grocery stores to sell their self-titled brand of coffee.

<text>The Invaders is the name of two fictional superhero teams appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
The original team was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Sal Buscema in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #71 (December 1969).

A present-day incarnation was introduced by writer Chuck Austen and artist Scott Kolins in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (vol. 3) #82 (July 2004).

==Fictional team history==
The prototype for the Invaders, the All-Winners Squad, created by publisher Martin Goodman and scripter Bill Finger, was a comic book feature published in the Golden Age with only two appearances, in &quot;All Winners Comics&quot; #19 (Fall 1946) and #21 (Winter 1947; there was no issue #20). 

This team had much of the same membership as the Invaders, but had its adventures in the post–World War II era, the time that their adventures were published. 

This group was also notable as its members did not entirely get along, prefiguring the internal conflicts of the Fantastic Four in the 1960s.

===World War II===
The Invaders team first appeared in flashback stories set during World War II, and comprised existing characters from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel. Originally, Captain America (Steve Rogers), his sidekick Bucky (James Barnes), the original android Human Torch (&quot;Jim Hammond&quot;), the Torch&#x27;s sidekick Toro (Thomas Raymond) and Namor the Sub-Mariner were together as heroes opposing the forces of Nazism. When these superheroes saved the life of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Master Man, the thankful Churchill suggested that they should become a team, known as the Invaders.

The Invaders fight the Axis powers over the world until eventually finding themselves in England, where they meet Lord James Montgomery Falsworth, the original Union Jack. He joins the team and provides them with a base of operations in England. Eventually, Falsworth&#x27;s children Brian (Union Jack II) and Jacqueline (Spitfire) become members. The team later adds Miss America (Madeline Joyce) and super-speedster the Whizzer (Bob Frank), during a battle with the Super-Axis. Later, against the threat of the Battle-Axis, the team is assisted by the Blazing Skull and the Silver Scorpion.

The team continues to fight against several threats, (including a Nazi occupation of Atlantis and the emergence of HYDRA backed by the time-travelling Baron Strucker) and faces an emotional trauma with the apparent deaths of Captain America and Bucky in a drone aircraft&#x27;s explosion near the end of World War II, as first described in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #4 (March 1964). After the war&#x27;s end, several members—including the second Bucky and Captain America (respectively, Fred Davis and William Naslund, formerly the superhero known as the Spirit of &#x27;76)—created a new team, the All-Winners Squad. When that team dissolves, Marvel retroactively changes the continuity (&quot;retcon&quot;) of several members, having them join Citizen V&#x27;s V-Battalion.

After the Invaders&#x27; introduction in the pages of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, the team appeared in its own try-out title, &quot;Giant-Size Invaders&quot; #1 in 1975, followed by the ongoing series; &quot;The Invaders&quot; later that year, and a single &quot;Annual&quot; in 1977. Issues #5–6 of the series introduced another retroactively changed World War II team, the Liberty Legion, in a two-part story arc, &quot;The Red Skull Strikes&quot;, interlaced with another two-part story in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #29–30.

===New Invaders===

In 2004, a new Invaders team was created in the four-issue story arc &quot;Once an Invader...&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Avengers&quot; (vol. 3) #82, written by Chuck Austen. The revived team was spun off into its own title, &quot;The New Invaders&quot;, running 10 issues (August 2004 – June 2005) beginning with issue #0. It was written by Allan Jacobsen with artwork by C. P. Smith.

The new team consisted of the Blazing Skull (Mark Todd), a flame-generating girl named Tara, former Liberty Legion member the Thin Man (Dr. Bruce Dickson), the U.S. Agent (John Walker, a.k.a. Captain America V), Union Jack III (Joey Chapman) and returning members Namor and Spitfire. Later, the ageless android the Human Torch I joins the team, feeling an affinity for Tara, revealed as an android herself. The Invaders are also assisted by former Golden Age hero the Fin and his Atlantean wife Nia, although they did not officially join the team.

They are formed by the supposed U.S. Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk—in actuality the Red Skull—who coerces the Thin Man into gathering this new team, which the Skull intends to use for his own goals. The new Invaders eventually learn of the plan, however, and thwart it. The apparent &quot;death&quot; of the android Human Torch came as a result of the betrayal of the Skull-planted Tara. The majority of the members quit the team after this incident.

===&quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot;===

The 2007 12-issue crossover series &quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot; saw the original WWII team of Captain America I, Bucky I, Namor, the Human Torch I, and Toro (leaving Spitfire and a wounded Union Jack II in the past) brought to the present-day Marvel Universe by the Cosmic Cube, which had fallen into the hands of the demon D&#x27;Spayre. His use of it to draw on the grief generated by Captain America&#x27;s death had unintentionally caused it to grant the wish of those who wished for his return. 

Upon arriving in the present day, the Invaders battled the Thunderbolts and The Mighty Avengers, believing them to be Nazi agents. Eventually, the Invaders came to trust the Avengers teams (both Mighty and New versions) and agreed to go back to where they belonged. The teams collected the Cosmic Cube and an American soldier who traveled into the future with the Invaders. However, the soldier took it upon himself to steal the Cosmic Cube and save his dead friends in the past. 

This triggers an alternative reality to emerge where most of the Avengers are wiped from time. Doctor Strange manages to send the Invaders and the surviving members of the Avengers into the past before being wiped from time himself.

In the past, the soldier raised his dead friends and healed a dying Union Jack. The soldier then attempted to destroy the Nazis with the Cosmic Cube, but lost it when he was attacked by Red Skull henchmen. The Red Skull I later came into possession of the Cosmic Cube and transformed the world into one made in his own image. Elsewhere, the Invaders and the Avengers arrived in the past, but found that it had dramatically changed. The Avengers took up identities of Golden Age characters so that they could fit into the past without giving the Red Skull I too much information about the future: Luke Cage as the Black Avenger, Iron Man as Electro, Ms. Marvel as the Black Widow, Spider-Man as the Challenger, Spider-Woman as the Silver Scorpion, and Wolverine as Captain Terror. The Wasp uses her powers to stay hidden from sight. They end the Red Skull I&#x27;s reign of terror and restore the original timeline.

At the end of the series, Toro is revived in the modern era, thanks to Bucky I&#x27;s temporary acquisition of the Cube. His story is continued in the eight-issue limited series &quot;The Torch&quot;, which deals with the resurrection of the original Human Torch. In the series, the two Golden Age heroes battle the Mad Thinker and the Inhuman Torch.

===&quot;Invaders Now!&quot;===
In September 2010, Marvel launched &quot;Invaders Now!&quot;, a miniseries starring Captain America (Barnes), the original Human Torch, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Captain Steve Rogers, Spitfire, and Toro. The Invaders are all reunited by the original Vision and Union Jack to face a resurfaced threat from World War II. This threat manifests as a disease that mutates those infected, causing horrible deformation, granting superhuman strength, and driving the victim insane with pain and rage. Those infected are driven to attack and thereby infect others. In World War II this pathogen was created by Arnim Zola, as his last project before suffering the wounds which necessitated his consciousness being transferred into his robotic form. To contain the plague, the Invaders had to kill the entire population of a village in the Netherlands, including some who had been infected, but had not yet transformed. In this miniseries, the infection reappears in the modern era.

===&quot;All-New Invaders&quot;===
In 2014, Marvel launched a new series written by James Robinson and starring Captain America who is eventually replaced by Sam Wilson, Winter Soldier, the original Human Torch, and Namor the Sub-Mariner. A Japanese heroine named Radiance (the granddaughter of Golden Girl) joins the team during the book&#x27;s second arc, and the daughter of Iron Cross joins in issue # 10.

===&quot;Invaders&quot; (vol. 3)===
In January 2019, Marvel launched a new series written by Chip Zdarsky that saw original members Captain Steve Rogers, the Winter Soldier, and the original Human Torch reunite to stop another original member, Namor the Sub-Mariner who has become a global threat and mentally unstable/deranged.

<text>Bessel is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the southern half of the Mare Serenitatis. The crater was named after the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1935. Despite its small size, this is the largest crater to lie entirely within the mare. It lies to the north-northeast of the crater Menelaus.

This crater is circular and bowl-shaped with a rim that has a higher albedo than the floor or the surrounding mare. The outer rim is not significantly worn, and there are no features of note on the interior, apart from some slumping of material from the inner walls to the floor. Bessel is not of sufficient size to have developed the structures of larger craters. 

A large ray crosses the mare from north to south, passing Bessel&#x27;s western side. This ray is enigmatic due to its unclear origin. It appears to originate at the rim of Menelaus crater, yet it aligns with the trajectory of a Tycho ray, suggesting Tycho as a possible source. However, the Tycho ray terminates in the central highlands, hundreds of kilometers south of the Bessel region. Additionally, there are no evident clusters of Tycho secondary craters along the ray between its end in the highlands and the start of the bright ray at Menelaus&#x27; rim.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bessel.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU:
* Bessel A — &quot;See&quot; Sarabhai (crater).
* Bessel E — &quot;See&quot; Bobillier (crater).

<text>Damião Vaz d&#x27;Almeida (born 28 April 1951) served as the 12th prime minister of São Tomé and Príncipe and the vice-president of the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe-Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD). He became Prime Minister on 18 September 2004 after being chosen by his party, and confirmed by President Fradique de Menezes three days after Menezes had dismissed the government of Maria das Neves. D&#x27;Almeida had previously served as minister of labor, employment and solidarity in governments led by Gabriel Arcanjo da Costa and most recently, Maria das Neves. 

He is from Príncipe and has held a number of high positions on the island, most notably president of the Pagué district assembly and president of the Príncipe regional government from 29 April 1995 to 12 April 2002.

Damião Vaz d&#x27;Almeida&#x27;s government consisted of ministers from both the MLSTP-PSD and Independent Democratic Action (ADI) parties.

He presented his resignation to President Menezes on 2 June 2005, saying his working relationship with Menezes had deteriorated to the point where they could no longer work together. The two disagreed about how to handle a civil servants&#x27; strike and about Menezes&#x27;s awarding of offshore oil blocks. Six days after his resignation, a new government led by Maria do Carmo Silveira was sworn in.

<doc id="999406" wikidata="Q41731" url="?curid=999406" title=".as">
<text>.as is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for American Samoa. 

==Registration==
Domain names are free of charge for businesses and individuals resident in or associated with American Samoa.

It is administered by AS Domain Registry. Island Networks, which provides registry services for .gg and .je, is also responsible for the technical operations of .as.

There is no restriction on registrants, and the domain is also popular outside of Samoa. 

== International use ==
A number of .as names have been registered to and used by people, companies and organizations with no connection to American Samoa (for example, people and organizations related to Asturias, a Spanish region). 

&quot;AS&quot; or &quot;A/S&quot; is a suffix indicating a joint stock company in some countries including Norway, Denmark, Estonia and Czech Republic, so this TLD may be of use by companies of this sort. 

Also, some autonomous systems or websites providing information about autonomous systems or BGP, such as bgp4.as, have registered domain names.

==== Domain hacks ====
The .as domain is, sometimes, used as a domain hack, since the suffix &quot;-s&quot; means plural in some languages like English, Spanish, and Portuguese, thus &quot;-as&quot; would be the end of the plural of a word that ends with an &quot;a&quot;. 

Examples of such usage include the Brazilian website escol.as, meaning &quot;schools&quot;, or macc.as/feedback for the public food service feedback form for McDonald&#x27;s in Australia, stemming from the colloquial use of &#x27;Maccas&#x27; to describe the restaurant chain in the country.

==2016 legacy registrar vulnerability==
In April 2016, a security blog publicized a vulnerability in a .AS legacy registrar system which was claimed might have led to exposure of plain-text passwords of domain contacts associated with domains that did not have a registrar. 

This could have potentially allowed an attacker to make modifications to those domains, or even delete them. 

However, following publication, the AS Domain Registry confirmed to the reporter that legacy managed domains were subject to human oversight and authentication of all changes. No attempts had been made to take advantage of this apparent vulnerability, and the potential exploit was confirmed to have been closed.

<text>Bohnenberger is a lunar impact crater that lies near the east edge of the Mare Nectaris, in the foothills of the Montes Pyrenaeus mountain range that forms the perimeter of the mare. To the east beyond the mountains is the larger crater Colombo. 

The crater has a low rim along the north wall, and the floor is somewhat irregular with a set of fractures crossing the floor. Satellite crater Bohnenberger A is also somewhat fractured.

The name of the crater was approved by the IAU in 1935 and refers to German astronomer Johann von Bohnenberger.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bohnenberger.

Patricia Anne Suzette Wilkins was born in 1936 in Jefferson City, Missouri.

She attended the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in the 1960s, and began writing science fiction in order to pay tuition. She gained a PhD in linguistics, and was the first UCSD student ever to write two dissertations (on English and Navajo).

She created the engineered language Láadan for her &quot;Native Tongue&quot; science fiction series. A grammar and dictionary was published in 1985. She supported feminist science fiction, saying &quot;women need to realize that SF is the only genre of literature in which it&#x27;s possible for a writer to explore the question of what this world would be like if you could get rid of [Y], where [Y] is filled in with any of the multitude of real world facts that constrain and oppress women. Women need to treasure and support science fiction.&quot;

In addition, she published works of shorter fiction. Overlying themes in her work include feminism, linguistics and the impact of proper language, and peaceful coexistence with nature. Many of her works also draw from her Ozark background and heritage.

==Later years and death==
Elgin became a professor at San Diego State University (SDSU). She retired in 1980 and lived in Arkansas with her second husband, George Elgin. She died at age 78 in 2015 from undisclosed causes. She was survived by her husband. Her son Michael pre-deceased her.

<doc id="999413" wikidata="Q892854" url="?curid=999413" title="Bonpland (crater)">
<text>Bonpland is the remains of a lunar impact crater that is attached to the walled plain Fra Mauro to the north and Parry to the east. The intersection of their rims forms a three-pointed mountainous rise. To the southeast is the small crater Tolansky. Bonpland lies on the eastern edge of Mare Cognitum. It is named after Aimé Bonpland, a French explorer and botanist.
This rim of Bonpland is heavily worn and eroded, with the intrusion of Parry in the east creating a bulging extension to the southeast. The floor has been flooded by lava in the past, leaving a relatively flat surface that is broken by a series of narrow clefts. These are collectively designated the Rimae Parry. The clefts cross the rim to the south and also to the north, extending into the neighboring Fra Mauro.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bonpland.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Bonpland E — &quot;See&quot; Kuiper (lunar crater).

<doc id="999415" wikidata="Q119348" url="?curid=999415" title="Irvin Kershner">
<text>Irvin Kershner (born Isadore Kershner; April 29, 1923November 27, 2010) was an American director for film and television.

Early in his career as a filmmaker he directed quirky, independent drama films, while working as a lecturer at the University of Southern California. Later, he transitioned to high-budget blockbusters such as &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, the James Bond adaptation &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;. Through the course of his career, he received numerous accolades, including being nominated for both a Primetime Emmy Award and a Palme d&#x27;Or.

==Early life==
Irvin Kershner was born in Philadelphia, to Russian-Jewish parents. His artistic and cultural background was a mixture of music and art. The study of music (violin, viola and composition) was the most important activity of his early years. He attended Temple University&#x27;s Tyler School of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Later, he went to New York and Provincetown to study with the famous painting teacher Hans Hofmann. He then moved to Los Angeles where he studied photography at the Art Center College of Design.

During World War II, Kershner served three years with the U.S. Eighth Air Force as a flight engineer. He later began his film career at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, teaching photography and taking cinema courses under Slavko Vorkapić, a montage artist and then-dean of the School. Kershner then accepted a job as still photographer on a State Department film project in Iran under the Point Four Program, which ultimately led to an assignment as a director and cinematographer of documentaries in Iran, Greece and Turkey with the United States Information Service.

==Career==
When he returned to the States, he and Paul Coates developed &quot;Confidential File&quot;, a documentary television series. Kershner worked as writer, director, cinematographer and editor. He later developed and directed the television series &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1959–61), as well as the pilots for &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;, &quot;Philip Marlowe&quot;, and others.

He then moved on to feature films, including: &quot;The Hoodlum Priest&quot; (which starred Don Murray); &quot;The Luck of Ginger Coffey&quot; (with Robert Shaw and Mary Ure); &quot;A Fine Madness&quot; (with Sean Connery, Joanne Woodward, and Jean Seberg); &quot;The Flim-Flam Man&quot; (starring Michael Sarrazin, George C. Scott and Sue Lyon); &quot;Loving&quot; (with George Segal and Eva Marie Saint); &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot; (with Barbra Streisand); &quot;The Return of a Man Called Horse&quot; (starring Richard Harris); the critically acclaimed TV movie &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; (a true-life drama which was nominated for nine Emmys, including Best Direction); and the supernatural thriller &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; (starring Faye Dunaway and Tommy Lee Jones).

Kershner was the son of Jewish immigrants. He considered himself an internationalist, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been a student of Christianity. I&#x27;ve been interested in the historical basis of the Muslim religion. I studied Buddhism. I don&#x27;t think of myself as a Jew except by birth, as I don&#x27;t follow the customs. I&#x27;m a Jew because other people consider me so. My pride is in being international.&quot;

===&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;===
Kershner directed &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), the sequel of the 1977 hit film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Writer-producer George Lucas knew Kershner as a teacher in the film program at USC School of Cinematic Arts. Kershner was a surprising choice in directing the film. According to Kershner himself, he once asked Lucas: &quot;Of all the younger guys around, all the hot-shots, why me?&quot; Lucas replied: &quot;Well, because you know everything a Hollywood director is supposed to know, but you&#x27;re not Hollywood.&quot;

Kershner, who was an appealing directorial candidate to Lucas because of his concern for character development, was at first reluctant to direct the film. When asked by Lucas to work on the project over lunch, Kershner refused. Kershner&#x27;s agent was told about the meeting and encouraged him to take the job. Kershner later discussed his motivations: &quot;I was grabbed by the fairytale which Lucas invented and wanted to be part of keeping it alive.&quot; Of his cinematic style, Kershner has said: &quot;I like to fill up the frame with the characters&#x27; faces. There&#x27;s nothing more interesting than the landscape of the human face&quot;.

Kershner turned down a chance to direct &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), having spent almost three years of work on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Richard Marquand was eventually chosen to direct the third film in the original trilogy. Kershner stated, in retrospect, that he would have accepted an offer to direct one of the films of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy had they been produced sooner, as Lucas originally estimated the first of them to be ready for release in 1988 rather than in 1999.

===Later work===
Kershner had projects that he was going to be involved with in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He signed on to direct an adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; from a script by Harlan Ellison, which was never filmed. Later, he was initially hired by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown to direct an adaptation of Eric Van Lustbader&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ninja&quot; from scripts by W.D. Richter and Tom Cole, but the project was cancelled following months of pre-production.

After &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Kershner directed &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (Sean Connery&#x27;s return to the role of James Bond), the HBO film &quot;Traveling Man&quot; (starring John Lithgow and Jonathan Silverman, this film earned Kershner an ACE Award nomination), and &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;. He also directed the pilot of the television series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, and he made his debut as an actor in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), in which he played Zebedee, the father of the apostles James and John. He played a film director in Steven Seagal&#x27;s &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;. He was a faculty member at the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California. In 2000, he was a member of the jury at the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival.

In fall 2002, spring 2003, fall 2004, and spring 2004, Kershner served as a Visiting Professor and Research Associate at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he also provided cinematography training. He and the founding director Martha Nell Smith remained close and he served as her advisor until the end of his life.

==Death==

Kershner died on November 27, 2010, at his home in Los Angeles, after a 3½-year battle with lung cancer. Kershner had been working on photographic projects before his death. He was looked after by his two sons, David and Dana.

<doc id="999423" wikidata="Q725999" url="?curid=999423" title="F. M. Cornford">
<text>Francis Macdonald Cornford (27 February 1874 – 3 January 1943) was an English classical scholar and translator known for work on ancient philosophy, notably Plato, Parmenides, Thucydides, and ancient Greek religion. Frances Cornford, his wife, was a noted poet. Due to the similarity in their names, he was known in the family as &quot;FMC&quot; and his wife as &quot;FCC&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Cornford was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, on 27 February 1874. He attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London.

In 1909 Cornford married the poet Frances Darwin, daughter of Sir Francis Darwin and Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, née Crofts, and a granddaughter of Charles Darwin. They had five children:
*Helena (1913–1994), who married Joseph L. Henderson in 1934 
*John (1915–1936), poet and Communist killed in the Spanish Civil War
*Christopher (1917–1993), artist and writer, the father of Adam Cornford
*Hugh Wordsworth (1921–1997), medical doctor
*Ruth Clare (1923–1992), mother of Matthew Chapman

==Career==
Cornford was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a Fellow from 1899 and held a teaching post from 1902. He became the first Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy in 1931 and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1937. He used wit and satire to propagate proposals for reforming the teaching of the classics at Cambridge, in &quot;Microcosmographia Academica&quot; (1908).

Cornford coined the phrase &quot;twin pillars of Platonism&quot;, referring to the theory of Forms on the one hand, and, on the other the doctrine of immortality of the soul.

==Death==
He died on 3 January 1943 in his home, Conduit Head in Cambridge. He was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 6 January 1943.

==Works==
*&quot;Thucydides Mythistoricus&quot; (1907) put the argument that Thucydides&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; was informed by Thucydides&#x27;s tragic view.
*&quot;&quot; (1912) sought the deep religious and social concepts that informed the early Greek philosophers. He returned to this in &quot;Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought&quot; (posthumous, 1952).
*&quot;Microcosmographia Academica&quot; (1908) was an insider&#x27;s satire on academic politics. It was the source of catch phrases such as the &quot;doctrine of unripeness of time&quot;, the &quot;principle of the wedge&quot; and the &quot;principle of the dangerous precedent&quot;.
*&quot;Before and After Socrates&quot; (1932)
*&quot;Plato&#x27;s Cosmology : The Timaeus of Plato.&quot; Hackett Publishing Company (1935)
*According to the preface to &quot;The Republic of Plato&quot;, translated with an introduction and notes (OUP, 1941), it &quot;aims at conveying... as much as possible of the thought of the &quot;Republic&quot; in the most convenient and least misleading form.&quot;

<text>The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is a Eurasian woodpecker belonging to the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The white-backed woodpecker was described by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802 under the binomial name &quot;Picus leucotos&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;leucotos&quot; combines the Classical Greek &quot;leukos&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; and &quot;-nōtos&quot; meaning &quot;-backed&quot;. The type locality is Silesia, a historical region mainly located in Poland. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816.

Twelve subspecies are recognised.
* &quot;D. l. leucotos&quot; (Bechstein, 1802) – widespread across Eurasia from north, central and eastern Europe to northeast Asia, Korea and Sakhalin
* &quot;D. l. uralensis&quot; (Malherbe, 1860) – west Ural Mountains to Lake Baikal
* &quot;D. l. lilfordi&quot; (Sharpe &amp; Dresser, 1871) – Pyrenees to Asia Minor, Caucasus and Transcaucasia
* &quot;D. l. tangi&quot; Cheng, 1956 – Sichuan province, western China

* &quot;D. l. insularis&quot; (Gould, 1863) – Taiwan

The subspecies &quot;D. l. owstoni&quot; is sometimes considered a distinct species, the Amami woodpecker.

== Description ==
It is the largest of the spotted woodpeckers in the western Palearctic, 24–26 cm long with wing-span 38–40 cm. The plumage is similar to the great spotted woodpecker, but with white bars across the wings rather than spots, and a white lower back. The male has a red crown, the female a black one. Drumming by males is very loud, calls include a soft &quot;kiuk&quot; and a longer &quot;kweek&quot;.

== Distribution ==
The nominate race &quot;D. l. leucotos&quot; occurs in central and northern Europe, with the race &quot;D. l. lilfordi&quot; found in the Balkans and Turkey. Ten further races occur in the region eastwards as far as Korea and Japan. It is a scarce bird, requiring large tracts of mature deciduous forests with high amounts of standing and laying dead wood. Numbers have decreased in Nordic countries. In Sweden, its population decline has caused the Swedish government to enact protection for the species in the national Biodiversity Action Plan.

== Ecology ==
In the breeding season it excavates a nest hole about 7 cm wide and 30 cm deep in a decaying tree trunk. It lays three to five white eggs and incubates for 10–11 days. It lives predominantly on wood-boring beetles as well as their larvae, as well as other insects, nuts, seeds and berries.

=== Life Span ===
In the wild the white-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) can survive between three and four years, while in captivity they can survive for approximately eleven years.

<text>Boscovich is a lunar impact crater that has been almost completely eroded away by subsequent impacts. It is located west-northwest of the crater Julius Caesar, and south-southeast of the prominent Manilius. The crater floor has a low albedo, and the dark hue makes it relatively easy to recognize. The surface is crossed by the rille system designated Rimae Boscovich that extends for a diameter of 40 kilometres. The crater is named after Croatian physicist Roger Joseph Boscovich.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boscovich.

<text>Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India was formed in 1988 through the merger of the Anand and Harbhajan Sohi factions of UCCRI(ML), CPI(ML) Chandrashekar group, Revolutionary Communist Party and Organizing Committee, CPI(ML). The initiative was taken by the two UCCRI(ML) splinter groups.

In August 1994 CCRI merged with the Punjab section of CPI(ML) Central Team, Communist Unity Centre of India and Marxist-Leninist Organising Centre to form the Communist Party Reorganisation Centre of India (Marxist-Leninist).

<doc id="999439" wikidata="Q146938" url="?curid=999439" title="Claw of Archimedes">
<text>The Claw of Archimedes (; also known as the iron hand) was an ancient weapon devised by Archimedes to defend the seaward portion of Syracuse&#x27;s city wall against amphibious assault. Although its exact nature is unclear, the accounts of ancient historians seem to describe it as a sort of crane equipped with a grappling hook that was able to drop and partly submerge an attacking ship down into the water, then either cause the ship to capsize or suddenly let it go altogether. It was dropped onto enemy ships, which would then swing on to defensive forces and destroy them.

These machines featured prominently during the Second Punic War in 214 BC, when the Roman Republic attacked Syracuse with a fleet of 60 quinqueremes under Marcus Claudius Marcellus. When the Roman fleet approached the city walls under cover of darkness, the machines were deployed, sinking many ships and throwing the attack into confusion. Historians such as Livy attributed heavy Roman losses to these machines, together with catapults also devised by Archimedes.

The plausibility of this invention was tested in 1999 in the BBC series &quot;Secrets of the Ancients&quot; and again in early 2005 in the Discovery Channel series &quot;Superweapons of the Ancient World&quot;. The producers of &quot;Superweapons&quot; brought together a group of engineers tasked with conceiving and implementing a design that was realistic, given what is known about Archimedes. Within seven days they were able to test their creation, and they did succeed in tipping over a model of a Roman ship so that it would sink. While this does not prove the existence of the Claw, it suggests that it would have been possible.

<doc id="999440" wikidata="Q71434" url="?curid=999440" title="Johann VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg">
<text>Count John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg (22 November 1536 – 8 October 1606) was the second son of William the Rich and the younger brother of William the Silent. He has a special place in the history of the Netherlands because he is the male-line forefather of the House of Orange.

John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg was a Count of Nassau in Dillenburg. Other names he had were &quot;Jan VI&quot; or &quot;Jan de Oude&quot; (&quot;John the Elder&quot;, to distinguish him from his 2nd son, &quot;John the Middle&quot;, and his grandson &quot;John the Younger&quot;).

John VI was born in Dillenburg, the second son of Count William I of Nassau-Dillenburg and his second wife Juliane of Stolberg-Wernigerode and brother of William I of Orange. He was the principal author of the Union of Utrecht.

<text>Byrgius is a lunar impact crater located in the western part of the Moon, near the limb. As a result, Byrgius appears strongly oval in shape due to foreshortening. To the northwest is the nearly ruined crater Lamarck. The rim of Byrgius is worn and eroded, with Byrgius A overlying the eastern rim and Byrgius D lying across the northwest. The floor is relatively flat and undistinguished by significant craters. Byrgius A possesses its own ray system that extends for over 400 kilometres.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Byrgius.

==Protection in the EU and UK==
The traditional production method for Bacalhau is protected in the EU and UK as a traditional speciality guaranteed under the name &quot;Bacalhau de Cura Tradicional Portuguesa&quot;.

==History==
Salt cod has been produced for at least 500 years, since the time of the European discoveries of the New World. Before refrigeration, there was a need to preserve the cod; drying and salting are ancient techniques to preserve nutrients and the process makes the cod tastier. More importantly, fish low in oils and fats are more suitable for the drying and preservation process, as oils and fats prevent the salt from preserving the fish. Cod have very low levels of oils and fats in their muscle tissue, and most is located in the liver.

Portuguese, Norman, Breton, and English fisherman were the first to adopt the salt-based curing technique from Basque fishermen in Newfoundland near the cod-rich Grand Banks by the late 1500s. By the 1700s, salted cod had become a staple food for ordinary Portuguese people and by upper levels of Portuguese society. With the advancements in freezing and transportation in the 1900s, salted cod from North America declined and Iceland and Norway became the major supplier of the salted fish to Portuguese markets. During this time was a cheap source of protein and frequently consumed. Thus, &#x27; became a staple of the Portuguese cuisine, nicknamed &#x27; (&#x27;loyal friend&#x27;). In fact, in Portugal, &quot;cod&quot; always refers to salted, dried codfish and it is very rare to find fresh cod () for sale.

This dish is also popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries because of historical fasting rules, which forbade the eating of meat on many days (Fridays, Lent, and other festivals), and so &quot;&quot; dishes were eaten instead. is also popular in Sfax where this dish is eaten with chermoula on the first day of Eid ul-Fitr .

In Portugal, &#x27; is often sold as a generic product with no brand information. Customers are free to touch, smell, and otherwise personally inspect the fish, which is very different from how fresh seafood is often sold. Stores can carry a large variety of &#x27; differing in color, size, smell, taste, and dryness. Such variation has led Portugal to define requirements as to what products can carry the label . They are however, graded by weight which often defines what price category the is sold under. The largest is , which are large pieces of whole fish weighing more than 4 kg. Following this are (4–2 kg), (2–1 kg), (1–0.5 kg) and (below 500g).

<doc id="999456" wikidata="Q3249778" url="?curid=999456" title="List of James Bond gadgets">
<text>This is a list of &quot;James Bond&quot; gadgets featured in the &quot;Bond&quot; films, organised by the film eras of its actor. The original books and early adaptations had only relatively minimal pieces like the modified attache case in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;. The &quot;James Bond&quot; films have featured an array of exotic equipment and vehicles, which often prove to be critically useful to Bond. 

However, the gadgets took on a more spectacular profile starting with the film version of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and its tremendous success encouraged the following films to have Bond supplied with still more equipment. For instance, it became an expected scene in each film where Q would present and demonstrate Bond&#x27;s assigned tools for the mission, and it was a near guarantee that each and every piece would be invaluable to Bond in the field. &quot;Bond&quot; gadgets became an example of the literary technique of Chekhov&#x27;s gun. Fans eventually complained that the use of gadgets became excessive in the Roger Moore films, particularly in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, and subsequent productions struggled to find a balance in which gadgets could have a place without giving the impression that the character unduly depended on them or using stories that arbitrarily included situations that exactly fit the use of the gadgets assigned.

This article concerns the gadgets James Bond typically carried on his person, along with gadgets and gimmicks used by allies and villains. It does not include the main doomsday device associated with the film. It does not include makeshift gadgets or weapons, animals, or general spy equipment and installations such as disguises / fake passports, surveillance equipment, secret passages / trap doors, remote-controlled detonations, unless particularly notable.

== Sean Connery era (1962–1967; 1971) ==

=== &quot;Dr. No&quot; ===

; Geiger counter: Bond has to request one from Britain before using it to determine the radioactivity of Crab Key&#x27;s rocks, suggesting they were uncommon pieces of equipment. The very first &quot;James Bond&quot; gadget.
; Cigarette with cyanide: Used by the &quot;chauffeur&quot; to commit suicide rather than being interrogated by Bond.
; Dragon tank: Tank vehicle equipped with flamethrowers but popularised as a dragon.
; Bionic Hands: Dr. No&#x27;s signature prosthetic hands, which he started using after losing his real hands to experiments on radiation. They possess great strength, but lack dexterity.

=== &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; ===

; James Bond&#x27;s briefcase:
: A special briefcase issued to all double-0 personnel featuring:
* AR-7 .25 calibre (the AR-7 was chambered for .22 LR only, so this is either a one-off by Q branch, or an error), survival rifle with infrared telescope and detachable suppressor. Another error is that Bond tells Kerim that he only has one shot, but the AR-7 was semi-automatic, supplied with two magazines in the butt-stock/storage.
* Twenty rounds of ammunition for the rifle concealed within the case
* 50 gold sovereigns concealed within the case
* Tear gas cartridge disguised as talcum powder, set to discharge when the briefcase is opened incorrectly.
* Spring-loaded throwing knife accessible from the case&#x27;s outside.
; Bug detector : A small device that detects the presence of phone taps.
; Dagger shoe : A shoe with a concealed poisoned blade tip. Worn by SPECTRE agents, including Rosa Klebb and Morzeny.

; Garrote watch : A wristwatch from which a wire garrote can be drawn. Preferred weapon by SPECTRE assassin recruit Red Grant.
; Periscope : A gift from the Royal Navy installed below the Russian embassy. Used to spy on the Russian conference room.

The hat is capable of slicing through stone and metal or breaking a person&#x27;s neck when thrown hard enough (although it would most likely be capable of severing the neck, and not just breaking it).
; Homing beacons: Also known as “homers”, used to track people. A miniaturised one is placed in the heel of Bond&#x27;s shoe; another, larger one, is placed on car and can be tracked up to 150 miles.
; Industrial laser: Used by Goldfinger trying to kill Bond. Powerful enough to put a laser dot on the moon, but at very close range able to cut through steel. This laser was later used to cut open the vault of Fort Knox. This film showcases the very first of its kind, as this weapon takes on various forms throughout the &quot;James Bond&quot; series.
; Parking meter that releases tear gas: One of Q&#x27;s gadgets under test.

; Miniature Very pistol: a pocket-sized flare gun firing a red signalling beacon.
; Cassette recorder hidden in book : Bond uses this to learn that Quist is hiding in his hotel room.
; Electrocution staff chair :With the press of a button, Blofeld electrocutes the staff member on the seat which he sits on, then the seat drops down into the floor and comes back empty.
; Skyhook : Comes as a grappling suspender attached to a weather balloon that Bond can attach to his utility harness. With the aid of a specialised aircraft (B-17) installed with specialised braces, Bond and Domino are hoisted up into the air and out of the area.

=== &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; ===

; Mini-rocket cigarette : Tiger Tanaka gives Bond a cigarette capable of shooting a rocket-powered projectile accurately up to 30 yards. Used in Blofeld&#x27;s volcano to kill a technician standing by the entrance controls to enable his allies to storm the base.
; Waterproof body bag : Used at Bond&#x27;s own &quot;funeral&quot;, this bag is waterproof and equipped with a breathing mask enabling Bond to breathe while being dumped overboard. The bag is even waterproof enough to allow him to wear a complete uniform before his briefing with M.
; Jet Propelled Bullets: Developed by Tiger Tanaka&#x27;s facility, these bullet feature extra jet propulsion for added firepower. However they were not used.
; Gyrojet rocket guns: Prototype guns using a small rocket-propelled projectile rather than conventional ammunition. A limited number were made in real life for trials by the US and British military forces, but the design never caught on, and the guns and ammunition are now very collectible (and therefore highly sought after and expensive).
; X-Ray Desk: Used by Osato to identify any concealed firearms that his prospective &#x27;clients&#x27; may have.
; Poison-delivering string : Used by a Japanese SPECTRE assassin to deliver a dose of poison from an attic by having it running along its length to land directly in the victim&#x27;s mouth. Referenced or used several times in subsequent popular culture as well, such as in the gamebook series &quot;The Way of the Tiger&quot;.
; Bo with retractable spear: Used by a SPECTRE henchmen who infiltrated Tanaka&#x27;s base in an attempt to assassinate Bond.
; Lipstick gas: Helga Brant uses a lipstick case to discharge disorienting gas.
; Safe Cracking Machine : A pocket-sized device used by Bond to decipher the combination lock code of Osato&#x27;s office safe.

=== &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; ===

; Biometric fingerprint scanner: A projector-like device used by Tiffany Case in her Amsterdam apartment to identify her guests. One such example of how this device is used is when she takes the glass which Bond was using, then dusting the surface for a print and running it through the device and comparing it with a known fingerprint sample of her supposed guest.
; Fake fingerprint : Bond uses a fake fingerprint that clings to his thumb to trick Tiffany Case into believing he is Peter Franks.
; Piton pistol: Fires a grappling piton, complete with line; range about 10–15 metres. Also used as an improvised weapon against one of Blofeld&#x27;s doppelgangers.
; Pocket snap trap : A small gadget hidden in a pocket to give a person performing an unwanted search on the wielder a painful surprise.
; Electromagnetic RPM Controller Ring: Q created a ring that, when used, ensures a jackpot at any mechanical slot machine.
; Voice changer : Blofield uses this to trick employees that he is Willard Whyte. Q puts together a makeshift one to fool Blofield, remarking that he made one for &quot;the kids last Christmas.&quot;
; Water ball : Used by Bond to &quot;walk&quot; on water when he is parachuted near Blofield&#x27;s platform.

=== &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (non-Eon; 1983) ===

; Solex Agitator : Device that enables the utilisation of solar energy as a power source on an industrial scale.
; Solar Power Plant : A facility developed by Scaramanga during his apprenticeship with Hi-Fat which utilises the solar power from the Solex Agitatior. Scaramanga had plans to sell it to the highest bidder before the facility was destroyed indirectly by Goodnight.

<text>.ba is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is administered by the University Teleinformation Center.

== Registration ==
The procedure for registering domains within .ba is slightly more complicated than in other ccTLDs; the process is defined by laws and regulations of BiH institutions. 

While international domains can be bought by anyone without any additional requests and documents, .BA domains can be registered by only entities that meet all requirements listed in the Regulations. 

While domain registration is free, a local presence is needed. Any company that has a registered name or registered trademark in Bosnia–Herzegovina can register an eponymous .BA domain (provided that the domain is not already taken), though some additional caveats apply.

== Second-level domains ==
Privately owned second-level domains are permitted, which for-profit companies use. But there are also standardised second level domains:

The rules for the standardised second level domains are fairly well enforced.

<text>.bb is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for Barbados. It is administered by Telecommunications Unit which is part of the &quot;Ministry of Innovations, Science and Smart Technologies&quot; for the Barbados Government.

==History==
The .bb top-level domain has been maintained by several administrators since its creation, the first of which being the University of Puerto Rico. 

In 1996, the Government of Barbados sought the relegation of .bb to the incumbent local exchange carrier, Cable &amp; Wireless (BARTEL) Ltd. 

A 2001 Memorandum of Understanding was then later signed between the Government of Barbados and both Cable &amp; Wireless (Bartel) Ltd. and its sister company Cable &amp; Wireless (BET) Ltd., to continue the administration of the &quot;.bb&quot; domains until the government selected alternate directives. 

In November 2007, .bb was again relegated to the Telecoms Unit within the Government of Barbados.

== Registration ==
The Government has indicated that the government&#x27;s policy will be to maintain a semi-restricted domain. 

Legal issues regarding domains are to be handled by the Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office (CAIPO) arm of the Government.

The fee for Barbados&#x27; main ccTLD and all of the second and third-level domains is BBD$120 annually, significantly higher than most other domains.

At present. the .bb namespace does not allow for commercial licenses to entities without some connection to Barbados. Any person desirous of registering a &quot;.bb&quot; domain is required to fill out Form TU052 and send it the Telecommunications Unit for review.

== Second-level domains ==
==Timeline==

*1991-09 – University of Puerto Rico is delegated the .bb domain.
*1996 – The .bb ccTLD becomes re-delegated from Univ. of Puerto Rico to Cable &amp; Wireless.
*2001-10-16 – The Government of Barbados and Cable &amp; Wireless sign a MOU for the later to maintain interim-administration of the .bb ccTLD.
*2007-11 – The Government of Barbados assumes total administration and control of the .bb ccTLD from C&amp;W.

<text>A ged is a heraldic term for the fish known in English as a pike. It is often used in &quot;canting&quot; coats; that is, using coats of arms to make a pun on the last name of the bearer, one of his titles, a nickname, or the name of his estate. The word &quot;ged&quot; is derived from the Old Norse &quot;&quot; (spike). The Norse word is the origin of the terms for pike in the modern North Germanic languages: , , , and the Faroese and .

<text>.ax is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Åland, Finland, introduced in 2006. 

==History==
Previously, most Åland websites were under the .aland.fi subdomain.

On 17 February 2006, the Finnish parliament approved a modification of the laws regulating Finnish domain names to include the .ax top-level domain. 

During a three-year period, the aland.fi subdomain was phased out while .ax was used in parallel; no new registrations under the aland.fi subdomain were to be accepted, and all owners of domains under the aland.fi subdomain would receive registrations for the corresponding .ax domain.

On 17 March 2006, Finnish president Tarja Halonen signed the bill into law, effective as of 27 March. The government of Åland began accepting registrations immediately following the changing of the law.

On 9 June 2006, ICANN approved delegating the .ax top-level domain to the government of Åland. The .ax domain was added to the root zone on 21 June 2006, and became active on 15 August 2006. 

The code ax itself comes from the ISO 3166 standard, and was assigned to Åland in 2004. 

The letter X is not included in any major or locally used language, but other possible codes were already taken, e.g. .al by Albania, .ad by Andorra, and .an by what was at the time the Netherlands Antilles.

Since 5 September 2016, anyone worldwide is permitted to register domain names under the .ax TLD.

Win Aung was born in Dawei (formerly Tavoy), Tanintharyi Division in 1944. Win Aung would later join the armed forces, where he served as a military intelligence officer.

Since Win Aung served as an ambassador to Germany and the UK until he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in November 1998. During his tenure as foreign minister, he often bore the brunt of international criticism on many issues, especially for his government&#x27;s repression of political dissidents such as Aung San Suu Kyi, while visiting foreign nations. In September 2004, he was dismissed from his post, along with several other ministers, following a purge of members of the Military Intelligence faction of the State Peace and Development Council.

Win Aung was a close associate of former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, who was among those purged in September 2004. Following his dismissal, Win Aung was arrested and sent to the notorious Insein Prison. He died there on 4 November 2009 at the age of 65. At the time of his death, he was the only former Burmese government minister to be imprisoned.

Win Aung&#x27;s son, Thaung Su Nyein, is CEO of Seven Days News, a widely read journal in Myanmar.

<doc id="999473" wikidata="Q819521" url="?curid=999473" title="John VII, Count of Nassau-Siegen">
<text>Count John VII the Middle of Nassau-Siegen (7 June 1561 – 27 September 1623), , official titles: &quot;Graf zu Nassau, Katzenelnbogen, Vianden und Diez, Herr zu Beilstein&quot;, was since 1606 Count of Nassau-Siegen, a part of the County of Nassau, and the progenitor of the House of Nassau-Siegen, a cadet branch of the Ottonian Line of the House of Nassau.

John was one of the most important military theorists of his time, who introduced many innovations and inventions. His &quot;Kriegsbuch&quot; contained all the military knowledge of his time, but also many new ideas, which made an essential contribution to the reform of the Dutch States Army by his cousin Maurice. John served in the Dutch States Army, was colonel general of the Palatinate and commander-in-chief of the Swedish army. His reputation reached far beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. As a mediator, John successfully continued the example set by his grandfather William the Rich.

==Biography==

John was born at on 7 June 1561 as the second son of Count John VI the Elder of Nassau-Siegen and his first wife Landgravine Elisabeth of Leuchtenberg.

John first attended the Counts&#x27; School in Siegen and then – in 1576 – went to the Heidelberg University together with his three oldest brothers William Louis, George and Philip and his cousin Maurice of Nassau, but left the university the following year at his father&#x27;s request. He did not regret his departure at all, because he found &quot;das Studieren nicht anmutig&quot; (&quot;studying not graceful&quot;). John got involved early in the administration, finances and military affairs of his father&#x27;s county.

John the Elder had plans to reorganise the finances of the county of Nassau-Siegen through a rich marriage of his son, but when John the Middle declared that he had already given his heart, the father did not make the slightest attempt to let political reason prevail over the son&#x27;s wish. This speaks for the characters of father and son, who always got along very well and complemented each other in the best way. By his marriage in 1581 to Countess Magdalene of Waldeck-Wildungen (like his grandmother Countess Juliane of Stolberg-Wernigerode, widow of a count of Hanau-Münzenberg), John the Middle strengthened the relations within the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot; and thus contributed – even without a substantial financial contribution – to the strengthening of the House of Nassau.

===Military career===
====Contributing to his father&#x27;s military reform====
John experienced his first military campaign under Count Palatine John Casimir in 1583, for which troops were assembled in the area of Siegen. At that time, John became acquainted with the practice of mercenary armies, whose disadvantages his father had described in numerous conversations.

From 1584 onwards, John was engaged in reinforcing the fortifications of Nassau Castle and Dillenburg Castle. During the military reform of John the Elder, especially his introduction of general conscription, John the Middle ensured better training. Realising that conscripted subjects should not be led helplessly to the slaughter, he ensured that the men were properly trained. He ordered standardised rifles of the same caliber for them, so that one could help the other with bullets. And he created uniform clothing, clearly aware that the men would feel like soldiers in that uniform. Uniforms and standardised armaments were something entirely new for that time. The &quot;Siegerländer Landesausschluß&quot; wore a brown hat with a feather and a blue lining, a yellow leather or linen gambeson, a red overcoat with a blue lining and a white collar. Trousers and socks were blue. This uniform corresponded with the costume which had already been acquired in 1481/82 in the Netherlands for the men of the Siegen marksmen&#x27;s guild.

For weapons training, John invented the foot drill. The men were favourably inclined towards this measure, because they saw for themselves how they could gain a huge amount of time by continuous practice in handling weapons and thus had a great advantage over their opponents. In Nassau, and especially in the Siegerland where it was introduced first, there was never any protest against the general conscription, because the population considered the Counts&#x27; struggle for the freedom of the Netherlands as their own. They shared with the territorial lord the biblically founded conviction of the right of this Dutch Revolt against the rape of body and soul.

====In the Dutch States Army====

Relatively late, in 1592, John entered the Dutch Revolt. There he participated in the sieges of Steenwijk and Coevorden. With Prince Maurice, he was more like a brother than as a cousin, because they had spent their youth together in Dillenburg and Siegen. When John showed him and his brother William Louis his notes containing his thoughts on military training, it was &quot;nun wol im anfang ein solches veracht und für Superfluum gehalten&quot; (&quot;despised in the beginning and thought to be superfluous&quot;). But soon Maurice had to realise that the &quot;Ausschußmänner&quot; from the county of Nassau-Siegen and the equally trained peasants from the Westerwald were better than the Dutch soldiers. Immediately, John&#x27;s approach was introduced into all garrisons of the United Provinces. A new type of mortar invented by John, together with the corresponding incendiary bullets, both of which he had made cast in Siegen, was tested at the Siege of Groenlo in 1597 and had a devastating effect.

====Military theorist====
John put his thoughts on paper when they occurred to him: under the titles &quot;Observationes&quot;, &quot;Landesrettungswerk&quot;, &quot;Memorial&quot;, &quot;Discours&quot;, etc. Together they form a &quot;Kriegsbuch&quot; that reflects all military knowledge of the time, but above all contains a wealth of completely new ideas, from the art of large fortifications to the most advantageous arrangement of a &#x27;secret chamber&#x27;. John&#x27;s military writings laid the foundation for the supremacy of the Dutch States Army and thus constituted an essential contribution to the victory. They were republished in 1973. John was one of the most important military theorists of his time and his reputation reached far beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire.

====Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army====
In the great theatre of operations of the Counter-Reformation, King Sigismund III, the Catholic Vasa, had united Poland and Sweden in his hand. His uncle, the Calvinist Duke Charles of Södermanland led the opposition to Sigismund. John thought it was a matter for Protestants to support Charles. Therefore, with the consent of the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;, he travelled to the battlefield in Livonia. However, he first visited his brother William Louis in Friesland, and only when the latter also approved of the plan and John knew that Nassau was in the care of his brother, did he go to Charles, whom he met in Pernau on 16 July 1601. Charles immediately offered John the supreme command, which he accepted &quot;trotz der geringen Lusten&quot; (&quot;despite the low desire&quot;), but only for a period of three months, because the Swedish army was in a more than poor condition. The foot soldiers, for instance, were so miserably armed that John devised and immediately ordered the production of spiked carts, which were pushed in front of the infantry and proved to be a great protection against the attacking cavalry. Such spiked carts were kept in the arsenal of Siegen for decades.

After three months, during which John had won several skirmishes and captured much material from the Poles, but had not been able to bring the Siege of Riga to a successful conclusion, Charles begged him to stay in Livonia and remain in command. John accepted his plea. Immediately afterwards, the cold became so fierce that within six weeks 40,000 people either froze or starved to death, including 4,500 of the 6,000 foot soldiers from Nassau. And again, after three months, John was persuaded to stay. Then, however, first the thaw set in and then a mutiny put an end to all military operations. John wrote in vain to get money to pay the troops. He had long since pawned his collars and jewellery for the troops&#x27; wages. Finally, he really resigned from his duties. Charles provided a Swedish naval ship for the journey to Lübeck, which had to remain on Bornholm for a long time due to violent storms. John&#x27;s wages of 18,000 guilders had still not been paid by the Swedes 29 years later.

And yet the arduous northern journey had brought John something good. He met the youngest daughter of Duke John II the Younger of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (a brother of the Danish king) and married her in 1603, although he already had a son a year older than this Margaret of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. John&#x27;s first wife had died in 1599.

====In the service of the Palatinate====
In 1599, Elector Palatine Frederick IV offered John the post of colonel general to reorganise the country&#x27;s defences. In 1610 John was commander of the Palatine Union troops.

When the Upper Palatinate (where his mother came from) was threatened, the fact that John was ready with thirteen companies of cavalry and six companies of footsoldiers on the Neidenau Heath was enough to keep the enemy, the Passau-Leopoldine folk, from attacking. After this brief appearance in the Upper Palatinate, the city of Nuremberg prepared a welcome for him &quot;wie sonst nicht leichthin geschieht und nur Wenigen widerfährt&quot; (&quot;as otherwise does not happen lightly and happens to only a few&quot;).

In 1621 he organised the defence of the Palatinate against the Spaniards under Spinola. However, the Spanish pressure on Nassau forced him to retreat prematurely and thus ruined his life&#x27;s work.

===Advocate of Protestant Unity===
John was a champion of Protestant political unity against the forces of the Counter-Reformation. However, he rarely achieved greater political influence. Therefore, he lacked the necessary perseverance, despite high intelligence, diligence and agility. The extent of John&#x27;s ambitious political plans and the power of a Protestant Union, as he imagined it, is best shown by the fact that in 1598 he seriously wanted to promote the idea of electing his cousin Maurice of Nassau as German king.

One of the leading Protestant figures of that time was Fürst Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg, who, like John, aspired to a great Protestant alliance against the Habsburgs. But Emperor Rudolf II tried to lure Christian with promises. The fact that Christian did not succumb to this, but remained in the Protestant camp, was regarded by both as John&#x27;s merit. Christian and John became good friends. Their common goal was to win over Elector Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg to the Protestant cause, and to this end they wanted to help him acquire the disputed duchy of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel joined them, and in 1603 the latter married Juliane, the 16-year-old daughter of John.

On 25 March 1609, Duke John William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg died childless. His inheritance was claimed by Palatine Neuburg, Brandenburg, Saxony and Palatine Zweibrücken. The first two candidates were Protestants, the other two Catholics. John, who always wanted the unity of the Protestant camp, wanted to avoid a war between Brandenburg and Palatine Neuburg at all costs, and during preparatory negotiations in Siegen and on 10 June 1609 in Dortmund, he managed to get Count Palatine Wolfgang William of Neuburg and Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg to agree on a common approach. Both asked John to take over the supreme command of their troops, in case the inheritance dispute could not be solved without force of arms. The &quot;Landesrettungsverein&quot; of the Wetterau appointed him colonel, because all trained young nobles were in foreign service. As a mediator, John successfully continued the example set by his grandfather William the Rich.

In September 1610, as an envoy of the Protestant Imperial Estates of the realm, John negotiated with the leader of the Catholic League, Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria, where they reached a mutually satisfactory agreement. In 1615, he mediated an agreement between the city Brunswick and Duke Frederick Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

When the young Elector Palatine Frederick V was urged by the Protestant Imperial Estates to accept the Bohemian crown, he did so after extensive consultation with John and Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg. And while Frederick went to Bohemia to rule that one winter (for which he was later called the Winter King), John prepared the Palatinate for defence. He was also commissioned to draw up plans to strengthen the Rhine from Bonn to Rheinberg, to modernise the fortress of Düsseldorf and to design a system of fortifications for the Ruhr, Ems and Lippe rivers. He had to prepare the national defence for Berg, Mark and Cleves, after he had refused the post of Field Marshal in Jülich.

===Count of Nassau-Siegen===

When his father died on 8 October 1606, John succeeded his father together with his brothers William Louis, George, Ernest Casimir and John Louis. On 30 March 1607 the brothers divided their possessions. John acquired Siegen, Freudenberg, Netphen, Hilchenbach, and the Haingericht. The brothers then also signed a succession treaty. By this agreement the heirs of the brothers were explicitly forbidden to convert to a religion other than the Reformed confession. Since the partition, John has had his &quot;Residenz&quot; in Siegen Castle, which he had renovated around that time.

The sons of his first marriage caused John much and great concern. Both John Ernest and Adolf in The Hague and John the Younger in Kassel had the reputation of being gamblers and of showing a completely unseemly splendour in their clothes and appearance. John wrote letters to these young counts, full of fatherly admonitions, exhorting them to be thrifty, because he did not know what to do with his worries and debts. In a letter of 8 December 1608 he even considered the death of his son Adolf as a punishment from God and he exhorted the two others, who with &quot;einem ärgerlichen Leben mit Verschwendung fast allem, was ich in der Welt habe, durch Ehebrechen und Hurerei, Plünderung und Beraubung armer, unschuldiger Leute hoch und niederen Standen&quot; (&quot;an annoying life of squandering almost everything I have in the world, through adultery and fornication, plundering and robbing poor, innocent people of high and low rank&quot;) ruined the county of Nassau-Siegen, to lead a different, better life, worthy of the name Nassau.

In 1610 John took part in the Princes&#x27; Day in Schwäbisch Hall as the representative of the entire House of Nassau and the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;. In 1612 he travelled to Frankfurt, with his brother George and his two sons John Ernest and John the Younger, for the coronation of Roman King Matthias, whom he congratulated as spokesman of the House of Nassau and many other counts. It was up to him to be the first to cut off a piece of the roast beef in front of the &quot;Römer&quot; and bring it to the royal table.

With his brothers he signed new succession treaties in 1611 and 1613. Noteworthy is the House Treaty with his brother George in 1618 about his not claiming the part of the county of Nassau-Dillenburg that was rightfully his. In 1619 he also signed a treaty with his brothers about the advances that had previously been paid to William the Silent. Finally, the brothers signed a treaty on the division of the lands that had become vacant after the death of William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg and the debts attached to them.

After the outbreak of hostilities in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he initially remained faithful to his old, long-standing connection with the Palatinate, and stayed behind as commander-in-chief of the troops stationed in the Palatinate. In this way, on the approach of the imperial troops and those of the Catholic League, he placed his own country in great danger. Yet it took the most urgent appeals of his brothers to persuade him at last to abandon his friend&#x27;s cause and return to Siegen, where he, martial and capable as he was, diligently devoted himself to all preparations for the protection of town and country.

====Foundation of the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot;====
John&#x27;s idea to give the Protestant cause good leaders for a people&#x27;s army, was the reason for the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot;, founded in Siegen in 1616, probably the world&#x27;s first military academy. The princes John asked for financial support, did not give him a penny. But despite the fact that he was so indebted by supporting the Dutch Revolt, that for some time he considered giving up his residence in Siegen and going to live with his brother William Louis, he nevertheless founded the school. At that time his wife Margaret wrote a letter to King Christian IV of Denmark, asking for the payment of an old debt. Possibly Danish money served to open the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot;. However, the Thirty Years&#x27; War broke out so early that the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot; in Siegen could not be effective and soon ceased to exist.

A strange twist of fate, however, made it possible for two of John&#x27;s descendants to complete abroad what he was not able to complete. Count William of Schaumburg-Lippe founded the famous Portuguese War and Artillery Academy and in Schaumburg-Lippe the Academy for artillery and military engineering (whose most famous pupil was Gerhard von Scharnhorst). The other descendant of John was Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the organiser of the Continental Army and an important aide to George Washington.

====Settlement of the succession by wills of 1607, 1618 and 1621====

When John received the County of Nassau-Siegen in 1607, he decided that such a small country (it had about 9,000 inhabitants and yielded an annual revenue of about 13,000 guilders) should not be divided up again. In order to avoid this, he made a will and testament, which stated that only the eldest son would rule and the other children should be compensated with money or offices. As one of the most convinced advocates of Protestantism, it was particularly painful for John that his second son, John the Younger, converted to the Catholic Church in 1613. This act of his son overshadowed the last years of John&#x27;s life and caused him great anxiety. In a codicil of 8 October 1613 he explicitly stipulated that his heirs had to keep the land in the Reformed confession. At first, the conversion of John the Younger to Catholicism did not change this house law established by the will, because he was not the eldest son. That was John Ernest.

To the great surprise of his relatives, John the Younger joined the Spaniards in 1617 and thus joined the opponents of the House of Nassau and the Dutch Republic. In the same year, his older brother John Ernest died in the service of the Republic of Venice. The transition of John the Younger to the political enemy hit his father as hard as the conversion to Catholicism had hit him. This new situation forced John to ask himself whether an enemy of Nassau and the Netherlands could remain his heir at all. On 15 November 1617, John declared his will of 8 April 1607 to be null and void. Abolition of the primogeniture would have meant a division of the small country, and therefore John opposed all proposals in that direction. Instead, in an amicable agreement, he had his son sign a declaration on 31 December 1617, in which the latter declared that, although he himself was and remained a Catholic, he would not force his subjects to any other than the existing religious confession. All his brothers advised John the Middle to change the primogeniture, but he firmly trusted the word, the letter and the seal of his son, whom he loved in spite of everything, as the latter loved and respected his father. It grieved them both that they had to hurt each other because of the difference in their beliefs. On 22 December 1618 John drew up a second will, which had the above-mentioned promises of his son as a condition and still held on to the primogeniture. However, he imposed the penalty of disinheritance on the introduction of &#x27;papism&#x27;. He explicitly assumed that the Dutch branch of the House of Nassau would come to his aid, just as his father had come to William the Silent&#x27;s aid. He therefore repeatedly turned to his cousin Maurice of Orange to obtain from him an assurance of assistance in the event that his son would not keep his word and would use force in Siegerland with the help of Spanish or imperial troops. But Maurice and the States General showed no interest at all in what was happening in the little County of Nassau-Siegen. This was a bitter disappointment to John, although, on the other hand, he realised that the Netherlands could not intervene everywhere and had enough problems of its own. For a while, he even considered placing a Dutch garrison in Siegen.

Why John the Middle still distrusted his son, in spite of the latter&#x27;s confirmations, cannot be fully elucidated. Maybe it was because John the Younger loudly proclaimed everywhere that no power in the world could prevent him from succeeding in Nassau-Siegen, because the power of the Emperor and the King of Spain was behind him. Perhaps John the Middle also knew the influence of the de Ligne family and the Catholic clergy on his son. It is certain that such rumours were conveyed to him from all sides, and that his relatives and other Protestant Imperial Estates warned him again and again about his son. Only once he was convinced that his son was under the influence of the Jesuits and that the possibility of a Catholic area within the Nassau lands was a danger to the Protestant inhabitants, did he get persuaded to make a new will. On 3 July 1621 he drew up a third will, in which he laid down something that he had always considered to be utterly nonsensical, namely to divide the small county of Nassau-Siegen, which was barely able to support one lord, into three parts. It was an act of pure desperation. His three eldest sons, John the Younger, William and John Maurice, were to receive one third each. The administration of the city of Siegen would remain in joint ownership of the three sons.

For John the Younger, therefore, only one third of the county was provided for in the third will. On 6 August 1621, he was informed of this, with a precise statement of the reasons that had led his father to take this step. On 9 May 1623, i.e. not until two years later, John the Younger protested against this with a letter from Frankfurt to the councillors of Siegen. Of course, in the meantime he had not been idle and had not hesitated to denounce his father to the Emperor. At the time of his letter of protest he was certainly already aware of the &quot;Poenale mandatum cassatorium&quot;, which Emperor Ferdinand II officially issued some time later, on 27 June 1623, informing John the Middle that at the time of making his third will as a fellow combatant of the outlawed Winter King he was not entitled to make a will. He had to revoke it and answer to an imperial court within two months. It seems that John the Younger then shrank from having the imperial decree delivered to his seriously ill father.

===Death, burial and reburial===
John the Middle died at Siegen Castle on 27 September 1623. None of the three sons mentioned in the will were present at the death of their father. On 13 October William and John Maurice arrived in Siegen, and on 26 October John the Younger.

John the Middle had planned a dignified burial vault for the dynasty he founded, in the in Siegen. For this, there are remarkable notes in Latin, partly in elegiac couplets, for a projected memorial and burial place of the sovereign family, from the time around 1620, with the names of all 25 children from his two marriages, also with details of birth, marriage and death of his relatives. Since the project was not carried out, the burials of the members of the sovereign family between 1607 and 1658 took place in the inadequate burial vault under the choir of the mentioned parish church. John the Middle was buried on 5/15 November 1623 in the St. Nicholas Church in Siegen. Georgius Remus wrote a &quot;Leichenpredigt&quot; for him, which was published in Herborn in 1624.

John the Middle was reburied on 29 April 1690 with his two wives in the in Siegen.

===Succession dispute===

Everyone knew that there would be a dispute at the reading of the will on 11 December 1623. John the Younger had the imperial decree read out, and when his brothers were not very impressed by it, he said as he stood up: &quot;Der Kaiser wird uns scheiden!&quot; (&quot;The Emperor will part us!&quot;). He had taken the precaution of obtaining a further imperial decree on 20 November 1623 against Countess Dowager Margaret and her sons, in which the Emperor strictly forbade impeding John&#x27;s assumption of government, his taking possession of the land and his inauguration. On 12 January 1624, John the Younger was able to accept the homage from the city of Siegen, but only because he beforehand had secretly let a squadron of selected horsemen into the town through the castle gate (that is, not through a city gate) in a heavy snowstorm, so that they could not be seen or heard by the town guards.
John the Younger thus received the entire inheritance, and the provisions of the will made in favour of William and John Maurice remained a dead letter. However, on 13/23 January 1624, John the Younger voluntarily ceded the sovereignty over the Hilchenbach district with and some villages belonging to the Ferndorf and Netphen districts, to William. With the exception of John Maurice and George Frederick, the younger brothers accepted only modest appanages. Henceforth, until 1645, the county of Nassau-Siegen had two governments, one in Siegen, the other in Hilchenbach. However, for a short period (1632–1635) this situation underwent a temporary change: during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, his brothers, who were fighting on the Protestant side, rebelled against John the Younger.

Count Louis Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg entered the service of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden on 1 December 1631, who had landed in Germany on 24 June 1630 to intervene in favour of the Protestants in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Countess Dowager Margaret, through the mediation of Louis Henry, turned to Gustavus Adolphus and asked for help against the machinations of her stepson John the Younger. Consequently, on 14 February 1632 the Swedish king sent an order from Frankfurt to Louis Henry to provide military support for his first cousin John Maurice. Louis Henry then occupied the city of Siegen with his regiment of Dutch and Swedish soldiers. One day later, on 29 February, John Maurice and his brother Henry arrived in Siegen. Just as John the Younger had kept his cavalry in reserve eight years earlier, now John Maurice and Henry, supported by the presence of the Swedish regiment, negotiated with the citizens, who felt bound by the oath they had sworn to John the Younger. On 4 March, after long and difficult negotiations, the citizens paid homage to John Maurice and Henry. John Maurice obtained for himself not only the Freudenberg district, which his father had intended for him in the will of 1621, but also Netphen, which had been intended for John the Younger in the same will. William was not only confirmed in the possession of Hilchenbach, but also received Ferndorf and Krombach, as stipulated in his father&#x27;s will. The city of Siegen paid homage only to William and John Maurice, who only in 1635 admitted their elder brother John the Younger back into co-sovereignty. However, the latter soon restored the old order: in 1636, he again became the sole owner of his father&#x27;s property, with the exception of Hilchenbach, which he left to William, and he again governed the city of Siegen alone. John Maurice was again excluded from the county&#x27;s sovereignty. However, in 1642 he inherited the territory from his brother William in accordance with his father&#x27;s will.

John the Younger died in Ronse on 27 July 1638. His only son John Francis Desideratus was born in Nozeroy on 28 July 1627. His mother acted as regent until his marriage in 1651. He made several attempts to obtain the whole Siegerland. In 1646 he visited the Emperor in Vienna to protest against his uncle John Maurice&#x27;s seizure of the county. On 22 January 1645, after his return from Brazil, the latter, with his brothers George Frederick and Henry and an 80-man entourage, had forcibly occupied Siegen Castle and on 15 February had received the renewed homage from the citizens, albeit this time only for two thirds of the county. In order to end the constant dispute, John Maurice wanted to adhere strictly to his father&#x27;s will of 1621 and leave his nephew John Francis Desideratus the one third that was due to him. Already before his departure to Brazil, on 25 October 1635, he had explicitly authorised his subjects to recognise the then still living John the Younger as co-ruler. In 1645 John Maurice relinquished his rights to the Freudenberg district, granted by the will of 1621, in favour of his brother George Frederick. John Francis Desideratus was unsuccessful with the Emperor in Vienna, and two years later, at the Congress of Westphalia, Emperor Ferdinand III ratified the fiercely contested 1621 will of John the Middle. This left John Francis Desideratus only the Catholic third part, which is still known today as &quot;Johannland&quot;. John Maurice held both the other thirds in his hand, because his brother William had already died and left him his third part, and George Frederick had ceded all his rights to John Maurice in 1649. It was therefore the latter who continued to administer the Freudenberg district.

==Explanation of the nickname the Middle==
In the time that John the Middle lived, it was not yet customary for reigning counts to be numbered, as was the case with kings. When father and son had the same given name and the son came of age, it was necessary to distinguish both. In this case, the father was referred to as &quot;Johann der Ältere&quot; and the son as &quot;Johann der Jüngere&quot;. This is similar to the still-used custom that, when father and son bear the same given name and surname, they are distinguished by the addition of the respective abbreviations Sr. (senior) and Jr. (junior) after the surname. That John the Middle was originally called the Younger is shown in the documents found in the 1990s in the &quot;Hessisches Hauptstaatsarchiv&quot; in Wiesbaden (HHStA 171 D 1161), in which an attempt was made to record, at least from time to time, who was buried where and when in the burial vault in Dillenburg. In these documents John&#x27;s first wife is mentioned as &quot;Graf Johan des Jüngern gemahlin frau Magdalena gebohrne von Waldeck&quot; and his son, who died in 1600, as &quot;Graf Johans des Jungern söhnlein Friderich Ludwig&quot;.
But this &quot;Johann der Jüngere&quot; also had a son named John. When this son came of age, the distinction was no longer sufficient, since there were now three men from three successive generations with the same given name. The youngest was now referred to as &quot;Johann der Jüngere&quot;, and the middle one was called &quot;Johann der Mittlere&quot;. It was not until the nineteenth century that historians started to give the reigning counts a regal number. &quot;Johann der Ältere&quot; became John VI, &quot;Johann der Mittlere&quot; became John VII, and &quot;Johann der Jüngere&quot; became John VIII.

<text>.bd is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bangladesh. It is administered by the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology.

== Registrations ==
Registrations are at the third level beneath several second-level labels, paralleling the oldest gTLDs; registration is open except in the gov and mil subdomains, which are limited to authorized entities in the Bangladesh government.

Though online registration is available, currently BTCL only allows Second-level domain registration of .bd domain for only Bangladeshi citizens.

It only allows the structure of websites like - example.com.bd, example2.com.bd. example3.com.bd; but not like - example.bd, example2.bd, example3.bd.

==Top-level domains==

=== .bd ===
Though the .bd domain was introduced on 20 May 1999, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) started registering for generals in 2003.

=== .বাংলা ===
The .বাংলা (&quot;Bangla&quot;) domain was introduced in 2011. The BTCL started the process of assigning domain names for websites on 1 January 2017.

<text>Capella is a lunar impact crater in diameter that lies to the north of the Mare Nectaris, in a rugged region with many small impact craters. It was named after Roman astronomer Martianus Capella. It intrudes slightly into the eastern rim of the crater Isidorus, a feature only slightly smaller in diameter.

The wall of Capella is low but relatively thick and irregular, with a large promontory intruding on the south-eastern side. The crater is crossed by a deep rift, the Vallis Capella, which passes directly through Capella from the north rim through the southeast side of the wall, and extends out both sides for a combined distance of 110 kilometers. This feature was formed by a chain of craters. In the middle of the crater is a wide, round peak with a craterlet at the top. The western side of the crater is dotted with impact debris, forming clusters of small hills.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Capella.

<doc id="999479" wikidata="Q4748093" url="?curid=999479" title="Pussy willow">
<text>Pussy willow is a name given to many of the smaller species of the genus &quot;Salix&quot; (willows and sallows) when their furry catkins are young in early spring. These species include (among many others):
* Goat willow or goat sallow (&quot;Salix caprea&quot;), a small tree native to northern Europe and northwest Asia.
* Grey willow or grey sallow (&quot;Salix cinerea&quot;), a small tree native to northern Europe.
* American pussy willow (&quot;Salix discolor&quot;), native to northern North America.

Before the male catkins of these species come into full flower they are covered in fine, greyish fur, leading to a fancied likeness to tiny cats, also known as “pussies”. The catkins appear before the leaves, and are one of the earliest signs of spring. At other times of year trees of most of these species are usually known by their ordinary names.

==Cultural traditions==
===Asia===
The many buds of the pussy willow make it a favourite flower for Lunar New Year. The fluffy white blossoms of the pussy willow resemble silk, and they soon give forth young shoots the colour of green jade. In Chinese tradition, this represents the coming of prosperity. Towards the Lunar New Year period in spring, stalks of the plant may be bought from wet market vendors or supermarkets.

Once unbundled within one&#x27;s residence, the stalks are frequently decorated with gold and red ornaments—ornaments with colours and textures that signify prosperity and happiness. Felt pieces of red, pink, and yellow are also a common decoration in Southeast Asia.

Xie Daoyun&#x27;s comparison of snow and willow catkins is a famous line of poetry and is used to refer to precocious young female poets.

===Europe===
The flowering shoots of pussy willow are used both in Europe and America for spring religious decoration on Palm Sunday, as a replacement for palm branches, which do not grow that far north.

Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox; Ruthenian, Polish, Romanian, Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, Bavarian, and Austrian Roman Catholics; Finnish and Baltic Lutherans and Orthodox; and various other Eastern European peoples carry pussy willows on Palm Sunday instead of palm branches. This custom has continued to this day among Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Romanian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Ruthenian Catholic, Ukrainian Catholic, Kashubian Catholic and Polish Catholic émigrés to North America. Sometimes, on Palm Sunday they will bless both palms and pussy willows in church. The branches will often be preserved throughout the year in the family&#x27;s icon corner.

Pussy willow also plays a prominent role in Polish Dyngus Day (Easter Monday) observances, continued also among Polish-Americans, especially in the Buffalo, New York, area.

===Middle East===
In Greater Iran it may be part of the decoration on the Haft-Seen table during the new year celebration of Nowruz on the first day of spring, and its distilled flower is used in traditional medicine.

<text>.be is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Belgium. In November 2022, there were 1,746,459 registered domain names using it.

== History ==
The domain became active in 1989 and was administrated by Pierre Verbaeten of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. In 2000, the control of the TLD was transferred to DNS Belgium.

It was announced in November 2005 that the initial registration of domains would be free until the beginning of 2006, though with some limits on the number any individual was allowed to register. 

This was remarkably popular, with some 17,000 registrations coming in on the first day of the promotion.

== Registration ==
Any .be registration has to be ordered via a registered agent. Domain names are registered directly at second level. 

BELNET, the federal internet provider for scientific institutions, manages the codice_1 subdomain reserved for academic entities, with a policy of allowing only one active .ac.be domain per institution. 

Because of this, most universities abandoned their .ac.be SLD as primary domain. This is why &quot;ucl.ac.be&quot; shifted to &quot;uclouvain.be&quot;, &quot;fundp.ac.be&quot; to &quot;unamur.be&quot;, &quot;ulg.ac.be&quot; to &quot;uliege.be&quot; or &quot;fusl.ac.be&quot; to &quot;usaintlouis.be&quot; when changing names. 

The University of Mons-Hainaut, by merging with the Faculté polytechnique de Mons (&quot;fpms.ac.be&quot;) into a new legal entity called the University of Mons, could change its domain from &quot;umh.ac.be&quot; to &quot;umons.ac.be&quot;.

=== Regional variants ===
The Flemish separatist party Vlaams Belang introduced a draft resolution in the Parliament of the region of Flanders demanding the creation of a Flemish top level domain .vl (for , Flanders in Flemish). 

However, this resolution failed to receive support of the region&#x27;s other parties. Only recognized UN member states are eligible for a two-letter domain extension. 

In October 2008, the Flemish government expressed its intention to obtain a three-letter domain code for Flanders, like .vla, .vln or .fla. In 2014, .vlaanderen and .brussels were added, also administered by DNSBelgium.

The domain has also been in use as a logo for the federal government since 2003.

<text>Cardanus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the western part of the Moon, in the western part of the Oceanus Procellarum. Due to its location the crater appears very oval because of foreshortening, and it is viewed almost from the side.

Cardanus is distinctive for the chain of craters, designated Catena Krafft, that connect its northern rim with the crater Krafft to the north. The outer rim is sharp-edged and somewhat irregular, with a hummocky outer rampart and s along parts of the inner wall. The crater floor has several small craterlets across its surface, and it has a low ridge near the midpoint. The floor surface is somewhat irregular in the southwest, but nearly featureless elsewhere.

To the southwest is the rille designated Rima Cardanus, a cleft in the mare that generally follows a northeasterly direction. To the southeast, beyond the rille, is the small crater Galilaei. Southwest of Cardanus is Olbers.

Cardanus is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cardanus.

<doc id="999491" wikidata="Q6141454" url="?curid=999491" title="Sethi–Ullman algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Sethi–Ullman algorithm is an algorithm named after Ravi Sethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman, its inventors, for translating abstract syntax trees into machine code that uses as few registers as possible.

==Overview==
When generating code for arithmetic expressions, the compiler has to decide which is the best way to translate the expression in terms of number of instructions used as well as number of registers needed to evaluate a certain subtree. Especially in the case that free registers are scarce, the order of evaluation can be important to the length of the generated code, because different orderings may lead to larger or smaller numbers of intermediate values being spilled to memory and then restored. The Sethi–Ullman algorithm (also known as Sethi–Ullman numbering) produces code which needs the fewest instructions possible as well as the fewest storage references (under the assumption that at the most commutativity and associativity apply to the operators used, but distributive laws i.e. formula_1 do not hold). The algorithm succeeds as well if neither commutativity nor associativity hold for the expressions used, and therefore arithmetic transformations can not be applied. The algorithm also does not take advantage of common subexpressions or apply directly to expressions represented as general directed acyclic graphs rather than trees.

==Simple Sethi–Ullman algorithm==
The simple Sethi–Ullman algorithm works as follows (for a load/store architecture):

# Traverse the abstract syntax tree in pre- or postorder
## For every leaf node, if it is a non-constant left-child, assign a 1 (i.e. 1 register is needed to hold the variable/field/etc.), otherwise assign a 0 (it is a non-constant right child or constant leaf node (RHS of an operation – literals, values)).
## For every non-leaf node, if the left and right subtrees respectively need different numbers of registers &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, then assign max(&quot;l&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), otherwise assign &quot;r&quot; + 1.
# To emit code, if the subtrees need different numbers of registers, evaluate the subtree needing the most registers first (since the register needed to save the result of one subtree may make the other one spill), otherwise the order is irrelevant.

===Example===
For an arithmetic expression formula_2, the abstract syntax tree looks like this:
 / \
 a *
 / \
 / \ / \
 / \ d 3
 / \ / \
 b c f g
To continue with the algorithm, we need only to examine the arithmetic expression formula_3, i.e. we only have to look at the right subtree of the assignment &#x27;=&#x27;:
 / \
 + +
 / \ d 3
 / \ / \
 b c f g
Now we start traversing the tree (in preorder for now), assigning the number of registers needed to evaluate each subtree (note that the last summand in the expression formula_3 is a constant):

 *2
 / \
 +2 +1
 / \ d1 30
 +1 *1
 b1 c0f1 g0
From this tree it can be seen that we need 2 registers to compute the left subtree of the &#x27;*&#x27;, but only 1 register to compute the right subtree. Nodes &#x27;c&#x27; and &#x27;g&#x27; do not need registers for the following reasons: If T is a tree leaf, then the number of registers to evaluate T is either 1 or 0 depending whether T is a left or a right subtree (since an operation such as add R1, A can handle the right component A directly without storing it into a register). Therefore we shall start to emit code for the left subtree first, because we might run into the situation that we only have 2 registers left to compute the whole expression. If we now computed the right subtree first (which needs only 1 register), we would then need a register to hold the result of the right subtree while computing the left subtree (which would still need 2 registers), therefore needing 3 registers concurrently. Computing the left subtree first needs 2 registers, but the result can be stored in 1, and since the right subtree needs only 1 register to compute, the evaluation of the expression can do with only 2 registers left.

==Advanced Sethi–Ullman algorithm==
In an advanced version of the Sethi–Ullman algorithm, the arithmetic expressions are first transformed, exploiting the algebraic properties of the operators used.

<text>Cavalerius is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies on the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum lunar mare on the west part of the visible Moon. It nearly joins the northern rim of Hevelius to the south.

The rim of Cavalerius is relatively high, rising to over 3 kilometers in places. There are clefts in the northern and southern parts of the rim and inner walls. Parts of the inner sides are . The interior floor has mixed low hills and level areas. In the midpoint of the crater floor is a low central peak, with neighboring ridges to the north and east.

Northeast of this crater is the site designated Planitia Descensus, the landing site of the Soviet Luna 9 probe, the first vehicle to soft-land on the Moon. It lies among some low ridges along the edge of the Oceanus Procellarum.

<text>.bh is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bahrain. It is administered by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Bahrain (TRA).

==History==

The .bh domain was first delegated in 1994 to the University of Bahrain Computer Center. In 1999, the domain was delegated to the Bahrain Telecommunications Company, which since remains the sponsoring organisation.

In 2002, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority was established, and in 2008, the Minister of Telecommunications of Bahrain assigned TRA as the governmental agency responsible for the management of the .bh top-level domain.

On 6 December 2011, the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority commenced a request to ICANN for redelegation of the “.BH” top-level domain. In March 2012, this request was completed.

==Structure==
Registration directly at second level is available internationally, while all registrations under the second level domain names listed below, require a local presence and relevant local licences.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Central Team was formed in 1977 when activists from Punjab, Maharashtra and West Bengal of Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (CPI(ML)) of Satyanaryan Singh revolted against the party leadership. CPI(ML) Central Team reaffirmed the legacy of Charu Majumdar.

The principal strength of the party was in Punjab. In Punjab the new party started publishing &quot;Surkh Rekha&quot;. The party built up the Punjab Kisan Union, and led struggles particularly in the Jalandhar and &quot;Ludhiana&quot; districts.

During the Khalistani days, the Punjab unit developed cooperation with one splinter group of the Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist–Leninist) (UCCRI(ML)) within the Front against Repression and Communalism. This experience attracted the group to a mass line. In 1994 the Punjab branch of CPI(ML) Central Team unified with Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India, Communist Unity Centre of India and Marxist–Leninist Organising Centre to form the Communist Party Reorganization Centre of India (Marxist–Leninist). &quot;Surkh Rekha&quot; became the publication of CPRCI(ML).

The Maharashtra and West Bengal branches maintained themselves as CPI(ML) Central Team. Ahead of the 1999 Lok Sabha elections CPI(ML) Central Team signed a boycott call together with CPI(ML) People&#x27;s War and the Revolutionary Communist Centre of India (Maoist).

<text>The Museum of Science &amp; Industry (MOSI) is a non-profit science museum located in Tampa, Florida.

MOSI&#x27;s funding is provided from private donations, corporate sponsors, and support from Hillsborough County and the City of Tampa.

==History==
MOSI began in 1962 when Hillsborough County first approved funding for a youth museum in Sulphur Springs. Named the Museum of Science and Natural History, it provided natural science exhibits and education programs to children and adults. The name of the museum was changed to the Hillsborough County Museum in 1967. In 1976, the Hillsborough County Museum&#x27;s advisory committee and staff started construction on a new museum in North Tampa that was to become the Museum of Science &amp; Industry. The museum was completed in 1980 and permanently opened to the public on January 23, 1982. 
In 1995 the construction of the 190,000 square foot science center with Florida&#x27;s only IMAX Dome Theatre, extensive permanent and temporary exhibition galleries, a planetarium and a public library was completed. Further renovations were done in 1996, 2001, and 2005. MOSI was the largest science center in the southeast and the 5th largest in the U.S.

On August 13, 2017, MOSI closed 85% of their building and their IMAX theater to save money. Many exhibits were removed and the remaining exhibits were relocated to the previous &quot;Kids in Charge&quot; section of the museum.

In 2022 it was announced that there were talks about building a new facility in downtown Tampa, but those plans were scrapped due to financial concerns. Instead, MOSI will focus on expanding its current location in North Tampa and adding new exhibits and programs.

==Accreditation==
The Museum of Science &amp; Industry was re-accredited in April 2008 by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). MOSI was the 2009 recipient of the National Medal for Museums for the Institute of Museums and Library Services, which is the highest national award given to museums.

==Educational Programs and Camps==
MOSI offers S.T.E.A.M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) programs for preschool through high school students. MOSI&#x27;s camps are open when school is out of session, including summer educational camps. These camps cover various scientific topics such as snorkeling in a natural spring, using DNA to solve crimes, and video game design. Attendees will receive a S.T.E.A.M Certificate of Achievement after completing the courses.

==Community engagement==

===Hispanic Scientist of the Year Award===
Catering to the large, diverse community of Tampa Bay (and Florida at large), MOSI recognizes Hispanic Scientists through an annual award. The scientists attend Meet the Scientists Days, and they speak to children about their paths to the STEM fields. The Hispanic Scientist of the Year Award has been awarded since 2001.

===Conservation===
MOSI encouraged environmental conservation through exhibits, from water conservation to Florida-friendly gardens that were closed during the museum downsizing.

== Current exhibits ==

=== Mission: Moonbase ===
Mission: Moonbase is a simulated permanent lunar base in the year 2070. The premise is that it is built near the south pole of the Moon where there is believed to be large reservoirs of frozen water reasonably available within the rocks, and where some highlands can experience long periods of sunlight. Moonbase is the operations center of a larger operation that also includes food production (farming) and mining facilities. Mission: Moonbase at MOSI is funded, in part, by NASA and is part of MOSI&#x27;s plan to continually improve our guest experience and support the future of STEAM.

===Slippery Science===
Slippery Science, contains multiple exhibits that incorporate elements of the Tampa Bay Times Forum and Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team as a backdrop. Slippery Science includes a series of interactive exhibits that teach friction, physics, the science behind reaction time and more.

===Wooden Wonders of the World===
Wooden Wonders of the World is a temporary art installation exhibit featuring model sculptures of famous buildings hand made out of toothpicks. It will no longer be available after May 29, 2023. 
===Dinovations Lab===
Dinovations Lab is a Jurassic-themed exhibit about paleontology. It includes PaleoLab investigations, crawl-through challenges, dino-themed animation in Fossil Films, and an opportunity to touch actual dino poop.

===Saunders Planetarium===
The Saunders Planetarium was established in 1992 and is currently the only planetarium in Tampa. Thanks to a gift by the Saunders Foundation and construction by the R.R. Simmons Construction Corporation, the Planetarium opened its doors on October 3, 1992. In July 2009, the planetarium moved to a new location in Kids In Charge! Since then, nearly 700,000 people have seen its shows.

==Former exhibits==

=== Gulf Coast Hurricane ===

The hurricane exhibit at MOSI allows people to experience winds that range from a harmless rain storm to a category one hurricane. This exhibit is designed to raise awareness of the intensity of a storm. The museum refers to it as a &quot;Get Smart, Get Ready&quot; opportunity to enlighten people on how to do just that, learn and prepare for a storm. As the wind increases, a wall chart indicates the Beaufort Wind Scale and what could be expected of the winds that are being experienced. Each wind increment is tagged with an event (i.e. you cannot hold an umbrella at a wind speed of twenty-five miles per hour).

The wind is generated above the room then brought down through vents and fans using recycled air. The maximum sustained winds top at a category one hurricane, or .

===Bio-Works Butterfly Garden===

The Bio-Works Butterfly Garden and Alternate Waste Treatment exhibit was added to the Museum of Science and Industry in 1996. The exhibit consists of a butterfly garden and a self-sustaining fish pond. The garden is home to over 30 species of butterflies and several aquatic species, most of which are native to Florida. Several thousand native Florida butterflies are raised each year in a publicly viewable laboratory. These butterflies include the zebra longwing - Florida state butterfly, and the giant swallowtail and the tiger swallowtail - two of the largest North American butterflies.
The pond and large white tanks in front of the garden are part of a model wastewater treatment facility designed to purify wastewater in a simulated wetland environment. Waste water is fed through pumps into a series of underground anaerobic and aerobic purification tanks where waste particles are broken down by bacteria. The water is then pumped into a series of above ground aerobic tanks and then into a settling tank, called the clarifier, which settles remaining solids out of the water for further processing. The clean water is then chlorinated to remove remaining bacteria and then dechlorinated to remove chemicals that will be harmful to plant and animal life. Finally, the clean water is pumped back into a fish pond and the cycle continues. Of the fish in the pond, the tilapia are the most unusual. The tilapia are the third, fourth and fifth generations of descendants of the first fish born in space. This fish, named Amigo, was born on John Glenn&#x27;s last space mission, STS-95, and was returned to earth so that its reproduction could be observed.

===The Amazing You!===
MetLife Foundation&#x27;s Amazing You! is a exhibition about health and wellness at each developmental life stage. The exhibit informs about developmental milestones, what it takes to stay healthy at each stage, and how to return to wellness after an illness, surgery or a disability. It features medical conditions and diseases according to prevalence during each developmental stage of life.

The first phase of this permanent exhibition is located in MOSI&#x27;s third floor exhibit gallery. The first phase focuses on the beginning of life to adolescence life stages. The second phase is located next to the first phase. The second phase focuses on the young adult to end of life stages.

===WeatherQuest Sponsored by Bay News 9===

Bay News 9 Project Weather Weather Quest is an exhibit within Disasterville at the Museum of Science and Industry. The permanent exhibit features a Bay News 9 news desk and meteorologist green screen. This exhibit features . of interactive exhibits on the science of natural disasters, how it affects lives and property, and what can be done to minimize property damage and loss of life. The exhibition covers nine disaster genres: floods, hail storms, hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, wildfires, volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis.

<doc id="999502" wikidata="Q1809674" url="?curid=999502" title="Granny (Looney Tunes)">
<text>Granny, whose full name is presented as Emma Webster, is a fictional character created by Friz Freleng, best known from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated short films of the 1950s and 1960s. She is the owner of Tweety Bird and, more often than not, Sylvester and Hector. Her voice was first provided by Bea Benaderet from 1950 through 1955, then by June Foray for almost 60 years. Following Foray&#x27;s death, Candi Milo took over in 2017.

==Biography==
Granny is a good-natured widow who is extremely protective of her beloved bird, Tweety. Granny&#x27;s overprotectiveness becomes apparent whenever Tweety is threatened, usually by her sometimes pet, Sylvester. Although having the appearance of a kind old woman, Granny has demonstrated her cleverness in many cartoons.

At least until the mid-1950s, Granny is depicted as an elderly spinster who wears spectacles, a gray bun and a late 19th-century-like schoolmarm dress; other old fashioned characteristics include her mode of transportation (usually, a Ford Model T or a horse and buggy) and her inability to relate to present fads (such as her telling Tweety she&#x27;s about to try on a new &quot;bikini bathing suit&quot;, which turns out to be a full one-piece outfit from the turn-of-the-20th century). After 1955 — in particular, the years after Foray began voicing the character — the character&#x27;s wardrobe was updated and her old-fashioned tastes and ways of life were de-emphasized, and she was sometimes given newer careers, such as a nurse or a bus driver.

==Appearances==
The idea of the cartoon Granny began with the &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; character in spoofs of the story, first appearing as such in the 1937 animated short &quot;Little Red Walking Hood&quot; which also featured the first appearance of Elmer Fudd, directed by Tex Avery. Subsequent appearances of a similar &quot;granny&quot; character included &quot;The Cagey Canary&quot; (1941), directed by Avery and Bob Clampett; &quot;Hiss and Make Up&quot; (1943), directed by Friz Freleng; and &quot;Hare Force&quot; (1944), featuring Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the dog (a one-off character distinct from the later Sylvester the cat). Finally, the character was solidified into her current role in &quot;Canary Row&quot; in 1950, with Bea Benaderet providing her voice. June Foray, who had been providing Granny&#x27;s voice for her appearances on Capitol Records since 1950, took over the role officially in 1955, and would perform the role for most of the rest of the character&#x27;s theatrical run. Granny would continue to appear in several more animated shorts from the 1950s on, as a foil for Sylvester, who was always attempting to eat her pet bird Tweety.

Foray did not voice Granny for her last two theatrical shorts, possibly for budgetary reasons; Ge Ge Pearson and Joan Gerber each voiced the character in one short, both of which were released in 1965. Foray would return to the role in later television productions.

===Solo===
Although she was almost always shown on-screen with at least one of her two animal companions, Granny would appear in three animated shorts without them. In the 1953 short &quot;Hare Trimmed&quot;, she starred as a rich widow who was being fought over by two suitors, Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny (the latter out to thwart the former&#x27;s evil plan to marry her and then get her money). Sam called her &quot;Emma&quot; and later &quot;Emmy&quot;. Granny would later appear in the 1955&#x27;s short &quot;This Is a Life?&quot;, where she hits Daffy Duck with her umbrella for interrupting the live program. Her last solo appearance was the 1965 short &quot;Corn on the Cop&quot;, where she appears alongside Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as two Keystone Cops who mistake her for a crook disguised like her. The short would also disclose Granny&#x27;s surname as &quot;Webster&quot; by Daffy and Porky&#x27;s superior officer.

===Later appearances===
Granny was going to have a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but was later dropped for unknown reasons.

She has appeared as a professor at Acme Looniversity and the mentor and favorite teacher of Mary Melody in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (in the reboot series &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, she appears as the university&#x27;s dean), a world-traveling detective in &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;, and a timekeeper in &quot;Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters&quot;. Granny donned cheerleader uniform for the Tune Squad in the film &quot;Space Jam&quot;. She was the children&#x27;s grandmother and new character Floyd&#x27;s aunt in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, and made two cameo appearance in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; as the main character&#x27;s next door neighbor, although in one of those appearances this &quot;Granny&quot; was actually the Acme Chairman in disguise. She also appeared in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot; and in &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot;.

An episode of &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; featured characters named Queen Grannicus (voiced by Candi Milo), the Royal Tweetums and Sylth Vester (the latter being a parody of Darth Vader). However, another episode features a cameo of Granny herself, apparently still alive in the year 2772.

In &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, Granny is one of Bugs and Daffy&#x27;s neighbors and is voiced again by Foray while her younger self is voiced by Stephanie Courtney, and Sylvester and Tweety are her pets. This version of Granny seems to be somewhat hard-of-hearing and slightly senile. A running gag is that Sylvester is constantly chasing Tweety around her house, to which Granny seems oblivious. In &quot;Eligible Bachelors&quot;, it is revealed that during World War II, Granny/Emma was a member of the WAC and along with Tweety she stopped Nazi Colonel Frankenheimer from stealing the Eiffel Tower and various paintings from the Louvre. During the flashback of her World War II adventure to Daffy, she appears as an attractive red-headed young woman in a WAC uniform. In &quot;The Grand Old Duck of York&quot;, it is revealed that Granny teaches piano lessons when Daffy wants to learn how to play the piano.

Granny appears in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; voiced by Candi Milo.

Granny appears in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; voiced by Candi Milo. After she and Speedy Gonzales were picked up from &quot;The Matrix&quot; part of the Warner Bros. 3000 server-verse, Granny became a member of the Tune Squad during their basketball match against the Goon Squad. In one scene, she defeats Chronos by activating the time-control device on his left shoulder to age him to 132 years. During the credits, a photograph shows Granny going up against Ronda Rousey.

Granny appears as a major character in the 2022 film &quot;King Tweety&quot;.

<text>Cavendish is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon, to the southwest of the larger crater Mersenius. It lies between the smaller craters Henry to the west-northwest and de Gasparis to the east-southeast.

The rim of Cavendish is heavily worn and the crater Cavendish E lies across the southwest rim. The smaller Cavendish A is intruding into the northeast rim. On the flood are a pair of low-rimmed craters that are joined at the rims and span most of the central Cavendish crater floor from east to west.

A rille from the Rimae de Gasparis reaches the eastern rim of Cavendish.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cavendish.

<text>de Gasparis is a lunar crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon. It lies to the southeast of the crater Cavendish and south of Mersenius.

The rim of de Gasparis is worn and eroded, and the interior has been flooded by basaltic lava. The surviving outer rim reaches a maximum altitude of about 0.8 km.

This crater is notable for the formation of rilles that criss-cross the floor and the surrounding surface. This system of clefts in the surface is designated Rimae de Gasparis, and they span an area of about 130 kilometers in diameter. The rilles are thought to have been created due to tectonic faults deep below the surface. As they cut across de Gasparis, this indicates that they were formed after the crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to de Gasparis.

<doc id="999515" wikidata="Q6203021" url="?curid=999515" title="Jirel of Joiry">
<text>Jirel of Joiry is a fictional character created by American writer C. L. Moore, who appeared in a series of sword and sorcery stories published first in the pulp horror/fantasy magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Jirel is the proud, tough, arrogant and beautiful ruler of her own domain, Joiry; somewhere in late medieval France. One Jirel story, &quot;Quest of the Starstone&quot;, states the time period that the story is set in as the year 1500 CE. Her adventures continually involve her in dangerous brushes with the supernatural.

These stories are among the first to show the influence of Robert E. Howard on sword and sorcery; they also introduced a female protagonist to the genre.

== Stories and collections ==
Moore&#x27;s Jirel stories include the following:

* &quot;Black God&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (October 1934)
* &quot;Black God&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (December 1934)
* &quot;Jirel Meets Magic&quot; (July 1935)
* &quot;The Dark Land&quot; (January 1936)
* &quot;Quest of the Starstone&quot; (November 1937), with Henry Kuttner
* &quot;Hellsgarde&quot; (April 1939)

These stories, except for &quot;Quest of the Starstone&quot;, appear in the collection &quot;Jirel of Joiry&quot; (1969), and in the Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks compendium &quot;Black Gods and Scarlet Dreams&quot; (2002). All six appear in a collected edition under Paizo Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Planet Stories&quot; imprint, compiled under the title &quot;Black God&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

In 2024, &quot;Jirel and the Mirror of Truth&quot;, a new Jirel story by Molly Tanzer, appeared in the third issue of the magazine &quot;New Edge Sword and Sorcery&quot;. The story was written with the permission of Moore&#x27;s estate.

== Reception ==
She has been described as one of the first strong female characters in the fantasy genre, and &quot;the world&#x27;s first female sword-and-sorcery hero&quot;.

Despite being a female character, her masculine traits have led to her being analyzed in the context of gender bending fiction.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Jirel of Joiry&quot;, a 1985 filk song by Mercedes Lackey and Leslie Fish, appears on the album &quot;Murder, Mystery and Mayhem.&quot;

<text>Gustav Anton Zeuner (30 November 1828 – 17 October 1907) was a German physicist, engineer and epistemologist, considered the founder of technical thermodynamics and of the Dresden School of Thermodynamics.

==Life==

===University and Revolution===
Zeuner was born in Chemnitz, Saxony. His first training in the subject of engineering was at the Chemnitz &quot;Königliche Gewerbeschule&quot; (Royal Vocational School), today Chemnitz University of Technology, where he studied from 1843-1848.

In 1848 he moved the short distance to the &quot;Bergakademie&quot; (Mining Academy) in Freiberg, today also a university of technology, where he studied mining and metallurgy. He developed close links with one of his professors, the famous mineralogist Albin Julius Weisbach, with whom he worked on several projects.

The university course was disrupted, however, during the revolutions which took place all over Germany. Large popular assemblies and mass demonstrations took place, primarily demanding freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, arming of the people, and a national German parliament. Zeuner joined the revolutionaries on the barricades in Dresden during the May Uprising in 1849. Unlike many of his compatriots, some of whom were sentenced to death or sent to the workhouse, Zeuner was pardoned. He was able to complete his course, and even completed his PhD at the University of Leipzig in 1853, but was banned from ever teaching at any Saxon university.

===Escape to Zürich===

In 1853, Zeuner took over as the editor of the engineering magazine &quot;Der Civilenginieur. Zeitschrift für das Ingenieurwesen&quot;, the first German magazine specialising in mechanics, which ran until 1896. He continued in this position until 1857, even after moving to Zürich in 1855 to work as a professor for technical mechanics at the ETH Zürich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. There he worked alongside famous engineers such as Franz Reuleaux. Other Dresden revolutionaries had fled their home country for Zürich (Richard Wagner, Gottfried Semper, Theodor Mommsen).

It was in Zürich that Zeuner made his model of a locomotive front end in 1858; he recognised its potential for creating momentum but was only interested in the theory and did not develop the design any further. Also in Zürich (in 1869) Zeuner invented the three-dimensional population graph now sometimes known as a Zeuner diagram but more often as a Lexis diagram after Wilhelm Lexis who modified the idea slightly.

From 1859 Zeuner worked the stand-in director of the ETH Zürich, and in May 1865 he took over the position officially. His former professor, Albin Weisbach, commemorated his friend&#x27;s acquisition of the post by naming a mineral after him - the transparent green crystal zeunerite.

===Return to Germany===

In 1871 Zeuner returned to Germany and was once again able to work with Weisbach when he succeeded his old friend as director of the Freiberg Mining Academy. He also taught there until 1875 as a professor of mechanics and the study of mining machinery. This was now possible, despite the teaching ban which had been placed on him, because of the amnesty granted to all the revolutionaries in 1862.

In 1873, while still director of Freiberg Mining Academy, Zeuner also took on the post of director at the Royal Saxon Polytechnicum in Dresden (now Technische Universität Dresden). Zeuner&#x27;s efforts there led to the introduction of the humanities; the extension of the range of subjects taught resulted in the polytechnic&#x27;s rise to a full-scale polytechnic university in 1890.

In 1889, aged 61, Zeuner gave up his position as director of the polytechnic to work as a lecturer until his retirement in 1897. On retiring he was made an emeritus professor. Zeuner died in Dresden in 1907.

==Gustav Zeuner Award==
Since 1993, the German Association of Engineers (&quot;Verein Deutscher Ingenieure&quot; or VDI) has presented students with the Gustav Zeuner Award for the best engineering thesis in Germany; Zeuner supported the Dresden branch of the VDI at its foundation in 1897.

<text>Delisle is a small lunar impact crater in the western part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. It lies to the north of the crater Diophantus, and just to the northwest of the ridge designated Mons Delisle. Between Delisle and Diophantus is a sinuous rille named Rima Diophantus, with a diameter of 150 km. To the northeast is another rille designated Rima Delisle, named after this crater.

The rim of Delisle is somewhat polygonal in form and it has a low central rise on the floor. There is some slight slumping along the inner wall, but overall the rim is still relatively fresh with little appearance of significant wear. The outer rim is surrounded by a small rampart of hummocky terrain.

Delisle is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

This formation has also been designated &quot;De l&#x27;Isle&quot; in some sources.

==Rima Delisle==
This is a sinuous rille centered on selenographic coordinates 31.0° N, 32.0° W. It occupies a maximum diameter of 60 km. Three tiny craters in the vicinity of this feature have been assigned names by the IAU. These are listed in the table below.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Delisle.

<text>Descartes is a heavily worn lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. To the southwest is the crater Abulfeda. It is named after the French philosopher, mathematician and physicist René Descartes.

The rim of Descartes survives only in stretches, and is completely missing in the north. The crater Descartes A lies across the southwest rim. The interior floor contains several curved ridges. These are concentric with the surviving outer walls to the northwest and southeast.

A section of the outer rim of Descartes is covered by a region that has a higher albedo than the surrounding surface. Low-altitude measurements by the Lunar Prospector showed that this patch is actually a magnetic anomaly—the strongest on the near side of the Moon. This magnetic field may be deflecting particles from the solar wind, and thus preventing the underlying surface from growing darker because of space weathering. This is similar to the process causing Reiner Gamma and other bright swirls such as those of Mare Marginis and Mare Ingenii.

About 50 kilometers to the north of this crater was the landing site of Apollo 16. The uneven region about the landing area is sometimes called the Descartes Highlands or the Descartes Mountains.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Descartes.

<text>Product design is the process of creating new products for businesses to sell to their customers. It involves the generation and development of ideas through a systematic process that leads to the creation of innovative products. Thus, it is a major aspect of new product development.

&quot;Product Design Process:&quot; 

The product design process is a set of strategic and tactical activities, from idea generation to commercialization, used to create a product design. In a systematic approach, product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas, turning them into tangible inventions and products. The product designer&#x27;s role is to combine art, science, and technology to create new products that people can use. Their evolving role has been facilitated by digital tools that now allow designers to do things that include communicate, visualize, analyze, 3D modeling and actually produce tangible ideas in a way that would have taken greater human resources in the past.

Product design is sometimes confused with (and certainly overlaps with) industrial design, and has recently become a broad term inclusive of service, software, and physical product design. Industrial design is concerned with bringing artistic form and usability, usually associated with craft design and ergonomics, together in order to mass-produce goods. Other aspects of product design and industrial design include engineering design, particularly when matters of functionality or utility (e.g. problem-solving) are at issue, though such boundaries are not always clear.

==Product design process==
There are various product design processes and many focus on different aspects. One example formulation/model of the process is described by Don Koberg and Jim Bagnel in &quot;The Seven Universal Stages of Creative Problem-Solving.&quot; The process is usually completed by a group of people with different skills and training—e.g. industrial designers, field experts (prospective users), engineers (for engineering design aspects), depending upon the nature and type of the product involved. The process often involves figuring out what is required, brainstorming possible ideas, creating mock prototypes and then generating the product. However, that is not the end. Product designers would still need to execute the idea, making it into an actual product and evaluating its success (seeing if any improvements are necessary).

The product design process has experienced huge leaps in evolution over the last few years with the rise and adoption of 3D printing. New consumer-friendly 3D printers can produce dimensional objects and print upwards with a plastic like substance opposed to traditional printers that spread ink across a page.

The product design process, as expressed by Koberg and Bagnell, typically involves three main aspects:
*Analysis
*Concept
*Synthesis

Depending on the kind of product being designed, the latter two sections are most often revisited (e.g. depending on how often the design needs revision, to improve it or to better fit the criteria). This is a continuous loop, where feedback is the main component. Koberg and Bagnell offer more specifics on the process: In their model, &quot;analysis&quot; consists of two stages, &quot;concept&quot; is only one stage, and &quot;synthesis&quot; encompasses the other four. (These terms notably vary in usage in different design frameworks. Here, they are used in the way they&#x27;re used by Koberg and Bagnell.)

===Analysis===
*Accept Situation: Here, the designers decide on committing to the project and finding a solution to the problem. They pool their resources into figuring out how to solve the task most efficiently.
*Analyze: In this stage, everyone in the team begins research. They gather general and specific materials which will help to figure out how their problem might be solved. This can range from statistics, questionnaires, and articles, among many other sources.

===Concept===
*Define: This is where the key issue of the matter is defined. The conditions of the problem become objectives, and restraints on the situation become the parameters within which the new design must be constructed.

===Synthesis===
*Ideate: The designers here brainstorm different ideas, solutions for their design problem. The ideal brainstorming session does not involve any bias or judgment, but instead builds on original ideas.
*Select: By now, the designers have narrowed down their ideas to a select few, which can be guaranteed successes and from there they can outline their plan to make the product.
*Implement: This is where the prototypes are built, the plan outlined in the previous step is realized and the product starts to become an actual object.
*Evaluate: In the last stage, the product is tested, and from there, improvements are made. Although this is the last stage, it does not mean that the process is over. The finished prototype may not work as well as hoped so new ideas need to be brainstormed.

== Double Diamond Framework ==
The Double Diamond Framework is a widely used approach for product discovery, which emphasizes a structured method for problem-solving and solution development, encouraging teams to diverge (broad exploration) before converging (focused decision-making).

The framework is divided into two primary stages: diverging and converging, each with its own steps and considerations.

Diverging Stage:

During the diverging stage, teams explore the problem space broadly without predefined solutions. This phase involves engaging with core personas, conducting open-ended conversations, and gathering unfiltered input from customer-facing teams. The goal is to identify and document various problem areas, allowing themes and key issues to emerge naturally.

Converging Stage:

As insights emerge, teams transition to the converging stage, where they narrow down problem areas and prioritize solutions. This phase involves defining the problem, understanding major pain points, and advocating for solutions within the organization. Effective convergence requires clear articulation of the problem&#x27;s significance and consideration of business strategies and feasibility.

Iterative Process:

The Double Diamond Framework is iterative, allowing teams to revisit stages as needed based on feedback and outcomes. Moving back to earlier stages may be necessary if solutions fail to address underlying issues or elicit negative user responses. Success lies in the team&#x27;s ability to adapt and refine their approach over time.

==Creative visualization==
In design, Creative Visualization refers to the process by which computer generated imagery, digital animation, three-dimensional models, and two-dimensional representations, such as architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, and sewing patterns are created and used in order to visualize a potential product prior to production. Such products include prototypes for vehicles in automotive engineering, apparel in the fashion industry, and buildings in architectural design.

==Demand-pull innovation and invention-push innovation==
Most product designs fall under one of two categories: demand-pull innovation or invention-push innovation.

Demand-pull happens when there is an opportunity in the market to be explored by the design of a product. This product design attempts to solve a design problem. The design solution may be the development of a new product or developing a product that&#x27;s already on the market, such as developing an existing invention for another purpose.

Invention-push innovation happens when there is an advancement in intelligence. This can occur through research or it can occur when the product designer comes up with a new product design idea.

==Product design expression==

Design expression comes from the combined effect of all elements in a product. Colour tone, shape and size should direct a person&#x27;s thoughts towards buying the product. Therefore, it is in the product designer&#x27;s best interest to consider the audiences who are most likely to be the product&#x27;s end consumers. Keeping in mind how consumers will perceive the product during the design process will direct towards the product’s success in the market. However, even within a specific audience, it is challenging to cater to each possible personality within that group.

One solution to that is to create a product that, in its designed appearance and function, expresses a personality or tells a story. Products that carry such attributes are more likely to give off a stronger expression that will attract more consumers. On that note it is important to keep in mind that design expression does not only concern the appearance of a product, but also its function. For example, as humans our appearance as well as our actions are subject to people&#x27;s judgment when they are making a first impression of us. People usually do not appreciate a rude person even if they are good looking. Similarly, a product can have an attractive appearance but if its function does not follow through it will most likely drop in regards to consumer interest. In this sense, designers are like communicators, they use the language of different elements in the product to express something.

==Trends in product design==
Product designers must consider every detail: how people use and misuse objects, potential flaws in products, errors in the design process, and the ideal ways people wish they could interact with those objects. Many new designs will fail and many won&#x27;t even make it to market. Some designs eventually become obsolete. The design process itself can be quite frustrating usually taking 5 or 6 tries to get the product design right. A product that fails in the marketplace the first time may be re-introduced to the market 2 more times. If it continues to fail, the product is then considered to be dead because the market believes it to be a failure. Most new products fail, even if there&#x27;s a great idea behind them.

All types of product design are clearly linked to the economic health of manufacturing sectors. Innovation provides much of the competitive impetus for the development of new products, with new technology often requiring a new design interpretation. It only takes one manufacturer to create a new product paradigm to force the rest of the industry to catch up—fueling further innovation. Products designed to benefit people of all ages and abilities—without penalty to any group—accommodate our swelling aging population by extending independence and supporting the changing physical and sensory needs we all encounter as we grow older.

<doc id="999539" wikidata="Q1227005" url="?curid=999539" title="Dionysius (crater)">
<text>Dionysius is a lunar impact crater that lies on the western edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after Dionysius the Areopagite. To the southeast is the crater pair of Ritter and Sabine. Just to the northwest is the system of rilles designated Rimae Ritter. These clefts follow a generally northwest direction.

The rim of Dionysius is generally circular and shows little sign of wear. The crater possesses a small ray system with a radius of over 130 kilometers. The formation has a high albedo and appears bright when the Sun is nearly overhead during a full Moon. It is surrounded by a bright halo, with darker material farther out. Some darker deposits are in the form of relatively rare dark rays.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dionysius.

<doc id="999542" wikidata="Q17087252" url="?curid=999542" title="Independent expenditure">
<text>An independent expenditure, in elections in the United States, is a political campaign communication that expressly advocates for the election or defeat of a clearly identified political candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation or concert with – or at the request or suggestion of – a candidate, a candidate&#x27;s authorized committee, or a political party. If a candidate&#x27;s agent, authorized committee, party, or an &quot;agent&quot; for one of these groups becomes &quot;materially involved&quot;, the expenditure is not independent.

==Definition==
The Code of Federal Regulations defined independent expenditure as an expenditure for a communication &quot;expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate&#x27;s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents.&quot; 11 CFR 100.16(a). The term was first introduced in the Code of Federal Regulations in 2003.

The Federal Election Commission defines an agent as someone who has &quot;actual authority, either express or implied&quot; to perform one or more of a list of actions on behalf of a campaign. It stipulates that an otherwise independent expenditure could be invalidated if an &quot;agent&quot; does something as simple as suggesting an advertisement be made. To prevent this, some groups claim that they sequester staff months before an election.

An organization making an independent expenditure must include a federally mandated disclaimer identifying the person or organization paying for the communication and stating that the communication was not authorized by a candidate or candidate&#x27;s committee.

==As distinguished from contributions==
Contributions are money, or their equivalent, that are given to someone to use. Candidates and groups then spend the money, or their equivalent, to pay for campaigns. The phrase &quot;or their equivalent&quot; is incorporated into definitions to account for other things of value. For example, a radio station that gives free air-time so a group can run an ad is making a contribution.

==Coordinations==

=== Pre-candidacy strategies ===
In recent years, a number of candidates have sought to bypass campaign finance rules by delaying their intention to run for office, instead forming so-called &quot;exploratory committees.&quot; Exploratory committees had been in existence well before the advent of super PACs, but are now increasingly used with the explicit intention of giving candidates a head-start in their respective campaigns. Ostensibly, they&#x27;re created as a means to &quot;test the waters&quot; of that potential candidate&#x27;s electability; in reality, and today more than ever, it enables them to raise money above what is set out in the federal candidate contribution limits and restrictions (which stipulates no more than $3,300 per individual donor, and no corporate/union funds) until they&#x27;ve officially declared their candidacy. This behavior has been challenged by legal analysts, most notably by the Senior Counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, Paul S. Ryan. He asserts that prior to the 2016 Presidential Primaries, &quot;[Jeb] Bush, [Martin] O&#x27;Malley, [Rick] Santorum and [Scott] Walker [were] all raising funds above the $2,700 candidate limit, providing reason to believe they [were] violating federal law.&quot; Ryan argues, &quot;[They] have actually crossed the threshold to become &#x27;candidates&#x27; as defined in federal law, by referring to themselves publicly as candidates and/or by amassing campaign funds that will be spent after they formally declare their candidacies.&quot; Furthermore, by refraining from officially announcing their candidacies, they are essentially free to raise unlimited funds for their chosen super PAC, and both &#x27;coordinate&#x27; with and guide that super PAC in any way they see fit. This allows potential candidates-to-be to drum-up support and publicity, as well as stockpiling funds for their nominated super PAC, well in advance of whichever campaign they&#x27;re looking to contest.

=== Examples of alleged coordination ===
Some have argued that FEC regulations are regularly flouted through the use of loopholes, and that a significant amount of independent expenditure is, in reality, coordinated. A piece written by Alex Roarty and Shane Goldmacher in the National Journal, and republished in The Atlantic, outlined just how &quot;brazen&quot; current attempts at coordination can be. Focusing on Thom Tillis, a Republican US Senator from North Carolina, and his 2014 Senate campaign&#x27;s efforts to influence his allied super PAC, it details the publication of a freely-available memo on Tillis&#x27;s website, which outlined his campaign&#x27;s detailed advertising strategy. Purportedly &#x27;intended&#x27; for donors, &quot;It is just as easily read as an explicit wish list aimed at the inboxes of outside allies with whom he cannot otherwise legally communicate about strategy.&quot; Paul S. Ryan from the Campaign Legal Center noted he had &quot;never seen anything like it,&quot; but &quot;hastened to add he also saw nothing illegal in the Tillis missive.&quot; As Roarty and Goldmacher elaborate, &quot;The restrictions that bar coordination between candidates and their allies only apply to explicit communication between the two sides—a loophole that has been exploited by speaking in public ever since the proliferation of outside organizations following the Supreme Court&#x27;s Citizens United ruling.&quot;

In 2015, Jeb Bush and his dealings with his Right to Rise super PAC faced significant scrutiny due to the perception of apparent coordination. Alice Ollstein, writing for thinkprogress.org, clarifies, &quot;Buried in the most recent round of FEC filings is evidence Bush&#x27;s Right to Rise super PAC paid the firm Wisecup Consulting LLC at least $16,000 this April and May for &#x27;political strategy consulting,&#x27; while the campaign paid the same firm about $60,000 for exactly the same service — despite the two entities being legally barred from any coordination.&quot; Moreover, after suffering setbacks in the early primaries of his presidential campaign, Jeb Bush&#x27;s Right to Rise super PAC produced a television advert using his brother, former President George W. Bush, to endorse him. When queried about the commercial, Jeb Bush protested that &quot;[He] didn&#x27;t know [his brother] was doing that&quot; and was &quot;righteous in making sure there&#x27;s no coordination.&quot; Given the nature of their relationship, some have found it difficult to believe that Jeb Bush had no role or influence in recruiting his brother to make the ad, and thus, contravened campaign finance coordination rules.

Some have advocated for a rethink in campaign finance law, given the relative impunity with which candidates now act and disregard campaign finance rules. Attorney Ben W. Heineman Jr. wrote in The Atlantic that &quot;making damning facts public will be necessary to present a case&quot; that &quot;unmasks the claim&quot; of super PACs being independent of their chosen candidates. However, for the time being, it seems as though tackling coordination in any meaningful way is unlikely. Even the Chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, Ann M. Ravel, admitted, &quot;The likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim. ... I never want to give up, but I&#x27;m not under any illusions. People think the F.E.C. is dysfunctional. It&#x27;s worse than dysfunctional.&quot;

===Important Supreme Court decisions===
In 1976, the United States Supreme Court ruled on Buckley v. Valeo, a case which challenged most of the provisions in the Federal Election Campaign Act. The court upheld the law&#x27;s limits on contributions to candidates for Federal office. The Court did not, however, uphold limits on expenditures made by candidates or on independent expenditures.

In 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission that political action committees (PACs) and other groups that made independent expenditures, but not contributions to candidate committees or parties, could accept contributions without restriction as to source or size.

<text>Revolutionary Communist Centre of India (Maoist), was a communist group based in Punjab. RCCI(M) was formed in 1995, as the Revolutionary Communist Centre of India (Marxist–Leninist) was divided into two (the other faction was the Revolutionary Communist Centre of India (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist)). The secretary of RCCI(M) was Shamsher Singh Sheri.

RCCI(M) held conferences in 1996 and 2002.

RCCI(M) was a candidate member of Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM). It was also one of the founding organisations of the Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organisations of South Asia. In January 2003 RCCI(M) merged with Maoist Communist Centre, which then took the name Maoist Communist Centre of India.</text><links>

<text>Diophantus is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southwestern part of the Mare Imbrium, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus. It forms a pair with the larger crater Delisle to the north, has a wide inner wall and a low central rise. To the north of Diophantus is the sinuous rille designated Rima Diophantus, named after the crater. Diophantus C lies near the exterior of the southwest wall.

Diophantus is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Rima Diophantus==
This cleft follows a generally east–west path across the Mare Imbrium. It is centered at selenographic coordinates 31.0° N, 32.0° W, and has a maximum diameter of 150 km.

==Small craters==
Several tiny craters north of Diophantus have been assigned names by the IAU. These are listed in the table below.



The crater Samir has bright rays that extend for over 70 km.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Diophantus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

<doc id="999547" wikidata="Q1859950" url="?curid=999547" title="Rum Cay">
<text>Rum Cay (formerly known as Mamana and Santa Maria de la Concepción) is an island and district of the Bahamas. It measures in area, it is located at Lat.: N23 42&#x27; 30&quot; - Long.: W 74 50&#x27; 00&quot;. It has many rolling hills that rise to about 120 feet (37 m).

The island is believed to have acquired its modern name from a shipwrecked cargo of rum. The main settlement is Port Nelson. Its population was recorded as 90 . Before 1996 the island was part of a combined district of San Salvador and Rum Cay.

==Location==

Rum Cay is 20 miles (32 km) southwest of San Salvador Island.

==History==

===Aboriginals===

Rum Cay was called &quot;Mamana&quot; (or &quot;Manigua&quot;), meaning &quot;mid waters land&quot;, by the native Lucayans. In the north there is a cave containing Lucayan drawings and carvings. Various artifacts from the Arawak period have been found by farmers in the fertile soil, which the natives enriched with bat guano.

===Spanish===
Some writers, such as Samuel Eliot Morison, identified Rum Cay as the site of one of Christopher Columbus&#x27; landfalls during his 1492 voyage, as the island Columbus called &quot;Santa María de la Concepción&quot;. However, a variety of other historians, geographers, and other writers identify the island as corresponding to different islands in the Bahamas or Caicos.

===Loyalists===
Plantation boundaries known as ‘margins’ can be seen all over the island, which date from the beginning of the 19th century when Loyalists settled here.

===Today===
Tourism has traditionally been the main source of employment. Nearly everybody lives in Port Nelson where cottages can be rented.

==Places of interest==
Deep reefs and drop-offs surround this former pirates’ haven. There is staghorn coral at Summer Point Reef and diving at Pinder’s Point. At the Grand Canyon, 60-foot coral walls almost reach the surface. Sumner Point Marina has dockage, fuel, moorings, WiFi, bar and restaurant. As of summer 2013, this marina is closed, and has only dockage available but absolutely no services.

=== HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; ===

The wreck of the 101-gun man of war HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot;, built in Devon in 1855 and which served in the Crimean War, lies in 30 feet of water off Rum Cay. She was lost on Sumner Point Reef, Rum Cay, on December 13, 1861. All 1,400 aboard survived. The wreck is preserved as the Underwater Museum of the Bahamas. It is the property of The Bahamas Government and none of the contents of the ship may be removed.

:&quot;She was 20 nm out in estimating her position and, after making her landfall, cut rounding the southeast point of Rum Cay too fine and went hard on the reef. Her captain, fearing that his crew (most of whom could not swim in those days) would drink themselves insensible when it became obvious the ship was lost, ordered all ale, wine, and spirit casks to be broken and their contents ditched. He then sent the two largest ship’s company unloaded everything they could salvage, and set about making a camp on the island. The captain remained on board with one midshipman and ten seamen until the ship broke up. Then all of them, less the boat parties, were marooned on Rum Cay. They were rescued soon after the news of the disaster was known.&quot;

==Transportation==
The island is served by Port Nelson Airport.

<doc id="999549" wikidata="Q5973386" url="?curid=999549" title="IRA Army Council">
<text>The IRA Army Council was the decision-making body of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, a paramilitary group dedicated to bringing about independence to the whole island of Ireland and the end of the Union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The Council had seven members, said by the British and Irish governments to have included Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn Féin. The Independent Monitoring Commission declared in 2008 that the council was &quot;no longer operational or functional,&quot; but that it had not dissolved.

==Background==
=== Origins ===
The Army Council of the IRA split in December 1969 and a &quot;Provisional&quot; Army Council emerged as the head of the newly formed Provisional Irish Republican Army.

=== Legal status ===
The IRA was a proscribed organization under the terms of the Offences Against the State Acts passed between 1939 and 1998 in the Republic of Ireland and under equivalent anti-terrorist legislation in the United Kingdom, making membership of it a criminal offence. In the Republic, trials for membership take place in the Special Criminal Court (where three judges hear cases without a jury, on the evidence of a Garda superintendent or higher rank) and carries a maximum penalty of five years&#x27; imprisonment.

===Relationship with Sinn Féin===
Senior members of Sinn Féin have been alleged to sit on the Army Council. On 20 February 2005 during a radio interview, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell publicly named Martin Ferris, Gerry Adams, and Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin&#x27;s chief negotiator, as members of the Army Council. The three men issued a statement the next day denying the charge.

On 27 July 2005, McDowell expressed his belief that Adams, McGuinness, and Ferris had recently (within the previous few days) left the IRA Army Council. However he also claimed that it was his opinion that this by itself did not necessarily amount to a permanent split between the two organisations.

On 20 October 2015, the Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, commissioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the structure, role and purpose of paramilitary organisations reported that the structures of the IRA remain in existence &quot;in a much reduced form&quot;, including &quot;a senior leadership, the &#x27;Provisional Army Council&#x27; and some &#x27;departments&#x27;&quot;, but that they are not recruiting members. It concluded that the IRA still has access to some weapons, but have not sought to procure more since at least 2011. It also said that IRA members believe the Army Council oversees both the IRA and Sinn Féin.

==Membership==
In May 2005, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the following changes were made to the IRA Army Council:
*Bernard Fox replaced Brian Keenan
*Brian Arthurs and Sean Murray were named as possible replacements for Gerry Adams
*Martin Lynch replaced Martin McGuinness
*Martin Ferris was also reported to have stepped down

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported in July 2005 that security sources believed that the current Army Council consisted of:
*Thomas Murphy, chief of staff
*Brian Arthurs, Commander, Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade
*Bernard Fox, a former hunger striker (on 24 September 2006, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Fox had resigned from the Army Council)
*Sean Murray, from Belfast, OC of Northern Command
*Martin Lynch, Adjutant-general, an Adams supporter from Belfast
*Brian Gillen, from Belfast
*A Dublin man who was not named for legal reasons

<text>Doppelmayer is the remains of a lunar impact crater that lies on the southwest edge of Mare Humorum. To the south-southeast is another flooded crater designated Lee, and to the southeast is Vitello. Just to the east-northeast of Doppelmayer lies the nearly submerged crater Puiseux.

The rim of Doppelmayer is nearly round, but is worn and eroded. The most intact section is the southwest half, while in the northeast the rim descends beneath the mare, leaving only a slight rise in the surface. The interior has been partially flooded by lava, leaving a large raised ridge in the center. A small range of hills curves to the west and north from the southern end of this ridge, forming a feature that is nearly concentric with the crater&#x27;s outer rim. The floor of the crater that is not covered by lava is fractured.

It was named in 1935 by the IAU after the German mathematician and astronomer Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Doppelmayer.

<text>Eudoxus is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies to the east of the northern tip of the Montes Caucasus range. It is named after the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus. It is located to the south of the prominent crater Aristoteles in the northern regions of the visible Moon. To the south is the ruined formation of Alexander, and the small crater Lamèch lies to the southwest.

The rim of Eudoxus has a series of s on the interior wall, and slightly worn s about the exterior. It lacks a single central peak, but has a cluster of low hills about the midpoint of the floor. The remainder of the interior floor is relatively level. Eudoxus has a ray system, and is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Eudoxus.

<text>Money Pit is a British television series first broadcast on Dave in 2015. It is presented by Jason Manford and Dominic Frisby, and allows investors to support crowdfunded projects.

==Background==
&quot;Money Pit&quot; is broadcast on Dave, presented by comedian Jason Manford and financial pundit Dominic Frisby, and narrated by Elizabeth Carling. The eight-part series explores the idea of crowdfunding, putting prospective investors in contact with those with business ideas. Crow TV was in charge of audio and video post, with production by Liberty Bell Productions, who have previously produced &quot;Dave Gorman: Modern Life is Goodish&quot; for Dave.

It was commissioned by Richard Watsham and Iain Coyle, with Liberty Bell&#x27;s Charlie Anderson directing the series, Jamie Isaacs and Michele Carlisle executive producing the show. Filming took place at Alexandra Palace. The music for the series was composed by Kevin Kerrigan.

In an interview with &quot;Broadcast&quot;, series producer Pat Doyle described the show as a &quot;legal minefield&quot; due to crowdfunding being heavily regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and as such the show had to remain on middle ground.

==Format==
Sixty prospective investors sit in the audience, with five contenders per episode. Each backer has submitted an amount of money into an escrow account, a communal pot. Each contender is given a couple of minutes to talk, after which a klaxon sounds and the investors are given time to fire questions at the contender, during which they reveal the sought amount followed by the incentive offered; this can be in the form of a percentage of the business, or in the form of rewards, such as &quot;for £500 I offer a tour of the facility&quot;. After a while, trading time begins and each investor may submit investment to any contender that has pitched so far, possibly at the expense of investment submitted to other contenders. This process repeats itself five times. At the end of each show, only those contenders which have attained their target amount leave with any money.

<text>Kemp&#x27;s Bay is a town on the island of Andros in the Bahamas and, before 1996, was also a district of the Bahamas.

==Former district==
The district consisted of the southern portion of the island. Its population in 2000 was 1,666 – the census recorded exactly equal numbers of males and females. The town had a population of 273 in 2010. New districts were created in Andros in 1996. The district of Kemps Bay was roughly replaced by South Andros.

==Transportation==
The village is served by South Andros Airport.

==Economy==
In 2002, businessmen Miko Maseratti and Michael Wilbanks visited the island and developed a plan to create infrastructure on the island to encourage economic growth. Part of the plan included turning grey water into usable water to encourage resort development. Geologists were hired to research the structure as well as city planners were hired for designing however there were no investors at the time and therefore the project was subsequently abandoned.

Kemp&#x27;s Bay has a grocery, a gas station, and a boat repair shop.

Kemp&#x27;s Bay is known for its bonefishing and its conch shells. The average shell on the island is the size of an American football. They are large pearly pink and can weigh as much as 15 lb. A traditional island food is the conch. It is a versatile food and can be served fried, in salad, or in soup.

Kemp&#x27;s Bay has a church and a youth center. There is no economy on the island, therefore many children grow up only to leave the island to seek work.

Homecoming festivals are a period for family island reunions when persons from each island community are encouraged to return to their roots and renew family and community ties. The festival also serves to promote community spirit and offer a venue for exposure to the culture and culinary talents of persons in the community.

<text>Fedorov is a lunar geologic feature (&quot;crater&quot; in IAU nomenclature) located in the western Mare Imbrium named after Russian rocket scientist . It lies east-northeast of the crater Diophantus, and southeast of Delisle. About 20 kilometers to the south-southeast is the slightly larger formation of Artsimovich.

This feature is slightly elongated and oddly shaped, with a ridge on the northern side. This ridge is about as large around the base as Federov crater, and rises about 0.8 km above the surrounding lunar mare.

<doc id="999586" wikidata="Q429718" url="?curid=999586" title="Flammarion (lunar crater)">
<text>Flammarion is a lunar impact crater on the south edge of Sinus Medii. Its diameter is 76 km. It is named after the French astronomer Camille Flammarion. It is located between the crater Mösting to the northwest and Herschel to the southeast. The bowl-shaped Mösting A intersects the western rim of Flammarion.

The worn outer wall of Flammarion is broken in the northwest, and the remainder is eroded and damaged. The most intact section of the wall lies to the southeast. A rille designated Rima Flammarion lies across the gap in the northwest rim, extending about 80 kilometers to the west-southwest. The crater floor has been flooded by lava, and is relatively smooth with only a few scattered craterlets to mark the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Flammarion.
