<text>The Batu Pahat District is a district in the state of Johor, Malaysia. It lies southeast of Muar, southwest of Kluang, northwest of Pontian, south of Segamat and Tangkak District. The capital of the district is Bandar Penggaram.

== Geography ==

The capital of the district Bandar Penggaram, Batu Pahat is located at . It is 239 km (150 miles) from Kuala Lumpur. The next nearest town is Muar which is 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Batu Pahat. The town of Kluang is located about 52 km (32 miles) to the northeast.
Johor Bahru is located about 70 km to 100 km (43 miles to 62 miles) to the southeast of the town.

The district itself borders the districts of Segamat to the north, Kluang to the east, Muar to the west and shares a border in the southeast with the district of Pontian. The coast of the Straits of Melaka lies to the south.

== History ==

The town acquired the name Batu Pahat, which means &quot;chiselled stone&quot;, from the quarries near the estuary. There are multiple theories as to the origin of this name. In around 1456, the Siamese army, led by Admiral Awi Di Chu, camped in Batu Pahat before attacking Malacca. Legend has it that the invading Siamese troops were chiselling rocks at a rocky spot in the coastal village of Kampung Minyak Beku, in hope to get fresh water during their retreat from the Melaka troops, led by Tun Perak, the famous Bendahara (Prime Minister) of the Malacca Sultanate. Another possible explanation for the origin of the name is the fortress (&quot;A Famosa&quot;) built by the Portuguese after capturing Melaka, which was made from granite rocks taken from the mouth of Sungai Batu Pahat.

Renowned for its salted fish in the past, Batu Pahat was formerly known as Bandar Penggaram, which means &quot;town of salt-makers&quot;. In 1893/1894, the present township was founded by Dato&#x27; Bentara Luar, Mohamed Salleh bin Perang, acting on the orders of the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Abu Bakar.

Batu Pahat was the location of the headquarters for the Fiji Infantry Regiment, serving as part of the Commonwealth forces during the Malayan Emergency, from 1952 to 1956. The 1,600 strong force saw considerable action during the campaign and contributed to the securing of the area during that period.

16 October 1980 was marked as one of Batu Pahat&#x27;s bloodiest day in recent history. At approximately 9:30 AM, 20 Muslim extremists led by Mohd. Nasir Ismail, stormed into the Batu Pahat Police station with machetes, slashing and injuring 23 police staff and civilians. 8 of the extremists were shot dead by the police. The motive of the attack was never fully determined.

Today, the ancient well can still be found in Minyak Beku, though little was done to maintain this ancient landmark which gives name to the town. For the town&#x27;s centennial celebration in the early &#x27;90s, a quaint monument depicting a floating hand chiselling a rock was set up in the town square. It became the landmark of the town instantaneously. Currently, the newly refurbished town square is popular with locals on weekend nights and also provides as a venue for many public festive celebrations.

Bandar Penggaram, Batu Pahat is growing rapidly and has now developed to become the second major town in Johor state after Johor Bahru.

== Subdivisions and administration ==

The district&#x27;s 525 gazetted villages (kampung-kampung) and village-clusters (kampung rangkaian) were annexed to their bigger immediate neighbours into &quot;mukims&quot; for the purpose of administration. The villages are represented by their village heads (ketua-ketua kampung) who answer to the subdistrict chief (Penghulu) administering the mukim. The mukim itself is under the jurisdiction of the Pegawai Daerah or District Officer. The district office of Batu Pahat also has five district engineers (Jurutera Daerah) to oversee all the subdistricts.

The district (&quot;daerah&quot;) is divided into fourteen mukims, each designated with a number (Mukim 1 to 12, 17, 18):

#Lubok (Mukim I) established 1921
#Bagan (Mukim II) established 1921

<doc id="994805" wikidata="Q3503932" url="?curid=994805" title="SunnyD">
<text>SunnyD (named Sunny Delight prior to 2000) is an orange drink developed in 1963 by Doric Foods of Mount Dora, Florida, United States. Additional plants were built in California and Ohio in 1974 and 1978, respectively. In April 1983, Sundor Brands bought out Doric Foods; Sundor Brands was then purchased by American multinational Procter &amp; Gamble in March 1989. The drink is superficially related to orange juice, but also resembles a soft drink without carbonation. 

The drink produced an estimated $450 million in revenue for Procter &amp; Gamble in 2004. In 2005, Sunny Delight was spun off into the independent Sunny Delight Beverages Company (SDBC). The beverage is also distributed by Dr Pepper/Seven Up (DPSU). In Canada, the drink is manufactured and distributed by Saputo.

The beverage was launched in the United Kingdom in April 1998 with a £10 million promotional campaign, and by August 1999, it became the third biggest selling soft drink in the United Kingdom, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

It was sold in refrigerated cabinets, and marketed as a healthier alternative to soft drinks despite neither being healthier nor requiring refrigeration. Despite the name, SunnyD is not a high source of vitamin D, nor has it ever claimed to be; however, it contains significant amounts of vitamin C.

SunnyD started out with only one flavor: orange. Now it comes in multiple flavors: Tangy Original, Smooth Orange, Orange Strawberry, Orange Mango, Orange Peach, Watermelon, Fruit Punch, Peach, Mango, Blue Raspberry, Cherry Limeade, Lemonade, and Orange Pineapple.

== Promotional campaigns ==

===Reach for the Sun Bottle Hunt===
In the middle of the 1990s, Sunny Delight sponsored an early internet contest promoting their beverage. For the game, the &quot;Reach for the Sun Bottle Hunt&quot;, simple graphics depicting Sunny Delight bottles were incorporated into independent American web sites. The site locations were various personal home pages or more well known internet resources.

At the main contest site, riddles were provided weekly to help people discover each of the sites displaying a hidden bottle. Participants were encouraged to use the newest search engines in combination with the riddles.

Initially appearing in 1996 and gaining widespread attention, the contest was repeated three times over the course of a year and a half, and over 4,000 prizes were awarded during each iteration, ranging from T-shirts to college scholarships. As a pioneering internet advertising meme, it set the stage for years of later web marketing promotions.

===Peel &#x27;n Taste Flavor Strips===
In July 2009, to promote the company&#x27;s Sunny Delight Smoothies, the company partnered with Food Lion supermarkets to place SunnyD Smoothies Peel &#x27;n Taste flavor samplers in the aisles where Sunny Delight products were located.

===Reformulation===
In recent years, the artificial sweetener sucralose has been added in combination with high fructose corn syrup, in order to cut the calorie count.

As of 2023, North American Sunny Delight contains 2% or less concentrated fruit juice.

==Controversies==
In the United Kingdom, there were many negative press reports about the product, following an investigation by The Food Commission, an independent consumer organisation in the United Kingdom.

In December 1999, according to a report by BBC News, the negative publicity escalated when a Sunny Delight television commercial showing a snowman turning orange was released, at about the same time as reports of a four-year-old girl who experienced her skin turning orange – due to the product&#x27;s use of beta-Carotene for color – after drinking an estimated 1.5 liters of Sunny Delight a day.

Sales had halved by 2001, and the drink was redesigned and reinvented in March 2003 as &quot;SunnyD&quot;. In the United Kingdom, SunnyD was relaunched in March 2009, with a new formulation containing 70% fruit juice and no artificial ingredients or added sugar. However, amid declining sales, the product was further reformulated in April 2010, as a lower priced beverage containing only 15% fruit juice.

In January 2024, the drink was the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s consumer programme &quot;Sliced Bread Presents: Toast&quot;, which discussed &quot;why sales of Sunny Delight faltered in the UK after an extremely successful launch&quot;.

The brand&#x27;s Twitter account is known for its odd tweets; one particular tweet, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t do this anymore&quot; created extensive engagement from other brands, but has received criticism for trivializing and monetizing mental illness.

Foster began her professional career at the age of thirteen in Edmonton as a young performer. A few years later, still in her teens, she moved to New York and studied acting at HB Studio with Rochelle Oliver and Elizabeth Dillon and took jazz dance with Buck Heller. A couple of years later she returned to Toronto to model and act. She was a photographic model in Toronto and Montreal and graced fashion magazines like &quot;Clin D&#x27;Oeil&quot; as well as ads for L&#x27;Oréal. She got a three-picture deal through producer Harry Alan Towers while in Toronto and was Mila in the mid-1980s film &quot;The Blade Master&quot; which was later lampooned as an episode of the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. She then played the lead of Fanny Hill in the movie of the same name 1983 movie &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; which also starred Shelley Winters and Oliver Reed.

Later on in her life she has directed most of her attention to behind the scenes work where she was proficient as camera operator, stage manager and finally as technical director on the award-winning political panel show, &quot;Week in Review&quot; (KCLA). She began her visual effects career at Cinesite in Los Angeles as part of the complex restoration team assigned to the major task of digitally reconstructing the Disney animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). Following the success of these new digital techniques, she went on to work as a technical artist on such films as &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993), &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993) and the Academy Award-nominated (for visual effects) film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993). As staff animator at Sony Pictures Imageworks, Foster lent her skills to such films as &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995), &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994), &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), &quot;Virtuosity&quot; (1995), &quot;Hideaway&quot; (1995), and &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996). Some of the films that include her visual effects work are &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; and &quot;Virtuosity&quot;.

She was last known to be directing the 3D animated series &quot;Thesaurus Rex&quot; aimed at encouraging and challenging visual and vocabulary concepts in preschoolers.

From there she moved into the game arena, first as a CG supervisor for Square&#x27;s mega-hit game &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, in which she also directed two key cinematic sequences, and then as a CG supervisor and Technical Director for the games &quot;Evil Dead: Hail to the King&quot; and THQ&#x27;s &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. After a stint as Executive Producer for the broadcast design arm of Duck Soup in Los Angeles, Lisa took the Senior Producer position at Phantagram Entertainment. Games included: &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; based on the Peter Jackson film for Electronic Arts and &quot;Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders&quot;.

<doc id="994816" wikidata="Q472303" url="?curid=994816" title="Gongsun Zan">
<text>Gongsun Zan () (before 161 - April or May 199), courtesy name Bogui, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty.

==Early life and battles with foreign tribes==
Gongsun Zan was born in Lingzhi, Liaoxi Commandery (遼西郡), which is present-day Qian&#x27;an, Hebei. He served in the secretariat commandery. His appearance was striking and his voice imposing. Furthermore, he was a talented orator. During any discussions, he would not waste time on trivial matters and concentrate on the important with great memory and pertinence in his arguments. The local Administrator (太守), whose surname was Hou (侯), was greatly impressed and married his daughter to him. He also sent him to study under the tutelage of Lu Zhi, where he bonded with Liu Bei, one of his classmates. Since Gongsun Zan was older, Liu Bei treated him like an older brother.

He was appointed as official serving in a commandery. When his Administrator (太守), whose surname was Liu (劉), was summoned by the Minister of Justice (廷尉) for an offense. Gongsun Zan drove his chariot and supported him during the travel. When he was exiled to Rinan Commandery (日南郡) in Jiao Province, Gongsun Zan decided to accompany him and prepared rice and meat as offering to his ancestors on the northern hill. There, raising his cup, he declared: &quot;I was a son and now a subordinate, going to Rinan. Now, the place is hard to live and I&#x27;m uncertain if I may one day return. Therefore, I pay my respect to my ancestors.&quot; He was so passionate in his demonstration that none did not cry watching him. As they were going south, Administrator Liu was pardoned.

Gongsun Zan was nominated as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; (civil service candidate) and appointed as Chief Clerk (長史) in Liaodong. During a patrol with tens of horsemen, he met hundreds of Xianbei riders. While retreating, Gongsun Zan told to his men that if they did not fight back then they would all be killed. With blade attached on both ends of his spear, he led the charge through the barbarians, killing and wounding them by dozens while losing half of his troop, managing to escape. The Xianbei fearful of him did not dare to pursue. He was promoted to Prefect (令) of Zhuo County (涿縣).

During the &quot;Guanghe&quot; era (光和; 178–184) of the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, Gongsun Zan was appointed as commander of 3 000 soldiers from You Province to quell a rebellion in Liang Province. However, in the northeast Zhang Chun (張純) started his own rebellion after securing the help of the Wuhuan leader Qiuliju. The rebels plundered Ji, killed and stole officials and civilians alike, from Youbeiping Commandery to Liaoxi Commandery, destroying everything in their path.

Gongsun Zan led his army against Zhang Chun defeating him and for his victory was promoted to Commandant of Cavalry (騎都尉). Following this the Wuhuan leader of Tanzhi (談指) surrendered alongside his tribe to Gongsun Zan. For this, he was appointed as General of the Household (中郎將) and received a marquis title.

However, Gongsun Zan made a costly error as he pursued Zhang Chun without waiting for reinforcements. Soon, Qiuliju came to Zhang Chun&#x27;s aid and they forced Gongsun Zan to fall back. He fled to the town of Guanzi (管子) in Liaoxi, where Qiuliju besieged him for over 200 days. Eventually, Gongsun Zan took advantage of a snowstorm to drive through a hole in the encirclement to escape. However, he also suffered around 50 to 60% losses of his soldiers. Still, he kept command of the forces in the area and fought with the rebel tribes for five or six years. Qiuliju and other Wuhuan leaders plundered the four provinces of Qing, Xu, You and Ji. Gongsun Zan was unable to prevent them from looting and killing common people.

==Service under Liu Yu (189–191)==
Liu Yu was known to be virtuous and kind. He served as Inspector of You Province (幽州刺史) and had good relations with the foreigners. Therefore, the Han government believed he could resolve the situation without the need of armed forces. He was appointed with greater authority as Governor of You Province (幽州牧). When he arrived, Liu Yu sent emissaries to the tribes to resolve the situation peacefully if they killed Zhang Chun. When Qiuliju and other Wuhuan leaders learned that Liu Yu was here, they wanted to surrender. However, Gongsun Zan was afraid that Liu Yu&#x27;s achievement would outshine his own. Therefore, he ordered his men to kill their messengers. When the tribes learned about this, they started to meet secretly with Liu Yu. Liu Yu decided to withdraw troops from their garrisons while Gongsun Zan maintained a presence at Youbeiping Commandery of 10 000 soldiers. Zhang Chun abandoned his family and fled to the Xianbei but was killed by his subordinate Wang Zheng, who had his head sent to Liu Yu. Wang Zheng received a marquis title while Liu Yu was promoted to Grand Commandant (太尉) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xiangben (襄賁侯).

Emperor Xian of Han wanted to escape Dong Zhuo&#x27;s influence and secretly sent Liu Yu&#x27;s son, Liu He (劉和) to inform his father of his intention and assist him when he would move back east. However, Yuan Shu captured Liu He and ordered him to ask for soldiers as Yuan Shu pretended he would use them to rescue the emperor. Liu Yu sent several thousand horsemen. Gongsun Zan knew that Yuan Shu was lying and didn&#x27;t want to send soldiers. However, Liu Yu refused to listen to him. As Gongsun Zan feared Yuan Shu would hold a grudge, he sent his younger cousin Gongsun Yue with a thousand horsemen while advising Yuan Shu that he should keep Liu He and Liu Yu&#x27;s soldiers. From then on, Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan were no longer on good terms. Liu He later escaped but was again imprisoned by Yuan Shao.

==Conflict with Yuan Shao (191–193)==
Gongsun Yue died at the Battle of Yangcheng and Gongsun Zan blamed Yuan Shao for his cousin&#x27;s death. He raised troops and prepared for a campaign. Yuan Shao was afraid and offered his position as Administrator of Bohai to Gongsun Fan, a cousin of Gongsun Zan. However, Gongsun Fan led the troops of Bohai to join Gongsun Zan. They defeated Yellow Turban rebels present in Qing and Xu provinces. Their armies were impressive and moved toward Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan also wrote a memorial to the imperial court, where he listed Yuan Shao&#x27;s crimes. Thereafter, he led his armies and defeated Yuan Shao forces on his way.

Gongsun Zan appointed Yan Gang as Inspector of Ji Province, Tian Kai as Inspector of Qing Province, Shan Jing as Inspector of Yan Province alongside his own officials to the commanderies and counties. While Yuan Shao led his army at Guangzong to face him. Qu Yi defeated Gongsun Zan and captured Yan Gang. Gongsun Zan then fled to Bohai and later alongside Gongsun Fan returned to Ji, where the relation with Liu Yu deteriorated.

==Against Liu Yu (193)==
As Liu Yu thought Gongsun Zan would rebel, he raised an army to attack him. However, Liu Yu was defeated and fled to Juyong. Gongsun Zan conquered Juyong and captured Liu Yu, taking him back to Ji. Around this time, Duan Xun (段訓) was sent to grant additional honours to Liu Yu. Also, Gongsun Zan was promoted to General of the Vanguard (前將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Yi (易侯). Gongsun Zan forced Duan Xun to justify the execution of Liu Yu under the pretense that Liu Yu wanted to proclaim himself Emperor.

When Liu Yu tried to resolve the matters peacefully with the foreign tribes. Gongsun Zan would disagree with him, attacking them as he believed they couldn&#x27;t be controlled. Also, thinking that if they used gold and gifts then the foreigners would belittle the Han forces. Hence this solution could only work temporarily, and not for a long time. Therefore, Gongsun Zan prevented Liu Yu from bestowing rewards to the foreigners. Liu Yu tried to meet with Gongsun Zan but Gongsun Zan would always refuse, pretending that he was ill. After Gongsun Zan&#x27;s defeat at Jieqiao. Liu Yu wanted to attack him however he was dissuaded by his official, Wei You who told him that he needed to be tolerant of Gongsun Zan&#x27;s flaws as he was a man of great military and politic talents and those abilities were needed to secure the realm.

A year later, Wei You died of illness and Liu Yu alongside his officials decided to secretly attack Gongsun Zan. However, Gongsun Zan&#x27;s soldiers surrounded by hostile forces managed to force their way through the city&#x27;s gate to regroup, pushed on by the fear of total anhilation. Liu Yu&#x27;s soldiers were also disorganized and lacked experience. Moreover, Liu Yu ordered them not to disrupt the people and prevent destruction of their houses. Gongsun Zan used this, distraught them with a fire before leading his soldiers to the attack. Liu Yu&#x27;s troops were greatly defeated while he fled to Juyong. Gongsun Zan then captured him alongside the families of his subordinates. He also killed the government officials and the people of the scholar-gentry.

Before Liu Yu&#x27;s execution, Gongsun Zan had him exposed in town. Telling that if Liu Yu would become Emperor, then he would surely be saved by Heaven&#x27;s rain. As it was one of the hottest day of summer, there was no rain. Therefore, Gongsun Zan killed Liu Yu. Just as he was about to be executed, many of his subordinates joined him. As they insulted Gongsun Zan for his actions, Gongsun Zan had them killed along with Liu Yu.

==Struggle in the north (193–199)==
From then on, Gongsun Zan became arrogant and conceited with others. He had all the well educated scholars and officials sent to far away lands. When someone asked him why, he answered that the people from the gentry believe they have a right to hold office on account of their wealthy families and have no gratitude. He associated with the arrogant and bold, from the common people. Among them were the fortune teller, Liu Weitai, the silk trader, Li Yizi, the merchant Yue Hedang alongside others. These three swore brotherhood with Gongsun Zan, who acted as the eldest brother. They had immense wealth in the hundreds of millions, some married their daughters to Gongsun Zan&#x27;s sons and compared themselves to the legends of the past.

Liu Yu&#x27;s subordinates joined with Wuhuan leader, Yan Rou to fight against Gongsun Zan. Their forces consisted of several tens of thousands, from foreign tribes and Han soldiers. Jointly, they greatly defeated Gongsun Zan&#x27;s forces led by his Administrator of Yuyang, Zou Dan (鄒丹) and killed him. Yuan Shao also cooperated his troops led by Qu Yi and Liu He with Liu Yu&#x27;s subordinates to attack Gongsun Zan. Gongsun Zan&#x27;s army was often defeated. Therefore, he retreated to Yijing where he prepared strong defences.

Around this time, there was a saying among the local children: &quot;Zhang Yan advances to the south while Yuan Shao is moving to the north. In between them, it is small but the only place to find solace.&quot; Gongsun Zan believed this place was Yijing. Therefore, he built his defences there. About this, Pei Songzhi commented that as the saying was lacking rhythm, we may be missing some of his words. He believes that the original meaning was for Gongsun Zan to defend Yijing, with no further goal but since Gongsun Zan was instrumental in the destruction of the Yellow Turbans, he had too much ambition and appointed his subordinates as Inspectors of three provinces to expand against Yuan Shao. This was the reason of his failure.

Gongsun Zan&#x27;s officers outside Yijing asked that he welcome them. However, he refused as he believed that if he allowed them in, they would no longer fight to the fullest. This created the opposite effect as when Yuan Shao reached Gongsun Zan&#x27;s southern territories, his officers realized they could not defend themselves and would be without outside help. Therefore, they killed their superiors to surrender, while others were defeated by Yuan Shao&#x27;s army. Yuan Shao easily penetrated inside Gongsun Zan&#x27;s land.

Gongsun Zan built ten moats and between all of them, he constructed fortress with a tower at the center to connect them to each other in the middle, surrounded by the other fortifications. He built his own castle, where he provisioned it with his grain supplies. He would garrison his officers inside the towers and communicate with them his written orders via pulleys. Surrounded by a thousand fortifications, he would spend his time with his wives and concubines.

Gongsun Zan told his subordinates that as they no longer have the strength to resolve problems by military forces, it was better for them to rest and administer the agriculture. As they have multiple fortifications protecting them, they could defend themselves until the situation was better. Yuan Shao had his generals attack Gongsun Zan for years but they could not defeat him. Yuan Shao also wrote a long letter, where he tried to convince Gongsun Zan to amend their relations. However, Gongsun Zan gave no answer and further develop his military base. He told his advisor Guan Jing that although people are fighting everywhere, none of them can stand around his fortress for long. Therefore, Yuan Shao wouldn&#x27;t be a source of worry.

In 199, Yuan Shao besieged Yijing. Gongsun Zan then sent his son, Gongsun Xu requesting help from the Heishan bandits. He also wanted to lead his cavalry out of the siege and joined with them to attack Ji Province. However, his advisor Guan Jing told him that if he was to leave, the fortress would be surely be lost without his leadership to hold the defenders together. With his base lost, Gongsun Zan would have nowhere to go and would be defeated. Guan Jing further believed that Yuan Shao would retreat and from there, all the armies reunited could pursue him.

Afterwards, Gongsun Zan sent a messenger to his son, where he compared Yuan Shao&#x27;s army to a ghost, constantly trying to overcome his fortifications with their towers, under the sound of drums and horns. Whether during day or night, there is no moment of peace. Zan further urged his son to reach Zhang Yan and lead fast cavalry. By the time he arrived, Zan would set a fire to the north then he would lead his soldiers out. If he failed and Gongsun Zan died then he would have the whole world to find a safe place. Gongsun Zan also had a dream of his fortress being destroyed and thought he would be defeated. He sent a letter about this to his son. However, it was intercepted. Chen Lin then sent a letter, pretending that it was written by Zan&#x27;s son, to dissuade him from trying to break the siege.

One of Yuan Shao&#x27;s soldiers captured the messenger and they learned about the signal. Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces then used it to trick Gongsun Zan. When Gongsun Zan led his soldiers out, he was ambushed and greatly defeated but still managed to retreat back to his castle. Yuan Shao&#x27;s soldiers however dug tunnels and supported by underground constructions, they overcame the towers until they reached Gongsun Zan&#x27;s own central fortress. They then set fire to the tower, forcing it to fall. Knowing that he was defeated, Gongsun Zan committed suicide through self-immolation, after killing his sisters, wives and children.

==Family==
* Gongsun Yue (), Gongsun Zan&#x27;s younger second cousin. Gongsun Zan sent him with 1,000 troops and supplies to assist the warlord Yuan Shu, who was in a proxy war with his half-brother Yuan Shao. Gongsun Yue died after being hit by a stray arrow during the Battle of Yangcheng in 191 while fighting alongside Sun Jian (Yuan Shu&#x27;s proxy) against Zhou Yu (Renming) (Yuan Shao&#x27;s proxy). Gongsun Zan used Gongsun Yue&#x27;s death as an excuse to declare war on Yuan Shao.
** In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Gongsun Yue is Gongsun Zan&#x27;s younger brother. Gongsun Zan sends Gongsun Yue as a messenger to demand that Yuan Shao keep his promise by dividing Ji Province between him and Gongsun Zan after seizing it from Han Fu, but Yuan Shao refuses. While Gongsun Yue is on his return journey, Yuan Shao orders his men to pretend to be Dong Zhuo&#x27;s soldiers and then ambush and kill Gongsun Yue. Gongsun Zan sees through Yuan Shao&#x27;s ruse and subsequently declares war on him.
* Gongsun Fan (), Gongsun Zan&#x27;s younger second cousin. He leads troops from Bohai Commandery () to join Gongsun Zan. He also fought in the Battle of Jieqiao alongside Gongsun Zan against Yuan Shao.
* Gongsun Xu (), Gongsun Zan&#x27;s son. During the Battle of Yijing (198–199), Gongsun Zan sent him to seek reinforcements from the Heishan bandits led by Zhang Yan. They returned too late as Gongsun Zan had already been defeated by Yuan Shao and had committed suicide along with the rest of his family. Gongsun Xu later met his end at the hands of the Chuge (), a Xiongnu tribe.

==White Horse Righteous Followers==
During his battles, Gongsun Zan always rode a white horse. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would pursue the enemy and was often victorious. The foreigners warned each other about him and to avoid the &quot;white horse&quot;. White horses were therefore feared by them. Gongsun Zan then selected thousands of white horses for his soldiers, calling them the &quot;White Horse Righteous Followers&quot; (). According to another account. Among the foreign tribes, the strong soldiers were the ones to ride white horses. Gongsun Zan&#x27;s army was composed of thousands of strong soldiers, most of them riding white horses therefore they were given this nickname.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

Gongsun Zan is a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He leads an elite cavalry unit called the &quot;White Riders&quot; and has served on the northern and eastern frontiers of the Han Empire by defending the borders from incursions by various non-Han Chinese tribes. In 191, Gongsun Zan joins the coalition against Dong Zhuo, the warlord who seized power in Luoyang and holds the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage. After the coalition breaks up, he gets into a rivalry with Yuan Shao over the territories in northern China and engages him in a series of battles throughout the 190s, starting with the Battle of Jieqiao and ending with his defeat and death at the Battle of Yijing.

In the novel, Gongsun Zan is nicknamed &quot;White Horse General&quot; because the elite cavalry unit he leads is made up completely of horses of pure white. The reason for doing so is that he knows that the non-Han Chinese tribes consider white horses sacred animals so they will run away when they encounter an enemy unit riding white horses in battle.

==In popular culture==
Gongsun Zan is one of the main playable characters of the video game Total War: Three Kingdoms, developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega.

==History==
During the early Zhou dynasty, the Xuchang region was granted to the Xu family (Xǔ (許/许)) of the Jiang surname and became the State of Xu, ruled by Xu Wenshu. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, Xuchang was successively occupied by the states of Zheng and Chu, and the Xu family was later relocated to Ye County by the Chu state.

Xuchang served as the warlord Cao Cao&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; capital during the late Eastern Han dynasty. After finding the old capital Luoyang ravaged by war, Cao moved the imperial court and Emperor Xian to what is now Xuchang in 196.

In 220, Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor Cao Pi officially declared the city as the capital of the newly established state of Cao Wei. The city was renamed &quot;Xuchang&quot; taken to mean &quot;Xu Rising&quot;. The Wei emperors held court at Xuchang until the capital was moved to Luoyang in the 220s.

==Geography and climate==
Xuchang ranges in latitude from 33° 16&#x27; to 34° 24&#x27; N and in longitude from 113° 03&#x27; to 114° 190&#x27; E.

Xuchang has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool and dry, summers hot and humid, spring begins early and is warm, and autumn is mild and provides a reasonable transition. Rain mainly falls from May to September, as more than 70% of the annual precipitation occurs then. The city has an annual mean temperature of at , and its highest average monthly temperature is in July and the lowest is in January. Just over of precipitation falls each year, the growing season averages 217 days and there is 2280 hours of sunshine per year.

==Economy==
Xuchang is an important center of the Chinese tobacco industry.

The manufacturing industry the city is best known for is wigs and hair extensions with exports worth about $1 billion in 2016. The industry started around 1900 when German merchants purchased hair from the local area. It was revived in the 1980s and in 1990 a local entrepreneur Zheng Youquan merged a number of smaller hair manufacturing workshops into Rebecca Hair Products, a larger entity that quickly expanded to international markets and became the largest wig maker in the world.

==Education==
Xuchang University is in the city.

==Tourism==
Famous tourist attractions include Baling Bridge and Chunqiu Tower.

==Sister city==
On 18 December 2006, the Oromia Region government in Ethiopia signed an agreement with Henan Province to establish a sister city program with Ambo. Bolingbrook, Illinois is also a sister city of Xuchang.

<doc id="994822" wikidata="Q1198171" url="?curid=994822" title="Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions">
<text>Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Northern Expeditions were a series of five military campaigns launched by the state of Shu Han against the rival state of Cao Wei from 228 to 234 during the Three Kingdoms period in China. All five expeditions were led by Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu. Although they proved unsuccessful and ended up as a stalemate, the expeditions have become some of the best known conflicts of the Three Kingdoms period and one of the few battles during it where each side (Shu and Wei) fought against each other with hundreds of thousands of troops, as opposed to other battles where one side had a huge numerical advantage.

The expeditions are dramatised and romanticised in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, where they are referred to as the &quot;six campaigns from Mount Qi&quot; (). This term is inaccurate, since Zhuge Liang only launched two of his expeditions (the first and the fourth) from Mount Qi.

==Background==

In 220, following the end of the Han dynasty, China was divided into three competing regimes – Cao Wei (or Wei), Shu Han (or Shu) and Eastern Wu (or Wu) – with each of them trying to unify the country under its rule.

In Shu, the strategic thinking behind the Northern Expeditions came from Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Longzhong Plan, which he presented to the warlord Liu Bei in 207. In essence, the plan envisaged a tripartite division of China between the domains of the warlords Liu Bei, Cao Cao and Sun Quan. According to the plan, Liu Bei would seize control of Jing Province and Yi Province from their respective governors, Liu Biao and Liu Zhang, and establish a solid foothold in southern and western China. Liu Bei would then form an alliance with Sun Quan, who ruled eastern China, and wage war against Cao Cao, who controlled northern China and the political centre of the Han dynasty in central China. Liu Bei would then lead one army from Yi Province to attack Chang&#x27;an via the Qin Mountains and Wei River valley; one of Liu Bei&#x27;s top generals would lead another army from Jing Province to attack Luoyang.

The first phase of the plan was completed in 214 when Liu Bei gained control of southern Jing Province and Yi Province. Between 217 and 219, Liu Bei launched a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery, the &quot;northern gateway&quot; into Yi Province, and succeeded in capturing it from Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. In 219, Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, whom Liu Bei had left in charge of Jing Province, started the Battle of Fancheng against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. However, the Sun Quan–Liu Bei alliance (&quot;Sun–Liu alliance&quot;), which Zhuge Liang played an instrumental role in creating, broke down when Sun Quan sent his forces to attack and seize Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province while Guan Yu was away at the Battle of Fancheng. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Between 221 and 222, Liu Bei started the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling against Sun Quan in an attempt to retake Jing Province, but failed and suffered a disastrous defeat. After Liu Bei died in 223, his son Liu Shan succeeded him as emperor of Shu, with Zhuge Liang serving as regent. In the same year, Zhuge Liang made peace with Sun Quan&#x27;s Eastern Wu regime and reestablished the Sun–Liu alliance (now the Wu–Shu alliance) against Wei, the regime established by Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, Cao Pi.

In 227, Zhuge Liang ordered troops from throughout Shu to mobilise and assemble in Hanzhong Commandery in preparation for a large-scale military campaign against Wei. Before leaving, he wrote a memorial, called &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; (literally &quot;memorial on the case to go to war&quot;), and submitted it to Liu Shan. Among other things, the memorial contained Zhuge Liang&#x27;s reasons for the campaign against Wei and his personal advice to Liu Shan on governance issues. After Liu Shan approved, Zhuge Liang ordered the Shu forces to garrison at Mianyang (沔陽; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi).

==Geography==
Zhuge Liang&#x27;s plan called for a march north from Hanzhong Commandery (what is now southern Shaanxi province), the main population centre in northern Yi Province. In the third century, Hanzhong Commandery was a sparsely populated area surrounded by wild virgin forest. Its importance lay in its strategic placement in a long and fertile plain along the Han River, between two massive mountain ranges, the Qin Mountains in the north and the Micang Mountains in the south. It was the major administrative centre of the mountainous frontier district between the rich Sichuan Basin in the south and the Wei River valley in the north. The area also afforded access to the dry northwest and the Gansu panhandle.

Geographically, the rugged barrier of the Qin Mountains provided the greatest obstacle to Chang&#x27;an. The mountain range consists of a series of parallel ridges, all running slightly south of east, separated by a maze of ramifying valleys whose canyon walls often rise sheer above the valley streams. As a result of local dislocations from earthquakes, the topographical features are extremely complicated. 

Access from the south was limited to a few mountain routes called &quot;gallery roads&quot;. These crossed major passes and were remarkable for their engineering skill and ingenuity. The oldest of these was to the northwest of Hanzhong Commandery and it crossed the San Pass. The Lianyun &quot;Linked Cloud&quot; Road was constructed there to take carriage traffic during the Qin dynasty in the third century BCE. Following the Jialing Valley, the route emerges in the north where the Wei River widens considerably near Chencang (in present-day Baoji, Shaanxi). Another important route was the Baoye route, which transverses the Yegu Pass and ends south of Mei County. A few more minor and difficult routes lay to the east, notably the Ziwu Valley, which leads directly to the south of Chang&#x27;an.

==Xincheng Rebellion==
Meng Da, a former Shu general who defected to Wei in 220, served as the Administrator of Xincheng Commandery (新城郡; in present-day northwestern Hubei) near Shu&#x27;s northeastern border. Zhuge Liang hated Meng Da for his capricious behaviour and worried that he would become a threat to Shu. Around 227, when he heard that Meng Da had a quarrel with his colleague Shen Yi (申儀), he sent spies to stir up greater suspicions between them and spread news that Meng Da was plotting a rebellion against Wei. Meng Da became fearful and decided to rebel. However, he was stuck in a dilemma after receiving a letter from the Wei general Sima Yi, who was stationed at Wancheng. In the meantime, Sima Yi quickly assembled an army, headed towards Xincheng, and reached there within eight days.

Wei&#x27;s rival states, Shu and Wu, sent forces to support Meng Da, but were defeated and driven back by Wei forces led by Sima Yi&#x27;s subordinates. Sima Yi ordered his troops to surround Shangyong (上庸), Meng Da&#x27;s base, and attack from eight directions. At the same time, he also successfully induced Meng Da&#x27;s nephew Deng Xian (鄧賢) and subordinate Li Fu (李輔) to betray Meng Da. After 16 days of siege, Deng Xian and Li Fu opened Shangyong&#x27;s gates and surrendered to Sima Yi. Meng Da was captured and executed. Sima Yi and his troops headed back to Wancheng after suppressing the rebellion. He then went to the Wei capital, Luoyang, to report to the Wei emperor Cao Rui and returned to Wancheng after that.

==First expedition==

In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang launched the first Northern Expedition and led the Shu forces to Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). At the same time, he ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to lead a decoy force to Ji Valley (箕谷) and pretend to be ready to attack Mei County, so as to divert the Wei forces&#x27; attention away from Mount Qi. News of the Shu invasion sent shock waves throughout the Guanzhong region. Three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan&#x27;an (南安), Tianshui and Anding (安定) – defected to the Shu side.

In response to the Shu invasion, Cao Rui moved from Luoyang to Chang&#x27;an to oversee the defences and provide backup. He ordered Zhang He to attack Zhuge Liang at Mount Qi, and Cao Zhen to attack Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi at Ji Valley. Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi lost the Battle of Ji Valley because their decoy force, composed of the weaker soldiers in the Shu army, were no match for Cao Zhen and his well-trained troops. (Zhuge Liang had reserved the better troops for the attack on Mount Qi.) In the meantime, Zhuge Liang sent Ma Su to lead the vanguard force to engage Zhang He at Jieting (街亭; located east of present-day Qin&#x27;an County, Gansu). Ma Su not only disobeyed Zhuge Liang&#x27;s orders, but also made the wrong moves, resulting in the Shu vanguard suffering a disastrous defeat. After his victory at the Battle of Jieting, Zhang He seized the opportunity to attack and recapture the three commanderies.

Upon learning of the Shu defeats at Ji Valley and Jieting, Zhuge Liang pulled back all his forces and retreated to Hanzhong. Although the first Northern Expedition was an overall failure, Zhuge Liang still made some small gains for Shu. The first gain was the capture of some Wei civilian families, who were then registered as Shu citizens and resettled in Hanzhong. 

The second gain was the defection of Jiang Wei, a low-ranking Wei officer who later became a prominent Shu general. After returning to Hanzhong, Zhuge Liang executed Ma Su to appease public anger and then wrote a memorial to Liu Shan, taking full responsibility for the failure of the first Northern Expedition and requesting to be punished by demotion. Liu Shan approved and symbolically demoted Zhuge Liang from Imperial Chancellor (丞相) to General of the Right (右將軍), but allowed him to remain as acting Imperial Chancellor.

==Second expedition==
In the winter of 228–229, Zhuge Liang launched the second Northern Expedition and led Shu forces to attack the Wei fortress at Chencang via San Pass. When he showed up at Chencang, he was surprised to see that it was much more heavily fortified and well-defended than he expected. That was because after the first Northern Expedition, the Wei general Cao Zhen had predicted that Shu forces would attack Chencang the next time, so he put Hao Zhao in charge of defending Chencang and strengthening its defences.

Zhuge Liang first ordered his troops to surround Chencang, then sent Jin Xiang (靳詳), an old friend of Hao Zhao, to persuade Hao Zhao to surrender. Hao Zhao refused twice. Although Hao Zhao had only 1,000 men with him to defend Chencang, he successfully held his ground against the Shu forces. During the 20-day-long siege of Chencang, Zhuge Liang used an array of tactics to attack the fortress – siege ladders, battering rams, siege towers and tunnels – but Hao Zhao successfully countered each of them in turn. Upon learning that Wei reinforcements were approaching Chencang, Zhuge Liang immediately pulled back all his troops and returned to Hanzhong. A Wei officer, Wang Shuang, led his men to attack the retreating Shu forces, but was killed in an ambush.

==Third expedition==

In the spring of 229, Zhuge Liang launched the third Northern Expedition and ordered Chen Shi to lead Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Wudu (武都) and Yinping (陰平) commanderies. The Wei general Guo Huai led his troops to resist Chen Shi. He retreated after Zhuge Liang led a Shu army to Jianwei (建威; in present-day Longnan, Gansu). The Shu forces then conquered Wudu and Yinping commanderies.

When Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign, the Shu emperor Liu Shan issued an imperial decree to congratulate him on his successes in defeating Wang Shuang during the second Northern Expedition, forcing Guo Huai to flee, winning back the trust of the local tribes and capturing Wudu and Yinping commanderies during the third Northern Expedition. He also restored Zhuge Liang to the position of Imperial Chancellor (丞相).

==Ziwu Campaign==
In August 230, Cao Zhen led an army from Chang&#x27;an to attack Shu via the Ziwu Valley (子午谷). At the same time, another Wei army led by Sima Yi, acting on Cao Rui&#x27;s order, advanced towards Shu from Jing Province by sailing along the Han River. The rendezvous point for Cao Zhen and Sima Yi&#x27;s armies was at Nanzheng County (南鄭縣; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Other Wei armies also prepared to attack Shu from the Xie Valley (斜谷) or Wuwei Commandery.

When he heard of Wei recent movements, Zhuge Liang urged Li Yan to lead 20,000 troops to Hanzhong Commandery to defend against the Wei invasion which he reluctantly accepted after much persuasion. As Xiahou Ba led the vanguard of this expedition through the 330 km Ziwu Trail (子午道), he was identified by the local residents who reported his presence to the Shu forces. Xiahou Ba barely managed to retreat after reinforcements from the main army arrived.

Zhuge Liang also allowed Wei Yan to lead troops behind the enemy lines towards Yangxi (陽谿; southwest of present-day Wushan County, Gansu) to encourage the Qiang people to join Shu Han against Wei. Wei Yan greatly defeated Wei forces led by Guo Huai and Fei Yao. Following those events, the conflict became a prolonged stalemate with few skirmishes. After more than a month of slow progress and by fear of significant losses and waste of resources, more and more Wei officials sent memorials to end the campaign. The situation wasn&#x27;t helped by the difficult topography and constant heavy rainy weather lasting more than 30 days. Cao Rui decided to abort the campaign and recalled the officers by October 230.

==Fourth expedition==

In 231, Zhuge Liang launched the fourth Northern Expedition and attacked Mount Qi again. He used the wooden ox, a mechanical device he invented, to transport food supplies to the frontline. The Shu forces attacked Tianshui Commandery and surrounded Mount Qi, which was defended by the Wei officers Jia Si (賈嗣) and Wei Ping (魏平). At Mount Qi, Zhuge Liang managed to convince Kebineng, a Xianbei tribal leader, to support Shu in the war against Wei. Kebineng went to Beidi Commandery and rallied the locals to support Shu.

At the time, as Cao Zhen, the Wei grand marshal, was ill, the Wei emperor Cao Rui ordered the general Sima Yi to move to Chang&#x27;an to supervise the Wei defences in the Guanzhong region against the Shu invasion. After making preparations for battle, Sima Yi, with Zhang He, Fei Yao, Dai Ling (戴陵) and Guo Huai serving as his subordinates, led Wei forces to Yumi County (隃麋縣; east of present-day Qianyang County, Shaanxi) and stationed there. He then left Fei Yao and Dai Ling with 4,000 troops to guard Shanggui County (上邽縣; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu), while he led the others to Mount Qi to help Jia Si and Wei Ping.

When Zhuge Liang learnt of the Wei forces&#x27; approach, he split his forces into two groups – one group to remain at Mount Qi while he led the other group to attack Shanggui County. He defeated Guo Huai, Fei Yao and Dai Ling in battle and ordered his troops to collect the harvest in Shanggui County. In response, Sima Yi turned back from Mount Qi, headed to Shanggui County, and reached there within two days. By then, Zhuge Liang and his men had finished harvesting the wheat and were preparing to leave. Zhuge Liang encountered Sima Yi at Hanyang (漢陽) to the east of Shanggui County, but they did not engage in battle: Zhuge Liang ordered his troops to make use of the terrain and get into defensive positions; Sima Yi ordered his troops to get into formation, while sending Niu Jin to lead a lightly armed cavalry detachment to Mount Qi. The stand off ended when Zhuge Liang and the Shu forces retreated to Lucheng (鹵城), took control of the hills in the north and south, and used the river as a natural barrier.

Although his subordinates repeatedly urged him to attack the enemy, Sima Yi was hesitant to do so after seeing the layout of the Shu camps in the hills. However, he eventually relented when Jia Si and Wei Ping mocked him and said he would become a laughing stock if he refused to attack. Sima Yi then sent Zhang He to attack the Shu camp in the south, guarded by Wang Ping, while he led the others to attack Lucheng head-on. In response, Zhuge Liang ordered Wei Yan, Wu Ban and Gao Xiang to resist the enemy outside Lucheng, where the Wei forces suffered an unexpected and tremendous defeat: 3,000 soldiers were killed, and 5,000 suits of armour and 3,100 sets of hornbeam crossbows were seized by Shu forces. Even though the losses were heavy, Sima Yi still retained a sizeable army, which he led back to his camp.

Despite the victory, Zhuge Liang could not press his advantage with a major offensive due to a dwindling food supply. Adverse weather prevented Shu&#x27;s logistics from delivering matériel on schedule. Li Yan, the Shu general responsible for overseeing the transportation of food supplies to the frontline, falsely claimed that the emperor Liu Shan had ordered a withdrawal. The &quot;Book of Jin&quot; claimed that Sima Yi launched an attack on Shu garrisons at this juncture and succeeded in capturing the Shu &quot;covering camps&quot;. Zhuge Liang abandoned Lucheng and retreated under the cover of night, but Sima Yi pursued him and inflicted roughly 10,000 casualties on the Shu army. This account from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; is disputed by historians and is not included in the 11th-century outstanding chronological historical text &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;.

In any case, according to &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, Zhuge Liang retreated to the Shu, because of lack of supply, not defeat. and the Wei forces pursued him. The pursuit did not go completely smoothly for Wei. Sima Yi ordered Zhang He to further pursue the enemy in an attempt to capitalise on their momentum. The &quot;Weilüe&quot; mentioned that Zhang He refused to obey Sima Yi&#x27;s order and argued that, according to classical military doctrine, one should refrain from pursuing an enemy force retreating to its home territory. However, Sima Yi refused to listen and forced Zhang He to carry out this order. Indeed, Zhang He fell into an ambush at Mumen Trail (木門道; near present-day Qinzhou District, Tianshui, Gansu), where Zhuge Liang had ordered crossbowmen to hide on high ground and fire at approaching enemy forces when they entered a narrow defile. Zhang He died after a stray arrow hit him in the right knee. Unlike &quot;book of Jin&quot; records, Wei&#x27;s army suffered a great deal of damage from pursuing Shu&#x27;s retreating army.

==Fifth expedition==

In the spring of 234, Zhuge Liang led more than 100,000 Shu troops out of Xie Valley (斜谷) and camped at the Wuzhang Plains on the south bank of the Wei River near Mei County. Aside from using the flowing horse to transport food supplies to the frontline, he implemented a &quot;tuntian&quot; plan by ordering his troops to grow crops alongside civilians at the south bank of the Wei River. He also forbade his troops from taking the civilians&#x27; crops.

In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei general Sima Yi led his forces and another 20,000 reinforcements to the Wuzhang Plains to engage the enemy. After an initial skirmish and a night raid on the Shu camp, Sima Yi received orders from the Wei emperor Cao Rui to hold his ground and refrain from engaging the Shu forces. The battle became a stalemate. During this time, Zhuge Liang made several attempts to lure Sima Yi to attack him. On one occasion, he sent women&#x27;s ornaments to Sima Yi to taunt him. An apparently angry Sima Yi sought permission from Cao Rui to attack the enemy but was denied. Cao Rui even sent Xin Pi as his special representative to the frontline to ensure that Sima Yi followed orders and remained in camp. Zhuge Liang knew that Sima Yi was pretending to be angry because he wanted to show the Wei soldiers that he would not put up with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s taunting and to ensure that his men were ready for battle.

During the stalemate, when Zhuge Liang sent a messenger to meet Sima Yi, Sima Yi asked the messenger about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s daily routine and living conditions. The messenger said that Zhuge Liang consumed three to four &quot;sheng&quot; of grain a day and that he micromanaged almost everything, except trivial issues like punishments for minor offences. After hearing that, Sima Yi remarked, &quot;How can Zhuge Kongming expect to last long? He&#x27;s going to die soon.&quot;

The stalemate at the Wuzhang Plains lasted for over 100 days. Sometime between 11 September and 10 October 234, Zhuge Liang became critically ill and died in camp. He was 54 (by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death.

When Sima Yi heard from civilians that Zhuge Liang had died from illness and that the Shu army had burnt down their camp and retreated, he led his troops in pursuit and caught up with them. The Shu forces, on Yang Yi and Jiang Wei&#x27;s command, turned around and readied themselves for battle. Sima Yi pulled back his troops and retreated. Some days later, while surveying the remains of the Shu camp, Sima Yi remarked, &quot;What a genius he was!&quot; Based on his observations that the Shu army made a hasty retreat, he concluded that Zhuge Liang had indeed died and so he led his troops in pursuit again. When Sima Yi reached Chi&#x27;an (赤岸), he asked the civilians living there about Zhuge Liang and heard that there was a recent popular saying: &quot;A dead Zhuge (Liang) scares away a living Zhongda&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;I can predict the thoughts of the living but I can&#x27;t predict those of the dead.&quot;

==Results==
Zhuge Liang&#x27;s expeditions managed to inflict damage to the Wei army, killed several notable Wei commanders, and captured two small commanderies, but he failed to fulfil his strategic goal. After Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death, his successor, Jiang Wan, changed the policy and turned to a defensive stance. Some people in Eastern Wu suspected that Shu Han wanted to renege on the Shu-Wu alliance, but Sun Quan commented that it was simply a sign of fatigue and exhaustion.

Yi Zhongtian listed three reasons for Zhuge Liang&#x27;s failures:

#Strong enemy: Cao Wei regime was robust and stable and had many talents (such as Sima Yi) and so could not be easily tackled by Shu Han.
#Rough terrain: Cao Wei and Shu Han were separated by natural barriers, which put extremely heavy logistical burdens on the Shu Han army including providing adequate food supply. This was a key reason for the failure of the expeditions.
#Zhuge Liang&#x27;s own limitations: Zhuge Liang was an excellent military organizer but not an outstanding military commander. Zhuge Liang lacked the cleverness and decisiveness of a military general since he could properly lead an army but could not conduct complex and deceptive moves.

Yi Zhongtian argued that Zhuge Liang knew full well of all of the difficulties, including his own weaknesses, but Liang still pressed on with the Northern Expeditions for three reasons:

#Han restoration: Zhuge Liang was sincere and faithful to his goal of restoring the Han dynasty. He could change the tactics depended on the situation but never deviated from his ultimate goal.
#Waging war for internal stability: The expeditions also served as a means to maintain the &quot;state of war&quot; and hence &quot;martial rule&quot; over Shu Han. Zhuge Liang wanted to use &quot;martial rule&quot; to tighten control over the local nobility and the privileged classes, which were not always happy with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s legalist policies.
#Pre-emptive strike: Being the weakest of the three kingdoms, Shu Han would be the first one to be preyed upon. The only solution for that was making pre-emptive strikes to intimidate the enemy and to enlarge Shu Han&#x27;s own power base. The pre-emptive moves did not guarantee a 100% success rate, but the option was better than doing nothing and withering away

In other words, Shu Han&#x27;s relentless attacks against stronger enemy were from Zhuge Liang&#x27;s point of view actually necessary for its own survival. Zhuge Liang was praised for being far-sighted in recognising this issue.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The Northern Expeditions in the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; are heavily fictionalized and romanticized.

<text>Jeffrey D. &quot;Jeff&quot; Watson (born March 25, 1971, in Windsor, Ontario) served as the Member of Parliament for the Essex electoral district in Ontario, from 2004 to 2015.

In the 2015 General Election, and after four terms in office, Watson narrowly lost his seat to the NDP. The Watsons relocated to Calgary, Alberta looking for a better life.

Watson and his wife Sarah have six children.

== Member of Parliament for Essex, Ontario, 2004-2015 ==
Watson was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Essex in June 2004 and re-elected in January 2006 and October 2008 as a member of the Conservative Government led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Watson was the first centre-right MP elected for Essex or its predecessors in 46 years. He also had the distinction of being designated by the Library of Parliament as the first autoworker elected to the Parliament of Canada.

Watson served on the Standing Committee on the Environment &amp; Sustainable Development and on the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure &amp; Communities. He was also Chair of the Government Auto Caucus, a member of the All-Party border Caucus, and the Canada-UK, Canada-Italy Inter-Parliamentary Groups. As well he served as a member of the Executive and Vice-Chair respectively as a member of the Canada-Israel and Canada-US Inter-Parliamentary Groups.

In February 2007, Watson came under criticism for comments made at a hearing of the Special Legislative Committee on Canada&#x27;s Clean Air Act that linked greenhouse gas reductions to a demise in the Canadian economy which could result in domestic violence and suicide. While in April 2007, the government tabled a report detailing how C-288 will plunge Canada into a recession costing 275,000 jobs, echoing the MPs concerns.

Following his studies in history and political science at the University of Windsor, Watson worked as an executive assistant and marketing director before joining the line at the Trim Division at Daimler Chrysler&#x27;s Windsor Assembly Plant, where he was employed for seven years.

In January 2007, the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; reported that a former campaign worker from Watson&#x27;s 2004 campaign threatened he would &quot;kill Jeff Watson with (his) bare hands&quot;, was charged by the Ontario Provincial Police and sent to trial. The defendant was later acquitted as the Ontario court judge, Justice Lloyd Dean, could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the words were spoken to intimidate or strike fear. &quot;I had to deal with whether or not the matter was before the court because the young ladies [the witnesses] were fearful of Mr. Kouvalis or assessing what move to make and what evidence to give because they were concerned about the political consequences for Mr. Kouvalis, Mr. Watson and the Conservative party&quot;, the judge said.

The case was complicated by the admission in court that &quot;Witness Kaydee Schnekenburger, a former campaign worker for Watson ... testified earlier in the trial that she and Angela Jonsson, another witness .. met with Watson and his wife, Sarah, at the MP&#x27;s home for three hours and discussed the sequence of events in the case.

Watson was re-elected in the 2008 federal election. He became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport on September 19, 2013.

In May 2015, the Jewish National Fund Windsor honoured Jeff Watson. &quot;Over 500 people attended the event to pay tribute to Mr. Watson for his great work in serving [the Jewish] community and for his strong support of Israel. .. with a fascinating keynote address from The Honourable Jason Kenney.&quot;

Watson was defeated in 2015 by the New Democratic Party, despite a Liberal Party majority elsewhere in the country.

==2015-present==

In 2015, the Watsons relocated to Calgary, Alberta for their Children. Watson stated &quot;The kids, some of them want to ride horses. My boys, 11 and 13 — they want to mountain bike extreme style. One of them wants to snowboard.&quot; Watson continued to on, &quot;Asked if he’ll be getting into politics in Alberta, Watson said he’ll likely help out on the campaigns of friends like fellow Conservative Jason Kenney&quot;

In 2017, Watson become the Director, Coalitions and Outreach for Unite Alberta / Jason Kenney Leadership.

In addition to being a member of Jason Kenney&#x27;s campaign leadership team during 2016–17, Watson has also continued his work in Federal Politics and acts as an advisor to the Hon. Andrew Scheer.

Watson is also working with Ric McIver in the United Conservative Party held riding of Calgary-Hays as a Constituency Assistant.

<doc id="994834" wikidata="Q182017" url="?curid=994834" title="Korean numerals">
<text>The Korean language has two regularly used sets of numerals: a native Korean system and Sino-Korean system. The native Korean number system is used for general counting, like counting up to 99. It is also used to count people, hours, objects, ages, and more. Sino-Korean numbers on the other hand are used for purposes such as dates, money, minutes, addresses, phone numbers, and numbers above 99.

==Construction==
For both native and Sino- Korean numerals, the teens (11 through 19) are represented by a combination of tens and the ones places. For instance, 15 would be &quot;sib-o&quot; (), but not usually &quot;il-sib-o&quot; in the Sino-Korean system, and &quot;yeol-daseot&quot; () in native Korean. Twenty through ninety are likewise represented in this place-holding manner in the Sino-Korean system, while Native Korean has its own unique set of words, as can be seen in the chart below. The grouping of large numbers in Korean follows the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000). The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the Chinese numerals.

The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: &quot;yeol beon&quot; () means &quot;ten times&quot; while &quot;sip beon&quot; () means &quot;number ten.&quot;

When denoting the age of a person, one will usually use &quot;sal&quot; () for the native Korean numerals, and &quot;se&quot; () for Sino-Korean. For example, &quot;seumul-daseot sal&quot; () and &quot;i-sib-o se&quot; () both mean &#x27;twenty-five-year-old&#x27;. See also East Asian age reckoning.

The Sino-Korean numerals are used to denote the minute of time. For example, &quot;sam-sib-o bun&quot; () means &quot;__:35&quot; or &quot;thirty-five minutes.&quot;
The native Korean numerals are used for the hours in the 12-hour system and for the hours 0:00 to 12:00 in the 24-hour system. The hours 13:00 to 24:00 in the 24-hour system are denoted using both the native Korean numerals and the Sino-Korean numerals. For example, &quot;se si&quot; () means &#x27;03:00&#x27; or &#x27;3:00 a.m./p.m.&#x27; and &quot;sip-chil si&quot; () or &quot;yeol-ilgop si&quot; () means &#x27;17:00&#x27;.

Some of the native numbers take a different form in front of measure words:

The descriptive forms for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20 are formed by &quot;dropping the last letter&quot; from the original native cardinal, so to speak. Examples:
* &quot;han beon&quot; (&quot;once&quot;)
* &quot;du gae&quot; (&quot;two things&quot;)
* &quot;se si&quot; (&quot;three o&#x27;clock&quot;), in contrast, in North Korea the Sino-Korean numeral &quot;sam&quot; would normally be used; making it &quot;sam si&quot;
* &quot;ne myeong&quot; (&quot;four people&quot;)
* &quot;seumu mari&quot; (&quot;twenty animals&quot;)

Something similar also occurs in some Sino-Korean cardinals:
* &quot;onyuwol&quot; (&quot;May and June&quot;)
* &quot;yuwol&quot; (&quot;June&quot;)
* &quot;siwol&quot; (&quot;October&quot;)

The cardinals for three and four have alternative forms in front of some measure words:
* &quot;seok dal&quot; (&quot;three months&quot;)
* &quot;neok jan&quot; (&quot;four cups&quot;)

Korean has several words formed with two or three consecutive numbers. Some of them have irregular or alternative forms.
* &quot;handul&quot; (&quot;one or two&quot;) / &quot;handu&quot; (&quot;one or two&quot; in front of measure words)
* &quot;duset&quot; (&quot;two or three&quot;) / &quot;duse&quot; (&quot;two or three&quot; in front of measure words)
* &quot;seoneot&quot; (&quot;three or four&quot;) / &quot;seoneo&quot; (&quot;three or four&quot; in front of measure words)
* &quot;duseoneot&quot; (&quot;two or three or four&quot;) / &quot;duseoneo&quot; (&quot;two or three or four&quot; in front of measure words)
* &quot;neodeot&quot;, &quot;nedaet&quot;, &quot;nedaseot&quot;, &quot;neodeodaet&quot; (&quot;four or five&quot;)
* &quot;daeyeoseot&quot;, &quot;daeyeot&quot; (&quot;five or six&quot;)
* &quot;yenilgop&quot; (&quot;six or seven&quot;)
* &quot;ilgoyeodeol&quot;, &quot;ilyeodeol&quot; (&quot;seven or eight&quot;)
* &quot;yeodeolahop&quot;, &quot;yeotahop&quot; (&quot;eight or nine&quot;)

As for counting days in native Korean, another set of unique words are used:
* &quot;haru&quot; (&quot;one day&quot;)
* &quot;iteul&quot; (&quot;two days&quot;)
* &quot;saheul&quot; (&quot;three days&quot;)
* &quot;sanaheul&quot;, &quot;sanal&quot; (&quot;three or four days&quot;)
* &quot;naheul&quot; (&quot;four days&quot;)
* &quot;nedaessae&quot;, &quot;neodaessae&quot;, &quot;neodeodaessae&quot;, &quot;nadal&quot; (&quot;four or five days&quot;)
* &quot;dassae&quot; (&quot;five days&quot;)
* &quot;daeyeossae&quot; (&quot;five or six days&quot;)
* &quot;yeossae&quot; (&quot;six days&quot;)
* &quot;yenire&quot; (&quot;six or seven days&quot;)
* &quot;ire&quot; (&quot;seven days&quot;)
* &quot;ilyeodeure&quot; (&quot;seven or eight days&quot;)
* &quot;yeodeure&quot; (&quot;eight days&quot;)
* &quot;aheure&quot; (&quot;nine days&quot;)
* &quot;yeolheul&quot; (&quot;ten days&quot;)
The native Korean &quot;saheul&quot; () is often misunderstood as the Sino-Korean &quot;sail&quot; () due to similar sounds. The two words are different in origin and have different meanings.

==Cardinal numerals==
== Larger numbers ==
In numbers above 10, elements are combined from largest to smallest, and zeros are implied. Hanja and Hangul numerals are both multiplicative additive rather than positional; to write the number 20 you get the character for two (二/이) and then the character for ten (十/십) to get two tens or twenty (二十/이십).

==Pronunciation==
The initial consonants of measure words and numbers following the native cardinals (&#x27;eight&#x27;, only when the is not pronounced) and (&#x27;ten&#x27;) become tensed consonants when possible. Thus for example:
* (twelve) is pronounced like 
* (eight (books)) is pronounced like 

Several numerals have long vowels, namely (two), (three) and (four), but these become short when combined with other numerals / nouns (such as in twelve, thirteen, fourteen and so on).

The usual liaison and consonant-tensing rules apply, so for example, &quot;yesun-yeoseot&quot; (sixty-six) is pronounced like (&quot;yesun-nyeoseot&quot;) and &quot;chil-sip&quot; (seventy) is pronounced like &quot;chil-ssip&quot;.

== Constant suffixes used in Sino-Korean ordinal numerals==
&quot;Beon&quot; (), &quot;ho&quot; (), &quot;cha&quot; (), and &quot;hoe&quot; () are always used with Sino-Korean or Arabic ordinal numerals. For example, &quot;Yihoseon&quot; () is Line Number Two in a metropolitan subway system. &quot;Samsipchilbeongukdo&quot; () is highway number 37. They cannot be used interchangeably.

 is &#x27;Apt #906&#x27; in a mailing address. 906 without &quot;ho&quot; () is not used in spoken Korean to imply apartment number or office suite number. The special prefix &quot;je&quot; () is usually used in combination with suffixes to designate a specific event in sequential things such as the Olympics.

==Substitution for disambiguation==
In commerce or the financial sector, some Hanja for each Sino-Korean numbers are replaced by alternative ones to prevent ambiguity or retouching. 
For verbally communicating number sequences such as phone numbers, ID numbers, etc., especially over the phone, native Korean numbers for 1 and 2 are sometimes substituted for the Sino-Korean numbers. For example, &quot;o-o-o hana-dul-hana-dul&quot; () instead of &quot;o-o-o il-i-il-i&quot; () for &#x27;555-1212&#x27;, or &quot;sa-o-i-hana&quot; () instead of &quot;sa-o-i-il&quot; () for &#x27;4521&#x27;, because of the potential confusion between the two similar-sounding Sino-Korean numbers.

For the same reason, military transmissions are known to use mixed native Korean and Sino-Korean numerals:

==Notes==
* Note 1: Korean assimilation rules apply as if the underlying form were |sip.ryuk|, giving &quot;sim-nyuk&quot; instead of the expected &quot;sib-yuk&quot;.
* Note 2: These names are considered archaic, and are not used.
* Note 3: The numbers higher than 1020 (&quot;hae&quot;) are not usually used.
* Note 4: The names for these numbers are from Buddhist texts; they are not usually used. Dictionaries sometimes disagree on which numbers the names represent.

<doc id="994848" wikidata="Q1319513" url="?curid=994848" title="Odin (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Odin Borson, the All-Father is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. First mentioned in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #85 (Oct. 1962), the character first appears in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #86 (Nov. 1962), and was adapted from the Odin of Norse mythology by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The character is depicted as the father of Thor and, traditionally, as the king of Asgard.

Sir Anthony Hopkins portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2013), and &quot;&quot; (2017).

==Publication history==
Although Odin was first mentioned in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #85 (Oct. 1962), his first actual appearance was in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #86 (November 1962). He was created for Marvel Comics by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
Odin is the son of Bor (father, one of the first Asgardians) and Bestla (mother, a frost giantess), and the full brother of Vili and Ve. With the aid of his brothers, a young Odin defeats the fire demon Surtur; later, Odin reveals that his brothers were killed by Surtur, but gave their power to Odin. Later Surtur was imprisoned inside the Earth. Odin thereafter became ruler of Asgard, where he received the epithet of &quot;All-Father&quot;, and eventually fell in love with the elder goddess, Gaea, by whom he is the father of Thor. After Thor&#x27;s birth, Odin returns to Asgard, where his wife, Frigga, acts as Thor&#x27;s mother. Odin is also the adoptive father of Loki, a child of Giant ancestry whose father Laufey is killed by Odin in battle: adopted in a deal with Bor&#x27;s spirit, unaware of Bor&#x27;s intention that the child would bring about Odin&#x27;s downfall. Despite Odin&#x27;s intentions, Thor and Loki become bitter enemies. Odin also was the father of Balder from Frigga.

Thor&#x27;s preoccupation with Midgard (Earth) is a constant annoyance to Odin who, as punishment, has deprived Thor of his powers on at least three occasions. Each time, Thor&#x27;s willingness to atone for his transgressions, his continued noble intentions, and his bravery, eventually convince Odin to restore his original powers and identity.

As ruler and protector of the Asgardian people, Odin has been involved in a number of crises that have threatened Asgard and, on occasion, Earth. Notable examples included stopping Loki, the Storm Giant Skagg, and Surtur (with the aid of Thor and Balder); defeating Absorbing Man after he absorbs almost all of Asgard; banishing the monster Mangog; sacrificing his right eye to Mimir for the wisdom to stop Ragnarök (Twilight of the Gods); attempting to stop the Celestials in the armor of the Destroyer; engaging inter-dimensional tyrant Dormammu in a &quot;cosmic chess&quot; match as champions of Master Order and Lord Chaos respectively, and preventing Surtur from lighting the Sword of Doom, Twilight.

Odin has also died three times in defense of Asgard. On the first occasion, Odin is killed by Mangog, and later revived by Hela. On the second occasion, the Celestials melt the Destroyer, and thus stifle all Asgardians except Thor, who collects a portion of energy from each pantheon and uses it to revive Odin, who in turn resurrects the Asgardians.

The final occasion involves a massive battle against Surtur on Earth, with Odin apparently dying once and for all, when the Odin Force—the source of Odin&#x27;s power—migrates to his son, Thor. As Thor eventually destroys the Loom of Fates and stops Asgard from perpetuating Ragnarok—which ends the entire Norse pantheon and Asgard itself—Thor believes Odin may be dead permanently. The Odin Force appears to him in humanoid form and says that this was Odin&#x27;s plan all along.

When Thor returns from hibernation in the void, he begins to find the lost Asgardians, but does not search for his father. During his Odinsleep, Thor finds Odin in a limbo wherein every day he does battle with Surtur. Odin declines Thor&#x27;s offer of taking his place—noting that just Thor&#x27;s offer has broken Bor&#x27;s curse that he would be abandoned as Bor was—and states that Thor must lead the Asgardians, while Odin continues in a state approximating the Asgardian equivalent of heaven, to prevent Surtur from reentering the world. Loki assuages Doctor Doom&#x27;s fears about Odin&#x27;s potential wrath if the Asgardians move to Latveria, assuring him that &quot;Old One-Eye is yesterday&#x27;s god&quot; and &quot;a relic&quot;. Later, Odin&#x27;s absence from the Nine Worlds leads his revived father Bor to wage battle against Thor after Loki and Hela revive him. When Bor is killed, Loki and Balder have Thor exiled for regicide.

During the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Norman Osborn sends the Thunderbolts to steal Odin&#x27;s spear Gungnir from the Asgardian weaponry. Loki calls on Odin to return the Norn Stones to him so he can empower the heroes to defeat the Void.

Odin returns from the dead after Asgard is invaded by the World-Eaters.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Odin senses the return of his elder brother, the fear god Cul. After a brief monologue with Uatu the Watcher, Odin commands his people to return to the Asgardian plane against the protests of Thor, and Asgard rebuilds into a war engine with which he intends to raze Earth completely, to destroy the Serpent. Thor convinces Odin to send him back to Earth instead, and Iron Man travels to Asgard-space for an audience with Odin, wherein Iron Man asks Odin if he can use one of Asgard&#x27;s workshops to make weapons, and Odin allows him to use the Workshops of Svartalfheim, to stop the Serpent before his shadow falls on the World Tree. Captain America and the Avengers bring an unconscious Thor to Broxton so that Odin can heal Thor. As he tends to his son, Odin confesses that he has always tried to prevent Thor&#x27;s prophesied death by the Serpent, not to prevent Ragnarok, but because he loves his son and does not want to see him perish. Odin prepares Thor by giving him the armor and helmet that he himself wore the last time he cast out the Serpent and gives Thor the Odinsword, named Ragnarok (which was forged to end all things). While Thor kills the Serpent at the cost of his own life, Odin frees those affected by the Hammers of the Worthy, and returns to Asgard with the corpse of the Serpent sealing off Asgard from Hermod and a number of other Asgardians left on Earth.

In the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, it is revealed to Thor that Angela is the daughter of Odin and Frigga; &quot;killed&quot; as an infant during Asgard&#x27;s war with the Angels of the Tenth Realm, whereupon Odin severed the tenth realm from the other nine as &quot;punishment&quot;. Odin was later freed from his self-exile by Loki as he is set to return to Asgard. The fight between Thor and Angela is interrupted when Odin recognizes Angela as his daughter and reveals Angela&#x27;s true history, wherein an Angel raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. Due to her services for the Angels, the Queen pardoned Angela her life, but exiled her from Heaven for her lineage. After leaving Heaven, Odin tells Thor, Loki, and Angela that he still loves his children.

Angered that someone else is wielding Mjolnir, Odin sends the Destroyer after the new female Thor, appointing Cul Borson as his new &#x27;Minister of Justice&#x27; to enforce his new decrees and operate the Destroyer, but Odinson and Freyja assemble an army of female superheroes to aid her, forcing Odin to stand down.

In &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Odin dreams of the end of all existence in an event greater than Ragnarok. He additionally battles King Loki, an evil alternate timeline variant of Loki who threatens to destroy Asgard.

In &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Odin has become a tyrant ruling Asgard with an iron fist ever since Thor&#x27;s disappearance. He makes use of the Thunder Guard and the Destroyer Armor to protect his kingdom and even went so far as to imprison Frigga and anyone who gets in his way. His reason for imprisoning Frigga is because she assisted the female Thor against the Destroyer. Odin fought the female Thor when she interrupted Frigga&#x27;s trial. After the battle is halted when Loki used a poisoned dagger on Frigga, Odin took Frigga&#x27;s body to his Odinsleep chamber where he placed some of his powers into her.

In &quot;Generations&quot;, Odin reminisces with the Phoenix Force about their previous love affair. He is revealed to have been part of a past incarnation of the Avengers in 1,000,000 BC alongside Agamotto, Black Panther, Ghost Rider, Iron Fist, Phoenix, and Star Brand.

During the &quot;Death of Thor&quot; arc, Odin faces the return of Mangog and is unable to defeat it. Jane Foster sacrifices herself to stop Mangog before Odin and Thor resurrect her.

In &quot;The War of the Realms&quot;, Malekith attempts to kill Odin. However, he survives and appoints Thor as his successor. In &quot;Thor&quot; (vol. 6), Odin sacrifices himself to give Thor his power and help him defeat Mangog.

==Powers and abilities==
As King of the Norse Gods, Odin possesses vast strength, stamina and durability far greater than that of a normal Asgardian, along with resistance to all Earthly diseases and toxins, incredible resistance to magic and, as a courtesy of the Golden Apples of Idunn, a greatly extended lifespan. Odin has all the abilities of his son Thor, but to a much greater degree. Odin is capable of manipulating the Odinforce—a powerful source of energy—for a number of purposes, including energy projection; creation of illusions and force fields; levitation; molecular manipulation, communicating telepathically with other Asgardians even if they are on Earth and he is in Asgard, hypnotizing humans; channelling lightning to Earth from Asgard, controlling the lifeforces of all Asgardians, and teleportation. The character has also used the Odinforce for greater feats such as transporting the entire human race to an alternate dimension; stopping time; pulling the remains of distant planets down from outer space to crush his foes, compressing the population of an entire planet into a single being, the Mangog and then recreating the race and taking a soul away from the arch-demon Mephisto. The Odinforce makes Odin capable of destroying entire galaxies, allowing him to engage entities such as Galactus on their own terms. In some stories, Odin has been portrayed at a universal or even multiversal scale of power.

In battles against opponents of similar power, Odin carries the magical spear Gungnir (&quot;The Spear of Heaven&quot;), an artifact made of the metal uru, that can be used to channel the Odinforce. Even without the Odinforce it can still match Thor&#x27;s hammer in battle. Once a year, during the Asgardian winter, Odin must undertake the Odinsleep for 24 hours to regenerate (and is closely guarded as he is vulnerable during this period), although he can be weakened by potent spells, such as those of Karnilla.

Odin is also a master tactician and schemer, and has prevented Ragnarok, and planned for centuries for the coming of the Celestial Fourth Host. The character also on occasion uses the eight-legged steed Sleipnir and the enchanted ship &quot;Skipbladnir&quot;, which can navigate the &quot;sea of space&quot; and shrink to the size of a toy.

==Reception==
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Odin 3rd in their &quot;10 Marvel Gods With The Highest Kill Count&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Spider-Geddon===
In Spider-Punk&#x27;s universe, Odin is the source of Eric Masters&#x27; powers.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An alternate universe variant of Odin from Earth-1610 appears in the Ultimate Marvel universe. This version is the embodiment of Asgard and the source of power for Mjolnir and the Norn Stones. He is killed by the Children of Tomorrow, but returns to assist Thor as a spirit.

==In other media==

<doc id="994887" wikidata="Q862571" url="?curid=994887" title="Petroleum industry">
<text>The petroleum industry, also known as the oil industry, includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, transportation (often by oil tankers and pipelines), and marketing of petroleum products. The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic fragrances, and plastics. The industry is usually divided into three major components: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Upstream regards exploration and extraction of crude oil, midstream encompasses transportation and storage of crude, and downstream concerns refining crude oil into various end products.

Petroleum is vital to many industries, and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration, making it a critical concern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world&#x27;s energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia, to a high of 53% for the Middle East.

Other geographic regions&#x27; consumption patterns are as follows: South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). The world consumes 36 billion barrels (5.8 km3) of oil per year, with developed nations being the largest consumers. The United States consumed 18% of the oil produced in 2015. The production, distribution, refining, and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world&#x27;s largest industry in terms of dollar value.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
Petroleum is a naturally occurring liquid found in rock formations. It consists of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, plus other organic compounds. It is generally accepted that oil is formed mostly from the carbon rich remains of ancient plankton after exposure to heat and pressure in Earth&#x27;s crust over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the decayed residue was covered by layers of mud and silt, sinking further down into Earth&#x27;s crust and preserved there between hot and pressured layers, gradually transforming into oil reservoirs.

===Early history===
Petroleum in an unrefined state has been utilized by humans for over 5000 years. Oil in general has been used since early human history to keep fires ablaze and in warfare.

Its importance to the world economy however, evolved slowly, with whale oil being used for lighting in the 19th century and wood and coal used for heating and cooking well into the 20th century. Even though the Industrial Revolution generated an increasing need for energy, this was initially met mainly by coal, and from other sources including whale oil. However, when it was discovered that kerosene could be extracted from crude oil and used as a lighting and heating fuel, the demand for petroleum increased greatly, and by the early twentieth century had become the most valuable commodity traded on world markets.

===Modern history===


Imperial Russia produced 3,500 tons of oil in 1825 and doubled its output by mid-century. After oil drilling began in the region of present-day Azerbaijan in 1846, in Baku, the Russian Empire built two large pipelines: the 833 km long pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian to the Black Sea port of Batum (Baku-Batum pipeline), completed in 1906, and the 162 km long pipeline to carry oil from Chechnya to the Caspian. The first drilled oil wells in Baku were built in 1871–1872 by Ivan Mirzoev, an Armenian businessman who is referred to as one of the &#x27;founding fathers&#x27; of Baku&#x27;s oil industry.

At the turn of the 20th century, Imperial Russia&#x27;s output of oil, almost entirely from the Apsheron Peninsula, accounted for half of the world&#x27;s production and dominated international markets. Nearly 200 small refineries operated in the suburbs of Baku by 1884. As a side effect of these early developments, the Apsheron Peninsula emerged as the world&#x27;s &quot;oldest legacy of oil pollution and environmental negligence&quot;. In 1846 Baku (Bibi-Heybat settlement) featured the first ever well drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration. In 1878 Ludvig Nobel and his Branobel company &quot;revolutionized oil transport&quot; by commissioning the first oil tanker and launching it on the Caspian Sea.

Samuel Kier established America&#x27;s first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street in 1853. Ignacy Łukasiewicz built one of the first modern oil-refineries near Jasło (then in the Austrian dependent Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in Central European Galicia), present-day Poland, in 1854–56. Galician refineries were initially small, as demand for refined fuel was limited. The refined products were used in artificial asphalt, machine oil and lubricants, in addition to Łukasiewicz&#x27;s kerosene lamp. As kerosene lamps gained popularity, the refining industry grew in the area.

The first commercial oil-well in Canada became operational in 1858 at Oil Springs, Ontario (then Canada West). Businessman James Miller Williams dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground. Williams extracted 1.5 million litres of crude oil by 1860, refining much of it into kerosene-lamp oil. Some historians challenge Canada&#x27;s claim to North America&#x27;s first oil field, arguing that Pennsylvania&#x27;s famous Drake Well was the continent&#x27;s first. But there is evidence to support Williams, not least of which is that the Drake well did not come into production until August 28, 1859. The controversial point might be that Williams found oil above bedrock while Edwin Drake&#x27;s well located oil within a bedrock reservoir. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Canada&#x27;s first gusher (flowing well) erupted on January 16, 1862, when local oil-man John Shaw struck oil at 158 feet (48 m). For a week the oil gushed unchecked at levels reported as high as 3,000 barrels per day.

The first modern oil-drilling in the United States began in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in the 1850s. Edwin Drake&#x27;s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, typically considered the first true modern oil well, touched off a major boom. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the United States overtook Russia as the world&#x27;s largest oil producer. By the 1920s, oil fields had been established in many countries including Canada, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, the United States, Peru and Venezuela.

The first successful oil tanker, the &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, was built in 1878 in Sweden, designed by Ludvig Nobel. It operated from Baku to Astrakhan. A number of new tanker designs developed in the 1880s.

In the early 1930s the Texas Company developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1937 Pure Oil Company (now part of Chevron Corporation) and its partner Superior Oil Company (now part of ExxonMobil Corporation) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water, one mile (1.6 km) offshore of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. In early 1947 Superior Oil erected a drilling/production oil-platform in of water some 18 miles off Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum (ConocoPhillips) and Stanolind Oil &amp; Gas (BP), completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in November 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee&#x27;s Gulf of Mexico well, Kermac No. 16, the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land. Forty-four Gulf of Mexico exploratory wells discovered 11 oil and natural gas fields by the end of 1949.

During World War II (1939–1945) control of oil supply from Romania, Baku, the Middle East and the Dutch East Indies played a huge role in the events of the war and the ultimate victory of the Allies. The Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (1941) secured Allied control of oil-production in the Middle East. The expansion of Imperial Japan to the south aimed largely at accessing the oil-fields of the Dutch East Indies. Germany, cut off from sea-borne oil supplies by Allied blockade, failed in Operation Edelweiss to secure the Caucasus oil-fields for the Axis military in 1942, while Romania deprived the Wehrmacht of access to Ploesti oilfields – the largest in Europe – from August 1944. Cutting off the East Indies oil-supply (especially via submarine campaigns) considerably weakened Japan in the latter part of the war. After World War II ended in 1945, the countries of the Middle East took the lead in oil production from the United States. Important developments since World War II include deep-water drilling, the introduction of the drillship, and the growth of a global shipping network for petroleum – relying upon oil tankers and pipelines. In 1949 the first offshore oil-drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons. In the 1960s and 1970s, multi-governmental organizations of oil–producing nations – OPEC and OAPEC – played a major role in setting petroleum prices and policy. Oil spills and their cleanup have become an issue of increasing political, environmental, and economic importance. New fields of hydrocarbon production developed in places such as Siberia, Sakhalin, Venezuela and North and West Africa.

With the advent of hydraulic fracturing and other horizontal drilling techniques, shale play has seen an enormous uptick in production. Areas of shale such as the Permian Basin and Eagle-Ford have become huge hotbeds of production for the largest oil corporations in the United States.

==Structure==

The American Petroleum Institute divides the petroleum industry into five sectors:

* upstream (exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas)
* downstream (oil tankers, refiners, retailers and consumers)
* pipeline
* marine
* service and supply

===Upstream===
Oil companies used to be classified by sales as &quot;supermajors&quot; (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Shell, Eni and TotalEnergies), &quot;&quot;majors&quot;,&quot; and &quot;&quot;independents&quot; or &quot;jobbers&quot;.&quot; In recent years however, National Oil Companies (NOC, as opposed to IOC, International Oil Companies) have come to control the rights over the largest oil reserves; by this measure the top ten companies all are NOC. The following table shows the ten largest national oil companies ranked by reserves and by production in 2012.

Most upstream work in the oil field or on an oil well is contracted out to drilling contractors and oil field service companies.

Aside from the NOCs which dominate the Upstream sector, there are many international companies that have a market share. For example:
* BG Group
* BHP
* ConocoPhillips
* Chevron
* Eni
* ExxonMobil
* First Texas Energy Corporation
* Hess
* Marathon Oil
* OMV
* TotalEnergies
* Tullow Oil
* Rosneft

===Midstream===

Midstream operations are sometimes classified within the downstream sector, but these operations compose a separate and discrete sector of the petroleum industry. Midstream operations and processes include the following:
* Gathering: The gathering process employs narrow, low-pressure pipelines to connect oil- and gas-producing wells to larger, long-haul pipelines or processing facilities.
* Processing/refining: Processing and refining operations turn crude oil and gas into marketable products. In the case of crude oil, these products include heating oil, gasoline for use in vehicles, jet fuel, and diesel oil. Oil refining processes include distillation, vacuum distillation, catalytic reforming, catalytic cracking, alkylation, isomerization and hydrotreating. Natural gas processing includes compression; glycol dehydration; amine treating; separating the product into pipeline-quality natural gas and a stream of mixed natural gas liquids; and fractionation, which separates the stream of mixed natural gas liquids into its components. The fractionation process yields ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.
* Transportation: Oil and gas are transported to processing facilities, and from there to end users, by pipeline, tanker/barge, truck, and rail. Pipelines are the most economical transportation method and are most suited to movement across longer distances, for example, across continents. Tankers and barges are also employed for long-distance, often international transport. Rail and truck can also be used for longer distances but are most cost-effective for shorter routes.
* Storage: Midstream service providers provide storage facilities at terminals throughout the oil and gas distribution systems. These facilities are most often located near refining and processing facilities and are connected to pipeline systems to facilitate shipment when product demand must be met. While petroleum products are held in storage tanks, natural gas tends to be stored in underground facilities, such as salt dome caverns and depleted reservoirs.
* Technological applications: Midstream service providers apply technological solutions to improve efficiency during midstream processes. Technology can be used during compression of fuels to ease flow through pipelines; to better detect leaks in pipelines; and to automate communications for better pipeline and equipment monitoring.

While some upstream companies carry out certain midstream operations, the midstream sector is dominated by a number of companies that specialize in these services. Midstream companies include:
* Aux Sable
* Bridger Group
* DCP Midstream Partners
* Enbridge Energy Partners
* Enterprise Products Partners
* Genesis Energy
* Gibson Energy
* Inergy Midstream
* Kinder Morgan Energy Partners
* Oneok Partners
* Plains All American
* Sunoco Logistics
* Targa Midstream Services
* Targray Natural Gas Liquids
* TransCanada
* Williams Companies

==Social impact==
The oil and gas industry spends only 0.4% of its net sales on research &amp; development (R&amp;D) which is in comparison with a range of other industries the lowest share. Governments such as the United States government provide a heavy public subsidy to petroleum companies, with major tax breaks at various stages of oil exploration and extraction, including the costs of oil field leases and drilling equipment. In recent years, enhanced oil recovery techniques – most notably multi-stage drilling and hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;) – have moved to the forefront of the industry as this new technology plays a crucial and controversial role in new methods of oil extraction.

== Environmental impact ==
=== Water pollution ===
Some petroleum industry operations have been responsible for water pollution through by-products of refining and oil spills. Though hydraulic fracturing has significantly increased natural gas extraction, there is some belief and evidence to support that consumable water has seen increased in methane contamination due to this gas extraction. Leaks from underground tanks and abandoned refineries may also contaminate groundwater in surrounding areas. Hydrocarbons that comprise refined petroleum are resistant to biodegradation and have been found to remain present in contaminated soils for years. To hasten this process, bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants is often employed by means of aerobic degradation. More recently, other bioremediative methods have been explored such as phytoremediation and thermal remediation.

=== Air pollution ===
The industry is the largest industrial source of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a group of chemicals that contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone (smog). The combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants as by-products. Pollutants include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and heavy metals.

Researchers have discovered that the petrochemical industry can produce ground-level ozone pollution at higher amounts in winter than in summer.

=== Climate change ===
Greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuels drive climate change. In 1959, at a symposium organised by the American Petroleum Institute for the centennial of the American oil industry, the physicist Edward Teller warned of the danger of global climate change. Edward Teller explained that carbon dioxide &quot;in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect&quot; and that burning more fossil fuels could &quot;melt the icecaps and submerge New York&quot;.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, founded by the United Nations in 1988, concludes that human-sourced greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the twentieth century.

As a result of climate change concerns, many people have begun using other methods of energy such as solar and wind. This recent shift has some petroleum enthusiasts skeptical about the future of the industry.

<text>In electoral systems, voter registration (or enrollment) is the requirement that a person otherwise eligible to vote must register (or enroll) on an electoral roll, which is usually a prerequisite for being entitled or permitted to vote.

The rules governing registration vary between jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, registration is an automatic process performed by extracting the names of voting age residents of a precinct from a general-use population registry ahead of election day. In contrast, in others, registration may require an application being made by an eligible voter and registered persons to re-register or update registration details when they change residence or other relevant information changes.

Some jurisdictions have &quot;election day registration&quot; and others do not require registration, or may require the production of evidence of entitlement to vote at the time of voting. In jurisdictions where registration is not mandatory, an effort may be made to encourage persons otherwise eligible to vote to register, in what is called as a voter registration drive. In countries where resident registration is compulsory, voter registration usually does not exist, since voter eligibility can be determined from the residence register.

Even in countries where registration is the individual&#x27;s responsibility, many reformers, seeking to maximize voter turnout, argue for a wider availability of the required forms, or more ease of process by having more places where they can register. In the United States, for example, the &quot;National Voter Registration Act of 1993&quot; (&quot;Motor Voter Law&quot;) and similar laws require states to offer voter registration at motor vehicle departments (driver&#x27;s license offices) as well as disability centers, public schools, and public libraries, in order to offer more access to the system. State authorities are also required to accept mail-in voter registrations. Many jurisdictions also offer online registrations.

The strictest system is in the Bahamas, resulting in the electorate being a little more than half of adult citizenry.

==By country==
Systems of voter registration vary widely from country to country, and sometimes among lower jurisdictions, such as states or provinces. In some nations, voters are automatically added to the rolls when they reach legal voting age. In others, potential voters are required to apply to be added to the rolls.

===Australia===

Voter registration is compulsory in Australia for all citizens 18 years of age or above. The Australian Electoral Commission maintains Australia&#x27;s federal electoral roll. Each state also has its own electoral commission or office, but voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission.

===Belgium===

Before an election, each municipality compiles a list of eligible voters based on the digital and continuously updated National Register (the database of all citizens). The authorities automatically send a voter invitation card to each voter before an election.

However, non-citizens do have to register if they wish to vote. Generally, fewer than 20% of eligible non-citizens do so.

===Canada===
In Canada, the National Register of Electors is a continuously updated permanent database of eligible electors for federal elections in Canada maintained by Elections Canada. In the 1990s Canada adopted an opt-in process, by which voters mark their consent to be added the national register on their annual income tax returns.

The Register is also updated using the following sources:
* provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars
* Canada Revenue Agency
* Citizenship and Immigration Canada
* provincial and territorial vital statistics registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent lists of electors (e.g. British Columbia and Quebec)
* information supplied by electors when they register to vote or revise their information during and between federal electoral events
* proven electoral lists from other Canadian jurisdictions

Same-day registration is also permitted.

===Chile===
Since 2012, voter registration in Chile is automatic. It is based on a database by the Civil Registry Office of Chileans and resident foreigners in possession of an identity card number, which is unique for each individual when issued and is never re-used after a person&#x27;s death. All Chileans and eligible foreigners are added automatically to the electoral roll at age 17 and placed on an electoral constituency based on their last reported address with the Office. That address, known as &quot;electoral domicile,&quot; can be different from a person&#x27;s living address, if so desired. The electoral roll may contain a substantial number of persons residing abroad. Residents abroad are not allowed to vote in Chilean elections.

===Czech Republic===
All citizens and residents are included in the national register. Each person is assigned a personal identification number that includes the person&#x27;s date of birth and is divisible by 11.

===Denmark===
All citizens and residents of Denmark are included in the national register, &quot;Det Centrale Personregister.&quot; Each person is assigned a personal number of ten digits, which include the person&#x27;s date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system, official record of residence, and other purposes. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place; it may only be presented at the designated local polling station. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while long-time residents may vote in local and regional elections. Permanent address within Denmark is required in order to vote. Voting is voluntary.

===Estonia===
Every citizen has a personal identification code assigned since birth. Every citizen becomes automatically eligible to vote the day they turn 18. No special notifications are sent and voting is not compulsory. Everyone older than 16 who is a permanent resident (whether a citizen of Estonia, EU, or other) can vote in local elections depending on where they have registered their official residence. 

===Finland===
Voter registration in Finland is automatic and based on the national population register. Each citizen is assigned an identification number at birth. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the process of moving residence very simple. Close to election time, the government mails a notification to registered persons informing them of the election and where and when to cast their votes. Only citizens may vote in national elections, but all residents may vote in local elections.

===Germany===
In Germany, there is no separate voter registration, as resident registration is compulsory.

All permanent residents of Germany are required to register their place of residence (or the fact that they are homeless) with local government. Citizens who will be 18 or older on the day of voting automatically receive a notification card in the mail some weeks before any election in which they are eligible to vote: for local elections, resident citizens of other EU countries will also receive these cards and may vote. Polling places have lists of all eligible voters resident in the neighborhood served by the particular station; the voter&#x27;s notification card (or photo ID such as an identity card or passport if the notification card is not at hand) is checked against these lists before individuals receive a ballot. Voting is not compulsory.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong all permanent residents who are above 18 years of age and do not suffer from a mental illness can register as voters. Imprisoned people can also register and vote since the laws prohibiting them from voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2009 and are able to vote since mid-2010 as the electoral roll is updated annually. The registration process is voluntary. In 2002 around 1.6 million permanent residents did not register.

===Iceland===
All citizens of Iceland are registered in a central database at birth, which is maintained by Registers Iceland. They do not need to register separately to vote.

===India===
The Government of India conducts a revision of the voters list every 5 years. An additional summary revision is conducted every year. Apart from this, citizens can request their inclusion in the voters list by applying through Form 6. If the application is valid, the applicant&#x27;s name will get included in the list. At 18 years old, completed person should be eligible for voter list (for Indian citizens only).

===Israel===
In Israel, all citizens who are 18 years of age or older on election day are automatically registered to vote.

===Italy===
In Italy, all municipalities have a registry of residents and a registry of eligible voters. This is revised every six months and whenever there is an election. The registry of eligible voters can be viewed by anyone to ensure maximum transparency in the electoral process. All citizens aged 18 or more on the election day are automatically registered to vote.

=== Kazakhstan ===
In Kazakhstan, voter registration for general elections is conducted by local executive bodies (akimats). Citizens aged 18 and above can register to vote at their relevant akimats upon announcement or appointment of elections, provided they provide their identification number. Verification of inclusion or correctness of data in the electoral roll can be done 15 days before election day at corresponding election commission premises. Special arrangements are made for voter registration in various locations, with different timelines depending on the type of election and location.

Absentee voting requires notifying the akimat of a new residence at least thirty days before the election, while citizens abroad must register with their foreign precinct election commission using a valid Kazakhstani passport.

===Mexico===
Mexico has a general electoral census. Any citizen of age 18 or greater must go to an electoral office in order be registered into the electoral census. Citizens receive a voting card (&quot;credencial de elector con fotografía&quot;), issued by the National Electoral Institute (INE) (from 1990 until 4/2014 it was called Federal Electoral Institute) that must be shown to vote in any election. The voting card also serves as a national identity document.

===Netherlands===
No separate voter registration: all eligible voters receive an invitation with a poll card using the national Civil registration (Basic Registry of Persons). Voters must present a valid ID that has not expired for more than 5 years at the polling station. Eligibility varies depending on the type of election. For national and provincial elections, only Dutch civilians are permitted to vote, while for European Parliament elections one has to have the nationality of an EU member state.
In municipal elections, eligibility is dependent on the place of residency on nomination day, with non-EU nationals also having voting rights when they have been living in the Netherlands legally for five years or more.

===Norway===
There is no separate voter registration: All eligible voters can automatically vote. Citizens and residents of Norway are included in the national register, &quot;Folkeregisteret&quot;, where each person is assigned a personal number of eleven digits which include the person&#x27;s date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system and other purposes, and it is maintained by the tax authorities. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address, no sooner than 31 days before, and no later than 8 days after a change of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities), making the process of moving residence very simple. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place. Voters are assigned to a district based on the official address of residence per 30 June in the election year. Elections are normally held the 2nd Monday of September. Voters may vote early in any district in the country, usually at City Hall or similar, or in embassies and consulates abroad. Early voting starts in July, and ends about a week before election day. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while longtime residents may vote in local and regional elections. Voting is not compulsory.

===Peru===
All citizens of Peru between 18 and 70 years are registered to vote through the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status, except all members of the police and the armed forces, who are not allowed to participate in elections. For all citizens in the country and abroad voting is mandatory, unless legally exempted. Failing to vote in the election of 7 Oct 2018 was fined with S/ 83, with 50% or 75% discount for areas with poverty or extreme poverty, and this must be paid to get access to many public services.

===Philippines===
Filipino citizens who are at least 18 years of age are eligible to register to vote. A voter’s ID is issued if the requirements are met. In 2022, there were 1.7 million registered voters living overseas who were eligible to vote in national elections.

===South Korea===
There is no formal process for voter registration for South Korean citizens. All citizens will be automatically listed in the voters&#x27; list upon each election date. A domestic in-absentee vote was ceased and citizens can visit any residents&#x27; center (주민센터) and vote in advance during the weekend before the actual election date.

However, citizens either temporary visiting or permanently residing abroad must register for an overseas in-absentee ballot in order to vote. Voting can be done in Korean overseas missions.

===Spain===
No registration is required: all Spanish citizens of voting age are listed in the electoral roll through the National Statistics Institute&#x27;s Electoral Census Office. Only citizens may vote in national and regional elections, while foreign residents may vote in local elections upon a reciprocity basis. Citizens from other European Union countries may also vote in European elections. Certain convicted felons are disenfranchised while serving their sentences, but their voting rights are automatically restored afterwards without exception. Most prisoners are not disenfranchised and can vote by mail as absentees.

All eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address prior to election Sunday showing the date, time and local polling place, which is almost invariably the nearest school or the town hall in very small towns without a school. Polling may also be done at a Spanish diplomatic mission if residing overseas. All absentee and early voting ballots are sent physically to the registered local polling station for counting and double checking the voter&#x27;s identity with the electoral roll eliminating any risk of double voting. Government-issued ID is required to vote. Voting is not compulsory.

===Sweden===
Voter registration in Sweden is automatic and based on the national population register, Folkbokföringsregistret, administered by the Swedish Tax Agency, where all citizens and residents of Sweden are included. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens but enjoy right of residence, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register.

Only Swedish citizens being 18 years old on the election day and living in Sweden may vote in all public elections. Registered residents may vote in local and regional elections if they are citizens of another EU Member State, Iceland or Norway. Citizens of other countries and stateless persons can vote in the municipal and county elections if they have been recorded in the Swedish Population Register for at least three consecutive years before election day. Swedish citizens that are resident abroad have the right to vote in Riksdag and EU elections only. To maintain a record in the electoral roll as an expatriate, one needs to refresh the registration within 10 years; a vote counts as a valid refresh.

All eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address of 30 days prior to election day, in Sweden or abroad, which shows the date (always on a Sunday, normally in September every 4 years), time and local polling place. Polling may also be done anywhere in the country at various early voting stations determined by the local election commission or at a Swedish diplomatic mission, all to facilitate for the voters.

===Switzerland===
===Taiwan===

All citizens of Taiwan are registered in a national database at birth, which is maintained by the Household Registration Office and the Central Election Commission of Taiwan. Taiwanese citizens do not need to register separately to vote, whereas all citizens above twenty years old will be automatically informed by postal mail from the government few weeks before every public election.

===Turkey===

All citizens will be automatically listed in the voters&#x27; list upon each election date. Domestic and overseas registers are composed in competence with data taken from the Address Registration System (AKS) of the General Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality. Citizens may control whether they are registered in domestic or overseas electoral registers by visiting the website of the Supreme Election Council or the e-Government.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK voter registration is compulsory, but the requirement to register is rarely enforced. The 2023 system of registration in the United Kingdom (UK), is known as rolling registration. Electors can register with a local authority at any time of the year. This replaced the twice-yearly census of electors, which often disenfranchised those who had moved during the interval between censuses.

Across the country, the registration of electors is still technically the responsibility of the head of household, a concept which some consider to be anachronistic in modern society. As of 2023, the system is controversial, as it is possible for one person to delete persons who live with them from the electoral roll. As of January 2012, mandatory individual registration, pursuant to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, was anticipated.

A feasibility study for electronic individual voter registration (IVR), based on the experience of other nations, was undertaken by EURIM (Information Society Alliance) in 2010. The final report was released in 2011. According to the House of Commons Hansard from 16 January 2012, the IVR initiative is yet to be implemented in the UK. There was discussion of data from Northern Ireland, where individual voter registration levels significantly decreased following the introduction of an IVR policy.

In an experiment in Northern Ireland using personal identifiers, such as National Insurance numbers and signatures, the number of registered electors fell by some ten thousand. It was also understood that the new process may have resulted in fictitious voters being dropped from rolls.

Registration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341) and violators are liable on summary conviction and face a maximum fine of £1,000. Voters must be on the electoral roll in order to vote in national or local elections. A fixed address is required in order for an individual to vote in an election. To provide for persons who are transient, if an individual lacking a fixed address wants to vote, they may register by filling in a &#x27;Declaration of local connection&#x27; form. This establishes a connection to the area based on the last fixed address someone had, or the place where they spend a substantial amount of their time (e.g. a homeless shelter).

A voting card is sent to each registrant shortly before any elections. The individual does not need to take the card to the polling station, instead it serves to remind individuals of the details they had provided to the electoral register.

===United States===


In the United States, states generally require voter registration, with North Dakota being the only state which has no registration requirement. Some U.S. states do not require advance registration, instead allowing voters to register when they arrive at the polls, in what is called &quot;same day registration&quot; (SDR) or &quot;election day registration&quot; (EDR).

Same-day registration (SDR) has been linked to higher voter turn-out, with SDR states reporting average turn-out of 71% in the 2012 United States Presidential election, well above the average voter turn-out rate of 59% for non-SDR states.

Voter registration in the United States takes place at the county or municipality level, and is a prerequisite to voting at federal, state and local elections. The only exception is North Dakota, although North Dakota law allows cities to register voters for city elections.

A 2012 study by The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that 24% of the voting-eligible population in the United States are not registered to vote, a percentage that represents &quot;at least 51 million eligible U.S. citizens.&quot; Numerous states had a history of creating barriers to voter registration through a variety of fees, literacy or comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements that in practice discriminated against racial or ethnic minorities, language minorities, and other groups. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 forbade such abuses and authorized federal oversight in jurisdictions of historic under-representation of certain groups. States continue to develop new practices that may discriminate against certain populations. By August 2016, federal rulings in five cases have overturned all or parts of voter registration or voter ID laws in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota that were found to place undue burden on minorities and other groups among voters. The states were required to offer alternatives for the November 2016 elections; many of these cases were expected to reach the US Supreme Court for additional hearings.

While voters traditionally had to register at government offices by a certain period before an election, in the mid-1990s, the federal government made efforts to simplify registration procedures to improve access and increase turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the &quot;Motor Voter&quot; law) required state governments to &quot;either&quot; provide uniform opt-in registration services through drivers&#x27; license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration, &quot;or&quot; to allow voter registration on Election Day, where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting. 

Political parties and other organizations sometimes hold voter registration drives, organized efforts to register groups of new voters.

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) as an independent, bipartisan commission offers to help election officials improve the administration of elections and help United States citizens participate in the voting process. The EAC is the official government agency that is a resource for voting registration questions.

<text>Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park is a park located in the Sierra Pelona in northern Los Angeles County, California. It is known for its rock formations, the result of sedimentary layering and later seismic uplift. It is located near the town of Agua Dulce, between the cities of Santa Clarita and Palmdale. The area is visible from the Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14). Its location approximately from downtown Los Angeles places it within Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;studio zone&quot; and makes it a popular filming location for films and television programs.

==History==
These rock formations were formed by rapid erosion during uplift about 25 million years ago, and then later exposed by uplift activity along the San Andreas Fault.

The Tataviam people were living here when the Spanish arrived and still live in the region, with a modern tribal government. The village of Mapipinga was located here. Their language was most likely a Takic Uto-Aztecan language. They lived in grass huts within villages. With the coming of the Spanish missions, some of these people were forced to work there. They eventually began speaking Spanish and inter-marrying with other tribes.

In 1874, Tiburcio Vásquez, one of California&#x27;s most notorious Mexican &quot;bandidos&quot;, used these rocks to elude capture by law enforcement. His name has since been associated with this geologic feature.

The land and rock formations were acquired gradually by Los Angeles County, beginning with a donation of 40 acres in 1971, with more parcels being added through 2001. The Pacific Crest Trail crosses through the park.

Vasquez Rocks was added to the National Register of Historic Places (site #72000228) in 1972 because of its significance as a prehistoric site for the Shoshone and Tataviam peoples.

==Formation==
Literature reviews have dated the earliest sedimentation of the Vasquez Formation occurring between the later portion of the Oligocene Epoch to the lower Miocene Epoch, each respectively 33.9-23 million years ago and 23.03-5.3 million years ago.

The Vasquez Formation resides within the Soledad Basin, an orthogonal rift between the Sierra Pelona Mountains to the northwest and the San Gabriel Mountains to the east, which are both within the province of the Transverse Mountain Range of Southern California. The San Andreas Fault runs parallel behind the Sierra Pelona Mountains and separates the formation from the North American Plate.

The Vasquez Formation consists of alluvial sediments that eroded from the Sierra Pelona and San Gabriel Mountains and were deposited in alluvial fans on both sides of the Soledad Basin. Erosion of the sediment included processes like rain, floods, wind, and earthquakes. Over the course of millions of years, the sediment was laid down under alternating lacustrine and fluviatile conditions. Once laid flat across the basin floor, immense pressure converted the layers into sandstone, which became covered with younger sediment deposits. The sediment beds reside in a sharply folded syncline.

Due to its proximity to the San Andreas Fault, tectonic activity has been an important factor in the reshaping, uplift, and exposure of the buried sandstone. The Elkhorn Fault, an offshoot of the San Andreas Fault, runs through the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. Other faults, such as the Pelona, Vasquez Canyon, Soledad, and San Gabriel Faults, are all within proximity of the formation. The most exposed portion of the Vasquez Formation is the oldest tertiary formation within the east portion of the Ventura Basin.

The Vasquez Rocks consist mainly of coarse-grained conglomerate and breccia sediments, which were deposited adjacent to active faults during rapid uplift and consequent erosion of the San Gabriel Mountains. Approximately 25 million years ago (late Oligocene time), the collision of the North American and Pacific tectonic plates uplifted the area along the Elkhorn Fault. Energetic erosion of the highland along with uplift and volcanism caused debris flow sediments to be distributed in alluvial fans into a rapidly subsiding rift known as the Soledad Basin. These sediments were buried and lithified through the Miocene and became exposed more recently via activity along the San Andreas Fault system. The strata are now highly tilted and disconnected from their source area. The strata were deformed and offset by the later fault activity. The distinctive hogback ridges of steeply inclined strata serve to graphically demonstrate the significant fault activity in the area. It is possible to see the extreme variance in grain size between layers of sediment where the strata are exposed. These sedimentary rocks, named the Mint Canyon Formation, were laid down about 8-15 million years ago. In the upper layers, many animal fossils have been found, including camels, horses and rodents.

Soil surveyors mapped much of the park as &quot;Rock Land&quot; with no soil cover; where soil exists the dominant series is Gaviota gravelly loam which ranges from 6 to 20 inches thick.

==Ecology==

The ecology of the park is characteristic of the California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The park is primarily covered in short grasses, scrub oak trees, California junipers, yucca, and other chaparral shrubs such as California sagebrush and California buckwheat.

==Role in entertainment==

The park&#x27;s visually interesting terrain and proximity to Hollywood have made it a frequently used filming location since the 1930s. As it was within the studio zone, union actors and crew could be asked to work there without producers needing to pay extra. Producer Stanley Bergerman chose it to represent Tibet in the film &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1935). It became popular as a setting in Westerns in the 1940s and 1950s, followed by numerous television series.

The prominent rock formation is featured as fictional alien settings in four episodes of the original late 1960s &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, from which it gained the nickname &quot;Kirk&#x27;s Rock&quot;. The location was subsequently used the same way in the films &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986) and &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), and episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; features scenes set and filmed at Vasquez Rocks, making it the first time the rocks have been seen as themselves in the franchise. &quot;Futurama&quot; pays homage to its usage in &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the episode &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;, in which most of the original series actors and broadcast tapes are transported to an alien planet whose landscape prominently features rocks modeled after those at Vasquez.

<text>Zeus is a fictional deity, appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is based on the god Zeus in Greek mythology.

Russell Crowe portrays Zeus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot;.

==Publication history==

The comic version of Zeus is based on the god of the same name from Greek mythology. Zeus first appears in &quot;Venus&quot; #5 (June 1949), and was adapted by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
Zeus is the youngest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, the children of sky god Ouranos and elder goddess Gaea (also known as &quot;Mother Earth&quot;). The infant Zeus was secretly entrusted to his grandmother Gaea for safekeeping and hidden in the Caves of Dicte on Crete&#x27;s Aegean Hill.

After the Hyborian Age, the ancient Greek civilization began to rise, so Zeus made the Olympian gods known to them to gain their worship. During the war of Troy, Zeus battled Thor who had accidentally been transported there. Hades deplored Zeus&#x27; decree, and challenged Zeus&#x27; supremacy many times.

Zeus breaks up a fight between Hercules and Thor with his thunderbolt, but cannot break Hercules&#x27; contract with Pluto.

Zeus later battles Amatsu-Mikaboshi, who had kidnapped Ares&#x27; son Alexander, and is seemingly killed. During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, the spirit of Zeus is revealed to have been captured by Pluto, and held in Hades. After being put on trial, Zeus willingly drinks from the River Lethe, making him lose his memory and renounce his crown to Pluto.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Zeus, Hera, and Ares are among the dead characters that Pluto releases to help defend the underworld from Amatsu-Mikaboshi. After Hercules defeats Amatsu-Mikaboshi, he restores Zeus along with the rest of the universe.

While sleeping with another woman, Zeus was depowered by Hera because of his infidelity and womanizing. He regains his powers after helping Hercules defeat Baba Yaga, a witch who absorbs the magic of the artifacts to regain her youth.

Following the events of &quot;Avengers: No Surrender&quot;, Nyx escapes imprisonment and kills the Olympians, including Zeus.

Zeus is once again reborn, with a much more aggressive and belligerent attitude, thanks to the eternal cosmic cycle of death and rebirth. He leads his fellow gods in a war of conquest and destruction, until they are stopped by the Guardians of the Galaxy.

Zeus clashes with Thor once again thanks to the manipulations of Loki, going so far as to fight alongside Nyx in an effort to get his revenge. Despite this, he is outmatched by the Allfather-empowered Norse god, and has his energies drained by Thor.

==Reception==
* In 2019, Comic Book Resources (CBR) ranked Zeus 2nd in their &quot;Marvel Comics: The 10 Most Powerful Olympians&quot; list.
* In 2021, CBR ranked Zeus 2nd in their &quot;Marvel: 10 Most Powerful Olympians&quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;Sportskeeda&quot; ranked Zeus 3rd in their &quot;10 best Greek gods from Marvel comics &quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Zeus in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Olympian Gods In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

<text>Robinson, formerly Expedition Robinson, is a Swedish reality game show and the original version of the international &quot;Survivor&quot; format.

The television show places a group of strangers in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. They are initially divided into two tribes. The contestants compete in challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination. The remaining contestants are eventually merged into a single tribe. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants or, as may be the result after the merge, lose an immunity challenge until only one remains and is awarded the grand prize.

The format was developed in 1994 by Charlie Parsons for a United Kingdom TV production company called Planet 24, but the Swedish debut in 1997 was the first production to actually make it to television. The show was a success, and plans for international versions were made. An American version called &quot;Survivor&quot; started in 2000.

==Format==
The name alludes to both &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, two stories featuring people marooned by shipwrecks.

Twelve to 20 contestants are put into a survival situation and compete in a variety of physical challenges. Early in each season two teams compete but later on the teams are merged and the competitions become individual. Contestants are eliminated through tribal councils and, after merging, losing immunity challenges until the final challenge where the winner wins the competition.

==Ownership==
Planet 24 was owned by Charlie Parsons and Bob Geldof. Their company Castaway Television Productions retained the rights to the concept when they sold Planet 24 in 1999. In July 2017, Banijay Group acquired Castaway Television Productions.

<text>Warlords is a video game series created by Steve Fawkner, in which role-playing elements are combined with turn-based strategy in a fantasy setting. The series began with &quot;Warlords&quot; in 1990 and includes three other games, two expansion packs, and several spinoffs. Gameplay centers around key elements such as units, heroes, cities, and diplomacy, with players managing resources, engaging in combat, and navigating political relationships. Over time, the series introduced new mechanics like hero recruitment, city conquest, and advanced diplomatic systems. Notable spin-offs include Warlords Battlecry and Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords.

== Gameplay ==
The central aspects of &quot;Warlords&quot; game series are &quot;units&quot;, &quot;heroes&quot;, &quot;cities&quot; and &quot;diplomacy&quot;.

=== Units ===
Units are the expendable resource in &quot;Warlords&quot;, produced and/or purchased in all active cities. Units come in different types such as light infantry, archers, elephants, and even mythological creatures such as minotaurs and unicorns. All units in &quot;Warlords&quot; have several standard properties: strength, distance of movement per turn, cost, and upkeep. Some have additional special abilities such as flying, bonuses to defense or combat, or traversing difficult terrain without hindrances. Since the introduction of &quot;Warlords III&quot;, units also have hit points.

Allies are a special type of unit only found by searching ruins or hidden temples. Allies are relatively powerful compared to regular units, do not require upkeep, and often include one or more special abilities. Allies include units such as wizards, dragons, devils, and archons (angels). Some versions of the game, such as &quot;Warlords II&quot;, have an option to allow cities to produce allies like regular units. In this case, the allies require upkeep and have a production cost.

=== Heroes ===
Heroes are a special type of unit with a unique set of properties and special abilities:

* &quot;Possess items&quot; - Heroes may pick up items found in ruins or in hidden tombs. These items increase the hero&#x27;s or his stack combat abilities, player income, or the ability to cast spells (&quot;Warlords III&quot;);
* &quot;Search ruins and hidden tombs&quot; - Heroes may search ruins and hidden tombs to fight a special enemy unit. If successful, the hero is rewarded with money, items, or allies;
* &quot;Receive and complete a quest&quot; - A hero may receive a quest from a temple, whereupon completion results in a reward of money, items, or allies. Only one hero at a time may be on a quest;
* &quot;Cast spells&quot; - Starting with &quot;Warlords III&quot;, heroes may gain the ability to cast spells.
* &quot;Experience Points&quot; - Heroes are the only units to gain experience points by killing enemy units, conquering cities, and completing quests. More experience results in higher levels, up to a maximum of level 5 (except in &quot;Warlords IV&quot;) increasing the unit&#x27;s combat abilities and movement per level. In &quot;Warlords IV&quot; the player may keep three units from each battle as a personal retinue. This creates a replayability within the game and allows the player to obtain very high levels with each of the units held in the retinue (well above level 5).

Each player begins play with a level 1 hero at the start of the game. Unlike other units, additional heroes cannot be produced by cities or discovered in ruins or hidden tombs. The only way to gain a new hero is to accept an offer in exchange for money. Newly hired heroes often come with allies. Heroes have the potential to be the most powerful unit in the game.

=== Cities ===
The game flow of &quot;Warlords&quot; typically involves capturing the cities. The default winning condition is to conquer most of the cities on the map.

The cities are the main source of new units in the game. Up to four different units can be available in a single city with an ability for player to &quot;buy production&quot; — to replace the currently available units with others at some initial cost. Once the player owning the city orders production of a unit, the city will provide new units of a kind until another order is issued. The production may be forwarded from one city to another, allowing the player to concentrate armies on the borderline or in another location of strategic interest.

The cities also serve a defense purpose: the defenders of a city enjoy the &quot;city bonus&quot;, which increases armies&#x27; strength. Several units have the special ability to cancel the city bonus.

After capturing a city, the player has a choice whether to occupy, pillage, sack or raze it. Once razed, the city cannot be rebuilt. Sacking the city removes all the production options returning the player half of their cost. Pillaging the city results in removal of some production options (those being the most expensive units in &quot;Warlords&quot; and &quot;Warlords II&quot;, and the units a player cannot produce in &quot;Warlords III&quot;).

=== Diplomacy ===
The relations between the players are regulated by the diplomacy: the players should declare wars before actually engaging their armies in battles. While there is a possibility to attack another player without prior negotiations, such behavior may be followed by unilateral declaration of war by all other players on a violator.

=== Battles ===
The battles in &quot;Warlords&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Warlords IV&quot;) are non-interactive. The process of battle is shown as two enemy stacks opposing each other; when a unit is killed it disappears from the battle screen. The outcome of the battle is calculated using the units&#x27; abilities and several other factors using a sophisticated algorithm.

== Original series ==
The games of the series are noted for the strong AI.

The games are set in the fantasy world of Etheria, and tend to be based around the traditional premise of good versus evil, with neutrality in between. Heroes on the side of good are the Sirian Knights, the mercantile Empires of Men, the elves and the dwarves. On the side of evil are the demonic horsemen: the Lord of Plague, the Lord of Famine, the Lord of War, and the ever present Lord Bane, Lord of Death.

The politics of the world, however, are more complicated than they first appear, particularly in the third installment of the series. For example, the Minotaurs, who were created as servants for Sartek, the Lord of War, are a neutral race rather than an evil one. Also, the third game opens with the human Empire pillaging and exploiting the newly discovered lands of the peaceful Srrathi snakemen, in an obvious nod to the historical European conquest of the Americas. Most importantly from a player&#x27;s point of view, a Hero&#x27;s race is not as important in determining his or her moral alignment as is his or her choice of class. For example, while the Undead are evil as a rule, an Undead Paladin would be treated as good (though such a thing is only possible in the third game, wherein all previous restrictions on race and class combinations have been removed).

=== Warlords ===

The first game in the series, &quot;Warlords&quot;, was created in 1990 by Steven Fawkner and was published by SSG. It featured eight different clans battling for the control of the mythical land of Illuria: Sirians, Storm Giants, Grey Dwarves, Orcs of Kor, Elvallie, Horse Lords, Selentines, and Lord Bane. Each clan could either be controlled by the computer or by a human player, allowing up to eight participants taking turns in hot seat play. Gameplay consisted of moving units, attacking opponent units or cities, adjusting production in cities, and moving hero units to explore ruins, temples, libraries, and to discover allies, relics, and other items. The goal of the game was to conquer the land of Illuria by capturing or razing at least two thirds of the cities in the land.

=== Warlords II ===

Following the success of &quot;Warlords&quot;, SSG released &quot;Warlords II&quot; in 1993. This version included five maps (although the later released mission pack increased the number). Another new feature was &#x27;fog of war&#x27; - optionally, enemy units or even the map could be concealed from players without units close enough to see them. The interface of the game was improved, as were the graphics (with additional unique city graphics for each different player). Moreover, the game featured multiple army, city, and terrain sets (still in 16 colours), play by e-mail as well as hot seat, and a random map generator and map editor.

The updated version of the game — &quot;Warlords II Deluxe&quot; — was released in 1995. It allowed for custom tile, army and city sets for maps and provided support for 256 colours. Thanks to the publication of the editor, &quot;Warlords II Deluxe&quot; led to an increase of user-created content. Many new maps, army and terrain sets, and scenarios were distributed on the Internet for the game.

=== Warlords III ===

After a four-year hiatus, SSG developed &quot;Warlords III: Reign of Heroes&quot;.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and used new system capabilities to dramatically improve graphics:
* animated armies&#x27; movements
* skinnable user interface
* several landscape options
* more advanced city graphics

The heroes acquired the ability to cast spells to receive the temporary benefit. Each spell has its price expressed in mana points, which became the second (after gold) resource in game.

The campaign system also became more advanced: the heroes from the previous game of the campaign followed the user to the new game, keeping their experience and items.

The concept of diplomacy was further refined by adding new state of diplomatic relations: &quot;Treaty&quot;. This state allowed players trespassing each other&#x27;s cities and winning the &quot;Allied victory&quot; exterminating all other parties. Another diplomacy-related feature introduced in &quot;Reign of Heroes&quot; was the ability to bribe enemies, thus influencing their diplomatic decisions. The amount of bribe was fine-tunable; the more substantial bribe was, the greater chances of needed decision were.

In addition to the previously available multiplayer modes (hotseat and play by email) the &quot;Reign of Heroes&quot; introduced the ability to play over network.

Shortly after releasing &quot;Reign of Heroes&quot;, SSG followed with &quot;Warlords III: Darklords Rising&quot; — a stand-alone expansion pack. It featured the new maps and units and contained the sample graphics to facilitate development of alternative tile, army and city sets. The plot of the main campaign continued where the previous game had left off.

&quot;Warlords III&quot; like &quot;Warlords II&quot; had a campaign editor and realistic terrain model.

By the time of Warlords III games&#x27; releases the real-time strategy game genre was in full-swing, so there was less of a market for turn-based games. The oncoming rush of first-person shooters and first generation MMORPGs also did not help the popularity of the series. The turn-based strategy genre in general would take a hit during this period.

=== Warlords IV ===

&quot;Warlords IV&quot;, released in 2003, used pre-rendered 3D sprites for its unit and city graphics and particle graphics for various effects. Despite this, the game had an overall 2D look to it.

The game flow was dramatically simplified. Diplomacy played virtually no role in the game, and micromanagement of units was scaled-down to a great extent. Rather than having multiple units battling it out at once, combat is one-on-one: the players could choose which units they wished to send into battle, one after another in the stack. The units with ranged attack capabilities get involved in every round in the battle regardless of active unit though. In warfare, the cities no longer added a fixed amount to the fighting values of the defenders, but rather fired random archery shots between the defenders&#x27; strikes.

Although heroes were still obtainable in the usual way, it was now possible to routinely produce them in the top level castles as well.

The city upgrades became more important, as the level of city determines the range of units it can produce.

The races in game became predefined: knights, empire, elves, dark elves, dwarves, dragons, undead, demons, orcs and ogres. Each of these races had its traits, giving it advantages and disadvantages regarding the race of the opposing player. Each player had a certain &quot;favored&quot; race, and the pace of production of units belonging to other races depended on the interracial relations.

The player&#x27;s character in this game was personified as a special unit which only involved in battles over the capital city and could not move around the map. The defeat of the warlord led to defeat of the player, so that all possessed cities became neutral. Traits the player picked at the time of warlord creation gave the warlord some benefits and limitations in the game. The warlord character could be reused in other campaigns.

== Spin-offs ==
=== Card game ===

&quot;Warlords&quot; is an out-of-print collectible card game published in September 1997 by Iron Crown Enterprises.

=== &quot;Battlecry&quot; series ===

&quot;Warlords Battlecry&quot; is a real-time strategy computer game released in July 2000 for Microsoft Windows. Two sequels were released: &quot;Warlords Battlecry II&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Warlords Battlecry III&quot; in 2004.

=== &quot;Puzzle Quest&quot; series ===

&quot;Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords&quot; is a puzzle game based on the &quot;Warlords&quot; universe released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. The game spawned several sequels.

<text>Escambia Bay is a bay located in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, in the far western Florida Panhandle. The city of Pensacola is located on the western side, and the town of Milton is located on the northeastern end of the two-pronged bay. Both places are the county seats of the respective counties. Unusually, Escambia Bay is connected to open waters via Pensacola Bay to its southeast. It is fed primarily by the Escambia River.

National Airlines Flight 193, a Boeing 727, crashed into Escambia Bay during a descent into Pensacola Regional Airport on May 8, 1978. There were 3 fatalities among the 58 people on board.

During Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, the storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico came into Escambia Bay, washing out the Interstate 10 Escambia Bay Bridge.

<text>Armi Helena Kuusela-Williams (née Kuusela, formerly Kuusela-Hilario; born 20 August 1934) is a Finnish-American former beauty queen and philanthropist, best known for being the first-ever Miss Universe. In 1952, she gained national recognition by winning the Finnish beauty contest, Suomen Neito, which qualified her to represent Finland in the inaugural Miss Universe pageant held in Long Beach, California. Following her historic win, Kuusela dedicated her life to philanthropy, business, and cultural ambassadorship. Throughout the years, she became actively involved in numerous charitable organizations and was honored for her contributions to various causes.

==Early life==

Armi Helena Kuusela was one of six children born to Finnish parents who owned and operated a small family business, except when her father, a decorated veteran, fought for Finland during World War II. She attended Elementary and Middle School in Muhos, and Porvoon Naisopisto Boarding School in Porvoo, Finland. She was unexpectedly invited to participate in Finland&#x27;s national beauty pageant because the mother of her boarding school roommate responded to a public notice seeking the ideal representative for &quot;Suomen Neito&quot;, (translated, &quot;Maiden of Finland&quot;). On May 24, 1952, Kuusela won Finland&#x27;s national title, which qualified her to compete in the first Miss Universe Pageant. It also elevated her to the status of a Goodwill Ambassador for Finland. Among her prizes, she received a round trip ticket on Pan American Airlines to attend the first Miss Universe Pageant.

==Miss Universe==

On 17 June 1952, chaperoned by her older sister, Kuusela took the Pan Am flight from Helsinki to Long Beach, California, where she took part in the first Miss Universe Pageant. Thirty contestants participated in the Pageant, held on 28 June 1952. Kuusela, as Suomen Neito, captured the first Miss Universe crown. At her crowning, she was only 17 years old, weighed 49 kg (108 lb), and her height was .

Among her many prizes, Kuusela received a new car and a long-term movie contract from Universal Studios. As titleholder, she also became a Goodwill Ambassador for the Miss Universe organization.

Kuusela was the only Miss Universe to be crowned with the Romanov Imperial Nuptial Crown. The crown was previously owned by the Russian monarchy.

That year, Kuusela also starred in a Finnish movie about her titled &quot;Maailman kaunein tyttö&quot; (The Most Beautiful Girl in the World). Tauno Palo played the role of Jack Coleman, Veikko Itkonen was the director, and Mika Waltari received writing credits for the film.

==Life after Miss Universe==
At the request of the Finnish government shortly after winning the Miss Universe Pageant, Kuusela attended the Olympics in Finland that year. While attending there, the Philippine trade delegation invited her to attend their first International Trade Exposition. On 22 February 1953, Kuusela embarked upon a world tour, again with her older sister as chaperone. She attended the Philippines Exposition and crowned Miss Philippines. While there, she met businessman, developer, and hotelier Virgilio Hilario at a dance in Baguio, a hill station 260 km. north of Manila that served as the nation&#x27;s summer capital. When Kuusela and her sister continued on their tour to Japan, Hilario followed to pursue her. After a whirlwind courtship, Kuusela chose to relinquish her crown shortly before her reign ended as Miss Universe, and married Hilario on 4 May 1953 in Tokyo. They honeymooned in Hawai‘i, then toured the United States and Europe, before settling in Manila.

Kuusela and Hilario owned and operated Gilarmi Corporation, a real estate development company in Makati, which included their eponymous Gilarmi Hotel along Ayala Avenue, the first residential hotel in the Philippines. Between 1955 and 1965, they had five children: Arne, Anna-Lisa, José (Jussi), Eva-Maria and Miguel (Mikko). Hilario died of a heart attack on 7 September 1975, and until 1979, Kuusela was chief executive officer of Gilarmi Corporation and Honorary Counsel of Finland in Manila.
Kuusela was married a second time to American diplomat Albert N. Williams, a Senior Officer with the United States Department of State on 8 June 1978. Kuusela supported Williams in his subsequent appointment as American Consul General in Barcelona, Spain, where they resided from 1979 to 1983. Williams was recalled to Washington, D.C., where they underwent Turkish language training from 1983 to 1985, and then she supported him in his appointment as American Consul General in İzmir, Turkey, where they stayed from 1985 to 1989. Upon retirement in 1989, they settled in La Jolla, a community in San Diego, California. In 1996, Kuusela became a naturalised United States citizen. By then, she had traveled the world, lived in many countries, and spoke seven languages: Finnish, English, Swedish, German, Tagalog, Spanish, and Turkish.

Since retirement, Kuusela has worked on many charitable causes. Since 1992, she has been a Member of the Director&#x27;s Circle of the San Diego Museum of Art and the Chancellor&#x27;s Associates at the University of California, San Diego. From 1993 to 1998, she was a Member of the Director&#x27;s Circle of the Mingei International Museum, and co-chair of the Director&#x27;s Circle from 1993 to 1994. From 1993 to 2006, she served as board member of the Burnham Cancer Research Institute (now known as the Sanford Burnham Preys Institute), and a Member of its Board Nominating Committee. Since then, she has served as a Member of the advisory board of the Fishman Foundation, an affiliate of the Institute that funds research scholarship. Since 1994, she has been a Bravissimo Circle Paton of the San Diego Opera. Since 1995, she has been a Charter Member of the Patrons of the Prado, for the benefit of San Diego&#x27;s iconic Balboa Park museums. In 2010, she became a Member of the International Bipolar Foundation. That year, she also became a Member of the Angel&#x27;s Angels of the San Diego Youth Symphony and Conservatory, and from 2013 to 2018, she served as honorary co-chair of its annual gala to raise scholarships for the children. In 2014, she was admitted into the Order of Saint John, a British order of chivalry, first as a Member and later promoted to the rank of Officer in 2018.

Kuusela has received numerous honors for her charity. In 2000, she received the Deming Award from the Burnham Cancer Research Institute and the Paul Harris Award for Philanthropy from the International Rotary Foundation. In 2008, she received the Fishman Foundation Award. In 2011, the City of San Diego designated August 10, 2011, as Armi Kuusela Williams Day, by Proclamation of Mayor Jerry Sanders. In 2012, the President of Finland awarded Kuusela the Order of the White Rose of Finland, with the rank of Knight (First Class).

She visited her native town of Muhos in August 2014. Her visit was an official meeting with the city municipal manager.

<text>Nothofagus antarctica (&quot;Antarctic beech&quot;; in Spanish &quot;Ñire&quot; or &quot;Ñirre&quot;) is a deciduous tree or shrub native to southern Chile and Argentina from about 36°S to Tierra del Fuego (56° S), where it grows mainly in the diminishing temperate rainforest.

Its occurrence on Hoste Island has previously earned it the distinction of being the southernmost tree on earth; however, in 2019 it was established that &quot;N. betuloides&quot; was found further south, on Hornos Island. &quot;N. antarctica&quot; is present on Hornos as well, but the southernmost individual is slightly further north (17 m) of the southernmost &quot;N. betuloides&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot; typically grows 5–25 m (12–80 ft) tall and has a slender trunk with scaly bark. The leaves are simple and alternate, growing 2–4.5 cm long, and often viscid, with a sweetly scented wax. The leaf color is medium green, turning yellow to orange in the fall. The leaves are broadly ovate to triangular, crinkly, rounded at the tips, irregularly and minutely toothed.

The flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green catkins. The fruit is a 6 mm, very fragrant 4-valved capsule containing three small nuts.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot; has been planted on the North Pacific Coast of the United States and in Great Britain where it thrives. Trees planted in the Faroes, which were imported directly from its southernmost distribution in Tierra del Fuego, have shown good hardiness.

NB: &quot;Lophozonia moorei&quot;, found in Australia, is also referred to as &quot;Antarctic beech&quot;.

<doc id="994949" wikidata="Q6723662" url="?curid=994949" title="Machine Gun Fellatio">
<text>Machine Gun Fellatio (also known by the censored initialism MGF) were an Australian alternative rock band, formed in 1997. They are well known for their provocative on-stage antics and humorous lyrics, as well as the musical merit of their songs. Their outrage-provoking name (coined by an early associate of the band who devised the term from a philosophy exercise) gives some idea of the attitude that pervades the band&#x27;s work. They released three studio albums, three EPs and three singles before breaking up in 2005. In 2024, however, they reformed for three shows.

==History==
===1997–1999: Formation and &quot;Love Comes to an End&quot; ===
Machine Gun Fellatio were formed when members of two Sydney bands, Vrag and Limebunny, combined in 1997. The bands had previously collaborated on projects and had released a compilation record, &quot;Unsound Sounds&quot;, which included a track by Vrag, &quot;Isaac or Fuzz&quot;. &quot;Isaac or Fuzz&quot; consists of parts of a voice message left on a record company answering machine asking for the name of the song that goes &quot;Da da da da...&quot; (the song consists mostly humming of the tune &quot;Reach Up&quot; by the Paul Oakenfold-related project Perfecto Allstarz) put to a fast dance beat. In an interview Glenn Dormand (aka Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab) explained &quot;We got a wrong number on our answering machine. We rang the number back. It was a local Pizza Hut. Basically, they said &#x27;Isaac hasn&#x27;t been here for a long time, and Fuzz isn&#x27;t reliable either&#x27;.&quot; The song received significant airplay on national youth broadcaster Triple J. To capitalise on the success of the song they consolidated the band lineup, with Dave Arroyo and Glenn Dormand (Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab) on vocals and keyboards, Warrick Leggo (LoveShark) on guitar and Ross Johnston (3kShort) on bass, guitar and keyboards, and released their debut EP &quot;Love Comes to an End&quot;.

There were reportedly less than 500 copies of &quot;Love Comes to an End&quot; in existence, Matt Ford, (Pinky Beecroft) once stated in an interview they dumped boxes of their first EP in a skip when they realized they would never sell them. This EP is also referred to as &quot;Isaac or Fuzz&quot;, after their record label stuck stickers proclaiming that it contained the single &quot;Isaac Or Fuzz&quot; to try to increase sales by capitalising on the air play of the song on Triple J.

Ford later joined the band as singer, keyboardist, after leaving Limebunny and turning down an offer to join the band The Whitlams, with whom he helped write their hit song, &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot;, together with Dormand. The band was also joined by Christa Hughes (KK Juggy – the Ks standing for &quot;knickers&quot; and &quot;knockers&quot;), Glenn Abbott (Bryan Ferrysexual) on drums and Maree Bonner (The Widow Jones) on vocals and keyboards completing the band&#x27;s line-up.

===2000–2005: &quot;Bring It On!&quot;, &quot;Paging Mr. Strike&quot; and &quot;On Ice&quot;===
Their first release under this arrangement was the song &quot;Mutha Fukka on a Motorcycle&quot;. The lyrics were based on something sung by a party guest at one of the member&#x27;s homes.

In September 2000, they released their debut studio album, &quot;Bring It On&quot;, on Mushroom Records.

In 2002, they performed live at the Big Day Out festivals, Homebake, Livid, the Woodford Folk Festival and Gone South.

Their second album &quot;Paging Mr. Strike&quot; was released in 2002, containing the band&#x27;s most popular single, &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, which displayed more radio-friendly lyrics and was used in a commercial for Just Jeans. In 2003 the album was followed by a two-disc edition titled &quot;2nd Page for Mr. Strike&quot;, which contained a second disc of remixes and rare tracks.

The group caused some controversy for their wild live performances which often involved both male and female nudity, light bondage gear and implied sexual intercourse with their instruments. After a Student Union organised performance at the University of Melbourne, fellow Victorian universities RMIT University and Swinburne University of Technology cancelled their scheduled performances because of the band&#x27;s lewd behaviour at Melbourne University. This did not stop other Australian universities in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania allowing the band to perform on their campuses and did not stop Melbourne University hiring the band again the following year.

The Widow Jones left the group in 2004 and was replaced by Connie Mitchell (Feyonce), who later became known as the lead singer of Sneaky Sound System. Pinky Beecroft moved to Melbourne to get away from the band and to deal with drug-related health problems. The band&#x27;s last album, &quot;On Ice&quot;, was released the same year and was met with a relatively muted response and the band decided to break up the following year. Issues listed as contributing to the break up include burn out, excessive drug use and creative differences. 

===2005–present: After the Split===
Since the split, various band members have since moved on to other projects:
* Pinky Beecroft formed Pinky Beecroft and the White Russians, whose name was later shortened to just The White Russians.
* 3kShort tours with White Knuckle Fever a duet he formed with Celia Curtis of Circus Bizarre and performs with Vashti Hughes in her show Mum&#x27;s In.
* LoveShark formed the Outer Space Cowboys with 3kShort and played gigs around Sydney.
* Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab became a TV Presenter on Foxtel and now works as a film director on the Stories of Our Town project
* KK Juggy has created and starred in several of her own cabaret shows as well as appearing in other musical theatre productions, film and TV. For two years, she was singer and ring mistress for the highly regarded circus troupe Circus Oz. She went on to release an album of jazz and blues classics with her father Dick Hughes, which toured Australia. She released an album of music with her band the Honky Tonk Shonks and has more recently been seen with her blues psychedelic thrash trio, The Loud Hailers.
* Bryan Ferrysexual (Glenn Abbott) had another band The Bryan Ferrysexual Experience which broke up shortly after MGF did. He later formed Super Massive with singer-writer Malina Hamilton-Smith.
* Feyonce (Connie Mitchell) has since gone on to be one of the lead singers of the Sydney-based band Sneaky Sound System.

On 7 August 2024, it was announced that the band were to reform as one of four support acts for TISM&#x27;s &quot;Death to Art&quot; Tour, alongside The Mavis&#x27;s, Ben Lee and Eskimo Joe. On 11 October, the reformed MGF performed a secret warmup show at the King Street Hotel in Newcastle, which was also the band&#x27;s first show in 19 years. Dormand posted to social media on 20 October that the band would not be playing further shows after the TISM tour.

<text>Ivanoe Bonomi (; 18 October 1873 – 20 April 1951) was an Italian politician and journalist who served as Prime Minister of Italy from 1921 to 1922 and again from 1944 to 1945.

==Background and earlier career==

Ivanoe Bonomi was born in Mantua, Italy, in a bourgeois family. He studied natural sciences at the University of Bologna and graduated in 1896. After working for two years as a high school teacher he also completed a law degree in the same university.

In 1893, influenced by the burgeoning cooperative movement, the spread of Marxist propaganda in the Mantuan countryside, and meetings with socialist leaders like Filippo Turati, Leonida Bissolati, and Anna Kuliscioff, he joined the Italian Socialist Party (at the time called Italian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party). In August 1894 he attended the Socialist congress for the Lombardy region, which was held in semi-clandestine fashion due to the repressive measures taken by Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. In November he was sentenced to 75 days of internal exile for his political activities.

From the beginning he held reformist views and advocated for revisionist positions, including an alliance between the proletariat and the petite bourgeoisie in defense of democratic institutions. In 1896 he proposed that the Party should endorse liberal, bourgeois candidates in run-off elections, and claimed that the main task of the working class was the transformation of Italy into a modern bourgeois democracy before socialism could be established. In spite of early calls for full land collectivization eventually he moved towards more moderate solutions, like the voluntary creation of cooperatives, in agriculture as well. He was critical of the decision to call the general strike of September 1904, but nonetheless collaborated with revolutionary syndicalists for the duration of the strike.

Internationally he supported other reformists like Eduard Bernstein, Alexandre Millerand, and Jean Jaurès.

In 1907 he was elected to the city council of Rome and was a member of the city government for one year. In the 1909 general elections he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the constituency of Mantua. During this time he was a strong advocate of support for Giovanni Giolitti, a liberal reformer, since he felt that this would allow Socialists to influence and contribute to progressive developments like the proposed introduction of universal suffrage. His positions, however, continued to remain a minority within the Socialist Party even if at this time the main leader was Turati, himself a reformist. In 1911 Bonomi dissented again with the party line by writing articles expressing lukewarm support for the invasion of Libya. In March 1912 he, along with other members of the right-wing of the Socialist Party, took the unprecedented move of meeting King Victor Emmanuel III to express their relief for the failure of an anarchist assassination attempt. This finally prompted his expulsion at the party congress held that year, where the more radical faction gained majority control.

Those who had been expelled founded the Italian Reformist Socialist Party (PSRI), which won 3.92% of the vote and 19 seats in the 1913 elections.

The PSRI supported Italy&#x27;s entry into World War I and gave vital support to the nationalist government led by Antonio Salandra. When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, Bonomi volunteered in the Army and was sent to the front as a sub-lieutenant in the 7th Alpini Regiment, taking part in the fighting. In June 1916 he was appointed Minister of Public Works in the Boselli cabinet and held this position for twelve months, until his resignation due to disagreements on domestic policy. He would hold the same Ministry a second time in the Orlando cabinet from January to June 1919. In the war&#x27;s aftermath he was Minister of War (March 1920 – April 1921) and then briefly Minister of the Treasury under Prime Ministers Francesco Saverio Nitti and Giolitti.

==Crisis of the Italian democracy and first term as prime minister==

A few months later, he became Prime Minister of Italy for the first time, in a coalition government, and was the first socialist to hold the post. Early in 1922, his government collapsed, and he was replaced as prime minister by Luigi Facta, amidst the Fascist insurgency led by Benito Mussolini.
==During the Fascist period==

With the consolidation of the Fascist regime, Bonomi withdrew from political life. In the following years he devoted himself to historical research, publishing a number of articles on Giuseppe Mazzini and the 1849 Roman Republic, and working on a history of Italian politics from 1870 to 1918, which would only be published in 1944.

Towards the end of 1942, as Italy was facing military setbacks on many fronts in World War II and growing political dissent at home, he reprised clandestine contacts with anti-fascists from various political parties. He also began the publication of the underground newspaper &quot;la Ricostruzione&quot;.

On 2 June 1943, he had a private audience with King Victor Emmanuel III where he proposed Mussolini&#x27;s dismissal, the appointment of a military government, and the denunciation of the alliance with Nazi Germany. The sovereign did not act on this proposal. During the same month Bonomi had other meetings with Maria José, Princess of Piedmont, and the heir apparent, Prince Umberto II, suggesting the appointment of Marshal Pietro Badoglio as prime minister with himself as his deputy, with the goals of ending both the Fascist dictatorship and the alliance with Adolf Hitler. While by this time Victor Emmanuel had become essentially supportive of the same plan, the King preferred a different solution centered on some leaders of the Armed Forces as well as dissenters within the Fascist Party, which meant that Bonomi was not involved in the planning of Mussolini&#x27;s dismissal and arrest on 25 July.

==Fall of Fascism and second term as prime minister==

After the fall of Fascism in July 1943, Bonomi attended a number of anti-fascist meetings which asked the new government led by Badoglio to disband Fascist organizations, release political prisoners, and restore the free press.

On 9 September, the day after the armistice of Cassibile was announced, six anti-fascist parties agreed to form a National Liberation Committee (CLN), chaired by Bonomi, to lead the Italian resistance movement. The member parties were the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Action Party, the Christian Democracy, the Italian Liberal Party, and Bonomi&#x27;s own Labour Democratic Party. While Rome was under German control Bonomi hid in the area of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, under the protection of Pope Pius XII.

As president of the CLN Bonomi sought to steer discussion away from suggestions that the monarchy should be deposed or that the King should abdicate. Relations with the royal government, which had taken refuge in the Allied-controlled South, were a major point of friction. Communists, Socialists and Actionists saw Victor Emmanuel III as complicit with Fascism and responsible for the disastrous wartime situation due to his attitude during both Mussolini&#x27;s rise and the nearly twenty years of dictatorship, and demanded his immediate departure. Christian Democrats and Liberals preferred to delay any discussion on the form of government to the end of the war, seeing the monarchy as a factor of legitimacy and national unity. Bonomi was also particularly concerned with suppressing any revolutionary aspirations on part of the leftist parties and pursuing the restoration of pre-Fascist liberal democracy. These discussions eventually led him to resign from his post on 24 March 1944. He would return as soon as 5 May, after Communist Party secretary Palmiro Togliatti, who had just returned from exile, unexpectedly endorsed the moderate position. Around the same time Enrico De Nicola also brokered a compromise solution where Victor Emmanuel would delegate his powers to the more palatable Prince Umberto, which the King accepted reluctantly.

On 8 June, two days after the liberation of Rome, Badoglio and representatives of CLN parties, with Noel Mason-MacFarlane as representative of the Allies, agreed that Bonomi would become prime minister. He was sworn in on 18 June. The government was seated at first in the Southern city of Salerno and then, from mid-July, in Rome. Bonomi also held the positions of Minister of the Interior and Minister for Italian Africa (at the time under Allied occupation) and, until December 1944, Minister of Foreign Affairs. His appointment was taken without the knowledge of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who considered a Badoglio a safer choice and had Mason-MacFarlane dismissed over this decision. Mason-MacFarlane, on his part, agreed with the American viewpoint that Badoglio was too discredited to continue serving and that his association with Fascism would weaken the Italian monarchy.

The main issues facing the new government were the prosecution of the war until the liberation of Italy from German occupation, as well as the practical implementation of various compromises that had been previously agreed on in principle. As prime minister, Bonomi formally recognized the partisan forces operating in the North as part of the war effort, and organized them under a unified command led by Army general Raffaele Cadorna Jr., who was parachuted in the occupied areas. He also approved a decree which provided for the election of a Constituent Assembly after the end of the conflict. Continuing disputes on royal prerogatives and on the extent of purges of Fascist sympathisers within the state bureaucracy, however, led him to resign on 25 November. The ensuing government crisis, which saw both Carlo Sforza (who was vetoed by the British over his republican sympathies) and Meuccio Reuini being considered as potential prime ministers, was solved with the re-appointment of Bonomi, who offered the position of deputy prime minister to the Christian Democracy and the Communist Party. The Socialist and Action parties chose not to take part in the new cabinet.

In the last months of war he recognized the authority of the CLNAI (a subsidiary organ of the CLN operating in Northern Italy) in case of a general insurrection, and approved decrees concerning the establishment of a provisional legislative body and the organization of a future referendum on the form of government and general elections for the Constituent Assembly. He also passed reforms in social security, increasing payments to people with lower pensions.

With the end of the war in Europe Bonomi started facing more frequent criticism over his personality and actions in the pre-Fascist era, particularly from politicians who had been living underground in the occupied areas and were close to the partisan movement. Therefore, he resigned on 21 June 1945.

After his successor Ferruccio Parri resigned in December 1945 Liberals tried to propose Bonomi as prime minister, and then again the following year as a Minister in Alcide De Gasperi&#x27;s cabinet, but unsuccessfully.

==Later life==

In June 1946 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly in the list of the National Democratic Union, an alliance between the Liberal Party and the Labour Democratic Party. He chaired the Assembly&#x27;s Treaties Committee. He also attended the preliminary conference for the adoption of the peace treaty with the Allies, in Paris, as a member of the Italian delegation.

In 1948 he became a member by right of the Italian Senate. He was elected as its president, the first after the establishment of the Republic, and served in that position until his death. He joined the newly established Italian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (later known as the Italian Democratic Socialist Party), where he held the honorary position of president.

He died on 20 April 1951 in Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome, the official residence of the President of the Senate, aged 77.

<text>Blackwood Farm is a 2002 vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the ninth book in her &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; series. The novel includes some characters who cross over from Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy (1990–1994), continuing the unified story begun in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000).

==Plot summary==
Tarquin &quot;Quinn&quot; Blackwood, heir to a powerful old family in New Orleans, has been plagued by a mysterious spirit named Goblin for his entire life. Made a vampire in his youth, Quinn seeks out Lestat de Lioncourt looking for help in getting rid of Goblin, who has become more and more malevolent. Quinn recalls his youth, his family, and his forced transformation into a vampire by Petronia. His stories allow Lestat to better understand the reach and power of Goblin, and clue in Lestat to the fact that Quinn is connected to the Mayfair family of witches. After his own failure defeating Goblin, Lestat asks the witch Merrick Mayfair, also a vampire, for assistance. Meanwhile, Quinn has fallen in love with heiress Mona Mayfair, and the ghost of their mutual ancestor Julien Mayfair warns him against making Mona a vampire. Goblin is revealed to be the spirit of Quinn&#x27;s twin Gawain, who died days after being born. He is bound to Quinn, and is relentlessly jealous to experience whatever Quinn does. Merrick performs a ritual using Gawain&#x27;s corpse to exorcise Goblin. She sacrifices herself by carrying the child&#x27;s spirit into the hereafter with her, and Lestat is heartbroken.

==Crossovers==
Some characters from Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy (1990–1994) appear in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000), and later &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; and &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003).

==Audiobooks==
In 2002, Penguin Random House Audio released an abridged audiobook adaptation of &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot;, narrated by Stephen Spinella, as well as an unabridged version, narrated by David Pittu.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; debuted at No. 4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, spending a total of five weeks on the list. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that the novel contains plenty of &quot;intrigue, eroticism and obsession&quot;, adding that &quot;Rice fleshes out her slim plot line with gory set pieces of vampire history in ancient Athens, Pompeii and 19th century Naples. She excels at vivid descriptions of macabre landscapes, gloomy estate houses and the lust that motivates her Blood Hunters and propels her ghoulish narratives. Her dialogue and characterizations, however—even of the durable Vampire Lestat—are flat and predictable here.&quot; Reviewing the audiobook adaptation, &quot;AudioFile&quot; wrote, &quot;Fraught with swamps, witches, cemeteries, forbidden love, and blood lust, all knotted up with family honor, this steamy potboiler is perfect for the &#x27;vampirophile.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: from Marathon to Waterloo is a book written by Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy and published in 1851. This book tells the story of the fifteen military engagements which, according to the author, had a significant impact on world history.

==Chapters==


Each chapter of the book describes a different battle. The fifteen chapters are:

# The Battle of Marathon, 490 BC
#* Excerpt: &quot;Two thousand three hundred and forty years ago, a council of Athenian Officers was summoned on the slope of one of the mountains that look over the plain of Marathon, on the eastern coast of Attica. The immediate subject of their meeting was to consider whether they should give battle to an enemy that lay encamped on the shore beneath them; but on the result of their deliberations depended, not merely the fate of two armies, but the whole future progress of human civilization.&quot;
# Defeat of the Athenians at Syracuse, 413 BC
#* Known as the Battle of Syracuse.
#* Excerpt: &quot;Few cities have undergone more memorable sieges during ancient and medieval times than has the city of Syracuse.&quot;
# The Battle of Gaugamela, 331 BC
#* Also called the Battle of Arbela.
#* Excerpt: &quot;the ancient Persian empire, which once subjugated all the nations of the earth, was defeated when Alexander had won his victory at Arbela.&quot;
# The Battle of the Metaurus, 207 BC
#* Excerpt: &quot;That battle was the determining crisis of the contest, not merely between Rome and Carthage, but between the two great families of the world...&quot;
# Victory of Arminius over the Roman Legions under Varus, AD 9
#* Known as the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.
#* Excerpt: &quot;that victory secured at once and forever the independence of the Teutonic race.&quot;
# The Battle of Châlons, AD 451
#* Also called the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields or the Battle of the Catalun.
#* Excerpt: &quot;The victory which the Roman general, Aëtius, with his Gothic allies, had then gained over the Huns, was the last victory of imperial Rome.&quot;
# The Battle of Tours, AD 732
#* Also called the Battle of Poitiers.
#* Excerpt: &quot;the great victory won by Charles Martel ... gave a decisive check to the career of Arab conquest in Western Europe.&quot;
# The Battle of Hastings, AD 1066
#* Excerpt: &quot;no one who appreciates the influence of England and her empire upon the destinies of the world will ever rank that victory as one of secondary importance.&quot;
# Joan of Arc&#x27;s Victory over the English at Orléans, AD 1429
#* Known as the Siege of Orléans.
#* Excerpt: &quot;the struggle by which the unconscious heroine of France, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, rescued her country from becoming a second Ireland under the yoke of the triumphant English.&quot;
# Defeat of the Spanish Armada, AD 1588
#* Excerpt: &quot;The England of our own days is so strong, and the Spain of our own days is so feeble, that it is not easy, without some reflection and care, to comprehend the full extent of the peril which England then ran from the power and the ambition of Spain, or to appreciate the importance of that crisis in the history of the world.&quot;
# The Battle of Blenheim, AD 1704
#* Excerpt: &quot;Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of Alexander in extent and those of the Romans in durability.&quot;
# The Battle of Pultowa, AD 1709
#* Also called the Battle of Poltava.
#* Excerpt: &quot;The decisive triumph of Russia over Sweden at Pultowa was therefore all-important to the world, on account of what it overthrew as well as for what it established&quot;
# Victory of the Americans over Burgoyne at Saratoga, AD 1777
#* Excerpt: &quot;The ancient Roman boasted, with reason, of the growth of Rome from humble beginnings to the greatest magnitude which the world had then ever witnessed. But the citizen of the United States is still more justly entitled to claim this praise.&quot;
# The Battle of Valmy, AD 1792
#* Excerpt: &quot;the kings of Europe, after the lapse of eighteen centuries, trembled once more before a conquering military republic.&quot;
# The Battle of Waterloo, AD 1815
#* Excerpt: &quot;The exertions which the allied powers made at this crisis to grapple promptly with the French emperor have truly been termed gigantic, and never were Napoleon&#x27;s genius and activity more signally displayed than in the celerity and skill by which he brought forward all the military resources of France ...&quot;

==Derivative works==
Since the publication of Creasy&#x27;s book, other historians have attempted to modify or add to the list.

* In 1899 The Colonial Press published &quot;Decisive Battles of the World&quot; by Edward Shepherd Creasy with a Special Introduction and Supplementary Chapters On the Battles of Gettysburg 1863, Sedan 1870, Santiago and Manila 1898, by John Gilmer Speed (Revised Edition)
* In 1901 the firm J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. from Philadelphia published &quot;Great battles of the world&quot; by Stephen Crane, with illustrations by John Sloan.
* In 1908 Harper &amp; Bros published an edition with eight battles added: Quebec, Yorktown, Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Sedan, Manila Bay, Santiago, and Tsushima.
* In 1920 Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D&#x27;Abernon published &quot;The Eighteenth Decisive Battle of the World: Warsaw, 1920&quot;, in which he claimed that the next battle on the list was the battle of Warsaw, fought in 1920 by the Polish and Bolshevik forces during the Polish–Soviet War.
* In 1930 Texas historian Clarence Wharton published &quot;San Jacinto: The Sixteenth Decisive Battle&quot;, in which he made the case for adding the final battle of the Texas Revolution to Creasy&#x27;s list. In 1936 the San Jacinto Monument was given an inscription that echoed Wharton&#x27;s view: &quot;Measured by its results, San Jacinto was one of the decisive battles of the world. The freedom of Texas from Mexico won here led to annexation and to the Mexican–American War, resulting in the acquisition by the United States of the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Utah and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma. Almost one-third of the present area of the American Nation, nearly a million square miles of territory, changed sovereignty.&quot;
* In 1954–56, British historian J.F.C. Fuller published &quot;The Decisive Battles of the Western World and their Influence upon History&quot;.
* In 1956, historian and author Fletcher Pratt published &quot;The Battles that Changed History&quot;, stories of conflicts that forever changed the course of world events. He listed 16 battles from Arbela to Midway.
* In 1963, Robert Silverberg published &quot;15 Battles that Changed the World&quot; and acknowledged the inspiration of Creasy&#x27;s book. Silverberg&#x27;s list included seven battles that Creasy had listed (Marathon, Tours, Hastings, Orleans, the Spanish Armada, Blenheim, and Waterloo) with six different battles (Zama, Actium, Adrianople, Lepanto, the Plains of Abraham, and Valcour Island) and two that had occurred after Creasy&#x27;s work (Gettysburg and Stalingrad). Silverberg also acknowledged that this was a list of battles that had affected Western history and did not include battles from other parts of history. 
* In 1964, American historian Lt. Col. Joseph B. Mitchell published &quot;Twenty Decisive Battles of the World&quot;, an update of Creasy&#x27;s list with five additions:
*# The Vicksburg Campaign, 1863. By capturing the Mississippi River during the American Civil War, the Union separated the Confederacy into halves.
*# Battle of Sadowa, 1866. This Prussian victory over the Austrians during the Seven Weeks War paved the way for a German empire.
*# First Battle of the Marne, 1914. The British and French prevented a German assault on Paris and an early German victory in World War I.
*# Battle of Midway, 1942. The beginning of the United States offensive in the Pacific Ocean during World War II and the devastating loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers.
*# Battle of Stalingrad, 1942–43. The defeat of the German attempt to conquer the Soviet Union and a significant loss of German resources in World War II.
* In 1976, Noble Frankland and Christopher Dowling published &quot;Decisive Battles of the Twentieth Century&quot;, which listed 23 battles, from the Battle of Tsushima to the Tet Offensive.
* In &quot;100 Decisive Battles: From Ancient Times to the Present&quot; (2001), Paul K. Davis listed battles from Megiddo to Desert Storm.

==In popular culture==
Referring to Creasy&#x27;s work in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, Major-General Stanley boasts that he is able to &quot;quote the fights historical; from Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical.&quot;

==Criticism==

Creasy&#x27;s text, while immensely popular at the time, and still frequently read today came into an increasing amount of criticism from the 20th century onwards in regards to several aspects.

===Eurocentrism===

The vast majority of Creasy&#x27;s selected battles occurred in Europe between two European powers (or in the case of the Battle of Saratoga, between two Western powers). In addition, many of his battles feature England in some capacity, leaving a lack of balance in regards to non-European history.

===Non-decisive===

Creasy&#x27;s text is premised on the fact that his chosen battles were &quot;decisive&quot; - that an alternate result (or the absence of the battle) would lead to the world as we know it being radically different. This viewpoint has been frequently criticised in the last century, with most, though not all, viewpoints disagreeing that (these) singular battles were the primary movers of society.

===Vagueness===

Beyond potential errors in choice or concept, Creasy is criticised for the vagueness of his descriptions, sources given and battle analysis. By World War I, fully reconstructed battle movements and plans were considered the norm if true analysis was to be undertaken. The lack of context, both political and social, around the battles chosen makes consideration of its various impacts either difficult or impossible. There is also a focus on dramatic description or rhetoric of the battles taking precedence over analysis. Set against this however is the fact that Creasy did not specifically set out to target his works for the military or military historians - he also wrote for public readership, and was without military experience or formal training in the field.

<doc id="994972" wikidata="Q1341218" url="?curid=994972" title="Gurung people">
<text>Gurung (exonym; ) or Tamu (endonym; Gurung: ) are a Tibetan ethnic group living in the hills and mountains of Gandaki Province of Nepal. Gurungs speak Tamu kyi which is a Sino-Tibetan language derived from the Tibeto-Burman language family. The written form of Gurung is heavily dependent on the Tibetan script and history and details related to their culture and tradition is passed on from one generation to the other usually by word-of-mouth.

==History==
The origin of the Gurung people can be traced back to Qiang people located in Qinghai, China. 

After the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War and the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the British started recruiting soldiers into the British Army from the northern villages of Nepal. The majority of these soldiers come from four ethnic tribes, one of which is the Gurung tribe. Their distinguished service in various military campaigns has earned them numerous prestigious accolades, including highly decorated medals and Victoria Crosses. Their contributions have been recognized for their exceptional bravery, discipline, and commitment on the battlefield, solidifying their reputation as formidable soldiers within the British and Indian armed forces.

Gurungs continue to be recruited in the British, Indian and Bruneian armies and the Singapore Police Force (under British supervision) as regular soldiers and police officers who retire after serving for anywhere from 15 to 35 years. Upon retiring, with the exception of India, the soldiers and police officers serving in the Bruneian army and Singapore Police Force have to return to Nepal. In 1999, the British government updated its policy under the original 1816 Treaty of Sugauli and allowed Gurkha British Army retirees to settle with their families in the United Kingdom.

==Geographical distribution==

At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, 798,658 people (2.97% of the population of Nepal) identified as Gurung. The proportions of Gurung people by province was as follows:
* Gandaki Province (11.4%)
* Bagmati Province (2.2%)
* Koshi Province (1.4%)
* Lumbini Province (0.9%)
* Karnali Province (0.7%)
* Sudurpashchim Province (0.2%)
* Madhesh Province (0.2%)
The proportions of Gurung people were higher than national average in the following districts:

* Manang (57.1%) 
* Lamjung (31.4%)
* Mustang (20.1%)
* Gorkha (19.8%) 
* Kaski (29.3%)
* Tanahun (11.6%)
* Syangja (9.0%)
* Dolpa (7.1%)
* Chitwan (6.8%)
* Dhading (5.6%)
* Sankhuwasabha (5.4%)
* Taplejung (4.6%)
* Parbat (3.7%)
* Rasuwa (3.1%)
* Tehrathum (2.9%)
* Ilam (2.9%)
* Nawalpur (2.9%)
* Kathmandu (2.6%)
* Rupandehi (2.0%)
==Culture and religion==
Gurung people can be organised into different sub-clans:
===Festivals===

Tamu Lhosar is the main festival of the Gurungs and is celebrated every year on the 15th of Poush (December/January) to celebrate the new year.

===Religion===

Gurung Dharma include Ghyabri (Ghyabring) and Pachyu (Paju). Lamas perform Buddhist rituals as needed, such as in birth, funeral, other family rituals (such as in Domang, Tharchang) and in Lhosar. Lamas perform Buddhist ceremonies primarily in Lamjung, Parbat, Kaski, Manang, Mustang, and elsewhere. Some Gurung villages have kept remnants of a pre-Buddhist form of the Bon religion, which flourished over two thousand years ago across much of Tibet and Western China. They have also kept aspects of an even older shamanic belief system that served as a counter to the Bon religion.

<text>A monstrance, also known as an ostensorium (or an ostensory), is a vessel used in Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, High Church Lutheran and Anglican churches for the display on an altar of some object of piety, such as the consecrated Eucharistic Sacramental bread (host) during Eucharistic adoration or during the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. A monstrance may also serve as a reliquary for the public display of relics of some saints. The word &quot;monstrance&quot; comes from the Latin word , while the word &quot;ostensorium&quot; comes from the Latin word . Either term, each expressing the concept of &quot;showing&quot;, can refer to a vessel intended for the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, but &quot;ostensorium&quot; has only this meaning.

== Liturgical context ==
In the Catholic tradition, at the moment of consecration the elements (called &quot;gifts&quot; for liturgical purposes) are transformed (literally transubstantiated) into the body and blood of Christ. Catholic doctrine holds that the elements are not only spiritually transformed, but are (substantially) transformed into the body and blood of Christ. Although the elements retain the appearance, or accidents of bread and wine, they become the body and blood of Christ. The presence of Jesus Christ God in the Eucharist is known as the doctrine of the Corporeal Presence within the Roman Catholic Magisterium. The Corporeal Presence is believed to be real (in ) and of the whole (&quot;totaliter&quot;) Christ, in Body, Soul and Spirit. The name &quot;Corporeal Presence&quot; concerns the Corporal reserved to the chalice, paten and the ciborium during the Holy Mass.

Other Christians (notably in the Anglican Church, Old Catholic Church, and Lutheran Church) accept the doctrine of the Real Presence, whilst rejecting transubstantiation as a philosophical concept (&quot;cf&quot;. sacramental union). Owing to these beliefs, the consecrated elements are given the same adoration and devotion that Christians of these traditions accord to Christ himself.

Within churches of these traditions the reserved sacrament serves as a focal point of religious devotion. In many of them, during Eucharistic adoration, the celebrant displays the sacrament in the monstrance, typically on the altar. When not being displayed, the reserved sacrament is locked in a tabernacle (more common in Roman Catholicism) or aumbry (more common in the other traditions mentioned).

== Use and design ==
In the service of benediction, (the priest blesses the people with the Eucharist displayed in the monstrance). This blessing differs from the priest&#x27;s blessing, as it is seen to be the blessing by Christ rather than that of the individual priest. The exposition of the monstrance during Benediction is traditionally accompanied by chanting or singing of the hymn &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot;.

Monstrances are usually elaborate in design; most are carried by the priest. Others may be much larger fixed constructions, typically for displaying the host in a special side chapel, often called the &quot;Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament&quot;. For portable designs, the preferred form is a sunburst on a stand, usually topped by a cross.

Before the Council of Trent, the most common design was the tower. The sun design would come to dominate the shape of modern monstrances after it became clear that the ostensorium could be better adapted to the object of drawing all eyes to the Sacred Host itself by making the transparent portion of the vessel just of the size required, and surrounded, like the sun, with rays. Monstrances of this shape, dating from the fifteenth century, are also not uncommon, and for several hundred years past this has been by far the commonest form in practical use.

Medieval monstrances were more varied in form than contemporary ones. Those used for relics, and occasionally for the host, typically had a crystal cylinder in a golden stand, and those usually used for hosts had a crystal window in a flat-faced golden construction, which could stand on its base. The monstrance was most often made of silver-gilt or other precious metal, and highly decorated. In the center of the sunburst, the monstrance normally has a small round glass the size of a host, through which the Blessed Sacrament can be seen. Behind this glass is a holder made of gilded metal, called a lunette or lunula, which holds the host securely in place. When not in the monstrance, the host in its lunula is placed in a special standing container, called a standing &quot;pyx&quot;, in the Tabernacle. Before the current design, earlier &quot;little shrines&quot; or reliquaries of various shapes and sizes were used.

== Noted monstrances ==
*The monstrance of Corpus Christi at the Cathedral of Valencia (Spain) - Every year, during the Corpus Christi procession in Valencia, the largest Monstrance in the world, made of of silver, of gold, of platinum, hundreds of precious stones and thousands of pearls, runs through the streets of Valencia under a shower of flower petals.
*La Lechuga is a monstrance built between 1700 and 1707 that is currently owned by the Banco de la Republica of Colombia. It consists of of 18 karat gold, 1,485 emeralds which gave the name to the piece due to its color, and other gems from various parts of the world.
*The Cathedral of Toledo, Spain, boasts one of the most famous monstrances in European medieval history. Made of pure gold (the first gold brought over from the New World by Admiral Columbus) and encrusted with several jewels, it has merited several papal processions, acclamations and uses. Most recently among these is Pope Benedict XVI in his World Youth Day Apostolic Visit in 2011. It has also been immortalized in several 18th-century and 19th-century devotional handbooks. This portable monstrance (or ostensory) is housed within a second, fixed monstrance made of partially gilded silver.
*The Vatican monstrance () of is one of the most exquisite monstrances used by recent popes, as it is an exact miniature of the Baldachin inside St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. It is complete in ornamentation including the angels adorning its rooftop. It was most recently used by Pope Benedict XVI.
*Raymond Nonnatus and Clare of Assisi are often portrayed with monstrances. Nonnatus used a Gothic box-style monstrance while Clare is often portrayed with a solar version.
*Founderess of the Eternal World Television Network, Mother Angelica of the Annunciation, was often portrayed with a golden solar monstrance pendant.
*The Church of St. Stanislaus Kostka, one of Chicago&#x27;s famed Polish Cathedrals, is home to one of the largest monstrances in the world, a Iconic Monstrance of Our Lady of the Sign. It is part of the planned Sanctuary of The Divine Mercy, which is being constructed adjacent to the church. The Monstrance is to be installed in the sanctuary&#x27;s adoration chapel, to be the focus of 24-hour Eucharistic Adoration. The clergy will conduct no liturgies or vocal prayers in the chapel, either by individuals or groups, as the space is meant for private meditation and contemplation.
* In the treasury at the St. Loreta Church in Prague, there is on display a monstrance featuring 6,000 diamonds.
*On top of the main dome of the Mariavite Temple of Mercy and Charity in Płock, Poland, is a large monstrance. The monstrance is adorned with four angels, each measuring almost in height. The following Polish phrase is inscribed below the monstrance: (in English, &quot;Let us adore Christ the King reigning over all nations&quot;.)
*Perrot&#x27;s Ostensorium was presented by 17th-century fur trader Nicolas Perrot to the priests at the St. Francis Xavier Mission in 1686, located at what is now modern Green Bay, Wisconsin. It was buried by the priests when the local Indians became hostile and burned the mission buildings. It was dug up by accident in 1802 and is currently in the Neville Public Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It is the oldest surviving physical artifact of French settlement west of the Alleghenies.

<text>Razzle is a British softcore pornographic magazine published monthly by Paul Raymond Publications. It was founded in 1983 and is currently focused on girl-next-door style pornography, offering cash for any photos of &quot;readers&#x27; wives&quot; printed; in the past, however, several notable glamour models were featured, including minor celebrity Jo Guest. It also includes the traditional feature of sexual fantasy tales presented as &quot;true&quot; stories.

There was an earlier UK men&#x27;s magazine of the same title, published by Ritz Publishing Co., that dates from the 1930s to the late 1950s. This was a pocket format title, which featured a colour centre spread by the illustrator George Davies. This magazine was banned by the Censorship of Publications Board of the Irish Free State in 1935; the ban carried over to the later title and was lifted in 2011.

Despite the market for softcore pornography decreasing in the UK, &quot;Razzle&quot; is still successful, having launched some spin-off titles including &quot;Razzle Extreme&quot;, &quot;The Best of Razzle&quot;, &quot;Razzle Readers Wives&quot; and &quot;Razzle DVD&quot;. &quot;Razzle&quot; does, however, offer hardcore imagery and videos of the photosets found in its magazines online, on the official Paul Raymond website.

&quot;Razzle&quot; is published by the late Paul Raymond&#x27;s publishing house, whose other publications include &quot;Club International&quot;, &quot;Escort&quot;, &quot;Mayfair&quot;, &quot;Men Only&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s World&quot;. All of the Paul Raymond magazines are widely available in newsagents, although some larger retailers require a modesty bag in order to protect minors from seeing partial nudity on display on the cover. The magazine is also available in digital format from the Paul Raymond website. It was available from the Paul Raymond digital newsstand between 2013 and the closure of the newsstand.

==Early days==
Nicholas Whittaker, journalist and author of &quot;Platform Souls, Blue Period and Sweet Talk&quot;, worked for the company from 1982 to 1987, and played a major role in establishing the new &quot;Razzle&quot; magazine. In its first format, &quot;Razzle&quot; was 48 pages and sold for 50p. He wrote of his experiences and the formation of the new magazine in &quot;Blue Period&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The earlier men&#x27;s magazine (1930s–1950s) was later immortalised in the Ian Dury song &quot;Razzle In My Pocket&quot; (1977, the &#x27;B&#x27; side to &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Dury&#x27;s first single under his own name), a story of a boy who steals a copy of &quot;Razzle&quot; from a newsagent. The song also appears on the 1981 compilation LP &quot;Juke Box Dury&quot; (side 1, track 6). &quot;Razzle&quot; is also mentioned in David Lodge’s 1970 novel &quot;Out of the Shelter&quot;. In the book, the magazine is passed from hand to hand at the protagonist&#x27;s school, and its readers are annoyed that the parts they are most interested in are covered up.

The Paul Raymond magazine (1983–) has been referenced in the mainstream media, with the name &quot;Razzle&quot; having been mentioned in numerous British comedy TV programmes, including &quot;Meet Ricky Gervais&quot;, &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;, and in an episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; where it is implied that Patsy once posed for the magazine (albeit in the early 1970s when the magazine was not actually in production). It is also mentioned in &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; and &quot;Bottom&quot;, and in &quot;Little Britain&quot;, when Lou buys the magazine for Andy.

<text>Charles Dunbar Burgess King (12 March 1875 – 4 September 1961) was a Liberian politician who served as the 17th president of Liberia from 1920 to 1930. He was of Americo-Liberian and Sierra Leone Creole descent. He was a member of the True Whig Party, which ruled the country from 1878 until 1980.

King was Attorney General from 1904 until 1912, and Secretary of State of Liberia from 1912 until he was elected president in 1919. In this capacity, he attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and the accompanying First Pan-African Congress. Though a moderate supporter of reform, he continued to support the patronage machine and corrupt dominance of the True Whig Party.

President King&#x27;s administration was marked by scandal. His economic agenda and development plan consistently fell short of expectations; and while literacy rates increased with broader access to public education, his presidency is best known for a string of political scandals and economic setbacks.

In 1927, he won the presidential election with over 15 times more votes than there were electors, causing concern for a rigged and corrupt election, but a forced labor and slavery scandal forced his resignation in 1930. Charles King resigned in disgrace and retired from seeking higher office thereafter until his death. His presidency was marked by extreme corruption, nepotism for the hiring of officials rather than by skill, and a lack of transparency regarding the decisions his administration was making regarding the welfare of the people and use of slave labor.

==Presidency (1920–1930)==
King became Liberia&#x27;s President in 1920 and served for ten years. As president, he helped establish the Booker Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute in Kakata in 1929, and although King was considered a moderate reformer within the True Whig Party, his administration was mired in corruption and controversy, serving the party&#x27;s patronage machine and making appointments based on nepotism and political favors.

===Negotiation of a loan from the United States===

By the early 1920s, Liberia&#x27;s financial crisis had worsened to the point where President King headed up a commission that traveled to the United States to seek reorganization of the country&#x27;s staggering debt burden. They arrived in March 6, 1921, shortly after President Warren G. Harding had taken office. The U.S. Congress had suspended all foreign credit and extension of foreign loans, even though the U.S. State Department favored approving the request from the Liberian delegation. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes said that it was the moral duty to extend the requested loan to Liberia because of a 1918 agreement between the two countries. The following month, President Harding told Congress that he agreed with Secretary Hughes. Negotiations dragged on until October before the State Department finally granted Liberia a loan for $5million (equivalent to $million in )

The United States government under President Harding proposed anew (after an attempt made during World War I from Liberian President Howard to get a loan from the previous Woodrow Wilson Administration) to Congress a $5million loan to Liberia. The House of Representatives approval the loan in a vote of 148–139, but the Senate voted 42–32 against giving the loan. This created great disappointment and a sense of desperation among Liberian officials, who worried that British and French designs on their country might now prove unstoppable. Liberia had become a charter member of the League of Nations in 1919, and the Liberian government was determined to safeguard its sovereignty.

===Firestone Rubber Company===
In 1925, Firestone Rubber Company agreed to a 99-year lease of of land in Liberia in order to grow rubber on it. Firestone began exporting rubber from Liberia in 1934. The Liberian economy soon came to depend on it. Firestone&#x27;s subsidiary Finance Corporation of America gave a $5million loan to the Liberian government, which Liberia intended to use to consolidate and bond debts and fund public improvements. Under the terms of the loan, the President of the United States appointed a financial advisor to Liberia who had the power to approve and disapprove all expenditures by the Liberian government. The Liberian government was also required to use $2.5million of the loan to purchase bonds at a tenpercent markup. Of the remainder, over $1.1million went toward loan repayments on a 1912 loan from the U.S. As a result, very little of the proceeds of the 1934 loan were available to help the country. Meanwhile, the loan repayments constituted 40percent of the Liberian government&#x27;s annual income.

===Presidential election of 1927===

King was challenged in the 1927 presidential election by Thomas Faulkner. According to the official statement, King received 234,000 votes; however, Liberia only had 15,000 registered voters at the time. Thus, King was later listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for the most fraudulent election reported in history.

===Forced labor and slavery scandal===
After losing the 1927 presidential election to King, Thomas Faulkner accused many members of the True Whig Party government of recruiting and selling contract labor as slaves. Despite Liberia&#x27;s firm denials and a refusal to cooperate, the League of Nations established a commission under the leadership of British zoologist Cuthbert Christy to determine the extent of forced labor and slavery still practiced by Liberia. U.S. President Herbert Hoover briefly suspended relations to press Monrovia into compliance.

In 1930, the League of Nations published the committee&#x27;s report, dubbed the &#x27;Christy Report&#x27; after the Committee&#x27;s chairman. The report supported many of Faulkner&#x27;s allegations and implicated many government officials, including vice president Allen Yancy. It was found that forced labor was used for the construction of certain public works such as roads in the interior. And certain tribes did practice domestic servitude that could be considered as slavery.

The report found:
# &quot;In order to suppress the native, prevent him from realizing his powers and limitations and prevent him from asserting himself in any way whatever, for the benefit of the dominant and colonizing race, although originally the same African stock as themselves, a policy of gross intimidation and suppression has for years been systematically fostered and encouraged, and is the key word of the Government native policy;&quot; and
# that, &quot;...Vice President Yancy [of Liberia] and other high officials of the Liberian Government, as well as county superintendents and district commissioners, have given their sanction for compulsory recruitment of labor for road construction, for shipment abroad and other work, by the aid and assistance of the Liberian Frontier Force; and have condoned the utilization of this force for purposes of physical compulsion on road construction for the intimidation of villagers, for the humiliation and degradation of chiefs, of captured natives to the coast, there guarding them till the time of shipment [to Fernando Po and Sao Tome.]&quot;

Subsequently, King and Vice-President Yancy, along with other implicated leaders, resigned.

==Post-presidency==
King served as resident minister to the United States from 24 to 25 July 1947, when the legation was raised to embassy. King continued to serve as ambassador until 1952.

== Personal life ==
King was first married to Janie E. Scott, and the couple had a son and two daughters. His second wife was Cecelia Adeline Cooper and they had one son together. In 1919, King and his wife were guests of President Woodrow Wilson in the United States.

He is the grandfather of Olubanke King Akerele.

<doc id="994997" wikidata="Q3422570" url="?curid=994997" title="Reforms of French orthography">
<text>French orthography was already (more or less) fixed and, from a phonological point of view, outdated when its lexicography developed in the late 17th century and the was mandated to establish an &quot;official&quot; prescriptive norm. Still, there was already much debate at the time opposing the tenets of a traditional, etymological orthography, and supporting those of a reformed, phonological transcription of the language.

César-Pierre Richelet chose the latter (reformed) option when he published the first monolingual French dictionary in 1680, but the chose to adhere firmly to tradition in the first edition of its dictionary (1694).

Various other attempts at simplification followed, culminating in the &quot;rectifications&quot; of 6 December 1990. Further, more radical proposals also exist to simplify the existing writing system, but these have failed to gather much interest to date.

==16th century==

Spelling and punctuation before the 16th century was highly erratic, but the introduction of printing in 1470 provoked the need for uniformity.

Several Renaissance humanists (working with publishers) proposed reforms in French orthography, the most famous being Jacques Peletier du Mans who developed a phonemic-based spelling system and introduced new typographic signs (1550). Peletier continued to use his system in all his published works, but his reform was not followed.

==18th century==
:&quot;&quot;—Académie, 1740, using accents for the first time

The third (1740) and fourth (1762) editions of the Académie dictionary were very progressive, changing the spelling of about half the words altogether.

Accents, which had been in common use by printers for a long time, were finally adopted by the Académie, and many mute consonants were dropped.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (to be)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (monastic)

Many changes suggested in the fourth edition were later abandoned along with thousands of neologisms added to it.

Very importantly too, subsequent 18th century editions of the dictionary added the letters &quot;J&quot; and &quot;V&quot; to the French alphabet in replacement of consonant &quot;I&quot; and &quot;U,&quot; fixing many cases of homography.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (vile)

==19th century==

Many changes were introduced in the sixth edition of the Académie dictionary (1835), mainly under the influence of Voltaire. Most importantly, all &quot;oi&quot; digraphs that represented were changed to &quot;ai,&quot; thus changing the whole imperfect conjugation of all verbs. The borrowing of &quot;&quot; into English predates this change; the modern French spelling is &quot;&quot;.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (was)

The spelling of some plural words whose singular form ended in &quot;D&quot; and &quot;T&quot; was modified to reinsert this mute consonant, so as to bring the plural in morphological alignment with the singular. Only &quot;, &quot; retained the old form, because it was perceived that the singular and the plural had different meanings. The Académie had already tried to introduce a similar reform in 1694, but had given up with their dictionary&#x27;s second edition.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (parents)

In 1868, Ambroise Firmin-Didot suggested in his book &#x27; (Observations on French Spelling) that French phonetics could be better regularized by adding a cedilla beneath the letter &quot;t&quot; in some words. For example, in the suffix &#x27; this letter is usually not pronounced as (or close to) in French, but as . It has to be distinctly learned that in words such as &#x27; (but not &#x27;) it is pronounced . A similar effect occurs with other prefixes or within words. Firmin-Didot surmised that a new character ţ could be added to French orthography.

==20th century==

With important dictionaries published at the turn of the 20th century, such as those of Émile Littré, Pierre Larousse, Arsène Darmesteter, and later Paul Robert, the Académie gradually lost much of its prestige.

Hence, new reforms suggested in 1901, 1935, and 1975 were almost totally ignored, except for the replacement of apostrophes with hyphens in some cases of (potential) elision in 1935.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (grandmother)

Since the 1970s, though, calls for the modernisation of French orthography have grown stronger. In 1989, French prime minister Michel Rocard appointed the Superior Council of the French language to simplify French orthography by regularising it.

===Rectifications of 1990 === 

The council, with the help of some Académie members and observers from Francophone states, published reforms that it called &quot;&quot; on 6 December 1990.

Those &quot;rectifications&quot;, instead of changing individual spellings, published general rules or lists of modified words. In total, around 2000 words have seen their spelling changed, and French morphology was also affected.

====Hyphens====

Numerals are joined with hyphens:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (700,321).

Elements of compound nouns are fused together:
*if one element is a verb: &#x27; → &#x27; (wallet)
*in bahuvrihi compounds (where the individual sense of the elements has changed): &#x27; → &#x27; (midwife)
*in onomatopoeias: &#x27; → &#x27; (quack).

Loan compounds are also fused together:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (hot dog).
:&#x27; → &#x27;, aligning the word with its modern English spelling.

====Number====

Compound nouns joined with hyphens (or fused) make their plural using normal rules, that is adding a final &quot;s&quot; or &quot;x&quot;, unless the modifier is an adjective (in which case both elements must agree), or the head is a determined noun, or a proper noun:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (letter scales)

Loanwords also have a regular plural:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (songs)
The &quot; (known as a diaeresis in English) indicating exceptionally that the &quot;u&quot; is not silent in &quot; + vowel&quot; combinations is to be placed on the &quot;u&quot; instead of on the following vowel. Also, trémas are added to such words where they were not previously used:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (&quot;fem.&quot; acute)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (ambiguity)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (to argue)

A is also added to a &quot;u&quot; following an &quot;&quot; added to soften a &quot;g&quot;, to prevent the &quot;eu&quot; combination being read as :

:&#x27; → &#x27; (wager)

====Accents====

Verbs with their infinitive in &quot;éCer&quot; (where C can be any consonant) change their &quot;é&quot; to &quot;è&quot; in the future and conditional:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (I shall give up)

Additionally, verbs ending in &quot;e&quot; placed before an inverted subject &quot;je&quot; change their &quot;e&quot; to &quot;è&quot; instead of &quot;é&quot;:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (do I like?)

Circumflex accents are removed on &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; if they are not needed to distinguish between homographs. They are retained in the simple past and subjunctive of verbs:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (driven), but &quot;&quot; unchanged (he must have driven), and
:&#x27; (the past participle of the very common irregular verb &#x27;, or the noun created from this participle) is kept to make the distinction with &#x27; (the required contraction of &#x27;, which means &quot;some&quot; when used as an undetermined masculine article, or means &quot;of the&quot; when used as a preposition).

Wherever accents are missing or wrong because of past errors or omissions or a change of pronunciation, they are added or changed:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (to receive – stolen goods)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (event)

Accents are also added to loanwords where dictated by French pronunciation:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (diesel)

====Schwa changing into open &quot;e&quot;====

In verbs with an infinitive in &#x27; or &#x27;, the opening of the schwa ( → ) could previously be noted either by changing the &quot;e&quot; to &quot;è&quot; or by doubling the following &quot;l&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, depending on the verb in question. With this reform, only the first rule shall be used except in the cases of &#x27;, &#x27;, and their derivatives (which continue to use &quot;ll&quot; and &quot;tt&quot; respectively).
:&#x27; → &#x27; (I label)

This applies also when those verbs are nominalized using the suffix &quot;:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (pile)

====Past participle agreement====

Notwithstanding the normal rules (see French verbs), the past participle &quot; followed by an infinitive never agrees with the object:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (I let them go, literally: I have let them go)

This is an alleged simplification of the rules governing the agreement as applied to a past participle followed by an infinitive. The participle &quot;&quot; already followed an identical rule.

====Miscellaneous====

Many phenomena were considered as &quot;anomalies&quot; and thus &quot;corrected&quot;. Some &quot;families&quot; of words from the same root showing inconsistent spellings were uniformized on the model of the most usual word in the &quot;family&quot;.

:&#x27; → &#x27; (idiocy)

This rule was also extended to suffixes in two cases, actually changing them into totally different morphemes altogether:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (haunch)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (leveret)

Isolated words were adjusted to follow older reform where they had been omitted:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (sickly sweet)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (onion)

Lastly, some words have simply seen their spelling simplified, or fixed when it was uncertain:

:&#x27; → &#x27; (mess)
:&#x27; → &#x27; (punch)

====Application====

These &quot;rectifications&quot; were supposed to be applied as of 1991 but, following a period of agitation and the publication of many books such as the Union of copy editors&#x27; attacking new rules one by one, André Goosse&#x27;s defending them, or Josette Rey-Debove&#x27;s accepting a few (that have been added, as alternative spellings, to Le Robert), they appeared to have become, for a while, dead proposals.

==21st century==
In 2004, an international institutional effort to revive the 1990 spelling reforms arose. Notably, a French-Belgian-Swiss association was set up to promote reform. In July of the same year, Microsoft announced that the French version of their applications would soon comply with the new spelling rules. On 23 March 2005, a version of Encarta was published using the new spelling, and, on 14 April 2005, an update of Microsoft Office was offered.

Officially, French people, including public workers, are free for an undetermined length of time to continue using the old spelling. The new spelling is &quot;recommended&quot;, but both old and new are considered correct.

In Quebec, the , which was reluctant at first to apply what it prefers to call the &quot;modernisation&quot;, because of the opposition it received in France, announced that it was now applying its rules to new borrowings and neologisms.

More and more publications are modernizing spelling. Le Forum, from the Université de Montréal, and Les Éditions Perce-Neige have adopted the new spelling.

In 2009, several major Belgian publishing groups began applying the new spelling in their online publications.

The 2009 edition of the incorporates most of the changes. There are 6000 words that have both the traditional and alternative spellings. The 2011 edition of the Dictionnaire Larousse incorporates all of the changes.

On 3 February 2016, a report by French television channel TF1 that the reforms would be applied from the next school year caused wide outrage. A &quot;#JeSuisCirconflexe&quot; campaign ensued on Twitter and the government was accused of &quot;simplifying&quot; the language. However, the government said the circumflex would not be eliminated and that pupils could use either the old or new spellings.

There are also fringe movements to further reform the language: for example, one led by the linguist Mickael Korvin, who would like to radically simplify French by eliminating accents, punctuation and capital letters and, in 2016, invented a new way to spell French called nouvofrancet.

<text>The North Queensland Cowboys is an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Townsville, the largest city in North Queensland. They compete in Australia&#x27;s premier rugby league competition, the National Rugby League (NRL).

Since their foundation in 1995, the club has appeared in three grand finals (2005, 2015 and 2017) winning in 2015, and has reached the finals eleven times. The team&#x27;s management headquarters and home ground, North Queensland Stadium, currently known as Queensland Country Bank Stadium due to sponsorship rights, are located in the suburb of South Townsville.

The Cowboys were admitted to the premiership for the 1995 ARL season. They played in the breakaway Super League competition in 1997 before continuing to compete in the re-unified NRL competition the following year. After running into financial trouble in 2001, the club was taken over by News Limited. In 2007, the team was sold by News Limited to the Cowboys Leagues Club.

In 2015, the Cowboys played in the first all-Queensland Grand Final, defeating the Brisbane Broncos 17–16 in golden point to win their first premiership.

==History==

===1995–1996: ARL===

With the success of the Broncos in 1988, speculation intensified as to if the NSWRL would admit a new team based in North Queensland. In 1993, the NSWRL announced that North Queensland would enter the competition in 1995, along with three other new sides. One of the major difficulties that faced the club in their early years was attracting followers from the more established Queensland-based Winfield Cup side, the Brisbane Broncos. This was exacerbated by an initial lack of onfield success and stability. In their first two seasons, the Cowboys had eight different captains and finished last in their inaugural season.

===1997: Super League===

After much court action in 1995 and 1996, a ten team Super League competition was held in 1997. The Cowboys competed in this competition, and their squad was bolstered by a number of new signings including Ian Roberts and Steve Walters. However, they were unable to improve on the club&#x27;s results in previous years, and for the second time in three seasons they were to finish the season in last place.

North Queensland&#x27;s first game of the Super League season, a 24–16 win over new team the Adelaide Rams played on 1 March at Stockland Stadium in front of 17,738 fans was also the first ever game of the Super League&#x27;s competition.

===1998–1999: National Rugby League===

In 1998 the Super League and Australian Rugby League competitions merged to form the National Rugby League (NRL). The Cowboys began their first season in this competition strongly, and after six rounds they were in equal first place. Although they fell away later in the season, they were to record the largest come-back to date in an Australian first grade rugby league match, defeating the Penrith Panthers 36–28 after trailing 26–0 at half-time. 1998 also saw the Cowboys record their largest loss to date, being defeated 62–0 by the North Sydney Bears in the last round of the home and away season.

The Cowboys signed their eleventh captain in 1999, Noel Goldthorpe. Paul Bowman was also to serve in that role during the season. Although their on-field performances were not spectacular, continuing high attendance figures saw aggregate attendances exceed one million spectators. This season the Cowboys also provided their first State of Origin representative when Paul Green was selected as Queensland&#x27;s halfback for game 2 of the 1999 State of Origin series.

===2000–2003: Improved results===

In the years 2000 through to 2002 the Cowboys continued to struggle with off-field dramas and the struggles of coaches
and poor on-field performances. After finishing last in 2000, season 2001 began slowly. Tim Sheens resigned on 25 May and was replaced by his then assistant Murray Hurst. 4 straight losses in the opening rounds of 2002 led to Hurst being replaced early in the 2002 season, by former Illawarra Steelers and Leeds Rhinos coach Graham Murray. Murray stamped his authority and coaching prowess on the club and the NQ Cowboys looked far more competitive towards the end of the 2002 season. The Cowboys spent much of the 2003 season in the top eight with much improved performances from a host of players, including local talents Matt Bowen and Josh Hannay. The 2003 season ended with the Cowboys four points adrift of a top eight play-off position.

===2004–2005: First time finalists and Grand Finalists===

After a slow start to the season that saw them at 13th on the ladder with just one win and five losses, the Cowboys turned it around in the second half of the season to finish with 12 wins and 11 losses and 7th spot, giving the club their first ever top eight appearance.

The Cowboys fairytale year continued when they upset the 2nd place Canterbury away from home in the first week of the finals, 30–22, thanks largely to hat-trick hero Matt Sing. The following week the Cowboys defeated their state rivals the Brisbane Broncos at home, 10–0, in perhaps the club&#x27;s most famous victory.

They ended up falling one game short of the grand final, losing to the Sydney Roosters, 19–16.

North Queensland would go one better in 2005, when they reached their first grand final in club history. With the help of new recruits Carl Webb and Johnathan Thurston, the side finished in 5th spot and with back-to-back finals appearances. They would ultimately lose the grand final to the Wests Tigers.

In his first year with the club, Johnathan Thurston won the Dally M Medal and made his State of Origin debut for Queensland.

===2006–2007: Further improvement===

In 2006, the Cowboys started the year with a 6-game winning streak and looked destined for another finals appearance, before ending the season with just 5 wins from 19 games and finishing in 9th position.

The 2007 season saw the Cowboys 3rd finals appearance and their first top 4 finish. They faced the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in Townsville in week 1 of the finals, scraping home by 2 points. The following week, they defeated the New Zealand Warriors at home by 37 points. They fell one game short of the grand final again, this time losing to Manly, 28–6. 2007 saw retirement of club legend Paul Bowman, who took up a coaching role with the team in 2008.

Johnathan Thurston finished the year with his second Dally M Medal and Matt Bowen was named Dally M Fullback of the Year.

===2008–2010: Struggling seasons===

At the start of the 2008 season, the club announced head coach Graham Murray&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. After only winning three of the first ten games, Murray resigned from his job and the club promoted assistant coach Ian Millward to the head coaching role for the rest of the year. During his stint as head coach, the club could only win two more games. Throughout the season the team were decimated by injuries and suspensions as well as off-field issues. In the end, the Cowboys finished 15th on the ladder avoiding the wooden spoon by for and against.

2009 saw the appointment of Neil Henry as head coach, who had won the Dally M Coach of the Year with the Canberra Raiders the previous year. The club however experienced another disappointing season, finishing 12th with 11 wins and 13 losses. 2009 also saw Matthew Bowen score his 100th try, becoming the first North Queensland player to score 100 tries for the club and the debut of future Australian and New South Wales representative forward James Tamou.

The beginning out the 2010 season was marred with the speculation of whether Johnathan Thurston would renew his contract with the club. Thurston ended up re-signing for another three seasons, however it brought very little success. The club finished 15th and would have received the wooden spoon if not for the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal. 2010 saw the emergence of Scott Bolton and seeing the test debut of Matthew Scott. Jason Taumalolo became the Cowboys youngest ever debutant, making his debut against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in round 24 aged 17 years and 82 days.

===2011–2013: Return to the Finals===

After missing the finals for the last 3 seasons the Cowboys underwent a major overhaul of personnel for the 2011 season. Club legend Ty Williams retired and they parted ways with club favourites Luke O&#x27;Donnell, Carl Webb and Steve Southern. Their biggest signing for the 2011 season was Queensland and Australian representative centre Brent Tate. They also made key recruits in the signings of former Melbourne Storm and Queensland State of Origin representative Dallas Johnson and premiership winner Glenn Hall from the English Super League, re-signing a former Cowboy in Gavin Cooper and picking up younger, experienced first graders such as Antonio Winterstein.

The Cowboys&#x27; new signings had a positive impact on the NRL team, with the Cowboys spending much of the year in the top four before a late slide dropped them to seventh position and giving them their first finals appearance since 2007. That year, they were the most watched NRL club on pay television, and their round four clash with the Parramatta Eels was the fourth most-watched sports event in Fox Sport&#x27;s history.

2012 saw North Queensland return to the finals after finishing in 5th spot. They faced the Brisbane Broncos in the first week of the finals, winning 33–16, with halfback Michael Morgan scoring a hat trick. They lost the following week to Manly, in controversial circumstances. Club legend Aaron Payne retired at the end of the season, after ten years with the team.

North Queensland again made the finals in 2013, the first time the club had made the finals series three straight years, when they finished in 8th place. After a poor start to the season, the side went on a 6-game winning streak following the sacking of coach Neil Henry. They were eliminated in Week 1 of the finals, after a controversial loss to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Club legend Matthew Bowen played his last season in the NRL, announcing he would be taking up an offer with Super League side, the Wigan Warriors. Club stalwarts Ashley Graham and Dallas Johnson also announced their retirements.

On 1 October 2013, former North Queensland halfback Paul Green was announced as head coach for the 2014 and 2015 seasons, becoming the first former Cowboys player to coach the club.

===2014–2017: A new era and the club&#x27;s first premiership===

The Cowboys started their 2014 season by winning the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines tournament which was held at Eden Park in Auckland. After losing key signing Lachlan Coote early in the tournament to injury, the Cowboys went on to face the Brisbane Broncos in the final, defeating them 16–7 to claim the trophy and a prize money cheque of $370,000.

After a difficult start to the season and a string of injuries to key players including internationals, the North Queensland club made a late charge to the finals finishing in fifth place and cementing a spot in the finals where they defeated the Brisbane Broncos, 32–20. They then travelled to Sydney to face the 2013 premiers the Sydney Roosters in the second week of the finals where they were defeated 31–30.

In 2015, North Queensland experienced their best ever regular season. They had a club record 11 game winning streak and finished with a club record 17 wins. In September, Johnathan Thurston won a record fourth Dally M Medal at the Dally M Awards.

On 26 September 2015, North Queensland qualified for their second grand final defeating the Melbourne Storm, 32–12. In the Grand Final, they defeated the Brisbane Broncos, 17–16. Thurston, who won the Clive Churchill Medal, kicked the winning field goal in golden point to win North Queensland&#x27;s their first ever premiership.

On 21 February 2016, the club won their first World Club Challenge and were crowned the world&#x27;s best club, defeating the Leeds Rhinos 38–4 at Headingley Rugby Stadium in Leeds, England. The club could not defend its premiership, finishing the 2016 NRL season in 4th place and falling one game short of the Grand Final, being eliminated by the Cronulla Sharks 32–20 at Allianz Stadium.

In 2017, despite losing co-captains Johnathan Thurston and Matthew Scott to season-ending injuries, the club qualified for their third Grand Final. Although they were just the second side to reach the Grand Final from 8th place, they would lose to the Melbourne Storm, who finished the regular season as minor premiers.

===2018–2019: Departure of club legends===

Before the 2018 season began, North Queensland were predicted by many to challenge for the premiership with the return of Matthew Scott and Johnathan Thurston from injury. Instead, they struggled to move away from the bottom of the ladder, going on two separate five-game losing streaks throughout the season. With two rounds to play, the club sat in last place. Two wins from their final two games saw them finish in 13th. The 2018 season would be the last for Thurston, who retired after 14 seasons, 294 games and one premiership for the club. In his final match, the Cowboys defeated the Titans 30–26.

Despite a poor 2018 and the loss of Thurston, many expected the Cowboys to return to the finals in 2019. What followed was another disappointing year in which the club finished 14th. Club legends Matthew Scott and Scott Bolton were farewelled at the end of the season. Both were members of the club&#x27;s premiership winning side in 2015 and spent their entire NRL careers at the club. The club also played its final game at Willows Sports Complex, defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 15–8.

===2020–2022: Rebuilding seasons and finals return===

Following two poor seasons in which they missed the finals, North Queensland looked to rebuild ahead of the 2020 NRL season. Their marquee signing was Australian and Queensland representative Valentine Holmes, who had spent 2019 playing for the New York Jets in the NFL. Holmes, a Townsville junior, signed a six-year deal with the club.

On 20 July 2020, after just three wins from their first 10 games, Paul Green announced his resignation from the club, with assistant coach Josh Hannay named as the interim head coach. On 4 September 2020, Todd Payten, a former assistant coach at the club, was announced as North Queensland&#x27;s head coach on a three-year deal, starting in 2021.

Under Payten, the Cowboys endured another disappointing season, finishing 15th with seven wins.

In 2022, the club returned to the finals series after four seasons, finishing the regular season in third and equalling a club record of 17 regular season wins. They ultimately fell just one game short of the Grand Final, with Todd Payten later named the Dally M Coach of the Year.

North Queensland started the 2023 NRL season poorly which saw the club only winning three of their opening ten games. In round 12, the club suffered one of their worst defeats losing 66–18 against the Wests Tigers. In round 18, North Queensland recorded the third biggest victory in Australian rugby league history defeating the Wests Tigers 74–0. It was also the largest victory of the NRL era.
North Queensland would finish the 2023 NRL season in 11th place and miss the finals. In the final round of the season, the club had the chance to make the finals if they were able to beat Penrith but the North Queensland side came up short losing 44–12.
In the 2024 NRL season, North Queensland would finish 5th on the table and qualify for the finals. After defeating Newcastle in the elimination final, the clubs season would be ended the following week by Cronulla in the semi-final.

===2025 NRL Squad===
===Notable players===

Since 1995, the Cowboys have supplied numerous players to state and international representative sides.

====10th anniversary team====
In 2004, the Cowboys conducted a poll asking fans to vote on the best players to have worn Cowboy colours. After polling had finished the club released the overall best team to celebrate the team&#x27;s 10th anniversary.
====20th anniversary team====
In 2015, the Cowboys celebrated their 20th anniversary and named a 20-year team at their anniversary dinner. The team was selected from a panel consisting of four former Cowboys coaches: Grant Bell, Neil Henry, Murray Hurst and Tim Sheens, and then-current coach Paul Green.
====25th anniversary team====
In 2020, the Cowboys celebrated their 25th anniversary and announced a 25-year team at their anniversary dinner, voted on by fans of the club. A number of players selected five years earlier were again in the side, with Kyle Feldt, Michael Morgan and Jason Taumalolo the new additions. John Asiata was selected as the club&#x27;s best utility player.
====Cowboys Hall of Fame====
In 2015, the Cowboys launched their official Hall of Fame during their 20th anniversary celebrations. The foundation criteria were that any players considered had to have played at least 100 NRL games for the club and that they had to have been retired for at least two years. The inductees were decided by a specially selected panel, including members of the Cowboys&#x27; organisation and the wider rugby league community, and are assessed on their skill and ability, leadership, integrity and character, their state and international honours, and awards won at the club.

In 2019, Matthew Bowen was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the club&#x27;s 2019 season launch event.

==Coaches==
The Cowboys&#x27; current coach, Todd Payten took over as head coach of the side from 2021, becoming the club&#x27;s tenth and incumbent coach.
==Honours==

At the end of each season the North Queensland Cowboys hold their Presentation Ball, in which they present (among other awards) the Paul Bowman Medal for Cowboy of the Year. The player of the year award, which was named after Bowman in 2007, is awarded to Cowboys player voted as the best and fairest over the premiership season. After each match, the coaching staff award three votes to the best Cowboys player on ground, two votes to the second best, and one vote to the third best, similar to the Dally M Medal voting system.

The most recent Paul Bowman Medal winner is Jason Taumalolo, who won the award for the first time in 2016 and is the first player to win the award four consecutive times. Bowman himself is a two-time winner of the award (1999, 2000), as is Luke O&#x27;Donnell (2004, 2009), Aaron Payne (2006, 2008) and Matt Scott (2010, 2013), while Johnathan Thurston, was the first player to win the award four times (2005, 2012, 2014, 2015). The first recipient of the medal was Wayne Sing in 1995.

In 2014, the Cowboys won their first major trophy, the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines tournament which was held at Eden Park in Auckland, defeating the Brisbane Broncos 16–7 in the final. A year later the Cowboys won their first NRL premiership, defeating the Broncos 17–16 in golden point extra time. Johnathan Thurston was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal.

In 2020, the Cowboys won the NRL Nines for the second time, becoming the first club to do so. They defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons 23–14 in the final with Scott Drinkwater being named the Player of the Tournament.

==Statistics and records==

After a 10-year finals drought, the Cowboys made their first finals appearance in 2004, finishing one game away from the grand final. The following year the team played in their first grand final, losing to the Wests Tigers. The North Queensland club&#x27;s second appearance in the grand final would not come for another 10 years, when they met Queensland rivals, Brisbane Broncos, in the 2015 decider. In one of the most entertaining grand finals in living memory, Johnathan Thurston kicked a golden-point field goal to win the Cowboys their maiden premiership.

The club&#x27;s Under 20s side finished runners-up in the 2011 NYC grand final to the New Zealand Warriors while their feeder teams have won the Queensland Cup four times. In 2005 with the North Queensland Young Guns, 2010 and 2014 with the Northern Pride and 2013 with the Mackay Cutters.

Fullback Matthew Bowen currently holds the record for most first grade games and most tries for club. Bowen also holds the club record for most tries in a season, with 22 in 2007. Paul Bowman became the first Cowboy to play 200 first grade games in 2007. Johnathan Thurston jointly holds the record for most points in a match with Josh Hannay at 24. Hannay&#x27;s 10 goals against South Sydney in 2003. Johnathan Thurston currently holds the most points in a season in 2014 with 234 points. Winger Ray Mercy was the first, and so far only, Cowboy to score four tries in a match, which he did against Balmain in 1998.

The club&#x27;s biggest winning margin is 74 points, achieved in 2023 in a 74 - 0 victory over the Wests Tigers. Their heaviest defeat is a 62–0 loss by the Parramatta Eels in 2001.

==Stadium==

From 1995 to 2019, the Cowboys played their home games at Willows Sports Complex, located in the Townsville suburb of Kirwan. Prior to 1995, the venue hosted trotting paceway nights, and was the main pacing venue for the Townsville District, but due to the admittance of the Cowboys, the venue was turned into a rugby league stadium.

The venue was renamed Stockland Stadium in 1995, due to sponsorship rights, and attracted a crowd of 23,156 to the Cowboys first ever premiership game. In 1998, the name was changed to Malanda Stadium by new sponsors Dairy Farmers, before being renamed again in 1999 to Dairy Farmers Stadium. The stadium underwent major renovations in 2005 and 2006, with the eastern, northern and southern grandstands receiving upgrades, the addition of more corporate boxes and a new replay screen and public address system installed. Dairy Farmers 15-year partnership with the Cowboys ended at the end of 2012 season, as the club looked for a new naming rights sponsor for the stadium.

In 2013, the stadium was renamed 1300SMILES Stadium, after the Townsville-based dental practice entered into a five-year sponsorship deal with Stadiums Queensland. On 29 August 2019, the club played their final game at the stadium, defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 15–8.

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 30,302, set against the Brisbane Broncos in the round 8 of the 1999 season. The record attendance for a finals match is 24,989, set against the Brisbane Broncos in week 2 of the 2004 finals series.

In 2020, the club moved to the new 25,000-seat Queensland Country Bank Stadium in South Townsville.

==Training base==

In 2021, the Cowboys opened a new training and administration base, known as the Hutchinson Builders Centre for sponsorship reasons, adjacent to Queensland Country Bank Stadium.

Before becoming the Cowboys, the team names Marlins, Stingrays and the very popular Crocodiles were tossed up as potential team logos for the side, before public consultation resulted in the name &#x27;Cowboys&#x27; (the Crocodiles name would eventually go to Townsville&#x27;s National Basketball League team, who changed their name to the Townsville Crocodiles in 1998 after a dispute with the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns over their original name, the Townsville Suns). The colours navy blue and yellow were chosen to reflect the colours of the Townsville representative sides. Grey was also added as primary colour with white introduced as a secondary colour.

===Logos===

The club&#x27;s &quot;steer head&quot; logo has stayed basically the same since 1995. In the early years the logo was on a white rectangular background, before being backed with a yellow oval. In 2003 the font was changed and a yellow star added, which remain to this day. A lighter shade of navy blue and white were also added to the logo. In 2020, the club introduced a new logo to celebrate their 25th season.

===Primary Jerseys===

The Cowboys&#x27; home jerseys have stayed predominantly navy blue over the years, with white, grey and yellow all being the predominant secondary colour at some stage, with the away jerseys predominantly white. Since 2011, the club has also worn special jerseys for Women in League round, Indigenous round and an Anzac/Defence force-themed jersey for games played on Anzac weekend.

==Rivalries==
North Queensland&#x27;s main rivals are the Brisbane Broncos. From 1999 to 2006, the two clubs were the only Queensland-based sides in the NRL. A one-side rivalry for nearly 10 years, the Brisbane side had not lost to North Queensland in 16 encounters. In 2004, the teams met in the finals for the first time, with North Queensland defeating Brisbane 10–0, to record their first win in the derby.

In the final round of the 2020 NRL season, North Queensland condemned Brisbane to their first ever Wooden Spoon. Brisbane needed to win the match to overtake Canterbury-Bankstown but lost the match. As of 2020, the sides have met five more times in the finals, including the 2015 NRL Grand Final, the first all-Queensland Grand Final, which North Queensland won 17–16 in extra time. The rivalry between the two clubs is considered one of the best in modern rugby league.

The club had a minor competitive rivalry with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks The games with Cronulla grew from finals football, with the two clubs meeting five times in the finals since 2013. From 2023, the player of the match in games between the two clubs has been awarded the Paul Green Medal, in honour of Paul Green, a former player for both clubs and coach for the Cowboys who died in 2022.

==Women&#x27;s team==

On 15 June 2022, the Cowboys were admitted to the NRL Women&#x27;s Premiership for the 2023 season. On 24 November 2022, Ben Jeffries was announced as the club&#x27;s inaugural NRLW head coach, with Anita Creenaune appointed as Head of Women&#x27;s Elite Programs. On 4 April 2023, Mackay&#x27;s Emma Manzelmann became the club&#x27;s inaugural signing.

<doc id="995016" wikidata="Q7696090" url="?curid=995016" title="Telecommunications rating">
<text>In telecommunications rating is the activity of determining the cost of a particular call. The rating process involves converting call-related data into a monetary-equivalent value.

Call-related data is generated at various points in the network or measurements may be taken by third party equipment such as network probes. Generally this data is something quantifiable and specific. The usage data so gathered is then either packaged by the equipment or it may be sent to a charging gateway.etc.

Rating systems typically use some or all of the following types of data about a call:

* Time property of the call (day of week, date, time of day)
* Amount of usage (Duration of call, amount of data, number of messages, number of songs)
* Destination of the call (land line, overseas, etc.)
* Origin of call/ Location of the caller (for mobile networks)
* Premium charges (third party charges for premium content, cost of physical items such as movie tickets)

Generally individual calls are rated and then the rated amounts are sent to a billing system to provide a bill to the subscriber. Often the rating system will be a module of a larger &quot;Billing System&quot; architecture.

A rating system must be adapted to the constantly changing pricing policies, which have the strategic goal of stimulating demand.

==Data structures==
To perform the rating calculations it is necessary to produce a Call detail record/EDR. A Call detail record (CDR, also known as &quot;Call Data Record&quot;) is &quot;a record of a call setup and completion&quot;, and its format &quot;varies among telecom providers or programs&quot;, which some allow to be configured by the user.

EDR stands for &quot;Event Data/Detail Record&quot;. EDR records are used for systems that charge more than calls - content. e.g. buying ring tones. The generated CDR/EDR may not be in a form suitable for the particular rating system. In this case a piece of software, known as the mediation system, may be required to render the data into a form useful by the rating system. The mediation system is also useful for gathering data from various sources to aggregate into one record.

In spoken language CDR usually refers to any type of record: voice, SMS or data.

==Design choices: support for non programming configuration==
In complex systems there&#x27;s the need of the flexibility to modify and maintain the system by an interface more human-readable than programming code, like editing tables where the behavior of the system is defined. This allows both a quicker editing and the possibility to let the configuration and maintenance of the system to non programmers, like business/tariff analysts. This flexibility comes at the cost of a heavier computational time. The support for &quot;code external&quot; textual configuration of both rating cases-amounts and the algorithmic rating process steps, is sometimes called &quot;Rule-based Rating&quot;. Rule-based rating is one simple example of the use of the more general control table technique.

As the telecommunications market comes under increasing pressure from new technologies (for example WiMAX), the leading differentiating factors between competing operators is often the innovation in new product offerings, and time to market. This leads to a natural tension between the capabilities that are offered by:
* conventional configuration only systems (in which the products one operator can configure can also be offered by another),
* rule based systems (in which new offerings can be created more easily, but performance considerations might not allow these to be offered to mass markets), and
* programmed systems (in which you can create many more innovations, but the time to market and cost of implementation may be higher).

In real life situations, even the most configurable systems generally have an implementation phase, in which new capabilities are created using programming methods, and a configuration phase, in which the new capabilities are configured and offered to the mass market.

==Complex rating==

As competition increased in the telecommunications space, rating is getting increasingly complex. Some rating scenarios use multiple measurements.

Example:
:Rating for a video download may involve measuring the number of minutes, the amount of data, the quality of data transfer as identified by the service level agreement (SLA) and the usage (copyright) cost of the video.

Example:

:A data session representing viewing a video-on-demand session, with a one-off charge, should not charge the user for the data volume since it was already charged for the video. These two charging events are correlated and the data volume spent on streaming video isn&#x27;t charged to the user&#x27;s data bundle/account.

Complex rating could also involve non-network related parameters. Some of the rating data may come from the customer care or billing sub-systems.

Example:
:When usage above a certain amount is triggered in the billing sub-system the rating engine may assign a lower rate for the user. This is also known as an adjusting rate and can be complex to model in certain systems.

Complex rating behaviour could be due to particular real or virtual behaviour.

Example:
:Subscribers who play an affiliated on line game may trade in-game currency or equipment or incentive tokens for discounted calls to other players of the game.

Among the issues of rating that are unexpected sources of complexity is Daylight Saving Time time offsets.

==Neutral currency rating==

Modern rating engines may also be currency neutral. Certain multi-national telecommunication providers provide the ability for subscribers settlement in multiple currencies. In this scenario the rating engine generates a currency neutral billing record. It is the billing engine which is assigned with converting the virtual currency into an actualized cost.

==Re-rating==

In some scenarios it may be necessary to re-rate calls but not all rating engines are capable of this. There is a philosophical argument as to the usefulness of re-rating, with no clear correct answer:

===Pro re-rating===
* It is useful to be able to correct errors that are identified.
* The calculation of complex discounts may not be possible until all the calls for a billing cycle have been received.
* Re-rating solves problems with CDRs arriving late. The flow of CDRs that reach the rating processes often can not be relied on to deliver the calls in the order in which they are needed for customer access to their billing information. When you charge for services provided by other providers (for example, international calls made while roaming in another carrier&#x27;s region, services billed to your home number from a pay phone or other remote location), these CDRs may be delayed and arrive out of the order expected in the reporting of usage to customers. When usage records arrive out of order, you may need to re-rate previously received usage records.

===Against re-rating===
* The pro re-rating arguments are in fact based on a dying paradigm: Billing is done in a batch system, and the customer has no access to the un-billed information. This is not really the case any more:
** Modern billing systems are convergent (they can handle real time and batch rating on the same platform at the same time). Re-rating is not possible for real time events, because they would no longer be real time by definition
** Modern billing systems with self-care interfaces (so that the customer can see their charges on a web site in near real-time) means that re-rating is not possible. It would be unacceptable for the customer to see one price one day, and a different one later
** Re-rating must be completed before the bill production, which is usually monthly. It is sometimes not possible to perform re-rating for all the CDRs that should be re-rated, because the billing cycle is already closed. A closed bill is a legal document and cannot under any circumstances be modified
* There is a natural wastefulness in re-rating: Telecommunications hardware is expensive, and should normally be exploited near to its capacity to maximise the return on investment. Re-rating means that extra capacity must be purchased, and will usually not be used.
* Re-rating is often seen as a safety net for human error. However, if there is a safety net, errors are more likely to occur, and testing and planning may decrease in quality and thoroughness

<doc id="995019" wikidata="Q5357201" url="?curid=995019" title="Mass gap">
<text>In quantum field theory, the mass gap is the difference in energy between the lowest energy state, the vacuum, and the next lowest energy state. The energy of the vacuum is zero by definition, and assuming that all energy states can be thought of as particles in plane-waves, the mass gap is the mass of the lightest particle.

Since the energies of exact (i.e. nonperturbative) energy eigenstates are spread out and therefore are not technically eigenstates, a more precise definition is that the mass gap is the greatest lower bound of the energy of any state which is orthogonal to the vacuum.

The analog of a mass gap in many-body physics on a discrete lattice arises from a gapped Hamiltonian.

==Mathematical definitions==
For a given real-valued quantum field formula_1, where formula_2, we can say that the theory has a mass gap if the two-point function has the property

formula_3

with formula_4 being the lowest energy value in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and thus the mass gap. This quantity, easy to generalize to other fields, is what is generally measured in lattice computations. It was proved in this way that Yang–Mills theory develops a mass gap on a lattice. The corresponding time-ordered value, the propagator, will have the property

formula_5

with the constant being finite. A typical example is offered by a free massive particle and, in this case, the constant has the value 1/&quot;m&quot;2. In the same limit, the propagator for a massless particle is singular.

==Examples from classical theories==
An example of mass gap arising for massless theories, already at the classical level, can be seen in spontaneous breaking of symmetry or the Higgs mechanism. In the former case, one has to cope with the appearance of massless excitations, Goldstone bosons, that are removed in the latter case due to gauge freedom. Quantization preserves this gauge freedom property.

A quartic massless scalar field theory develops a mass gap already at classical level. Consider the equation

formula_6

This equation has the exact solution

formula_7
—where formula_8 and formula_9 are integration constants, and sn is a Jacobi elliptic function—provided

formula_10

At the classical level, a mass gap appears while, at quantum level, one has a tower of excitations, and this property of the theory is preserved after quantization in the limit of momenta going to zero.

==Yang–Mills theory==
While lattice computations have suggested that Yang–Mills theory indeed has a mass gap and a tower of excitations, a theoretical proof is still missing. This is one of the Clay Institute Millennium problems and it remains an open problem. Such states for Yang–Mills theory should be physical states, named glueballs, and should be observable in the laboratory.

==Källén–Lehmann representation==
If Källén–Lehmann spectral representation holds, at this stage we exclude gauge theories, the spectral density function can take a very simple form with a discrete spectrum starting with a mass gap

formula_11

being formula_12 the contribution from multi-particle part of the spectrum. In this case, the propagator will take the simple form

formula_13

being formula_14 approximatively the starting point of the multi-particle sector. Now, using the fact that

formula_15

we arrive at the following conclusion for the constants in the spectral density

formula_16.

This could not be true in a gauge theory. Rather it must be proved that a Källén–Lehmann representation for the propagator holds also for this case. Absence of multi-particle contributions implies that the theory is trivial, as no bound states appear in the theory and so there is no interaction, even if the theory has a mass gap. In this case we have immediately the propagator just setting formula_17 in the formulas above.

<text>Florence Owens Thompson (born Florence Leona Christie; September 1, 1903 – September 16, 1983) was an American woman who was the subject of Dorothea Lange&#x27;s photograph &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; (1936), considered an iconic image of the Great Depression. The Library of Congress titled the image: &quot;Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age thirty-two. Nipomo, California.&quot; Thompson was called the &quot;Mona Lisa of the 1930s.&quot;

==Biography==
Florence Owens Thompson was born Florence Leona Christie on September 1, 1903, in Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. Both of her parents claimed Cherokee descent. Her father, Jackson Christie, allegedly abandoned her mother, Mary Jane Cobb, before she was born, and her mother married Charles Akman (of Choctaw descent) in the spring of 1905. The family lived on a small farm in Indian Territory outside Tahlequah. Cherokee Nation tribal records indicate that Jackson Christie&#x27;s blood quantum was either full blood or one-half. Mary Jane Cobb claimed she was Cherokee on her May 27, 1894, marriage record to Christie, but later testified under oath before the Dawes Commission that both of her parents were white. While many sources claim Christie abandoned Cobb, he disputed the allegation. Christie served three years in a federal penitentiary in Detroit, Michigan.

Aged 17, Thompson married Cleo Owens, a farmer&#x27;s 23-year-old son from Stone County, Missouri, on February 14, 1921. They soon had their first daughter, Violet, followed by a second daughter, Viola, and a son, Leroy (Troy). The family migrated west with other Owens relatives to Oroville, California, where they worked in the saw mills and on the farms of the Sacramento Valley. By 1931, Thompson was pregnant with her sixth child, when her husband Cleo died of tuberculosis.

Thompson then worked in the fields and in restaurants to support her six children. In 1933, Thompson had another child, returned to Oklahoma for a time, and then was joined by her parents as they migrated to Shafter, California, north of Bakersfield. There, Thompson met Jim Hill, with whom she had three more children. During the 1930s, the family worked as migrant farm workers following the crops in California and at times into Arizona. Thompson later recalled periods when she picked of cotton from first daylight until after it was too dark to work. She said: &quot;I worked in hospitals. I tended bar. I cooked. I worked in the fields. I done a little bit of everything to make a living for my kids.&quot;

The family settled in Modesto, California, in 1945. Well after World War II, Thompson met and married hospital administrator George Thompson. This marriage brought her far greater financial security than she had previously enjoyed.

==&quot;Migrant Mother&quot;==

On March 6, 1936, after picking beets in the Imperial Valley, Thompson and her family were traveling on U.S. Highway 101 towards Watsonville &quot;where they had hoped to find work in the lettuce fields of the Pajaro Valley.&quot; On the road, the car&#x27;s timing chain snapped and they coasted to a stop just inside a pea-pickers&#x27; camp on Nipomo Mesa. They were shocked to find so many people camping there—as many as 2,500 to 3,500. A notice had been sent out for pickers, but the crops had been destroyed by freezing rain, leaving them without work or pay. Years later, Thompson told an interviewer that when she cooked food for her children that day, other children appeared from the pea pickers&#x27; camp asking, &quot;Can I have a bite?&quot;

While Jim Hill, her partner, and two of Thompson&#x27;s sons went into town to get parts to repair the car, Thompson and some of the children set up a temporary camp. As she waited, photographer Dorothea Lange, working for the Resettlement Administration, drove up and started taking photos of Thompson and her family. She took seven images in the course of ten minutes.

Lange&#x27;s field notes for the Resettlement Administration were typically very thorough, but on this particular day she had been rushing to get home after a month on assignment, and the notes she submitted with this batch of negatives do not refer to any of the seven photographs she took of Thompson and her family. It seems that the published newspaper reports about this camp were later distilled into captions for the series, which explains inaccuracies on the file cards in the Library of Congress. For example, one of the file cards reads:
 Twenty-three years later, Lange wrote of the encounter with Thompson:

Troy Owens, one of Thompson&#x27;s sons, recounted:
In many ways, &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; is not typical of Lange&#x27;s careful method of interacting with her subject. Exhausted after a long road-trip, she did not speak extensively to the migrant woman, or Thompson herself, and may not have recorded any notes.

According to Thompson, Lange promised the photos would never be published. Lange, however, sent them to the &quot;San Francisco News&quot; before even sending them to the Resettlement Administration in Washington, D.C. The &quot;San Francisco News&quot; ran the pictures almost immediately and reported that 2,500 to 3,500 migrant workers were starving in Nipomo, California. Within days, the pea-picker camp received of food from the federal government. Thompson and her family had moved on by the time the food arrived, and were working near Watsonville, California.

While Thompson&#x27;s identity was not known for over 40 years after the photos were taken, the photos became famous. The image which later became known as &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; &quot;achieved near mythical status, symbolizing, if not defining, an entire era in United States history&quot;. Roy Stryker called &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; the &quot;ultimate&quot; photo of the Depression Era: &quot;[Lange] never surpassed it. To me, it was the picture ... . The others were marvelous, but that was special ... . She is immortal.&quot; As a whole, the photographs taken for the Resettlement Administration &quot;have been widely heralded as the epitome of documentary photography.&quot; Edward Steichen described them as &quot;the most remarkable human documents ever rendered in pictures.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s identity was discovered in the late 1970s. In 1978, acting on a tip, &quot;Modesto Bee&quot; reporter Emmett Corrigan located Thompson at her mobile home in Space 24 of the Modesto Mobile Village and recognized her from the photograph. Thompson was quoted as saying: &quot;I wish she [Lange] hadn&#x27;t taken my picture. I can&#x27;t get a penny out of it. She didn&#x27;t ask my name. She said she wouldn&#x27;t sell the pictures. She said she&#x27;d send me a copy. She never did.&quot; Having been funded by the Resettlement Administration, the picture was classed as a federal government work and thus public domain, so that Lange was not entitled to royalties. However, the picture did help make her a celebrity and earned her &quot;respect from her colleagues.&quot;

While the image was being prepared for exhibit in 1938, the negative of the photo was retouched to remove Florence&#x27;s thumb from the lower-right corner of the image.

===Circulation===
In the late 1960s, Bill Hendrie found unretouched prints by Lange of &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; and 31 other images from the same series in a dumpster at the San Jose Chamber of Commerce. After the death of Hendrie and his wife, their daughter, Marian Tankersley, rediscovered the photos while emptying her parents&#x27; San Jose home. In October 2005, an anonymous buyer paid $296,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s New York for the set—nearly six times their pre-bid estimate.

In 1998, the retouched photo of &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; became a 32-cent U.S. Postal Service stamp in the 1930s portion of the Celebrate the Century series. The stamp printing was unusual: daughters Katherine McIntosh (on the left in the stamp) and Norma Rydlewski (in Thompson&#x27;s arms in the stamp) were alive at the time of the printing; usually, the Postal Service does not print stamps of individuals who have not been dead for at least 10 years.

In the same month the U.S. stamp was issued, a print of the photograph with Lange&#x27;s handwritten notes and signature sold in 1998 for $244,500 at Sotheby&#x27;s New York. In November 2002, Dorothea Lange&#x27;s personal print of &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for $141,500.

==Later life, death, and aftermath==

Thompson&#x27;s children bought her a house in Modesto, California, in the 1970s, but she preferred living in a mobile home and moved back into one.

Thompson was hospitalized and her family appealed for financial help in late August 1983. By September, the family had collected $35,000 in donations to pay for her medical care. Thompson died of &quot;stroke, cancer and heart problems&quot; at Scotts Valley, California, on September 16, 1983, at age 80. She was buried in Lakewood Memorial Park, in Hughson, California, and her gravestone reads: &quot;FLORENCE LEONA THOMPSON Migrant Mother – A Legend of the Strength of American Motherhood.&quot;

In a 2008 interview with CNN, one of Thompson&#x27;s daughters, Katherine McIntosh, recalled her mother as a &quot;very strong lady&quot;, and &quot;the backbone of our family&quot;. She said: &quot;We never had a lot, but she always made sure we had something. She didn&#x27;t eat sometimes, but she made sure us children ate. That&#x27;s one thing she did do.&quot; A son, Troy Owens, said that more than 2,000 letters received along with donations for his mother&#x27;s medical fund led to a re-appraisal of the photo: &quot;For Mama and us, the photo had always been a bit of [a] curse. After all those letters came in, I think it gave us a sense of pride.&quot;

==Other six photographs==
Lange took seven photos that day, the last being &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;. The following are the six other photos:

<text>Robert Benjamin &quot;Speck&quot; Searcy, Jr. (January 8, 1901 – December 22, 1967) was an American politician who served as mayor of Huntsville, Alabama from 1952 to 1964.

He was the mayor of Huntsville when President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as the home for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on July 1, 1960. The center became the civilian base for Dr. Wernher von Braun who was the center&#x27;s first Director, presiding from July 1960 to February 1970.

Searcy is buried at Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.

<text>Pierre Alphonse de Tonty, Alfonso de Tonti, or Alphonse de Tonty, Baron de Paludy (c. 1659 – 10 November 1727) was an officer who served under the French explorer Cadillac and helped establish the first European settlement at Detroit, Michigan, Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit on the Detroit River in 1701. Several months later, both Cadillac and Tonty brought their wives to the fort, making them the first European women to travel so deep into the new territory.

He was born in Paris, ca. 1659, to Lorenzo de Tonti who was a financier and former governor of Gaeta who was in France in exile. Lorenzo de Tonti was the inventor of the form of life insurance known as the tontine. Henri de Tonti, involved in LaSalle&#x27;s exploration of the Mississippi River and the establishment of the first settlement in Arkansas, was his older brother.

Tonty was commanding the fort in Detroit by 1717, but by 1727 numerous complaints, including those by the Huron led to his dismissal.

Tonty was involved in numerous scandals and disreputable activities before he was eventually dismissed from his post as commandant of Fort Pontchartrain. He died before he could obtain another appointment or return to France.

Tonty was married twice. His first marriage in 1689 was to Marie Anne Picoté de Belestre with whom he had 13 children. She was the daughter of Pierre Picoté de Belestre.

<text>Alonso Lobo (February 25, 1555 (baptised) – April 5, 1617) was a Spanish composer of the late Renaissance. Although not as famous as Tomás Luis de Victoria, he was highly regarded at the time, and Victoria himself considered him to be his equal.

==Biography==

Lobo was born in Osuna, and after being a choirboy at the cathedral in Seville, he received a degree at the University of Osuna, and took a position as a canon at a church in Osuna sometime before 1591. In that year, the Seville Cathedral appointed him as assistant to Francisco Guerrero, and he later became &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; during Guerrero&#x27;s leave of absence. In 1593, Toledo Cathedral hired him as &quot;maestro de capilla&quot;; he remained there until 1604, when he returned to Seville, where he died.

Lobo&#x27;s music combines the smooth contrapuntal technique of Palestrina with the sombre intensity of Victoria. Some of his music also uses polychoral techniques, which were common in Italy around 1600, though Lobo never used more than two choirs (contemporary choral music of the Venetian school often used many more — the Gabrielis often wrote for as many choirs as there were choir-lofts at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica). Lobo was influential far beyond the borders of his native Spain: in Portugal, and as far away as Mexico, for the next hundred years or more he was considered to be one of the finest Spanish composers.

His works include masses and motets, three Passion settings, Lamentations, psalms and hymns, as well as a Miserere for 12 voices (which has since become lost). His best-known work, &quot;Versa est in luctum&quot;, was written on the death of Philip II in 1598. No secular or instrumental music by Lobo is known to survive today.

<doc id="995055" wikidata="Q157552" url="?curid=995055" title="Primula veris">
<text>Primula veris, the cowslip, common cowslip, or cowslip primrose (syn. &quot;Primula officinalis&quot; ), is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the primrose family Primulaceae. The species is native throughout most of temperate Europe and western Asia, and although absent from more northerly areas including much of northwest Scotland, it reappears in northernmost Sutherland and Orkney and in Scandinavia. This species frequently hybridizes with other &quot;Primulas&quot; such as the common primrose &quot;Primula vulgaris&quot; to form false oxlip (&quot;Primula&quot; × &quot;polyantha&quot;) which is often confused with true oxlip (&quot;Primula elatior&quot;), a much rarer plant.

==Names==
The common name &quot;cowslip&quot; may derive from the old English for cow dung, probably because the plant was often found growing amongst the manure in cow pastures. An alternative derivation simply refers to slippery or boggy ground; again, a typical habitat for this plant. The name &quot;cowslop&quot; derived from Old English still exists in some dialects, but the politer-sounding cowslip became standard in the 16th century.

The species name &quot;veris&quot; (&#x27;of spring&#x27;, referring to the season) is the genitive case form of Latin (&#x27;spring&#x27;). However, primrose &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;, flowers earlier, from December to May in the British Isles.

Other historical common names include cuy lippe, herb peter, paigle or pagil, peggle, key flower, key of heaven, fairy cups, petty mulleins, crewel, buckles, palsywort, and plumrocks.

==Description==

&quot;Primula veris&quot; is a variable evergreen or semi-evergreen perennial plant growing to tall and broad, with a rosette of leaves 5–15 cm long and 2–6 cm broad. The deep yellow flowers are produced in spring, in clusters of 10–30 blooms together on a single stem. Each flower is 9–15 mm broad. Red- and orange-flowered plants occur rarely but can be locally widespread in areas where coloured primula hybrids bloom at the same time as the native cowslip, enabling cross-pollination.

==Distribution and habitat==

The cowslip is frequently found on more open ground than the primrose, including open fields, meadows, coastal dunes, and clifftops.

==Conservation==
The plant suffered a decline due to changing agricultural practices throughout the 1970s and 1980s in Britain. It may therefore be rare locally, though where found it may be abundant. Additionally the seeds are now often included in wildflower seed mixes used to landscape motorway banks and similar civil engineering earthworks where the plants may be seen in dense stands. This practice has led to a revival in its fortunes.

==Cultivation==
In cultivation this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Similar species==

The cowslip may be confused with the closely related &quot;Primula elatior&quot; (oxlip) which has a similar general appearance and habitat, although the oxlip has larger, pale yellow flowers more like a primrose, and a corolla tube without folds.

==Chemical constituents==
The roots of &quot;Primula veris&quot; contain several glycosides of 5-methoxysalicylic methyl ester, such as primeverin and primulaverin. In the crude dried root, their phenolic aglycones are responsible for the typical odour reminiscent of methyl salicylate or anethole. The dried roots contain significant amounts of triterpene saponins, such as primula acid I/II, while in the flower these constituents are located in the sepals, and the dominating constituents are flavonoids. Rare side effects of the saponins can be nausea or diarrhoea while some of the phenolic constituents are possibly responsible for allergic reactions.

The subspecies &quot;macrocalyx&quot;, growing in Siberia, contains the phenolic compound riccardin C.

==Cuisine==
Cowslip leaves have been traditionally used in Spanish cooking as a salad green. Uses in English cookery include using the flowers to flavor country wine and vinegars; sugaring to be a sweet or eaten as part of a composed salad while the juice of the cowslip is used to prepare tansy for frying. The close cousin of the cowslip, the primrose &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; has often been confused with the cowslip and its uses in cuisine are similar with the addition of its flowers being used as a colouring agent in desserts.

English children&#x27;s writer Alison Uttley in her story &quot;The Country Child&quot; (1931) of family life on an English farm from the perspective of a 9-year-old farmer&#x27;s daughter Susan describes cowslips among the favourite flowers of her heroine and mentions her participation in preparing them for making cowslip wine, a locally important process. After its initial preparation, cowslip wine &quot;would change to sparkling yellow wine&quot; offered in &quot;little fluted glasses&quot; with a biscuit to important &quot;morning visitors&quot; of the farm: such as the curate coming for subscriptions, the local squire (landowner) and an occasional dealer (of their produce). This wine &quot;was more precious than elderberry wine, which was the drink for cold weather, for snow and sleet&quot;.
 In the midland and southern counties of England, a sweet and pleasant wine resembling the muscadel is made from the cowslip flower, and it is one of the most wholesome and pleasant of home-made wines, and slightly narcotic in its effects. In times when English wines were more used, every housewife in Warwickshire could produce her clear cowslip wine…the cowslip is still sold in many markets for this purpose, and little cottage girls still ramble the meadows during April and May in search of it…country people use it as a salad or boil it for the table. Anne Pratt

==Myth and folklore==
This herb was already mentioned by Pliny the Elder for its early blooming attributes. Species from the genus &quot;Primula&quot; along with other ritual plants played a significant role in the pharmacy and mythology of the Celtic druids, likely as an ingredient of magical potions to increase the absorption of other herbal constituents. In the Middle-Ages it was also known as St. Peter&#x27;s herb or Petrella and was sought after by Florentine apothecaries. Hildegard von Bingen recommended the medicinal parts only for topical use but the leaves were also consumed as food. Other common names at the time were &#x27;Herba paralysis&#x27;, &#x27;Verbascum&#x27;, primrose, or mullein leaves. It was frequently misidentified as or confused with similar species from the genus &quot;Primula&quot;.

<text>Trace Beaulieu () is an American comedian, puppeteer, writer, and actor. He is known for his roles on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;) as well as his work with MST3K&#x27;s successor &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; with the original creators and cast of MST3K.

Beaulieu briefly attended the University of Minnesota.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
For the first eight seasons of &quot;MST3K&quot; (1 at KTMA and 7 on Comedy Channel/Comedy Central), Beaulieu wrote for the show, operated and voiced the Crow T. Robot puppet, and played the role of Dr. Clayton Forrester, the head mad scientist at Gizmonic Institute. After the season five departure of series creator Joel Hodgson, the name of Dr. Forrester&#x27;s company was changed to Deep 13 because Hodgson held the copyright for the word &quot;Gizmonic&quot; and requested that the show refrain from using the word after his departure. At the end of a truncated seventh season, Beaulieu left the series. Pearl Forrester (Mary Jo Pehl) replaced him as the head mad scientist and Bill Corbett took over the voicing and operation of Crow.

==Work after &quot;MST3K&quot;==
Beaulieu appeared as a semi-regular in &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; as the school&#x27;s biology teacher, Mr. Lacovara. He also appeared in &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. Beaulieu was a writer for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; from 1998 to 2007. In 2002, he was the head writer, producer, and host of the pilot episode of the Animal Planet show &quot;People Traps&quot;. He has since starred in the 2010 computer game &quot;&quot; as first officer Ross Perryman. In 2013, he reprised his role as Crow for a brief cameo appearance in two episodes of the fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, along with Joel. In 2015, Beaulieu appeared as ART in the Yahoo! original comedy series, &quot;Other Space&quot;.

Outside of acting, Beaulieu also wrote the script for the one-shot comic book &quot;Here Come the Big People&quot;, published by Event Comics. In 2010, Beaulieu completed work on a children&#x27;s poetry book, &quot;Silly Rhymes for Belligerent Children&quot;, a dark, twisted, humorous collection illustrated by Len Peralta.

In 2014 Beaulieu released a musical short film entitled &quot;The Frank&quot; with the original MST3K cast, including Bill Corbett, who assumed the role of Crow after Beaulieu left MST3K. (Joel Hodgson appears in &quot;The Frank&quot; only as a voice-over, while a stand-in wears Joel&#x27;s trademark red jumpsuit; Michael J. Nelson performs the same voiceover in the color version of &quot;The Frank&quot; available as a DVD extra.)

Beaulieu appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast on June 16, 2016.

Beaulieu was the co-host of &quot;Movie Sign with the Mads&quot; on the Last Podcast Network with Frank Conniff and Carolina Hidalgo from 2016 until 2020. They discussed current and classic movies.

==&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;==
On October 30, 2007, Joel Hodgson announced he was starting a new series—distributed on DVD—with the same &quot;riffing on bad movies&quot; premise as &quot;MST3K&quot;. Called &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, it featured several former &quot;MST3K&quot; cast and crew members: Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.

&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; completed its final tour on December 30, 2013.

==&quot;The Mads Are Back&quot; tour==
Since 2015, Beaulieu has joined his former MST3K co-star Frank Conniff (&quot;TV&#x27;s Frank&quot;) and gone on tour as &quot;The Mads Are Back&quot;, riffing older B-movies in front of live audiences. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Beaulieu and Conniff moved the show to a ticketed livestream format, offering monthly live-riffs of movies, including some they had previously screened on tour such as &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;, &quot;The Tingler&quot;, and &quot;Walk The Dark Street&quot;.

<text>Erik D. Demaine (born February 28, 1981) is a Canadian-American professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former child prodigy.

== Early life and education ==
Demaine was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to mathematician and sculptor Martin L. Demaine and Judy Anderson. From the age of 7, he was identified as a child prodigy and spent time traveling across North America with his father. He was home-schooled during that time span until entering university at the age of 12.

Demaine completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at 14 years of age at Dalhousie University in Canada, and completed his PhD at the University of Waterloo by the time he was 20 years old.
Demaine&#x27;s PhD dissertation, a work in the field of computational origami, was completed at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Anna Lubiw and Ian Munro. This work was awarded the Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Gold Medal from the University of Waterloo and the NSERC Doctoral Prize (2003) for the best PhD thesis and research in Canada. Some of the work from this thesis was later incorporated into his book &quot;Geometric Folding Algorithms&quot; on the mathematics of paper folding published with Joseph O&#x27;Rourke in 2007.

== Professional accomplishments ==

Demaine joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2001 at age 20, reportedly the youngest professor in the history of MIT, and was promoted to full professorship in 2011. Demaine is a member of the Theory of Computation group at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Mathematical origami artwork by Erik and Martin Demaine was part of the &quot;Design and the Elastic Mind&quot; exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 2008, and has been included in the MoMA permanent collection. That same year, he was one of the featured artists in &quot;Between the Folds&quot;, an international documentary film about origami practitioners which was later broadcast on PBS television. In connection with a 2012 exhibit, three of his curved origami artworks with Martin Demaine are in the permanent collection of the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum.

Demaine was a fan of Martin Gardner and in 2001 he teamed up with his father Martin Demaine and Gathering 4 Gardner founder Tom M. Rodgers to edit a tribute book for Gardner on his 90th birthday. From 2016 to 2020 he was president of the board of directors of Gathering 4 Gardner.

==Honours and awards==
In 2003, Demaine was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, known colloquially as the &quot;genius grant&quot;.

In 2013, Demaine received the EATCS Presburger Award for young scientists. The award citation listed accomplishments including his work on the carpenter&#x27;s rule problem, hinged dissection, prefix sum data structures, competitive analysis of binary search trees, graph minors, and computational origami. That same year, he was awarded a fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

For his work on bidimensionality, he was the winner of the Nerode Prize in 2015 along with his co-authors Fedor Fomin, Mohammad T. Hajiaghayi, and Dimitrios Thilikos. The work was the study of a general technique for developing both fixed-parameter tractable exact algorithms and approximation algorithms for a class of algorithmic problems on graphs.

In 2016, he became a fellow at the Association for Computing Machinery. He was given an honorary doctorate by Bard College in 2017.

<doc id="995064" wikidata="Q4056445" url="?curid=995064" title="Automated attendant">
<text>In telephony, an automated attendant (also auto attendant, auto-attendant, autoattendant, automatic phone menus, AA, or virtual receptionist) allows callers to be automatically transferred to an extension without the intervention of an operator/receptionist. Many AAs will also offer a simple menu system (&quot;for sales, press 1, for service, press 2,&quot; etc.). An auto attendant may also allow a caller to reach a live operator by dialing a number, usually &quot;0&quot;. Typically the auto attendant is included in a business&#x27;s phone system such as a PBX, but some services allow businesses to use an AA without such a system. Modern AA services (which now overlap with more complicated interactive voice response or IVR systems) can route calls to mobile phones, VoIP virtual phones, other AAs/IVRs, or other locations using traditional land-line phones or voice message machines.

==Feature description==

Telephone callers will recognize an automated attendant system as one that greets calls incoming to an organization with a recorded greeting of the form, &quot;Thank you for calling ... If you know your party&#x27;s extension, you may dial it any time during this message.&quot; Callers who have a touch-tone (DTMF) phone can dial an extension number or, in most cases, wait for operator (&quot;attendant&quot;) assistance. Since the telephone network does not transmit the DC signals from rotary dial telephones (except for audible clicks), callers who have rotary dial phones have to wait for assistance.

On a purely technical level it could be argued that an automated attendant is a very simple kind of IVR however, in the telecom industry the terms &quot;IVR&quot; and &quot;auto attendant&quot; are generally considered distinct. An automated attendant serves a very specific purpose (replace live operator and route calls), whereas an IVR can perform all sorts of functions (telephone banking, account inquiries, etc.).

An AA will often include a directory which will allow a caller to dial by name in order to find a user on a system. There is no standard format to these directories, and they can use combinations of first name, last name, or both. 

The following lists common routing steps that are components of an automated attendant:
* Transfer to extension
* Transfer to voicemail
* Play message (i.e., &quot;our address is ...&quot;)
* Go to a sub-menu
* Repeat choices

In addition, an automated attendant would be expected to have values for the following:

* &#x27;0&#x27; - where to go when the caller dials &#x27;0&#x27;
* Timeout - what to do if the caller does nothing (usually go to the same place as &#x27;0&#x27;)
* Default mailbox - where to send calls if &#x27;0&#x27; is not answered (or is not pointing to a live person)

==Background==

PBXs (private branch exchanges) or PABXs (private automatic branch exchanges) are telephone systems that serve an organization that has many telephone extensions but fewer telephone lines (sometimes called &quot;trunks&quot;) that connect that organization to the rest of the global telecommunications network.

While persons within an enterprise served by a PBX can call each other by dialing their extension numbers, incoming calls, i.e., calls originating from a telephone not served by the PBX but intended for a party served by the PBX, required assistance from a switchboard operator (also called a &quot;switchboard attendant&quot;) or a telephone service called DID (&quot;direct inward dialing&quot;). Direct inward dialing has advantages such as rapid connection to the destination party and disadvantages including cost, lack of identification of the called organization and use of ten-digit telephone numbers.

Automated attendants provide, among many other things, a way for an external caller to be directed to an extension or department served by a PBX system without using direct inward dialing or without switchboard attendant assistance.

==History==

Automated attendants are not part of voicemail systems. Voice messaging (or voicemail or VM) technology has existed since the late 1970s; in the early 1980s companies provided voice-prompting systems that allowed callers to reach (route the call) to an intended party, not necessarily to leave a message. Automated attendant systems are also referred to as automated menu systems and much early work in this field was done by Michael J. Freeman, Ph.D.

==Time-based routing==

Many auto attendants will have options to allow for time-of-day routing, as well as weekend and holiday routing. The specifics of these features will depend entirely on the particular automated attendant, but typically there would be a normal greeting and routing steps that would take place during normal business hours, and a different greeting and routing for non-business hours.

<doc id="995070" wikidata="Q1935270" url="?curid=995070" title="Aztec warfare">
<text>Aztec warfare concerns the aspects associated with the military conventions, forces, weaponry and strategic expansions conducted by the Late Postclassic Aztec civilizations of Mesoamerica, including particularly the military history of the Aztec Triple Alliance involving the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan and other allied polities of the central Mexican region. This united the Mexica, Apulteca, and Chichimeca people through marriages.

The Aztec armed forces were typically made up of a small number people ranging from 10-15 people of commoners (&quot;yāōquīzqueh&quot; , &quot;those who have gone to war&quot;) who possessed extensive military training, and a smaller but still considerable number of highly professional warriors belonging to the nobility (&quot;pīpiltin&quot; ) and who were organized into warrior societies and ranked according to their achievements. The Aztec state was in the center on political expansion and dominance of and exaction of tribute from other city states, and warfare was the basic dynamic force in Aztec politics. Aztec society was also centered on warfare: every Aztec male received basic military training from an early age and one of the few possible opportunities of upwards social mobility for commoners (&quot;mācehualtin&quot; ) was through military achievement – especially the taking of captives (&quot;māltin&quot; , singular &quot;malli&quot;). Thus, only specifically chosen men served in the military. The sacrifice of war captives was a very important part of many of the Aztec religious festivals. Warfare was thus the main driving force of both the Aztec economy and religion.

== Warfare in Aztec society ==
There were two main objectives in Aztecs warfare. The first was sacrificing the firstborn: the subjugation of enemy city states (Altepetl) in order to exact tribute and expand Aztec political hegemony. The second objective was religious and socioeconomic: the taking of captives to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. These dual objectives also influenced the kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs. Most warfare was primarily political and was driven by the expectations of the Aztec nobility for the &quot;Tlahtoāni&quot; to provide economic growth through expansion and the expectation of the commoners to have a chance of moving up in society through successful warfare. The first action of a ruler elect was always to stage a military campaign which served the dual purpose of showing his ability as a warrior and thus make it clear to subject polities that his rule would be as tough on any rebellious conduct as that of his predecessor, and to provide abundant captives for his coronation ceremony. A failed coronation campaign was seen as an extremely bad omen for the rule of a Tlatoani and could lead to rebellions of city states subjected by earlier rulers and to the Aztec nobility distrusting his ability to rule – this was the case for Tizoc who was poisoned by the Aztec nobles after several failed military campaigns.

===Flower war===
The second kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs was referred to as flower war (&quot;xōchiyāōyōtl&quot; ). This kind of warfare was fought by ceremonial armies after a previous arrangement between the parties involved. These armies were composed primarily of nobles and the more skilled warriors. It was not aimed directly at the enemy city-state (altepetl) but served a number of other purposes. These wars were a show of power for the competing armies; intimidation played a huge role in Aztec warfare in general. Another often cited purpose is the taking of sacrificial captives and this was certainly an important part of most Aztec warfare. Friar Diego Durán and the chronicles based on the Crónica X states that the Xochiyaoyotl was instigated by Tlacaelel during the great Mesoamerican famine of 1450–1454 under the reign of Moctezuma I. These sources state that Tlacaelel arranged with the leaders of Tlaxcala, Cholula, and Huexotzinco, and Tliliuhquitepec to engage in ritual battles that would provide all parties with enough sacrificial victims to appease the gods. Ross Hassig (1988) however poses four main political purposes of &quot;xochiyaoyotl&quot;:

# This kind of warfare gave the Aztecs a chance to demonstrate their military might. Since the Aztec army was larger than their adversaries that were normally smaller city states and since the numbers of combatants on each side were fixed, the Aztec army was sending a much smaller percentage of their total forces than their opponents. Losing a flower war would then be less damaging for the Aztec army than for its opponents.
# This also meant that an objective was attrition – the large Aztec army could afford to engage in small scale warfare much more frequently than their opponents, who would then gradually tire until they were ripe for actual conquest.
# It also allowed a ruler to maintain hostilities, at low intensity, while occupied by other matters.
# Mainly Xochiyaoyotl served as propaganda both towards other city-states and to the Aztec people allowing the Aztec rulers to continuously demonstrate their might with a constant influx of war captives to Tenochtitlan.
# Most importantly, the flower war served as a function of capturing victims to perform ritual sacrifice. To the east of the growing Aztec empire was the city-state of Tlaxcala. The Tlaxcalans were a powerful people who shared their culture and language with the people of the Aztec empire proper. They were closely related to the empire, though never actually conquered by it. An agreement was made with the Tlaxcalans to have ritual battles called xochiyaoyotl. The flower war is a ritual war for Aztec people taking victim back and sacrifice them to their god Xipe Totec (Tezcatlipoca).

===Life outside warfare===
Since all boys starting at age 15 were trained to become warriors, Aztec society as a whole had no standing army. Therefore, warriors would be drafted to a campaign through a Tequital (a payment of goods and labor enforced by the government). Outside of battle, many warriors were farmers and tradesmen, learning their trade from their fathers. Warriors would be married by their early twenties and would be a vital part of Aztec daily life. They would work a certain trade usually passed on through family status. Warriors would be lower class citizens, that when called upon would engage in battle. Being a warrior did, however, present a way to move up in Aztec society, as the warrior&#x27;s life was a chance to change one&#x27;s social status. If they were successful as a warrior they would be presented with gifts and recognized publicly for their accomplishments in battle; if they reached the rank of Eagle or Jaguar warrior they would be considered as nobles. Especially in the latter case, they would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself, and resembled the police force of Aztec society.

===Appearance of warriors===

Aztec culture valued appearance, and appearance defined people within society. Warriors had a very distinct appearance. Their dress would be in relation to their success and triumph on the battlefield. Gaining ranks as an Aztec warrior was based on how many enemy soldiers that warrior had captured. A warrior who had taken one captive would carry a macuahuitl, and a chimalli without any decorations. He would also be rewarded with a manta, and an orange cape with a stripe, a carmine-colored loincloth, and a scorpion-knotted designed cape. (Daily, 145). A two-captive warrior would be able to wear sandals on the battlefield. He would also have a feathered warrior suit and a cone-shaped cap. The feathered suit and the cone-shaped cap appearance are the most common within the Codex Mendoza. A four captive warrior, which would be an eagle or jaguar warrior, would wear an actual jaguar skin over his body with an open slot for the head.
These warriors would have expensive jewelry and weapons. Their hairstyle was also unique to their status. The hair would sit at the top of their head and be parted into two sections with a red cord wrapped around it. The red cord would also have an ornament of green, blue, and red feathers. The shields were made of wicker wood and leather, so very few survived.

===Fortifications===
The Aztecs didn&#x27;t normally maintain tight territorial control within their empire but nonetheless, there are examples of fortifications built by the Aztecs. Prominent examples are the strongholds at Oztuma (&quot;Oztōmān&quot; ) where the Aztecs built a garrison to keep the rebellious Chontales in line; in Quauhquechollan (modern-day Huauquechula) near Atlixco where the Aztecs built a garrison in order to always have forces close to their traditional enemies the Tlaxcalteca, Chololteca and Huexotzinca; and in Malinalco near Toluca. The latter is where Ahuitzotl built garrisons and fortifications to keep watch over the Matlatzinca, Mazahua and Otomies and to always have troops close to the enemy Tarascan state&#x27;the borders with which were also guarded and at least partly fortified on both sides.

==Organization==
The Aztec army was organized into two groups. The commoners were organized into &quot;wards&quot; (&quot;calpōlli&quot;) that were under the leadership of &quot;tiachcahuan&quot; (&quot;leaders&quot;) and &quot;calpoleque&quot; (&quot;calpulli owners&quot;). The nobles were organized into professional warrior societies. Apart from the &quot;Tlatoani&quot;, the war leaders of the Aztecs were the High General, the &quot;Tlacochcalcatl&quot; (&quot;The man from the house of darts&quot;) and the General the &quot;Tlācateccatl&quot; (&quot;Cutter of men&quot;). The Tlacochcalcatl and Tlacateccatl also had to name successors prior to any battle so that if they died they could be immediately replaced. Priests also took part in warfare, carrying the effigies of deities into battle alongside the armies. The army also had boys about the age of twelve along with them serving as porters and messengers; this was mainly for training measures. The adjacent image shows the Tlacateccatl and the Tlacochcalcatl and two other officers (probably priests) known as &quot;Huitznahuatl&quot; and &quot;Ticocyahuacatl&quot;, all dressed in their &quot;tlahuiztli&quot; suits.

Calpulli were an extremely important part of Aztec warfare. Calpulli acted as a large house for your neighbors and local community in the Aztec culture. Calpulli were controlled by certain high ranking families and helped plan out the territory functions, coordinate farming strategies and food production plans, as well as collecting taxes for the empire. Calpulli were extremely important in warfare. Family and pride were extremely important aspects of Aztec culture, so it was very important to fight for your calpulli and fly your banner with pride. Calpulli operated schools for young men to transform into warriors. Having a strong Calpulli was essential as it helped protect you from other calpulli and showed your pride.
===Training===
The formal education of the Aztecs was to train and teach young boys how to function in their society, particularly as warriors. The Aztecs had a relatively small standing army. Only the elite soldiers, part of the warrior societies (such as the Jaguar Knights), and the soldiers stationed at the few Aztec fortifications were full-time. Nevertheless, every boy was trained to become a warrior with the exception of nobles. Trades such as farming and artisan skills were not taught at the two formal schools. All boys who were between the ages of ten and twenty years old would attend one of the two schools: the Telpochcalli or the neighborhood school for commoners, and the Calmecac which was the exclusive school for nobles. At the Telpochcalli, students would learn the art of warfare, and would become warriors. At the Calmecac students would be trained to become military leaders, priests, government officials, etc.

The sons of commoners were trained in the &quot;Tēlpochcalli&quot; &quot;house of youth&quot;. Once a boy reached the age of ten, a section of hair on the back of his head was grown long to indicate that he had not yet taken captives in war. At age fifteen, the father of the boy handed the responsibility of training to the telpochcalli, who would then train the boy to become a warrior. The telpochcalli was accountable for the training of approximately 419 to 559 youths between the ages of fifteen and twenty years old. While the boys were in training, they were given basic duties, such as cleaning the house and making fires. The youth were tested to determine how fit they would be for battle by accompanying their leaders on campaigns as shield-bearers. War captains and veteran warriors had the role of training the boys how to handle their weapons. This generally included showing them how to hold a shield, how to hold a sword, how to shoot arrows from a bow and how to throw darts with an atlatl. Boys in training were only considered real men when they captured their first warrior.

Sons of the nobles were trained at the &quot;calmecac&quot; (&quot;lineage house&quot;) and received sophisticated training in warfare from the most experienced warriors in the army, as well as in general courtly subjects such as astronomy, calendrics, rhetorics, poetry and religion. The &quot;calmecac&quot; were attached to temples as a dedication to patron gods. For example, the calmecac in the main ceremonial complex of Tenochtitlan was dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl. Although there is uncertainty about the exact ages that boys entered into the calmecac, according to evidence that recorded the king&#x27;s sons entering at the age of five and sons of other nobles entering between the ages of six and thirteen, it seems that youth began their training here at a younger age than those in the telpochcalli did.

When formal training in handling weapons began at age fifteen, youth would begin to accompany the seasoned warriors on campaigns so that they could become accustomed to military life and lose the fear of battle. At age twenty, those who wanted to become warriors officially went to war. The parents of the youth sought out veteran warriors, bringing them foods and gifts with the objective of securing a warrior to be the sponsor of their child. Ideally, the sponsor would watch over the youth and teach him how to take captives. However, the degree to which the warrior looked after and helped the noble&#x27;s child depended greatly on the amount of payment received from the parents. Thus, sons of high nobility tended to succeed more often in war than those of lower nobility.
===Stratification and ranks===
Broadly, Aztec army ranks were similar to the modern Western rankings of “General” and &quot;Major”, as were the groupings of warriors into categories such as “enlisted men” or “officers”. However, while parallels can be drawn between the organization of Aztec and Western military systems, as each developed from similar functional necessities, the differences between the two are far greater than the similarities. The members of the Aztec army had loyalties to many different people and institutions, and ranking was not based solely on the position one held in a centralized military hierarchy. Thus, the classification of ranks and statuses cannot be defined in the same manner as that of the modern Western military.
The commoners composed the bulk of the army; the lowest were porters (&quot;tlamemeh&quot; ) who carried weapons and supplies, next came the youths (identified by the top knot hairstyle they wore) of the &quot;telpochcalli&quot; led by their sergeants (the &quot;tēlpochyahqueh&quot; &quot;youth leaders&quot;). Next were the commoners &quot;yaoquizqueh&quot;. And finally, there were commoners who had taken captives, the so-called &quot;tlamanih.&quot; &quot;captors&quot;.

Ranking above these came the nobles of the &quot;warrior societies&quot;. These were ranked according to the number of captives they had taken in previous battles; the number of captives determined which of the different suits of honor (called &quot;tlahuiztli&quot; ) they were allowed to wear, and allowed them certain rights like being able to wear, jewelry, alter their hairstyles, wear warpaint, carry flowers onto the battlefield, pierce, and tattoo themselves. These tlahuiztli became gradually more spectacular as the ranks progressed, allowing the most excellent warriors who had taken many captives to stand out on the battlefield. The higher ranked warriors were also called &quot;Pipiltin&quot;.

===Warrior societies===
Commoners excelling in warfare could be promoted to the noble class and could enter some of the warrior societies (at least the Eagles and Jaguars). Sons of nobles trained at the Calmecac, however, were expected to enter into one of the societies as they progressed through the ranks. Warriors could shift from one society and into another when they became sufficiently proficient; exactly how this happened is uncertain. Each society had different styles of dress and equipment as well as styles of body paint and adornments.

====Tlamanih====
The Tlamanih were commoners who had taken one captive.

====Cuextecatl====
Two captive warriors, recognizable by their red and black tlahuiztli and conical hats. This rank was introduced after the military campaign against the Huastec led by Tlahtoāni Ahuitzotl.

====Papalotl====
Papalotl (lit. butterfly) were warriors who had taken three captives; this rank wore &quot;butterfly&quot; like banners on their backs.

====Eagle and Jaguar warriors====

Aztec warriors were called a cuāuhocēlōtl . The word cuāuhocēlōtl derives from the Eagle warrior cuāuhtli and the Jaguar Warrior ocēlōtl . Those Aztec warriors who demonstrated the most bravery and who fought well became either jaguar or eagle warriors. Of all of the Aztec warriors, they were the most feared. Both the jaguar and eagle Aztec warriors wore distinguishing helmets and uniforms. The jaguars were identifiable by the jaguar skins they wore over their entire body, with only their faces showing from within the jaguar head. The eagle Aztec warriors, on the other hand, wore feathered helmets including an open beak.

====Otomies====
The Otomies (&quot;Otōntin&quot;) ) were another warrior society who took their name from the Otomi people who were renowned for their fierce fighting. In the historical sources, it is often difficult to discern whether the word &quot;otomitl&quot; &quot;Otomi&quot; refers to members of the Aztec warrior society or members of the ethnic group who also often joined the Aztec armies as mercenaries or allies. A celebrated member of this warrior sect was Tzilacatzin.

====The Shorn Ones====
The &quot;Shorn Ones&quot; (&quot;Cuachicqueh&quot; , plural. &quot;Cuachic&quot;, singular) was the most prestigious warrior society – their heads were shaved apart from a long braid over the left ear. Their bald heads and faces were painted one-half blue and another half red or yellow. They served as imperial shock troops and took on special tasks as well as battlefield assistance roles when needed. Over six captives and dozens of other heroic deeds were required for this rank. They apparently turned down captaincies in order to remain constant battlefield combatants. Recognizable by their yellow tlahuiztli, they had sworn not to take a step backward during a battle on pain of death at the hands of their comrades.

==Strategic intelligence==
Because the Aztec empire was maintained through warfare or the threat of war with other cities, the gathering of information about those cities was crucial in the process of preparing for a single battle or an extended campaign. Also of great importance was the communication of messages between the military leaders and the warriors on the field so that political initiatives and collaborative ties could be established and maintained. As such, intelligence and communication were vital components in Aztec warfare. The four establishments principally used for these tasks were merchants, formal ambassadors, messengers, and spies.

===Merchants===
Merchants, called pochteca (singular: pochtecatl), were perhaps the most valued source of intelligence to the Aztec empire. As they traveled throughout the empire and beyond to trade with groups outside the Aztec&#x27;s control, the king would often request that the pochteca return from their route with both general and specific information. General information, such as the perceived political climate of the areas traded in, could allow the king to gauge what actions might be necessary to prevent invasions and keep hostility from culminating in large-scale rebellion. As the Aztec&#x27;s empire expanded, the merchant&#x27;s role gained increasing importance. Because it became harder to obtain information about distant sites in a timely way, especially for those outside the empire, the feedback and warning received from merchants were invaluable. Often, they were the key to the Aztec army&#x27;s successful response to external hostility. If a merchant was killed while trading, this was a cause for war. The Aztecs&#x27; rapid and violent retaliation following this event is testament to the immense importance that the merchants had to the Aztec empire.

Merchants were very well respected in Aztec society. When merchants traveled south, they transported their merchandise either by canoe or by slaves, who would carry a majority of the goods on their backs. If the caravan was likely to pass through dangerous territory, Aztec warriors accompanied the travelers to provide much-needed protection from wild animals and rival cultures. In return, merchants often provided a military service to the empire by spying on the empire&#x27;s many enemies while trading in the enemy&#x27;s cities. They were able to earn their protection while further helping their empire.

===Ambassadors===
Once the Aztecs had decided to conquer a particular city (Altepetl), they sent an ambassador from Tenochtitlan to offer the city protection. They would showcase the advantages cities would gain by trading with the empire. The Aztecs, in return, asked for gold or precious stones for the Emperor. They were given 20 days to decide their request. If they refused, more ambassadors were sent to the cities. However, these ambassadors were used as up front threats. Instead of trade, these men would point out the destruction the empire could and would cause if the city were to decline their offer. They were given another 20 days. If they refused the Aztec army was sent immediately. There were no more warnings. The cities were destroyed and their people were taken as prisoners.

===Messengers===
The Aztecs used a system in which men stationed approximately apart along main roads relayed messages from the empire to armies in the field or to distant cities and vice versa. For example, the runners might be sent by the king to inform allies to mobilize if a province began to rebel. Messengers also alerted certain tributary cities of the incoming army and their food needs, carried messages between two opposing armies, and delivered news back to Tenochtitlan about the outcome of the war. While messengers were also used in other regions of Mesoamerica, it was the Aztecs who apparently developed this system to a point of having impressive communicative scope.

===Spies===
Prior to mobilization, formal spies called &quot;quimichtin&quot; (lit. Mice) were sent into the territory of the enemy to gather information that would be advantageous to the Aztecs. Specifically, they were requested to take careful note of the terrain that would be crossed, fortification used, details about the army, and their preparations. These spies also sought out those who were dissidents in the area and paid them for information. The &quot;quimichtin&quot; traveled only by night and even spoke the language and wore the style of clothing specific to the region of the enemy. Due to the extremely dangerous nature of this job (they risked a torturous death and the enslavement of their family if discovered), these spies were amply compensated for their work.

The Aztecs also used a group of trade spies, known as the &quot;naualoztomeca&quot;. The &quot;naualoztomeca&quot; were forced to disguise themselves as they traveled. They sought after rare goods and treasures. The &quot;naualoztomeca&quot; were also used for gathering information at the markets and reporting the information to the higher levels of &quot;pochteca&quot;.

==Equipment==

Aztec culture is built on making sacrifices to the gods. Therefore, the goals of warfare were about capturing the enemies, not killing them. This would allow the ability to sacrifice your enemy at a later date. Due to this part of their culture, weapons were designed to hurt the opponent, but not kill them. Weapons such as the macuahuitl, tlahuitolli, yaomime, slings such as tematlat were all designed to hurt the enemy in order to capture them, not kill them.

===Ranged weapons===
&quot;Ahtlatl:&quot; (perhaps lit. &quot;non-sling&quot;) This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Opochtli. The Aztec dart thrower (known by the Spanish as &quot;estólica&quot;) was a weapon used to hurl small darts called &quot;tlacochtli&quot; with greater force and from greater range than they could be thrown by hand. This weapon was considered by the Aztecs to be suited only for royalty and the most elite warriors in the army, and was usually depicted as being the weapon of the Gods. Murals at Teotihuacan show warriors using this effective weapon and it is characteristic of the Mesoamerican cultures of central Mexico. Warriors at the front lines of the army would carry the ahtlatl and about three to five tlacochtli, and would launch them after the waves of arrows and sling projectiles as they advanced into battle before engaging into melee combat. The &quot;ahtlatl&quot; could also throw spears as its name implies &quot;spear thrower&quot;. The atlatl is a piece of equipment which was a major advancement for hunting. The atlatl practically lengthens your arms, allowing the ability to throw a spear harder, faster, and further. The atlatl creates more than 10 times the speed of a throw, and over 100 times more impact.

&quot;Tlacochtli&quot;: The &quot;darts&quot; launched from an Atlatl, not so much darts but more like big arrows about long. Tipped with obsidian, fish bones, or copper heads.

&quot;Tlahhuītōlli&quot;: The Aztec war bow, constructed in a self bow fashion from the wood of the tepozan tree, about long and stringed with animal-sinew. Archers in the Aztec army were designated as Tequihua.

&quot;Mīcomītl&quot;: The Aztec arrow quiver, usually made out of animal hide, it could hold about twenty arrows.

&quot;Yāōmītl:&quot; War arrows with barbed obsidian, chert, flint, or bone points. Typically fletched with turkey or duck feathers.

&quot;Tēmātlatl&quot;: A sling made from maguey fiber. The Aztecs used oval shaped rocks or hand molded clay balls filled with obsidian flakes or pebbles as projectiles for this weapon. Bernal Diaz del Castillo noted that the hail of stones flung by Aztec slingers was so furious that even well armored Spanish soldiers were wounded.

&quot;Tlacalhuazcuahuitl&quot;: A blowgun consisting of a hollow reed using poisoned darts for ammunition. The darts used for this weapon were made out of sharpened wood fletched with cotton and usually doused in the neurotoxic secretions from the skin of tree frogs found in jungle areas of central Mexico. This was used primarily for hunting rather than warfare.

===Melee weapons===



&quot;Mācuahuitl:&quot; (lit. &quot;hand-wood&quot;, or &quot;wood at hand&quot;) This weapon was supposed to represent the Aztec God Tezcatlipoca. Essentially a wooden sword with sharp obsidian blades embedded into its sides (similar in appearance and build to a modern cricket bat). This was the standard armament of the elite cadres. Also known in Spanish by the Taino word &quot;macana&quot;. A blow from such a weapon was reputedly capable of decapitating a horse.

&quot;Cuahuitl&quot;: (Lit. &quot;wood&quot;) A baton made out of hardwood (more than likely oak), reminiscent of the agave plant&#x27;s leaves in its shape.

&quot;Tepoztōpīlli:&quot; Wooden spear with a broad head edged with sharp obsidian blades.

&quot;Quauholōlli:&quot; A mace-like weapon, the handle was made out of wood topped with a wooden, rock, or copper ball or sphere.

&quot;Tlāximaltepōztli:&quot; This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Tepoztecatl. Basically an axe, comparable to a tomahawk, the head of which was made out of either stone, copper or bronze and had a two side design, one side had a sharp bladed edge while the other one a blunt protrusion.

&quot;Mācuāhuitzōctli&quot;: A club about long, with a knob on each of its four sides and a pointed tip.

&quot;Huitzauhqui:&quot; This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Huitzilopochtli. A wooden club, somewhat resembling a baseball bat. This weapon was used for melee attacks just as it was made, but other designs were studded with flint or obsidian cutting elements on its sides.

&quot;Tecpatl&quot;: This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Xiuhtecuhtli. A dagger with a double sided blade made out of flint or obsidian with an elaborate stone or wooden handle, overall in length. Although this would have been an effective side arm, this weapon was more commonly used in Aztec sacrifice ceremonies which may point to it being wielded mostly by Aztec warrior priests.

===Armor===
&quot;Chīmalli&quot;: Shields made with different materials such as the wooden shield &quot;cuauhchimalli&quot; or maize cane &quot;otlachimalli&quot;. There were also ornamental shields decorated with motifs made in featherwork, these were called māhuizzoh chimalli.

&quot;Ichcahuīpīlli&quot;: Quilted cotton armor which was soaked in salt water brine and then hung to dry in shade so that the salt would crystallize inside of it. One or two fingers thick, this material was resistant to obsidian swords and atlatl darts.

&quot;Ēhuatl&quot;: (lit. &quot;skin&quot;) The tunic that some noble warriors wore over their cotton armour or tlahuiztli, known in Spanish as &quot;tilma&quot;.
&quot;Tlahuiztli&quot;: The distinctively decorated suits of prestigious warriors and members of warrior societies. These suits served as a way to identify warriors according to their achievements in battle as well as rank, alliance, and social status like priesthood or nobility. Usually made to work as a single piece of clothing with an opening in the back, they covered the entire torso and most of the extremities of a warrior, and offered added protection to the wearer. Made with elements of animal hide, leather, and cotton, the tlahuiztli was most effective by enhancing the Ichcahuipilli.

&quot;Cuacalalatli&quot;: The Aztec war helmet, carved out of hardwood. Shaped to represent different animals like howler monkeys, predatory cats, birds, coyotes, or Aztec deities. These helmets protected most of a warriors head down to the jawline, the design allowed the warrior to see through the animal&#x27;s open jaw and they were decorated according to the wearer&#x27;s tlahuiztli.

&quot;Pāmitl&quot;: The identifying emblems that officers and members of prestigious warrior societies wore on their backs. Similar to the Japanese sashimono. These were frequently unique to their wearers, and were meant to identify the warrior at a distance. These banners allowed officers to coordinate the movement of their units.
==Campaigns and battles==
Once the decision of going to war was made the news were proclaimed in the plazas calling for mobilization of the army for several days or weeks in advance. When the troops were ready and any allied cities had been alerted and had given their consent to partake in the campaign the march began. Usually the first to march were the priests carrying the effigies, the next day the nobles marched led by the Tlacochcalcatl and Tlacateccatl. And on the third day the main bulk of the army set out with the Tenochca marching first followed by the warriors from the other cities in the alliance (Tepanecas and Texcocas) and lastly the allied forces from other cities, some of these subject cities would also join in gradually during the march as the army passed by their cities. Thanks to the efficient system of roads maintained throughout central Mexico the army marched an estimated average of 19–32 kilometers per day. The size of the Aztec army varied considerably from small contingents of a few thousand warriors to large armies with tens to hundreds of thousands of warriors. In the war against Coixtlahuacan the Aztec army numbered 200,000 warriors and 100,000 porters. In 1506, an Aztec army numbering 400,000 men conquered Tututepec, a Mixtec kingdom.

===Combat===
Battles (sometimes called in Nahuatl by the metaphorical diphrasism &quot;ātl tlachinolli&quot; – literally &quot;water fire&quot;) usually started at dawn but sometimes during the middle of the day – smoke signals were used to show that a battle was beginning and to coordinate attacks between different divisions of the army. The signal to attack was given by the drums (Teponaztli) and the conch shell trumpet (quiquiztli) blown by the trumpeter. Usually, the battle began with projectile fire – the bulk of the army was composed of commoners often armed with bows or slings. Then the warriors advanced into melee combat and during this phase, the &quot;atlatl&quot; was used – this missile weapon was more effective over shorter distances than slings and bows, and much more lethal. The first warriors to enter into melee were the most distinguished warriors of the &quot;Cuachicque&quot; and the &quot;Otontin&quot; societies; then came the Eagles and Jaguars, and lastly the commoners and unpracticed youths. Until entering into melee order rank was maintained and the Aztecs would try to surround or outflank the enemy, but once the melee began the ranks dissolved into a fray of individual hand-to-hand fighting. Youths participating in battle for the first time would usually not be allowed to fight before the Aztec victory was ensured, after which they would try to capture prisoners from the fleeing enemy. It is said that, particularly during flower wars, Aztec warriors would try to capture rather than kill their foes, sometimes striving to cut a hamstring or otherwise incapacitate their opponents. This has been used as an argument to explain the defeat of the Aztecs by the Spanish but this argument has been rejected by many historians – since sources clearly state that Aztecs did kill their Spanish opponents whenever they had the chance, and quickly adapted their combat strategies to their new opponents. Other Aztec tactical maneuvers included feigned retreats and ambushes where small portions of Aztec forces would attack and then fall back and lure the enemy into a trap where many more warriors were hidden in the terrain. If a defending enemy retreated into their city the battle was continued there – but normally the objective was to conquer a city rather than destroy it. Once the city was conquered the main temple would be set on fire signaling far and wide, to all concerned, the Aztec victory. If enemies still refused to surrender the rest of the city could be burned as well, but this was uncommon.

===Gladiatorial combat===

Some captives were sacrificed to Tonatiuh in ritual gladiatorial combat (as was the case of the famous warrior Tlahuicole). In this rite, the victim was tethered in place to a large carved circular &quot;stone&quot; (temalacatl) and given a mock weapon. The captive, sometimes with one arm tied behind their back or purposefully injured, was supposed to die fighting against up to four or seven fully armed jaguar and eagle knights, whereupon falling he would be promptly disemboweled by a priest, but if the captive survived he was granted freedom.

== Spanish eyewitness description of Aztec warriors ==
== Death and burial ==

Death was an essential part of Aztec culture from sacrifice to burial. Warriors were especially a part of this cycle and cultural aspect. When a warrior died either from battle or sacrifice, a ceremony was involved. Captured warriors would be sacrificed to the sun god and in some cases, the warrior would do the sacrifice. If a warrior died in battle his corpse would be burned there on the battlefield rather than at his city-state. An arrow from the fallen warrior on the battlefield would be brought back, dressed in the Sun god insignia and burned, which is curious since arrows were little-used weapons in Mexica armies.

It was believed by the Aztecs that the same place for the afterlife of warriors was also the place for women who died during childbirth. Mourning for fallen warriors was a long and sacred process. The mourners would not bathe and groom themselves for eighty days, believing this allowed time for the fallen warrior&#x27;s soul to reach the Sky of the Sun. Women had a unique role in the mourning of their dead husbands. These women would carry the cloaks of their dead husbands around with them wherever they would go. They would also let down their hair and dance in lament to the sound of beating drums. Sons would also mourn for their dead fathers. They would carry around a small box which contained the jewelry and earplugs from his father. If an eagle warrior died their burial would be in the eagle warrior hall. They would be cremated and placed in the hall. In addition to their cremated bodies, they would be buried with jewelry, jaguar clays, and gold artifacts.

<text>Computer Gaming World (CGW) is an American computer game magazine that was published between 1981 and 2006. One of the few magazines of the era to survive the video game crash of 1983, it was sold to Ziff Davis in 1993. It expanded greatly through the 1990s and became one of the largest dedicated video game magazines, reaching around 500 pages by 1997.

In the early 2000s its circulation was about 300,000, only slightly behind the market leader &quot;PC Gamer&quot;. But, like most magazines of the era, the rapid move of its advertising revenue to internet properties led to a decline in revenue. In 2006, Ziff announced it would be refocused as &quot;Games for Windows&quot;, before moving it to solely online format, and then shutting down completely later the same year.

==History==
In 1979, Russell Sipe left the Southern Baptist Convention ministry. A fan of computer games, he realized in Spring, 1981 that no magazine was dedicated to computer games. Although Sipe had no publishing experience, he formed Golden Empire Publications in June and found investors. He chose the name &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (&quot;CGW&quot;) instead of alternatives such as &quot;Computer Games&quot; or &quot;Kilobaud Warrior&quot; because he hoped that the magazine would both review games and serve as a trade publication for the industry. The first issue appeared in November, about the same as rivals &quot;Electronic Games&quot; and &quot;Softline&quot; (Sipe&#x27;s religious background led to &quot;Psalm 9:1–2&quot; appearing in each issue. His successor as editor, Johnny L. Wilson, was an evangelical Christian minister).

The first issues of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; were published from Anaheim, California, and sold for $2.75 individually or $11 for a year&#x27;s subscription of six issues. These early bimonthly issues were typically 40–50 pages in length, written in a newsletter style, including submissions by game designers such as Joel Billings (SSI), Dan Bunten (Ozark Software), and Chris Crawford. Also, early covers were not always directly related to the magazine&#x27;s contents, but rather featured work by artist Tim Finkas. In January/February 1986 &quot;CGW&quot; increased its publication cycle to nine times a year.

&quot;CGW&quot; survived the video game crash of 1983, which badly hurt the market; by summer 1985 it was the only survivor of 18 color magazines covering computer games in 1983. In autumn 1987 &quot;CGW&quot; introduced a quarterly newsletter called &quot;Computer Game Forum&quot; (CGF), which was published during the off-months of &quot;CGW&quot;. The newsletter never became popular; only two issues were published before it was cancelled. Some of CGF&#x27;s content became part of &quot;CGW&quot;, which became a monthly.

The magazine went through significant expansion starting in 1991, with page counts reaching 196 pages by its 100th issue, in November 1992. During that same year, Johnny Wilson (who started as a contributor in 1983), became editor-in-chief, although Sipe remained as publisher. In 1993, Sipe sold the magazine to Ziff Davis—by then the magazine was so thick that a reader reported that the December issue&#x27;s bulk slowed a thief who had stolen a shopping bag containing it—but continued on as publisher until 1995. The magazine kept growing through the 1990s, with the December 1997 issue weighing in at 500 pages. In January 1999, Wilson left the magazine and George Jones became editor-in-chief, at a time when print magazines were struggling with the growing popularity of the Internet. Jones had been the editor-in-chief of CNET Gamecenter, and had before that been a staffer at &quot;CGW&quot; between 1994 and 1996. He was replaced by Jeff Green in the summer of 2001.

On August 2, 2006, Ziff Davis and Microsoft jointly announced that &quot;CGW&quot; would be replaced with &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;. The new magazine replaced &quot;CGW&quot; as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Games for Windows initiative. In their press release, Ziff Davis indicated that much of &quot;CGW&#x27;s&quot; core content and the entire staff will be transferred to the new magazine. Because of these announcements, Ziff Davis&#x27; actions appeared more on the order of a rebranding of &quot;CGW&quot;, rather than an actual cancellation. The final &quot;CGW&quot;-labeled issue was November 2006, for a total of 268 published editions.

On April 8, 2008, 1UP Network announced the print edition of &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot; had ceased, and that all content would be moved online.

Simultaneously with the release of the final &quot;CGW&quot; issue, Ziff Davis announced the availability of the CGW Archive, which features complete copies of the first 100 issues of &quot;CGW&quot;, as well as the two CGF issues, for a total of 7438 pages covering 11 years of gaming. The archive was created by Stephane Racle, of the Computer Gaming World Museum, and is available in PDF format. Every issue was processed through optical character recognition, which enabled the creation of a 3+ million word master index. Although Ziff Davis has taken its CGW Archive site offline, the magazines can be downloaded from the Computer Gaming World Museum.

==Circulation==
According to MDS, &quot;CGW&quot; had a circulation slightly above 300,000 as of 2006.

==Awards and acclaim==
Bruce F. Webster reviewed the first issue of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 48. Webster commented that &quot;I strongly recommend this magazine to computer gamers, and just one reason alone will (in my opinion) suffice: You can now start getting from just one publication the information that you&#x27;ve been having to dig out of three or four or five (or six...). Get it.&quot;

&quot;Page 6&quot; reviewed &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and stated: &quot;Quite apart from being an interesting read, you will get more out of your existing games and will have a much better idea of what to buy as your next piece of software. No other computer magazine that I can think of will give you reviews of such depth.&quot;

In 1988, &quot;CGW&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Professional Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1987&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; repeatedly praised CGW, placing it as one of the premier computer game publications of its time. In 1997 the newspaper called it &quot;the leading computer game magazine&quot;, In 1999 &quot;the bible of computer game purists&quot;, and in 2005 &quot;one of the top computer game magazines&quot;.

==&quot;PC Gaming World&quot;==
Ziff Davis also published a sister magazine to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, entitled &quot;PC Gaming World&quot;, in the United Kingdom. It was the region&#x27;s third-largest computer game magazine by August 2000. In 1998, journalist Stuart Campbell described &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; as a publication with a predominantly American bent, thanks to its &quot;sober, serious, text-heavy style&quot;. He considered it to be out of step with the British game audience. Campbell later called the magazine an &quot;oddity&quot; that was &quot;clearly aimed primarily at a 40-something audience and beyond&quot;, in comparison to more youthful rivals such as &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; and &quot;PC Zone&quot;.

In July 2000, Ziff Davis sold its publishing arm in Europe to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU), including three magazines in Germany, three in France and four in the United Kingdom. &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; migrated with these publications. At the time, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that VNU saw &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; as a poor match for its business model, which left the magazine&#x27;s future uncertain. The publisher sold &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; to Computec Media a month after the purchase, citing its lack of synergy with VNU&#x27;s existing brand. This transition was set to be completed in October 2000.

According to , Computec planned to fold &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; together with its own &quot;PC Gameplay&quot; magazine, which it launched in 2000. &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; had closed by the first half of 2001; Computec moved the publication&#x27;s subscribers to &quot;PC Gameplay&quot;, which nevertheless struggled to grow its base. The company &quot;relaunched&quot; &quot;PC Gameplay&quot; as &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; in 2003, but did not release the new publication&#x27;s subscriber count through the Audit Bureau of Circulations during the first half of that year. Writing for GamesIndustry.biz, Kristan Reed noted that this decision was &quot;never a healthy sign&quot;. Computec sold its entire British game magazine branch to competitor Future Publishing in late 2003.

<text>Mary Jo Pehl (; born February 27, 1960) is an American writer, actress, and comedian. She is best known for her various roles on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

==Early life and career==
A native of Circle Pines, Minnesota, Pehl is one of three children born to Gerald Anthony Pehl, who served as Mayor of Circle Pines shortly after her birth. Although she grew up envisioning a career in nursing, by the late 1980s, her focus had entirely shifted to entertainment. 

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
Pehl was one of the writers on &quot;MST3K&quot;. From 1992 to 1996, Pehl played the role of Magic Voice, a female voice who would announce incoming commercials at the beginning of the show. In 1996, she began playing the role of Pearl Forrester, the mother of Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulieu), initially as a guest character and then as a recurring character on the departure of TV&#x27;s Frank (played by Frank Conniff). When Beaulieu left at the end of the seventh season, she took over as the head &quot;mad&quot; on the series. She would retain that role to the show&#x27;s end in the tenth season. Pehl also played a number of other small roles on the series, such as &quot;Jan in the Pan&quot;, a woman&#x27;s head that had been removed from a body (inspired by the film &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;), and &quot;White Trash Party Girl&quot; from &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;. In the Bonus Features of the DVD release of &quot;The Leech Woman&quot;, as part of the larger, special (tin container) release of the 25th Anniversary Edition (12/2013), Pehl is featured in an ongoing series, Life After MST3K.

==Work after &quot;MST3K&quot;==
Since the ending of the series, Pehl has had comedy segments on National Public Radio.

In 2007, she returned to MST3K-style riffing on bad movies, joining former castmate Mike Nelson&#x27;s RiffTrax for the film &quot;Glitter&quot;, and Bill Corbett for &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie, as well as becoming a cast member on Joel Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, making her one of a select few MST3K alumni to be involved with both Mike and Joel&#x27;s successor projects. After an extended stay in New York City, she moved to Austin, Texas, with her husband Ronald DeGroot in 2007, and has performed with the Violet Crown Radio Players.

She has since starred in the science fiction computer game &quot;&quot; as both Captain Beth Ingram of the Starship Bridgebuilder and the voice of the computer Westwick Main.

Pehl appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast on May 13, 2016.

===&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; and &quot;Rifftrax&quot;===
On October 30, 2007, Joel Hodgson announced he was starting a new show with the same &quot;riffing on bad movies&quot; premise as &quot;MST3K&quot; called &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, together with former &quot;MST3K&quot; cast and crew members Pehl, Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, and Frank Conniff.

She continued to tour with Cinematic Titanic starting from November 2012 until the show&#x27;s indefinite hiatus in December 2013.

In June 2015, Pehl teamed up with Bridget Jones Nelson to regularly riff shorts for RiffTrax, and participated in the RiffTrax Live MST3K reunion show that was broadcast live in theaters throughout the United States and Canada on June 28, 2016.

=== &quot;The Mary Jo Pehl Show&quot; ===
In August 2021, Pehl launched a monthly livestream show, &quot;The Mary Jo Pehl Show&quot;, on her own Twitch channel. The comedy-variety show has featured guest appearances by numerous &quot;MST3K&quot; alumni such as Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Jonah Ray, Bridget Jones Nelson, Rebecca Hanson, and Beez McKeever. Additionally, Pehl regularly hosts &quot;Movie Jo Night&quot; watch parties on the channel featuring her watching mostly made-for-tv movies such as &quot;Where Have All The People Gone?&quot; and &quot;Satan&#x27;s Triangle&quot;.

===Literary work===

Pehl wrote her first book in 2004 &quot;I Lived with My Parents and Other Tales of Terror&quot; published by Plan 9 Publishing.

Pehl contributed quotes to &quot;Girls Against Girls&quot; by author Bonnie Burton.

In 2011, Pehl released the book &quot;Employee of The Month And Other Big Deals.&quot;

In May 2022, Pehl released her memoir &quot;Dumb Dumb Dumb: My Mother&#x27;s Book Reviews&quot;, which celebrates the relationship she shared with her mother.

<text>Caltha palustris, known as marsh-marigold and kingcup, is a small to medium sized perennial herbaceous plant of the buttercup family, native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It flowers between April and August, dependent on altitude and latitude, but occasional flowers may occur at other times.

== Description ==
&quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is a high, hairless, fleshy, perennial, herbaceous plant that dies down in autumn and overwinters with buds near the surface of the marshy soil. The plants have many, thick strongly branching roots. Its flowering stems are hollow, erect or more or less decumbent. The alternate true leaves are in a rosette, each of which consist of a petiole that is about four times as long as the leaf blade, which is between long and wide. The leaf possesses a heart-shaped foot, a blunt tip, and a scalloped to toothed, sometime almost entire margin particularly towards the tip. In their youth the leaves are protected by a membranous sheath, that may be up to long in fully grown plants.

=== Inflorescence ===
The common marsh-marigold mostly has several flowering stems of up to long, carrying mostly several seated leaflike stipules, although lower ones may be on a short petiole; and between four and six (but occasionally as few as one or as many as 25) flowers. The flowers are approximately but range between in diameter. There are four to nine (mostly five) petal-like, brightly colored (yolk yellow, white or magenta), inverted egg-shaped sepals, each about but ranging from long, and about , ranging from wide; they have a blunt or sometimes acute tip. Real petals and nectaries are lacking. Between 50 and 120 stamens with flattened yellow filaments and yellow tricolpate or sometimes pantoporate pollen encircle 5–25 free, flattened, linear-oblong, yellow to green carpels, with a two-lobed, obliquely positioned stigma, and each with many seedbuds. This later develops into a seated, funnel-shaped fruit (a so-called follicle) of long and wide, that opens with one suture at the side of the axis and contains 7–20 ovoid, brown to black seeds of about .

== Taxonomy ==

=== Taxonomic history ===
The oldest description that is generally acknowledged in the botanical literature dates from 1700 under the name &quot;Populago&quot; by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in part 1 of his Institutiones rei herbariae. He distinguished between &quot;P. flore major&quot;, &quot;P. flore minor&quot; and &quot;P. flore plena&quot;, and already says all of these are synonymous to &quot;Caltha palustris&quot;, without mentioning any previous author. As a plant name published before 1 May 1753, &quot;Populago&quot; is invalid. And so is the first description as &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his Genera Plantarum of 1737. But Linnaeus re-describes the species under the same name in Species Plantarum of 1 May 1753, thus providing the correct name.

=== Etymology ===

The generic name &quot;Caltha&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;goblet&quot;, and is said to refer to the shape of the flower. The species epithet &quot;palustris&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the marsh&quot; and indicates its common habitat.

In the UK, &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is known by a variety of vernacular names, varying by geographical region. These include in addition to the most common two, marsh marigold and kingcup, also brave bassinets, crazy Beth, horse blob, Molly-blob, May blob, mare blob, boots, water boots, meadow-bright, bullflower, meadow buttercup, water buttercup, soldier&#x27;s buttons, meadow cowslip, water cowslip, publican&#x27;s cloak, crowfoot, water dragon, drunkards, water goggles, meadow gowan, water gowan, yellow gowan, goldes, golds, goldings, gools, cow lily, marybuds, and publicans-and-sinners. The common name &quot;marigold&quot; refers to its use in medieval churches at Easter as a tribute to the Virgin Mary, as in &quot;Mary gold&quot;. In North America &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is sometimes known as cowslip. However, cowslip more often refers to &quot;Primula veris&quot;, the original plant to go by that name. Both are herbaceous plants with yellow flowers, but &quot;Primula veris&quot; is much smaller.

=== Subdivision, synonymy and culture varieties ===

&quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is a very variable species. Since most character states occur in almost any combination, this provides little basis for subdivisions. The following varieties are nevertheless widely recognised. They are listed with their respective synonyms. If an epithet based on the same type specimen is used at different levels, only the use at the highest taxonomic rank is listed, so as &quot;C. himalensis&quot; is already listed, &quot;C. palustris&quot; var. &quot;himalensis&quot; is not.

The 2006–2007 edition of the Royal Horticultural Society &quot;Plant Finder&quot;, a British publication which lists over 70,000 plants available in nurseries in the United Kingdom, lists in addition to these varieties the following cultivars: Single flowered: &quot;Marilyn&quot;, &quot;Trotter&#x27;s form&quot;, &quot;Yellow Giant&quot;.
Double flowered: &quot;Flore Pleno&quot; (RHS&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit), &quot;Multiplex&quot;, &quot;Plena&quot;, &quot;Semiplena&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The species is native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It can be found in much of the northeastern United States.

== Ecology ==

The marsh-marigold grows in places with oxygen-rich water near the surface of the soil. It likes richer soils, but dislikes application of fertilizer and avoids high concentrations of phosphate and ammonium, and is also shy of brackish water. It is often associated with seepage that is rich in iron, because iron ions react with phosphate, thus making it unavailable for plants. The resulting insoluble mineral appears as &quot;rusty&quot; flocs on the water soil and the surface of the stems of marsh plants. Around the edge of lakes and rivers it grows between reeds, and it can be found in black alder coppices and other regularly flooded and always moist forests. When it is present it often visually dominates when it is in bloom. It also used to be common on wet meadows, but due to agricultural rationalization it is now limited to ditches.

It is a component of purple moor grass and rush pastures – a type of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the UK. It occurs on poorly drained neutral and acidic soils of the lowlands and upland fringe.

In western Europe, the marsh-marigold moth &quot;Micropterix calthella&quot; bites open the anthers of the marsh-marigold and other plants to eat the pollen. The caterpillars that are present in summer and autumn also feed on marsh-marigold, although these are sometimes found on mosses too. Another visitor of &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; in western Europe is the leaf beetle &quot;Prasocuris phellandrii&quot;, which is black with four orange stripes and around ½ cm and eats the sepals. Its larvae inhabit the hollow stems of members of the parsley family. In the USA (Illinois) two species of leaf beetle can be found on Caltha: &quot;Plateumaris nitida&quot; and &quot;Hydrothassa vittata&quot;. The maggots of some &quot;Phytomyza&quot; species (Agromyzidae) are miners in &quot;Caltha&quot; leaves.

=== Pollination ===
The flowers produce both nectar and copious amounts of pollen which attract many insect visitors. They may be most commonly pollinated by hoverflies (Syrphidae). In Canada, beetles (Cantharidae, Nitidulidae, Coccinellidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae), thrips (Thripidae), bugs (Miridae), butterflies (Pieridae), sawflies (Tenthredinidae), bees (Apidae, Halictidae, Andrenidae), ants (Formicidae) and flies (Sepsidae, Sciomyzidae, Ephydridae, Syrphidae, Anthomyiidae, Tachinidae and Muscidae) have been observed to visit the leaves or flowers, many of which were found carrying &quot;Caltha&quot; pollen.
In addition to other forms of pollination, this plant is adapted to rain-pollination.

&quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is infertile when self-pollinated. Rather high fertility in crosses between sibling plants suggest that this phenomenon is genetically regulated by several genes. This regulation mechanism also occurs in &quot;Ranunculus&quot; and as far as known only in these two genera.

=== Seed dispersal ===
In &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; up to two hundred seeds may be produced by each flower. When the follicles open, they form a &quot;splash cup&quot;. When a raindrop hits one at the right angle, the walls are shaped such that the seeds are expelled. The seeds also have some spongy tissue that makes them float on water, until they wash up in a location that may be suitable for this species to grow.

=== Diseases ===
The marsh-marigold is affected by the rust species &quot;Puccinia calthea&quot; and &quot;P. calthicola&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
&quot;Caltha&quot; contains several active substances of which the most important from a toxicological point of view is protoanemonin. Larger quantities of the plant may cause convulsions, burning of the throat, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dizziness and fainting. Contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the juices can cause blistering or inflammation, and gastric illness if ingested. Younger parts seem to contain less toxics and heating breaks these substances down. Small amounts of &quot;Caltha&quot; in hay do not cause problems when fed to husbandry, but larger quantities lead to gastric illness.

Additionally, plants that live in raw water may carry toxic organisms which can be neutralized by cooking.

== Uses ==
Early spring greens and buds of &quot;Caltha palustris&quot; are edible when cooked (but are poisonous when raw). Young leaves or buds should be submerged a few times in fresh boiling water until barely tender, cut into bite-sized pieces, lightly salted, and served with melted butter and vinegar. Very young flowerbuds have been prepared like capers and used as a spice.

The common marsh marigold is planted as an ornamental throughout temperate regions in the world, and sometimes recommended for low maintenance wildlife gardens. The double-flowered cultivar &#x27;Flore Pleno&#x27; has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Culture ==

&quot;Caltha palustris&quot; is a plant commonly mentioned in literature, including Shakespeare:
:&quot;Winking Marybuds begin&quot;
:&quot;To open their golden eyes&quot; (&quot;Cymbeline&quot;, ii. 3).

It also appears in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Shirley&quot;:
:&quot;They both halted on the green brow of the Common: they looked down on the deep valley robed in May raiment; on varied meads, some pearled with daisies, and some golden with king-cups: to-day all this young verdure smiled clear in sunlight; transparent emerald and amber gleams played over it &quot;

and in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poem &#x27;Overlooking the River Stour&#x27;:
:&quot;Closed were the kingcups; and the mead/Dripped in monotonous green,/Though the day&#x27;s morning sheen/Had shown it golden and honeybee&#x27;d&quot;.

&quot;Kingcup Cottage&quot; by Racey Helps is a children&#x27;s book which features the plant.

<text>Duarte Lobo (c. 1565 – 24 September 1646; Latinized as &quot;Eduardus Lupus&quot;) was a Portuguese composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. He was one of the most famous Portuguese composers of the time, together with Filipe de Magalhães, Manuel Cardoso, composers who all began their academic studies as students of Manuel Mendes. Along with John IV, King of Portugal, they represent the &quot;golden age&quot; of Portuguese polyphony.

==Life==
Details of his life are sparse. He was born in Alcáçovas, in Alentejo, southern Portugal. He is known to have been a choir boy at Évora where he subsequently studied with Manuel Mendes. His first position was as &quot;mestre de capela&quot; of the cathedral of Évora sometime before 1589, he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Hospital Real, Lisbon. By 1591 he was appointed as &quot;mestre de capela&quot; at the cathedral in Lisbon, a position he held till 1639. This was the most prestigious musical appointment in the country.

He also served as director of the Seminary of São Bartolomeu, and was also a professor of music at the &#x27;Colégio do Claustro da Sé&#x27; (College at the Holy See Cloisters) in Lisbon, where he taught Manuel Machado.

While chronologically his life overlapped with the beginning of the Baroque music era, he was a rather conservative composer who followed the techniques of the Renaissance masters of the previous generation. Palestrina&#x27;s polyphonic style played a crucial role in his compositions throughout his life.

<text>Galactorrhea (also spelled galactorrhoea) ( + ) or lactorrhea ( + ) is the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast, unassociated with childbirth or nursing.

Galactorrhea is reported to occur in 5–32% of females. Much of the difference in reported incidence can be attributed to different definitions of galactorrhea. Although frequently benign, it may be caused by serious underlying conditions and should be properly investigated. Galactorrhea also occurs in males, newborn infants and adolescents of both sexes.

==Causes==
Galactorrhea can take place as a result of dysregulation of certain hormones. Hormonal causes most frequently associated with galactorrhea are hyperprolactinemia and thyroid conditions with elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). No obvious cause is found in about 50% of cases.

Lactation requires the presence of prolactin, and the evaluation of galactorrhea includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods (methyldopa, opioids, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and for behavioral causes (stress, breast, and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for gestation, pituitary adenomas (with overproduction of prolactin or compression of the pituitary stalk), and hypothyroidism. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and infertility, which may be a diagnostic clue. Galactorrhea may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills.

Galactorrhea is also a side effect associated with the use of the second-generation H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (Tagamet). Galactorrhea can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, risperidone is the most notorious for causing this complication. Case reports suggest proton-pump inhibitors have been shown to cause galactorrhea.

==Neonatal milk==

Neonatal milk or witch&#x27;s milk is milk secreted from the breasts of approximately 5% of newborn infants. It is considered a normal variation and no treatment or testing is necessary. In folklore, witch&#x27;s milk was believed to be a source of nourishment for witches&#x27; familiar spirits.

<text>The Tharu people are an ethnic group indigenous to the Terai in southern Nepal and northern India. They speak Tharu languages. They are recognized as an official nationality by the Government of Nepal. In the Indian Terai, they live foremost in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Government of India recognizes the Tharu people as a scheduled Indian tribe.

== Etymology ==
The word (&quot;thāru&quot;) is thought to be derived from &quot;sthavir&quot; meaning follower of Theravada Buddhism. The Tharu people in the central Nepali Terai see themselves as the original people of the land and descendants of Gautama Buddha. Rana Tharu people of western Nepal connect the name to the Thar Desert and understand themselves as descendants of Rajputs who migrated to the forests in the 16th century.
Possible is also that the name is derived from the classical Tibetan words &quot;mtha&#x27;-ru&#x27;i brgyud&quot;, meaning the &#x27;country at the border&#x27;, which the Tibetan scholar Taranatha used in the 16th century in his book on the history of Buddhism.

== Distribution ==

In 2009, the majority of Tharu people were estimated to live in Nepal. There are several endogamous subgroups of Tharu that are scattered over most of the Terai:
*Rana Tharu people in the Kailali and Kanchanpur Districts of the far western Nepali Terai; also in India, in Udham Singh Nagar district, Uttarakhand and Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh. As of 2020, Rana Tharus are no longer considered a subgroup of Tharu people but a separate ethnicity of their own by the Government of Nepal.
*Kathariya Tharu mostly in Kailali District and in Lakhimpur Kheri, Pilibhit, Bahraich districts of India;
*Sonha Tharu in Bardia, Kailali and Kanchanpur;
*Dangaura Tharu in the western Terai: Dang-Deukhuri, Banke, Bardia, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Surkhet, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu Districts;
*Chitwan Tharu in central Terai: Makwanpur, Chitwan and Nawalparasi Districts;
*Kochila Tharu in eastern Terai: Morang, Sunsari, Saptari, Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari and Udayapur districts;
*Danuwar in eastern Terai: Sindhuli, Udayapur, Saptari and Morang Districts;
*Lampucchwa Tharu in Morang and Sunsari District. 
Smaller numbers of Tharu people reside in the adjacent Indian districts Champaran in Bihar, Gorakhpur, Basti and Gonda districts in Uttar Pradesh, and Khatima in Uttarakhand.

As of 2011, the Tharu population in Nepal was censused at 1,737,470 people, or 6.6% of the total population. The percentage of Tharu people by province was as follows:
* Sudurpashchim Province (17.3%)
* Lumbini Province (15.3%)
* Madhesh Province (5.3%)
* Koshi Province (4.1%)
* Gandaki Province (1.7%)
* Bagmati Province (1.6%)
* Karnali Province (0.4%)
The percentage of Tharu people was higher than national average (6.6%) in the following districts:
* Bardiya District (53.3%)
* Kailali District (41.9%)
* Dang District (29.7%)
* Kanchanpur District (25.8%)
* Parasi (18.4%)
* Banke District (15.8%)
* Kapilvastu District (12.3%)
* Sunsari District (12.1%)
* Nawalpur District (11.8%)
* Saptari District (11.5%)
* Chitwan District (11.0%)
* Bara District (10.5%)
* Rupandehi District (9.7%)
* Parsa District (7.6%)
* Udayapur District (7.6%)

==History==
According to Alberuni, Tharu people have been living in the eastern Terai since at least the 10th century.
The Rana Tharus in western Nepal claim to be of Rajput origin and to have migrated from the Thar Desert in Rajasthan to Nepal&#x27;s Far Western Terai region after the defeat of Maharana Pratap against a Mughal emperor in the 16th century. Some scholars refute this claim. Another claim posits that the Tharu people are descendants of the Shakya dynasty, who propagated Mahayana Buddhism in Nepal from the late 1st century BC to the early 1st century AD.

===13th to 20th centuries===
The Tabaqat-i Nasiri chronicle of the Islamic world contains records of an expedition by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji into Kamrup region between Gauda and Tibet in 1205 AD and refers to the resident people as Kunch, today&#x27;s Koch people, Mej/Meg today&#x27;s Mech people and Tiharu as having mongoloid appearances. These people impressed the Turkic peoples who had similar features as them, like slanting eyes, snub noses, high cheek bones, yellow complexion of the Mongols and who spoke a different language than in the rest of the subcontinent.

Following the unification of Nepal in the late 18th century, members of the ruling families received land grants in the Terai and were entitled to collect revenue from those who cultivated the land. The Tharu people became bonded labourers in a system also known as Kamaiya. In 1854, Jung Bahadur Rana enforced the so-called &quot;Muluki Ain&quot;, a General Code, in which both Hindu and non-Hindu castes were classified based on their habits of food and drink. Tharu people were categorized as &quot;Paani Chalne Masinya Matwali&quot;, i.e., touchable enslavable alcohol drinking group, together with several other ethnic minorities. In the late 1950s, the World Health Organization supported the Nepalese government in eradicating malaria in the forests of the central Terai. Following the malaria eradication program using DDT in the 1960s, a large and heterogeneous non-Tharu population from the Nepali hills, Bhutan, Sikkim and India settled in the region.
In the western Terai, many Tharu families lost the land, which they used to cultivate, to these immigrants and were forced to work as Kamaiya.
In Chitwan, after the eradication of malaria, the U.S. government joined forces with the Nepali government in a project to build a new road, schools and health clinics, and distribute land to migrants from the hills. They invited Tharu people to take land but many Tharus preferred staying &quot;voluntarily landless&quot;, as they worried that taking land would make them vulnerable to exploitation from Nepali governmental tax collectors and to attacks from wild animals. They preferred to stay as tenants for large Tharu landlords, who were often relatives.

When the first protected areas were established in Chitwan, Tharu communities were forced to relocate from their traditional lands. They were denied any right to own land and thus forced into a situation of landlessness and poverty. When the Chitwan National Park was designated, Nepalese soldiers destroyed the villages located inside the national park, burned down houses, and beat the people who tried to plough their fields. Some threatened Tharu people at gun point to leave.

===1990 to present===
After the overthrow of the Panchayat system in Nepal in 1990, the Tharu ethnic association &quot;Tharu Kalyankari Sabha&quot; joined the umbrella organisation of ethnic groups, a predecessor of the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities.

In July 2000, the Government of Nepal abolished the practice of bonded labour prevalent under the Kamaiya system and declared loan papers illegal. Kamaiya families were thus enfranchised from debts supposedly incurred, but were also rendered homeless and jobless. Bonded labour shifted to children who work in other households for food for themselves and their families, but rarely with access to school education.

During the Nepalese Civil War, Tharu people experienced an intense period of violence, were recruited by and coerced to help the Maoists, especially in western Nepal; several Tharu leaders were assassinated and infrastructure of the Tharu organisation Backward Society Education destroyed.
After the Comprehensive Peace Accord was signed in 2006, Tharu organisations postulated an autonomous Tharu state within a federal Nepal, emphasising equality of opportunity and equal distribution of land and resources.
In 2009, Tharu people across the Nepal Terai protested against the government&#x27;s attempt to categorise them as Madheshi people.

==Genetics==
Genetic studies on Y-DNA of Tharu people from two villages in Chitwan district and one in Morang district revealed a high presence of Haplogroup O-M117 (33.3%) followed by Haplogroup H (25.7%), Haplogroup J2a-M410(xM68, M47, M67, M158) (9.9%), Haplogroup R1a (8.8%), Haplogroup R2a-M124 (4.7%), Haplogroup J2b2-M12/M102/M241(xM99) (4.1%), Haplogroup D-M174 (3.5%), Haplogroup L-M20 (2.3%), Haplogroup O-M95 (2.3%), Haplogroup E-M35 (1.8%), Haplogroup O-M134(xM117) (1.2%), Haplogroup Q-M242 (1.2%), Haplogroup C1b1a1-M356 (0.6%), and Haplogroup K-M9(xM70, M20, M214, M74) (0.6%). A genetic study on mtDNA of several Tharus in Nepal showed that the total of South Asian mtDNA haplogroups ranges from 31.6% to 67.5% in the Tharu while the total of East Asian mtDNA haplogroups ranges from 32.5% to 68.4% depending on the Tharu group studied.
A genetic survey of Tharus from Nepal, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh showed that they have both a South Asian and an East Asian human genetic origin.

=== Resistance to malaria ===
The Tharu are famous for their ability to survive in the malarial parts of the Terai that were deadly to outsiders.
Contemporary medical research comparing Tharu with other ethnic groups living nearby found an incidence of malaria nearly seven times lower among Tharu. The researchers believed such a large difference pointed to genetic factors rather than behavioural or dietary differences. This was confirmed by follow-up investigation finding genes for thalassemia in nearly all Tharu studied.
Tharu people have limited, not complete, immunity to malaria. Many Tharus, particularly babies, died from malaria.

==Culture==

The Tharu people comprise several groups who speak different dialects and differ in traditional dress, customs, rituals and social organization.
They consider themselves as a people of the forest. In Chitwan, they have lived in the forests for hundreds of years practising a short fallow shifting cultivation. They plant rice, wheat, mustard, maize and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses; hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes.

The Rana Tharus never went abroad for employment, a life that kept them isolated in their own localities. They developed a unique culture free from the influence of adjacent India, or from the ethnic groups in Nepal&#x27;s mountains. The most striking aspects of their environment are the decorated rice containers, colorfully painted verandahs and outer walls of their homes using only available materials like clay, mud, cow dung and grass. Much of the rich design is rooted in devotional activities and passed on from one generation to the next, occasionally introducing contemporary elements such as a bus or an airplane.

===Language===

Tharu communities in different parts of Nepal and India do not share the same language. Several speak various endemic Tharu languages. In western Nepal and adjacent parts of India, Tharus speak variants of Hindi, Urdu and Awadhi. In and near central Nepal, they speak a variant of Bhojpuri. In eastern Nepal, they speak a variant of Maithili. More standard versions of these dialects are widely spoken by non-Tharu neighbors in the same areas so that there are no important linguistic barriers between Tharus and their neighbors. However, there are linguistic barriers between these dialects standing in the way of communication between Tharus from different regions.

=== Art ===

Ashtimki painting is a type of painting drawn on the day of Ashtimki festival celebrated by the Tharus in the western region of Nepal using home-made colors made from red clay (red), bean leaves (green) and burnt wild grass (black). The painting depicts the story of evolution. The main components of the painting are Krishna, a Neolamarckia cadamba tree, a boat, fish, crabs, tortoise, monkeys and other animals, the ten-headed demon Ravana, Pandava, Draupadi, a sun and a moon.
Mokha art is a typical style of painting the outer walls and verandas of homes in colourful forms in eastern Nepal. The artists, mostly women, make a mixture of clay and jute or mixture of clay, rice bran and cow dung, depending upon the district, and layers of the mixture are applied to the walls depicting floral and geometric patterns including birds and animals among many other motifs. When the design dries, they apply a layer of white clay to it and use natural colours to give them a facelift.

Denhari is a traditional earthen vessel used to store food grains. It is made by using loamy clay, paddy straw and rice husk and has a round, rectangular or conical shapes. It is mostly made by females and mostly used to store paddy, wheat, rice, maize, lentils and mustard seeds. The vessel is also an integral part of religious festival and cultural activities.

Sikki grass crafts are various handicrafts made from a special kind of grass known as sikki or moonj grass. Sikki baskets known as Dhakiya, Mauni or Daliya depending upon the place are baskets made from sikki or moonj grass plays an important role in everyday household activities of the Tharu community. They are also used in every rituals of Tharu community from the birth to death.

===Religion===
The spiritual beliefs and moral values of the Tharu people are closely linked to the natural environment. The pantheon of their gods comprises a large number of deities that live in the forest. They are asked for support before entering the forest.
Tharus have been influenced by Hinduism for several centuries. However, since the 1990s, some Tharu groups in the Nepal Terai converted to Buddhism in the wake of ethnic movements for social inclusion and against the religious hierarchy imposed by the Hindu State. In recent years a smaller number of Tharu people have converted to Christianity particularly after the rise of democracy in 1990.

===Marriage system===
Traditionally, Rana Tharus practice arranged marriages, which parents often arrange already during the couple&#x27;s childhood. The wedding ceremony is held when the bride and groom reach marriable age. The ceremony lasts several days, involving all the relatives of the two families. 
Among the Rana Tharus in Bardiya District, it is also custom to arrange marriage of a daughter in exchange for getting a bride for a son or vice versa. Parents give particular attention to the working capacity of the groom and bride, rather than the economic situation of the in-law family. Polygamous marriages are also customary among Tharu people, with rich land holders marrying between two and five women.

===Household structure===
In the western Terai, Rana Tharu traditionally live in &quot;Badaghar&quot; called longhouses with big families of up to 31 members from four generations and between one and eight married couples. The household members pool their labour force, contribute their income, share the expenditure and use one kitchen. The eldest male person in charge of &quot;Badaghar&quot; households and associated land holdings is called &quot;Mukhiya&quot;. He assigns tasks to family members, is responsible for the family&#x27;s social activities and has to report income and expenditures annually to the family. When families were forced to resettle, some of these &quot;Badaghar&quot; households broke up into smaller units of up to six households.

===Social structure===
Tharu people in Rajapur, Nepal are either landholders, cultivate land on a sharecropping basis or are landless agricultural labourers.

=== Festivals ===

Tharu people celebrate Maghe Sankranti on the first day of the Nepali month of Magh, usually around the middle of January. Depending on the location they call this day Magh, Maghi, Tila Sankranti, Kichhra and Khichdi.
In the western region of Nepal, they celebrate Ashtimki on the day of Krishna Janmashtami. On this day, people of Tharu communities draw a special artwork known as Ashtimki Chitra made on the wall of the living room of the house of the village elder. The art in painting is thought to be related to the creation of the universe.
In the eastern Terai, Tharu people celebrate Jur Sital on the first day of the year in the month of Vaisakha by sprinkling water on each other. The elders put water on the forehead and head of the young ones with blessing, while the young people put water on the feet of the elders to pay respect. Compatriots sprinkle water on each other&#x27;s body.
Tharu women of central and eastern Nepal celebrate Jitiya, which is one of the most important Tharu festivals. They fast or keep “&quot;vrata&quot;” for the welfare of their children.
Eastern Tharus celebrate Sama Chakeva in the month of Kartik to honour the relationship between brothers and sisters. The sisters make clay statuettes of &quot;Shama, Chakeva, Sathbhainya, Chugala, cymbalist, drummer, dancer, Brindavan,&quot; a wild fowl, a bumblebee and a dog among others.Atwari is a sacred festival observed by western Tharus predominantly in the western Terai of Nepal in which they venerate Bhima and offer prayers to the Surya, aspiring to embody Bhima&#x27;s strength in their traditions.

===Folk dance===
Sakhiya dance is a traditional Tharu dance performed during the Dashain and Tihar festivals by the unmarried young girls and boys. Lathi Nach, also known as Tharu stick dance, is mainly performed during the Dashain festival.

=== Cuisine ===
Tharus have a diverse food culture. Their cuisine varies depending on the region they inhabit. Ghonghi is a fresh water snail dish eaten by sucking the snail from its shell. It is served with rice and this combination, for indigenous people in Terai&quot;,&quot; had been a staple food for ages. Dhikri is a popular western Tharu dish which is prepared by making a dough with warm water and rice flour and is eaten with spicy chutney. Bagiya is similar to &quot;dhikri&quot; but is popular among eastern Tharus and consists of an external covering of rice flour and an inner content of sweet substances such like chaku, vegetables and other fried items.

<text>John Lewis Selfridge (February 17, 1927 – October 31, 2010), was an American mathematician who contributed to the fields of analytic number theory, computational number theory, and combinatorics.

==Education==
Selfridge received his Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of California, Los Angeles under the supervision of Theodore Motzkin.

==Career==
Selfridge served on the faculties of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Northern Illinois University (NIU) from 1971 to 1991 (retirement), chairing the NIU Department of Mathematical Sciences 1972–1976 and 1986–1990.
He was executive editor of &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot; from 1978 to 1986, overseeing the computerization of its operations. He was a founder of the Number Theory Foundation, which has named its Selfridge prize in his honour.

==Research==
In 1962, he proved that 78,557 is a Sierpinski number; he showed that, when &quot;k&quot; = 78,557, all numbers of the form &quot;k&quot;2&quot;n&quot; + 1 have a factor in the covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}. Five years later, he and Sierpiński conjectured that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpinski number, and thus the answer to the Sierpinski problem. A distributed computing project, Seventeen or Bust, is devoted to finding a computational proof of this statement.

In 1964, Selfridge and Alexander Hurwitz proved that the 14th Fermat number formula_1 was composite.

However, their proof did not provide a factor. It was not until 2010 that the first factor of the 14th Fermat number was found.

In 1975 John Brillhart, Derrick Henry Lehmer, and Selfridge developed a method of proving the primality of p given only partial factorizations of &quot;p&quot; − 1 and &quot;p&quot; + 1.

Together with Samuel Wagstaff they also all participated in the Cunningham project.

Together with Paul Erdős, Selfridge solved a 150-year-old problem, proving that the product of consecutive numbers is never a power. It took them many years to find the proof, and John made extensive use of computers, but the final version of the proof requires only a modest amount of computation, namely evaluating an easily computed function f(n) for 30,000 consecutive values of &quot;n&quot;. Selfridge suffered from writer&#x27;s block and thanked &quot;R. B. Eggleton for reorganizing and writing the paper in its final form&quot;.

Selfridge also developed the Selfridge–Conway discrete procedure for creating an envy-free cake-cutting among three people. Selfridge developed this in 1960, and John Conway independently discovered it in 1993. Neither of them ever published the result, but Richard Guy told many people Selfridge&#x27;s solution in the 1960s, and it was eventually attributed to the two of them in a number of books and articles.

===Selfridge&#x27;s conjecture about Fermat numbers===
Selfridge made the following conjecture about the Fermat numbers &quot;Fn&quot; = 22&quot;n&quot; + 1 . Let &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) be the number of distinct prime factors of &quot;Fn&quot; . As to 2024, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is known only up to &quot;n&quot; = 11, and it is monotonic. Selfridge conjectured that contrary to appearances, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; monotonic. In support of his conjecture he showed a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for its truth is the existence of another Fermat &quot;prime&quot; beyond the five known (3, 5, 17, 257, 65537).

===Selfridge&#x27;s conjecture about primality testing===
This conjecture is also called the PSW conjecture, after Selfridge, Carl Pomerance, and Samuel Wagstaff.

Let &quot;p&quot; be an odd number, with &quot;p&quot; ≡ ± 2 (mod 5). Selfridge conjectured that if

* 2&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;) and at the same time
* &quot;f&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1 ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;),
where &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the &quot;k&quot;th Fibonacci number, then &quot;p&quot; is a prime number, and he offered $500 for an example disproving this. He also offered $20 for a proof that the conjecture was true. The Number Theory Foundation will now cover this prize. An example will actually yield you $620 because Samuel Wagstaff offers $100 for an example or a proof, and Carl Pomerance offers $20 for an example and $500 for a proof. Selfridge requires that a factorization be supplied, but Pomerance does not. The related test that &quot;f&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;) for &quot;p&quot; ≡ ±1 (mod 5) is false and has e.g. a 6-digit counterexample. The smallest counterexample for +1 (mod 5) is 6601 = 7 × 23 × 41 and the smallest for −1 (mod 5) is 30889 = 17 × 23 × 79. It should be known that a heuristic by Pomerance may show this conjecture is false (and therefore, a counterexample should exist).

<doc id="995100" wikidata="Q173214" url="?curid=995100" title="Frank Williams (Formula One)">
<text>Sir Francis Owen Garbett Williams (16 April 1942 – 28 November 2021) was a British businessman, motorsport executive and racing driver. From 1977 to 2020, Williams served as co-founder, team principal and co-owner of Williams in Formula One, winning nine World Constructors&#x27; Championship titles between and .

== Early life ==
On 16 April 1942, Williams was born in South Shields, County Durham. At the time, his father served as an active Royal Air Force officer, while his mother worked as a school teacher. Williams was partly raised by his aunt and uncle in Jarrow, after the breakdown of his parents&#x27; marriage.

He subsequently spent much of his later childhood at a private boarding school, St Joseph&#x27;s College, Dumfries, Scotland. In the late 1950s, a friend gave Williams a ride in his Jaguar XK150, which immediately served to catalyse his interest in fast cars.

== Motorsports career ==
After a brief career as a driver and mechanic, Williams founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, funded by his work as a travelling grocery salesman. He ran drivers, including Piers Courage, for several years in Formula Two and Formula Three. Williams purchased a Brabham Formula One chassis, which Courage drove throughout the 1969 Formula One season, twice finishing in second place.

In 1970, Williams undertook a brief partnership with Alejandro de Tomaso. After the death of Courage at that year&#x27;s Dutch Grand Prix, Williams&#x27;s relationship with de Tomaso ended. In 1971, he raced Henri Pescarolo with a chassis purchased from March Engineering; 1972 saw the first F1 car built by the Williams works, the Politoys FX3 designed by Len Bailey. Pescarolo crashed and destroyed it at its first race.

Williams, short on cash and conducting team business from a telephone box after being disconnected for unpaid bills, looked to Marlboro and Iso Rivolta, an Italian car company, for sponsorship. Though they pledged their support, they did not come through in time. In 1976, Williams took on a partner in Canadian oil magnate Walter Wolf. Though the team continued functioning, it no longer belonged to Williams. He left in 1977, along with one of his employees, engineer Patrick Head. The two partners acquired an empty carpet warehouse in Didcot, Oxfordshire, and announced the formation of Williams Grand Prix Engineering, a new team to compete in Formula One. Frank hired Neil Oatley, a graduate at the time, to operate as a cartographer for Patrick Head&#x27;s drawings. Later, he brought in Frank Dernie formerly of Hesketh Racing who added additional knowledge with suspension geometry, aerodynamics and the ability to write his own computer programming (an extremely rare skill at the time). 

The team&#x27;s first win came when Clay Regazzoni drove the Cosworth-powered Williams FW07 to victory at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Their first Drivers&#x27; Championship and Constructors&#x27; Championship both came in 1980, with the Australian Alan Jones winning the drivers&#x27; title. Between 1981 and 1997, the team won six more drivers&#x27; championships and eight more constructors&#x27; championships. He also oversaw the team claim a total of 114 Grand Prix victories.

In May 1994, following the death of Ayrton Senna in the Williams FW16 at Imola, Williams was charged with manslaughter in Italy, but was acquitted in 1997. After Senna&#x27;s death, every chassis from the 1995 Williams FW17 until 2012 carried a tribute in the form of a small Senna logo on its front wing supports, or nearby.

In March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down from the board of Williams F1 and would be replaced by his daughter Claire Williams, although he would still remain with the team in the role of team principal. Williams ceased to have any involvement with the Williams team when it was sold in September 2020.

== Personal life and death ==
Williams met Virginia Berry in 1967. They married in 1974. They had two sons, Jonathan and Jaime, and a daughter, Claire, who would go on to become the deputy team principal of his future Formula One team Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

Williams used a wheelchair following a car accident in the South of France, on 8 March 1986, which rendered him tetraplegic. He was driving with team sponsorship manager Peter Windsor in a hired Ford Sierra from the Paul Ricard Circuit to Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport when the incident happened. Williams had been at the circuit to watch the testing of the team&#x27;s new Williams FW11, but as a keen long-distance runner, he was returning to the airport following the trials because he wished to compete in a half marathon in London the next day.

During the drive to the airport, he lost control of the hire car on a slight left-hand kink in the road, clipping a low stone wall, causing the vehicle to leave the highway. An drop between the road and a field caused the car to roll onto the driver&#x27;s side. Williams remained conscious but was immediately aware that he could not move and feared fire due to fuel spillage. After being pressed between his seat and the crushed roof, he suffered a spinal fracture between the fourth and fifth vertebra. Windsor, who had sustained only minor injuries, extracted Williams from the vehicle while waiting for the emergency services. Virginia flew with Patrick Head to the French hospital and believed that Williams was about to die. She organised his urgent repatriation to England, where doctors at Royal London Hospital performed a tracheotomy, which then allowed his lungs to be drained of fluid, almost certainly saving his life. Williams required constant care and physical dependence on others as a consequence of the accident.

Virginia wrote an autobiographical book published in 1991, &quot;A Different Kind of Life&quot;, in which she describes her experiences in the Formula One team&#x27;s formative years and her husband&#x27;s near-fatal accident. For his part, Williams decided not to read her account during her lifetime, preferring to leave the past in the past. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, and died on 7 March 2013, at the age of 66.

Williams was admitted to hospital in Surrey on 26 November 2021, and died two days later, on the morning of 28 November, at the age of 79.
== Awards and honours ==
Williams was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1987 New Year Honours, and received a knighthood in the 1999 New Year Honours &quot;For services to the Motor Sport Industry.&quot; He was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour by France, for his achievements with Renault F1&#x27;s engines. Williams received the Wheatcroft Trophy in 2008, in recognition of his significant contributions to motorsports.

In 2010, he was awarded the Helen Rollason Award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. Williams was added to the Motor Sport Hall of Fame as a member in 2011. In 2012, a new road in Didcot, Oxfordshire, was named Sir Frank Williams Avenue.

Formula One teams paid tribute to Williams by running a special livery of the Frank Williams Racing Cars logo at the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (the next race after his death), and a moment of silence was held before the start of the race. MurWalls created a -long mural bearing a -high portrait of Williams at the Silverstone Circuit ahead of the 2022 British Grand Prix. A memorial mass of thanksgiving for Williams took place at Westminster Cathedral in London on 4 July 2022, attended by more than 600 individuals. The Frank Williams Memorial Trophy for Masters Racing Legends race for 3.0-litre Formula One cars that competed between 1966 and 1985 was held in tribute to him in the Silverstone Classic at Silverstone late in August 2022.

<doc id="995108" wikidata="Q412621" url="?curid=995108" title="Methyldopa">
<text>Methyldopa, also known as α-methyl--DOPA and sold under the brand name Aldomet among others, is a medication used for high blood pressure. It is one of the preferred treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy. For other types of high blood pressure including very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms other medications are typically preferred. It can be given by mouth or injection into a vein. Onset of effects is around 5 hours and they last about a day.
Common side effects include sleepiness. More severe side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Methyldopa is in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist family of medication. It works by stimulating the brain to decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.
Methyldopa was discovered in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical uses ==
Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders:
* Hypertension (or high blood pressure)
* Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia.

== Side effects ==
Methyldopa is capable of inducing a number of adverse side effects, which range from mild to severe. Nevertheless, they are generally mild when the dose is less than 1 gram per day. Side effects may include:

* Psychological
** Depression 
** Suicidal ideation
** Nightmares
** Apathy, anhedonia, or dysphoria
** Anxiety, especially social anxiety
** Decreased alertness, awareness, and wakefulness
** Impaired attention and concentration
** Fatigue
** Malaise
** Drowsiness
** Restlessness
** Cognitive and memory impairment
** Derealization or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis
** Sexual dysfunction including impaired libido, desire, and drive
* Physiological
** Dizziness, lightheadedness, or vertigo
** Miosis or pupil constriction
** Xerostomia or dry mouth
** Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea or constipation
** Headache or migraine
** Myalgia or muscle aches, arthralgia or joint pain, or paresthesia (&quot;pins and needles&quot;)
** Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
** Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, or balance or postural instability
** Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia, as well as even tardive dyskinesia or dystonia
** Bell&#x27;s palsy or facial paralysis
** Sexual dysfunction
** Hyperprolactinemia 
*** Gynecomastia in males, amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females
** Bradycardia
** Hypotension
** Orthostatic hypotension
** Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, or liver dysfunction or damage
** Pancreatitis
** Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or deficiency in red blood cells (RBCs)
** Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression, potentially leading to thrombocytopenia, blood platelet deficiency, leukopenia, or white blood cell deficiency
** Hypersensitivity (e.g., lupus erythematosus, myocarditis, or pericarditis)
** Lichenoid reactions (e.g., skin lesions or rashes)
** Pallor

=== Withdrawal ===
Rebound hypertension via withdrawal on account of tolerance upon the abrupt discontinuation of methyldopa has been reported.

== Mechanism of action ==
The mechanism of action of methyldopa is not fully clear. It may reduce the dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous system and it indirectly affects norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis by way of inhibiting dopamine synthesis. Methyldopa acts on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which are found on the pre synaptic nerve terminal. This inhibits the release of norepinephrine from the presynaptic neuron. 

The S-enantiomer of methyldopa is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (LAAD), which converts -DOPA into dopamine. -DOPA can cross the blood–brain barrier and thus methyldopa may have similar effects. LAAD converts it into alpha-methyldopamine, a false prescursor to norepinephrine, which in turn reduces synthesis of norepinephrine in the vesicles. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) converts alpha-methyldopamine into alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which is an agonist of the presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release.

Methyldopa has been found to be a monoamine depleting agent.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Maximum decrease in blood pressure occurs 4–6 hours after oral dosage. The half-life of methyldopa is 105 minutes. Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine. 

== History ==
When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Additionally, it has yet to be associated with reducing adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, or overall all-cause mortality reduction in clinical trials. Nonetheless, one of methyldopa&#x27;s still current indications is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the fetus.

<text>Concordia University Wisconsin (CUW) is a private Lutheran university in Mequon, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the Concordia University System operated by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS).
The university is organized into six constituent schools in arts and science, business, education, health professions, nursing, and pharmacy. The university had an enrollment of about 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students in 2022. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==
In the spring of 1881, the Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota districts of the LCMS decided to open a &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Milwaukee. The resulting school was opened that September at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in downtown Milwaukee. Classes were taught in the basement of the building, with only 13 students in attendance. A year of instruction was added each year through 1890, making a total of four years. Students had to transfer to Concordia College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for their fifth and sixth years.

One year after opening, the college, known then as Concordia College, purchased approximately nearby to erect a permanent facility. The college was located between 31st and 33rd Streets and State Street and Highland Boulevard in Milwaukee until 1983. That campus is now owned and operated by the Forest County Potawatomi Community (the owners of the Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino).

In 1887, the three districts transferred ownership to the LCMS itself. The fifth and sixth year of instruction were added in 1890.

For the first 83 years, from its inception to 1964, the college featured a classical education with a pre-theology emphasis. Its main mission was to prepare young men for pastoral careers in the LCMS. Originally, graduates matriculated to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, for an additional four years of divinity studies, leading to ordination within the Lutheran Church.

Prior to the fall of 1964, the combination high school and junior college operated as a male-only institution. Even after women students were accepted in the junior college program for the first time that fall, the high school and the pre-seminary program continued to restrict admissions to men.

===Growth===
Under the direction of President Wilbert Rosin, the college requested four-year institution status from the LCMS for its programs, and in 1978 the request was approved. R. John Buuck became president in 1979. In 1982, the former campus of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Mequon, Wisconsin, was purchased and now has become the permanent home of CUW. In 1996, the original Milwaukee campus was turned over to the Native American Educational System of Wisconsin, which teaches tribal youth about their culture and language as the Indian Community School of Milwaukee.

As construction on the modern campus continued throughout the 1980s, the college petitioned its board of regents for full university status on August 27, 1989, and the request was approved for the fall 1990 term, making it the first among the ten Concordia University System campuses to achieve that standing. During his 17-year tenure, Buuck led the university to unprecedented growth. With the introduction of programs such as business, nursing, adult education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc., the university grew rapidly to become the largest Lutheran college and university in North America in 1996.
CUW doubled in total enrollment from 3,719 in 1995–96 to 7,485 students in 2010–11. Adult education programs were also expanded, thereby topping the list of the largest such programs in higher education for the Lutheran Church. CUW&#x27;s enrollment makes it the largest Lutheran university in the United States.

Since 2000, CUW has added several new buildings. In the summer of 2011, construction of a School of Pharmacy building was completed. The School of Pharmacy program was launched in the fall of 2010 and is a four-year professional pharmacy program designed to prepare students for a variety of careers within the pharmacy profession. By adding a School of Pharmacy, CUW has become one of three schools in the state of Wisconsin to offer a Pharm.D. degree. The building includes many amenities: clinical practice labs to develop patient care skills, state-of-the-art educational technologies, faculty research space, lecture halls, and faculty offices.

On July 1, 2013, Concordia University Ann Arbor (CUAA) merged with Concordia University Wisconsin. This merger was due to a lack of financial strength and cash flow at the Ann Arbor Campus. CUW became the administration for both campuses, with Ann Arbor considered a satellite campus to the Mequon campus.

Since the two campuses merged, enrollment at the Ann Arbor campus has nearly doubled: in 2012, it enrolled 667 students and in 2022 it enrolled 1,203 students. However, enrollment on the Wisconsin campus has significantly decreased over the same time period: in 2012, it enrolled 7,751 students and in 2022 it enrolled 4,988 students. In early 2024, university president Erik Ankerberg notified employees that the institution would need to cut some staff and sell property and equipment for the university to remain financially viable. The university has had budget shortfalls from 2017 to 2021.

=== Presidents ===
The following people have served as president of CUW:
* Carl Huth (Director), 1881–1882
* Emil Hamann (Temporary President), 1882–1885
* Christoph H. Loeber, 1885–1893
* Max J.F. Albrecht, 1893–1921
* G. Christian Barth, 1921–1934
* Leroy C. Rincker, 1936–1953
* Walter W. Stuenkel, 1953–1976
* Wilbert Rosin, 1977–1979
* R. John Buuck, 1979–1996
* Patrick T. Ferry, 1997–2021
* William R. Cario (Interim President), 2021–2023
* Erik P. Ankerberg, 2023–present
Of those presidents, all were ordained ministers in the LCMS excluding Carl Huth, William Cario, and Erik Ankerberg. Barth, Stuenkel, Rosin, Buuck, Ferry, and Ankerberg held doctorate degrees.

=== Concerns of wokeism and suspension of Gregory Schulz ===
One of Concordia&#x27;s tenured professors, Gregory Schulz, published an article criticizing the school for its use of terms such as &quot;diversity&quot;, &quot;equity&quot;, and &quot;inclusion&quot; in its search for a new president, among multiple other issues on campus which he collectively named &quot;Woke dysphoria&quot;. On February 18, 2022, he was indefinitely suspended by Interim President William Cario, banned from campus, and locked out of school accounts for demonstrating &quot;conduct unbecoming a Christian&quot;, among other accusations from the school administration.

Letters defending Schulz were sent to the university by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and the Academic Freedom Alliance. The suspension gained media coverage in various forms, as well as a petition which amassed nearly 6000 supporters.

Schulz&#x27;s article, suspension, and subsequent events sparked widespread theological concern about the university (and the entire Concordia University System) among conservative Lutherans. The president of the LCMS, Matthew Harrison, made plans to conduct an in-person visitation on March 23–25, 2022. The university welcomed Harrison&#x27;s visitation team, who gathered information from administration, faculty, staff, and students.

On May 9, 2022, a letter from Harrison to the Board of Regents called out issues such as breaches of bylaws, encroachment of secularism and Critical Race Theory, and general disregard for ecclesiastical authority. The letter also proposed various reforms for the university&#x27;s presidential search process as well as for the university at large as a confessional Lutheran institution.

On June 12, 2022, the convention of the South Wisconsin District of the LCMS resolved to limit the power of members of the Board of Regents and to ensure their upholding of synod bylaws. On June 13, the convention further resolved to &quot;identify and eliminate the promotion of social justice, or woke, ideology from the Concordia University System&quot;, e.g. &quot;critical race theory, D. I. E. (diversity, inclusion, and equity) initiatives, and other social justice activism&quot;.

On January 1, 2024, Schulz published the book &quot;Anatomy of an Implosion,&quot; which addressed the issue of &quot;Woke Marxism in Lutheran Higher Education&quot;, in addition to dealing more specifically with the related matters at Concordia.

==Campus==
The university is located at 12800 North Lake Shore Drive in Mequon, Wisconsin, a city north of Milwaukee with about 23,000 residents. The university owns a campus with over of indoor walkways, better known as &quot;tunnels&quot;. These &quot;tunnels&quot; connect all academic and residence halls on campus except for the Concordia Center for Environmental Stewardship. The university and its 10 Concordia Centers are home to more than 7,900 undergraduate and graduate, traditional, as well as non-traditional students from 46 states and 34 countries. The university offers 70 undergraduate majors, 22 master&#x27;s degree programs, and doctoral degrees in pharmacy, physical therapy, educational leadership, business administration and nursing practice. There are also a variety of accelerated evening and e-learning programs.

==Athletics==
Concordia Wisconsin teams participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III and are members of the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, shooting, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; women&#x27;s sports include acrobatics and tumbling, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, shooting, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, field hockey and wrestling.

In April 2012, CUW opened its new baseball field, Kapco Park. The field is home to both CUW&#x27;s men&#x27;s baseball and the Lakeshore Chinooks, a local minor league baseball team part-owned by Robin Yount and Bob Uecker. Kapco Park has the maximum capacity for 3,000 fans in various seating areas throughout the facility including reserved seats, fan decks, general admission and grass seating, all with beautiful views of Lake Michigan. This ballpark has a synthetic turf field, except the pitchers mound, for consistent play throughout the year. It also has a fully functioning press box, dugouts, concession area and restrooms. The park sits on the northeast corner of the campus, located on the shores of Lake Michigan.

In 2013, CUW announced the addition of acrobatics and tumbling, the university&#x27;s 24th sport with a competitive championship. CUW was expected to begin its first season of competition during the spring of 2015 with an approximate roster of 30 to 40 student-athletes. The official competition season is February–April. The Falcons became the 12th school to sponsor the emerging sport, in association with the National Collegiate Acrobatics &amp; Tumbling Association.

===Mascot===
CUW is represented by Freddy the Falcon. The school&#x27;s athletic colors are royal blue, white, and grey.

==Student life==
The university has more than 70 student organizations in various fields of interest.

CUW&#x27;s Student Government Association (SGA) oversees all student organizations on campus. It is made up of resident senators from each dormitory, commuter senators who live off-campus, organization senators who represent campus organizations, and the executive board. SGA receives its funding from the $40 Student Government Program fee that full-time students pay. SGA works with the students, faculty, campus ministry, and the administration to represent the students in all aspects of life at Concordia.

The CUW Campus Activities Board coordinates, markets, and facilitates activities for the entire campus throughout the year. These events include Homecoming, An Evening at the Lounge, Casino Night, Winterfest, and many new and traditional events.

CUW&#x27;s student policy prohibits same-sex marriage, same-sex sexual contact, and all sex outside of marriage. The LCMS regards homosexuality, homosexual thoughts, and homosexual actions as sinful. A pre-seminary student who came out as gay during his junior year was told by the university that he had no future in the Lutheran church (the LCMS does not ordain homosexual people as ministers).

<doc id="995129" wikidata="Q670049" url="?curid=995129" title="Asakusa Shrine">
<text>is a Shinto shrine in the Asakusa district of Tokyo, Japan. Also known as , it is one of the most famous Shinto shrines in the city.

The shrine honors the three men who founded the neighboring Sensō-ji. Part of a larger grouping of sacred buildings in the area, Asakusa Shrine is on the east side of the Sensō-ji, down a street marked by a large stone &quot;torii&quot;. One of the only two buildings in the area to survive World War II, it is designated an Important Cultural Property due to its long history.

==History==
An example of the &quot;gongen-zukuri&quot; style of architecture, Asakusa Shrine was commissioned by Tokugawa Iemitsu and built in 1649 during Japan&#x27;s Edo period. It was constructed to honor the three men who established and built the Sensō-ji.

Legend states that two brothers, fishermen named Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari, found a bosatsu Kannon statuette caught in a fishing-net in the Sumida River on May 17, 628. The third man, a wealthy landlord named Haji no Matsuchi (Haji no Nakatomo), heard about the discovery and approached the brothers to whom he delivered an impassioned sermon about the Buddha. The brothers were very impressed and subsequently converted to the Buddhist religion. The Kannon statue was consecrated in a small temple by the landlord and the brothers who thereafter devoted their lives to preaching the way of Buddhism. This temple is now known as the Sensō-ji. Asakusa Shrine was built in order to worship these men as deities.

The shrine and its surrounding area and buildings have also been the site of many Shinto and Buddhist festivals for centuries. The most important and famous of these festivals is Sanja Matsuri, held in late May.

Unlike many other structures in the area, including the Sensō-ji, the shrine (along with the nearby Nitenmon gate to the Sensō-ji) survived the Tokyo air raids of 1945. Because of this rich history, it was designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government in 1951.

Buildings in addition to the main shrine include a &quot;kagura-den&quot; (&quot;kagura&quot; dance hall) and the Hikan Inari Shrine.

A Nishinomiya Inari shrine was once located near the Hōzōmon gate to Sensō-ji. After the Meiji government ordered the separation of Shinto and Buddhism in 1868, the Nishinomiya shrine became part of the Asakusa Shrine and was located near the &quot;kagura-den&quot;, where it was destroyed in the 10 March 1945 firebombing.

<text>The Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) was an organization that provided a venue for unsigned artists to share their music and communicate with their audience. IUMA is widely recognized as the birthplace of online music. IUMA&#x27;s goal was to help independent artists use the Internet to distribute their music to fans while circumventing the usual distribution model of using a record company. IUMA was started by Rob Lord, Jeff Patterson and Jon Luini from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993.

IUMA originally existed as FTP and Gopher sites, before the World Wide Web was widely used. On March 9, 1994 CNN featured IUMA in their &quot;Showbiz News&quot; segment. In June 1999, IUMA was purchased by EMusic, and moved operations from Santa Cruz to Redwood City, home of the EMusic offices.
IUMA provided artists who registered with a free URL and web page. The artists could present their music over the Internet in stream, download, and internet radio format. Further, it provided an easy-to-use home page for the band and the ability to distribute their music with no bandwidth fees. Some of the original file formats used to encode the music were WAV, AIFF and MP2. MP3 was added later as that format became more popular.

In 2000, IUMA offered US$5,000 to couples who named their baby &quot;Iuma&quot;. Several families took up the offer.
IUMA flourished, hosting events such as &quot;Music-o-mania&quot;, the largest online &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; ever held. The winners were given rock star treatment, flown to San Francisco to open for Primus at the Fillmore auditorium.

IUMA was subsequently purchased in 2002 by Vitaminic, an Italian music company.

Early in 2006, the IUMA website disappeared from the Internet. The site had already been closed to new submissions since 2001, when EMusic downsized, eliminating most of the IUMA staff. Despite this setback, much of IUMA&#x27;s core group continued to work on a &quot;volunteer&quot; basis, in the hopes that IUMA could be resurrected. 

In late May 2012, Jason Scott (founder of Textfiles.com) announced that much of IUMA&#x27;s collection has been reposted via the Internet Archive. John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), managed to retrieve the surviving files before its shutdown.

<doc id="995149" wikidata="Q154519" url="?curid=995149" title="Brigitte Nielsen">
<text>Brigitte Nielsen (; born Gitte Nielsen; 15 July 1963) is a Danish actress, model, and singer. She began her career modelling for Greg Gorman and Helmut Newton. She subsequently acted in the 1985 films &quot;Red Sonja&quot; and &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, later returning to the &quot;Rocky&quot; series in &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018). Nielsen starred in the 1986 film &quot;Cobra&quot; alongside her then-husband Sylvester Stallone. She played a villain in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987) and starred as the Black Witch in the 1990s Italian film series &quot;Fantaghirò.&quot; She later built a career starring in B-movies, hosting TV shows, and appearing on reality shows.

==Early life==
Brigitte Nielsen was born Gitte Nielsen in Rødovre, Denmark. She is the daughter of Hanne, a librarian, and Svend Nielsen, an engineer, and the ex-sister-in-law of film director Nicolas Winding Refn.

==Career==

===Modelling===
Standing , at the beginning of the 1980s, Nielsen did some modelling work, and was photographed by Greg Gorman and Helmut Newton. Nielsen posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine multiple times, garnering the cover in December 1987. In the late 1980s, Marvel Comics approached Nielsen to pose for photographs dressed as the comic book character She-Hulk. Nielsen&#x27;s exploits were well-covered in the entertainment media in the 1980s, and the world press started referring to her as an &quot;Amazon&quot; because of her tall stature.

===Acting===
In 1985, Nielsen began her acting career in the fantasy film &quot;Red Sonja&quot; alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger. That same year, she married Sylvester Stallone; the couple acted in two films together (&quot;Rocky IV&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;) before divorcing in 1987.

In 1987, Nielsen played Karla Fry in the film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), alongside Eddie Murphy. In 1991, she was cast as Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk in a planned but never-produced film based on &quot;She-Hulk&quot;. She posed for photos dressed both as Jennifer Walters and her alter-ego, She-Hulk, before the film was cancelled.

Subsequently, she starred in &quot;976-Evil II&quot;, &quot;The Double 0 Kid&quot; (1992), &quot;Chained Heat II&quot; (1993), &quot;Galaxis&quot; (1995), and &quot;Snowboard Academy&quot; (1997). She starred as the villainess of the Italian TV fantasy film &quot;Fantaghirò 2&quot; and its sequels (1992–1996); her character was supposed to be killed off in the first of these films, but was then brought back due to popular demand.

In 2011, Nielsen voice acted for the Danish animated comedy film &quot;Ronal the Barbarian&quot;. In 2012, she played in the horror movie &quot;Eldorado&quot;. In 2013, she has featured in the short art film &quot;The Key&quot; alongside Ray Stevenson. In 2014, she starred in the science-fiction film &quot;Exodus&quot;, in the TV series &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, and in the action film &quot;Mercenaries&quot;. In 2018, she reprised her role of Ludmilla Drago from &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in &quot;Creed II&quot;. In 2022, she joined the cast of TV Series &quot;The Guardians of Justice&quot;, when she played Anubis Queen.

===Music and writing===
Nielsen started a music career in 1987. She released her debut album &quot;Every Body Tells a Story&quot; in that year and recorded a duet with Austrian pop star Falco, Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s penned &quot;Body Next to Body&quot; which went to No. 22 in Germany and No. 6 in Austria. She released a follow-up album, &quot;I&#x27;m the One... Nobody Else&quot;, in 1992.

Nielsen released a few songs under the pseudonym &quot;Gitta&quot; because producers wanted to see if she could succeed as a singer without her name on the cover. The first song &quot;No More Turning Back&quot; peaked at No. 54 on the British Single Charts, No. 63 on the Dutch Single Charts and even reached the Top 10 in Spain. Other tracks recorded as Gitta were 2001&#x27;s &quot;Tic Toc&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re No Lady&quot;, a collaboration with Ru Paul.

Nielsen appeared in Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; music video in 1989 and in metal band Korn&#x27;s music video for the single &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; in 2000. In 2008, German record label Edel Music re-released her 1991 album &quot;I&#x27;m the One... Nobody Else&quot; and the 1987 &quot;Every Body Tells a Story&quot; under the title &quot;Brigitte Nielsen&quot;. In 2012, she performed (as Gitte Nielsen) on the song &quot;Misery&quot; with Spleen United, from the album &quot;School of Euphoria&quot;.

In 2009, she published her first autobiography in Scandinavia titled &quot;Gitte Nielsen – Du har kun ét liv – sådan fandt jeg tilbage til mig selv&quot; (&quot;You only have one life – this is how I found myself again&quot;). The book reached the Top 5 of Denmark&#x27;s bestseller list and was released in the United Kingdom under the title &quot;You Only Get One Life&quot; in 2011.

===Television===
Nielsen has worked for Italian television, hosting shows such as: &quot;Festival&quot; (1987), the 1992 edition of the Sanremo Music Festival, &quot;Retromarsh!&quot; (1996–1997), and &quot;..la sai l&#x27;ultima?&quot; (1999). In 1997, she hosted a talk show series &quot;Gittes venner&quot; for a Danish TV network and some TV shows for RTSI, the Italian language Swiss television network. She guest starred for an episode of the German TV series &quot;Stuttgart Homicide&quot;, aired by ZDF on 28 March 2011, guest-hosted the British chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 7 December 2010. In April 2011, she attended the British variety/talent show &quot;Sing If You Can&quot;, which aired on ITV.

Nielsen appeared on the first season of the Italian production of &quot;The Mole&quot; (2004) and on the third season of the VH1 reality show &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; (2004). Nielsen also appeared with Flav on VH1&#x27;s Big in &#x27;04 Awards. In 2006, she guest-starred on Flav&#x27;s other reality show, &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;. In 2003, Nielsen appeared in the Danish &quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;. In January 2005, she was a contestant in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, along with her former mother-in-law, Jackie Stallone, coming third in the final public vote. In 2006, she appeared in another reality TV series, VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot;. In 2007, she starred in a new British mockumentary &quot;Killing Brigitte Nielsen&quot;, which aired on Sky Travel. She also appeared in the first season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which chronicled her struggle to overcome her alcoholism at the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California.

In May 2008, Nielsen revealed on German television that she would &quot;renew&quot; her body by having six plastic surgeries, which would cost €66,000 altogether. She was filmed during those surgeries by RTL and she had her own television show &quot;Aus alt mach neu – Brigitte Nielsen in der Promi-Beauty-Klinik&quot;. The same show was broadcast twice in Italy: at first under the title &quot;Celebrity Makeover: Brigitte Nielsen&quot; on SKY Italia in 2008 and secondly in 2009 on Italia 1. In 2009, Nielsen appeared as a panel speaker to a new group of addicts at the Pasadena Recovery Center, anticipating the two-year mark of her sobriety that coming July. Her appearance was aired in the third-season episode &quot;Triggers&quot;, which aired in February 2010.

In 2010, Nielsen appeared as one of the celebrity contestants of TF1 reality show &quot;La Ferme Célébrités&quot;, the French version of the TV series &quot;The Farm&quot;. She was eliminated after one week, mainly due to her lack of fluency in French and subsequent difficulties to interact with the other contestants. Nielsen was one of the celebrity contestants of 2010&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, the German version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. That same year, she also took part of &quot;Celebrity Come Dine with Me&quot; in Denmark (&quot;Til middag hos... &quot;), and in Germany (&quot;Das Perfekte Promi Dinner&quot;).

From 13 January 2012, Nielsen was one of the celebrity contestants and winner of &quot;Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!&quot;, the German version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, broadcast by RTL Television. On 28 January 2012, she won the show as the &quot;Jungle Queen&quot;. &quot;Bild&quot; revealed on 30 January 2012 that Nielsen had received the most calls from TV viewers throughout the entire show, ranking No. 1 with 30–50% of all call-ins. Nielsen was paid 150.000 Euro (approx. $163,000) for participating in the show, more than any other celebrity. In October 2012, Nielsen was featured in the Danish version of Maestro broadcast on DR1 in which celebrities competed for the chance to conduct a classical orchestra. In September 2013, she joined the cast of the German TV show &quot;Promi-Hochzeitsplanern&quot; (&quot;Celebrity Wedding planners&quot;) for Sat.1. The following year, she joined the panel of the German TV show &quot;Promi Shopping Queen&quot; for VOX.

From June 2015, she has hosted her own talk show &quot;Gitte Talks&quot; on the Danish TV Channel Kanal 4. From August 2016, she has also presented the dating show &quot;Wirt sucht Liebe&quot; (&quot;Is Looking for Love&quot;) for the German TV channel RTL II.

==Personal life==
Besides her native Danish, Nielsen is fluent in English, German and Italian, and has some understanding of French.

===Relationships and family===
Nielsen has been married five times and has four sons and one daughter. Her first husband was Kasper Winding, to whom she was married from 1983 to 1984. They have one son, Julian Winding, who was largely raised by his father and had little contact with Nielsen.

In her 2011 book, she revealed having had an affair with Arnold Schwarzenegger during the filming of &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985), after Schwarzenegger had just started a relationship with Maria Shriver. Schwarzenegger confirmed this in July 2020.

Nielsen became engaged to actor Sylvester Stallone during the production of &quot;Rocky IV.&quot; They married after the release of the film, on 15 December 1985, at the Beverly Hills, California home of producer Irwin Winkler. They eventually divorced. Their marriage and divorce were both highly publicized by the tabloid press due to their involvement on &quot;Rocky IV&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;.

From 1988 to 1990, she was in a relationship with American football player Mark Gastineau, with whom she had her second child, Killian Gastineau.

Between 1990 and 1992 she was married to director and photographer Sebastian Copeland. During a 2012 interview on the German reality TV show &quot;Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!&quot;, she confessed to having had a one-night stand with Sean Penn in Cannes back in May 1991.

Nielsen has two sons with her fourth husband Raoul Meyer, Raoul Meyer Jr. and Douglas Meyer.

In 2004 and 2005, she had a relationship with rapper Flavor Flav, whom she met during her participation in VH1 reality show &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;.

Nielsen&#x27;s husband Mattia Dessì (born 1978) lived with her in Italy as shown on &quot;Strange Love&quot;, which was filmed prior to their marriage. The couple were married in Malta on 8 July 2006. They reside in Palm Springs. In June 2018, she gave birth to her daughter Frida Dessì at the age of 54.

===Alcohol problems===
On 9 July 2007, Nielsen checked herself into the Cri-Help rehabilitation facility in North Hollywood following what some reports claim was a family intervention. Her manager, Steven Tempone, confirmed on 19 July 2007 that she had checked into a rehabilitation center and said, &quot;All I know is it&#x27;s something she did of her own free will and we&#x27;re proud of her and wish her very well... When she gets out we&#x27;ll have a big birthday party, and Coca-Cola only.&quot; As of 22 July 2007, Nielsen was out of rehabilitation to attend the &quot;Comedy Central Roast&quot; of Flavor Flav. She remarked that she felt &quot;like a new-born person ... I made a choice about a new life. It&#x27;s not been easy but it was definitely time.&quot; While the date that Nielsen checked into rehabilitation was reported, she &quot;had been in treatment for a few weeks.&quot; On 10 January 2008, VH1 began airing the reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;. Nielsen appeared on the show for alcoholism. In a January 2010, &quot;TV Guide&quot; story on her success with sobriety, &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; producer John Irwin stated, &quot;She&#x27;s sober, and she quit smoking.&quot;

===Plastic surgery===
In mid-2008, Nielsen starred in the reality show &quot;Aus alt mach neu&quot;, broadcast by German TV station RTL. The theme of the show was Nielsen&#x27;s attempt to look &quot;as young as her husband&quot; by undergoing plastic surgery. The show was aired in Italy as well, on Sky Italia during December 2008 and the following summer on Italia 1.

<text>Eleventh Hour (originally titled &quot;Dark Matter&quot;) is a four-part British television series developed by Granada Television for ITV, created by writer Stephen Gallagher.

==Plot==
The show follows the adventures of Professor Ian Hood (originally Alan Hood), played by Patrick Stewart, a Special Advisor to the government&#x27;s Joint Sciences Committee, who troubleshoots threats stemming from or targeting &quot;scientific endeavour.&quot; He is joined by Rachel Young, played by Ashley Jensen, a Special Branch operative who acts primarily as his bodyguard, as Hood has made powerful enemies through his work. The first episode was broadcast on 19 January 2006.

==Cast==
* Patrick Stewart as Professor Ian Hood
* Ashley Jensen as DS Rachel Young, Special Branch operative

==Production==
When &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; went into pre-production in April 2005, it raised considerable interest and media attention, both because of Stewart&#x27;s involvement and the budget allocated to the series by ITV, which was reportedly around £4.5 million. Gallagher, himself a two-time writer for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, made the distinction that &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; will be &quot;science-based,&quot; not science fiction or speculative fiction.

===Changing crew===
Material was added to the scripts by producer Simon Stephenson after the early episodes went into production, and creator Stephen Gallagher left his role on the series because of it. Gallagher claimed that the reason behind his departure was because his essentially &quot;science-based crime-drama&quot; had unwanted sci-fi material written into it without his consent. The subject matter and direction of the later stories appear to differ from synopses that were originally announced in April 2005.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
The complete series was released on Region 1 DVD on 26 September 2006. It was re-released on 24 May 2016 with new cover artwork, additional features and subtitles.

==Remakes==

An American remake, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Rufus Sewell as Hood (now known as Jacob Hood), aired on CBS from 2008 to 2009. American actress Marley Shelton co-starred as FBI Special Agent Rachel Young. The series aired on Thursdays at 10 pm (ET/PT). The remake was a joint venture between Jerry Bruckheimer Television, Granada Television International and Warner Bros. Television.

<doc id="995158" wikidata="Q224976" url="?curid=995158" title="List of motor yachts by length">
<text>This list of motor yachts by length, is a table of the world&#x27;s longest active superyachts, with an overall length of at least and up.

These boats are also known as &quot;megayachts&quot;, &quot;gigayachts&quot; and even &quot;terayachts&quot;, usually depending on length. It has been generally accepted by naval architects and industry executives that superyachts range from 37 m (≈120 ft) to 60 m (≈200 ft), while those over 60 m are known as megayachts and boats over 90 m (≈300 ft) have been referred to as giga-yachts.

The only legal distinction between boats above 24 m (78.75 ft) and below is that those above 24 m are viewed as a yacht and therefore must have a licensed skipper on board.

==Notes==
;Yacht seizures
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many countries announced sanctions against Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with a group of men known as Russian oligarchs, that are close friends as well as business and political allies of Putin. The sanctions have led to the seizure of their bank accounts and properties through civil forfeiture, (outside of Russia and non-participating countries), including yachts, private jets, expensive artworks, luxury homes, etc., alleging these assets to be the proceeds of crime. All these assets are to be auctioned off, for the benefit of the people of Ukraine.

<doc id="995160" wikidata="Q1290453" url="?curid=995160" title="VG Cats">
<text>VG Cats (short for &quot;Video Game Cats&quot;) is a webcomic written and drawn by Canadian cartoonist Scott Ramsoomair. Published on its own website, it follows the adventures of a pair of anthropomorphic cats, who both have an interest in video games, and often play the roles of characters in popular games that are parodied in the strip.

The &quot;VG Cats&quot; website also hosted &quot;Adventure Log&quot;, a &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; webcomic written and drawn by Ramsoomair, and &quot;Super Effective&quot;, a webcomic parody of the Pokémon game series. &quot;Adventure Log&quot; has not been updated since 2008 and &quot;Super Effective&quot; was on hiatus from 2014, recently resuming updates on September 8, 2024.

The comic series often includes video game-based humor and satire targeting the video game industry.

==History==
Ramsoomair said that he began the strip due to boredom at work; he created comics during his lunch breaks. The comic&#x27;s protagonists, Leo and Aeris, were both named after Ramsoomair&#x27;s real life pet cats, who were themselves named after characters from Final Fantasy. The first &quot;VG Cats&quot; strip was released on September 1, 2001. (His answer on the FAQ page said it was bad timing, probably in reference to the September 11 attacks that happened that same month.) Prior to taking the VGCats.com domain, the comic was hosted at www.vgcats.cjb.net. For a period, &quot;VG Cats&quot; was affiliated with BuzzComix. During April 1 (April Fools&#x27; Day), Ramsoomair replaces the regular home page with fake pages, like a &quot;Krug&quot; page in 2003 or a Myspace profile for Solid Snake in 2007.

In 2006, Ramsoomair made a strip depicting creatures from Maxis&#x27; video game Spore, and Maxis created a version of the strip replacing all the drawn characters with in-game versions, and sent him custom figurines of the creatures.

In February 2022, Ramsoomair announced the end of the webcomic in a now deleted post on Patreon. However, he later began to update the main Patreon account again on July 20, 2023, and released a new addition to comic sometime in December of the same year.

==Development==
Ramsoomair said that &quot;VGCats&quot; was &quot;basically ... along the lines of Penny Arcade.&quot; The comic originally focused on 2 gamers; Ramsoomair said by 2006 that within the preceding one to two years he began focusing upon parodies of video games instead of the two gamer format.

==Characters==

&quot;VG Cats&quot; is not a plot driven comic, though there are several characters that are staples of the comic. Ramsoomair said that all of his characters &quot;relate&quot; to him &quot;at some point.&quot;

Joystiq has defined them as &quot;adorable characters who feel most at home with violence, language, and sexual innuendo&quot;. Central characters in &quot;VG Cats&quot; include:

===Aeris===
Aeris is blue-eyed female cat with pink fur. She has a short-temper, and frequently verbally and physically abuses Leo. Her violent behavior extends to how she interacts with other characters, often assaulting other characters in the strip, as well making sarcastic quips towards them. She is also shown to have an interest in fan fiction, as well as both reading and writing yaoi. Aeris made her first appearance on September 4, 2001 in Strip #2, &quot;&quot;Pika?&quot;.

===Leo Leonardo, The Third===
Leo Leonardo, The Third is a green-eyed male cat with grey fur. Leo is shown to be unintelligent, impulsive, and have a loose grasp of reality. It is implied that Leo may have been born with Intellectual disability. He does, however, occasionally show signs of intelligence, and even takes part in similarly violent behavior as Aeris. Leo was introduced on September 4, 2001 in Strip #1, &quot;Feelin&#x27; Gassy&quot;&quot;.
===Pantsman===
The alter ego of Scott Ramsoomair, Pantsman is an incompetent superhero who concealed his identity by wearing trousers and sometimes underpants on his head. His greatest weakness is vodka cooler, which causes him to drop his trousers and transform into &quot;Peter Pantsless&quot;. He also wore a pair of jeans around his neck, to provide a two tailed cape. He was introduced in Strip 37, &quot;I Like Bunnies&quot;, to help explain the inconsistent updating of the comic.
==Animated series==

Chris Boe, a friend and associate of Ramsoomair, created an animated adaptation of &quot;VG Cats&quot;. Only the first half of the first episode, &quot;&quot;Episode 1: A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, has been produced, and was released on January 21, 2006. Boe wrote and animated the episode.

==Related comics==
Bad Mushrooms, a sprite comic created by Ramsoomair prior to the creation of &quot;VG Cats&quot;, is hosted on VGCats.com.

Adventure Log, the official &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; webcomic written and drawn by Ramsoomair. It has not been updated since 2008.

Super Effective, also done by Ramsoomair, began in April 2008 as a comic parody of the popular game series &quot;Pokémon&quot;. It is also hosted on the VGCats website. It has not been updated since 2014.

==VG Lewds==
After comic #380 in 2018, Scott created a Patreon account for furry-themed pornography based around Leo and Aeris among other video game related characters titled &quot;VG Lewds&quot;. On the same day as the aforementioned comic, Scott stated in a blog post that the site&#x27;s advertising revenue was no longer able to sustain him financially, and asked his users to help &quot;support me in this newest venture&quot;.

As of March 2022, the &quot;VG Lewds&quot; Patreon was shut down without comment, with Ramsoomair later stating that he wanted to focus on an ending for the strip.

==Merchandise==
In 2003, Ramsoomair designated CafePress as the provider of the &quot;VG Cats&quot; store; Ramsoomair soon ended the relationship with CafePress. On June 16, 2004 Ramsoomair announced that he established his store on Hyperion Press. Afterwards ZeStuff hosted the &quot;VG Cats&quot; Store. As of 2008 Shark Robot hosts the VGCats store. As of 2008, Ramsoomair is no longer affiliated with CafePress, but it still sells &quot;VG Cats&quot; merchandise on its website.

<doc id="995169" wikidata="Q1626812" url="?curid=995169" title="Landau theory">
<text>Landau theory (also known as Ginzburg–Landau theory, despite the confusing name) in physics is a theory that Lev Landau introduced in an attempt to formulate a general theory of continuous (i.e., second-order) phase transitions. It can also be adapted to systems under externally-applied fields, and used as a quantitative model for discontinuous (i.e., first-order) transitions. Although the theory has now been superseded by the renormalization group and scaling theory formulations, it remains an exceptionally broad and powerful framework for phase transitions, and the associated concept of the order parameter as a descriptor of the essential character of the transition has proven transformative.

==Mean-field formulation (no long-range correlation)==
Landau was motivated to suggest that the free energy of any system should obey two conditions:
*Be analytic in the order parameter and its gradients.
*Obey the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.

Given these two conditions, one can write down (in the vicinity of the critical temperature, &quot;T&quot;&quot;c&quot;) a phenomenological expression for the free energy as a Taylor expansion in the order parameter.

===Second-order transitions===
Consider a system that breaks some symmetry below a phase transition, which is characterized by an order parameter formula_1. This order parameter is a measure of the order before and after a phase transition; the order parameter is often zero above some critical temperature and non-zero below the critical temperature. In a simple ferromagnetic system like the Ising model, the order parameter is characterized by the net magnetization formula_2, which becomes spontaneously non-zero below a critical temperature formula_3. In Landau theory, one considers a free energy functional that is an analytic function of the order parameter. In many systems with certain symmetries, the free energy will only be a function of even powers of the order parameter, for which it can be expressed as the series expansion

:formula_4

In general, there are higher order terms present in the free energy, but it is a reasonable approximation to consider the series to fourth order in the order parameter, as long as the order parameter is small. For the system to be thermodynamically stable (that is, the system does not seek an infinite order parameter to minimize the energy), the coefficient of the highest even power of the order parameter must be positive, so formula_5. For simplicity, one can assume that formula_6, a constant, near the critical temperature. Furthermore, since formula_7 changes sign above and below the critical temperature, one can likewise expand formula_8, where it is assumed that formula_9 for the high-temperature phase while formula_10 for the low-temperature phase, for a transition to occur. With these assumptions, minimizing the free energy with respect to the order parameter requires 
:formula_11
The solution to the order parameter that satisfies this condition is either formula_12, or 
:formula_13
It is clear that this solution only exists for formula_14, otherwise formula_12 is the only solution. Indeed, formula_12 is the minimum solution for formula_17, but the solution formula_18 minimizes the free energy for formula_14, and thus is a stable phase. Furthermore, the order parameter follows the relation
:formula_20
below the critical temperature, indicating a critical exponent formula_21 for this Landau mean-theory model. 

The free-energy will vary as a function of temperature given by 
:formula_22
From the free energy, one can compute the specific heat,
:formula_23
which has a finite jump at the critical temperature of size formula_24. This finite jump is therefore not associated with a discontinuity that would occur if the system absorbed latent heat, since formula_25. It is also noteworthy that the discontinuity in the specific heat is related to the discontinuity in the &quot;second&quot; derivative of the free energy, which is characteristic of a &quot;second&quot;-order phase transition. Furthermore, the fact that the specific heat has no divergence or cusp at the critical point indicates its critical exponent for formula_26 is formula_27.

===Irreducible representations===
Landau expanded his theory to consider the restraints that it imposes on the symmetries before and after a transition of second order. They need to comply with a number of requirements:
*The distorted (or ordered) symmetry needs to be a subgroup of the higher one. 
*The order parameter that embodies the distortion needs to transform as a single irreducible representation (irrep) of the parent symmetry
*The irrep should not contain a third order invariant
*If the irrep allows for more than one fourth order invariant, the resulting symmetry minimizes a linear combination of these invariants

In the latter case more than one daughter structure should be reacheable through a continuous transition. A good example of this are the structure of MnP (space group Cmca) and the low temperature structure of NbS (space group P63mc). They are both daughters of the NiAs-structure and their distortions transform according to the same irrep of that spacegroup.

===Applied fields===
In many systems, one can consider a perturbing field formula_28 that couples linearly to the order parameter. For example, in the case of a classical dipole moment formula_29, the energy of the dipole-field system is formula_30. In the general case, one can assume an energy shift of formula_31 due to the coupling of the order parameter to the applied field formula_28, and the Landau free energy will change as a result:
:formula_33
In this case, the minimization condition is 
:formula_34
One immediate consequence of this equation and its solution is that, if the applied field is non-zero, then the magnetization is non-zero at any temperature. This implies there is no longer a spontaneous symmetry breaking that occurs at any temperature. Furthermore, some interesting thermodynamic and universal quantities can be obtained from this above condition. For example, at the critical temperature where formula_35, one can find the dependence of the order parameter on the external field: 
:formula_36
indicating a critical exponent formula_37. 

Furthermore, from the above condition, it is possible to find the zero-field susceptibility formula_38, which must satisfy 
:formula_39
:formula_40
In this case, recalling in the zero-field case that formula_41 at low temperatures, while formula_42 for temperatures above the critical temperature, the zero-field susceptibility therefore has the following temperature dependence: 
:formula_43
which is reminiscent of the Curie-Weiss law for the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in magnetic materials, and yields the mean-field critical exponent formula_44.

It is noteworthy that although the critical exponents so obtained are incorrect for many models and systems, they correctly satisfy various exponent equalities such as the Rushbrooke equality: formula_45.

===First-order transitions===
Landau theory can also be used to study first-order transitions. There are two different formulations, depending on whether or not the system is symmetric under a change in sign of the order parameter.

====I. Symmetric Case====
Here we consider the case where the system has a symmetry and the energy is invariant when the order parameter changes sign.
A first-order transition will arise if the quartic term in formula_46 is negative. To ensure that the free energy remains positive at large formula_1, one must carry the free-energy expansion to sixth-order,

:formula_48

where formula_49, and formula_50 is some temperature at which formula_51 changes sign. We denote this temperature by formula_50 and not formula_3, since it will emerge below that it is not the temperature of the first-order transition, and since there is no critical point, the notion of a &quot;critical temperature&quot; is misleading to begin with. formula_54 and formula_55 are positive coefficients.

We analyze this free energy functional as follows: (i) For formula_56, the formula_57 and formula_58 terms are concave upward for all formula_1, while the formula_60 term is concave downward. Thus for sufficiently high temperatures formula_46 is concave upward for all formula_1, and the equilibrium solution is formula_63. (ii) For formula_64, both the formula_57 and formula_60 terms are negative, so formula_63 is a local maximum, and the minimum of formula_46 is at some non-zero value formula_69, with
formula_70. (iii) For formula_71 just above formula_72, formula_63 turns into a local minimum, but the minimum at formula_74 continues to be the global minimum since it has a lower free energy. It follows that as the temperature is raised above formula_50, the global minimum cannot continuously evolve from
formula_74 to 0. Rather, at some intermediate temperature formula_77, the minima at formula_78 and formula_63 must become degenerate. For formula_80, the global minimum will jump discontinuously from formula_78 to 0.

To find formula_77, we demand that free energy be zero at formula_83 (just like the formula_84 solution), and furthermore that this point should be a local minimum. These two conditions yield two equations,
:formula_85
:formula_86
which are satisfied when formula_87. The same equations also imply that formula_88. That is,
:formula_89

From this analysis both points made above can be seen explicitly. First, the order parameter suffers a discontinuous jump from formula_90 to 0. Second, the transition temperature formula_77 is not the same as the temperature formula_50 where formula_51 vanishes. 

At temperatures below the transition temperature, formula_94, the order parameter is given by
:formula_95
which is plotted to the right. This shows the clear discontinuity associated with the order parameter as a function of the temperature. To further demonstrate that the transition is first-order, one can show that the free energy for this order parameter is continuous at the transition temperature formula_77, but its first derivative (the entropy) suffers from a discontinuity, reflecting the existence of a non-zero latent heat.

====II. Nonsymmetric Case====
Next we consider the case where the system does not have a symmetry. In this case there is no reason to keep only even powers of formula_1 in the expansion of formula_46, and a cubic term must be allowed (The linear term can always be eliminated by a shift formula_99 + constant.) We thus consider a free energy functional

:formula_100

Once again formula_49, and formula_102 are all positive. The sign of the cubic term can always be chosen to be negative as we have done by reversing the sign of formula_1 if necessary.

We analyze this free energy functional as follows: (i) For formula_64, we have a local maximum at formula_63, and since the free energy is bounded below, there must be two local minima at nonzero values formula_106 and formula_107. The cubic term ensures that formula_108 is the global minimum since it is deeper. (ii) For formula_109 just above formula_50, the minimum at formula_111 disappears, the maximum at formula_63 turns into a local minimum, but the minimum at formula_108 persists and continues to be the global minimum. As the temperature is further raised, formula_114 rises until it equals zero at some temperature formula_77. At formula_77 we get a discontinuous jump in the global minimum from formula_117 to 0. (The minima cannot coalesce for that would require the first three derivatives of formula_46 to vanish at formula_63.)

To find formula_77, we demand that free energy be zero at formula_121 (just like the formula_84 solution), and furthermore that this point should be a local minimum. These two conditions yield two equations,
:formula_123
:formula_124
which are satisfied when formula_125. The same equations also imply that formula_126. That is,
:formula_127
As in the symmetric case the order parameter suffers a discontinuous jump from formula_128 to 0. Second, the transition temperature formula_77 is not the same as the temperature formula_50 where formula_51 vanishes.

===Applications===
It was known experimentally that the liquid–gas coexistence curve and the ferromagnet magnetization curve both exhibited a scaling relation of the form formula_132, where formula_133 was mysteriously the same for both systems. This is the phenomenon of universality. It was also known that simple liquid–gas models are exactly mappable to simple magnetic models, which implied that the two systems possess the same symmetries. It then followed from Landau theory why these two apparently disparate systems should have the same critical exponents, despite having different microscopic parameters. It is now known that the phenomenon of universality arises for other reasons (see Renormalization group). In fact, Landau theory predicts the incorrect critical exponents for the Ising and liquid–gas systems.

The great virtue of Landau theory is that it makes specific predictions for what kind of non-analytic behavior one should see when the underlying free energy is analytic. Then, all the non-analyticity at the critical point, the critical exponents, are because the &quot;equilibrium value&quot; of the order parameter changes non-analytically, as a square root, whenever the free energy loses its unique minimum.

The extension of Landau theory to include fluctuations in the order parameter shows that Landau theory is only strictly valid near the critical points of ordinary systems with spatial dimensions higher than 4. This is the upper critical dimension, and it can be much higher than four in more finely tuned phase transition. In Mukhamel&#x27;s analysis of the isotropic Lifschitz point, the critical dimension is 8. This is because Landau theory is a mean field theory, and does not include long-range correlations.

This theory does not explain non-analyticity at the critical point, but when applied to superfluid and superconductor phase transition, Landau&#x27;s theory provided inspiration for another theory, the Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity.

==Including long-range correlations==
Consider the Ising model free energy above. Assume that the order parameter formula_134 and external magnetic field, formula_28, may have spatial variations. Now, the free energy of the system can be assumed to take the following modified form:

:formula_136

where formula_137 is the total &quot;spatial&quot; dimensionality. So,

:formula_138

Assume that, for a &quot;localized&quot; external magnetic perturbation formula_139, the order parameter takes the form formula_140. Then,

:formula_141

That is, the fluctuation formula_142 in the order parameter corresponds to the order-order correlation. Hence, neglecting this fluctuation (like in the earlier mean-field approach) corresponds to neglecting the order-order correlation, which diverges near the critical point.

One can also solve for formula_143, from which the scaling exponent, formula_144, for correlation length formula_145 can deduced. From these, the Ginzburg criterion for the upper critical dimension for the validity of the Ising mean-field Landau theory (the one without long-range correlation) can be calculated as:
:formula_146

In our current Ising model, mean-field Landau theory gives formula_147 and so, it (the Ising mean-field Landau theory) is valid only for spatial dimensionality greater than or equal to 4 (at the marginal values of formula_148, there are small corrections to the exponents). This modified version of mean-field Landau theory is sometimes also referred to as the Landau–Ginzburg theory of Ising phase transitions. As a clarification, there is also a Ginzburg–Landau theory specific to superconductivity phase transition, which also includes fluctuations.

<text>Waianae Range (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Waianae Mountains&quot;) is the eroded remains of an ancient shield volcano that comprises the western half of the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. Its crest, at Kaʻala, is the highest peak on Oahu at .

Like the neighboring Koolau, the Waianae Range is not a mountain range in the sense most people are familiar with, as the mountain range as a whole was created from a single volcano rather than plate tectonics.

The oldest lava dated from the volcano are about 3.9 million years old. About 3.2 million years ago, the volcano&#x27;s activity changed, the rate of eruption started to decrease and the composition of the lava erupted from the volcano changed. The volcano is thought to have last erupted about 2.5 million years ago.

When active, the Waianae volcano&#x27;s center of activity was at present-day Lualualei Valley. Intense erosion on the western flank of the mountain has destroyed much of those flanks. Thus, the mountain today is much smaller than it was when the volcano was active.

While the western part of the mountain has been destroyed by erosion, the eastern part is still in a youthful stage of erosion. This is considered somewhat strange by some geologists since the western part of the volcano is on the leeward side of the island; thus, most rain falls on the eastern side of the volcano. Given this information, more erosion would be expected on the eastern portion of the mountain. One theory to explain this erosion pattern is that a large landslide cut away the western portion of the volcano. The faults from this huge landslide weakened the rock, making the western part of the mountain much more susceptible to erosion than the eastern side.

<text>Promethazine, sold under the brand name Phenergan among others, is a first-generation antihistamine, sedative, and antiemetic used to treat allergies, insomnia, and nausea. It may also help with some symptoms associated with the common cold and may also be used for sedating people who are agitated or anxious, an effect that has led to some recreational use (especially with codeine). Promethazine is taken by mouth (oral), as a rectal suppository, or by injection into a muscle (IM).
Common side effects of promethazine include confusion and sleepiness; consumption of alcohol or other sedatives can make these symptoms worse. It is unclear if use of promethazine during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the fetus. Use of promethazine is not recommended in those less than two years old, due to potentially negative effects on breathing. Use of promethazine by injection into a vein is not recommended, due to potential skin damage. Promethazine is in the phenothiazine family of medications. It is also a strong anticholinergic, which produces its sedative effects. This also means high or toxic doses can act as a deliriant.
Promethazine was made in the 1940s by a team of scientists from Rhône-Poulenc laboratories. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1951. It is a generic medication and is available under many brand names globally. In 2022, it was the 198th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with dextromethorphan was the 260th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Promethazine has a variety of medical uses, including:

* Sedation
* In Germany, it is approved for the treatment of agitation and agitation associated with underlying psychiatric disorders with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.
* For nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia or chemotherapy. It is commonly used postoperatively as an antiemetic. The antiemetic activity increases with increased dosing; however, side effects also increase, which often limits maximal dosing.
* For moderate to severe morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum: In the UK, Promethazine is the drug of first choice. Promethazine is preferred during pregnancy because it is an older drug and there is more data regarding the use of it during pregnancy. Second-choice medications, which are used if Promethazine isn&#x27;t tolerated or the patient cannot take it, are metoclopramide or prochlorperazine.
* For allergies such as hay fever and together with other medications in anaphylaxis
* To aid with symptoms of the common cold
* Motion sickness, including space sickness
* Hemolytic disease of the newborn
* Anxiety before surgery
* Short-term insomnia

==Side effects==
Some documented side effects include:

* Tardive dyskinesia, pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonia (effects due to dopamine D2 receptor antagonism)
* Confusion in the elderly
* Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, more rarely vertigo
* Known to have effects on serotonin and dopamine receptors.
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Respiratory depression in patients under the age of two and those with severely compromised pulmonary function
* Blurred vision, xerostomia, dry nasal passages, dilated pupils, constipation, and urinary retention. (due to its anticholinergic effects)
* Chest discomfort/pressure (In children less than 2 years old)
* Akathisia

Less frequent:

* Cardiovascular side effects to include arrhythmias and hypotension
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
* Liver damage and cholestatic jaundice
* Bone marrow suppression, potentially resulting in agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia
* Depression of the thermoregulatory mechanism resulting in hypothermia/hyperthermia

Rare side effects include:

* Seizures

Because of the potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly. In many countries (including the US and UK), promethazine is contraindicated in children less than two years of age, and strongly cautioned against in children between two and six, due to problems with respiratory depression and sleep apnea.

Promethazine is listed as one of the drugs with the highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.

==Overdose==
Promethazine in overdose can produce signs and symptoms including CNS depression, hypotension, respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and sudden death. Other reactions may include hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, and extensor-plantar reflexes. Atypically and/or rarely, stimulation, convulsions, hyperexcitability, and nightmares may occur. Anticholinergic effects like dry mouth, dilated pupils, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and delirium may occur as well. Treatment of overdose is supportive and based on symptoms.

==Pharmacology==
Promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, is structurally different from the neuroleptic phenothiazines, with similar but different effects. Despite structural differences, promethazine exhibits a strikingly similar binding profile to promazine, another phenothiazine compound. Both promethazine and promazine exhibit comparable neuroleptic potency, with a neuroleptic potency of 0.5. However, dosages used therapeutically, such as for sedation or sleep disorders, have no antipsychotic effect. It acts primarily as a strong antagonist of the H1 receptor (antihistamine, &quot;K&quot;i = 1.4 nM) and a moderate mACh receptor antagonist (anticholinergic), and also has weak to moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, D2, and α1-adrenergic receptors, where it acts as an antagonist at all sites, as well. New studies have shown that promethazine acts as a strong non-competitive selective NMDA receptor antagonist, with an EC50 of 20 μM; which might promote sedation in addition with the strong antihistaminergic effects of the H1 receptor, but also as a weaker analgesic. It does not, however, affect the AMPA receptors.

Another notable use of promethazine is as a local anesthetic, by blockage of sodium channels.

==Chemistry==
Solid promethazine hydrochloride is a white to faint-yellow, practically odorless, crystalline powder. Slow oxidation may occur upon prolonged exposure to air, usually causing blue discoloration. Its hydrochloride salt is freely soluble in water and somewhat soluble in alcohol. Promethazine is a chiral compound, occurring as a mixture of enantiomers.

==History==
Promethazine was first synthesized by a group at Rhone-Poulenc (which later became part of Sanofi) led by Paul Charpentier in the 1940s. The team was seeking to improve on diphenhydramine; the same line of medical chemistry led to the creation of chlorpromazine.

===Recreational use===

The recreational drug lean, also known as purple drank among other names, often contains a combination of promethazine with codeine-containing cold medication.

=== Product liability lawsuit ===
In 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled on a product liability case involving promethazine. Diana Levine, a woman with a migraine, was administered Wyeth&#x27;s Phenergan via IV push. The drug was injected improperly, resulting in gangrene and subsequent amputation of her right forearm below the elbow. A state jury awarded her $6 million in punitive damages.

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court on grounds of federal preemption and substantive due process. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts&#x27; rulings, stating that &quot;Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration&quot; without acting in opposition to federal law. In effect, this means drug manufacturers can be held liable for injuries if warnings of potential adverse effects, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are deemed insufficient by state courts.

In September 2009, the FDA required a boxed warning be put on promethazine for injection, stating the contraindication for subcutaneous administration. The preferred administrative route is intramuscular, which reduces the risk of surrounding muscle and tissue damage.

<text>Alton Baker Park is located in Eugene, Oregon, United States, near Autzen Stadium. In June 1967, it was dedicated to Alton F. Baker Sr., the eleventh owner (60 years after it was founded) of Eugene&#x27;s &quot;The Guard&quot; newspaper (later &quot;The Register-Guard&quot;). It features duck ponds, bicycle trails, a dog park and a disc golf course, and directly touches the Ferry Street Bridge across the Willamette River.

Other amenities include the Cuthbert Amphitheater, a venue for outdoor musical and drama performances. The amphitheater is named for Fred Cuthbert, the park&#x27;s designer. PRE TRAIL1st development in Alton Baker Park

==Whilamut Natural Area==
The less developed, eastern part of Alton Baker Park is known as the Wilhamut Natural Area and links to Springfield&#x27;s Eastgate Woodlands via bicycle paths and open space. &quot;Wilhamut&quot; is a Kalapuya word that means &quot;where the river ripples and runs fast&quot;. A ceremony to rename the former East Alton Baker Park took place on September 7, 2002 and included a traditional Kalapuya naming ceremony.

==Nobel Peace Park==
In April, 2013, the Nobel Peace Laureate Project opened a one-acre parcel inside Alton Baker Park to celebrate the United States recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. The park within a park is the first Nobel Peace Park in the United States.

<text>Steller Secondary School is an alternative school located in Anchorage, Alaska. The Anchorage School District established the school in 1974 as a response to a proposal by the Committee of Alternative Secondary Education. Steller was named after Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist from Germany who traveled with Vitus Bering on an exploratory voyage to Alaska.

==History==
For the first nine years of its existence, Steller was located in the old North Star Elementary School building. After much political activity by Steller parents, the Alaska Legislature approved funds to remodel the school and add a new gym as well as a drama facility/auditorium. In 1992, the auditorium was rebuilt after a structural failure caused the roof to collapse, leaving nearly everything ruined except for the stage&#x27;s curtains. The voters of Anchorage approved a school bond in 2003 to provide funding for the addition of a new science lab and relocation and renovation of the staff lounge, offices surrounding the gymnasium, and the special education office. This construction was completed in October 2004.

==Notable alumni==
* Marty Beckerman, author, humorist, journalist, and features editor with &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine
* Mark Begich, former mayor of Anchorage, Alaska and former U.S. Senator from Alaska
* Mario Chalmers, basketball player (7-9th grades)

<doc id="995207" wikidata="Q4752735" url="?curid=995207" title="Anchorage School District">
<text>The Anchorage School District (ASD) manages all public schools within the Municipality of Anchorage in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is the 107th largest school district in the United States, serving over 45,000 students in more than 90 schools.

==Operations==
The district includes all of Anchorage municipality.

District superintendent Carol Comeau, appointed in December 2000, retired June 30, 2012. She was succeeded by Jim Browder. After eight months, Jim Browder resigned and was replaced by Ed Graff; later in 2015 Ed Graff was replaced by Deena Bishop (formerly Deena Paramo), previously the Superintendent of Matsu Valley School District. Bishop resigned at the end of the 2022 school term and was replaced by Jharrett Bryantt.

==Demographics==
In the 2018-2019 school year, the Anchorage School District enrolled approximately 46,695 students. In terms of race and ethnicity, the Anchorage School District is considered a minority-majority district, meaning the minority groups make up the majority of the district&#x27;s population. Non-white students make up roughly 58 percent of the school district&#x27;s student body.

Composition:
The district served approximately 8,600 students with special needs who were eligible for special education services in 2008-09. Also that year, the district&#x27;s English Language Learner program for students with limited English Proficiency served 5,808 students and the Gifted program assisted 3,563 students.

==Instruction==
In 2008-09, the district&#x27;s graduation rate was 70.48 percent. It has increased nearly 11 percentage points since the 2004-05 school year. The dropout rate for ASD students is 3.43 percent, a figure that has been cut nearly in half since the 2004-05 school year.

In 2009-10, ASD had 48 teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. National board certification is voluntary and involves a rigorous performance-based assessment that takes one to three years for a successful candidate to achieve. The certification complements, but does not replace a state&#x27;s teacher certificate. It is valid for 10 years and establishes the teacher as “highly qualified” and a “master” teacher in the eyes of the district and state.

In 2009-10, 99 percent of new teachers were highly qualified. The remaining 1 percent were unable to prove their HQT status and were terminated. As of May 1, 2010, the state HQT reports 95.4 percent of ASD teachers had an HQT designation in the content area they were teaching. To put this into perspective almost six years after the State adopted regulations mandating that urban District&#x27;s limit instruction in core classes to HQ teachers, ASD is still out of compliance, while HQ requirements can be via Praxis examinations.

The district also has approximately 225 certificated employees such as counselors, psychologists, speech pathologists, OT/PT, nurses and more.

ASD&#x27;s last curriculum audit was conducted in 2002.

22.5 credits are required to graduate high school in the Anchorage School District. All high schools in the Anchorage School District offer AP (Advanced Placement) classes, but only West Anchorage High School offers IB (International Baccalaureate) classes.

==Test Scores==
The district releases test scores each fall in a comprehensive report called Profile of Performance. See Expect the Best is a condensed version of that 2,000-page document: it is put forward as an annual report to the community.

In 2008-09 test scores remained relatively flat. Language arts scores declined from 81.4 to 80.4 percent and math scores declined from 73.7 to 71.4 percent since last year. These scores follow three years of steady growth.

In order to make AYP (adequate yearly progress) each school must meet up to 31 specific targets that have been established by the state in which the district is located. Proficiency on state adopted measurements, test participation, attendance, and graduation rates are used to determine AYP for each school each year. 
2008-09 school-wide results for the district&#x27;s 96 schools are as follows: 
* 96 percent met the test participating requirement.
* 85 percent met the language arts requirement.
* 89 percent met the math requirement.
* 97 percent met the attendance/graduation requirement.
Thirty-nine ASD schools met every requirement for which they were accountable. Fifteen missed AYP by just one target; 42 schools missed by two or more targets. Complete coverage, including historical statistics, of federal AYP requirements, are available on the district&#x27;s website.

In 2009, only some 27% of students in Alaska were proficient in Reading on the NAEP test. For some reason, though Anchorage&#x27;s population exceeded 250,000 NAEP did not include Anchorage in its review of Urban Districts.

==Food service==
On December 16, 2019, news was announced to all students at the schools serving Subway sandwiches for lunch that the district decided to go with more healthy and convenient options for school lunches, removing Subway sandwiches from the menu. It went into effect the second semester of the 2019-2020 school year..

<text>Thomson and Thompson ( ) are fictional characters in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. They are two detectives who provide much of the comic relief throughout the series. Hergé twice calls them &quot;brothers&quot; in the original French-language text. They are afflicted with chronic spoonerisms, are extremely clumsy, thoroughly clueless, frequently arresting the wrong person (usually someone important). In spite of this, they somehow are entrusted with delicate missions.

The detective with the flat, drooping walrus moustache is Thompson and introduces himself as &quot;Thompson, with a &#x27;P&#x27;, as in psychology&quot; (or any such word in which the &quot;P&quot; is silent), while the detective with the flared, pointed moustache is Thomson, who often introduces himself as &quot;Thomson, without a &#x27;P&#x27;, as in Venezuela.&quot;

Often, when one says something, the other adds &quot;To be precise&quot; (), but then repeats what the first said, only twisted around.

Thomson and Thompson usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks, except when abroad: during these missions they insist on wearing the stereotypical costume of the country they are visiting, hoping to blend into the local population, but instead manage to dress in folkloric attire that actually makes them stand out.

The detectives were in part based on Hergé&#x27;s father and uncle, identical twins who wore matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.

==Character history==
In &quot;Tintin in America&quot; there are characters similar to Thomson and Thompson: two policemen who collide with each other, and an incompetent detective called Mike MacAdam.

In &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, Thomson and Thompson make only a brief one-panel appearance (although they did not appear in the original version). Their first contribution to the plot of a story comes in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; (originally published in 1934), where they first appear when they come into conflict with Tintin on board a ship where he and Snowy are enjoying a holiday cruise. When this adventure was first published they were referred to as X33 and X33A (X33 et X33 bis in French). Here they show an unusually high level of cunning and efficiency, going to great lengths to rescue Tintin from the firing squad (in disguises that fool even Tintin) and saving Snowy from sacrifice. In this and two other early stories — &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and &quot;The Black Island&quot; — they spend most of their time, forced to follow official orders and faked evidence, in pursuit of Tintin himself for crimes he has not committed, the two noting in &quot;Blue Lotus&quot; that they never believed in Tintin&#x27;s guilt even though they had to obey their orders. Except for their codenames, they remained nameless in the early adventures. It was not until &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, published in 1938, that Tintin mentions their definitive names when introducing them to Professor Alembick at the airport.

In his 1941 play &quot;Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond&quot; co-written with Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé named them as &quot;Durant and Durand&quot;, although he later renamed them as &quot;Dupont and Dupond&quot;. When &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was serialised in &quot;Eagle&quot; for British readers in 1951, the characters were referred to as &quot;Thomson and Thompson&quot;; these names were later adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner in their translation of the series into English for Methuen Publishing.

While the original version of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; was published in 1932, the rewritten and redrawn version was issued in 1955, and was not published in English until 1971. This resulted in some chronological confusion for English-speaking readers of the &quot;Tintin&quot; series, which is why the text hints that Tintin already knows the pair, and is surprised at their unfriendly behaviour; however, in the original chronological sequence, this is indeed the first time they ever meet. In addition, Hergé retroactively added them to the 1946 colour version of the second &quot;Tintin&quot; story, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, in the background as Tintin embarks for what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Thomson and Thompson were originally only side characters but later became more important. In the re-drawings of the earlier books, especially &quot;The Black Island&quot;, the detectives gained their now-traditional mannerisms.

In &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, the detectives mistakenly swallow some mysterious pills used to adulterate fuel, that causes them to sprout immensely long beards and hair that change colour constantly and grow at a break-neck pace. The condition wears off by the end of this adventure, but it relapses in &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, causing problems when Captain Haddock must continuously cut their hair, repeatedly switching back to re-cut floor length hair (and mustaches and beards) which all grow back in seconds. Frustrated at this, the captain exclaims &quot;After all this, when they ask me what did I do on the rocket, I&#x27;ll reply &#x27;Me, you say? I was the barber!&#x27;&quot;

In the 19 books following &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, Thomson and Thompson appear in 17 of them, not appearing in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; or &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. In some of these books their role is minor – the duo&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; is confined to two panels; they appear briefly only at the beginning of &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; (before being tricked into closing the case in the belief that the stolen object has been returned when it was actually replaced by a fake); and are imprisoned and face execution on false charges in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;. During their other appearances, they serve as the official investigators into whatever crimes Tintin is currently investigating. Their final appearance was in &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot;.

==Inspiration and cultural impact==

The detectives were in part based on Hergé&#x27;s father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks. Another inspiration was a picture of two mustachioed, bowler-hatted, formally dressed detectives who were featured on the cover of the &quot;Le Miroir&quot; edition of 2 March 1919. They were shown escorting Emile Cottin, who had attacked Georges Clemenceau—one detective was handcuffed to the man while the other was holding both umbrellas.

They also make a brief cameo appearance in the Asterix book &quot;Asterix in Belgium&quot;.

They make an appearance in &quot;L&#x27;ombra che sfidò Sherlock Holmes&quot;, an Italian comic spin-off of &quot;Martin Mystère&quot;, edited by Sergio Bonelli Editore.

The name of the pop group the Thompson Twins was based on Thomson and Thompson.

The detectives are regular characters in the 1991–1992 television series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, as well as the 2011 motion-capture film adaptation &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;. In the film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost portray Thomson and Thompson.

==Names in other languages==
In the original French, and are stereotypically prevalent surnames (akin to &quot;Smith&quot;) and pronounced identically (). The different letters indicate their different moustache styles: D for (&quot;straight&quot;), T for (&quot;turned up&quot;). Translators of the series in some languages have tried to find names for the pair that are common, and similar or identical in pronunciation. They thus become:
* and in Afrikaans
* and ( and ) in Arabic
* and in Aragonese
* (Johnson) and (Ronson) in Bengali
* &quot;Pichot and Pitxot&quot; in Cadaquesenc (Catalan dialect in Cadaques)
* and in Cornish
* and in Czech
* and in Dutch
* &quot;Thomson&quot; and &quot;Thompson&quot; in English
* and in Esperanto
* and in German
* &quot;Schulz&quot; and &quot;Schulze&quot; in German (only in the 1990s TV Series)
* and in Hindi
* and in Latin
* and in Polish
* and in Romanian
* and in Spanish (Juventud edition only), Galician and Asturian
* and in Icelandic
* and in Serbian
* and in older Portuguese editions
* and in Scots
* and in Scottish Gaelic
* &quot;Johns&quot; and &quot;Jones&quot; or &quot;Parry-Williams&quot; and &quot;Williams-Parry&quot; in Welsh ( and Dalen editions, respectively)
* and in West Flemish (Kortrijk dialect)
* and in West Flemish (Ostend dialect)

In some languages, the French forms are more directly adapted, using local orthographic ambiguities:
* In Chinese
** and or and ( and , or and in Traditional Chinese), or
** and ( and )
* and in Greek ( and , pronounced )
* and in Japanese ( and )
* and in Latvian
* and in Persian ( and )
* and in Korean ( and )
* and in Russian ( and )

The original Dupond and Dupont are kept in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Hungarian, Turkish, Finnish, Indonesian, Italian, Basque, Catalan, the Casterman edition in Spanish, and the newer Portuguese editions.

During this trip he also fully resolved to restore his family position using his writing.

A second walking tour in 1802 lasted three months and was a tour along the Tōkaidō Post Road. On this tour, visited many places that would appear in his future work. He also encountered people of various social standing and professions. His travels coincided with extensive flooding across the nation. witnessed recent destruction and displaced peoples all along the road.

<text>Tourmakeady College (Irish: &quot;Coláiste Mhuire Tuar Mhic Éadaigh&quot;) is an Irish-speaking voluntary secondary school in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, Ireland. The school has approximately 200 students.

The school was at the centre of the Gaelic literary revival. The Coláiste Chonnacht was founded in 1905 as a summer school by Conradh na Gaeilge. The principal was Micheál Breathnach, with Máire Ní Tuathail as his assistant. The school became known as &quot;Cliabhran Conradh na Gaeilge&quot;—the &quot;cradle of the Gaelic League&quot;. Among the people who visited the school were Douglas Hyde (later to become the first President of Ireland), Patrick Pearse, Éamon de Valera, Kuno Meyer (the renowned German Gaelic scholar), Padraig Ó Domhnallain, and other Irish writers visited the school frequently. De Valera was later to marry Sinead Flanagan, who had been a teacher at the school.

Coláiste Chonnacht continued as a summer school until the 1960s; it was then taken over by the Sisters of Mercy, who ran a successful boarding school for girls. The sisters left in 1990 owing to a drop in the number of vocations, and the school was handed over to a local committee.

<doc id="995223" wikidata="Q7197981" url="?curid=995223" title="Piri Thomas">
<text>Piri Thomas (born Juan Pedro Tomas; September 30, 1928 – October 17, 2011) was an American writer and poet of Puerto Rican-Cuban descent, whose memoir &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; became a best-seller.

==Early years==
Thomas was born to a Puerto Rican mother and Cuban father. His childhood neighborhood in the Spanish Harlem section of New York City was riddled with crime and violence. According to Thomas, children were expected to be gang members at a young age, and Thomas was no exception. Thomas was also exposed to racial discrimination because of his Afro-Latino heritage. As an Afro-Latino man, Piri Thomas not only experienced racial discrimination based on his complexition within his neighborhood, but also within the ingrained colorism in his household. Thomas was born during the great depression, his family experienced its hardships, especially his father. His father felt that he needed to provide for his family and would bounce from job to job. Thomas&#x27;s father seemed to not treat him the same as his siblings due to his darker skin tone. His mother on the other hand treated Thomas and his siblings equally. As a matter of fact, it is alluded in &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;, that his mother had a soft spot for Piri. At home she would bring them much comfort. On a few occasions Thomas would get into fights and this would cause his family much grief. Thomas was involved with drugs, gang warfare and crime. He became addicted to herion. While spending seven years in prison for an attempted armed robbery, Thomas reflected on the teachings of his mother and father, and realized that a person is not born a criminal. Consequently, he decided to use his street and prison know-how to reach at-risk youth, and to help them avoid a life of crime.

==&quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;==
In 1967, Thomas received funds from the Rabinowitz Foundation to write and publish his best-selling autobiography &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;. The book describes his struggle for survival as a Puerto Rican/Cuban born and raised in the barrios of New York. The autobiography explains Thomas&#x27;s journey of figuring out his identity. It takes readers on a deep dive into his life and how he navigates the struggles he encounters from being Afro-Latino. The book challenged racism and racial thinking in the 1940s. Thomas would address the racism in his family and would claim his black heritage throughout the memoir. In addition, the book points out key narratives on democracy and racial supremacy. The book, which has been in print for 52 years, was banned in some places but also required reading, depending on the time and place. He narrated the rampant racism of the pre-Civil Rights Act of 1964. His other works include &quot;Savior, Savior Hold My Hand;&quot; &quot;Seven Long Times;&quot; and &quot;Stories from El Barrio. with el primo&quot;

One of his most known works is the chapter in &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; called &quot;Brothers Under the Skin.&quot; In this chapter, Piri Thomas brings light to an altercation between him and his brother in which they argued about their race. Piri&#x27;s brother, Jose, is adamant about being only Puerto Rican and white. While Piri is able to acknowledge that he has black ancestry and is willing to go &quot;down south&quot; to learn more about his culture. The brothers go back and forth on the topic about their race and end up physically hurting one another. Both their parents seem to deny the fact that they have Black heritage as well and Piri&#x27;s mother believes that he does not like to be &quot;un negrito&quot;.

== &quot;Savior, Savior, Hold My Hand&quot; ==
In 1972, Thomas published Savior, Savior, Hold My Hand. Thomas describes matters regarding faith, vulnerability, and seeking guidance throughout life. Thomas, delving into his own personal experiences, recounts how he chose to lead his life after being released from prison. The book follows Thomas as he converts to Christianity, helps inner-city youth, finds job employment, and how he gets married. This book serves as a plea from Thomas himself to a higher power as he has a desire to change his life.

Those who critique Savior, Savior, Hold My Hand reference how this book lacks Thomas&#x27; emotionality from his first book, Down These Mean Streets.

==Later years==
Thomas was an influential precursor to the Nuyorican Movement which included poets Pedro Pietri, Miguel Algarín, and Giannina Braschi, who wrote of life in New York City using a mix of English and Spanish. Thomas worked on a book titled &quot;A Matter of Dignity&quot; and on an educational film entitled &quot;Dialogue with Society.&quot;

Thomas traveled around the U.S., Central America and Europe, giving lectures and conducting workshops in colleges and universities. In 1968, Gordon Parks filmed a documentary titled &quot;The World of Piri Thomas&quot;. In 2003, Jonathan Meyer Robinson made a film &quot;Every Child is Born a Poet: The Life and Work of Piri Thomas&quot;, which featured a soundtrack by Kip Hanrahan.

On October 17, 2011, Thomas died from pneumonia at his home in El Cerrito, California. He was survived by his wife Suzie Dod Thomas, six children, and three stepchildren.

<text>Peter Paul Bergman (November 29, 1939 – March 9, 2012) was an American comedian and writer, best known as the founder of the Firesign Theatre. He played Lt. Bradshaw in the Nick Danger series.

==Biography==
Bergman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and graduated in 1957 from Shaker Heights High School in the Cleveland suburb.

He studied economics at Yale University, where he contributed to the campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. He taught economics as a Carnegie Fellow, and also attended the Yale School of Drama as a Eugene O&#x27;Neill Playwriting Fellow, and wrote two musicals for the Yale Dramatic Association with Austin Pendleton, where he met acting student Philip Proctor. He was also a Woodrow Wilson Scholar. After college he worked with Tom Stoppard, Derek Marlowe, Piers Paul Read, and Spike Milligan.
The Firesign Theatre was formed as a result of Bergman&#x27;s show &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; on KPFK. According to Bergman, &quot;I started July 24th, 1966 on KPFK ... I had some very interesting people around me, which those folks became the Firesign Theatre: David Ossman was connected with the station, Phil Austin was connected with the station, and Phil Proctor came out to do a show and we connected in LA and that was really the genesis of that whole happening.&quot; Bergman also coined the word &quot;love-in&quot; in 1967, and organized the first such event in April 1967 in Los Angeles. He and Proctor witnessed the 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre in San Francisco.

Stage versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;, &quot;The Further Adventures of Nick Danger&quot;, &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot;, and &quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot; are published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc.

==Death==
Bergman died on March 9, 2012, in Santa Monica, California, at age 72 from complications due to leukemia.

<doc id="995235" wikidata="Q209015" url="?curid=995235" title="1 Night in Paris">
<text>1 Night in Paris is a 2004 porn video filmed by Rick Salomon. Promoted by Kevin Blatt, it depicts Paris Hilton having sexual intercourse in May 2001 with Salomon. Not originally intended for release, it was filmed primarily with a single, stationary, tripod-mounted camera using &quot;night vision&quot;. However, a handful of scenes were filmed indoors without night vision.

==Release==
The video was released by Salomon shortly after Hilton&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Simple Life&quot; debuted, causing a media sensation. When Hilton stated publicly that she had been &quot;out of it&quot;, did not know what she was doing during the taping of the video, and did not approve its public release, Salomon sued Hilton for defamation. Hilton then countersued Salomon over the release of the tape, settling out of court in July 2005. According to reports, Hilton was awarded as much as $400,000 and planned to donate a percentage to charity.

In a 2006 interview with the British edition of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Hilton stated: &quot;I never received a dime from the video. It&#x27;s just dirty money and (Salomon) should give it all to some charity for the sexually abused or something. To be honest, I don&#x27;t even think about it any more.&quot;

The video received the AVN Awards in 2005 for &quot;Best Selling Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Renting Title of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Best Overall Marketing Campaign – Individual Project&quot;. The DVD titled &quot;1 Night in Paris&quot; is distributed by Red Light District, a production company that produces and distributes pornographic videos. The rights to the video have since been purchased by Vivid Entertainment.

The official release of the video opened with a dedication that states: &quot;In memory of 9/11/01... We will never forget.&quot;

American singer-songwriter P!nk parodied one of the scenes from the sex tape in her music video for her song &quot;Stupid Girls&quot;.

In 2021 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Hilton said the tape, which was released without her consent and caused a media sensation, was &quot;humiliating&quot; and is &quot;something that will hurt me for the rest of my life.&quot;

==Accolades==
* 2005 AVN Award - Best Overall Marketing Campaign, Individual Project
* 2005 AVN Award - Best Renting Title of the Year
* 2005 AVN Award - Best Selling Title of the Year
* 2008 F.A.M.E. Award - Favourite Celebrity Sex Tape

<text>The Sindhi languages or Sindhic include Sindhi and its dialects as well as Indo-Aryan languages closely related to it.

Lasi and Sindhi Bhil are sometimes added, but are commonly considered dialects of Sindhi proper. It is not clear if Jandavra is Sindhi or Gujarati. Though Dhatki is a Rajasthani language, it is heavily influenced by Sindhi and Kutchi. Khetrani shares grammatical features with both Sindhi and Saraiki but is not mutually intelligible with either.
