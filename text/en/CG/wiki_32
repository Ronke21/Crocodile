<text>Enchanter is an interactive fiction game written by Marc Blank and Dave Lebling and published by Infocom in 1983. The first fantasy game published by Infocom after the &quot;Zork&quot; trilogy, it was originally intended to be &quot;Zork IV&quot;. The game has a parser that understands over 700 words, making it the most advanced interactive fiction game of its time. It was Infocom&#x27;s ninth game.

The game was followed by a 1984 sequel, &quot;Sorceror&quot;.

==Plot==
Krill, a powerful evil warlock, is spreading chaos and destruction. None of the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters dare to attempt to stop him. In desperation, the player, a novice Enchanter with only a few weak spells in his spell book, is sent in hopes that Krill will either fail to detect him or dismiss him as harmless. More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly.

==Gameplay==
This game has a new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot; series and partially &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&#x27; Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through &quot;memorization&quot; before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense &quot;magic word&quot; which is treated as a verb by the game&#x27;s text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing codice_1, in exactly the same way as one might type codice_2 or codice_3.

==Notes==
In the game &quot;Zork III&quot;, a device slowly cycles through &quot;scenes&quot; from each of the Zork games as a number is displayed above it. A depiction of the sacrificial altar from the then-unreleased &quot;Enchanter&quot; appeared under the number &quot;IV&quot;. Creators Dave Lebling and Marc Blank decided during the game&#x27;s design that the magic system made it a standalone product. It became the first game of its own trilogy, usually referred to as &quot;The Enchanter Trilogy&quot;. The others in the series are 1984&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;.

Infocom rated &quot;Enchanter&quot; as &quot;Standard&quot; in difficulty.

&quot;Enchanter&quot; is the only game in the Zork universe where lurking grues, although they still exist, are not mentioned by name; the game doesn&#x27;t even know the word &quot;grue&quot;.

The game has 17 ways to die.

==Legacy==
Robin Wayne Bailey&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Enchanter&quot; is a companion rather than a novelisation.

In 1993, about ten years after the original &quot;Enchanter&quot;, a remake of the game with graphics was developed and published by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801, entitled .

Frotz, a modern open-source interpreter for Infocom games (as well as independently written interactive fiction) draws its name from a spell (&quot;cause object to glow with illumination&quot;) in &quot;Enchanter&quot; and its sequels. Another spell, Blorb (&quot;hide an object in a strongbox&quot;), provides the name for a standard wrapper for interactive fiction multimedia resources. Several other IF tools have also been named after spells from the series.

==Reception==
Released in September, 1983, Infocom sold about 50,000 copies of &quot;Enchanter&quot; by the end of 1984, and 75,000 over its lifetime or as part of the &quot;Enchanter Trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Scorpia praised the game as &quot;typically excellent&quot; and up to the standards expected of Infocom games. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Enchanter&quot; is filled with the usual Infocom doses of wit, red herrings ... twists, turns, and surprises&quot;. It stated that while beginners would enjoy it, experienced text adventure gamers &quot;may be disappointed. There didn&#x27;t seem to be a whole lot to do. I solved the game in record time, for me; it left me wanting more ... The very moniker &quot;Infocom&quot; may be raising my expectations too high&quot;. John J. Anderson wrote in &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, &quot;With Enchanter, they have scored again ... Enchanter is full of the delightful little touches we have come to expect from Infocom.&quot; &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that &quot;Enchanter&quot; had &quot;nothing strikingly original about it, but you&#x27;ll appreciate its high level of challenge and meticulously maintained continuity&quot;. It stated that &quot;some of the humor lacks, well, subtlety&quot;, citing the name Dimwit Flathead as example, and that &quot;the narrative won&#x27;t win any literary awards, either&quot;. The magazine concluded that it &quot;is an excellent game for adventure freaks&quot;.

Ron Boerger reviewed &quot;Enchanter&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 73. Boerger commented that &quot;&quot;Enchanter&quot; is [...] a lot of fun, and if you&#x27;re into the all-text, no-picture sort of roleplaying, I heartily recommend it.&quot;

<text>Amdang (also Biltine; autonym: &quot;sìmí amdangtí&quot;) is a language closely related to Fur, which together constitute a branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. It is mainly spoken in Chad, north of the town of Biltine, and sporadically elsewhere in Ouaddaï Region. There are also small colonies of speakers in Darfur near Woda&#x27;a and Fafa, and in Kordofan in the Abu Daza district and at Magrur north of Bara. Most of the ethnic group now speaks Arabic.

The language is also called Mimi, Mima or Biltine; the name &quot;Mimi&quot;, however, is also applied to two extinct Maban languages of the area; Mimi of Nachtigal and Mimi of Decorse.

Wolf (2010) provides lexical data for the Kouchane, Sounta, Yaouada, and Tere dialects of Amdang.

<text>The South Carolina State Museum is a museum dedicated to the history of South Carolina. It has four floors of permanent and changing exhibits, a digital dome planetarium, 4D interactive theater, and an observatory (all opened in 2014). The State Museum is located along the banks of the Congaree River in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. It is the largest museum in the state, and is a Smithsonian Affiliate and part of the American Alliance of Museums. Positioned on an old shipping canal (Columbia Canal) that dates back to pre-Civil War times, the museum is widely recognized as a resource for South Carolina history and lifestyle.

The museum opened on October 29, 1988, and is housed in what it calls its largest artifact: the former Columbia Mills Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. When the mill opened in 1894, manufacturing cotton duck cloth (a canvas-like material), it was the first completely electric textile mill in the world. It was also the first major industrial installation for the General Electric corporation. On certain levels of the museum, the original flooring has been kept intact, distinguishable by the textile brads and rings (that carried the threads during the spinning process) that became embedded in the floor while it was still being used as a mill. The South Carolina Confederate Relic Room &amp; Military Museum is located within the Columbia Mills Building and is the oldest museum exhibit (est. 1896) in Columbia.

The museum represents four distinct sections of South Carolina history: art, cultural history, science and technology, and natural history. Exhibits include life-size replicas of the Best Friend of Charleston- the first American-built locomotive in 1830, and the Civil War&#x27;s H.L. Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy ship in combat.

The second floor on natural history is notable for its recreation of a 3.6-million-year-old megalodon, named Finn, suspended mid-air just around a corner, and for a life-size Columbian mammoth (which was once native to SC). The Museum&#x27;s first natural history curator was Rudy Mancke, who went on to produce a national program on South Carolina Educational Television called NatureScene.

There is also the Lipscomb art gallery on the first floor, which features an iron gate made by Charleston&#x27;s Philip Simmons. The Cotton Mill Exchange gift shop sells South Carolina souvenirs and books and is located on the first floor. The museum restaurant, the Crescent Café, sells sandwiches and drinks. The museum has a 1989 mural of the nearby Gervais Street Bridge by Columbia&#x27;s Blue Sky (artist) in a room next to the Café. It has topiary sculpted by Bishopville&#x27;s Pearl Fryar in the parking lot. The Stringer Discovery Center for small children opened in 1997.

Travelling exhibitions at the State Museum have included &quot;Spanish Explorations in the Caribbean and the US, 1492-1570&quot; (for the 500th anniversary of Columbus&#x27; discovery) in 1990, WWII and SC in 1991 (for 50 years since the Pearl Harbor attack), &quot;Rock, Roll, and Remember: Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and Other SC Greats&quot; in 1997, The World of Insects in 1998, Star Trek: The Exhibition in 1999, The Magic School Bus in 1999, Inside Africa in 2004, Prehistoric Predators in 2004, Napoleon Bonaparte in 2006, Aliens: Worlds of Possibilities in 2007, Leonardo da Vinci in 2008, a 2008 exhibit on several of the movies (like The Patriot and Forrest Gump) filmed in SC (&quot;Hollywood Comes to South Carolina&quot;), &quot;Football in the Palmetto State, 1889-2000&quot; in 2008, Pirates in 2010, 150 years of the Civil War in SC in 2011, Body Worlds Vital in 2012, Titanic: the Artifact Exhibition (100 yr. anniversary) in 2012, Secrets of the Maya in 2012, King Tut in 2003 and 2013, Dinosaurs: A Bite Out of Time in 2014, Julius Caesar: Roman Military Might in 2015, &quot;RACE: Are We So Different?&quot; in 2016, Savage Ancient Seas in 2017, the 2017 Solar Eclipse in Columbia exhibit in the observatory, The Wizard of Oz in 2017 for Halloween, Hall of Heroes (superheroes) in 2019, 50 Years of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing (with items from SC astronaut Charles Duke) in 2019, and Sherlock Holmes: the International Exhibition in 2020 (with items from the Museum of London).

<text>Bill Smith (March 14, 1934 – February 28, 1996) was a professional poker player who won the 1985 World Series of Poker Main Event.

==Poker career==
Smith was a staple at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) during the 1980s. He was involved in three final tables of the Main Event. At the 1981 and 1986 WSOP, Smith placed fifth, but at the 1985 World Series of Poker he won the bracelet and $700,000. His total tournament winnings exceeded $1,050,000. His three cashes at the WSOP accounted for $788,800 of his lifetime winnings.

Smith often played professional poker tournaments drunk. By all accounts, he was an alcoholic.

According to fellow poker player T. J. Cloutier, Smith did not play well when he was sober or totally drunk. “Bill was the tightest player you&#x27;d ever played in your life when he was sober. And when he was halfway drunk, he was the best player I&#x27;d ever played with. No one could read opponents’ hands better than half- drunk Smith. But when he got past that halfway mark, he was the worst player I&#x27;d ever played with.” 

The year Smith won the Main Event, he entered the final day&#x27;s play sober and just sat there while he warmed up. After he started drinking, he accumulated a huge pile of chips by well-timed aggressive play. He had so many chips once he was totally drunk that good luck led him to victory.

Smith died on February 8, 1996.

<text>The iMac G5 is a series of all-in-one personal computers that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from 2004 to 2006. The iMac G5 returned to a more traditional design after the &quot;sunflower&quot; iMac G4, with the computer components fitted behind a liquid-crystal display and mounted on an aluminum foot. The computer was designed around the need to cool its PowerPC 970 processor, and features an interior divided into zones for cooler, quieter operation.

The iMac G5 was announced at the Apple Expo in Paris in August 2004, and was revised twice during its lifespan before being replaced by the first iMacs based on Intel processors. The iMac G5 was well received by critics, who noted its performance, quiet operation, and ease of use. Criticisms included its port placement, lack of ergonomic adjustments, and lack of base memory. The design established by the G5 iMacs would influence the design of subsequent models.

==Overview==
The iMac G5 is an all-in-one personal computer. The exterior is white, double-shot plastic. The machine has an integrated, flat 17- or liquid-crystal display (LCD), with the rest of the computer internals mounted behind it, or in a &quot;chin&quot; area below the display. The enclosure is deep on early models, and on later revisions. An L-shaped aluminum foot elevates the display off the resting surface and allows the screen to be tilted from between –5 to 25 degrees, though it does not offer height adjustment or side-to-side swiveling. A hole in the foot allows cables to be routed through it, and the entire foot on the early models be removed to use another mounting method. On the top right edge of the iMac is an optical drive using a slot-loading mechanism to save space. On the back of the machine is a single row of input/output ports: analog input and analog/digital outport, Universal Serial Bus (USB), FireWire, a dial-up modem, and ethernet. Initial models featured AirPort Express and Bluetooth wireless connectivity as optional add-ons. The iMac features speakers powered by a 12-watt amplifier, positioned at the bottom of the machine so that sound is reflected off the resting surface towards the user.

The G5 central processing unit is located under a large heat sink. To address the processor&#x27;s heat output, the interior of the iMac is divided into multiple cooling zones, with the system monitoring heat and ramping fan speeds only when needed for quieter operation. The fans draw air from the speaker grilles at the bottom of the case up through vents in the back. The graphics processing unit is integrated directly to the motherboard and thus cannot be easily upgraded. The Serial AT Attachment (SATA) hard drives and random-access memory (RAM) of the iMac were the same as the contemporaneous Power Mac G5. In initial iMac G5 models, the interior could be easily accessed through the back by the removal of three captive screws.

==Development==
Apple introduced the iMac G4 in January 2002, the first iMac with a LCD. The 15-inch launch model was supplemented by models with 17- and 20-inch displays. These larger displays challenged the iMac G4&#x27;s &quot;sunflower&quot; design, where the display was suspended above a base by an adjustable arm; the 20-inch model weighed almost twice as much as the 17-inch model due to the need to counterbalance the screen. The new PowerPC G5 processors that Apple first shipped with the Power Mac G5 also ran much hotter and required more cooling than the G4s they replaced; fitting them into Apple&#x27;s smaller desktop machines or laptops was a special difficulty. Apple marketing executive Greg Joswiak described the heart of the iMac as its all-in-one form factor, ease of use, focus on digital lifestyle applications, and innovative design, and that revamping it always meant keeping those factors in mind.

In redesigning the iMac, Apple went with an approach they had considered and then discarded with the G4 model—attaching the components behind the display. The new design kept the tilt adjustment from the previous model, and approximating swiveling by adding rubber feet on the base so that it could be easily adjusted; height adjustment was not included, with Joswiak justifying the change by saying that few customers raised or lowered their iMacs. To address the heat of the G5 processor, Apple divided the iMac&#x27;s interior into three cooling zones: the processor, the hard drive, and the power supply and logic board. &quot;By doing the three different cooling areas, we take a big heating challenge and break it into smaller ones, which is really the essence of good thermal design,&quot; Joswiak said. This allowed the machine to have quieter fans that only ran as fast—and as loudly—as needed. The new design allowed the design team to integrate the stereo speakers into the case, which had been a design concession of the previous model. The iMac&#x27;s white exterior followed the similar look of the iMac G4 and the iPod music player. Jony Ive found the color bold yet restrained.

== Release==

The iMac G5 was formally announced at the Paris Mac Expo on August 31, 2004, and shipped in September. Advertising for the new iMac visually linked it to the iPod, by then fast becoming Apple&#x27;s most important product; advertisements for the computer placed it alongside the music player and contained the tagline &quot;From the creators of iPod.&quot; Apple focused on selling iMacs to iPod users via the Halo effect for the Apple brand. The company sought to allay concerns that the success of the iPod was to the detriment of the Mac division; &quot;I really hope that when they see this iMac that it shows that it&#x27;s not the case,&quot; Apple executive Phil Schiller told analysts. &quot;We are applying our innovation and engineering design talents to everything we do, including the iPod and all of our Mac product lines.&quot;

The machine initially came in three configurations. A low-end 17-inch model featured a 1.6 GHz processor, 256MB of memory, an 80GB hard drive, and a DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive. A midrange model added a faster processor and the ability to burn DVDs, while the high-end model added a larger hard drive to pair with a 20-inch display. The high-end prices were hundreds of dollars less than the G4 models they replaced. Exclusively for the education market, Apple offered a cheaper model with a worse graphics chipset and smaller hard drive.

The iMac G5 was updated in March 2005. The new models featured faster processors, more memory, larger hard drives, improved graphics, and double-layer optical drives (capable of burning 8.5GB DVDs.) The computer&#x27;s networking was also improved with Gigabit Ethernet, and AirPort and Bluetooth now standard features.

In October 2005, the iMac was revised again, with a slimmer, internally new design. The new models featured an integrated iSight webcam mounted above the LCD. The iMac shipped with a remote for use with Apple&#x27;s Front Row media interface. Other improvements included faster processors, more RAM, larger hard drives, and improved graphics. SuperDrives became standard across the line. The computers also included the Apple Mighty Mouse. It became the first Apple computer to use the PCI Express expansion bus and DDR2 SDRAM. The stand could no longer be replaced with a VESA mount, and the computer no longer included modems. The internals were more difficult to access.

In January 2006, the iMac G5 was succeeded by a new line featuring Intel processors, beginning the transition of Apple&#x27;s entire line of computers to the Intel architecture six months ahead of schedule. These machines were outwardly similar to the G5 models they replaced.

==Reception==
The iMac G5 was generally positively-received. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Walt Mossberg and &quot;The Detroit Free Press&quot;″s Mike Wendland called the iMac the best computer they had ever used. Multiple publications recommended the machine as an option for Windows PC users to switch to Macs. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Jason Snell called it a glimpse of the future of where consumer computers would end up.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s David Pogue suggested that the design of the iMac G5 was so similar to the iPod to visually entice buyers of the latter to try the all-in-one. The design was often called conservative or predictable compared to its predecessors, although &quot;Wired&quot; considered the G5&#x27;s simplicity an improvement over the &quot;freakish and odd&quot; G4. Mossberg noted that while Apple was not the first all-in-one computer to sit behind an LCD, it was thinner and more attractive than the competition.

Its performance was often favorably compared to the more expensive Power Macs, with some critics suggesting the only reason to get the more expensive models was if consumers needed to add expansion or graphics cards. In comparison, &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;″s Mark Wherry felt that an entry-level Power Mac G5 offered much more flexibility for not much more money, especially if sound designers or other audio-focused users wanted to separate the screen from the computer for noise purposes. Mossberg noted that despite the stereotype that Macs were more expensive than Windows PCs, the iMac was comparably priced to the competition. Pogue, Wendland, and &quot;Computerworld&quot;″s Yuval Kossovsky noted the machine&#x27;s near-inaudible operation, which Pogue considered doubly impressive given the heat generated by the high-performance internals.

In comparison to the ergonomics of the iMac G4, the iMac G5&#x27;s lack of height adjustment was criticized. 
Other complaints included the low amount of standard memory, and the lack of forward-facing ports so that peripherals could be more easily connected. Norr felt the sound from the iMac&#x27;s built-in speakers was not as good as the external speakers that shipped with the iMac G4. While the initial model&#x27;s ease of repair and upgrade was praised, The iSight models&#x27; lack of repairability was also criticized as a step back. Early iMacs suffered from capacitors failing due to heat and faulty power supplies, which would result in Apple offering a repair program for the machines.

The iMac G5&#x27;s design proved to be the template for successive iMac generations, with subsequent models slimming down the enclosure while growing more powerful. Designer Jordan Merrick summed up the iMac G5 as the &quot;mature&quot; evolution of the iMac line, with its &quot;deliberate lack of any ostentatious characteristics&quot; presaging the more minimalist style Apple would take with their future computers.

<doc id="983945" wikidata="Q2469925" url="?curid=983945" title="Jerahmeel (archangel)">
<text>The Hebrew name Jerahmeel (Hebrew: יְרַחְמְאֵל &quot;Yəraḥməʾēl&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;Yăraḥmē̆ʾēl,&quot; &quot;God shall have mercy&quot;), which appears several times in the Tanakh (see the article Jerahmeel), also appears in various forms as the name of an archangel in books of the intertestamental and early Christian periods.

== Scripture ==
The book 2 Esdras, also known as 4 Ezra, is regarded as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and falls within the intertestamental books of the Apocrypha in Protestant Bibles used by the Lutheran Churches and the Anglican Communion; it has come down to us in Latin and appears as an appendix to the Vulgate. There is a reference in chapter 4 verse 36, to Jeremiel (in the Latin Ieremihel), which, however, does not occur in all the manuscripts. Other versions have Remiel or Uriel. In this passage, the angel or angels (Uriel is also there) are answering Ezra&#x27;s many questions about heaven and hell.

Jeremiel (under any of his name alterations: Eremiel, Remiel, etc.) had a very dour yet comforting duty in the pre-Christian eras. He is mentioned in Chapter 20 of the Book of Enoch written around [300 B.C.] as Remiel; one of the seven holy angels whom God set over those who rise.

Later on in Christian theology, he was set over Sheol (the underworld) in Abrahamic tradition, in particular the &quot;Bosom of Abraham&quot;, a region of the underworld almost identical in concept to the Greek idea of Elysium. Here Jeremiel was responsible for placating the righteous souls awaiting the Lord who resided there. In post-Christian world Jeremiel&#x27;s duty evolved and is paired with St. Simon Peter as gatekeeper of Heaven. In both cases, Jeremiel watches over and guides the holy deceased in their afterlife journey. Possibly due to influence of Enoch 1 written earlier.

In the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, an apocryphal book which has come down to us in Coptic, the angel referred to as Eremiel tells Zephaniah I am the great angel, Eremiel, who is over the abyss and Hades, the one in which all of the souls are imprisoned from the end of the Flood, which came upon the earth, until this day

For modern uses of the angel&#x27;s name and identity, see the article Ramiel.

== Enumeration ==
There are seven to eight archangels venerated by the Orthodox Christians: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Selathiel, Jegudiel, and Barachiel, with an eighth, Jeremiel, added to this number. He is depicted holding balance scales in Orthodox iconography. In the Lutheran and Anglican traditions, three to five archangels are recognized, including Michael the Archangel and Gabriel the Archangel (who are mentioned in the canonical books), as well as Raphael the Archangel, Uriel the Archangel and Jerahmeel the Archangel (who are named in the intertestamental books of the Protestant Apocrypha).

<text>Theaetetus is a lunar impact crater that is located to the southeast of the crater Cassini near the eastern edge of Mare Imbrium. It was named after the ancient Greek mathematician Theaetetus. It lies just to the west of the Montes Caucasus range, which forms the eastern shore of the mare. To the southwest is the prominent crater Aristillus.

The rim of Theaetetus is distinctly polygonal in shape, with a slight rounding at the vertices. There is a low outer and a slight central rise on the crater floor, which is offset to the northeast of the crater midpoint. The interior is otherwise relatively featureless. 
This crater has been noted in the past as a site of possible transient lunar phenomena. In 1902, a white cloud was observed briefly in the vicinity of the crater. Other observers, including Patrick Moore and W. H. Pickering, have also noted unusual appearances in this area.

Central Square was designated an official Cultural District in the state of Massachusetts by the Mass Cultural Council in October 2012. Central Square is known for its wide variety of ethnic restaurants, churches, bars, and live music and theatre venues. Richard B. Modica Way, aka &quot;Graffiti Alley&quot;, has been described as a &quot;hallmark of Central Square.&quot; It is gentrifying rapidly, and a number of upscale restaurants have opened in the Square. Many startups, including pharmaceutical, videogame and Internet companies, have moved research and office operations into the Square to take advantage of the proximity to MIT, Boston medical resources and relatively low costs. Some critics have claimed that the recent changes have diminished the Square&#x27;s edge, as some of the older Square businesses such as Manray have closed. There is also a diverse array of houses of worship in the area, with Christ the King Presbyterian Church, First Baptist Church, Sts. Constantine &amp; Helen Greek Orthodox Church, St. Paul&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church and other large historic congregations meeting near the Square.
==History==

Central Square&#x27;s history has been marked by several waves of immigration. The original population of the Square included people of English and Canadian ancestry. Between 1850 and 1890, the Square attracted many Irish immigrants, and in the late Nineteenth Century also became home to many others from throughout Europe. Later waves of immigration included people from the West Indies, South America and Africa.

Central Square is also the original home of actor Ben Affleck and, from 1927 to 2003, the Necco factory. The old Necco factory building in Cambridge is now used for labs by Novartis.

==Geography and transportation==
Several Cambridge neighborhoods meet at Central Square. To the east, Area 4 lies on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue (aka &quot;Mass Ave.&quot;) and Cambridgeport on the south side between Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Both of these neighborhoods were once known as The Port or Old Port region of Cambridge. The area to the west and northwest of Central Square is known as Mid-Cambridge.

Central Square is accessible from Central station on the MBTA Red Line, as well as Buses 1, 64, 70, 83, and 91.

The intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Brookline in front of The Middle East in Central Square is named in honor of the late indie rock musician Mark Sandman, who often played there.

Central Square serves as the commercial center for the surrounding neighborhoods of Cambridgeport, Riverside, Mid Cambridge, Area 4 and MIT.

==Local government services==
Central Square is the seat of government in Cambridge. Cambridge City Hall, and the main branch of the Cambridge Post Office are located in this area. The Cambridge Police Department headquarters was formerly at 5 Western Avenue in the Central Square area; however, between November 2008 and March 2009 it completed a relocation to a new facility at 125 Sixth Street, near Kendall Square.

<doc id="983951" wikidata="Q7338072" url="?curid=983951" title="Riverbanks Zoo">
<text>The Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is a zoo, aquarium, and botanical garden located along the Saluda River in Columbia, South Carolina, United States. A small portion of the zoo extends into the nearby city of West Columbia. It is operated by the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park Special Purpose District, a partnership of the city of Columbia and Richland and Lexington counties. It is overseen by the Riverbanks Park Commission, comprising two members each from the three governments and one at-large member.

Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

==History==
In the early 1960s, Columbia-area businessmen conceived of a zoo for the state capital. However, the idea did not get beyond the planning stages until 1969, when the state created the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park Special Purpose District to run the proposed zoo. The zoo opened on April 25, 1974 after 5 years of planning. The planning stage was crucial because of the rich history surrounding the property, including four archeological sites. Within two years, it was obvious that the zoo would not be self-supporting, and the Riverbanks Zoological Society was created to help raise money for the zoo. At the same time, Palmer &quot;Satch&quot; Krantz was appointed executive director. Notable features of the original Zoo design were the mountainous, moated exhibits for big cats and bears.

Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is South Carolina&#x27;s largest gated attraction, averaging over one million visitors each year—a considerable amount for a zoo serving a region as small as Columbia (the Columbia metropolitan area has only 800,000 people). Riverbanks is a four-time winner of the Southeastern Tourism Society&#x27;s Shining Example Award as the Southeast&#x27;s top tourist attraction and a two-time winner of the SC Parks Recreation and Tourism Governor&#x27;s Cup Award as South Carolina&#x27;s Leading Attraction.

==Animals and exhibits==
The zoo is home to over 2,000 animals, with collections of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. In 2002, additions included exhibits for African elephants, gorillas, and koalas. The Birdhouse at Riverbanks (opened 2001) was given a Significant Achievement Award by the AZA as one of the best new zoo exhibits in the United States, and features a display of king, rockhopper, and gentoo penguins. The Zoo 2002 plan cost $15 million.

&quot;African Plains&quot; is a pair of exhibits featuring giraffe (including a paid feeding station), as well as Grant&#x27;s zebra, and ostrich in the other.

The &quot;Aquarium Reptile Complex&quot; (opened in 1989 as part of the Zoo II plan) is a building with a tank for Pacific coral reef species, as well as exhibits for Galapagos tortoises, false gharials, Komodo dragons, and other reptiles. There is a Galapagos tortoise sculpture next to it. In September 2021, the complex was closed for one year in order to undergo major revisions.

Opened in 2002, &quot;Ndoki Forest&quot; was designed to house two of the larger African species, the African elephant and western lowland gorilla, as well as slender-tailed meerkat, various birds, and formerly de Brazza&#x27;s monkeys. The elephants once lived in a renovated yard with a pool. As of November 20, 2019 the last elephant was transported to the Milwaukee County Zoo in Wisconsin. The closing of the elephant exhibit made room for a Southern white rhino exhibit, opened in summer of 2020.

&quot;Riverbanks Farm&quot; (opened in 1988) contains domestic animals and allows guests to feed the zoo&#x27;s goats and alpacas. &quot;Lemur Island&quot; was a former exhibit including ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs, later replaced by the rebuilt sea lion exhibit. &quot;Conservation Outpost&quot; features threatened species such as golden lion tamarins, fishing cats, and the aforementioned lemurs. In 1983, the Education Center opened for Zoo Camp.

&quot;Kangaroo Walkabout&quot; is another modern addition. It has a path leading into the exhibit where visitors can view wallabies and red kangaroos without a barrier between them. However, visitors cannot stray from the path.

The Riverbanks Zoo added a Malayan tapir on January 18, 2013, since deceased; as well as a breeding pair of North Sulawesi babirusas in 2012. The babirusas have successfully been bred and can be found in the previous warthog exhibit.

In June 2016, a new sea lion and harbor seal exhibit was opened, which is modeled after San Francisco&#x27;s Pier 39. This new exhibit includes four sea lions and one harbor seal in a 250,000-gallon saltwater habitat. Around that time the newly renovated entrance, renovated otter exhibit, and renovated grizzly bear exhibit also opened. This was all part of the zoo&#x27;s $36 million Destination Riverbanks plan. Additionally, a children&#x27;s garden opened in 2016, complete with a dinosaur digging area and water features to interact with. This garden has been the largest addition to the zoo since the botanical garden in 1995.

Separate exhibits include Hamadryas baboons, lions, Siberian tiger, meerkats, alligators, and siamangs.

In May 2022, Riverbanks announced their new Bridge to the Wild plan, which aims to extend the zoo into the gardens. Plans include a new restaurant, as well as new species including orangutans, gibbons, red wolves, American black bears, and golden eagles. Phase two of this plan was approved in December 2023, with approximately $80 million invested from both Richland county and Lexington county. This project is planned to have a significant impact on tourism, local education, and potential job opportunities.

The last original animal who had been there since the zoo&#x27;s opening, a female Caribbean flamingo, died in March 2014.

==Botanical garden==
Riverbanks also has a botanical garden (opened on June 10, 1995 at the cost of $6 million) with more than 4,200 species of native and exotic plants, and some sculptures. A trail system lets visitors explore several kilometers of bottomland and upland mixed hardwood forests in search of the native wildlife that call the Zoo and Garden home.

==Waterfall Junction==
Waterfall Junction (opened in April 2016) is a children&#x27;s play area that includes a splashpad, playground, playhouses, and more.

<doc id="983952" wikidata="Q5354574" url="?curid=983952" title="Elections Alberta">
<text>Elections Alberta is an independent, non-partisan office of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta responsible for administering provincial elections, by-elections, and referendums within the province. This is in accordance with the Alberta Election Act. Elections Alberta also oversees political parties and candidates in accordance with the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act.

==History==
The Office of the Chief Electoral Officer (Elections Alberta), was created in 1977 to act as an independent body to oversee Alberta&#x27;s Elections Finances and Contribution Disclosure Act and Election Act. Prior to 1977, these acts were overseen by the clerk of the Legislative Assembly.

==Jurisdiction==
Elections Alberta oversees the creation of political parties and riding associations, compiles election statistics on ridings, and collects financial statements from party candidates and riding associations. It maintains a list of electors, through enumeration that occurs before an election. Elections Alberta is also responsible for enacting legislation relating to elections passed in the Legislative Assembly, including electoral boundary changes and Elections finance laws.

==Services==
Elections Alberta is tasked with printing and distributing maps and Elections Alberta–related campaign materials and guides to candidates and party officials. It is mandated to issue an annual report, as well as reports after each election. These reports contain new and deregistered riding associations, party executives and contact information, donations to parties, changes to electors data, election cost by riding and as a whole, the names of returning officers are among the information in annual reports.

==Electoral Boundaries Commission==
Electoral boundary changes come from the Alberta Electoral Boundaries Commission, made up of five appointed members. The commission collects input from residents and politicians, then draws up the divisions based on enumeration and census data. A bill is then introduced and voted on in the Legislative Assembly. Minor changes may be made and introduced by members. Changes are then implemented by the chief electoral officer.

An expansion from 83 to 87 ridings was recommended by the commission in June 2010, and their report with the new riding boundaries was in effect for the April 2012 general election.

On recommendation from the Chief Electoral Officer, Glen Resler, Bill 7 was introduced on April 12, 2016, which amended the Electoral Boundaries Commission Act to authorize the appointment of a commission on or before October 31, 2016. This is so that there was sufficient time for Elections Alberta to implement the new boundaries in time for the 2019 Alberta general election.

==Candidacy fees and refunds==
In 1905, the nomination deposit was set at $100, a figure that was well beyond the means of ordinary citizens at the time. Despite inflation, this fee was not changed until 1992 when it was doubled to $200, thus remaining a nominal sum to many Albertans. In 2004, the government controversially increased the required deposit again, to $500, although it became easier to get half of the new deposit back. The government contended that the increase was necessary to deter frivolous candidacies, encourage timely filing of financial statements, and help pay for Elections Alberta&#x27;s expenses. Some smaller parties argue that an excessively high deposit represents an unacceptable &quot;user fee&quot; on democracy.

Prior to the 2004 general election a candidate received their deposit back if they were elected or received at least one half the votes of the elected candidate. Candidates who failed to meet these benchmarks forfeited their deposits. Starting with the 2004 election however, the refund policy described above only applies to half of the new deposit ($250). The other half of the deposit is refunded if the candidate files the required financial statements with Elections Alberta within the prescribed time frame, regardless of how many votes they receive. Therefore, a failed candidate who files timely financial statements would lose $250. A change in legislation in 2010 led to the deposit being fully refundable to candidates who file their post-election financial report on time.

Prospective senate nominees are required to deposit $4,000 along with nomination papers signed by 1,500 Albertans. Candidates must be at least 30 years old in accordance with the Constitution of Canada requirement that senators own $4,000 worth of property.

==Senate nominees==
Alberta began to hold Alberta Senate nominee elections in 1989 and remains the only province to do so. The three candidates who receive the most votes are recommended to the Canadian prime minister as Senate candidates, but there is no legal or constitutional obligation to appoint them. The prime minister has appointed three nominees to the Senate: Reform Party member Stan Waters in 1990 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Bert Brown in 2007 and Doug Black in 2013, both by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The winners of the April 23, 2012 Senate nominee election were all Progressive Conservative Party candidates, Doug Black, Scott Tannas, and Mike Shaikh. Doug Black received the most votes and was consequently appointed to the Senate on January 25, 2013.

She was built by William Pickersgill &amp; Sons Ltd. in Sunderland, launched on 12 October 1943 and completed in February 1944.

In World War II she served in the B3 Escort Group, protecting Atlantic convoys until the end of the war in 1945. She then joined the Anti-Submarine Training Squadron at the Portland, United Kingdom, and continued in this role until she was paid off at Chatham, England, United Kingdom in November 1956, after serving a total of years. As with other surviving Castle-class corvettes, she had been redesigned as a frigate in 1948 and her pennant number accordingly changed to F384.

<text>Le Puy-en-Velay (, ; , before 1988: &quot;Le Puy&quot;) is the prefecture of the Haute-Loire department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of south-central France.

Located near the river Loire, the city is famous for its cathedral, for a kind of lentil, for its lace-making, as well as for being the origin of the &quot;Chemin du Puy,&quot; one of the principal origin points of the pilgrimage route of Santiago de Compostela in France. In 2021, the commune had a population of 18,629.

==History==

Le Puy-en-Velay was a major bishopric by the early period of medieval France. Its foundation is largely legendary. According to a martyrology compiled by Ado of Vienne, published in many copies in 858, and supplemented in the mid-10th century by Gauzbert of Limoges, a priest named George accompanied a certain Front, the first Bishop of Périgueux, when they were sent to proselytize in Gaul. Front was added to the list of the apostles to Gaul, who in tradition are described as being sent out to reorganize Christians after the persecutions that are associated with Decius, circa 250. As with others of the group, notably Saint Martial of Limoges, later mythology pushed the activities of Saint Front and the priest George back in time. It tells that George had been restored to life with a touch of Saint Peter&#x27;s staff.

The expanding legend of this St. George, which, according to the Church historian Louis Duchesne is not earlier than the 11th century, then makes that saint one of the seventy disciples of the Gospel of Luke. It tells that he founded the church of the &quot;[civitas] que dicitur Vetula in pago Vellavorum&quot;, the city &quot;called Vetula in the &quot;pays&quot; of the Vellavii&quot; was how a document of 1004 termed it. This was what the settlement of Ruessium began to be called during the 4th century. &quot;Vetula&quot; means &quot;the old woman&quot;, and pagans were still making small images of her as late as the 6th century in Flanders, according to the &quot;vita&quot; of Saint Eligius. This was the first cathedral at Le Puy.
Following St. George the founder, later medieval local traditions evoke a legendary list of bishops at this chief town of the &quot;pays&quot; of Le Velay: Macarius, Marcellinus, Roricius, Eusebius, Paulianus, and Vosy (Evodius), all of them canonized by local veneration. The Gaulish settlement of Ruessium/Vellavorum was given its Christianizing name, Saint-Paulien, from Bishop Paulianus. A bishop Evodius attended the Council of Valence in 374.

In the early 1180s peasants of Le Puy, led by a carpenter named Durandus, formed a &quot;conspiratio&quot; (sworn association) called the &quot;Capuciati&quot; (because of the white hoods they wore as a sign of their conspiratio). They challenged seigneurial dominance in a short-lived attempt at reformation.

===Our Lady of Le Puy===

The Christianization legends of &quot;Mons Anicius&quot; relate that at the request of Bishop Martial of Limoges, Bishop Evodius/Vosy ordered an altar to the Virgin Mary to be erected on the pinnacle that surmounts Mont Anis. Some such beginning of the shrine Christianized the pagan site; it later became the altar site of the cathedral of Le Puy. This marked one starting-point or meeting-point for the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela, a walk of some 1600 km, as it still does today. The old town of Le Puy developed around the base of the cathedral.

Pilgrims were early visitors to Le Puy, and it was the most popular destination in France during the Middle Ages. Charlemagne came twice, in 772 and 800. There is a legend that in 772, he established a foundation at the cathedral for ten poor canons (&quot;chanoines de paupérie&quot;), and he chose Le Puy, with Aachen and Saint-Gilles, as a center for the collection of Peter&#x27;s Pence. Other notable medieval visitors to Le Puy were Charles the Bald in 877, Odo, count of Paris in 892, Robert II in 1029, and Philip Augustus in 1183.

Louis IX met James I of Aragon here in 1245, and in 1254, when passing through Le Puy on his return from the Holy Land, he gave the cathedral an ebony image of the Blessed Virgin clothed in gold brocade. She is one of the many dozens of venerable &quot;Black Virgins&quot; of France. It was destroyed during the Revolution, but replaced at the Restoration with a copy that continues to be venerated. After him, Le Puy was visited by Philip the Bold in 1282, by Philip the Fair in 1285, by Charles VI in 1394, by Charles VII in 1420, and by Isabelle Romée, the mother of Joan of Arc, in 1429. Louis XI made the pilgrimage in 1436 and 1475, and in 1476 halted three leagues from the city and walked barefoot to the cathedral. Charles VIII visited it in 1495, Francis I in 1533.

The legendary ancient shrine on the summit of Mons Anicius, which drew so many, would seem to predate the founding of an early church of Our Lady of Le Puy at Anicium. It was attributed to Bishop Vosy, who transferred the episcopal see from Ruessium to Anicium. Crowning the hill was a megalithic dolmen. A local tradition rededicated the curative virtue of the sacred site to Mary, who healed ailments when a person touched the standing stone. When the founding bishop Vosy climbed the hill, he found that it was snow-covered in July; in the snowfall the tracks of a deer around the dolmen outlined the foundations of the future church. The Bishop was apprised in a vision that the angels themselves had dedicated the future cathedral to the Blessed Virgin, whence the epithet &quot;Angelic&quot; given to the cathedral of Le Puy. The great dolmen was left standing in the center of the Christian sanctuary, which was constructed around it; the stone was re-consecrated as the Throne of Mary. By the 8th century, however, the stone, popularly known as the &quot;stone of visions&quot;, was taken down and broken up. Its pieces were incorporated into the floor of a particular section of the church that came to be called the &quot;Chambre Angélique&quot;, or the &quot;angels&#x27; chamber&quot;.

It is impossible to say whether this St. Evodius is the same person who signed the decrees of the Council of Valence in 374. Neither can it be affirmed that St. Benignus, who in the 7th century founded a hospital at the gates of the basilica, and St. Agrevius, the 7th-century martyr from whom the town of Saint-Agrève Chiniacum took its name, were really bishops. Duchesne thinks that the chronology of these early bishops rests on very little evidence and that very ill-supported by documents. Before the 10th century, only six individuals are known of whom it can be said with certainty that they were bishops of Le Puy. The first of these, Scutarius, the legendary architect of the first cathedral, dates from the end of the 4th century according to an inscription that notes his name..

Adhemar, bishop of Le Puy was a central figure in the First Crusade. Pope Clement IV was also bishop of Le Puy.

Though the ancient diocese was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, it was re-erected in 1823.

In February 1965, Le Puy absorbed the former commune Taulhac-près-le-Puy.

==Climate==
Because of its altitude, Le Puy is close to a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) under the Köppen system but still remains oceanic (Cfb) due to its coldest month, slightly above freezing on average. The city is prone to mountain cold in winter, with at least four months with average lows below freezing and frequent snowfall, like in Saint-Étienne in the neighbouring department of Loire. Summers are pleasantly warm, with quite hot days and cool nights. On the 5th of March 2005, the temperature dipped to −22 °C.

==Sights==

Le Puy-en-Velay&#x27;s most striking attraction is the Cathédrale Notre-Dame du Puy, dating chiefly from the first half of the 12th century. The façade, striped in courses of white sandstone and black volcanic breccia, is reached by a flight of sixty steps, and consists of three orders, the lowest composed of three high arcades opening into the porch, which extends beneath the first bays of the nave. Above it are three central windows that light the nave, and above them are three gables on the gable-end of the nave, flanked by two openwork screening gables. The south transept doorway is sheltered by a Romanesque porch. Behind the choir rises a separate Romanesque bell-tower in seven storeys.

The bays of the nave are roofed by octagonal cupolas, the cupola at the crossing forming a lantern; the choir and transepts are barrel vaulted. The striking parti-colored cloister is connected to remains of 13th-century fortifications that separated the cathedral precincts from the rest of the city. Near the cathedral, the 11th-century baptistery of St John is built on Roman foundations.

The iron statue of &quot;Notre-Dame de France&quot; (The Virgin Mary) overlooking the town was designed by the French sculptor Jean-Marie Bonnassieux, and is made from 213 Russian cannons taken in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855). It was presented to the town on 12 September 1860 in front of 120,000 people.

Three miles from Le Puy are the ruins of the Château de Polignac, one of the most important feudal strongholds.

Each morning, pilgrims gather to be blessed before starting their journey to Santiago de Compostela. The cathedral has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1998, as part of the &quot;Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France&quot;. Fountain Crozatier is also a noted site in the centre of the town.

Le-Puy-en-Velay is twinned with:
* Brugherio, Italy
* Mangualde, Portugal
* Meschede, Germany
* Tonbridge and Malling, England, United Kingdom

== Gastronomy ==

Le Puy is famous for a particular strain of green lentils and for its green liqueur &quot;Verveine&quot; flavored with verbena.

The lentils, grown on the thin soils of the area, are very small and almost black in colour. Their unique quality and flavour derive from their high protein and relatively low carbohydrate content. They are widely used in soups and also to accompany goose, duck and sausage dishes. Le Puy green lentil (Lentille Verte du Puy) is an appellation recognised throughout the European Union (Protected Designation of Origin).

==Noteworthy events==
===Catholic Jubilee===
The town holds a jubilee in years when the feast of the Annunciation falls on Good Friday.
The Jubilee of Le Puy (see Jubilé du Puy-en-Velay in the French Wikipedia) occurred last in 2005 and 2016, but the next occurrence will not be until 2157. The Jubilee of Le Puy is the oldest aside from those of Rome and Jerusalem, taking its original cue from the statement of a monk Bernhard who predicted the end of the world in 992 when the feast of the Annunciation would fall on Good Friday. The number of pilgrims to Le Puy was so remarkable that, after the dread date had safely passed, Pope John XV declared that each such date would be marked by a Jubilee. The first such anniversary occurred in 1065. In the Jubilee of 1407, the press of the crowd was so great that two hundred pilgrims suffocated. Of three Jubilees in the 20th century, the Jubilee of 1932 attracted over 300,000 pilgrims.

===Tour de France===
Le Puy has hosted the Tour de France on six occasions. In 1954, it was the finish town of stage 15, from Millau, which was won by Dominique Forlini. The next day, Jean Forestier won the race from Le Puy to Lyon. The race did not return until 1990, when the riders retraced their predecessors&#x27; route to Millau. Marino Lejarreta won the day. In 1996 the town again hosted two stages, stage 12 from Valence, won by Pascal Richard, and stage 13 to Super-Besse, won by Rolf Sørensen. Recently, Giuseppe Guerini won the stage from Issoire in 2005. Stage 15 of the 2017 Tour de France finished in Le Puy-en-Velay. It was won by Bauke Mollema of Trek-Segafredo.

===Fête du Roi de l&#x27;Oiseau===
It is an annual event held for five days in late September, during which the attendants reenact a Renaissance style living, showcasing costumes, culinary traditions and spectacles inspired by the 16th century.

<text>Manoao ( ) is a monotypic genus in the family &quot;Podocarpaceae.&quot; The single species, M. colensoi, known as manoao (Māori), silver pine, [[Manoao|Westland]]pine, or white silver pine, is endemic to New Zealand. Before 1996 it was classified in genus &quot;Dacrydium&quot; or &quot;Lagarostrobos&quot;, but has recently been recognised as a distinct genus; some botanists still treat it in &quot;Lagarostrobos&quot; on the basis that it is not phylogenetically distinct from that genus. In molecular phylogenetic analyses &quot;Manoao&quot; was found to be related to &quot;Parasitaxus&quot; (a parasitic and monotypic genus from New Caledonia) and &quot;Lagarostrobos&quot; (a single species from Tasmania when narrowly defined), but their exact relationships are unresolved.

&quot;Manoao colensoi&quot; is a slow-growing evergreen tree up to in height, in shady, wet areas of New Zealand. It is a source of fine, straight and durable timber.

== Distribution ==
&quot;M. colensoi&quot; can be found in the North Island from Te Paki southwards to Mount Ruapehu. However it is common only in the central North Island. It is also found in the western South Island.

<doc id="983972" wikidata="Q110607" url="?curid=983972" title="Clannad (video game)">
<text>Clannad is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key and released on April 28, 2004, for Windows. While both of Key&#x27;s first two previous works, &quot;Kanon&quot; and &quot;Air&quot;, had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market, &quot;Clannad&quot; was specifically made for all ages. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch consoles. An English version for Windows was released on Steam by Sekai Project in 2015.

The story follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki, from adolescence to adulthood. As an average high school student, he meets many people in his last year at school, including five girls, whose individual problems he helps resolve, and his life is further detailed after graduating from high school. The gameplay of &quot;Clannad&quot; follows a plot that branches into different scenarios based on various courses of interaction by the player character. The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off titled &quot;Tomoyo After: It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; in November 2005, which expanded on the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from &quot;Clannad&quot;.

&quot;Clannad&quot; has made several transitions to other media. There have been four manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works, Flex Comix, Fujimi Shobo and Jive. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books have also been published, as have audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated film adaptation by Toei Animation was released in September 2007, followed by two anime television series including two original video animation (OVA) episodes by Kyoto Animation produced between 2007 and 2009. Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are licensed by Sentai Filmworks and were released in North America in 2009. The animated adaptations have received high sales figures in Japan as well as critical acclaim abroad.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Clannad&quot; is a drama and romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story&#x27;s narrative and dialogue. &quot;Clannad&quot; follows a branching plot line with multiple paths and endings. There are six main plotlines that the player can experience, five which are initially available. At various points during gameplay, the player is given a dialog choice that can influence the progression of the story.

When first playing the game, the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life story arc. When the player completes a character&#x27;s scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game&#x27;s second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of &quot;Clannad&quot;, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game&#x27;s complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.

==Story==
===Setting and themes===
The first half of the story takes place primarily at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa&#x27;s parents, and the dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half.

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer Jun Maeda mistakenly thought the name of the Irish band Clannad meant &quot;clan&quot; or &quot;family&quot; in Irish, which is just &quot;clann&quot;. Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa&#x27;s story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a &quot;perfect family&quot; with a focus on mental consciousness. In Nagisa&#x27;s story, there is a recurring appearance of (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. Tomoya&#x27;s and Nagisa&#x27;s characters were written in a style to exemplify a &quot;growth to adulthood&quot; by the end of the story. Fuko&#x27;s and Kyou&#x27;s stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo&#x27;s story is influenced by her entire family. A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, &quot;Mag Mell&quot;, which means roughly &quot;plain of joy&quot; and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts.

===Main characters===

The player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of &quot;Clannad&quot;. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the beginning of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where &quot;Clannad&quot; is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.

Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, the main heroine of &quot;Clannad&quot;, at the onset of the story. Nagisa is a shy, lonely girl who has an illness which causes her to rely on those around her for support. Bullied by her schoolmates, she lacks the courage to make new friends. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of &quot;Clannad&quot; heroines, is an aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angered, she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.

Tomoya meets a genius girl named Kotomi Ichinose, one day in the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a tacit girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. &quot;Clannad&quot; fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya&#x27;s school. Tomoyo is known to be a strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key&#x27;s fifth game, &quot;Tomoyo After: It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, as the main heroine.

The last heroine in &quot;Clannad&quot; is a first-year student named Fuko Ibuki who is hyperactive and childish, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.

===Plot===
&quot;Clannad&quot; story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya&#x27;s mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya&#x27;s father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya&#x27;s shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya to constantly stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya&#x27;s good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.

The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a strange girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.

====After Story====
In the second part of the story, which starts immediately after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa&#x27;s illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa&#x27;s parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father&#x27;s traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya&#x27;s current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.

Tomoya&#x27;s psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world, called the , where small orbs of light float around. In the first few dreams, he sees a world devoid of all life, except for one girl. Each time he dreams, he finds out more about the world. Tomoya discovers that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things, which she uses to create a body for him. Over time, Tomoya comes to the conclusion that only the two of them are &quot;alive&quot;. To pass time, Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find, but as it has no soul, it fails to come to life. Remembering the distant world where he came from, Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the approaching winter and continue to live a happy life. Eventually, winter sets in, and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more. The girl tells Tomoya that he has another chance to go back and make things right. To do so, he must collect certain &quot;lights&quot; (symbols of happiness) similar to those floating around in the Illusionary World. If all the &quot;lights&quot; are collected throughout both story parts, a chance to save Nagisa from dying will become available, as well as the true ending, where she survives and lives with Tomoya and Ushio.

==Development==
The executive producer for &quot;Clannad&quot; was Takahiro Baba from Visual Arts, the publishing company which controls Key. Jun Maeda, who was one of three main scenario writers with Kai, and Yūichi Suzumoto, led the planning for &quot;Clannad&quot; and wrote the majority of the scenarios. Scenario assistance was provided by Tōya Okano. Itaru Hinoue headed the art direction, and also worked on the character design. Miracle Mikipon, Mochisuke, Na-Ga, and Shinory supplemented the computer graphics. Torino provided the background art. The game&#x27;s music was composed by Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi.

For Key&#x27;s second visual novel &quot;Air&quot;, Maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for the game&#x27;s scenario, but he later discovered that &quot;Air&quot; was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key&#x27;s next work &quot;Clannad&quot;, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on &quot;Clannad&quot; almost immediately after &quot;Air&quot;″s completion. From the start of &quot;Clannad&quot;″s planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in &quot;Air&quot;, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the &#x27;people and the town&#x27;, and &#x27;humanity&#x27;. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in &quot;Clannad&quot;, and equates &quot;Clannad&quot;″s writing process as a &quot;wall that I will never be able to get over again.&quot; While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game&#x27;s story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game&#x27;s base scenario which caused the &#x27;branch&#x27; scenarios to increase as well.

There were more concerns about &quot;Clannad&quot; being similar to &quot;Air&quot;. When Nagisa&#x27;s scenario was being written, there were some disputes concerning the length of her scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how &quot;Air&quot; was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt&#x27;s, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters&#x27; scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game&#x27;s evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa&#x27;s scenario, would eclipse the entire game&#x27;s scenario, much like what happened with &quot;Air&quot; according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in &quot;Clannad&quot;, Maeda focused on making the first half of the story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. &quot;Clannad&quot; is Key&#x27;s second longest work, as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that &quot;Clannad&quot; is about 4,000 words fewer than Key&#x27;s 2008 game &quot;Little Busters! Ecstasy&quot;.

For the anime television adaptation, the first season of &quot;Clannad&quot; received reviews ranging from positive to mixed, while the second season &quot;Clannad After Story&quot; received wide critical acclaim. The THEM Anime Reviews website gave the entire series a score of 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Tim Jones describing the first season as &quot;the most fleshed-out and real Key animated adaption to date,&quot; and reviewer Stig Høgset stating that the second season &quot;After Story&quot; &quot;will play up the tragedies and the drama considerably, quite possibly tearing out your heart in the process. This is where time truly starts to fly by, lending the show some real weight in the emotional departments.&quot;

Theron Martin of Anime News Network gave the first season a &#x27;B+&#x27; rating, criticizing its extensive use of moe elements, but considered it appealing entertainment for a &quot;fan base who revels in this kind of thing.&quot; His review for the second season &quot;After Story&quot; was much more positive, giving it an &#x27;A−&#x27; rating. He praised the second half of the season as &quot;the best-written quarter of &quot;Clannad&quot;,&quot; stating that it &quot;effectively builds up and delivers its emotional appeal, reinforces the series&#x27; central theme (i.e. the importance of family), and peaks visually,&quot; and concluding that &quot;only the most cynical of souls will avoid shedding at least a few tears at certain points.&quot; On the DVD Talk website, the reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. gave &quot;Clannad After Story&quot; a &quot;Highly Recommended&quot; rating, stating that &quot;the range of emotions &quot;Clannad&quot; takes you through is quite daunting. It&#x27;s charming, cute, hilarious, mysterious, and tragic all at the same time. Few shows are as memorable, and few are this good for this long.&quot; He concludes that the storytelling is &quot;heartfelt&quot; and &quot;memorable in so many ways,&quot; and that &quot;few shows rise to the levels this one does.&quot;

===Legacy===
Gamania Entertainment hosted a collaboration event with &quot;Clannad&quot; and their two massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) &quot;Hiten Online&quot; and &quot;Holy Beast Online&quot;. Between March 26 and June 26, 2008, the two games offered costumes characters could wear which looked like the winter school uniforms from &quot;Clannad&quot;, along with offering Kyou&#x27;s pet boar Botan for players to adopt. Players of either game who had a character over level 20 could enter a lottery where 500 people were chosen to win &quot;Clannad&quot;-related goods which included virtual and real-world items such as file folders, &quot;netcash&quot; cards, sports towels, tapestries, and various items used during gameplay.

ASCII Media Works and Vridge produced the PlayStation 2 visual novel based on the light novel series &quot;Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu&quot;. Released in September 2008, the game features the series&#x27; characters cosplaying in various costumes either depicting characters from five popular light novel series published by ASCII Media Works, or three &quot;Clannad&quot; heroines. Haruka Nogizaka can cosplay as Kotomi Ichinose, Mika Nogizaka can cosplay as Nagisa Furukawa (albeit with long hair), and Shiina Amamiya can cosplay as Tomoyo Sakagami. The player can also view exclusive CGs in the game if one of the girls is taken out to various places while cosplaying as one of the aforementioned five light novel series characters, or as the &quot;Clannad&quot; heroines. For example, if Mika is cosplaying as Nagisa, a CG of her eating dango can become viewable. When cosplaying as one of these tie-in characters, the voice of the girl cosplaying changes to the voice actress of the character they are cosplaying; for example, if Shiina cosplays as Tomoyo, she is voiced by Tomoyo&#x27;s voice actress Houko Kuwashima.

A 3D virtual world called &quot;Ai Sp@ce&quot; was developed by the video game developer Headlock where users can interact with bishōjo game heroines from &quot;Clannad&quot;, &quot;Shuffle!&quot;, and &quot;Da Capo II&quot;. Released in October 2008, the world recreates each game franchise on its own virtual island which are linked with a central Akihabara Island where users can interact, bridging the gap between the separate franchises. Users are able to create a customizable avatar to represent themselves in the game, along with choosing one game heroine to live with, which is referred to as a character doll, or chara-doll for short. The user and chara-doll reside together on one of the three in-game &quot;islands&quot; depending on which franchise the heroine is from, which includes a house with furniture and clothes that can be purchased. The chara-dolls can also be customizable in that they can develop a unique personality for each user.

Characters from &quot;Clannad&quot; also appear in the Key crossover series &quot;Kaginado&quot;, which premiered in 2021.

<text>The Playford family has played a significant role in the South Australian and Australian political and social sphere since the early days of European settlement.

*Thomas Playford senior, an ex-soldier who fought at the Battle of Waterloo, a fiery Baptist preacher who arrived in Adelaide c. 1844 and helped found a church called, simply, &quot;The Christian Church&quot;.
*Thomas Playford II served as Premier of South Australia from 1887 to 1889 and 1890 to 1892, as well as a Senator in the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia (a name he coined), including a stint as the Federal Minister for Defence.
*Thomas Playford III was a well-known local farmer and Adelaide identity.
*Thomas Playford IV was Premier of South Australia from 1938 to 1965; the longest serving elected national or regional leader in the British Empire/ Commonwealth of Nations.
*Thomas Playford V is a Baptist minister who ran at the 2002 South Australian state election for the seat of Kavel under the banner of &quot;Independent for Integrity in Parliament&quot;, polling 19%. He ran as a Family First candidate for the same seat at the 2006 election, polling 15% of the vote.
The Playford family heritage can be traced back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child &#x27;Thomas Playford&#x27;. The occupants of the house were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for raising the child. The child grew up to be a farmer, and had a son in 1795 whom he christened &#x27;Thomas Playford&#x27;. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.

The second Playford enlisted in the British Army in 1810, aged 15. Playford&#x27;s height (6 ft 2 in) enabled him to pass as eighteen. He spent 24 years in the Life Guards, fighting all over Europe in Portugal, Spain and France, including the Battle of Waterloo at the age of 20. He left the Life Guards in 1834, received a land grant in Canada for his service, and journeyed there with his wife and family. His wife and a child died in the country, so he and his remaining kin returned to England. He worked as a historian for the Life Guards until 1844 when he migrated to the then-province of South Australia. Playford became a pastor there, built a property at Mitcham, and preached regularly for his own &#x27;Christian Church&#x27;, which was essentially Baptist in character.

The third Playford, Thomas Playford II, was born at Bethnal Green, London, in 1837. He was raised on the Mitcham property in South Australia and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at Norton Summit and growing vegetables, plums and apples. He was elected to the local East Torrens Council in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the State Parliament in 1868, representing the constituency of Onkaparinga. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then spent a great deal of his term absent in India. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as Agent General to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was thrice offered a knighthood, but declined it each time.

He returned to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government, but ultimately crossed the floor to bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen the power of the Legislative Council. With the advent of Australian Federation, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of the Senate and the 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to Kent Town, where he died in 1915, aged 78.

The fourth Playford, father of Sir Thomas, was born in 1861. He became a farmer at the Norton Summit property. He was, like his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, his wife Elizabeth was the local correspondent of &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Thomas Playford IV.
Thomas Playford IV was an Australian politician from the state of South Australia. He served as Premier of South Australia and leader of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) from 5 November 1938 to 10 March 1965. Though controversial, it was the longest term of any elected government leader in Australian history. His tenure as premier was marked by a period of population and economic growth unmatched by any other Australian state. He was known for his parochial style in pushing South Australia&#x27;s interests, and was known for his ability to secure a disproportionate share of federal funding for the state as well as his shameless haranguing of federal leaders. His string of election wins was supported by a system of malapportionment later dubbed erroneously, the &quot;Playmander&quot;.

<doc id="983990" wikidata="Q5633147" url="?curid=983990" title="HMS Liverpool (1814)">
<text>HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was a Royal Navy frigate, reclassified as a fourth rate. She was built by Wigram, Wells and Green and launched at Woolwich on 21 February 1814. She was built of pitch-pine, which made for speedy construction at the expense of durability.

Her major service was on the East Indies Station from where in 1819 she led the successful punitive campaign against the Al Qasimi, a belligerent naval power based in Ras Al Khaimah which the British considered to be piratical. She was sold in 1822 but continued to operate in the Persian Gulf for an indefinite period thereafter.

==Service==

&quot;Liverpool&quot; was commissioned under Captain Arthur Farquhar in May 1814. Her first commission was very brief, though. She escorted convoys to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Quebec. She then served at the Cape Station before returning to Deptford to be paid off on 3 April 1816. First, though, she captured the French schooner
&quot;Circonstance&quot; on 21 October 1815. &quot;Circonstance&quot; was carrying 67 slaves.

On 5 Match 1816, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was driven ashore and severely damaged at Dover, Kent, England. She was later refloated and taken in to The Downs. In 1817 she was laid up at Deptford.

In 1818, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was re-commissioned under Captain Francis Augustus Collier. He sailed her to join the East Indies Station, sailing via Mauritius and Trincomalee. While at Port Louis she captured four slave vessels. In the middle of 1819 she captured &quot;Deux Amis&quot; (29 July), &quot;Constance&quot; (17 August) and &quot;Jenny&quot; (24 August). Bounty money was paid for the freed slaves.

== Persian Gulf campaign of 1819 ==
Rear Admiral King appointed Captain Collier of &quot;Liverpool&quot; to command the naval portion of a joint navy-army punitive expedition against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah in the Persian Gulf. The naval force consisted of &quot;Liverpool&quot;, , , and a number of gun and mortar boats. The Bombay Marine of the East India Company contributed six armed vessels: the 16-gun &quot;Teignmouth&quot; under the command of Captain Hall, the senior captain, the 16-gun &quot;Benares&quot;, the 14-gun , the 14-gun , the 12-gun , and the 12-gun . Later two frigates and 600 men belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined the expedition. On the army side, Major General Sir William Keir commanded some 3,000 troops in transports, including the 47th and 65th Regiments of Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers. In all, 1,645 European and 1,424 Indian soldiers (&#x27;sepoys&#x27;) and marines took part in the expedition.

The fleet anchored off Ras Al Khaimah on 2 December, landing troops two miles south of the town on 3 December. Collier placed Captain Walpole of &quot;Curlew&quot; in charge of the gun boats and an armed pinnace to protect the landing, which was, however, unopposed. The bombardment of the town commenced on 6 December, from landed batteries of 12 pound guns and mortars as well as from sea. On 7 December, two 24-pound cannon from &quot;Liverpool&quot; were added to the land batteries. When the troops stormed the town on 9 December they found that the inhabitants had all fled. The siege cost the British five dead and 52 men wounded. The Al Qasimi reportedly had lost a thousand dead.

On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three ships were sent to blockade the nearby harbour at Rams, to the North. They landed a force on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to the hilltop fort of Dhayah on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire until the two 24-pound cannon from &quot;Liverpool&quot; were once again pressed into use. After enduring two hours of fire from the big guns, which breached the fort&#x27;s walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of the 22nd.

The expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.

The action was to result in the signing of the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, the first treaty between the British and the Sheikhs of what was formerly known as the Pirate Coast and what would become known as the Trucial Coast. The area is known today as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

==Fate==
&quot;Liverpool&quot; carried on serving in the East Indies Station and made a trip to China under Collier. &quot;Liverpool&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf in August 1821, where she lost a number of her crew to the heat. She was paid off at Bombay in January 1822. &quot;Liverpool″&quot;s captain, officers and crew then transferred to the newly built and sailed her back to Spithead, arriving on 6 October 1822.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; was sold at Bombay on 16 April 1822 for £3,780. The buyer apparently was a Persian prince who wanted to use her to suppress piracy in the Persian Gulf.

<text>HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was a fourth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy.

==History==

&quot;Liverpool&quot; was ordered on 31 March 1855, but building did not commence until 14 November 1859 and she was launched at Devonport Dockyard on 30 October 1860, in the same year that the famous iron-hulled was launched.

During her first commission, she served in the North America and West Indies Stations and later the Channel Squadron. In June 1864, she ran aground off Santo Domingo. She was refloated and ordered back to England for repairs. She was placed in &quot;Steam Reserve&quot; at Devonport in August 1867.

Like previous ships of the same name, she was re-commissioned on 8 May 1869 as flagship of the Special Flying Squadron, under Rear Admiral Geoffrey Hornby. The squadron&#x27;s mission was an early form of &quot;flag waving&quot; to display British naval power and prowess across the world. The &quot;Flying Squadron&quot; consisted of HM ships , , , &quot;Liverpool&quot;, , and . The squadron left Portsmouth on 18 July 1869, circumnavigated the globe, and returned in November 1870, having sailed 53,000 miles. &quot;Liverpool&quot; was paid off into reserve in December of the year she returned. She was subsequently declared obsolete in 1872 and was sold for breaking up on 26 June 1875.

<doc id="983998" wikidata="Q1365375" url="?curid=983998" title="Jack Straus">
<text>Jack &quot;Treetop&quot; Straus (June 16, 1930 – August 17, 1988) was an American professional poker player.

He is best known for winning the 1982 World Series of Poker Main Event, where he was able to come back from being down to one chip earlier in the tournament, giving meaning to the poker phrase &quot;a chip and a chair&quot;. In addition, Straus is known for successfully pulling off one of the best bluffs in the history of poker.

==Poker career==
Straus began playing in World Series of Poker events in the early 1970s. He finished in fourth place in the 1972 Main Event. He won his first bracelet in 1973 in the $3,000 Deuce to Seven Draw event for $16,500. Straus finished in third place in the Main Event that year. He won the 1982 World Series of Poker Main Event, earning $520,000 and a second WSOP bracelet. Straus&#x27; appearances at the final table of the Main Event in 1972, 1973, and 1982 put him in an elite group of players to have made the final table three or more times. Other players to have accomplished this include Main Event champions such as Johnny Moss, Doyle Brunson, Stu Ungar, Johnny Chan and Dan Harrington.

==1982 WSOP Main Event, &quot;A Chip and a Chair&quot;==
Famously, Straus&#x27;s 1982 win was a comeback after being down to a single $500 chip, supposedly the origin of the common tournament poker aphorism: &quot;a chip and a chair.&quot; Although accounts vary, the most common story is that he pushed his chips into the pot, was called and lost the hand. Straus had thought he was eliminated from the tournament, but when he got up, he discovered he had one chip left under a napkin on the table.

Because he did not declare himself all-in, the tournament directors allowed him to continue playing. Modern lore says that this feat occurred at the final table, but the 2005 book &quot;All In&quot;, which documents the history of the WSOP, confirms that it occurred early in the second day, and did leave him with a $500 chip before his comeback.

==The bluff==
Straus is credited with one of the most celebrated bluffs of all time. While playing in a high-stakes no limit Texas Hold&#x27;em cash game, Straus had won several large pots in a row and so decided that he would raise the next hand pre-flop with any two cards. When he looked down he found that he had been dealt 7–2 offsuit, the worst starting hand in Texas Hold&#x27;em, but, playing a &#x27;rush&#x27;, he raised anyway. Straus&#x27;s raise was called by a single opponent and the flop came 7–3–3. This was a good flop for a 7–2, so Straus bet out. However his tight opponent made a large raise, indicating a likely overpair to the board.

Straus knew he was almost certainly behind, but he decided that he might be able to beat his opponent by representing trip threes, so he called the large raise. The turn was a 2, for a board of 7–3–3–2, which was no help to Straus with a better pair already on the board, but he made a huge bet anyway. This set his opponent thinking deeply. Straus knew that he was desperate to avoid a call, as his chances of drawing out to win on the river were very slim. After a few minutes, Straus offered his opponent a proposition. He told him that for $25, he could choose either one of Straus&#x27;s hole cards and Straus would show it to him. The opponent considered for a while, then tossed Straus $25 and chose a card. Straus showed him the deuce.

After another long pause, his opponent eventually figured that Straus would only make such an offer if both of his hole-cards were deuces, therefore giving him a full house: deuces over threes. He reluctantly folded, and Jack Straus entered poker folklore as one of the most creative bluffers of all time. The bluff was depicted in the Stu Ungar biopic &quot;Stuey&quot;; however, Straus is not a character in the film and the bluff is credited to another player.

==Outside poker==
Straus was nicknamed &quot;Treetop&quot; because he was 6&#x27;6&quot;; he attended Texas A&amp;M. While it has been reported that he had played varsity basketball there, his name does not appear on the school&#x27;s all-time list of basketball letter earners. Aside from his poker-playing, Straus was well known as a marksman, a big-game hunter, and for his erudite wit.

==Death==
After his championship win, Straus continued to actively play poker until his death.

He died of an aortic aneurysm on August 17, 1988, at the age of 58 while playing in a high-stakes poker game at the Bicycle Casino in Los Angeles. He was posthumously inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame later that year.

Straus&#x27;s live poker tournament winnings exceeded $750,000.

<text>In neuroanatomy, the postcentral gyrus is a prominent gyrus in the lateral parietal lobe of the human brain. It is the location of the primary somatosensory cortex, the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch. Like other sensory areas, there is a map of sensory space in this location, called the &quot;sensory homunculus&quot;.

The primary somatosensory cortex was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of Wilder Penfield, and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2, more recent work by Kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as &quot;primary somatosensory cortex&quot;, as it receives the bulk of the thalamocortical projections from the sensory input fields.

==Structure==
The lateral postcentral gyrus is bounded by:
*medial longitudinal fissure medially (to the middle)
*central sulcus rostrally (in front)
*postcentral sulcus caudally (in back)
*lateral sulcus inferiorly (underneath)

The postcentral gyrus includes Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3. Brodmann area 1 occupies the apex of the postcentral gyrus.

<text>Britton Hill is the highest natural point in the state of Florida, United States, with a summit elevation of above mean sea level. Britton Hill is the lowest state highpoint in the United States, lower than the next lowest highpoint, Ebright Azimuth in Delaware, and far lower than many skyscrapers in Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando. In comparison, Miami&#x27;s Panorama Tower skyscraper reaches to above mean sea level.

The hill is located in northern Walton County near the town of Lakewood, Florida, just off County Road 285 about southeast of Florala, Alabama. It is inside Lakewood Park, which marks the high point and features a monument, trails, and an information board.

<doc id="984017" wikidata="Q3531586" url="?curid=984017" title="Toni Skarica">
<text>Antonio Peter &quot;Toni&quot; Skarica is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2000 who represented the Hamilton area ridings of Wentworth North and Wentworth—Burlington. In 2012 he was appointed as a judge to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

==Background==
Skarica was born in England. Miroslav, his father was of Bosnian heritage while his mother, Hilda, came from Austria. The family moved to Canada when Skarica was five years old. He has a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McMaster University, and a law degree from the University of Toronto. He was called to the bar in 1979 and worked in private practice and as a Crown attorney. He is married with two children.

==Politics==
Skarica was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Chris Ward and New Democratic Party incumbent Don Abel by a significant margin in the suburban Hamilton riding of Wentworth North. He was not appointed to cabinet under Mike Harris, and soon developed a reputation as a maverick within his party. He opposed school board amalgamation and told regional officials to refuse payment of social housing costs being downloaded by the province. He also opposed the Harris government&#x27;s plans to amalgamate the City of Hamilton with neighbouring municipalities.

Skarica was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, in the redistributed riding of Wentworth—Burlington. During the election, he promised to resign if he was unable to prevent the amalgamation of Ancaster, Dundas and Flamborough into the City of Hamilton. The Harris government pushed forward with its amalgamation plans at the end of 1999, and Skarica resigned from the legislature on February 7, 2000.

==Later life ==
After leaving office, Skarica went back to work as assistant Crown attorney serving Hamilton, Ontario. On November 1, 2012, he was appointed as a judge to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

<doc id="984020" wikidata="Q1753580" url="?curid=984020" title="What the Bleep Do We Know!?">
<text>What the Bleep Do We Know!? (stylized as What tнē #$*! D̄ө ωΣ (k)πow!? and What the #$*! Do We Know!?) is a 2004 American pseudo-scientific film that posits a spiritual connection between quantum physics and consciousness (as part of a belief system known as quantum mysticism). The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer, using documentary-style interviews and computer-animated graphics, as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the creators to illustrate the film&#x27;s scientifically unsupported ideas.

&quot;Bleep&quot; was conceived and its production funded by William Arntz, who serves as co-director along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of Ramtha&#x27;s School of Enlightenment. A moderately low-budget independent film, it was promoted using viral marketing methods and opened in art-house theaters in the western United States, winning several independent film awards before being picked up by a major distributor and eventually grossing over $10 million. The 2004 theatrical release was succeeded by a substantially changed, extended home media version in 2006.

The film has been described as an example of quantum mysticism, and has been criticized for both misrepresenting science and containing pseudoscience. While many of its interviewees and subjects are professional scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology, one of them has noted that the film quotes him out of context.

==Synopsis==
Filmed in Portland, Oregon, &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; presents a viewpoint of the physical universe and human life within it, with connections to neuroscience and quantum physics. Some ideas discussed in the film are:
* That the universe is best seen as constructed from thoughts and ideas rather than from matter.
* That &quot;empty space&quot; is not empty.
* That matter is not solid, and electrons are able to pop in and out of existence without it being known where they disappear to.
* That beliefs about who one is and what is real are a direct cause of oneself and of one&#x27;s own realities.
* That peptides produced by the brain can cause a bodily reaction to emotion.

In the narrative segments of the film, Marlee Matlin portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of everywoman as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives.

In the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda&#x27;s experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: &quot;We create our own reality.&quot; The director, William Arntz, has described &quot;What the Bleep&quot; as a film for the &quot;metaphysical left&quot;.

==Cast==
* Marlee Matlin as Amanda
* Elaine Hendrix as Jennifer
* Barry Newman as Frank
* Robert Bailey Jr. as Reggie
* John Ross Bowie as Elliot
* Armin Shimerman as Man
* Robert Blanche as Bob
* Larry Brandenburg as Bruno
* Patti B. Collins as Mother of the Bride

==Production==
Work was split between Toronto-based Mr. X Inc., Lost Boys Studios in Vancouver, and Atomic Visual Effects in Cape Town, South Africa. The visual-effects team, led by Evan Jacobs, worked closely with the other film-makers to create visual metaphors that would capture the essence of the film&#x27;s technical subjects with attention to aesthetic detail.

==Release==
===Promotion===
Lacking the funding and resources of the typical Hollywood film, the filmmakers relied on &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot; first to get the film into theaters, and then to attract audiences. This has led to accusations, both formal and informal, directed towards the film&#x27;s proponents, of spamming online message boards and forums with many thinly veiled promotional posts. Initially, the film was released in only two theaters: one in Yelm, Washington (the home of the producers, which is also the home of Ramtha), and the other the Bagdad Theater in Portland, Oregon, where it was filmed. Within several weeks, the film had appeared in a dozen or more theaters (mostly in the western United States), and within six months it had made its way into 200 theaters across the US.

===Box office===
According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the film was one of the sleeper hits of 2004, as &quot;word-of-mouth and strategic marketing kept it in theaters for an entire year.&quot; The article states that the domestic gross exceeded $10 million, described as not bad for a low-budget documentary, and that the DVD release attained even more significant success with over a million units shipped in the first six months following its release in March 2005. Foreign gross added another $5 million for a worldwide gross of just over $21 million.

===Critical response===
In the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; article, publicist Linda Rienecker of &quot;New Page Books&quot; says that she sees the success as part of a wider phenomenon, stating &quot;A large part of the population is seeking spiritual connections, and they have the whole world to choose from now&quot;. Author Barrie Dolnick adds that &quot;people don&#x27;t want to learn how to do one thing. They&#x27;ll take a little bit of Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology... They&#x27;re coming into the marketplace hungry for direction, but they don&#x27;t want some person who claims to have all the answers. They want suggestions, not formulas.&quot; The same article quotes Bill Pfau, Advertising Manager of Inner Traditions, as saying &quot;More and more ideas from the New Age community have become accepted into the mainstream.&quot;

Critics offered mixed reviews as seen on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, where it scored a &quot;Rotten&quot; 34% score with an average score of 4.6/10, based on 77 reviews. In his review, Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the &quot;transition from quantum mechanics to cognitive therapy&quot; as &quot;plausible&quot;, but stated also that &quot;the subsequent leap—from cognitive therapy into large, hazy spiritual beliefs—isn&#x27;t as effectively executed. Suddenly people who were talking about subatomic particles are alluding to alternate universes and cosmic forces, all of which can be harnessed in the interest of making Ms. Matlin&#x27;s character feel better about her thighs.&quot;

&quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; has been described as &quot;a kind of New Age answer to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and other films that adhere to traditional religious teachings.&quot; It offers alternative spirituality views characteristic of New Age philosophy, including critiques of the competing claims of stewardship among traditional religions [viz., institutional Judaism, Christianity, and Islam] of universally recognized and accepted moral values.

===Academic reaction===
Scientists who have reviewed &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; have described distinct assertions made as pseudoscience. Lisa Randall refers to the film as &quot;the bane of scientists&quot;. Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that water molecules can be influenced by thought (as popularized by Masaru Emoto), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates of a city, and that quantum physics implies that &quot;consciousness is the ground of all being.&quot; The film was also discussed in a letter published in &quot;Physics Today&quot; that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to &quot;expose the mysteries physics has encountered [and] reveal the limits of our understanding&quot;. In the letter, the authors write: &quot;the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum &#x27;insights&#x27; that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense.&quot; It went on to say that &quot;Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided,&quot; and that &quot;a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics,&quot; a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which &quot;we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered&quot;.

Richard Dawkins stated that &quot;the authors seem undecided whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs none of the hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us&quot;, concluding that the film is &quot;tosh&quot;. Professor Clive Greated wrote that &quot;thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message&quot;. Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the film, stating: &quot;I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK as it has in the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing.&quot; Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion &quot;that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics&quot; was &quot;ridiculous balderdash&quot;. According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society&#x27;s review criticizes the film as a &quot;pseudoscientific docudrama&quot;, saying &quot;Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.&quot;

Bernie Hobbs, a science writer with ABC Science Online, explains why the film is incorrect about quantum physics and reality: &quot;The observer effect of quantum physics isn&#x27;t about people or reality. It comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and it&#x27;s about the limitations of trying to measure the position and momentum of subatomic particles... this only applies to sub-atomic particles—a rock doesn&#x27;t need you to bump into it to exist. It&#x27;s there. The sub-atomic particles that make up the atoms that make up the rock are there too.&quot; Hobbs also discusses Hagelin&#x27;s experiment with Transcendental Meditation and the Washington DC rate of violent crime, saying that &quot;the number of murders actually went up&quot;. Hobbs further disputed the film&#x27;s use of the ten percent of the brain myth.

David Albert, a philosopher of physics who appears in the film, has accused the filmmakers of selectively editing his interview to make it appear that he endorses the film&#x27;s thesis that quantum mechanics is linked with consciousness. He says he is &quot;profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness&quot;.

In the film, during a discussion of the influence of experience on perception, Candace Pert gives an apocryphal version of the invisible ships myth whereby Native Americans were unable to see Columbus&#x27;s ships because they were outside the natives&#x27; experience. According to an article in &quot;Fortean Times&quot; by David Hambling, the origins of this story likely involved the voyages of Captain James Cook, not Columbus, and an account related by Robert Hughes which said Cook&#x27;s ships were &quot;...complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives&#x27; understanding&quot;. Hambling says it is likely that both the Hughes account and the story told by Pert were exaggerations of the records left by Captain Cook and the botanist Joseph Banks.

Skeptic James Randi described the film as &quot;a fantasy docudrama&quot; and &quot;[a] rampant example of abuse by charlatans and cults&quot;. Eric Scerri in a review for Committee for Skeptical Inquiry dismisses it as &quot;a hodgepodge of all kinds of crackpot nonsense,&quot; where &quot;science [is] distorted and sensationalized&quot;. A BBC reviewer described it as &quot;a documentary aimed at the totally gullible&quot;.

According to Margaret Wertheim, &quot;History abounds with religious enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into the arrangement of the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism.&quot; Wertheim continues that the film &quot;abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film&#x27;s characters gushes early in the proceedings, &#x27;The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened&#x27;. A moment in which &#x27;the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums&#x27;.&quot;

Journalist John Gorenfeld, writing in &quot;Salon&quot;, notes that the film&#x27;s three directors, William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente, were at the time students of Ramtha&#x27;s School of Enlightenment, which he says has been described as a cult. Mark Vicente later became involved with another prominent cult: NXIVM, the human-potential-development and sex-trafficking pyramid scheme founded by convicted con artist Keith Raniere. After leaving NXIVM, Vicente participated in the exposé documentary series &quot;The Vow&quot;, revealing many of the cult&#x27;s damaging tactics; however, nowhere in &quot;The Vow&quot; does Vicente admit that NXIVM was not his first time adhering to a cult-like group.

==Legacy==
In mid-2005, the filmmakers worked with HCI Books to expand on the themes in a book titled &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?—Discovering the Endless Possibilities of Your Everyday Reality&quot;. HCI president Peter Vegso stated that in regard to this book, &quot;What the Bleep is the quantum leap in the New Age world,&quot; and &quot;by marrying science and spirituality, it is the foundation of future thought.&quot;

On August 1, 2006, &quot;What the Bleep! Down the Rabbit Hole - Quantum Edition&quot; multi-disc DVD set was released, containing two extended versions of &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?,&quot; with over 15 hours of material on three double-sided DVDs.

<doc id="984021" wikidata="Q27970" url="?curid=984021" title="Yupik languages">
<text>The Yupik languages () are a family of languages spoken by the Yupik peoples of western and south-central Alaska and Chukotka. The Yupik languages differ enough from one another that they are not mutually intelligible, although speakers of one of the languages may understand the general idea of a conversation of speakers of another of the languages. One of them, Sirenik, has been extinct since 1997.

The Yupik languages are in the family of Eskaleut languages. The Aleut and Proto-Eskimoan diverged around 2000 BCE; within the Proto-Eskimoan classification, the Yupik languages diverged from each other and from the Inuit languages around 1000 CE.

==List of languages==
#Naukan Yupik (also Naukanski): spoken by perhaps 100 people in and around Lavrentiya, Lorino, and Uelen on the Chukotka Peninsula of Eastern Siberia.
#Central Siberian Yupik (also Yupigestun, Akuzipigestun, Akuzipik, Siberian Yupik, Siberian Yupik Eskimo, Central Siberian Yupik Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Yuit, Asiatic Eskimo, Jupigyt, Yupihyt, Bering Strait Yupik): spoken by the majority of Yupik in the Russian Far East and by the people on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Most of the 1,100 Yupiks on St. Lawrence Island still speak the St. Lawrence dialect of this language. About 200 of the 1,200 Siberian Yupiks in Russia still speak the Chaplino dialect of this language. However, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; is much more pessimistic, claiming that in 2023 only one Central Siberian Yupik active speaker remains in Russia.
#Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik (also Yugtun, Central Yup&#x27;ik, Yup&#x27;ik, West Alaska Eskimo): spoken on the Alaska mainland from Norton Sound down to the Alaska Peninsula and on some islands such as Nunivak. The name of this language is spelled &quot;Yup&#x27;ik&quot;, with an apostrophe that specifies the elongated &#x27;p&#x27; in the way &quot;Yupik&quot; is pronounced; all the other languages are spelled &quot;Yupik&quot;, but all are pronounced the same. Of the about 21,000 Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik, around 20,000 still spoke this language at home in 2013. There are several dialects of Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik. The largest dialect, General Central Yup&#x27;ik or &quot;Yugtun&quot;, is spoken in the Yukon River, Nelson Island, Kuskokwim River, and Bristol Bay areas. There are three other Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik dialects: Norton Sound, Hooper Bay/Chevak, and Nunivak Island (called &quot;Cup’ik&quot; or &quot;Cup&#x27;ig&quot;). The dialects differ in pronunciation and in vocabulary. Within the General Central Yup&#x27;ik dialect there are geographic subdialects which differ mostly in word choices.
#Alutiiq (also Alutiit’stun or Sugt&#x27;stun, Supik, Sugpiaq, Pacific Gulf Yupik, Pacific Yupik, or Chugach): is spoken from the Alaska Peninsula eastward to Prince William Sound. There are about 3,000 Alutiiqs, but only 500–1,000 people still speak this language. The Koniag dialect is spoken on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula and on Kodiak Island. The Chugach dialect is spoken on the Kenai Peninsula and in Prince William Sound.
#Sirenik an extinct language formerly spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula. It is divergent enough for some researchers to classify it as a separate branch of the Eskimo languages.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Central Yup&#x27;ik Consonants:

c ~, g , gg , k, l , ll , m, ḿ (&quot;voiceless&quot; m), n (&quot;alveolar&quot;), ń (&quot;voiceless&quot; n), ng , ńg (&quot;voiceless&quot; ŋ), p, q , r , rr , s , ss , t (&quot;alveolar&quot;), û , v ~, vv , w , y , (&quot;gemination of preceding consonant&quot;)

=== Vowels ===
Yupik languages have four vowels: &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;u&#x27; and schwa (ə). They have from 13 to 27 consonants.

Central Yup&#x27;ik Vowels:

a, aa, e (ə) (&quot;schwa&quot;), i, ii, u, uu

(In proximity to the uvular consonants &#x27;q&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27; or &#x27;rr&#x27;, the vowel is pronounced , and is pronounced .)

===Prosody===
==== Syllable ====
Yup&#x27;ik verbs always begin with a root morpheme like &quot;kaig&quot; - to be hungry, and always end with a pronoun.

Yupik is a polysynthetic language that can have analytic alternatives; speakers can express similar ideas in a series of words with a number of bound morphemes.

====Stress====
The stress pattern of Central Siberian and Central Alaskan is generally iambic where stress occurs on the second syllable of each two-syllable metrical foot. This can be seen in words consisting of light (L) syllables. Here, the parsing of syllables into feet is represented with parentheses:

As can be seen above, the footing of a Yupik word starts from the left edge of the word. (Therefore, a foot parsing of &quot;L(L&#x27;L)(L&#x27;L)&quot; is not permitted.) Syllables that cannot be parsed into feet in words with an odd number of syllables are not stressed. (Thus, a parsing of &quot;(L&#x27;L)(&#x27;L)&quot; is impossible.)

Additionally, heavy (H) syllables (consisting of two moras) are obligatorily stressed:

However, there is a restriction against stress falling on the final syllable of a phrase:

: (L&#x27;L)(L&#x27;L) (phrase-internal)
: (L&#x27;L)LL (phrase-final)

Stressed syllables undergo phonetic lengthening in Yupik although the details differ from dialect to dialect. Generally, a foot consisting of light CV syllables will have the stressed vowel at a greater length than the unstressed vowel. That can be analyzed as light syllables changing to heavy under stress:

Both Central Siberian and Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik show this iambic lengthening of light syllables.

When the stressed syllable is underlyingly heavy (such as &quot;LHL)&quot;), there is dialectal variation. The Chaplinski variety of Central Siberian Yupik shows no extra lengthening of the already long vowel: the heavy syllables remain heavy (no change). The St. Lawrence variety of Central Siberian Yupik has further iambic overlengthening, resulting in a change from underlying heavy to a phonetically superheavy syllable (S). In those cases, Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik changes the first light syllable in what would be a (LH) foot to a heavy syllable which then receives stress. The light to heavy shift is realized as consonant gemination (of the onset) in CV syllables and as consonantal lengthening of the coda in CVC syllables:

Note that in the Chaplinski variety because of iambic lengthening there is a neutralization of vowel length contrast in nonfinal stressed syllables.

==Morphology==
The Yupik languages, like other Eskimo–Aleut languages, represent a particular type of agglutinative language called an &quot;affixally polysynthetic language&quot;.

Yupik languages &quot;synthesize&quot; a single root at the beginning of every word with various grammatical suffixes to create long words with sentence-like meanings. Within the vocabulary of Yupik there are lexical roots and suffixes that can be combined to create meanings that in most languages are expressed by multiple free morphemes.

Although every Yupik word contains &quot;one and only one root&quot; that is rigidly constrained to word-initial position, the ordering of the suffixes that follow can be varied to communicate different meanings, principally through recursion. The only exception lies with case suffixes on nouns and person suffixes on verbs, which are restricted to the end of the words in which they occur.

Yupik is an ergative language both in nominal and verbal morphology. It has obligatory polyagreement on all verbs with subject and object but not with the theme of a ditransitive verb.

== Writing systems ==
The Yupik languages were not written until the arrival of Europeans around the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest efforts at writing Yupik were those of missionaries who, with their Yupik-speaking assistants, translated the Bible and other religious texts into Yupik. Such efforts as those of Saint Innocent of Alaska, Reverend John Hinz (see John Henry Kilbuck) and Uyaquq had the limited goals of transmitting religious beliefs in written form.

In addition to the Alaskan Iñupiat, the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted a Latin alphabet originally developed by Moravian missionaries in Greenland beginning in the 1760s, which the missionaries later transported to Labrador. 

After the United States purchased Alaska, Yupik children were taught to write English with Latin letters in the public schools. Some were also taught the Yupik script developed by Rev. Hinz, which used Latin letters, which had become the most widespread method for writing Yupik. In Russia, most Yupik were taught to read and write only Russian, but a few scholars wrote Yupik using Cyrillic letters.

In the 1960s, the University of Alaska assembled a group of scholars and native Yupik speakers who developed a script to replace the Hinz writing system. One of the goals of this script was that it could be input from an English keyboard without diacritics or extra letters. Another requirement was that it accurately represent each phoneme in the language with a distinct letter. A few features of the script are that it uses &#x27;q&#x27; for the back version of &#x27;k&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27; for the Yupik sound that resembles the French &#x27;r&#x27;, and consonant + &#x27; for a geminated (lengthened) consonant. The rhythmic doubling of vowels (except schwa) in every second consecutive open syllable is not indicated in the orthography unless it comes at the end of a word.

<doc id="984025" wikidata="Q80332" url="?curid=984025" title="Michael Tien">
<text>Michael Tien Puk-sun (; born 26 August 1950) is a Hong Kong politician, businessman and member of the Legislative Council for New Territories North West. He is the founder and chairman of the G2000 and U2 Clothing retail chains and former chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC). He was formerly a member of the Liberal Party, which was led by his elder brother, James Tien, and a member of the New People&#x27;s Party.

==History==
Tien was appointed as the chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) in December 2001 amid public criticism on his predecessor, K. Y. Yeung. He proposed and implemented administrative reforms that enhanced KCRC&#x27;s transparency and accountability; he regularly attended Legco meeting and explained the company&#x27;s policies and decisions. In 2006, Tien resigned as chairman of the KCRC due to disputes with other directors over his management style.

Tien joined the Liberal Party in 2008 and became District Officer for Kowloon West. He quit the party in 2010 and started the New People&#x27;s Party with Regina Ip, of which he became the deputy chairman.

In the 2017 Chief Executive election, Tien supported his party chairwoman Regina Ip. He complained the election had &quot;lost its shape&quot; due to the increasing interference of &quot;an invisible hand&quot;, referring to the Liaison Office. Tien inclined his support for John Tsang after Ip dropped out, although Ip endorsed Carrie Lam on the last day before the election. Tien eventually quit the party on 10 April with six District Councillors.

In the 2019 District Council elections, Tien lost his Tsuen Wan District Council seat following a rout of pro-Beijing candidates amidst the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. 

In December 2021, it was reported that Tien was eligible to vote four times in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, yielding 0.0328896% of the total voting value (elected seats), which is 6618 times more than the value of an average voter&#x27;s total voting value.

==Background and education==
Tien attended Diocesan Boys&#x27; School and spent a year at Worcester Academy in the United States. Tien has a degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

== Property ownership ==
According to Tien&#x27;s January 2022 declaration of assets, he owns property in Hong Kong, mainland China, and the United States.

<text>A video server is a computer-based device that is dedicated to delivering video. Video servers are used in a number of applications, and often have additional functions and capabilities that address the needs of particular applications. For example, video servers used in security, surveillance and inspection applications typically are designed to capture video from one or more cameras and deliver the video via a computer network. In video production and broadcast applications, a video server may have the ability to record and play recorded video, and to deliver many video streams simultaneously.

==Video broadcast and production==

In TV broadcast industries, a server is a device used to store broadcast quality images and allows several users to edit stories using the images they contain simultaneously.

The video server can be used in a number of contexts, some of which include:

* News: providing short news video clips as part of a news broadcast as seen on networks such as CNN, Fox News and the BBC.
* Production: enhance live events with instant replays and slow motion and highlights (sport production) (see OB Vans)
* Instruction: delivering course material in video format.
* Public Access: delivering city specific information to residents over a cable system.
* Surveillance: deliver real-time video images of protected site.
* Entertainment: deliver anything used for entertainment. It can be gaming, news, movie trailers, or movies.

A professional-grade video server performs recording, storage, and playout of multiple video streams without any degradation of the video signal. Broadcast quality video servers often store hundreds of hours of compressed audio and video (in different codecs), play out multiple and synchronised simultaneous streams of video by, and offer quality interfaces such as SDI for digital video and XLR for balanced analog audio, AES/EBU digital audio and also Time Code. A genlock input is usually provided to provide a means of synchronizing with the house reference clock, thereby avoiding the need for timebase correction or frame synchronizers.

Video servers usually offer some type of control interface allowing them to be driven by broadcast automation systems that incorporate sophisticated broadcast programming applications. Popular protocols include VDCP and the 9-Pin Protocol.

They can optionally allow direct to disk recording using the same codec that is used in various post-production video editing software packages to prevent any wasted time in transcoding.

=== Features ===

Typically, a video server can do the following:

* Ingest of different sources : video cameras (multiple angles), satellite data feeds, disk drives and other video servers. This can be done in different codecs.
* Temporary or definitive storage of these video feeds.
* Maintain a clear structure of all stored media with appropriate metadata to allow fast search : name, remarks, rating, date, time code, etc.
* video editing of the different clips
* Transfer those clips to other video servers or playout directly (via IP interface or SDI)
Generally, they have several bi directional channels (record and ingest) for video and audio. A perfect synchronisation is necessary between those channels to manage the feeds.

==Video surveillance and inspection==
In some surveillance and inspection applications, IP video servers are employed which convert analog video signals into IP video streams. These IP video servers can stream digitized video over IP networks in the same way that an IP camera can. Because an IP Video server uses IP protocols, it can stream video over any IP-compatible network, including via a modem for access over a phone or ISDN connection. With the use of a video server attached to an analog camera, the video from an existing surveillance system can be converted and networked into a new IP surveillance system.

In the video security industry a video server is a device to which one or more video sources can be attached. Video servers are used to give existing analog systems network connectivity. Video servers are essentially transmission/ telemetry / monitoring devices. Viewing is done using a web browser or in some cases supplied software. These products also allow the upload of images to the internet or direct viewing from the internet. In order to upload to the internet an account with an ISP (internet service provider) may be required.

Phone apps that send direct security video feed to smartphones from security video servers are another recent security video server application innovation. This allows smartphone users to view security video server feed from anywhere they can use their smartphone.

<text>Oak Orchard Creek (sometimes called Oak Orchard River) is a tributary of Lake Ontario in Orleans County, New York in the United States.

The creek flows through Oak Orchard Creek Marsh, of which were declared a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. The marshlands through which Oak Orchard Creek flows are a major stopover points for migratory birds, and are protected by state- and federally-designated conservation areas.

==Course==

Oak Orchard Creek rises south of Oak Orchard Creek Marsh (also called the &quot;Alabama Swamp&quot;) at the border of Orleans and Genesee counties. The swamp contains a state reserve, Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area, and a national reserve, the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, both of which are known as major stopover points for migratory birds. Oak Orchard Creek Marsh was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. The swamp is a result of a partial blockage of the river by glacial drift and an outcrop of limestone and dolomite known as the Lockport Formation which forms the Niagara Escarpment.
After flowing through the swamp, it flows northward, across the escarpment in a series of waterfalls and rapids at Shelby Center, thence passing through the Village of Medina to the small Glenwood Lake north of the village. The creek departs the town of Ridgeway at its northeast corner, cuts through the northwest corner of the town of Gaines, and widens before entering the town of Carlton. The widest part is now known as Waterport Pond (Lake Alice), and the hamlet of Waterport is on the south bank. A dam at the northeast end of the pond controls water flow.

Oak Orchard Creek narrows again and passes underneath Route 18 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway before entering Lake Ontario at Point Breeze where Oak Orchard State Marine Park is located. The lower part of the creek remains relatively ice-free during winters presumably due to steady flow of water and hydro-plant at Waterport.

==Sporting activities==

===Boating=== 
Several boat launch locations exist in the lower Oak Orchard Creek. Two are near Point Breeze at the state park. Three more are near the Route 18 overpass. Boating is limited to a short distance upstream from a point called Toms Landing due to the shallow depth. Most boaters enter the creek in order to fish.

There is some concern about pollutants from anti-fouling paint on boat hulls.

===Fishing===
The state fish hatcheries release brown trout, salmon and steelhead each year into the river. Fishing may be done from boats in the lower part, by wading in the upper parts, and from the shore along its length.

===Other activities===
The entire area of public lands is open for birdwatching and hiking. Within the Oak Orchard Swamp other activities, such as hunting and trapping, can be done by permit. Boating is restricted to non-powered boats, and picnicking and camping are restricted to specific areas.

<text>Albert Cheng Jinghan (born 3 July 1946) is a professional engineerer, Hong Kong current affair commentator, businessman, politician and a Fellow of The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, past chairman and present Director of the Aircraft Division. He was appointed by HKSAR Government as Justice of the Peace (JP) in 2007 and he is awarded Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) in 2010. He was named as one of the Time&#x27;s 25 Most Influential Person in 1997 Hong Kong by Times Magazine and he also named as one of 50 Asia Star in 1998 by Newsweek Magazine. He is now residing in Canada.

== Early life and activities in Canada ==
Cheng has family roots from Chaozhou, Guangdong. He born in Hong Kong and received his education in Hong Kong. Starting as an aircraft maintenance apprentice, he subsequently qualified as an aircraft maintenance engineer in Canada in 1969. He became a Canadian citizen four years later.

He was a delegate to the First Chinese Canadian National Conference in 1975. The same year, he served as secretary to the Immigration Policy Action Committee and co-chairman of the National Committee to Save Chinese Barbeque Products. In 1976, he became a founding member of the Vancouver Chinese Cultural Centre. Cheng coordinated a series of cultural activities in the 1970s, including the Chinatown events for the United Nations&#x27; Habitat Vancouver Festival and the Shanghai Ballet national tour in Canada under the auspices of the Canada Council led by the Secretary of State of the federal government. From 1977 to 1979, he was a board member of the Vancouver Strathcona Community Center. He is the founding president of the Chinese Canadian Association of Hong Kong, which was established in 1988. Cheng was granted the Vancouver Community Award in 1978 in recognition of his cultural integrity and contribution especially to the Canadian Chinese community.

Cheng is the founder and founding president of the Chinese Canadian Association in Hong Kong.

== Entrepreneurship ==
In 1981, Cheng left the aviation industry and became an independent market consultant. In 1983, Cheng was lured by the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings, Sally Aw Sian, to return to Hong Kong to spearhead the Group&#x27;s advertising, marketing and business development initiatives. He left the company in 1985.

After consulting for a Sino-Canadian joint venture on the tender for a Light Rail Transit system project, Cheng established Capital Communications Corporation in 1986 to publish the Chinese editions of international titles, such as the &quot;Capital&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot; magazines, Chinese edition. The company was merged with Paramount Publishing Group in 1991 (a public listed company) to become the largest publishing and printing house in the region. In 1991, Capital Communications Corporation was acquired by Paramount Publishing Group, with Cheng becoming CEO, a position he held until 1994. His entrepreneurship earned him the nickname &quot;Taipan&quot;.

Cheng was appointed as consultant for a wide spectrum of key institutions in Hong Kong, including the Land Development Council, Mass Transit Railway Corporation, Hong Kong Jockey Club, Trade Development Council, PCCW, Futures and Security Commission and Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Cheng was a board member of the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulation (HKABC). He also served as board member, treasurer, chairman of the Society of Hong Kong Publishers from 1988 to 1990. He has been served as a trustee of the Foundation of Businesses in Support of the Arts since 1990.

He was a member of the Securities &amp; Futures Commission&#x27;s Public Shareholders Group. Cheng also led the Hong Kong Expo&#x27; 97 Initiative Committee in 1988.

In 1999, Cheng took advantage of the dot-com boom to set up 36.com Holdings Ltd. 36.com later ventured into publishing the weekly Cup magazine. Cheng remains publisher emeritus of the now monthly &quot;Cup&quot; magazine.

== Political activism ==
In May 1989, over a million Hong Kongers took to the streets to rally for the pro-democracy student movement in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic Patriotic Movements of China was established during the massive protests. Cheng is a co-founder of this multi-sectorial umbrella civil body to back the Chinese students&#x27; demand for democracy and a clean government.

The peaceful demonstrations in Tiananmen Square ended in a bloody military crackdown, which shook Hong Kong and the world. Cheng then went on to form the Right of Abode Delegation, with Hong Kong leading businessmen to press London for full British passports for Hong Kong people as a political insurance policy. The campaign resulted in right of abode in Britain for some 50,000 Hong Kong people. 

As an activist, he was instrumental in mobilising mass opposition in 2002 to the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Project, which was regarded as environmental-unfriendly and a threat to Hong Kong&#x27;s renown Victoria Harbor. He was behind a judicial review that resulted in stopping the reclamation in Central.

== Media personality ==
In 1994, Cheng co-hosted the ground-breaking political talk show &quot;News Tease&quot; on Asia Television which set the trend of current affairs commentary programmes in the local electronic media. He was under pressure to leave the business sector because of his candid political remarks. Apart from ATV, he also hosted current affairs talk shows on Cable TV and Now TV.

A year later, he left Paramount Publishing Group and Capital Communications to become a full-time host of Commercial Radio&#x27;s breakfast talk-back show &quot;Teacup in a Storm&quot;. He spoke for the social underdogs and pressed the authorities into action on matters of public concern.

In addition despite his absence from Canada, Cheng has doubled up as a commentator for Overseas Chinese Voice (AM 1320 CHMB), a multicultural radio station in Vancouver. His commentaries were syndicated across overseas Chinese-speaking communities in North America and Australia. He ended his radio show on AM1320 on 30 August 2019.

In print, Cheng had been a columnist for the &quot;Ming Pao Weekly&quot;, &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal&quot; and &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; since 1999.

=== 1998 assault ===
On 19 August 1998, Cheng was ambushed by two knife-wielding assailants and sustained serious injuries outside the radio station before he was scheduled to air. He was struck on his back, arms and right leg for a total of six times, leaving deep wounds up to 22 cm long. He was brought to intensive care where he underwent four and a half hours of surgery to reattach his broken bones, flesh and nerves. Despite the police offering a potential HK$500,000 reward, no arrests were made and the motive for the attack remains unknown. The attack shocked Hong Kong society and raised concerns about freedom of speech in the former British colony, one year after the handover to China at the time.

Premier Glen Clark of British Columbia visited him in the hospital during his official visit to Hong Kong. The same year, Premier Clark introduced him to the BC assembly, where he was recognised. Cheng returned to host &quot;Teacup in a Storm&quot; later in the year.

Despite his vast popularity, Cheng&#x27;s contract with Commercial Radio was terminated abruptly and unilaterally in 2004 as the station buckled under political pressure in the run-up to the renewal of its broadcasting license.
== Legislative career ==
After Commercial Radio had dismissed him under political pressure, Cheng decided to run for a place in the legislature. He gave up his Canadian citizenship in 2004 to comply with local election requirements for direct elections to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. 

He won a seat in the Legislative Council and tackled vital issues such as the opening up of the public airwaves, imposing tighter tobacco control, introducing food labelling, and regulating against unscrupulous practices in the sales of residential flats.

Cheng was opposed to the privatisation of the government&#x27;s shopping malls and car parks in its public housing estates. He was concerned that the ill-considered move would undermine the interests of the low-income public housing tenants, especially the elderly ones. He strived in vain to stop the related listing of the Link REIT on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2005.

Cheng was appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR for four years to serve on the Independent Police Complaints Commission , which is tasked with monitoring the review by the Complaints Against Police Office of complaints against members of the Police Force. And he also served as a member of the Film Development Council. During his appointment at the IPCC Cheng served as the Chairman of the Publicity Committee.During his legislative tenure Cheng chaired the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting of the law-making body and promoted an &quot;open sky&quot; policy for the electronic media. He also sit on two standing committee included the Public Account Committee and Member Interest Committee.

== Digital radio proprietorship ==
In 2008, Cheng announced that he would not seek re-election to Legco to avoid possible conflict of interests in his efforts to apply for a license to operate a radio station. His Wave Media was awarded a license in 2009 to prepare for Hong Kong&#x27;s first Digital Audio Broadcast service, under the banner of Digital Broadcasting Corporation (DBC).

He ran into a major argument with other shareholders as he insisted on an independent editorial policy that is critical of government failings. He founded D100 Radio, an online multimedia operation, after leaving his role as DBC chairman. 

== Charity and community service ==
Cheng is a voting member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the first Asian charity donor to be listed in the world&#x27;s top 10.

He also sat on another major charity in Hong Kong, the Community Chest. He was a member of the Public Relations Committee and Corporate &amp; Employee Contribution Programme Organizing Committee of the Community Chest, which is a statutory body functioning as an umbrella organisation to provide grants to a wide range of community projects.

In 1996, the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) was founded by Albert Cheng, Dr. C.K. Law (GBS, JP), and a group of individuals, in response to a prolonged cold spell during which more than one hundred elderly living alone were found dead. The association is a self-financing social enterprise and charitable organization in Hong Kong that offers 24-hour personal caring and emergency assistance services to the elderly and others. The Association was recognised by United Nation as an outstanding innovative organisation. 

From 2003 to 2004, Cheng served as a member of the Securities &amp; Futures Commission Public Shareholders Group to advise on issues relating to safeguarding shareholders&#x27; rights and interests.

Cheng was chairman of the second Hong Kong Film Awards Organizing Committee in 1984. He was a member of the Hong Kong Film Development Council from 2011 to 2013 to advise the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development on relevant policies and activities, including manpower training, Mainland and overseas promotion, and support for the film industry.

== Academic service ==
Cheng acts as Asia adviser to the Provost and responsible for establishing the Greater China Scholarship of the University of Notre Dame. He was on the board of Hong Kong Shue Yan University&#x27;s academic advisory board and curriculum vetting committee.

He was a governor and honorary development director of the English Schools Foundation (ESF), the biggest international educational foundation in Asia which runs 22 educational institutions mostly international schools in Hong Kong.
Cheng was also a vetting committee member for the digital media courses of the Vocational Training Council, the largest vocational and professional education and training provider serving 250,000 students a year in Hong Kong.

He was honorary vice-president of the Economic &amp; Finance Society of the University of Hong Kong, and honorary advisor of the Society of Business Administration of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

== Personal life ==
Cheng married the Cantopop diva Paula Tsui in Canada in 1974, but that marriage ended in divorce five years later. In 1987 he married Irene Lo Kam-seung, Miss Hong Kong pageant winner of 1981, with whom he has three sons. He resettled in Vancouver in 2019.

<doc id="984053" wikidata="Q1256980" url="?curid=984053" title="Lateral sulcus">
<text>The lateral sulcus (or lateral fissure, also called Sylvian fissure, after Franciscus Sylvius) is the most prominent sulcus of each cerebral hemisphere in the human brain. The lateral sulcus is a deep fissure in each hemisphere that separates the frontal and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe. The insular cortex lies deep within the lateral sulcus.

==Anatomy==
The lateral sulcus divides both the frontal lobe and parietal lobe above from the temporal lobe below. It is in both hemispheres of the brain. The lateral sulcus is one of the earliest-developing sulci of the human brain, appearing around the fourteenth week of gestational age.

The insular cortex lies deep within the lateral sulcus.

The lateral sulcus has a number of side branches. Two of the most prominent and most regularly found are the ascending (also called vertical) ramus and the horizontal ramus of the lateral fissure, which subdivide the inferior frontal gyrus. The lateral sulcus also contains the transverse temporal gyri, which are part of the primary and below the surface auditory cortex.

Due to a phenomenon called the Yakovlevian torque, the lateral sulcus is often longer and less curved on the left hemisphere than on the right.

It is also located near the Sylvian point.

The area lying around the Sylvian fissure is often referred to as the perisylvian cortex.

The human secondary somatosensory cortex (S2, SII) is a functionally-defined region of cortex in the parietal operculum on the ceiling of the lateral sulcus.

==Discovery==

The cerebral cortex was not depicted in a realistic manner until the 17th century with the Sylvian fissure being first accurately painted by Girolamo Fabrici d&#x27;Acquapendente in 1600 to provide plates for his &quot;Tabulae Pictae&quot;.

Its first description is traditionally taken to be in 1641, possibly by Caspar Bartholin, where its discovery was attributed to Franciscus Sylvius (1614–1672), professor of medicine at Leiden University in the book &quot;Casp. Bartolini Institutiones Anatomicae&quot; where it is noted that &quot;F.S. [F.S. probably refers to Franciscus Sylvius] If you examine the indentations which are represented in Figure 5 quite attentively, you will notice that they are very deep and that the brain is divided from one side to the other by the &#x27;anfractuosa fissura,&#x27; which starts in the front part near the ocular roots, and from there moves backwards above the base of the spinal cord, following the temporal bones, and it divides the upper part of the brain from the lower.&quot;

It seems likely, however, that, since Caspar Bartholin died in 1629 and Franciscus Sylvius only started medicine in 1632, these words are by either Caspar&#x27;s son Thomas Bartholin or Franciscus Sylvius himself. In 1663 in his &quot;Disputationem Medicarum&quot;, Sylvius described the lateral fissure: &quot;Particularly noticeable is the deep fissure or hiatus which begins at the roots of the eyes (oculorum radices) . . . it runs posteriorly above the temples as far as the roots of the brain stem (medulla radices). . . . It divides the cerebrum into an upper, larger part and a lower, smaller part&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Pop musician David Bowie referred to psychologist Carl Jung as &quot;...crashing out with Sylvian&quot; in his lyrics to &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; released on his 1973 album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. In 2015, artist Tanja Stark suggested Bowie had drawn a cryptic link between Jung&#x27;s waking hallucinatory visions (see &quot;The Red Book&quot;) and the Sylvian fissure, a region discovered by that time to produce hallucinogenic visions and ‘paranormal’ perceptions when electrically stimulated and, presciently in 2006, to generate what neurologists called an ‘illusory shadow person’ or doppelgänger phenomenon; themselves highly charged and recurring Bowie archetypes (Penfield 1955; Arzy et al., 2006). Stark notes another song on that album &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; sings of the hallucinatory spectre of ..&quot;a crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me&quot;, evoking the iconic imagery of Michelangelo&#x27;s painting The Creation of Adam. 
Stark observes that the American Medical Journal reported that Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot; appears to conform deliberately to the neuroanatomical shape of the brain, its Sylvian fissure clearly evident, suggesting Michelangelo may have intentionally conflated theology with neurology ( Meshberger 1990: 1837). Others though, have likened the cloak to the uterus and umbilical cord.

<text>In astrodynamics, orbit phasing is the adjustment of the time-position of spacecraft along its orbit, usually described as adjusting the orbiting spacecraft&#x27;s true anomaly. Orbital phasing is primarily used in scenarios where a spacecraft in a given orbit must be moved to a different location within the same orbit. The change in position within the orbit is usually defined as the phase angle, &quot;ϕ&quot;, and is the change in true anomaly required between the spacecraft&#x27;s current position to the final position.

The phase angle can be converted in terms of time using Kepler&#x27;s Equation:

formula_1
formula_2
where
*&quot;t&quot; is defined as time elapsed to cover phase angle in original orbit
*&quot;T&quot;1 is defined as period of original orbit
*&quot;E&quot; is defined as change of eccentric anomaly between spacecraft and final position 
*&quot;e&quot;1 is defined as orbital eccentricity of original orbit
*&quot;φ&quot; is defined as change in true anomaly between spacecraft and final position

This time derived from the phase angle is the required time the spacecraft must gain or lose to be located at the final position within the orbit. To gain or lose this time, the spacecraft must be subjected to a simple two-impulse Hohmann transfer which takes the spacecraft away from, and then back to, its original orbit. The first impulse to change the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit is performed at a specific point in the original orbit (point of impulse, POI), usually performed in the original orbit&#x27;s periapsis or apoapsis. The impulse creates a new orbit called the “phasing orbit” and is larger or smaller than the original orbit resulting in a different period time than the original orbit. The difference in period time between the original and phasing orbits will be equal to the time converted from the phase angle. Once one period of the phasing orbit is complete, the spacecraft will return to the POI and the spacecraft will once again be subjected to a second impulse, equal and opposite to the first impulse, to return it to the original orbit. When complete, the spacecraft will be in the targeted final position within the original orbit.

To find some of the phasing orbital parameters, first one must find the required period time of the phasing orbit using the following equation.

formula_3
where
*&quot;T&quot;1 is defined as period of original orbit
*&quot;T&quot;2 is defined as period of phasing orbit
*&quot;t&quot; is defined as time elapsed to cover phase angle in original orbit

Once phasing orbit period is determined, the phasing orbit semimajor axis can be derived from the period formula:

formula_4
where
*&quot;a&quot;2 is defined as semimajor axis of phasing orbit
*&quot;T&quot;2 is defined as period of phasing orbit
*&quot;μ&quot; is defined as Standard gravitational parameter

From the semimajor axis, the phase orbit apogee and perigee can be calculated:
formula_5
where
*&quot;a&quot;2 is defined as semimajor axis of phasing orbit
*&quot;r&quot;a is defined as apogee of phasing orbit
*&quot;r&quot;p is defined as perigee of phasing orbit

Finally, the phasing orbit&#x27;s angular momentum can be found from the equation:
formula_6
where
*&quot;h&quot;2 is defined as angular momentum of phasing orbit
*&quot;r&quot;a is defined as apogee of phasing orbit
*&quot;r&quot;p is defined as perigee of phasing orbit
*&quot;μ&quot; is defined as Standard gravitational parameter

To find the impulse required to change the spacecraft from its original orbit to the phasing orbit, the change of spacecraft velocity, ∆&quot;V&quot;, at POI must be calculated from the angular momentum formula:
formula_7
where
*∆&quot;V&quot; is change in velocity between phasing and original orbits at POI
*&quot;v&quot;1 is defined as the spacecraft velocity at POI in original orbit
*&quot;v&quot;2 is defined as the spacecraft velocity at POI in phasing orbit
*&quot;r&quot; is defined as radius of spacecraft from the orbit’s focal point to POI
*&quot;h&quot;1 is defined as specific angular momentum of the original orbit
*&quot;h&quot;2 is defined as specific angular momentum of the phasing orbit

Remember that this change in velocity, ∆&quot;V&quot;, is only the amount required to change the spacecraft from its original orbit to the phasing orbit. A second change in velocity equal to the magnitude but opposite in direction of the first must be done after the spacecraft travels one phase orbit period to return the spacecraft from the phasing orbit to the original orbit. Total change of velocity required for the phasing maneuver is equal to two times ∆&quot;V&quot;.

Orbit phasing can also be referenced as co-orbital rendezvous like a successful approach to a space station in a docking maneuver. Here, two spacecraft on the same orbit but at different true anomalies rendezvous by either one or both of the spacecraft entering phasing orbits which cause them to return to their original orbit at the same true anomaly at the same time.

Phasing maneuvers are also commonly employed by geosynchronous satellites, either to conduct station-keeping maneuvers to maintain their orbit above a specific longitude, or to change longitude altogether.

<doc id="984062" wikidata="Q1352777" url="?curid=984062" title="Sequence (filmmaking)">
<text>In film, a sequence is a scene or a series of scenes that form a distinct narrative unit to advance the narrative, usually connected either by a unity of location or a unity of time. Each of these sequences might further contain sub-sequences. It is also known by the French term, &quot;plan séquence&quot;. Sequence shots give the editor plenty of shots to tell a story and keep audiences&#x27; attention.

Sequencing refers to what one shoots, with the five most common shots used being: close-ups, wide angle, medium, over the shoulder, and point of view shots. Sequencing keeps viewer interest while maintaining a consistent story. The five most common shots are used to build a framework of where to place the characters or action.

The sequence is one of a hierarchy of structural units used to describe the structure of films in varying degrees of granularity. Analyzed this way, a film is composed of one or more acts; acts include one or more sequences; sequences are divided into one or more scenes; and scenes may be thought of as being built out of shots (if one is thinking visually) or beats (if one is thinking in narrative terms).

The sequence paradigm or the &quot;8 sequence structure&quot; of screenwriting was developed by Frank Daniel. In 2004, his protege Paul Gulino, published a book about this paradigm called, “Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach”.

<doc id="984064" wikidata="Q526228" url="?curid=984064" title="Mud sunfish">
<text>The mud sunfish (Acantharchus pomotis) is a freshwater ray-finned fish, a sunfish from the family Centrarchidae, which widely distributed in the fresh waters along the Atlantic coast of North America, ranging from New York to Alabama. It is the only species in the genus &quot;Acantharchus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The mud sunfish was first formally described as &quot;Centrarchus pomotis&quot; by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1855 with the type locality given as Cedar Swamp Creek, Beesley&#x27;s Point, Cape May County, New Jersey and the Hackensack River, Rockland County, New York. In 1864, Theodore Nicholas Gill placed it in its own monospecific genus &quot;Acantharchus&quot;, the new genus name being a compound of the Greek words meaning &quot;thorn&quot; and meaning &quot;anus&quot;.

==Description==
The mud sunfish is a small fish which can be distinguished from other members of its family by its possession of five or more spines in its anal fin, by having less than 15 gill rakers and in being the only species in its family that has cycloid scales. 

Its body is oblong and compressed with a large mouth and eyes. This species has rounded pectoral and caudal fins. which are clear through to dark olive in color and the anal fin has a black margin. It has a dark spot on the gill cover and the color of its body varies from brown on the back to yellowish tan on the flanks, while the juveniles are pale olive. There are three or four parallel dusky, horizontal stripes which extend from the cheek along the body. They can grow to a maximum total length of , although is a more common total length.

==Distribution and habitat==

The mud sunfish occurs along the eastern seaboard of the United States from southern New York south as far as northern Florida. The range of this species just extends into Alabama where they have been recorded in Beaver dam Creek in Washington County. There is a gap in their range in Maryland and Virginia, along the western part of Chesapeake Bay between the Susquehanna River and the Potomac River. It is not common anywhere in its range.

The mud sunfish is found in freshwaters which are stained dark with tannins. It has been recorded in slow-moving sluggish, well vegetated creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes and swamps. As its common name suggests it prefers substrates consisting of mud or detritus.

==Breeding==
This is a nocturnal species which lives at naturally low densities and as a result there have been few studies conducted on it. What has been discovered is that spawning appears to vary with latitude with gravid females being collected during the late spring and early summer in Delaware while further south, in North Carolina and Georgia spawning takes place during the early fall and late winter. They have a maximum life span of 8 years and sexual maturity is attained at one year old. Their diet is made up largely of invertebrates including amphipods, decapods, and beetles with some smaller fishes and Odonata.

==Conservation==
The IUCN has assessed the status of the mud sunfish as Least Concern and states that its population is stable. In individual states, however, there have been significant reductions in the species range. In New York the species was only recorded from the Hackensack River and it has not been collected from there since 1935. Its range has also significantly reduced in New Jersey, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state but it remains reasonable common and widespread in the Pinelands. In New Jersey the fish&#x27;s decline is possibly a result of a number of reasons including land use and habitat changes and the introduction of non-native fish which predate on the mud sunfish and in this state it has been recommended that it be classified as a species of special concern. It has been extirpated from Pennsylvania.

<doc id="984070" wikidata="Q334037" url="?curid=984070" title="Relief valve">
<text>A relief valve or pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; excessive pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, explosion, or fire. 

==Pressure relief==
Excess pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the &quot;path of least resistance&quot; as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. 

In systems containing flammable fluids, the diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is either recaptured by a low pressure, high-flow vapor recovery system or is routed through a piping system known as a &quot;flare header&quot; or &quot;relief header&quot; to a central, elevated gas flare where it is burned, releasing naked combustion gases into the atmosphere. In non-hazardous systems, the fluid is often discharged to the atmosphere by a suitable discharge pipework designed to prevent rainwater ingress which can affect the set lift pressure, and positioned not to cause a hazard to personnel. 

As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve&#x27;s reseating pressure, the valve will close. The &quot;blowdown&quot; is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary roughly 2–20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns. 

In high-pressure gas systems, it is recommended that the outlet of the relief valve be in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build-up in the piping system downstream of the relief valve. This often means that the relief valve will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so-called &quot;differential&quot; relief valves are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the area of the opening of the valve. If the valve is opened, the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in the exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation.

In some cases, a so-called &quot;bypass valve&quot; acts as a relief valve by being used to return all or part of the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor. This is done to protect the pump or gas compressor and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path). Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.

In other cases, equipment must be protected against being subjected to an internal vacuum (i.e., low pressure) that is lower than the equipment can withstand. In such cases, &quot;vacuum relief valves&quot; are used to open at a predetermined low-pressure limit and to admit air or an inert gas into the equipment to control the amount of vacuum.

==Technical terms==
In the petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing and power generation industries, the term relief valve is associated with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and safety valve:
* Pressure relief valve (PRV) or Pressure Release valve (PRV) or pressure safety valve (PSV): The difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to activate the valve in case of emergency. Most PRVs are spring operated. At lower pressures some use a diaphragm in place of a spring. The oldest PRV designs use a weight to seal the valve. 
* Set pressure: When the system pressure increases to this value, the PRV opens. The accuracy of the set pressure may follow guidelines set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). 
* Relief valve (RV): A valve is used on a liquid service, which opens proportionally as the increasing pressure overcomes the spring pressure. 
* Safety valve (SV): Used in gas service. Most SVs are full lift or snap-acting, in that they pop completely open. 
* Safety relief valve (SRV): A relief valve that can be used for gas or liquid service. However, the set pressure will usually only be accurate for one type of fluid at a time. 
* Pilot-operated relief valve (POSRV, PORV, POPRV): A device that relieves by remote command from a pilot valve which is connected to the upstream system pressure.
* Low-pressure safety valve (LPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small and near the atmospheric pressure.
* Vacuum pressure safety valve (VPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, and near the atmospheric pressure.
* Low and vacuum pressure safety valve (LVPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, or positive, and near the atmospheric pressure.
* Pressure vacuum release valve (PVRV): A combination of vacuum pressure and a relief valve in one housing. Used on storage tanks for liquids to prevent implosion or overpressure.
* Snap acting: The opposite of modulating, refers to a valve that &quot;pops&quot; open. It snaps into a full lift in milliseconds. Usually accomplished with a skirt on the disc so that the fluid passing the seat suddenly affects a larger area and creates more lifting force. 
* Modulating: Opens in proportion to the overpressure.

==Legal and code requirements in industry==
In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American Petroleum Institute (API) and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with and those codes include design standards for relief valves.

The main standards, laws, or directives are:
* &quot;AD Merkblatt&quot; (German)
* American Petroleum Institute (API); Standards 520, 521, 526, and 2000
* American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII Division 1 and Section I
* American Water Works Association (AWWA), storage tanks
* EN 764-7; European Standard based on pressure Equipment Directive 97/23/EC
* Eurocode EN 1993-4-2, storage tanks.
* International Organization for Standardization; ISO 4126
* Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR); UK

== Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems (DIERS) ==
Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems was a consortium of 29 companies under the auspices of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency relief systems to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure relief systems for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations, and many others. Pressure relief systems can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapor, liquid, or a mixture of the two – just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.

DIERS has investigated the two-phase vapor-liquid onset/disengagement dynamics and the hydrodynamics of emergency relief systems with extensive experimental and analysis work. Of particular interest to DIERS were the prediction of two-phase flow venting and the applicability of various sizing methods for two-phase vapor-liquid flashing flow. DIERS became a user&#x27;s group in 1985.

European DIERS Users&#x27; Group (EDUG) is a group of mainly European industrialists, consultants and academics who use the DIERS technology. The EDUG started in the late 1980s and has an annual meeting. A summary of many of key aspects of the DIERS technology has been published in the UK by the HSE.

<text>A space rendezvous () is a set of orbital maneuvers during which two spacecraft, one of which is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities and position vectors of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.

The same rendezvous technique can be used for spacecraft &quot;landing&quot; on natural objects with a weak gravitational field, e.g. landing on one of the Martian moons would require the same matching of orbital velocities, followed by a &quot;descent&quot; that shares some similarities with docking.

== History ==
In its first human spaceflight program Vostok, the Soviet Union launched pairs of spacecraft from the same launch pad, one or two days apart (Vostok 3 and 4 in 1962, and Vostok 5 and 6 in 1963). In each case, the launch vehicles&#x27; guidance systems inserted the two craft into nearly identical orbits; however, this was not nearly precise enough to achieve rendezvous, as the Vostok lacked maneuvering thrusters to adjust its orbit to match that of its twin. The initial separation distances were in the range of , and slowly diverged to thousands of kilometers (over a thousand miles) over the course of the missions.

In early 1964 the Soviet Union were able to guide two unmanned satellites designated Polyot 1 and Polyot 2 within 5km, and the crafts were able to establish radio communication.

In 1963 Buzz Aldrin submitted his doctoral thesis titled, &quot; Line-Of-Sight Guidance Techniques For Manned Orbital Rendezvous.&quot; As a NASA astronaut, Aldrin worked to &quot;translate complex orbital mechanics into relatively simple flight plans for my colleagues.&quot;

===First attempt failed===

NASA&#x27;s first attempt at rendezvous was made on June 3, 1965, when US astronaut Jim McDivitt tried to maneuver his Gemini 4 craft to meet its spent Titan II launch vehicle&#x27;s upper stage. McDivitt was unable to get close enough to achieve station-keeping, due to depth-perception problems, and stage propellant venting which kept moving it around.
However, the Gemini 4 attempts at rendezvous were unsuccessful largely because NASA engineers had yet to learn the orbital mechanics involved in the process. Simply pointing the active vehicle&#x27;s nose at the target and thrusting was unsuccessful. If the target is ahead in the orbit and the tracking vehicle increases speed, its altitude also increases, actually moving it away from the target. The higher altitude then increases orbital period due to Kepler&#x27;s third law, putting the tracker not only above, but also behind the target. The proper technique requires changing the tracking vehicle&#x27;s orbit to allow the rendezvous target to either catch up or be caught up with, and then at the correct moment changing to the same orbit as the target with no relative motion between the vehicles (for example, putting the tracker into a lower orbit, which has a shorter orbital period allowing it to catch up, then executing a Hohmann transfer back to the original orbital height).

===First successful rendezvous===

Rendezvous was first successfully accomplished by US astronaut Wally Schirra on December 15, 1965. Schirra maneuvered the Gemini 6 spacecraft within of its sister craft Gemini 7. The spacecraft were not equipped to dock with each other, but maintained station-keeping for more than 20 minutes. Schirra later commented:

Schirra used another metaphor to describe the difference between the two nations&#x27; achievements:

===First docking===

The first docking of two spacecraft was achieved on March 16, 1966 when Gemini 8, under the command of Neil Armstrong, rendezvoused and docked with an uncrewed Agena Target Vehicle. Gemini 6 was to have been the first docking mission, but had to be cancelled when that mission&#x27;s Agena vehicle was destroyed during launch.

The Soviets carried out the first automated, uncrewed docking between Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188 on October 30, 1967.

The first Soviet cosmonaut to attempt a manual docking was Georgy Beregovoy who unsuccessfully tried to dock his Soyuz 3 craft with the uncrewed Soyuz 2 in October 1968. Automated systems brought the craft to within , while Beregovoy brought this closer with manual control.

The first successful crewed docking occurred on January 16, 1969 when Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 docked, collecting the two crew members of Soyuz 5, which had to perform an extravehicular activity to reach Soyuz 4.

In March 1969 Apollo 9 achieved the first internal transfer of crew members between two docked spacecraft.

The first rendezvous of two spacecraft from different countries took place in 1975, when an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soyuz spacecraft as part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission.

The first multiple space docking took place when both Soyuz 26 and Soyuz 27 were docked to the Salyut 6 space station during January 1978.

== Uses ==
A rendezvous takes place each time a spacecraft brings crew members or supplies to an orbiting space station. The first spacecraft to do this was Soyuz 11, which successfully docked with the Salyut 1 station on June 7, 1971. Human spaceflight missions have successfully made rendezvous with six Salyut stations, with Skylab, with &quot;Mir&quot; and with the International Space Station (ISS). Currently Soyuz spacecraft are used at approximately six month intervals to transport crew members to and from ISS. With the introduction of NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Program, the US is able to use their own launch vehicle along with the Soyuz, an updated version of SpaceX&#x27;s Cargo Dragon; Crew Dragon. 
Robotic spacecraft are also used to rendezvous with and resupply space stations. Soyuz and Progress spacecraft have automatically docked with both &quot;Mir&quot; and the ISS using the Kurs docking system, Europe&#x27;s Automated Transfer Vehicle also used this system to dock with the Russian segment of the ISS. Several uncrewed spacecraft use NASA&#x27;s berthing mechanism rather than a docking port. The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), SpaceX Dragon, and Orbital Sciences&#x27; Cygnus spacecraft all maneuver to a close rendezvous and maintain station-keeping, allowing the ISS Canadarm2 to grapple and move the spacecraft to a berthing port on the US segment. However the updated version of Cargo Dragon will no longer need to berth but instead will autonomously dock directly to the space station. The Russian segment only uses docking ports so it is not possible for HTV, Dragon and Cygnus to find a berth there.

Space rendezvous has been used for a variety of other purposes, including recent service missions to the Hubble Space Telescope. Historically, for the missions of Project Apollo that landed astronauts on the Moon, the ascent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module would rendezvous and dock with the Apollo Command/Service Module in lunar orbit rendezvous maneuvers. Also, the STS-49 crew rendezvoused with and attached a rocket motor to the Intelsat VI F-3 communications satellite to allow it to make an orbital maneuver.

Possible future rendezvous may be made by a yet to be developed automated Hubble Robotic Vehicle (HRV), and by the CX-OLEV, which is being developed for rendezvous with a geosynchronous satellite that has run out of fuel. The CX-OLEV would take over orbital stationkeeping and/or finally bring the satellite to a graveyard orbit, after which the CX-OLEV can possibly be reused for another satellite. Gradual transfer from the geostationary transfer orbit to the geosynchronous orbit will take a number of months, using Hall effect thrusters.

Alternatively the two spacecraft are already together, and just undock and dock in a different way:
*Soyuz spacecraft from one docking point to another on the ISS or Salyut
*In the Apollo spacecraft, a maneuver known as transposition, docking, and extraction was performed an hour or so after Trans Lunar Injection of the sequence third stage of the Saturn V rocket / LM inside LM adapter / CSM (in order from bottom to top at launch, also the order from back to front with respect to the current motion), with CSM crewed, LM at this stage uncrewed:
**the CSM separated, while the four upper panels of the LM adapter were disposed of
**the CSM turned 180 degrees (from engine backward, toward LM, to forward)
**the CSM connected to the LM while that was still connected to the third stage
**the CSM/LM combination then separated from the third stage

NASA sometimes refers to &quot;Rendezvous, Proximity-Operations, Docking, and Undocking&quot; (RPODU) for the set of all spaceflight procedures that are typically needed around spacecraft operations where two spacecraft work in proximity to one another with intent to connect to one another.

== Phases and methods ==

The standard technique for rendezvous and docking is to dock an active vehicle, the &quot;chaser&quot;, with a passive &quot;target&quot;. This technique has been used successfully for the Gemini, Apollo, Apollo/Soyuz, Salyut, Skylab, Mir, ISS, and Tiangong programs.

To properly understand spacecraft rendezvous it is essential to understand the relation between spacecraft velocity and orbit. A spacecraft in a certain orbit cannot arbitrarily alter its velocity. Each orbit correlates to a certain orbital velocity. If the spacecraft fires thrusters and increases (or decreases) its velocity it will obtain a different orbit, one with a higher or lower altitude. In circular orbits, higher orbits have a lower orbital velocity. Lower orbits have a higher orbital velocity.

For orbital rendezvous to occur, both spacecraft must be in the same orbital plane, and the phase of the orbit (the position of the spacecraft in the orbit) must be matched. For docking, the speed of the two vehicles must also be matched. The &quot;chaser&quot; is placed in a slightly lower orbit than the target. The lower the orbit, the higher the orbital velocity. The difference in orbital velocities of chaser and target is therefore such that the chaser is faster than the target, and catches up with it.

Once the two spacecraft are sufficiently close, the chaser&#x27;s orbit is synchronized with the target&#x27;s orbit. That is, the chaser will be accelerated. This increase in velocity carries the chaser to a higher orbit. The increase in velocity is chosen such that the chaser approximately assumes the orbit of the target. Stepwise, the chaser closes in on the target, until proximity operations (see below) can be started.
In the very final phase, the closure rate is reduced by use of the active vehicle&#x27;s reaction control system.
Docking typically occurs at a rate of to .

===Rendezvous phases===
Space rendezvous of an active, or &quot;chaser&quot;, spacecraft with an (assumed) passive spacecraft may be divided into several phases, and typically starts with the two spacecraft in separate orbits, typically separated by more than :

A variety of techniques may be used to effect the translational and rotational maneuvers necessary for proximity operations and docking.

===Methods of approach===

The two most common methods of approach for proximity operations are in-line with the flight path of the spacecraft (called V-bar, as it is along the velocity vector of the target) and perpendicular to the flight path along the line of the radius of the orbit (called R-bar, as it is along the radial vector, with respect to Earth, of the target).
The chosen method of approach depends on safety, spacecraft / thruster design, mission timeline, and, especially for docking with the ISS, on the location of the assigned docking port.

==== V-bar approach====
The V-bar approach is an approach of the &quot;chaser&quot; horizontally along the passive spacecraft&#x27;s velocity vector. That is, from behind or from ahead, and in the same direction as the orbital motion of the passive target. The motion is to the target&#x27;s orbital velocity.
In the V-bar approach from behind, the chaser fires small thrusters to increase its velocity in the direction of the target. This, of course, also drives the chaser to a higher orbit. To keep the chaser on the V-vector, other thrusters are fired in the radial direction. If this is omitted (for example due to a thruster failure), the chaser will be carried to a higher orbit, which is associated with an orbital velocity lower than the target&#x27;s. Consequently, the target moves faster than the chaser and the distance between them increases. This is called a &quot;natural braking effect&quot;, and is a natural safeguard in case of a thruster failure.

STS-104 was the third Space Shuttle mission to conduct a V-bar arrival at the International Space Station. The V-bar, or velocity vector, extends along a line directly ahead of the station. Shuttles approach the ISS along the V-bar when docking at the PMA-2 docking port.

==== R-bar approach====
The R-bar approach consists of the chaser moving below or above the target spacecraft, along its radial vector. The motion is orthogonal to the orbital velocity of the passive spacecraft.
When below the target the chaser fires radial thrusters to close in on the target. By this it increases its altitude. However, the orbital velocity of the chaser remains unchanged (thruster firings in the radial direction have no effect on the orbital velocity). Now in a slightly higher position, but with an orbital velocity that does not correspond to the local circular velocity, the chaser slightly falls behind the target. Small rocket pulses in the orbital velocity direction are necessary to keep the chaser along the radial vector of the target. If these rocket pulses are not executed (for example due to a thruster failure), the chaser will move away from the target. This is a &quot;natural braking effect&quot;. For the R-bar approach, this effect is stronger than for the V-bar approach, making the R-bar approach the safer one of the two.
Generally, the R-bar approach from below is preferable, as the chaser is in a lower (faster) orbit than the target, and thus &quot;catches up&quot; with it. For the R-bar approach from above, the chaser is in a higher (slower) orbit than the target, and thus has to wait for the target to approach it.

Astrotech proposed meeting ISS cargo needs with a vehicle which would approach the station, &quot;using a traditional nadir R-bar approach.&quot; The nadir R-bar approach is also used for flights to the ISS of H-II Transfer Vehicles, and of SpaceX Dragon vehicles.

==== Z-bar approach====
An approach of the active, or &quot;chaser&quot;, spacecraft horizontally from the side and orthogonal to the orbital plane of the passive spacecraft—that is, from the side and out-of-plane of the orbit of the passive spacecraft—is called a Z-bar approach.

==Surface rendezvous==

Apollo 12, the second crewed lunar landing, performed the first ever rendezvous outside of Low Earth Orbit by landing close to Surveyor 3 and taking parts of it back to Earth.

<doc id="984082" wikidata="Q1277791" url="?curid=984082" title="East Coast Parkway">
<text>The East Coast Parkway (Abbreviation: ECP) is a fully-controlled access expressway that runs along the southeastern coast of Singapore. It is approximately in length. As of July 2022, it is Singapore&#x27;s third-longest expressway. The expressway serves a vital function by being the primary highway from the airport to the central area. 

The ECP connects Changi Airport in the east through the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to the Marina Bay and Central Business District areas in the south. 

The ECP connects to three other expressways, the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) and the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) at the 14 kilometre mark, and to the Pan Island Expressway at the Changi Flyover, about from the end of the expressway. The ECP will also connect to the future North–South Corridor near the 15 kilometre mark. 

Unlike other expressways in Singapore whose abbreviation ends with &#x27;E&#x27; for &#x27;Expressway&#x27;, the East Coast Parkway abbreviation ends with &#x27;P&#x27; instead.

The East Coast Parkway used to be directly connected to the AYE. However, with the opening of the MCE on 29 December 2013, a section of expressway after the Benjamin Sheares Bridge was truncated and another section at the Marina South area realigned and converted into an arterial road.

The expressway, together with the MCE and the AYE could be interpreted as the southern east-west road in Singapore.

The expressway first heads southeast from Changi Airport before curving to follow the coastline after Xilin Avenue. It then follows East Coast Park past Upper East Coast, Siglap, Marine Parade and Mountbatten areas. After Exit 13 for Fort Road (signed 14A eastbound), the ECP curves further inland passing through the interchange with the MCE and KPE before the Benjamin Sheares Bridge which offers a beautiful view of the downtown. The highway (still on the bridge) curves south and into the Marina Bay Area, passing Marina Bay Sands.

The ECP then ends near the 16-kilometre mark and merges with Sheares Avenue (newly formed as part of the truncated section of the former route). From Sheares Avenue, a left turn goes to Marina Boulevard towards Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Cruise Centre, or a right turn enters Central Boulevard that heads towards the Downtown Core and Chinatown.

==History==
Plans for the coastal highway to reduce congestion at Golden Mile started on 30 July 1969. Detailed plans were put in place to create interchanges at Nicoll Highway, Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road. On 3 September 1970, a $35 million plan was put in place to reclaim more land off of Bedok, with the final phase starting on 7 October 1970. On 18 December 1970, the government decided to reclaim more than 125 acres of land.

On 24 May 1973, the government proceeded to build a $300 million highway across the harbour to the breakwater line outside Clifford Pier to ease peak hour congestion at the Collyer Quay area. The plans involved the reclamation of land off Nicoll Highway and the breakwater at Clifford Pier. Reclamation was expected to begin in six to nine months. The 280m long bridge was to be built at a height of 30 ft above high water level to allow ample headroom for ferries to use the channel. The new highway would turn landwards to South Quay and then to the vacant piece of land past the Singapore Polytechnic, before turning towards Anson Road. To provide space for construction work, the government acquired the former Singapore Polytechnic site in 1975, with the polytechnic shifting to Dover. Plans were made on 16 January 1974 to extend Siglap Road to the expressway. On 28 February 1974, the government also acquired two portions of land, for the extension of Bedok South Avenue 1 from Upper East Coast Road to the ECP.

On 12 June 1974, tenders were invited for the construction of the super-highway which would link the east coast of Singapore to the city. The extension of East Coast Parkway was to run from Tanjong Rhu via the Kallang River to Marina Centre. Between the two crossings, the expressway would be connected to an interchange formed by a one-way pair of roads running on the reclaimed Marina Centre, connecting Ophir and Rochor Roads at Beach Road. It would take traffic to Orchard, Chinatown and Little India. It would also run through the reclaimed land in front of Shenton Way and Raffles Quay, before going to the Telok Ayer Basin at South Quay, where it would connect to the one-way pair of roads at Prince Edward Road and Maxwell Road. It was planned to run on the elevated structure across the former Singapore Polytechnic at Shenton Way. A separate project was planned to even extend the expressway to Keppel Road, before going towards the Jurong Expressway (to be known as Ayer Rajah Expressway).

On 24 April 1975, five international firms were invited to the tender of the construction of East Coast Parkway, leading to the construction of Benjamin Sheares Bridge, named after the then President of Singapore, Benjamin Sheares. The expressway would also be linked to Ophir/Rochor Road, which would be built together with the flyover. The first phase would cover the portion from Tanjong Rhu Flyover to South Quay, while another section would lead from South Quay to Shenton Way.

Construction of the first phase of the East Coast Parkway from Fort Road to Marine Parade started in 1971 and was completed in December 1975. It was followed by an extension of Phase 2 which was completed in November 1975 to Bedok South Road and then Phase 3 was built together with Changi Airport in 1980. Construction of Phase 3 began in May 1976, with two interchanges at Xilin Avenue and the Pan Island Expressway. It was expected to be completed by 1978. They were built on reclaimed land by the former Public Works Department.

Construction of Phase 4, stretching from Fort Road to Keppel Road began in 1977 and was opened on 18 April 1981 to Ophir Road, and on 26 September 1981 towards Keppel Road. The government had decided to further reclaim the Marina South area, linking Tanjong Rhu and Telok Ayer Basin.

Traffic lights remained on the expressway until the completion of the last flyover at Fort Road in 1989. The opening of ECP relieved the traffic load of the city area in the 1980s. Traffic volume at Nicoll Highway decreased by 20 per cent, which would otherwise worsen with the implemented ERP gantries. Robinson Road and Cecil Street were better managed with lesser traffic jams with the declining load all the way to 1990s.

Flanked by East Coast Park on one side and high-rise housing on the other, the well-landscaped expressway was built and maintained with the conscious intention of giving visitors arriving via Singapore Changi Airport a good first impression of the country as they commute from the airport to the city centre.

Traffic congestion during the morning peak hours, however, led to the introduction of an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantry near the Tanjong Rhu Flyover in the direction towards the city, one of the first two gantries to be set up in the country, which came into operation on 1 April 1998 together with the other gantry at Ophir Road. The ERP gantry price was increased to $6 in 2013 and reduced significantly when the MCE opened but decommissioned on 6 April 2020.

A decommissioned emergency highway strip was built in the long, straight section of the ECP close to Changi Airport. This section can be easily identified by removable potted plants instead of the standard large trees on the median strip. However, the highway strip has never been used for emergency landing purposes.

To facilitate the development of the new downtown, the ECP was truncated after the Benjamin Sheares Bridge, with the stretch at Marina South area realigned and converted to a major arterial road called Sheares Avenue. In the westbound direction, a new expressway called the Marina Coastal Expressway, was built to connect the ECP to the Ayer Rajah Expressway.

<text>Barynya is a fast Russian folk dance and music. The origins of the Barynya dance developed in the Eurasian region of the Central Russian Upland. The word &quot;barynya&quot; (Russian: Барыня, landlady) was used in Old Russian or Rus&#x27; lands as a form of addressing to a woman of higher class, literally when translated means “landlady”, a feminine form for the word &quot;barin&quot;, landlord. The Barynya dance is an alternation of chastushkas and frenetic dancing. Originally the dancing was without special choreography. The main characteristics of the Barynya dance are traditional elements of Russian folk dance like Russian squatting, rotations, jumps and sprited stomping. The main instruments of Baryna are Balalaika and Garmon.

The Barynya chastushkas used to have the refrain, kind of &quot;Барыня, барыня, сударыня-барыня&quot;, &quot;Barynya, barynya, sudarynya-barynya&quot;, or &quot;Барыня ты моя, сударыня ты моя&quot;. The content was often humoristic, even lewd.

There are a number of scenic, more refined versions of the dance.

A number of Russian folkloric dance ensembles bear the name.

<text>Robert Vance Isaac (August 1, 1932 – August 14, 1977) was an American stock car racing driver. Isaac made his first NASCAR appearance in 1961, and quickly forged a reputation of one of the toughest competitors of the 1960s and 1970s. He was most famously associated with driving Nord Krauskopf&#x27;s red No. 71 K&amp;K Insurance Dodge Charger. Isaac was NASCAR&#x27;s Grand National Series champion in 1970. Isaac abruptly retired from full-time top-level competition in 1973 and died of a heart attack during a late model race at Hickory Motor Speedway in 1977. For his achievements, Isaac was named as one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers and inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Isaac grew up on a farm near Catawba, North Carolina, the second-youngest of nine children. He finished school after the sixth grade, which led to the incorrect rumor that he could neither read nor write.

==NASCAR career==

He began racing full-time in 1956, but it took him seven years to break into the Grand National division. Isaac won the championship in 1970 driving the No. 71 Dodge Charger Daytona sponsored by K&amp;K Insurance. His crew chief was Harry Hyde. Isaac and Hyde took the car to Talladega in November and set a closed-course speed record.

Isaac won 37 races in NASCAR&#x27;s top series during his career, including 11 in his championship season, and started from the pole position 49 times. Isaac currently holds the NASCAR record for most poles in a single season, with 20 in 1969. In 1970 he turned a 201.104 mph lap at Talladega, a record that stood until 1983.

Isaac dropped out of the 1973 Talladega 500 mid-race in an impulsive decision which surprised his pit crew and the team owner. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t afraid I was going to wreck...I don&#x27;t have anything to prove to myself or to anybody else. I know how it feels to win and lose. I know how it feels to be a champion. And now I know how it feels to quit. It just entered my mind at that moment,&quot; Isaac said. &quot;I decided to quit and that was that. (Team owner) Bud Moore didn&#x27;t know I had quit until after the race. I didn&#x27;t know about (Larry) Smith at that time.&quot; (Larry Smith was the first fatality at Talladega Superspeedway, which happened earlier in the race). Isaac did not participate in any further 1973 NASCAR Winston Cup races after Talladega, and the presumption by sports commentators in late 1973 was that he was retiring from the sport.

Ultimately, Isaac did return to NASCAR racing as a driver from 1974 through 1976, on a reduced schedule.

==Land speed records==
Isaac also made his mark outside of NASCAR. In September 1971, he went to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and set 28 world speed records, some of which still stand.

==Awards==
Bobby Isaac was inducted into the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame in 1979, and the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1996. In 1998 NASCAR honored Isaac as one of its 50 greatest drivers. On May 20, 2015, Isaac was announced as a member of the 2016 induction class to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

==Death==
On Saturday night, August 13, 1977, while running fourth, Isaac pulled out of the Winston 200 late model sportsman race at Hickory Motor Speedway with 40 laps left, and called for a relief driver, collapsing on pit road of heat exhaustion. Weather reports for the area that day showed temperatures which had reached at mid-afternoon, and were still around at the time of Isaac&#x27;s collapse. Though Isaac was revived briefly at the hospital and was conversing with friends, he later died from a heart attack caused by heat exhaustion, at 12:45 a.m. on August 14, 13 days after his 45th birthday.

Details of Isaac&#x27;s pit lane collapse on the night of his death were given to reporters by friend and former racing driver Ned Jarrett. Jarrett asserted at that time that the reason Isaac left the 1973 Talladega 500 was because he &quot;had heard a voice that told him to quit&quot;.

<text>The Lightning Seeds (also known as Lightning Seeds) are an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1989 by Ian Broudie (vocals, guitar, producer), formerly of the bands Big in Japan, Care, and Original Mirrors. Originally a studio-based solo project for Broudie, the Lightning Seeds expanded into a touring band following &quot;Jollification&quot; (1994). The group experienced commercial success throughout the 1990s and are well known for their single &quot;Three Lions&quot;, a collaboration with David Baddiel and Frank Skinner which reached No. 1 in the UK in 1996 and 2018, with a re-worked version also reaching the top spot in 1998.

==History==
===1989–1993: Formation and early years===
Prior to the forming his own project, Ian Broudie had been a member of the 1970s post-punk band Big in Japan and the new wave bands Original Mirrors and Care. By the late 1980s, Broudie was better known as a producer than as a musician, and had produced albums for new wave and alternative rock artists such as Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Wall of Voodoo and the Fall.

In 1989, Broudie began recording alone under the name &quot;Lightning Seeds&quot;. The name derives from a misheard lyric from Prince&#x27;s 1985 hit single &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, in which Prince sings the line &quot;thunder drowns out what the lightning sees&quot;. Broudie performed all vocals and instruments on the band&#x27;s first album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Cloudcuckooland&quot;, which he also produced. The Lightning Seeds achieved success with their debut single, the psychedelic hit &quot;Pure&quot;, which reached the top 20 in the UK, and the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Both &quot;Pure&quot; and followup single &quot;All I Want&quot; also reached the Modern Rock Tracks top 10.

Broudie resumed his production career after the success of the first Lightning Seeds album, but returned to songwriting in 1991 and moved labels from Rough Trade to Virgin. He then resumed his Lightning Seeds recording career, drafting Simon Rogers as his studio partner in production, arrangements, and instrumentation. Rogers, who had also helped with programming on the first Lightning Seeds album, would continue as Broudie&#x27;s in-studio partner throughout the rest of the Lightning Seeds&#x27; career.

The album &quot;Sense&quot; (1992) featured the song &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, written by Broudie for his son, which reached No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. An instrumental version of the song later became better known as the BBC TV theme for the &quot;Goal of the Month&quot; competition. The album &quot;Sense&quot; would mark Broudie&#x27;s first Lightning Seeds songwriting collaborations with former Specials singer Terry Hall.

=== 1994–1998: Touring years ===
Broudie signed the Lightning Seeds to Epic Records, put other projects on hold and embarked on a touring schedule: 

By the end of 1993 Broudie had finished the &quot;Jollification&quot; (1994) album, which included contributions from Terry Hall, Alison Moyet and Ian McNabb. The promotional tour began in August 1994 with a consistently changing line up over the years with Broudie the only constant. The tour benefitted from the success of the second single from the album, &quot;Change&quot;, which reached No. 13 in the UK Singles Charts, becoming the band&#x27;s second UK top 20 hit. The song was also featured on the soundtrack for the hit movie Clueless. The album &quot;Jollification&quot; became a critical success and the singles taken from this album, &quot;Lucky You&quot;, &quot;Marvellous&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; made noticeable impact. Mark Farrow&#x27;s album cover featured the use of computer graphics to create an enormous strawberry, its seeds depicted with superimposed human faces, while the singles&#x27; covers featured different variations on this theme.

During this period a number of songs were recorded at a private river barge studio located at Eel Pie Studios, then owned by Pete Townshend for the fourth studio album &quot;Dizzy Heights&quot;. The single &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was released ahead of the album and reached No. 20 in the UK Singles chart.

In 1996 The Football Association commissioned Broudie to write an England song for the upcoming Euro &#x27;96 football tournament. Broudie agreed on the condition that comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, who had presented the late-night television show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot; participated. The resulting song, &quot;Three Lions&quot;, became a No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and was adopted as a football chant, not only in the UK but also in countries such as Germany, where the single and accompanying video reached No. 16 in their charts.

In 1997 Lightning Seeds headlined the Hillsborough Justice Concert, which was held at the Liverpool Anfield stadium to raise fund for the families in their struggle for justice.

During this period the band achieved three more UK Top 20 hits, including a cover version of the Turtles&#x27; &quot;You Showed Me&quot;, which became their highest-charting hit other than &quot;Three Lions&quot; when it reached No. 8. 

1997 gave the Lightning Seeds international exposure with &quot;You Showed Me&quot; included on the &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; soundtrack. The release of greatest hits compilation &quot;Like You Do... Best of The Lightning Seeds&quot; and a UK promotional tour followed. In 1998, Broudie, Baddiel &amp; Skinner reworked and recorded an updated version of their hit football anthem for the FIFA World Cup in France. &quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first song to top the charts on two occasions with different sets of lyrics. In 1998, the Lightning Seeds also performed on the Main Stage at both the Glastonbury Festival and the V Festival in the UK.

===1999–2005: &quot;Tilt&quot; and hiatus===
Their album &quot;Tilt&quot; (1999) was dance-oriented and featured collaborations with Stephen Jones. The single &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; was heralded by BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as &quot;one of the band&#x27;s strongest singles to date&quot; and rose to No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart.

===2006–present===
The band&#x27;s second greatest hits album &quot;The Very Best of the Lightning Seeds&quot; was released on 12 June 2006, followed by the re-release of &quot;Three Lions&quot;, which rose to No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. 

In 2009, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Four Winds,&quot; and returned to touring in April 2010 after a ten-year hiatus.

In 2014, the songs and career of Ian Broudie were celebrated in a concert held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, featuring the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra and performances by Ian McCulloch (Echo And The Bunnymen), Miles Kane (the Last Shadow Puppets), Terry Hall (the Specials), James Skelly (the Coral) and Broudie himself with a band featuring musicians Sean Payne (the Zutons), Bill Ryder Jones and Nick Power (the Coral) and Broudie&#x27;s son, Riley. The event was filmed but is yet to be released.

On 22 August 2014, the Lightning Seeds were joined by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Liverpool&#x27;s Sefton Park for a show in front of 30,000 people, reprising the Philharmonic show without the special guests.

In December 2016, the Lightning Seeds supported Madness on their British pre-Christmas arena tour.

In June 2018, the single &quot;Three Lions&quot; re-entered the UK chart and reached number one on the chart dated 19 July 2018, celebrating the progress of England national football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s coming home&quot; featuring heavily on social media and television.

A new single, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, was released on 15 June 2022. Alongside the new song &quot;Emily Smiles&quot; it was taken from the studio album &quot;See You in the Stars&quot;, which was released in October 2022.

In 2023, the Lightning Seeds opened the Glastonbury Festival&#x27;s &quot;Other Stage&quot;. They also supported Madness on tour once again that year.

<doc id="984092" wikidata="Q7693508" url="?curid=984092" title="Ted McMeekin">
<text>Ted McMeekin (born ) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He is the Ward 15 Councillor, for the City of Hamilton. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2000 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale and Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne.

==Background==
McMeekin completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in social work at McMaster University and his master&#x27;s degree in social work from Wilfrid Laurier University. He has served as executive director of the Burlington Social Planning Council, and was for a time the chair of part-time studies at Mohawk College (where he also taught courses). He has also worked on social justice issues for the United Church of Canada, and was the owner and operator of a small bookstore for eight years.

==Municipal politics==
Before entering provincial politics, McMeekin was a member of the Hamilton, Ontario City Council representing Ward 7 (Hamilton Mountain). After retiring from Council, he moved to Flamborough, Ontario, a rural community which lies on the outskirts of Hamilton, and later served a term of six years as mayor. McMeekin was also for a number of years Flamborough&#x27;s representative on the Hamilton-Wentworth regional council, which the provincial government of Mike Harris eliminated in 2000 by amalgamating the city and outlying regions into a single political entity. McMeekin was one of the most vocal opponents of this change, noting that it would result in a loss of autonomy for Flamborough. On October 24, 2022, McMeekin returned to municipal politics, after winning a five person race to win a seat on Hamilton City Council in Ward 15.

==Provincial politics==
McMeekin&#x27;s plans to jump from municipal to provincial politics had been rumoured for years, and it came as no surprise when he won the Liberal nomination for a by-election to be held in ADFA on September 7, 2000 (called following the resignation of Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Toni Skarica, another vocal opponent of the amalgamation scheme). Although the seat had gone overwhelmingly for the Progressive Conservatives the previous year, McMeekin defeated PC candidate Priscilla de Villiers by over 9,000 votes. The Conservatives had spent $211,989 on his competitor, nearly $80,000 in excess of McMeekin&#x27;s $132,143. Local opposition to amalgamation was generally cited as the reason for this shift.

In the provincial election of 2003, McMeekin defeated Tory candidate Mark Mullins by a somewhat reduced margin. He served as parliamentary assistant to John Gerretsen in his capacity as the minister responsible for seniors from October 23, 2003, to September 27, 2004. On September 27, 2004, he was appointed assistant to Jim Watson, the Ministry of Consumer and Business Services.

In the provincial election of 2007, McMeekin defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Chris Corrigan. On October 30, 2007, McMeekin was named a cabinet minister, responsible for Government and Consumer Services. He was re-elected in 2011 and appointed Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

In 2013, McMeekin supported Kathleen Wynne in her bid to become Liberal leader. After Wynne won, she named McMeekin to her first cabinet as Minister of Community and Social Services.

McMeekin was re-elected in 2014. Shortly after the election, Wynne appointed McMeekin as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. He resigned from his post in June 2016 to help create gender parity in the cabinet. McMeekin was defeated in the 2018 election, where he placed third.

<text>Harold Arthur &quot;Hal&quot; Fowler (January 12, 1927 – November 7, 2000) was an American poker player known for winning the 1979 World Series of Poker Main Event. He is considered the first amateur poker player to become poker&#x27;s World Champion.

Fowler was born in Rutland (city), Vermont and later lived for many years in Tulare, California. Before his WSOP victory, he worked as an advertising executive.

==Poker==
Although he was a relative unknown amateur player, Fowler won the 1979 World Series of Poker Main Event. At one point in the tournament, he was down to around 2,000 in chips (out of over 500,000 total tournament chips) at a final table that included Johnny Moss, Bobby Baldwin, Bobby Hoff, and other professional players. Additionally, it is believed that Fowler could not cover the entrance fee and Benny Binion had to loan it to him. Fowler&#x27;s 1979 win is sometimes called the greatest upset in the history of the WSOP.

Fowler defeated professional Bobby Hoff heads up to win the championship when his made a gut-shot straight and defeated Hoff&#x27;s on a board reading .

Fowler later faded from the poker scene because of complications from diabetes that hurt his eyesight and his legs. 

Fowler&#x27;s career tournament earnings exceeded $380,000.

He died at the age of 73 of hemorrhagic shock due to upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, after having been driven to the hospital by a friend on November 7, 2000. He had been living in a seniors housing complex and was experiencing symptoms of a duodenal ulcer and cirrhosis.

<doc id="984102" wikidata="Q3566032" url="?curid=984102" title="Nova Peris">
<text>Nova Maree Peris (born 25 February 1971) is an Aboriginal Australian athlete and former politician. As part of the Australian women&#x27;s field hockey (Hockeyroos) team at the 1996 Olympic Games, she was the first Aboriginal Australian to win an Olympic gold medal. She later switched sports to sprinting and went to the 1998 Commonwealth Games and 2000 Olympic Games. She was elected to the Australian Senate at the 2013 federal election, after then Prime Minister Julia Gillard named her as a &quot;captain&#x27;s pick&quot;, installing her as the preselected Labor candidate over incumbent Labor senator Trish Crossin. She retired from the Senate in 2016.

== Early life and education ==
Peris was born in Darwin, Northern Territory. Her biological father was Indigenous rights activist John Christophersen, although she had no contact with him between the ages of 2 and 16. Her mother, Joan, had been removed from her own mother, and raised in the Catholic mission on Melville Island, as one of the Stolen Generations. She lived with her family in a Housing Commission unit in Fannie Bay, an inner northern suburb; though her family descends from the Gija people people of East Kimberley, the Yawuru people of West Kimberley and the Muran Clan of the Iwatja people of West Arnhem Land. She is said to have frequently ran away from school, with sport being her main interest. At age 13, she gave ups athletics when she was selected for the national schoolgirl hockey team.

==Sporting career==

Peris was chosen for the Australian Women&#x27;s Hockey Team, the Hockeyroos, in 1992. By that time she already had a young daughter, Jessica. She remained in this highly successful team until 1996 when they won the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games.

Peris was a representative in the Australian Women&#x27;s Hockey team at the 1996 Summer Olympics, becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win an Olympic gold medal. In 1997, she switched sports and a year later she became a double gold medalist in the 1998 Commonwealth Games (Kuala Lumpur) winning the 200m sprint with a time of 22.77 seconds and sharing in Australia&#x27;s 4 × 100 metres relay win. Peris was named Young Australian of the Year in 1997.

Peris continued to represent Australia on the athletics track, running over 200 metres at the 1999 World Athletics Championships and 400 metres at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She made the Olympic semi-finals in her individual event and ran in the Australian 4 × 400 metres relay team, which made the final, finishing fifth.

In the Olympic year of 2000, a portrait of her was hung in the Sporting Archibald Prize, painted by Glenda Jones.

In 2005, she sold her Olympic memorabilia to the National Museum of Australia for $140,000. It included her gold medal, hockey stick, Sydney Olympic torch and the running shoes she wore in the Sydney Olympics.

==Political career==

On 22 January 2013 the Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced she would invite Peris to join the Australian Labor Party and stand as a candidate for the Senate in the Northern Territory at the 2013 election. On 29 January 2013 her preselection was endorsed by the ALP executive 19 votes to 2, meaning her name was placed first on the ALP&#x27;s senate ticket in the Northern Territory, supporting the likelihood that she would become Australia&#x27;s first female Indigenous federal parliamentarian.

On 7 September 2013 Peris became Australia&#x27;s first Indigenous woman elected to federal parliament. Peris was sworn into parliament on 12 November, and noted the apology to the stolen generation in her maiden speech.

The &quot;Northern Territory News&quot; obtained, what they claimed were private emails of now Senator Peris, in October 2014. The newspaper claimed she was conducting an affair with another athlete, and had had sought government funding to arrange a trip together. No evidence was ever produced for the allegations and claims about hacked emails were later dismissed by Federal Police.

Peris announced on 24 May 2016 that she would not nominate to re-contest her Senate seat at the 2016 federal election. Fairfax and the ABC reported that Peris was one of the frontrunners being considered to replace Jason Mifsud as head of diversity for the Australian Football League (AFL). Malarndirri McCarthy announced on 25 May 2016 that she had been invited by Labor to nominate herself as Peris&#x27; Senate replacement and that she would do so. Nova Peris&#x27;s Senate term ended at the double dissolution of 9 May 2016.

==Post political life==
Although she has left Parliamentary politics, Peris has stayed involved in several high-level political causes, such as the 2023 Voice to Paraliament referendum. In speeches and in an opinion piece, she argued the reform would include Indigenous Australians in national life more. In 2023, she was one of several high-profile Indigenous Australians calling for reparations.

She is a strong advocate for education. In 2012 she became the founder and Patron of the Nova Peris Girls&#x27; Academy at St Johns Catholic College, in Darwin. Peris is an Ambassador for the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation.

Peris has actively supported the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) since 1999, serving as one of its two Deputy Chairs by 2022, and its co-chair from March 2023. However, by May 2024, she had resigned from the role, saying it had become untenable whilst co-chair, footballer and human rights activist Craig Foster, was making &quot;inaccurate and divisive public statements&quot; regarding Israel and Gaza. She has been a vocal supporter of Israel, of the Australian Jewish Community, and has been recently noted for her public advocacy against antisemitism. Peris also argued that the Australian Aboriginal flag has been &quot;misappropriated&quot; by Palestine supporters in the Israel–Hamas war protests, a claim challenged by indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe and indigenous academic Chelsea Watego, who noted the history of Aboriginal-Palestinian solidarity in the framework of understanding settler colonialism. In a 2024 interview with Sky News Australia, she defended her decision to resign from ARM by saying:&quot;I have a duty I feel as an Aboriginal person who has always stood against all forms of racial discrimination, and I hate the rise of anti-Semitism in this country and I feel for the Jewish people and everyone who has been affected...&quot;Peris told the &quot;Times of Israel&quot; that she could not &quot;just sit back and see young Jewish kids being attacked the way that they are&quot;.

<doc id="984106" wikidata="Q4776855" url="?curid=984106" title="Antonio Paoli">
<text>Antonio Paoli (14 April 1871 – 24 August 1946) was a Puerto Rican tenor. At the height of his fame, he was known as &quot;The King of Tenors and The Tenor of Kings.&quot; He is considered to be the first Puerto Rican to reach international fame in the musical arts. Paoli has been recognized as &quot;one of the most outstanding opera singers of all time,&quot; and as one who had &quot;one of the most lyric and powerful voices...superior even to his contemporary rival, Enrico Caruso.&quot;

After spending his childhood in his birth city of Ponce, Paoli moved to Spain where, with the assistance of his well-connected sister Amalia, he obtained a royal scholarship to take singing lessons in Italy. After singing to standing ovation crowds in both Spain and Italy, Paoli made his grand debut in Paris, France, where he was encouraged to perform on the highest levels of the world stage. Before the end of the 19th century and while Paoli was still in his twenties, he went on a tour of Europe that earned him both popular acclaim, and imperial honors from princes, kings, and emperors.

Between 1900 and 1914 his career skyrocketed, with performances not only in Europe but also in the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. He performed in Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, New York, Buenos Aires, Havana, Santiago, Milan, Rome, Naples, Barcelona, and Vienna.

When World War I forced the closure of all European opera houses, Paoli made his living as a professional boxer. Unfortunately, he also lost his singing voice during this period. After the War ended, following medical advice and performing vocal exercises, Paoli regained his voice and returned to the international stage, in all the glory of days past. He performed in Europe, North and South America, and finally settled with his sister Amalia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she had opened a singing school.

Paoli spent the last 20 years of his life teaching voice and singing in San Juan, while also working for the establishment of a music conservatory in that city. He would not see this last dream come true, because he developed cancer and died at age 75. He was buried in San Juan, but his remains were later transferred to a mausoleum at Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro in his birth city of Ponce.

==Early years==

Paoli (birth name: Antonio Emilio Paoli y Marcano ) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He was the son of Amalia Marcano Intriago, of Spanish ancestry, who was born on the island of Margarita, Venezuela, and of Domingo Paoli Marcatentti, a Corsican immigrant. Antonio Paoli&#x27;s parents met in Caracas, and immediately fell in love. But Amalia&#x27;s father, a rich landlord, opposed their relationship because of class differences. The young couple escaped to the Dominican Republic without getting married and later returned to Puerto Rico. They established themselves in the city of Yauco and lived there for several years. Later they moved to Ponce, into a house given to them by Amalia&#x27;s aunt, Teresa Intriago. It was located on Calle Mayor (Mayor Street), House No. 14. Paoli had two notable sisters, Olivia Paoli (1855–1942), who was a suffragist and Amalia Paoli (1861–1941), a notable opera soprano who together with her sister joined the Suffragist Social League and fought for the rights of Puerto Rican women.

Ponce at the time was the financial and cultural capital of the island, and an ideal place to Paoli&#x27;s development.

When Paoli was young, his parents would often take him to operas at Ponce&#x27;s La Perla Theater located a block from their residence. They saw a performance of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, sung by Italian tenor, Pietro Baccei. At that moment, Paoli decided what he wanted to become. His parents were very supportive of his ambition and guided him on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of &quot;voice&quot; directed by Ramon Marin. His sister Amalia was a soprano who performed at La Perla in Emilio Arrieta&#x27;s opera, &quot;Marina.&quot; In 1883, when Paoli was only 12 years old, both his parents died. He traveled to Spain to live with his sister Amalia and study music and opera.

==Debut==
Amalia was taking singing classes under Napoleon Verger. She was under the patronage of Isabel de Borbón, Princess of Asturias and sister of the King of Spain, Alfonso XII, In 1884, Amalia helped Paoli to obtain two scholarships from her Majesty Queen María Cristina, Queen Regent of Spain. Paoli started his studies at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial. He entered Toledo&#x27;s Military Academy and in 1892 graduated with honors. He was assigned to the Queen&#x27;s escort and named personal custodian and guard of the child King Alfonso XIII. Paoli wanted to continue singing and in 1897 went to study at the Academia de Canto La Scala in Milan, Italy. On 26 April 1899, he made his debut in Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;William Tell&quot; in Paris, France. Paris newspapers commented on Paoli&#x27;s success and said, &quot;We should declare Paoli the Tenor of France.&quot;

==World tours==
Between 1900 and 1914, Paoli performed in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia. He performed in Italy, Luxembourg and in the United Kingdom, with performances in London, Scotland, Edinburgh, and Brighton, closing the year with concerts in Corsica (his father&#x27;s homeland) and Turkey. In 1900, he married Josephine Vetiska, an Austrian, in Vienna.

From 1901 to 1902, Paoli performed in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the United States. Paoli purchased a villa in Porto Cereso, Lugano, Italy, where his son Antonio Arnaldo was born. After singing for King Alfonso XII and the royal family in Spain, Paoli returned to the United States and sang in various cities, among them New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Albany, Providence, Grand Rapids, New London, Detroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Chicago.

In 1905, Paoli performed at the Grand Theatre du Conservatoire in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Tsar of Russia Nicholas II was present during one of the performances. After inviting Paoli to perform at the royal Winter Palace, he awarded Paoli The Cross of St. Mauricio medal and bestowed upon him the title &quot;Cammer Sanger&quot; (Chamber Singer).

On 5 September 1907, Paoli held a private recital for Pope Pius X at the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. That same year he was named as a &quot;Singer of the Royal Court&quot; by William II of Germany. Paoli was the first operatic artist to record an entire opera when he participated in a performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy. He was selected in 1907 as the First Tenor in the main character, by a team of engineers and musicians which included Leoncavallo. The recording was arranged in the following manner; the musicians were placed at the end of the recording room and the back-up singers in a semi-arc in front of the gramophone, while Paoli stood alone away from the gramophone.

Paoli continued to perform around the world: in Greece, Palestine, Poland, Egypt, Spain and Italy, where he established his permanent residence. In 1910, the singer was signed as the First Tenor by La Scala, Milan, the most prestigious opera company in the world at the time. Paoli received a contract to inaugurate Teatro Colón, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he sang &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Di quella pira&quot;. He also performed in Russia, Poland, Egypt, Hungary, Belgium, Cuba, Chile, Haiti, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Canada, and the United States.

==Boxing career==

By 1914, just before the start of World War I, Paoli lost his voice and all of the major opera houses in Europe were shut down. Paoli moved to Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, leaving his Italian properties unattended. By 1915, Paoli was without economic means as a result of his bad investments.

In order to make a living, Paoli became a professional boxer. After a period of training in Spain, he moved to England to start his new &quot;career.&quot; He was undefeated in his first five fights. He broke his right wrist on his sixth challenge, which ended his boxing career.

Paoli sold his properties in Italy and acquired a small country house in Spain. He stayed for a few months with his brother Carlos in the Philippines. Paoli was medically treating his vocal cords, but observers believed that his opera career was over. He continued his singing exercises with his sister Amalia, who had moved into his house in Spain.

==Comeback==
In January 1917, Paoli returned to the stage and performed the opera &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; at the Constanzi Theater in Rome. Elvira de Hidalgo, who later became the singing coach of Maria Callas, recalled:

Paoli kept busy performing in Italy, South America, and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, his sister Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) where she was running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some note that Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.

==Last years==
Even with this busy agenda, Paoli&#x27;s financial situation remained strained. After living in New York City for almost the entire year of 1927, Paoli decided to return to Puerto Rico to live and work with his sister Amalia, and give voice lessons at the Academia Paoli. Paoli also helped produce &quot;Othello&quot; at the Municipal Theater in San Juan.

For the next two decades Paoli&#x27;s main concern was teaching at the Paoli Academy with Amalia. In 1928, the tenor performed Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; in its entirety for the last time in San Juan. This was his last performance on stage. It took place at the San Juan Municipal Theater, known today as the Tapia Theater.

In 1935, the government of Puerto Rico named the San Juan Municipal Theater in his honor, changing its name to &quot;Teatro Paoli.&quot; In 1929, his wife Josephine died and a year later he married Adelaida Bonini, from Rimini, Italy. He affectionately called her &quot;Adina&quot;. He gave his last singing performance in 1942, while commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of his sister, Amalia Paoli. The service was conducted at the Chapel of the University of the Sacred Heart (Santurce).

Paoli died of prostate cancer, in San Juan on 24 August 1946, and was buried in the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico. On 13 April 2005, Paoli&#x27;s remains, and those of his (second) wife Adina Bonini (who had died in May 1978) were exhumed and reinterred in Ponce&#x27;s Román Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon and buried by the base of his statue. The bust of Paoli at the Pantheon&#x27;s rotunda is the work of Puerto Rican sculptor Gladys Nieves.

==Honors, accolades, and legacy==
Antonio Paoli was the first Puerto Rican to gain international recognition in the performing arts. He gave 1,725 performances between 1888 and 1942, and interpreted Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; 575 times. To his credit, Paoli was also the first opera singer in the world to record an entire opera; he was part of a recorded performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Italy in 1907.
As early as 1904, Paoli was awarded The Cross of St. Mauricio medal by the Tsar of Russia Nicholas II, and María Cristina de Habsburgo, Queen of Spain, declared Paoli &quot;Cantante de Cámara de la Corte&quot; (Chamber Singer of the Court) and gave him &quot;La Gran Cruz de Isabel la Católica&quot; (The Cross of Isabella the Catholic), while Carlos de Braganza, Prince of Portugal, named him &quot;Caballero Comendador del Cristo de Portugal y Cantante de Cámara&quot;. Just two years later, in 1906, the same title of &quot;Cammer Sanger&quot; (Chamber Singer of the Court) was given to Paoli by Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria, and in 1907 he was decorated by Carlos I of Braganza.

In 1909, Paoli received &quot;La Cruz de Alfonso II&quot; from Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, and was declared ’&#x27;Honor Singer of the Vatican&#x27;’ by Pope Pius X. In 1910, he was honored with the title of &quot;Hijo Predilecto de España&quot; (Favorite Son of Spain), while in 1911, Wilhelm II, Kaiser of Germany, declared Paoli ’&#x27;Kammer Sanger of the Empire&#x27;’, and in 1912, Paoli received a protocol-breaking standing ovation from the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph when Paoli sang &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in Vienna. In 1920, the tenor was knighted by Vittorio Emmanuelle III, King of Italy, making him &quot;Cavaliere De La Corona Italiana and Commendatore Dell Popolo Romano&quot; (Knight of the Italian Crown and Commandant of the Roman People).

Though he did not see it happen during his lifetime, Puerto Rico also built the Music Conservatory, something for which Paoli had worked so hard to establish. This dream was finally realized shortly after his death. At the &quot;Centro de Bellas Artes&quot; in San Juan there is also a 1,883-seat &quot;Antonio Paoli Festival Hall.&quot; San Juan&#x27;s Municipal Theater was also renamed Teatro Paoli in his honor in 1935. In recognition of his fame and talent, the government of Puerto Rico also awarded Paoli a pension in 1934.
In 1983, the non-profit &quot;Paoli Award&quot; was created. This award honors the effort, work, and success of outstanding professionals in the various arts and media, including music and recording, television, radio, written communication, fashion, and beauty. Originally designated to recognize the outstanding achievements of Puerto Ricans, the Paoli Award has branched out internationally, and since 1992 it also includes Hispanics and Latin Americans from around the world.

On 9 October 2009, the Government of the United States listed Casa Paoli in Antonio Paoli&#x27;s hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The house, Antonio&#x27;s childhood house in Puerto Rico, is Paoli&#x27;s only remaining residencial structure in Puerto Rico.

Among other honors bestowed on Paoli after his death are a music school named in his honor (&quot;Escuela Libre de Música Antonio Paoli&quot;), in the city of Caguas, Puerto Rico, and in his hometown of Ponce, there is a theater at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, Ponce named in his memory, &quot;Teatro Paoli&quot;.

Paoli has also been the subject of many books written about his life and influence. Included is the work by Emilio J. Pasarell titled &quot;Orígenes y desarrollo de la afición teatral en Puerto Rico&quot; (Origins and development of the theatrical pursuit in Puerto Rico) where he describes the life of Paoli in detail.

<text>Ian Zachary Broudie (born 4 August 1958) is an English musician and singer-songwriter from Liverpool. After emerging from the post-punk scene in Liverpool in the late 1970s as a member of Big in Japan, Broudie went on to produce albums (sometimes under the name Kingbird) for artists including Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the Fall, the Coral, the Zutons and the Subways.

Around 1989, he began writing and recording under the name Lightning Seeds, releasing the album &quot;Cloudcuckooland&quot; through Rough Trade on the independent label Ghetto Records, eventually putting together a live touring band in 1994. The Lightning Seeds achieved great commercial success during much of the 1990s. In 2004, Broudie released an album titled &quot;Tales Told&quot; under his own name. The Lightning Seeds reformed in 2006 and released their sixth studio album &quot;Four Winds&quot; in 2009. A seventh album, &quot;See You in the Stars&quot;, was released in 2022.

==Early life and career==
Ian Broudie was born into an Orthodox Jewish family. He played in Liverpool&#x27;s fledgling punk scene in the 1970s. He was a member of the band Big in Japan, with Holly Johnson and Bill Drummond. He was also a founder member of John Peel favourites Original Mirrors in the early 1980s, and was credited as a member of Bette Bright and the Illuminations on their lone album from 1981. In 1983, he recorded and wrote tracks under the name Care with vocalist Paul Simpson; the duo released three singles, including the minor UK chart hit &quot;Flaming Sword&quot;.

==The Lightning Seeds==

Broudie began writing as the Lightning Seeds at the end of the 1980s, scoring a debut hit with the song &quot;Pure&quot;. The Lightning Seeds had just one member: Broudie.

The Lightning Seeds produced a selection of well-received singles and albums in the 1990s. The albums &quot;Cloudcuckooland&quot; (1990) and &quot;Sense&quot; (1992) followed. The latter&#x27;s song &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; became the backing music for &quot;Match of the Day&quot;&#x27;s Goal of the Month competition. In 1994 Broudie created a touring band so the songs could be played live. Their 1994 album &quot;Jollification&quot; is considered by many as the moment the Lightning Seeds arrived as a mainstream band. During the same period, Broudie produced albums for other acts, including Northside, The Primitives, Terry Hall and Dodgy.

The Lightning Seeds twice took football anthem &quot;Three Lions&quot; (with comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel) to number one, with different lyrics for the Euro 96 and France &#x27;98 tournaments (Broudie himself is a supporter of Liverpool; Lightning Seeds album covers and inlays often contain references such as Justice for the 96 and Support the Liverpool Dockers). In the years since France &#x27;98, the song has been released multiple times for football tournaments, and now has the unique distinction of being the only song in existence to have become UK No. 1 four separate times with the same artists: two one-week stints in 1996, three straight weeks in 1998 for the remake, and again in 2018 for the original during the World Cup held in Russia.

On 13 December 1996 and 14 March 1997, Broudie was the guest host of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Later that year, the Lightning Seeds headlined the Hillsborough Justice Concert, which was held at Liverpool&#x27;s Anfield stadium to raise fund for the families in their struggle for justice.

Broudie returned with a new line-up in 2009, releasing the album &quot;Four Winds&quot;, and has extensively toured since with a line-up including old Seeds favourites Angie Pollack (piano), Martyn Campbell (guitar), and Ian&#x27;s son Riley Broudie (guitar).

In 2021, Broudie said he was working on a new Lighting Seeds album.

==Production work==
Broudie worked as a producer with many independent labels including Factory Records, Creation Records, Zoo Records and Rough Trade, sometimes under the name &#x27;Kingbird&#x27;.

Broudie subsequently concentrated on production for other bands, working with the Coral, the Subways, the Zutons, French rock band Noir Desir for their first long album &quot;Veuillez rendre l&#x27;âme&quot;, the Rifles, on an early single by Sleeper and on a handful of I Am Kloot songs.

==Solo career==
On 11 October 2004, Broudie released his debut solo effort, &quot;Tales Told&quot;, embraced by critics and fans alike despite the fact that &quot;Tales Told&quot; saw Broudie move into folk rock territory and away from the slick pop sound of the Lightning Seeds. The first song on the album, &quot;Song for No One&quot;, was featured in the opening episode of the third season of the TV series &quot;The O.C.&quot;

==Solo discography==
===Albums and EPs===
* &quot;Tales Told&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Smoke Rings EP&quot; (2005)

==Personal==
Broudie lives in London but spends a substantial amount of time writing and recording in Liverpool as his studio is located there. In 2018, he said he was recording in his home. He has a son, fellow Lightning Seeds member Riley Broudie (b. 1991), who was the inspiration for the band&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;.

Broudie published his memoir, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Here Today&quot;, in 2023.

<doc id="984115" wikidata="Q726231" url="?curid=984115" title="Molidae">
<text>The Molidae comprise the family of the molas or ocean sunfishes, unusual fish whose bodies come to an end just behind the dorsal and anal fins, giving them a &quot;half-fish&quot; appearance. They are also the largest of the ray-finned bony fish, with the southern sunfish, &quot;Mola alexandrini&quot;, recorded at in length and in weight.

The family name comes from the ocean sunfish&#x27;s scientific name &quot;Mola mola&quot;, both its genus name and epithet come from the Latin word &quot;mola&quot; for &quot;millstone&quot; because of its circular shape.

== Description ==

Molidae have the fewest vertebrae of any fish, with only 16 in &quot;Mola mola&quot;. The axial musculature, caudal and pelvic fins are completely lost during development, and most of their skeleton is made of cartilage. They also lack swim bladders. No bony plates occur in the skin, which is, however, thick and dense like cartilage and is fairly rough. Under the skin there is a stiff and gelatinous layer consisting of 89.8% water with a collagen and elastin meshwork, acting like an exoskeleton. Due to its greasy texture, it may also contain lipids. This layer, which is horizontally separated by a septum, provides the fish with buoyancy, and makes up a larger part of the animal&#x27;s total mass the bigger the individual is.

Molids mostly swim by using their anal and dorsal fins; the pectoral fins are probably just stabilizers. To steer, they squirt a strong jet of water out of their mouths or gills. They can also make minor adjustments in the orientation of the anal fin or the dorsal fin so as to control the amount of force it produces and the angle at which the force is produced. In this respect, they use their fins much like a bird uses its wings.

Molids are said to be able to produce sound by grinding their pharyngeal teeth, which are long and claw-like. Typical of a member of Tetraodontiformes, their teeth are fused into a beak-like structure, making it impossible for them to close their mouths. Despite this, they feed mainly on soft-bodied animals, such as jellyfish and salps, although they also take small fish or crustaceans.

==Behavior==
Molids have been filmed interacting with other species. Since molids are susceptible to skin parasites, they make use of cleaner fish. A molid in need of cleaning will locate a patch of floating algae or flotsam that is home to halfmoons. The molid signals a readiness for cleaning by swimming almost vertically with its head near the surface of the water, and waits for the smaller cleaner fish to feed on the parasite worms. Similarly, the molid may break the surface of the water with its dorsal fin and beak to attract the attention of a gull or similar seabird. The seabird will then dig worms and other stubborn parasites out of the molid&#x27;s skin.

== Fossil record ==
The known fossil history of Molidae extends back to the Eocene, with the genus &quot;Eomola&quot; containing the species &quot;E. bimaxillaria&quot;, known from the mid/late Eocene (Bartonian) of the North Caucasus. The fossil genus &quot;Austromola&quot; containing one species, &quot;A. angerhoferi&quot; , is known from the Lower Miocene Ebelsberg Formation near Pucking, Austria. This species was a resident of the Paratethys Sea and is estimated to have reached a length around , making it the largest Cenozoic fossil teleost known.

At least one fossil species of &quot;Mola&quot;, &quot;M. pileata&quot; , is known from the Upper and Middle Miocene of Europe with a possible second species known from the Lower Miocene of North Carolina, United States. The genus &quot;Ranzania&quot; has five known fossil species: &quot;R. grahami&quot; and &quot;R. tenneyorum&quot; , both from the Middle Miocene Calvert Formation of Virginia, USA; &quot;R. zappai&quot; from the Middle Miocene of Italy; &quot;R. ogaii&quot; from the Middle Miocene of Japan; and an as yet unnamed species from the Upper Miocene of Algeria.

An Early Miocene-aged fossil molid beak (potentially of &quot;Ranzania&quot;) from the Gaiman Formation of Chubut, Argentina represents one of the southernmost known fossil records of tetraodontiform fish. Although it may have been a stray to the region, it is also possible that the warmer climate of the Miocene allowed molids to inhabit the seas that then covered Patagonia. In modern times, molids are only occasional strays to the region due to its cold climate.

== Species ==
Only five extant species in three extant genera are described:
* Ocean sunfish (&quot;Mola mola&quot;)
* Southern ocean sunfish (&quot;Mola alexandrini&quot;), has been recognized as a senior synonym of &quot;Mola ramsayi&quot; , the &quot;bump-head sunfish&quot;
* Hoodwinker sunfish (&quot;Mola tecta&quot;)
* Slender sunfish (&quot;Ranzania laevis&quot;)
* Sharptail mola (&quot;Masturus lanceolatus&quot;)

<doc id="984117" wikidata="Q4711630" url="?curid=984117" title="Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta">
<text>The Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta () was an Albertan autonomist, libertarian and conservative political party in Alberta, Canada.

The party was named the [[Alberta First Party]] () from 1999 to 2004, when it changed its name to the Separation Party of Alberta (). In 2013, it reverted to Alberta First. In April 2018, it became the Western Freedom Party of Alberta (). On June 22, 2018, it was announced that the Western Freedom Party had changed to its present name.

On April 27, 2020, the party announced plans to merge with Wexit Alberta and for a new party called the Wildrose Independence Party of Alberta. Members of both parties voted to approve the merger on June 29, 2020. In July 2020, Wildrose Independence Party of Alberta was officially registered with Elections Alberta, giving effect to the merger.

== MLAs ==
The party had one member, Derek Fildebrandt, in the Alberta Legislature prior to the 2019 Alberta general election.

== Beliefs ==
According to the founding documents the main objectives of the party were as follows:
# Autonomy for Alberta
# Freedom for Alberta
# Responsibility for Alberta&#x27;s government.

The Freedom Conservative Party advocates for an autonomous Alberta within a United Canada and is libertarian, and fiscally conservative in its leanings. For example, the parties founding documents call for the government to &quot;pass no law to protect two consenting adults from themselves&quot; and &quot;abolish unnecessary controls over the economy&quot;.

Fiscally the founding document lays out that Alberta should &quot;collect no more revenue than is needed and spend no more revenue than is required&quot;.

== History ==
The Freedom Conservative Party took over the legal shell of the former Alberta First Party. After changing its name to the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta on June 22, 2018, it gained its first MLA after Derek Fildebrandt changed his affiliation from Independent Conservative and crossed the floor after being barred from running as a candidate for the United Conservative Party.

He was appointed interim leader, pending a vote. During the announcement of the new party, Fildebrandt stated that it is not a separatist party but rather, its members were &quot;conservatives, libertarians and Alberta patriots&quot;.

It plans to run candidates in conservative strongholds, such as rural Alberta. Fildebrandt has stated he intends to avoid placing candidates in ridings where he believes the incumbent governing New Democratic Party would have a chance of winning in case of a split in the conservative vote.

== Leadership election == 
The party&#x27;s first convention under the Freedom Party name was held in Chestermere and first leadership race since 1999 was held on October 20, 2018. Interim leader Derek Fildebrandt was the only leadership candidate, and therefore was acclaimed as leader. After the 2019 Alberta General Election and resignation of Derek Fildebrandt, David White was elected on the second ballot as Interim Leader of the Freedom Conservative Party at a party meeting in Calgary on May 4, 2019. Three candidates were on the ballot. 
== Election results ==
The 30th Alberta general election which will be held in 2019 is the Freedom Conservative Parties first contested election in its current form.

In the Alberta 2019 election, the party is so far confirmed to be running the following candidates in the following ridings:

* Derek Fildebrandt (Leader) in Chestermere-Strathmore
* Matthew Morrisey in Airdrie-Cochrane
* Rick Northey in Airdrie-East
* Regina Shakirova in Calgary-Bow
* Kari Pomerleau in Calgary-Foothills
* Dejan Ristic in Calgary-Glenmore
* Sheyne Espey in Calgary-Peigan
* Cam Khan in Calgary-North West
* Rio Aiello in Calgary-West
* Wesley Caldwell in Camrose
* Steve Goodman in Drayton Valley-Devon
* Jason Norris in Edmonton-Whitemud
* Malcolm Stinson in Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville
* Bernard Hancock in Grande Prairie (provincial electoral district)
* Chad Miller in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake
* Jeff Rout in Leduc-Beaumont
* Keith Parrill in Lacombe-Ponoka
* David White in Maskwacis-Wetaskiwin
* Allen Maclennan in Olds-Didsbury-Three Hills
* Connie Russell in Peace River (provincial electoral district)
* Matt Chapin in Red Deer North
* Teah-Jay Cartwright in Red Deer South
* Dawn Berard in Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre
* Jim McKinnon in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright

<doc id="984121" wikidata="Q6546306" url="?curid=984121" title="Lighthorse (American Indian police)">
<text>Lighthorse (or Light Horse) is an official or colloquial name for the police forces of federally recognized tribes in the United States. Some tribal governments officially refer to their police as Lighthorse while others do not. Historically, the term referred to the Five Civilized Tribes of the United States&#x27; mounted police forces. The Lighthorse were generally organized into companies and assigned to different districts. Perhaps the most famous were the Cherokee Lighthorsemen which had their origins in Georgia. 

==Cherokee==
In 1797, the Cherokees created organizations called &quot;regulating companies&quot; to deal with horse theft and other property crimes. The regulating companies were a mounted tribal police force, empowered to enforce tribal laws. They began to be called &quot;Lighthorsemen&quot; in the 1820s. Their authority expanded to apprehending criminals, whom they turned over to tribal courts for trial and sentencing. The Lighthorsemen&#x27;s scope was then extended to more serious crimes including murder, rape and robbery. They also enforced the tribal laws against drunkenness. One author asserted that the Cherokees took the force&#x27;s name from General Henry &quot;Lighthorse Harry&quot; Lee, who got the nickname because his cavalry moved so quickly.

On November 13, 1844, the Cherokee National Council authorized the formation of a lighthorse company. Composed of a captain, a lieutenant and twenty four horsemen. They were to arrest all fugitives from justice in the Cherokee Nation. For several years the lighthorsemen also served as judges and jurors, administering punishments themselves. Usually, they punished those convicted of minor crimes by whipping. In 1874, the Cherokees built a prison at Tahlequah. It was the only Indian Nation to do so.

==Choctaw==
The Treaty of Doak&#x27;s Stand in 1820, appropriated US$600 per year to the Choctaw Nation to organize and maintain the Choctaw Lighthorsemen. These men were given the authority to arrest, try and punish those who broke tribal laws. The first corps became operational in 1824. Peter Pitchlynn became the head of this force in 1825. After the Choctaws were forcibly removed to Indian Territory, as part of the Indian Removal (1831-1833), the Lighthorsemen reported to the tribal Chief.

The Choctaw Constitution of 1838 specified that &quot;...It shall be the duty of any of the light horsemen to proclaim to the candidates or their representatives to form into separate lines; the voters forming in a line with such candidates as they wish to elect; and there shall be two or more judges appointed by the Captain of the Light-horse company to determine the number of electors in each line, and their qualifications; and one of said judges shall publicly state the number of voters in each line, and proclaim the person having the highest number elected; and it shall be the duty of the judges of the elections to report to the district clerks the names of the persons elected, and to what office, and by what majority; whose duty it shall be to record the same and inform the district Chief of the result of the election.&quot;

According to historian Carolyn Foreman, the treaty stipulated, &quot;...that all men, both white and red, may be compelled to pay their just debts, it is stipulated and agreed, that the sum of two hundred dollars shall be appropriated by the United States, for each district, annually, and placed in the hands of the agent, to pay the expenses incurred in raising and establishing said corps; which is to act as executive officers, in maintaining good order, and compelling bad men to remove from the nation, who are not authorized to live In it by a regular permit from the agent.&quot;

Light horsemen rode their own horses and used their own weapons.

==Creek==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Confederate States of America (CSA) made a treaty with the Creek Nation. Among many other provisions, the CSA promised to provide CS$600 per year for the support of lighthorsemen.

During 1882–1883, a group of dissident Creeks led by Isparhecher revolted against the leadership of Principal Chief Samuel Checote. Checote responded by ordering the Creek Lighthorsemen to put down the rebellion. He soon put Pleasant Porter as the leader of the lighthorsemen. Porter and his men were successful in forcing the dissidents to leave Creek territory and take refuge in Sac and Fox territory and later in Kiowa territory. The dissidents found they were unwelcome in both places. They returned to make peace with the majority of the tribe. Porter later became principal chief of the Creek Nation (1899–1907).

==Seminole==
The Seminoles were the last of the Five Civilized Tribes to establish their own police force. They had no funds for that, and during the American Civil War, the Seminole Government was dysfunctional. In 1876 Governor John Brown hired A. Q. Teague, a young cattle drover from Texas, as the first lighthorseman.

<doc id="984127" wikidata="Q1366514" url="?curid=984127" title="Bathynomus giganteus">
<text>Bathynomus giganteus is a species of aquatic crustacean, of the order Isopoda. It is a member of the [[giant isopod]]s(&quot;Bathynomus&quot;), and as such it is related—albeit distantly—to shrimps and crabs. It was the first &quot;Bathynomus&quot; species ever documented and was described in 1879 by French zoologist Alphonse Milne Edwards after the isopod was found in fishermen&#x27;s nets off the coast of the Dry Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico.

The &quot;Bathynomus&quot; genus is benthic and abundant in cold waters with a depth of 310–2140 m in the West-Atlantic, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. It was the first species of &quot;Bathynomus&quot; to be described and historically it was reported from other oceans, but these are now recognized as other closely related species. The unusually large size of &quot;Bathynomus&quot; has been attributed to an effect called deep-sea gigantism, where invertebrates living in cold deep waters tend to grow larger and have longer lifespans.

==Physical description==

Like most crustaceans, the body of &quot;Bathynomus giganteus&quot; is divided into three distinct regions; a head (cephalon), a thorax, and an abdomen (pleon). They have large triangular compound eyes that are spaced very far apart and have over 4000 individual facets. When light bounces off a highly-reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum at the back of their eyes, it makes them appear to glow. &quot;B. giganteus&quot; reaches a typical length between 19 and 36 cm an individual claimed to be 76 cm long has been reported by the popular press, but the largest confirmed was ca. 50 cm.

==Reproduction== 
&quot;Bathynomus&quot; reproduce via egg-laying. Mature females develop a pouch known as a marsupium, where the eggs are stored until the young are ready to emerge as miniatures of the adults, known as manca, completely bypassing a larval stage. Mancae can reach lengths up to 60 mm and are characterized by their lack of the seventh pair of pereiopods. The reproductive anatomy of &quot;Bathynomus giganteus&quot; resembles that of other isopods. The females of &quot;B. giganteus&quot;, while being so many times larger than females of other isopods, carries approximately the same number of eggs in its marsupium. The eggs, however, show an increase in size which appears to be almost proportional to the increase in body size. The reproductive organs of the males also resemble those of the males of smaller isopod species.

==Ecology==
As scavengers, &quot;Bathynomus giganteus&quot; plays a crucial role in the deep-sea ecosystem. They feed on the remains of dead marine organisms that sink to the ocean floor, helping to recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. This scavenging behavior is vital for maintaining the balance of deep-sea communities.

== Aquaculture ==
Giant isopods are not usually fished commercially. However, other &quot;Bathynomus&quot; species can be found in the occasional oceanside restaurant in northern Taiwan, where they are boiled and typically served with rice.

<doc id="984128" wikidata="Q225471" url="?curid=984128" title="Burlington House">
<text>Burlington House is a building on Piccadilly in Mayfair, London. It was originally a private English Baroque and then Neo-Palladian mansion owned by the Earls of Burlington. It was significantly expanded in the mid-19th century after being purchased by the British government. Today, the Royal Academy and five learned societies occupy much of the building.

==History==
The house was one of the earliest of a number of very large private residences built on the north side of Piccadilly, previously a country lane, from the 1660s onwards. The first version was begun by Sir John Denham in about 1664. It was a red-brick double-pile hip-roofed mansion with a recessed centre, typical of the style of the time, or perhaps even a little old fashioned. Denham may have acted as his own architect, or he may have employed Hugh May, who certainly became involved in the construction after the house was sold in an incomplete state in 1667 to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, from whom it derives its name. Burlington had the house completed, which was the largest structure on his land, the Burlington Estate.

In 1704, the house was passed on to ten-year-old Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who was to become the principal patron of the Neo-Palladian movement in England, and an architect in his own right. Around 1709, during Burlington&#x27;s minority, Lady Juliana Boyle, the second Countess, commissioned James Gibbs to reconfigure the staircase and make exterior alterations to the house, including a quadrant Doric colonnade which was later praised by Sir William Chambers as &quot;one of the finest pieces of architecture&quot;. The colonnade separated the house from increasingly urbanized Piccadilly with a &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;. Inside, Baroque decorative paintings in the entrance hall and a staircase by Sebastiano Ricci and Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini makes it one of the richest interiors in London.
In between his two Grand Tours of Italy (1714 and 1719), the 3rd Earl of Burlington&#x27;s taste was transformed by the publication of Giacomo Leoni&#x27;s &quot;Palladio&quot;, which made him develop a passion for Palladian architecture. In 1717 or 1718, the young Lord Burlington began making major modifications to Burlington House, and the supervision of the work was undertaken by Gibbs.

Later, Colen Campbell was appointed to replace Gibbs, who was working in the Baroque style of Sir Christopher Wren, to recast the work in a new manner on the old foundation. This was a key moment in the history of English architecture, as Campbell&#x27;s work was in a strict Palladian style. The aesthetic preferences of Campbell and Burlington, soon joined by the aesthetic style of their close associate William Kent (who worked on interiors at Burlington House), were to provide the leading strain in English architecture and interior decoration for two generations.

Campbell&#x27;s work closely followed the form of the previous building and reused much of the structure, but the conventional front (south) façade was replaced with an austere two-storey composition, taking Palladio&#x27;s Palazzo Iseppo di Porti in Vicenza for a model but omitting sculpture and substituting a balustrade for the attic storey. The ground floor became a rusticated basement, which supported a monumental &quot;piano nobile&quot; of nine bays. This had no centrepiece but was highlighted by venetian windows in the projecting end bays, the first to be seen in England. Other alterations included a monumental screening gateway to Piccadilly and the reconstruction of most of the principal interiors, with typical Palladian features such as rich coved ceilings.

The Saloon, constructed immediately after William Kent&#x27;s return from Rome in December 1719, has survived in the most intact condition; it was the first Kentian interior designed in England. Its plaster putti above the pedimented doorcases were probably by Giovanni Battista Guelfi.
Lord Burlington transferred his architectural energies to Chiswick House after 1722. Upon Burlington&#x27;s death in 1753, Burlington House was passed on to the Dukes of Devonshire, but they had no need of it as they already owned Devonshire House just along Piccadilly. The fourth Duke&#x27;s younger son Lord George Cavendish and a Devonshire in-law, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, each used the house for at least two separate periods. Portland had some of the interiors altered by John Carr in the 1770s.

Eventually Lord George, who was a rich man in his own right due to having married an heiress, purchased the house from his nephew, William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, for £70,000 in 1815. Lord George employed Samuel Ware to shift the staircase to the centre and reshape the interiors to provide a suite of &quot;Fine Rooms&quot; &quot;en enfilade&quot;, linking the new state dining room at the west end to the new ballroom at the east end. Like Carr&#x27;s work, Ware&#x27;s was sympathetic with the Palladian style of the house, providing an early example of the &quot;Kent Revival&quot;, a particularly English prefiguration of Baroque Revival architecture. In 1819, the Burlington Arcade was built along the western part of the grounds.

In 1854, Burlington House was sold to the British government for £140,000, originally with the plan of demolishing the building and using the site to build the University of London. This plan, however, was abandoned in the face of strong opposition. In 1857, Burlington House was occupied by the scientifically focused, Royal Society, the Linnean Society, and the Chemical Society (later the Royal Society of Chemistry).
The Royal Academy of Arts took over the main block in 1867 on a 999-year lease, with rent of £1 per year. It was required to pay for its top-lit main art galleries, designed by Sidney Smirke on a part of the gardens to the north of the main range and its art school premises; Smirke also raised the central block with a third storey. The former east and west service wings on either side of the courtyard and the wall and gate to Piccadilly were replaced by much more voluminous wings by the partnership of Robert Richardson Banks and Charles Barry Jr., in an approximation of Campbell&#x27;s style. These were completed in 1873, and the three societies moved into these. In 1874, they were joined by the Geological Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society and the Society of Antiquaries.
This arrangement lasted until 1968, when the Royal Society moved to new premises in Carlton House Terrace, and its apartments were split between the Royal Society of Chemistry and the British Academy. The British Academy also moved to Carlton House Terrace in 1998, and the Royal Society of Chemistry took over the rest of the east wing.

In 2004, the Courtyard Societies went to court against the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister over the terms of their tenure of the apartments in Burlington House, which they have enjoyed rent-free. The dispute was sent to mediation, after which the following statement was released: &quot;The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Learned Societies had a very constructive meeting on 16 March which envisages the continued presence of the Learned Societies at Burlington House. Discussions are continuing with a view to formalising the arrangement on a basis which is acceptable to all parties.&quot;

In August 2019, the MHCLG (the successor body to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) gave formal notice to the Courtyard Societies that by 2022 they would have to pay commercial rents for the premises at Burlington House. The imposition of higher rents on the Courtyard Societies who are reliant on charitable funds and membership income was set to bankrupt them unless they leave, effectively ending 150 years of joint intellectual effort and public scientific meetings at Burlington House. After several years of negotiations, the Courtyard Societies and MHCLG agreed a 999-year lease for the building in March 2024, with the Geological Society paying £5.5 million in instalments over 10 years for their share.

==Present occupants==
Burlington House is most familiar to the general public as the venue for art exhibitions from the Royal Academy. The academy is housed in the main building at the northern end of the courtyard. Five learned societies occupy the two wings on the east and west sides of the courtyard and the Piccadilly wing at the southern end. Collectively known as the Courtyard Societies, these societies are:

*Geological Society of London (Piccadilly/east wing)
*Linnean Society of London (Piccadilly/west wing)
*Royal Astronomical Society (west wing)
*Society of Antiquaries of London (west wing)
*Royal Society of Chemistry (east wing)

Burlington House has been listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England since February 1970.

==Public access==
The courtyard of Burlington House, known as the &quot;Annenberg Courtyard&quot;, is open to the public during the day. It features a statue of Joshua Reynolds and fountains arranged in the pattern of the planets at the time of his birth.

The wooden prototype K2 telephone box, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, has been located in the entrance to the courtyard since 1924; In 2019, it was listed to Grade II* in &quot;recognition of its iconic design status&quot;.

The Royal Academy&#x27;s public art exhibitions are staged in nineteenth-century additions to the main block which are of little architectural interest. However, in 2004 the principal reception rooms on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; were opened to the public after restoration as the &quot;John Madejski Fine Rooms&quot;. They contain many of the principal works in the academy&#x27;s permanent collection, which predominantly features works by Royal Academicians and small temporary exhibitions drawn from the collection. The east, west and Piccadilly wings are occupied by the learned societies and are generally not open to the public unless for attending public lectures or academic exhibitions by appointment.

<text>Book music () is a medium for storing the music played on mechanical organs, mainly of European manufacture. Book music is made from thick cardboard, containing perforated holes specifying the musical notes to be played, with the book folded zig-zag style. Unlike the heavy pinned barrels, which could only contain a few tunes of fixed length, that had been used on earlier instruments, book music enabled large repertoires to be built up. The length of each tune was no longer determined by the physical dimensions of the instrument. 

In 1892, organ maker Anselmo Gavioli patented the &quot;book organ,&quot; with a series of folded sheets of cardboard. Holes punched on the pages of the folded book allowed keys to rise in the key frame playing the required note. The keys would cause considerable wear to the music books over time. A solution to this was the keyless frame where the holes allowed air to pass through. The development marked a turning point in the history of the mechanical organ, and it made Gavioli, until his demise in 1910, the most famous and prolific of fair-organ builders.

Book music was the most commonly used medium for large instruments. Used extensively by fairground and street organ makers, book music was also used by Henri Fourneaux in 1863 in his Pianista.

One of the advantages of book music is that it can be mechanically interpreted. Keys, small levers which rock upwards when a hole passes by, run underneath the book. This motion then mechanically opens the valves of the organ.

Paper rolls on the other hand are &quot;key-less&quot; and are generally only read by pneumatic pressure or suction. Some mechanical organs, particularly those of German manufacture by firms such as Gbr Bruder and Ruth, play keyless cardboard book music, operating pneumatically.

The disadvantage of book music, compared to paper rolls, is the increased size and weight to store an equivalent amount of music. The major advantage of book music, however, is that it is sturdy and not subject to expansion and contraction with humidity. In addition, it is not necessary to rewind a book after playing; therefore, a musical performance may continue almost immediately without a prolonged break (while the instrument is occupied with rewinding the roll). This allows for large books and sets of books to be manufactured, allowing musically versatile capabilities. In Europe the book format, rather than the roll, is the preferred method of operating all but the smallest instruments designed for outdoor use.

<text>The Bua languages are a subgroup of the Mbum–Day subgroup of the Savanna languages spoken by fewer than 30,000 people in southern Chad in an area stretching roughly between the Chari River and the Guéra Massif. They were labeled &quot;G13&quot; in Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s Adamawa language-family proposal. They are ultimately part of the Niger–Congo family, and have exerted a significant influence on Laal.

Bua languages have had extensive contact with Chadic languages.

==Languages==
The Bua languages include:
* Bua language (7,708 speakers in 1993), north of the Chari River around Korbol and Gabil (after which the group was named); mutually comprehensible with Fanian.
* Fanian, or Mana, or Kobe (&gt; 1,100 speakers in 1997), in the villages of Mouraye, Sengué, Malakonjo, Rim, Sisi, Karo west of Lake Iro.
* Niellim or Lua (5,157 speakers in 1993), spoken around Niellim and Niou along the Chari River north of Sarh (including the extinct Chini dialect)
* Tunia (2,255 speakers in 1993), around Sarh (including the extinct Perim dialect)
* Noy or Loo (36 speakers in 1993), spoken in Bedaya, Balimba, Djoli, Koumra, and Koumogo south of Sarh. Nearly extinct.
* Gula languages:
** Gula Iro or Kulaal (3,500 speakers in 1991), around Lake Iro.
** Zan Gula (4,000 speakers in 1997), around Zan and Chinguil.
** Bon Gula (&gt; 1,200 speakers in 1997), in the villages of Bon and Ibir.
* Koke (600 speakers in 1993), around Daguela
* Bolgo (1,800 speakers in 1993), near Melfi, in Koya, Boli, Gagne, and Bedi.

The first to note the similarity between Bua and Niellim in print was Gustav Nachtigal, in 1889. Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes added Tunia and &quot;Mana&quot; (possibly an alternate name for Fanian) in 1907, forming a &quot;Groupe Boa&quot;. Johannes Lukas (1937) likewise described a &quot;Bua-Gruppe&quot; consisting of Bua, Niellim, and Koke, and in Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s 1963 classification &quot;The Languages of Africa&quot;, the three languages were placed together in the Adamawa subphylum as a group named Adamawa-13. Later, Pairault (1965, 1969) added the more northerly Gula languages, Fanian, Koke, and Bolgo, allowing Samarin (1971) to define roughly the current membership of the Bua languages/Adamawa-13. Palayer later added Noy.

A full list of Bua languages from Boyeldieu, et al. (2018:55-56) is given below.

==Classification==
Kastenholz&#x27;s (2017:2) preliminary classification divides the Bua languages into a Riverine group and an Inland group.
*Bua
**Riverine
***Tun
***Ɓa, Lua
**Inland
***Koke, Bolgo
***Gula
****Bon Gula
****nuclear Gula
*****Zan Gula
*****Fãya, Kulaal

==Linguistic features==
All of these languages are tonal, with distinctive vowel length and nasal vowels in limited contexts. Most of these languages have lost the typical Niger–Congo noun class system (Goula Iro appears to have retained it to some degree.) However, its former presence is betrayed by their quite complicated system of plural formation, combining internal ablaut with changes to final consonants and/or suffixation.

<text>Xenosaurus grandis, commonly known as the knob-scaled lizard, is a species of diurnal, terrestrial lizard endemic to Mexico and Guatemala. It primarily inhabits tropical rainforests. It dwells in rock crevices and eats insects.

==Etymology==
The scientific name, &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot;, comes from the Greek words &quot;xenos&quot;, meaning “alien”, “stranger”, or “foreigner”, &quot;saurus&quot;, meaning “lizard”, and &quot;grandis&quot;, meaning “grand” or “great”.
Its common name, “knob-scaled lizard”, refers to the bumpy, “knob-like” scales found on the upper portion of its body.

==Taxonomy==
There are five recognized subspecies, which are spread throughout the species’ range, and the species complex is being reevaluated. Some of the subspecies are currently in the process of being elevated to species status. 
The species as a whole is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List and its population is currently decreasing.

==Physiology==

===Appearance===
&quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; has a flattened head and body and is nearly always found in rock crevices, or at least with a portion of the body in a crevice.
Its flattened physiology is most likely an adaptation to allow it to squeeze into narrow crevices. Its color ranges from dark grey to dark brown, with lighter bands or blotches. It has a forked tongue, and small, sharp, fang-like teeth.

===Body size===

On average, the snout-vent length (SVL) of &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; is 6.8 - 12.9 cm. 

While some species of &quot;Xenosaurus&quot; do not exhibit sexual dimorphism, &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot;, among other species, is one that does.
In &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot;, males and females do not differ significantly in body size, but males have proportionately larger heads (in length and width) than females. Males and females of &quot;X. grandis&quot; do not exhibit a significant difference in femur length or head shape.

===Body temperature===
&quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; is a diurnally active thermal conformer, meaning that its body temperature correlates with substrate and air temperatures. Its average body temperature is 22.7 C. Air and substrate temperatures may be particularly relevant in &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; since they are almost exclusively ground and crevice dwellers.
Temperatures seem to differ across &quot;Xenosaurus&quot; species, possibly because of environment and habitat. &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; appears to inhabit more dense tropical forests, where sunlight may not reach the ground as much.
While body temperature is influenced by the lizard&#x27;s amount of cover and its body position in its crevice, it does not seem to be influenced by sex, month, vegetation type, or any crevice characteristics.

===Diet===
Lizards in the genus &quot;Xenosaurus&quot; are exclusively found in crevices. Such a lifestyle suggests that the diets of these lizards might be opportunistic, and they eat whatever crawls or flies past or into their crevice. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but occasional lizard prey are taken. Their most frequent prey includes coleopterans (beetles), dipterans (flies), orthopterans (insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, weta, and locusts), and myriapods (terrestrial arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes). On the basis of number, they consume the most dipterans, but on the basis of volume, they consume the most orthopterans.

==Behavior==
The Knob-scaled lizard is diurnal, meaning it is active during the day. Due to its diet of Orthoptera and Lepitdoptera larvae, Xenosaurus grandis is an ambush predator. It waits in its rocky crevice home and strikes with the element of surprise. It is a very solitary and aggressive species and will often fight with members of its own species over territory.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; and the rest of the xenosaurids are viviparous, which means offspring are birthed live rather than in eggs. Young are birthed after a 9-month gestation period. The majority of litters contain only three offspring, but litters ranging from two to seven offspring have also been observed. Male knob-scaled lizards reach maturity at 28 months, while females reach maturity a little later, at 32 months. It is also plausible to say that &quot;X. grandis&quot; do not produce young every year.

==Geographic range==
There are five major population areas for the &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; in Southern Mexico and Guatemala: central Veracruz, southern Oaxaca, north-central Oaxaca, the highlands of central Chiapas, and central Guatemala. The separate population areas have given rise to five subspecies of &quot;X. grandis&quot;. The five subspecies are &quot;X. g. grandis, X. g. agrenon, X. g. arboreus, X. g. rackhami, and X. g. sanmartinesis&quot;.

==Habitat==
All the subspecies of &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; live exclusively in rock crevices, which allows them to live in many habitats, including: xerophytic vegetation, tropical rainforests, cloud forests, oak forests, and tropical deciduous rainforests. The lizards have strong attachments to where they live, only living in 1-2 rock crevices for 95% of their entire lives.

==Conservation status==
Currently &quot;Xenosaurus grandis&quot; is categorized as a vulnerable species according to the IUCN. The species was given this status because of fragmented populations, decreasing population size, and decreasing habitat quality and area, covering only 20,000 square km. The greatest threats to the survival of the species in the wild are habitat destruction and trapping for international pet trade. Eagles are the greatest natural predator of &quot;X. grandis&quot;, but they are not considered a threat to the survival of the species as a whole. Also, warmer temperatures in their habitat have been shown to cause greater mortality rates among the lizards, posing another potential threat to the species.

===Temperature===
Higher temperatures have been associated with higher mortality rates for &quot;X. grandis&quot;. In the 2003-2004 wet season of Southern Mexico and Guatemala (the habitat regions of the species), the average temperature was 24.3 C. That temperature was in the top 12% of highest recorded temperatures in the past 34 years of record keeping. The mortality rate for yearlings (the youngest age group) increased from 0.1923 to 0.6551 and for adult II (the oldest age group) increased from 0.3956 to 0.5676 for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 wet seasons respectively. If temperatures continue to increase, the survival of the species will be further threatened and currently 50% of wet seasons are warm enough to be considered to be unfavorable for the species.

===Population and growth rates===
As of 2004, &quot;X. grandis&quot; had a survival rate of 70.5% and a growth rate of 0.851. Even though the rates may appear to be low, in comparison to other lizard genera and families &quot;X. grandis&quot; is doing well. Currently the species is decreasing in population, which is thought to be primarily caused by human development destroying their habitat. If habitat destruction stops, the population should at least be stable, if not prosperous.

<text>Walter Clyde &quot;Puggy&quot; Pearson (January 29, 1929 – April 12, 2006) was an American professional poker player. He is best known as the 1973 World Series of Poker Main Event winner.

==Early years==
Pearson was born in Kentucky and raised in Tennessee in a family with nine siblings. He got his nickname &quot;Puggy&quot; from a childhood accident that left him with a disfigured nose at the age of twelve. He dropped out of school in the fifth grade, and at the age of 17, he joined the United States Navy, where he served three tours. He strengthened his skills at poker and gambling while in the Navy.

==Professional poker career==

Prior to 1949, all poker games were cash games; a player could cash out his chips and leave at any time. Pearson originated the idea of a freezeout tournament and shared his idea with fellow gambler &quot;Nick the Greek&quot; Dandolos in the early 1950s. Dandolos later brought the idea to legendary casino owner Benny Binion. After further urging by Pearson, Amarillo Slim, and Doyle Brunson, all of whom felt that such a tournament would create great side (cash) game action, Binion founded the World Series of Poker in 1970. Pearson participated in the first World Series of Poker that year along with Amarillo Slim, Doyle Brunson, Sailor Roberts, Crandell Addington, and Carl Cannon.

Pearson won his first World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in the 1971 Limit Seven-Card Stud preliminary event. 

Pearson was involved in a controversial ending to the 1972 WSOP Main Event. He ended up being the runner-up to Amarillo Slim, but there was a question of fair play.

In 1973, Pearson won two preliminary events in the WSOP. In the same World Series, he won the Main Event when his A♠ 7♠ defeated Johnny Moss&#x27;s J♠. With the Main Event victory, Pearson became the first player in WSOP history to win three events in a single year. This record has since been matched by five others. He won four bracelets, two of which were in seven-card stud and two of which were No limit hold&#x27;em.

Pearson was known as a man who would always seek out the biggest game in town, whether it was in the poker room or on the golf course. He owned a RV, which he called the Roving Gambler, with this painted on the side: &quot;I&#x27;ll play any man from any land any game he can name for any amount I can count, provided I like it.&quot;

Pearson was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1987.

==World Series of Poker Bracelets==
==Death==
Pearson, who had a long history of heart problems, died on April 12, 2006.

<text>Jerome Chodorov (August 10, 1911 – September 12, 2004) was an American playwright, librettist, and screenwriter. He co-wrote the book with Joseph A. Fields for the original Broadway musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; starring Rosalind Russell. The musical was based on short stories by Ruth McKenney.

==Biography==
Chodorov was born in New York City, and entered journalism in the 1930s. He is best known for his 1940 play &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, its 1942 screen adaptation, and the musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, which was based on his play. Joseph A. Fields was his frequent collaborator. The writing team also adapted Sally Benson&#x27;s short stories as the play &quot;Junior Miss&quot;, which was later adapted as a play and a TV musical. Chodorov was Hollywood blacklisted during the McCarthy era.

His brother, Edward Chodorov (1904–1988), was also a playwright, author of the perennial favorite of amateur groups, &quot;Kind Lady&quot;.

<text>Franklin G. Wells (March 4, 1932 – April 3, 1994) was an American businessman who served as President and Chief Operating Officer of The Walt Disney Company from 1984 until his death in 1994.

==Life and career==
Wells was born in Coronado, California and traced his ancestry back to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. He attended Pomona College, which he left as Phi Beta Kappa in 1953. Wells was a recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship, through which he obtained a BA at Oxford University. He went into the army for two years as an infantry first lieutenant and then graduated from Stanford Law School and became a lawyer.

Before his tenure with Disney, Wells had worked for Warner Bros. as its West Coast vice president in 1969, then in 1973 as president, and in 1977 as vice chairman until he left the company in 1982.

Disney directors Roy E. Disney, Stanley Gold and Sid Bass had ousted President and CEO Ron W. Miller in 1984. The Disney board then recruited Wells to become Disney&#x27;s president and chief operating officer (1984–1994), along with Michael Eisner as chairman and CEO, and Jeffrey Katzenberg as head of Walt Disney Studios. Wells was unique among the management troika in that he had the highest academic achievement. Although the number-two executive at Disney, Wells reported to the board of directors and not to Eisner.

==Seven Summits==
Wells was an avid alpinist and came close to achieving his goal of climbing the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each of the seven continents:
* Kilimanjaro in Africa
* Denali (Mount McKinley) in North America
* Aconcagua in South America
* Elbrus in Europe
* Mount Everest in Asia
* Mount Kosciuszko in Australia
* Vinson in Antarctica
Only Everest eluded him, as bad weather had forced his party to descend when just 3,000 feet from the summit. His partner in the Seven Summits attempt, Dick Bass, an entrepreneur who developed the Snowbird ski resort in Utah, later made it up all seven peaks, the first man to do so. At the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction at Disneyland, Wells&#x27; love of mountain climbing is honored with exploration equipment emblazoned with the words &quot;Wells Expedition,&quot; which can be seen during the ride&#x27;s downhill descent, as well as on a window on Main Street USA honoring him.

==Death==
Wells died in a helicopter crash on April 3, 1994 while returning from a heliskiing trip in Nevada&#x27;s Ruby Mountains. Pilot Dave Walton and rock climber Beverly Johnson were also killed in the crash. He was a good friend of Clint Eastwood, who had been skiing with Wells that weekend. Eastwood left in his own helicopter just an hour before Wells&#x27; departure. Because of poor weather in the area, the chartered Bell 206 helicopter carrying Wells had landed at a remote location about two and a half hours prior to the crash. While waiting for improved weather conditions, snow fell on the helicopter. During the subsequent takeoff and ascent, the engine lost power and the aircraft crashed on a 30-degree slope, followed by a rollover, during an attempted emergency landing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was &quot;the ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power).&quot; Of the five persons on board, four were killed. The sole survivor was Mike Hoover.

Wells was buried at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery. At the funeral, Eastwood sang a tribute of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, which Wells liked to sing on the slopes. &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which came out the summer after Wells&#x27; death, includes a dedication right before the Walt Disney Pictures logo appears (though the 2003 Platinum Edition, the 2011 Diamond Edition and the 2017 Signature Edition have the dedication at the end of the credits). The building housing the Walt Disney Archives at Walt Disney Studios was also named in Wells&#x27; honor.

<text>The blue duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos) or whio is a member of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae endemic to New Zealand. It is the only member of the genus Hymenolaimus. Its exact taxonomic status is still unresolved, but it appears to be most closely related to the tribe Anatini, the dabbling ducks.

The whio is depicted on the reverse side of the New Zealand $10 banknote.

== Taxonomy ==
Captain James Cook saw the blue duck in Dusky Sound, South Island, New Zealand, on his second voyage to the south Pacific. In 1777 both Cook and the naturalist Georg Forster mentioned the blue duck in their separate accounts of the voyage. A specimen was described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham used the English name, the &quot;soft-billed duck&quot;. When in 1789 the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; he included the blue duck and placed it with all the other ducks in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Anas malacorhynchos&quot; and cited the earlier works. The blue duck is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Hymenolaimus&quot; that was introduced specifically for the species by George Robert Gray in 1843. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;humēn&quot;, &quot;humenos&quot; meaning &quot;skin&quot; or &quot;membrane&quot; with &quot;laimos&quot; meaning &quot;throat&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;malacorhynchos&quot; is also from Ancient Greek and combines &quot;malakos&quot; meaning &quot;soft&quot; with &quot;rhunkhos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;.

The species has no close relatives. Its taxonomic relationships with other waterfowl species remains uncertain; DNA analysis has placed it as a sister to the South American dabbling ducks (Anatini), but with no close relative. As of 2013, it was commonly listed as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; but likely within the Anatinae and allied to the Anatini. It was formerly thought to be related to the shelduck tribe.

It is commonly known in New Zealand English by its Māori name Whio, pronounced , which is an onomatopoeic rendition of the males&#x27; call. Other names it may be known by are Mountain Duck or Blue Mountain Duck.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;H. m. hymenolaimus&quot; Mathews, 1937 – central, south North Island (New Zealand)
* &quot;H. m. malacorhynchos&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – west South Island (New Zealand)

Prior to 2022, the North Island and South Island whio were considered distinct but were not distinguished as subspecies; they were, however, treated as separate management units. However, the populations were defined as distinct subspecies by the International Ornithological Congress in 2022, based on strong genetic divergence and some plumage differences.

==Description==
The blue duck is long and varies in weight by sex. Females are smaller than males, weighing , whereas the males weigh . The plumage is a dark slate-grey with a greenish sheen on the head, a chestnut-flecked breast. The outer are tipped with white and the inner ones have black margins. The plumage of the two sexes are mostly the same, although the female has slightly less chestnut in the chest. The pinkish-white bill has fleshy flaps of skin hanging from the sides of its tip. The beak is green at hatching and develops its final colour eight hours later .

=== Song ===
The male&#x27;s call is a high-pitched whistle. The female&#x27;s call is a rattling growl or low-pitched grating notes.

==Behaviour==
This species is an endemic resident breeder in New Zealand, nesting in hollow logs, small caves and other sheltered spots. It is a rare duck, holding territories on fast flowing mountain rivers. It is a powerful swimmer even in strong currents, but is reluctant to fly. It is difficult to find, but not particularly wary when located.

===Diet===
The blue duck feeds almost entirely on aquatic invertebrate larvae. A study of blue ducks on the Manganuiateao River in the central North Island found the most common prey items were Chironomidae (midge) and cased caddisfly larvae, although cased caddisfly were less preferred and were only consumed so much because of their abundance. Hydrobiosidae (free-living caddisfly) and &quot;Aphrophila neozelandica&quot; (crane fly) larvae were also frequently eaten. Other prey included mayfly, &quot;Aoteapysche&quot; (net-building caddis) and stonefly larvae. The blue duck on occasion take berries and the fruits of shrubs.

===Foraging===
The foraging behaviour of the blue duck is characterized by its reliance on benthic invertebrates in fast-flowing riverine environments. Blue ducks primarily engage in dabbling behaviour where they feed by scouring rocks rather than up-ending or dabbling at the water&#x27;s surface. Observations indicate that territorial males and females dabble approximately 96% of the time, with juvenile ducks dabbling 86% of the time. During the diurnal cycle, territorial birds exhibit higher foraging in the early morning and late evening, while non-territorial birds tend to forage more at midday. The decrease in dabbling during midday corresponds with an increase in diving behaviour in deeper pools. This pattern suggests that blue ducks capitalize on invertebrate resources that vary in availability throughout the day. Diving behaviour was seen most frequent in March and July when water levels are higher and prey living on stones and boulders above the water-surface would have been inaccessible using alternative foraging methods. Blue ducks’ foraging activities peak during early morning and late afternoon, coinciding with the diurnal activity patterns of invertebrate drift. The reliance on these temporal patterns allows blue ducks to exploit a resource that is continuously recolonizing denuded areas in the river. Ducks can be seen feeding at other times but often the day and night is spent in hiding or resting. Feeding behaviour is influenced by the type of prey available, requiring both tactile and visual foraging techniques. While foraging, blue ducks primarily glean invertebrates from rock surfaces using visual cues for mobile prey such as mayfly larvae. They have forward facing eyes that indicate this visual foraging use, typical of diving ducks, some attribute the evolution of this feature to the special absence of predators. Blue ducks also utilize tactile cues to scrape small chironomid larvae from submerged surfaces. Changes in water clarity can therefore significantly affect foraging efficiency, particularly for mobile prey. Territoriality in blue ducks is closely linked to the availability of food resources. Although blue ducks occupy large territories, the size is not primarily determined by food abundance; rather, it reflects the overlapping life cycles of benthic invertebrates, which exhibit minimal seasonal variation. This indicates that while food resources are critical for blue duck distribution and population structure, they do not necessarily dictate territorial size.

===Territoriality===
Blue ducks display territorial behaviours, they are known for their year-round territoriality, with territories typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 kilometres along river habitats characterized by alternating pools and rapids. The size and boundaries of these territories depend on resource availability, environmental conditions, and competition with other blue ducks. During the breeding season, territory defence becomes critical as breeding pairs protect their territories from intruders. This behaviour secures access to essential resources and optimal breeding sites, enhancing reproductive success.
Both male and female blue ducks cooperate to defend their territories, using a variety of behaviours to deter intruders. Defensive behaviours include head bobbing, vocalizations, and aggressive confrontations. These behaviours communicate their presence and resolve conflicts over territory. The intensity of these interactions varies based on several factors, including the presence of a female during confrontations. When females are present, aggressive behaviours may escalate, highlighting the significance of mate guarding in territory defence. This interaction shows social and environmental factors shaping territorial behaviour. Territoriality in blue ducks is linked to habitat quality. Research indicates that pairs in higher-quality environments expend less energy on territorial defence, allowing for greater foraging opportunities and improved reproductive fitness. While pairs defend their territories, extensive areas between them may remain unprotected. Juvenile and unpaired blue ducks exploit these undefended spaces for foraging, indicating that territoriality does not completely limit resource availability for non-breeding individuals. After the breeding period, blue ducks may adjust their territorial size in response to resource availability, often reducing their territory to focus on the most productive areas. As the breeding season progresses, interactions between neighbouring pairs can intensify, particularly with increasing competition for shared resources. Most aggressive confrontations involve males defending territories against foraging intruders, highlighting male-male competition&#x27;s role in shaping blue duck social dynamics.

===Mating===
Blue ducks exhibit a complex social structure characterized by strong pair bonds and monogamous behaviour, integral to their reproductive success and territory defence in riverine habitats. Typically, blue ducks maintain permanent year-round territories defended by mated pairs, emphasizing the significance of monogamy for the successful rearing of offspring. Pair members rarely stray far from each other, with individuals often remaining in close proximity throughout the year. In blue ducks, synchronous behaviours further enhance the stability of pair bonds, as pairs coordinate their activities, particularly during periods of brood dispersal and moulting. Pairs often forage together, displaying high synchronization rates during various behavioural activities, which can range from 62% during moult to 81% in the pre-laying phase. This synchronized behaviour is said to likely improve foraging efficiency and reduces vulnerability to predation, reinforcing the significance of the social bonds. During incubation, males shift their foraging habits to support female partners and their offspring, highlighting a collaborative approach to parental care. Although blue ducks generally exhibit monogamous pair bonding, instances of extra-pair mating may occur, particularly when environmental pressures or territory dynamics shift. 

===Breeding===

Blue ducks nest between August and October, laying 4–9 creamy white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 31 to 32 days and chicks can fly when about 70 days old.

Nesting and egg incubation of four to seven eggs is undertaken by the female while the male stands guard. Nests are shallow, twig, grass and down-lined scrapes in caves, under river-side vegetation or in log-jams, and are therefore very prone to spring floods. For this, and other reasons, their breeding success is extremely variable from one year to the next.

==Captivity==

Captive North Island whio are held and bred on both main islands of New Zealand, but the progeny are returned to their respective island. South Island whio are held and bred in captivity on the South Island only. All captives are kept by approved and permitted zoological and wildlife facilities as part of the national recovery plan. As part of this current ten-year plan (2009–2019) is the WHIONE programme which works with specially trained nose dogs to locate nests. The eggs are removed, and the ducklings hatched and raised in captivity. Later they are conditioned for coordinated release.

Blue ducks were presented to the International Waterfowl Association in the UK in the 1970s along with New Zealand shovelers, New Zealand scaup, and brown teal by The Wildlife Service of New Zealand. The species was maintained in the UK until at least 2012 before dying out; efforts to create the only captive breeding population outside of New Zealand with these ducks ultimately failed when the last two male ducks formed a same-sex relationship with each other instead of with the female that was assigned to them. They have not been known to be exported and maintained anywhere else internationally.

==Status==
The blue duck is classified as Endangered by the IUCN due to its highly fragmented and shrinking population, and it is listed as Nationally Endangered in the New Zealand Threat Classification System. A 2010 census estimated a total population size of 2,500–3,000 individuals, with a maximum of 1,200 pairs.

The blue duck is a very localised species now threatened by predation from introduced mammals such as stoats, competition for its invertebrate food with introduced trout, and damming of mountain rivers for hydroelectric schemes. Early recovery efforts by scientists, field workers and volunteers have been summarised in a project sponsored by Genesis Energy, the Central North Island Blue Duck Charitable Conservation Trust and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society in 2006. In 2009 the New Zealand Department of Conservation started a ten-year recovery programme to protect the species at eight sites using predator control and then re-establish populations throughout their entire former range. Female whio are especially vulnerable to stoats while nesting, and some populations are now 70 percent male. In one study area, clutches of eggs lasted an average of nine days before being destroyed by stoats, and the one brood that hatched was killed the next day.

In 2011 the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Genesis Energy started the Whio Forever Project, a five-year management programme for whio. It will enable the implementation of a national recovery plan that will double the number of fully operational secure blue duck breeding sites throughout New Zealand, and boost pest control efforts.

<text>Michael David Kenneth Read (born 1 March 1947) is an English radio disc jockey, writer, journalist and television presenter. 

Read has been a broadcaster since 1976, best known for having been a DJ with BBC Radio 1, and television host for music chart series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, children&#x27;s programme &quot;Saturday Superstore&quot; and music panel game &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;. He is also a prolific author, having written over 50 books, including his autobiography, &quot;Seize the Day&quot;. Read currently hosts &quot;The Heritage Chart Show&quot; on various radio stations and Talking Pictures TV. He also co-hosts &quot;The Footage Detectives&quot; with Talking Pictures TV founder Noel Cronin.

==Early life==
Michael David Kenneth Read was born 1 March 1947 in Bury, north of Manchester, the only child of a publican. The family moved from Manchester to Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, when he was an infant. He attended Woking Grammar School followed by a sixth-form college. Later, Read worked as an estate agent, and recorded under various names, including Mickey Manchester.

==Broadcasting career==
Read&#x27;s professional broadcasting career began in March 1976 at Reading&#x27;s Radio 210, where he co-hosted a slot with Steve Wright – entitled &quot;Read and Wright&quot; – before joining Radio Luxembourg late in 1977. Read joined Radio 1 in November 1978 and was soon presenting the night-time programme before the slot fronted by John Peel; here, Read championed new groups and featured live sessions. On 5 January 1981, he took over &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot;.

On 11 January 1984, Read suddenly interrupted broadcasting the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song &quot;Relax&quot;, halfway through playing the single, denouncing the lyrics as &#x27;obscene&#x27;. Read has said this account of his intervention is a myth; the interruption of the record was solely for timing reasons, as he only had access in the studio to the longer 12&quot; version. The BBC had already decided to ban the record from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, even though it subsequently reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart.

Following on from his five-year stint on Radio 1&#x27;s breakfast slot, Read took over a Sunday morning programme in 1986. A year later, he moved to Saturday mornings, and also to a Sunday afternoon series, where he played classic tracks. In addition, he hosted &quot;Round Table&quot; and later went back to it as the renamed &quot;Singled Out&quot; on Friday evenings, in which musicians and disc jockeys would review new single releases.

Read&#x27;s Saturday morning slot ended in September 1988, and his Sunday afternoon oldies series finished in January 1989, when Alan Freeman re-joined the station to host an oldies version of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;, which Read covered in November that year when Freeman was ill. From January 1989 to September 1990, Read presented a weekly series, &quot;The Mike Read Collection&quot;, (which was broadcast on Monday evenings) and remained on the Friday panel show &quot;Singled Out&quot; (which by then had gone back to its original name of &quot;Round Table&quot;); he remained in this slot until 1991.

===After Radio 1===
Read left Radio 1 in 1991 and moved to Capital Gold in London, presenting his &quot;Mike Read Collection&quot;, which went out on a Sunday night, before taking on the weekday &#x27;drive-time&#x27; show in mid-1992, where he remained until he left the station in late 1995. Read was heard on BBC Radio 2 in 1992 presenting special shows looking back at the career of Cliff Richard and playing his music. Read then joined Classic FM, where he presented a weekend series, and had a stint as weekday breakfast presenter starting in March 1996. The following year, he presented the networked &#x27;breakfast show&#x27; on Classic Gold stations around the UK.

From September 1999, Read presented the breakfast show on Jazz FM in the north of England; then, in 2001, he joined Spirit FM in Chichester, initially presenting a Sunday slot from 10am to 1pm before moving to a weekday afternoon slot from 2pm to 3pm, playing music from various featured years.

Between 2003 and 2004, Read presented a Saturday morning slot on the Magic network around the UK. In May 2005, he became the weekday morning presenter on Big L 1395, a station modelled on the 1960s pirate radio station; he has also done occasional stints on Talksport. In November 2008, he took time out from Big L to present the 3pm7pm &#x27;drive-time&#x27; show on KCFM (based in Hull) for a week (10–14 November), as cover for Shaun Tilley. Read became the third former Radio 1 disc jockey to broadcast on the station, along with Tony Blackburn and Paul Burnett.

In November 2009, Read began hosting a mid-morning slot on TotalStar in the West of England. Exactly a year later, Read had returned to Big L with a daily slot from 8am to 12pm, Monday-Friday. From July 2011, he hosted the Golden Hour on More Radio (Swindon and Wiltshire), formerly Total Star Wiltshire. Read was heard on Magic 1548 in the north of England, where he presented their weekend breakfast series, on Saturdays and Sundays from 7am10am, starting in April 2012. He also presented the afternoon slot on Monday to Friday on BBC Radio Berkshire between 1:00/3:00pm and 4pm until March 2015, and continued to host programmes for the station, including a Saturday afternoon slot during the summer of 2015.

In April 2018, Read was the first voice heard on the new internet radio station United DJs, where he hosted the station&#x27;s breakfast slot on weekdays from 7-9am. He also hosted an additional weekly series for the station, entitled &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;. From November 2019, he hosted the weekday breakfast slot, from 7-10am, on London and south-east DAB station Vintage Music Radio for several months,
 but still presented occasional shows on United DJs and returned to the breakfast show there the following spring, staying until November 2020. Read left to join the new line-up of Nation Radio UK from 4 January 2021, and was replaced by Neil Fox in April.

===Heritage Chart show===
Since 15 November 2020, Read has hosted &quot;The Heritage Chart&quot; on Sunday afternoons on the Nation Radio network in the UK. The programme was on originally on United DJs Radio from July 26 to 8 November 2020. Dr Fox (Neil Fox) replaced Read on the United DJs version of the show after Read joined Nation Radio.

&quot;The Heritage Chart Show&quot; is syndicated on other selected radio stations across the UK and around the world. One such example is Enjoy Radio, an online station based in Greater Manchester who started carrying &quot;The Heritage Chart Show&quot; in early 2022. In January 2023, Regency Radio, an OFCOM-licensed station on the south coast broadcasting on DAB in the Brighton area, as well on app, online and on smart speaker took the Chart Show on Sunday nights from 5-7pm, the traditional time of the BBC Radio 1 and ILR chart shows.

====Heritage Chart Radio====
&quot;The Heritage Chart Show&quot; expanded from a weekly chart show to a full-time radio service, with presenters including former Yell! singer Daniel James, who has a show called &quot;Bangers and Chat&quot;, and rockabilly guitarist Darrel Higham. The station also picked up the radio broadcasts of Rewind TV&#x27;s &quot;Stereo Underground&quot; programme, a show Richard Latto used to present on various BBC Local Radio stations and hired Dave Lee Travis for weekly Sunday morning show, due to start in March 2025.

====Other radio shows====
On 12 April 2021, Read started hosting the breakfast show on Downforce Radio, broadcasting from 7-10am.

In 2022, Read started presenting his &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; show on the Sussex station V2 Radio.

From 1 August 2022, Read continued his breakfast show, but also with an audience from Sunshine Radio Online, with a dual broadcast-type arrangement.

From 22 April 2024, Read started presenting the breakfast show on Regency Radio.

===Television===
Read combined his radio work with a second career as a television presenter. He hosted the Yorkshire Television children&#x27;s series &quot;Pop Quest&quot; from 1977 to 1979; then, on BBC1, Read presented or co-presented 65 editions of the music chart series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; from 9 November 1978 to 28 December 1989.

From 1982 to 1987, Read presented the BBC&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;Saturday Superstore&quot;, as well as the Saturday night music game show &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, which regularly got audiences of 10 million and featured rock and pop stars answering music trivia questions; the series spawned board game and computer game spin-offs. The penultimate episode of &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, in 1984, featured a face-off between pop bands Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran. The format was revived twice: firstly in 1994 by the BBC with Chris Tarrant as the host; and then in June 2008, a revamped &quot;Pop Quiz&quot; recorded without a studio audience and in a pub (rather than a television studio) in which the participants were members of the public, aired on Red TV; this was again hosted by Read. In 1994, he returned to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to host a one-off special for its anniversary. Later, in 1997, he presented the UK Gold television genre quiz &quot;Goldmaster&quot; in 1997.

In 2004, Read was one of the contestants recruited for the jungle-based ITV reality series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, though his stay in the Australian outback was short-lived, as he was the first celebrity to be evicted by the viewing public. Read was among 10 former presenters who returned as guest co-presenters for the final edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, broadcast 30 July 2006 on BBC Two.

Read has also appeared as a regular newspaper reviewer for Sky News. In 2014, he appeared as himself in BBC Four spoof docudrama &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot;.

In 2021, he joined Talking Pictures TV founder Noel Cronin on the channel&#x27;s archive programme &quot;The Footage Detectives&quot;, a series which discusses forgotten films and lost TV shows such as &quot;The Barnstormers&quot; from 1964.

, &quot;The Heritage Chart Show with Mike Read&quot; is broadcast on Sundays, first by the Local TV network of channels at 7pm, and then by Talking Pictures TV as a late-night repeat. The programme is a pop music countdown of videos and live performances from veteran acts, such as Chesney Hawkes and Tight Fit, based on the chart broadcast on a number of community radio stations in the UK and abroad.

===Song-writing===
In 1979, Read wrote and performed the pop-punk song &quot;High Rise&quot; (upon which his Radio 1 intro jingle was subsequently based) under the guise of The Trainspotters, following this in 1980 with &quot;My Town&quot;, by his next studio group, The Ghosts. Read then wrote lyrics to the theme (composed by Simon May) for the TRIC Award-winning &quot;Trainer&quot;; the resulting UK Top 30 single, &quot;More to Life&quot;, was performed by Cliff Richard. In 1991, Read also provided a guest rap on &quot;Radio Wall of Sound&quot;, UK Top 30 hit for Slade.

After his appearance on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, Read recorded a charity single when he lyrically re-worked the Hank Mizell hit &quot;Jungle Rock&quot; and – as the Jungle Boys (with fellow &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; contestants Neil &#x27;Razor&#x27; Ruddock and Lord Brocket) – had a UK Top 30 hit single. The follow-up, which made the Top 75, was a new version of Mungo Jerry classic &quot;In the Summertime&quot;. In 2005, Read&#x27;s song &quot;Grief Never Grows Old&quot; featured on a charity recording in aid of victims of the 2004 tsunami. Performed by an ensemble of artists named One World Project, the single reached No. 4 in the UK singles chart.

Read has written music to accompany many poems written by John Betjeman. Thirty of these songs were recorded by artists including Cliff Richard, David Essex, Gene Pitney and Marc Almond for the 2006 various artists&#x27; album &quot;Words/Music&quot;, and subsequently re-released in 2008 as a double CD titled &quot;Sound of Poetry&quot;.

On 19 October 2011, Read was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his contribution to music.

In 2014, Read wrote and recorded &quot;UKIP Calypso&quot; in support of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). It was criticized for being racist; Read subsequently apologised and withdrew it from sale.

===Musicals===
Read has staged a number of musicals, including &quot;Young Apollo&quot; (a musical about the life of Rupert Brooke); &quot;Oscar&quot; (a 2004 production about Oscar Wilde, which was derided by critics and closed after one performance); &quot;Great Expectations&quot;; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;; &quot;Cliff - The Musical&quot; (which closed after three months) and &quot;Ricky Nelson...Teenage Idol&quot;. Read took one of the lead roles in the &quot;Cliff&quot; musical, touring with it and appearing for a three-month run in the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre. His production &quot;Betjeman&quot; (based on his musical settings of poems by Sir John Betjeman) has occasionally been staged for charities, including the Royal Marsden Hospital and Children With Leukaemia. Actors appearing in his musicals and shows have included Nyree Dawn Porter, Brian Glover, Colin Baker, Anton Rogers, Jeremy Irons, Alvin Stardust and Bernard Cribbins.

===Books and poetry===
Read was one of the founder editors of the UK chart reference series &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot;, and also co-wrote other Guinness music books.

Read&#x27;s poetry books include &quot;The Aldermoor Poems&quot;, &quot;Elizabethan Dragonflies&quot;, &quot;A Room With Books&quot; and the latest, &quot;New Poems for Old Paintings&quot;. He has edited and supplied biographies for the two best-selling poetry books, &quot;100 Favourite Poems&quot; and &quot;100 Favourite Humorous Poems&quot;, and contributed to many of the titles in the series &quot;Poets&#x27; England&quot;. He has also written two crime novels. In 1997, he published &quot;Forever England: The Life of Rupert Brooke&quot;.

===Contemporary art===
In October 2007, Read started to produce contemporary art, with a gallery of works in the medium of confectionery entitled &quot;Choc Art&quot;. The work includes recreations of album sleeves by the Beatles, his own take on the famous map of the London Underground, and works based on the paintings of L.S. Lowry.

==Personal life and ventures==
===Stalker===
Read had a stalker who had changed her name to Blue Tulip Rose Read and believed that she was married to him. Rose was from Welwyn Garden City and her original name was Carol Ballard. She was featured in a 1996 film made by Jaine Green for Channel 4, entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Your Number One Fan&quot;. The film formed part of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Fame Factor&quot; season, which examined the dark side of fame. Rose was one of the most candid interviewees in the film. She was filmed as she travelled to the offices of Classic FM, and as she wrote &quot;love letters&quot; to Read. The film stated that Rose had been writing obscene and threatening letters to Read for many years.

===Politics===
Having spoken three times at Conservative Party conferences, including entertaining guests at a Tory conference dinner in 2006 with a ten-minute political rap, Read said that he was asked to run for the Conservative Party nomination for the London Mayoral elections in 2008. He subsequently announced that he was instead putting his energies behind the ultimately successful candidate Boris Johnson.

On 21 July 2012, Read spoke at the UK Independence Party&#x27;s South East regional Conference in Frimley, where he was also announced as a member of the party. Read has since spoken at the UKIP 2012 Annual Conference at Birmingham Town Hall on 21 September.

Read wrote and recorded a song in support of the party, &quot;UKIP Calypso&quot;, which was released in October 2014 as a single credited to The Independents. An online petition was filed by former Labour borough councillor Richard McKenzie in which he called Read&#x27;s song &#x27;racist and offensive&#x27;. Party leader Nigel Farage endorsed it and called for the party&#x27;s supporters to download the song. Read adopted a faux-Jamaican accent, but said that it was &#x27;not remotely racist&#x27; to do so, saying: &#x27;It&#x27;s a satire and a bit of fun. It&#x27;s not terribly serious. It wouldn&#x27;t have sounded very good sung in a Surrey accent.&#x27; Debate over the single featured on &quot;Newsnight&quot;, with UKIP spokesman Winston McKenzie, himself of Caribbean origin, praising the song and likening it to adaptations of predominantly black musical styles by Elvis Presley and The Beatles, although the BBC Asian Network&#x27;s Nihal was critical of it. Read withdrew the song from sale on 22 October 2014 and apologised &#x27;unreservedly&#x27; for the fact that it had &#x27;unintentionally caused offence&#x27;. On 26 October 2014, the song reached number 44 on the UK Singles Chart.

===The Rupert Brooke Society===
In 1999, Read founded the Rupert Brooke Society of which he was chairman for a few years, as well as editing the society&#x27;s twice-yearly magazine and creating a museum at The Orchard tea room in Grantchester.

===Charity work===
In 2013, Read and three friends formed the British Plaque Trust, a charity established to commemorate deceased achievers in show business, sport and the general arts by unveiling blue plaques on buildings with which they were associated. The organisation aimed to act alongside the work in London of English Heritage who stated that they were &quot;restructuring&quot; their plaque scheme.

In the same year, he was one of the event presenters at Concert at the Kings in All Cannings, Wiltshire.

<text>Black Mountain is the highest mountain peak in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, United States, with a summit elevation of above mean sea level and a top-to-bottom height of over . The summit is located at approximately in Harlan County, Kentucky near the Virginia border, just above the towns of Lynch, Kentucky and Appalachia, Virginia.

==Description==

Route 160 east of Lynch and west of Appalachia crosses the mountain. The summit is reached by a narrow road that turns off to the right (coming from Lynch or to the left, if coming from Appalachia) at the Kentucky-Virginia line (the gap that is the highest part of Route 160) and leads past a Federal Aviation Administration radar dome. There is a one lane dirt road to the left not far past the radar dome that leads to the summit. The summit is marked with an abandoned metal fire lookout tower (the cab and wooden steps are missing from the tower). There are also multiple radio towers along with transmitter buildings around the summit and a National Geodetic Survey benchmark is located on a large rock over the hill to the left of the fire tower. This benchmark is below the highest point; a second is directly under the old lookout tower, marking the latest survey of the highest natural point.

The FAA Radar dome is nearby, but below the summit. Trees on both sides of the radar dome have been cleared, so views of other mountains are visible. On a clear day the Great Smoky Mountains on the Tennessee and North Carolina border are clearly visible.

Black Mountain&#x27;s history is intimately tied to the coal mining of the surrounding region. Lynch, Kentucky, was once one of the largest coal mining towns in the nation. In 1998, Jericol Mining, Inc., petitioned to use mountaintop removal methods in the area of Black Mountain. Though the summit itself was not directly threatened, many people protested this action due to the peak&#x27;s status as the state&#x27;s highest point. In 1999, Kentucky purchased mineral and timber rights to the summit and prevented future large scale mining. Coal companies have alleged that mined coal veins converge beneath the summit of Black Mountain and that the summit is prone to collapse.

A coal company named Penn Virginia Resources of Radnor, Pennsylvania formerly owned the summit, but allowed public access with the completion of a waiver. Now, however, the Commonwealth of Kentucky owns the land and no waiver is required.

==Ecology==
Black Mountain is one of the few sites in Kentucky supporting a Northern Hardwood Forest at higher elevations. Numerous rare plants are found here, including Red Elderberry and Hobblebush. Like many areas of Northern Hardwood Forest in Southern Appalachia, fires swept across the mountain after intense logging. Black Mountain has a documented fire that occurred in the fall of 1896.

* Required waiver for summit access Note: &quot;The waiver has a drawing that shows the elevation of Black Mountain as . As shown on the USGS website, this is incorrect. The correct elevation is at the summit. A USGS benchmark is located on a large rock over the hill at , but it is not on the summit. The summit is apparently under the old fire lookout tower.&quot;

<text>In Christianity, the word of knowledge is a spiritual gift listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8. It has been associated with the ability to teach the faith, but also with forms of revelation similar to prophecy. It is closely related to another spiritual gift, the word of wisdom.

==Description==
Throughout church history, this gift has often been viewed as a teaching gift and connected with being able to understand scriptural truth. &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defines it as &quot;the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity&quot;.

Among Pentecostal and some Charismatic Christians, the word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what God is currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person. It can also be defined as knowing the secrets of another person&#x27;s heart. Through this revelation, it is believed that God encourages the faith of the believer to receive the healing or comfort that God offers. For example, in a public gathering, a person who claims to have the gift of knowledge may describe a medical problem and ask anyone suffering from the described problem to identify themselves and receive an effective prayer for healing. According to this definition, the word of knowledge is a form of revelation similar to prophecy or a type of discernment.

<doc id="984167" wikidata="Q837636" url="?curid=984167" title="Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal">
<text>The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (HKCFA) is the final appellate court of Hong Kong. It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, replacing the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in Articles 19 and 85 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, the Court of Final Appeal &quot;exercises judicial power in the Region independently and free from any interference.&quot; The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the detailed functions and procedures of the court.

The court meets in the Court of Final Appeal Building located in Central, Hong Kong.

== Role of the court ==
From the 1840s to 30 June 1997, Hong Kong was a British Dependent Territory, and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People&#x27;s Republic of China was on 1 July 1997. Based on the one country, two systems principle, Hong Kong retains a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in Central, Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the court of last resort; the court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.

However, this power is not absolute; the court&#x27;s decisions can be overturned by the Chinese government via a controversial process known as an &quot;interpretation&quot; via Article 158 of the Basic Law.

The Court of Final Appeal has no original jurisdiction; an appeal has to originate from the High Court (either from the Court of Appeal or the Court of First Instance).

== Court structure ==
=== Judges ===
The Court of Final Appeal is made up of the Chief Justice, at least three Permanent Judges, and at most 30 non-permanent Judges who can come from Hong Kong or any overseas Common Law jurisdictions. Under the Basic Law, the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the special administrative region remains a common law jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law; to date, Judges appointed have served in the judiciaries of England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Scotland. Aside from the Chief Justice, there is no nationality requirement for any of the permanent or non-permanent judges.

===Judicial assistants===
Since 2009, under the auspices of the then-Chief Justice Andrew Li, judicial assistants have been appointed to provide support and assistance to its judges.

=== Registrar ===

There is also a registrar attached to the Court of Final Appeal, to help with review of appeal applications and other administrative duties; the registrar is usually recruited from the district court level. The list of registrars is as follows:

# Edward Timothy Starbuck Woolley (1997–1999)
# &quot;Christopher Chan Cheuk (1999–2000, acting)&quot;
# &quot;Betty Kwan Ka-ching (2000–2002, acting)&quot;
# &quot;Queeny Au-yeung Kwai-yue (2002–2007, acting)&quot;
# Simon Kwang Cheok-weung (2014–2018; acting from August 2007 to March 2014)
# Wong King-wah (since June 2023; acting from September 2018 to May 2023)

== Procedure ==

=== Permitting an appeal ===
Whether a prospective appellant is permitted to appeal or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge not be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels.

=== Hearing an appeal ===
All appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice&#x27;s place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic), two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court or, or the overseas judge may sit via video conferencing.

As the role of a non-permanent judge is not a full time role, a serving High Court judge may be appointed as a non-permanent judge concurrently, such as Vice-President Robert Tang and Vice-President Frank Stock, as they were then known. This is extended only to the most eminent and senior serving High Court justices. There is no mandatory retirement age for a non-permanent judge.

Since the enactment of the National Security Law in 2020, no foreign non-permanent judges has sat during a National Security case, being replaced instead by designated Hong Kong non-permanent judges (not all local non-permanent judges are allowed to sit on NSL cases). As there is no nationality requirement regarding the judges that are eligible for designation as designated judges, it is remains unclear whether overseas NPJs have not participated because they have not been designated for such cases or because they have declined to do so. 

== Current court ==

=== The Cheung Court ===
The Cheung Court began on 11 January 2021, when Andrew Cheung began his tenure as the 3rd Chief Justice. Currently, 14 justices serve on the Cheung Court, including the Chief Justice, 3 Permanent Judges, and 10 non-permanent judges (6 of whom are from other common law jurisdictions). It is the first court to be led by a Chief Justice who did not receive a legal degree in the United Kingdom; Andrew Cheung received his LLB from the University of Hong Kong and the LLM from Harvard Law School. It is also the first court to be led by a Chief Justice who has never taken Silk (appointed as either QC/KC or SC). Andrew Cheung has been described as a &quot;conservative&quot;, in contrast to his relatively liberal predecessors as Chief Justice. Nonetheless, the Cheung court has seen a number of liberal decisions, especially in the field of LGBT rights.

Cheung assumed the role of Chief Justice in the wake of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and immediately following the enactment of the highly controversial 2020 Hong Kong national security law. As a result, Cheung&#x27;s tenure as Chief Justice has been underlaid by concerns regarding the rule of law in Hong Kong and the independence of Hong Kong&#x27;s judiciary, with a record number of overseas non-permanent judges stepping down from the court between 2021 and 2024. That said, during Cheung&#x27;s tenure, two overseas non-permanent judges, Patrick Keane and James Allsop, have joined the CFA, and a number of other overseas non-permanent judges have also renewed their appointments. 

==== Permanent members of the court ====
*The Hon. Chief Justice Andrew Cheung (since January 2021; first appointed Permanent Judge in October 2018)
*The Hon. Mr. Justice Roberto Ribeiro (since September 2000)
*The Hon. Mr. Justice Joseph Fok (since October 2013)
*The Hon. Mr. Justice Johnson Lam (since July 2021)

==== Notable rulings of the court ====
The Cheung Court was the first CFA bench to hear substantive final appeals arising from the 2020 National Security Law. The Cheung Court have issued landmark decisions on Hong Kong courts&#x27; competency to review acts of the national legislature, LGBT rights, the Bill of Rights, national security, the freedom of expression and assembly, the freedom of the press, and commercial law. Major decisions of the Cheung court include:

* &quot;HKSAR v. Lai Chee Ying&quot; (2021): In a &quot;per curiam&quot; decision, the Court displaced the presumption of bail in common law and the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, holding that, with regard to national security offences, the NSL carves out a specific exception from the bail regime; the presumption in Article 42(2) of the NSL being that no bail should be granted. Hong Kong courts can only consider granting bail if the court finds sufficient grounds to believe that the accused would not continue to commit offences endangering national security.
* &quot;Secretary for Justice v Timothy Wynn Owen KC&quot; (2021): This was a leave determination of the Appeal Committee of the CFA, which arose in the context of Jimmy Lai&#x27;s trial under the National Security Law and his application to be represented by Tim Owen KC, an English barrister, for which court permission is required in Hong Kong. Ruling in favour of Lai, Chief Justice Cheung together with Ribeiro and Fok PJJ granted ad hoc admission to Owen to represent Lai and rejected the Justice Secretary’s application for leave to appeal the lower courts’ rulings. The Secretary had challenged the public interest considerations supporting Owen&#x27;s admission in the lower courts, but later introduced a new argument before the CFA, advocating for a blanket ban on overseas counsel in national security cases. The CFA rejected this new argument, citing the principle that new issues cannot be raised on appeal if they compromise fairness or the court&#x27;s ability to adjudicate. However, the CFA decision was later controversially overturned by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, exercising its power under Article 158 of the Basic Law. 
* &quot;Q v. Commissioner of Registration&quot; (2023): In a unanimous decision jointly written by Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ and Mr Justice Fok PJ, the Court held that the government&#x27;s policy of requiring trans men (female to male transgender persons) to undergo full sex reassignment surgery as a necessary condition for altering gender markers on Hong Kong Identity Cards violated Article 14 of the Bill of Rights and was unconstitutional.
* &quot;Sham Tsz Kit v. Secretary for Justice&quot; (2023): In a 3–2 decision, the Court ordered the government to establish an alternative framework for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, with equivalent rights and obligations to marriage, within two years of the ruling. However, the court also unanimously held that same-sex couples do not have a constitutionally guaranteed right to marry.
* &quot;HKSAR v Choy Yuk Ling&quot; (2023): In an important decision on the freedom of the press, the CFA unanimously quashed the conviction of a journalist, Bao Choy. Choy was convicted in 2021 for allegedly making false statements in her applications for vehicle registry records, used to investigate the transport of weapons linked to a controversial attack on pro-democracy protestors during the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests. Her purpose was recorded as “[o]ther traffic and transport related matters,” which lower courts deemed false, stating her true purpose was investigative journalism. Fok PJ held that while the Commissioner for Transport was entitled to require applicants to state their purpose, the phrase “[o]ther traffic and transport related matters” could reasonably include investigative journalism related to a vehicle’s use in a crime — particularly given constitutional protections for press freedom. The Court also found it was not an irresistible inference that the Appellant knowingly made a false statement, as she could have honestly believed her purpose fit within the stated category, and thus allowed Choy&#x27;s appeal. The decision was welcomed by the International Federation of Journalists, and described as a &quot;significant ruling for press freedom&quot; by the media. 
* &quot;C v D&quot; (2023): In a landmark decision on arbitration law, Chief Justice Cheung, Ribeiro, Fok and Lam PJJ dismissed the appellant&#x27;s challenge to an arbitral tribunal’s determination that a pre-condition to arbitrate had been satisfied. This case is the first in any Model Law jurisdiction to address at the final appellate level the extent to which courts can intervene under Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law regarding pre-arbitration conditions. The Court adopted a distinction between “jurisdiction” (which courts may review) and “admissibility” (which courts cannot), holding that disputes over pre-arbitration conditions are presumptively issues of admissibility unless clear and unequivocal language indicates otherwise. Gummow NPJ dissented, rejecting the jurisdiction/admissibility distinction and arguing that all challenges should be assessed directly under Article 34(2)(a)(iii).
* &quot;China Life Trustees v China Energy Reserve and Chemicals Group Overseas&quot; (2024): the CFA addressed the principles of Quistclose trusts for the first time, in the context of corporate insolvencies and restructurings. The case concerned US$120 million injected into SPV1 by the treasury entity of the China Energy Group to repay bonds owed by SPV2. When the funds were not used for this purpose and the Group defaulted, the CFA had to determine if the funds were held on a Quistclose trust. The Court unanimously found that such a trust existed, holding that the parties intended the funds to be used only for a specific purpose and not at SPV1’s free disposal. Ribeiro PJ clarified that an express restriction or intent to retain beneficial interest was unnecessary, while Gummow NPJ cautioned against rigid labels, emphasizing that the Quistclose trust is not a new type of trust. Cheung CJ further distinguished between the parties’ intentions and the legal consequences. 
* &quot;HKSAR v. Chow Hang Tung&quot; (2024): The Court unanimously restored Chow Hang Tung&#x27;s conviction for &quot;incitement to knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly&quot; for her role in the 2021 June-Fourth vigil. However, the Court was split 3–2 on whether Chow could challenge the legality of the police&#x27;s ban by way of defence. Judges Joseph Fok, Roberto Ribeiro, and Anthony Gleeson held that there is a strong presumption in favour of allowing non-constitutional (&quot;collateral&quot;) grounds of challenge by way of defence, and it would take very clear words to deprive a defendant of an opportunity to challenge the validity of the prohibition. Constitutional challenges by way of defence would be allowed as long as the constitutionality of the prohibition is an essential element of the offence. However, the prohibition was found to be proportionate, and that section 9(4) of the Public Order Ordinance did not impose a positive duty on the Commissioner of Police to proactively devise and propose conditions to enable the public assembly to take place.
* &quot;HKSAR v. Ng Ngoi-yee Margaret&quot; (2024): In a unanimous decision, the Court dismissed the appeals of 7 prominent democratic politicians against their convictions for &quot;knowingly taking part in an unauthorized assembly&quot; during a protest in 2019. In his concurring judgment, Lord Neuberger NPJ agreed with the main judgment&#x27;s focus on the Hong Kong constitutional framework but noted that the test for proportionality in restricting fundamental rights aligns with the approach adopted by Lord Reed in the UK Supreme Court decision Abortion Services [2022] UKSC 32. 
* &quot;Nick Infinger v. The Hong Kong Housing Authority&quot; (2024): In a unanimous decision penned by Chief Justice Cheung, the Court found that the Housing Authority (HA)&#x27;s policy of excluding same-sex couples from access to public rental housing (PRH) units and the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) was unconstitutional. The Chief Justice emphasised that the HA’s policies failed the tests of necessity and proportionality, given that they completely excluded same-sex couples from public housing schemes for ordinary families. The HA provided no evidence that this exclusion would significantly impact housing availability for traditional families or their plans. Moreover, it offered no justification for why less restrictive measures, such as prioritising opposite-sex married couples or those with children while still allowing same-sex couples to apply, could not be adopted. The decision was welcomed by Jerome Yau, co-founder of Hong Kong Marriage Equality, who told the media that “the court made it very clear that same-sex marriage is just the same as heterosexual marriage”. Hong Kong Marriage Equality called on the government to immediately end the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage.

== Building ==
From its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the Former French Mission Building, in Central. In September 2015, the court relocated to the former (until 2011) Legislative Council Building, which was originally the colonial Supreme Court (1912–1985).

=== Former non-permanent judges from Hong Kong ===

=== Former non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions ===
=== Number of non-permanent judges from each common law jurisdiction ===
Traditionally, all overseas non-permanent judges came from three common law jurisdictions: the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2018, Beverly McLachlin—the former Chief Justice of Canada—became the first Canadian (and, along with Baroness Hale, one of the first two women) to be appointed to the CFA. 
== Controversies ==
=== Article 158 interpretation ===
The controversial power of final interpretation of &quot;national&quot; law including the Basic Law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC; however, &quot;national&quot; laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong. Since 2020, Article 158 interpretations may also be applied to the Hong Kong national security law.

Article 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of &quot;undermining judicial independence&quot;, an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case of &quot;Ng Ka Ling v Director of Immigration&quot; reportedly considered quitting the top court in protest. The judges ultimately did not quit, as &quot;the justices feared they would be replaced by less independent or competent jurists.&quot;

The Central Government of China&#x27;s power to interpret—in essence overturn—the CFA&#x27;s rulings has led the CFA to be nicknamed the &quot;Court of Semi-Final Appeal&quot; by people such as former Hong Kong Bar Association chairman Martin Lee KC SC, veteran activist-investor David Webb, human rights lawyer Mark Daly, as well as the general public. The term &quot;Court of Semi-Final Appeal&quot; was first officially referenced to by then-Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung as far back as 1999.

In practice, however, the power of interpretation has been used sparingly: as noted by Grenville Cross, since the Basic Law came into effect in 1997, the Central Government has issued only five interpretations up to 2022—approximately once every five years and five months—and none have involved criminal matters. Since the enactment of the NSL, there has been only one interpretation. Kemal Bokhary, a former Permanent Judge (and now Non-Permanent Judge) of the CFA known for his liberal opinions, has remarked: &quot;The very fact that there&#x27;s an interpretation [from Beijing] shows you that the court is independent. Because if the courts are not independent, then they could just be told quietly behind the scenes what to do, and they would do it. But everybody knows that&#x27;s not how it works in Hong Kong.&quot;

Below is a list of Article 158 interpretations to date:

==== Basic Law interpretations ====
* 1999: Right of abode in Hong Kong
* 2004: Modifying the process of electoral reforms regarding the election of the Hong Kong Chief Executive (Basic Law Article 45 and 2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election)
* 2005: Dealing with an incomplete term of a Chief Executive
* 2011: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts
* 2016: Legislative Council oath-taking controversy

==== National security law interpretations ====
* 2022: Granting the Chief Executive power to bar foreign lawyers (barristers and solicitors qualified in a jurisdiction outside of Hong Kong, regardless of nationality) from Hong Kong national security law cases (Jimmy Lai&#x27;s hiring of Tim Owen KC); first interpretation of the Hong Kong national security law and first interpretation relating to foreign lawyers.

=== Kemal Bokhary replacement ===
In 2012, Permanent Judge Kemal Bokhary—known as a leading liberal and dissenting voice on the Court—did not have his tenure extended past the mandated retirement age of 65. His replacement, however, was then-already 65-year-old Robert Tang, who was even older than Bokhary but was seen as more conservative; this appointment was described as a &quot;surprise&quot; by the SCMP. Bokhary himself has said that he believes his tenure was not extended due to his &quot;liberal judgments&quot;.

=== Hong Kong National Security Law ===

==== Designated national security law judges (2020) ====
Overseas non-permanent judges have so far not taken part in full hearings of national security cases brought before the CFA. This was first evidenced in &quot;HKSAR v Lai Chee Ying&quot;, where two local non-permanent judges (Stock NPJ and Chan NPJ) sat instead of the usual combination involving one overseas NPJ. Although Chief Justice Andrew Cheung has clarified that there is &quot;no nationality requirement regarding the judges that are eligible for designation as designated judges&quot; and that foreign judges are allowed to hear national security cases, British non-permanent judges on the CFA have come under increasing pressure to refrain from participating. According to The Times, Cheung’s remarks &quot;will ratchet up pressure on the eight British judges to quit their positions on the court.&quot; It is unclear, however, whether overseas NPJs have not participated because they have not been designated for such cases or because they have declined to do so.

Regarding local judges, as of 2024, two non-permanent justices (Bokhary NPJ and Tang NPJ) have still not sat in on any national security law cases. Again, it is unclear whether this is because they have not been designated, or simply have not been scheduled to sit in on a national security case.

==== Resignation of non-permanent judges (since 2020) ====
No non-permanent judge from overseas jurisdictions had ever quit the Court mid-term before the enactment of the National Security Law. In September 2020, then-non-permanent judge James Spigelman resigned in response to China&#x27;s controversial National Security Law being imposed on Hong Kong, but Spigelman did not elaborate further. In March 2022, both Lord Reed and Lord Hodge resigned as non-permanent judges, citing the National Security Law leading to the judges being unable to &quot;continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression, to which the Justices of the Supreme Court are deeply committed&quot;, whilst emphasising at the same time that &quot;[t]he courts in Hong Kong continue to be internationally respected for their commitment to the rule of law&quot;.

In November 2022, Lady Hale—who had refused to renew her tenure on the Court in 2020—suggested that British judges should leave the CFA, stating, &quot;...there&#x27;s going to come a stage where [British judges] are asked to apply and enforce unacceptable laws, and some of us might think that that stage has already come.&quot;

On 6 June 2024, Lord Sumption and Lord Collins resigned as non-permanent judges, with Lord Collins stating that it was &quot;because of the political situation&quot;, but that he &quot;continue[d] to have the fullest confidence in the court and the total independence of its members&quot;. Sumption more explicitly stated that Hong Kong was &quot;slowly becoming a totalitarian state&quot;. In response to these resignations, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam SC downplayed the importance of non-permanent judges, said that, &quot;... the credit for the fact that Hong Kong has a high level of rule of law largely goes to our local judges; it is not the case that losing a few non-permanent judges will deal a heavy blow to our rule of law.&quot; Lord Sumption then further reiterated that his remarks were not said lightly, and also stated, “I have no desire to engage in a slanging match with the Chief Executive [John Lee], and certainly not with the Chief Justice [Andrew Cheung], for whom I have the greatest respect.&quot;

On the other hand, since the enactment of the National Security Law, Australian judges Patrick Keane and James Allsop have joined the CFA as non-permanent judges (on 6 April 2023 and 24 May 2024 respectively). Former UK Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger (who first joined on 1 March 2009) renewed his appointment in February 2024, maintaining that he still believed Hong Kong’s judiciary was independent, and its legal profession “thriving and able”. Likewise, Justices William Gummow and Robert French both renewed their appointments in July 2022 and May 2023 respectively. On 10 January 2025, Lord Hoffmann (who has been a member of the CFA since 1998) extended his term for another three years, just days after delivering a CFA judgment concerning the limitation period for fiduciaries and unauthorized profits. 

==== Overseas counsel for national security defendants (2023) ====
On 28 November 2022, the CFA – composed of Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, and permanent judges Robert Ribeiro and Joseph Fok – granted ad hoc admission to Tim Owen KC to defend Jimmy Lai at his trial on charges contrary to the National Security Law, and rejected the Hong Kong Justice Secretary&#x27;s leave application to appeal the ruling of the lower courts on this.

Within hours of the CFA&#x27;s decision, chief executive John Lee announced that the Government would seek an interpretation under Article 158 to overturn the CFA&#x27;s decision (as well as overturning the decisions by the Chief Judge and the Court of Appeal). This was roundly condemned by legal pundits, including Elsie Leung and Lord Pannick KC. Even before the interpretation, the Immigration Department withheld Owen&#x27;s work visa, contrary to what the CFA had ruled. This decision was criticized by leading barrister Lord Pannick KC, who frequently represents the Hong Kong Government in court, and also questioned by Jonathan Kaplan KC, another British King&#x27;s Counsel who frequently appears in Hong Kong courts.

Ultimately, Owen was replaced by Marc Corlett KC, a New Zealand King&#x27;s Counsel but who had gained admission to the Hong Kong bar in 2020. Corlett was widely seen as a &quot;like-for-like&quot; replacement for Owen, and showed that overseas specialist lawyers would need to be admitted full-time to the Hong Kong bar before being allowed to participate in national security trials.

==== Proposed United States sanctions on Hong Kong judges (2023) ====
The United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) released a report on 12 May 2023 suggesting sanctions be placed on 29 hand-picked Hong Kong national security judges (which includes the Chief Justice and 3 Permanent Judges), saying, &quot;As participants in this system, judges appointed to handle national security cases contribute to these systemic violations.&quot;

This suggestion was rejected by both the Hong Kong Bar Association and the judiciary, stressing that, &quot;...there is no basis at all to call into question the integrity and independence of Hong Kong judges, whose selection, appointment and discharge of their constitutional role and duties are, and must remain, free from any political considerations and interference.&quot;

Lord Sumption criticised the proposal to sanction Hong Kong judges as &quot;an idea that is crude, counterproductive and unjust&quot;, adding that &quot;[m]ost of them are honourable people with all the liberal instincts of the common law&quot;. Grenville Cross also condemned the move, pointing out that the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index 2023 ranked Hong Kong 23rd globally, ahead of the United States, which was ranked 26th. He further noted that foreign non-permanent judges — including those who have left the Court, such as Lord Sumption, Baron Collins of Mapesbury, and Beverley McLachlin — have consistently defended the independence and integrity of the local judges of the Court of Final Appeal.

=== Maria Yuen nomination saga ===
In June 2021, Justice of Appeal Maria Yuen was recommended for appointment as a permanent judge by the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission. However the promotion was rejected by pro-Beijing legislators. The legislators, who by protocol accept the recommendations of the commission, claimed that she might be influenced by her husband, former Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, whose defence of Hong Kong&#x27;s judicial independence they considered unpatriotic.

<text>Queen Mary&#x27;s Dolls&#x27; House is a doll&#x27;s house built in the early 1920s, completed in 1924, for the British queen Mary of Teck. It was designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, with contributions from many notable artists and craftsmen of the period, including a library of miniature books containing original stories written by authors including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and A. A. Milne.

==History==
The idea for building the doll&#x27;s house originally came from Queen Mary&#x27;s cousin, Princess Marie Louise, who discussed her idea with one of the top architects of the time, Sir Edwin Lutyens, at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1921. Sir Edwin agreed to construct the dollhouse and began preparations. Princess Marie Louise had many connections in the arts and arranged for the top artists and craftsmen of the time to contribute their special abilities to the house. It was created as a gift to Queen Mary from the people, and to serve as a historical document on how a royal family might have lived during that period in England.

It showcased the very finest and most modern goods of the period. Later the doll&#x27;s house was put on display to raise funds for the Queen&#x27;s charities. It was originally exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition, 1924–1925, where more than 1.6 million people came to view it, and is now on display in Windsor Castle, at Windsor, Berkshire, England, as a tourist attraction.

==Description==

The doll&#x27;s house was made to a scale of 1:12 (one inch to one foot), is over three feet tall, and contains models of products of well-known companies of the time. It is remarkable for its detail and the detail of the objects within it, many of which are -sized replicas of items in Windsor Castle. These were either made by the companies themselves, or by specialist modelmakers, such as Twining Models of Northampton, England. The carpets, curtains and furnishings are all copies of the real thing, and the house has working light fittings. The bathrooms are fully plumbed with piped, running water, and include a flushable toilet with miniature lavatory paper. Other items in the house include shotguns that &quot;break and load&quot;, monogrammed linens, lifts and a garage of cars with operational engines.

In addition, well-known writers wrote special books for the house&#x27;s library, which were bound in scale size by Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle contributed the short story &quot;How Watson Learned the Trick&quot;, and the ghost-story writer M. R. James wrote &quot;The Haunted Dolls&#x27; House&quot;. A. A. Milne contributed &quot;Vespers&quot;. Other authors included J. M. Barrie, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and W. Somerset Maugham. (George Bernard Shaw rebuffed the princess&#x27;s request for a tiny volume of his work.) Composers who contributed miniature works for the house included Gustav Holst, Frederick Delius, Arthur Bliss, John Ireland and Arnold Bax, although Sir Edward Elgar refused to contribute.

Painters, including Eli Marsden Wilson, Edith Mary Hinchley and Gladys Kathleen Bell, also provided miniature pictures. Two pen-and-ink drawings by G. Howell-Baker were supplied by his sister, who wrote to say that he had recently died when the request for his contribution arrived from the palace.

Even the bottles in the wine cellar were filled with the appropriate wines and spirits, and the wheels of motor vehicles were properly spoked. Queen Mary&#x27;s purchases brought media attention to specialist furnishers such as Dorothy Rogers, who created needlework miniature carpets for the house.

There is a hidden garden revealed only when a vast drawer is pulled out from beneath the main building. Designed by Gertrude Jekyll, it includes replicas of greenery and garden implements and follows a traditional ornamental garden theme.

In 2024, twenty new manuscripts were added to the house&#x27;s library as part of the anniversary project headed by Queen Camilla to reflect Britain&#x27;s modern literature. Sebastian Faulks, Bernardine Evaristo, Elif Shafak, Malorie Blackman, Alan Bennett, Julia Donaldson, Anthony Horowitz, Tom Stoppard, A. N. Wilson, Jacqueline Wilson, Philippa Gregory, Simon Armitage, Ben Okri, Joseph Coelho and Tom Parker Bowles were among the authors who contributed.

== Reproductions ==

The ceramics company Cauldon China produced a Parian ware box modelled on the house, measuring 9.5×15 cm, and 12.5 cm high, at around the time of the 1924 exhibition. A version was also produced with the exhibition&#x27;s crest applied as a colour transfer, in the manner of crested ware. Some of the proceeds were donated to Queen Mary&#x27;s charities.

<text>Magic was an AM radio network based in Northern England.

==History==
The Magic brand in UK radio originated with Magic 828, the sister station of Radio Aire in Leeds which was launched in July 1990, although no other stations were branded &#x27;Magic&#x27; until the Emap group purchased the Metro Radio group in 1995. It can be regarded as the successor to Great North Radio which was a small network in the North East that consisted of what became Magic 1170 and Magic 1152. Preston&#x27;s Red Rose Gold was the last to be converted to the Magic brand, in 2000, two or so years since the conversion of the majority of the stations. In London, Melody FM was rebranded Magic 105.4 in 1998.

The northern AM stations played Hot Adult Contemporary music. The playlists of these Magic stations predominantly consisted of hits from the 1960s and 1970s, although music from other decades was included in the mix.

The London station is more laid-back and its playlist more contemporary, playing soft adult contemporary hits from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The London station is branded with the tagline, &quot;More music, less talk&quot;.

On 5 January 2015, the network merged with the Greatest Hits Network of Scottish AM stations to form the Bauer City 2 network. The London-based Magic became available nationally via DAB at the same time.

==Directory of stations==
==Television channel==

Following the success of the radio stations, Emap set up a corresponding Magic TV channel which is available through satellite and cable television systems and plays non-stop videos of songs established as typical of the Magic brand.

==Magic albums==
The Magic network released several albums since the formation of the network in the late 1990s. The albums predominantly feature music on the Magic 105.4 play list, but were also promoted on the Northern England stations too.

<doc id="984177" wikidata="Q1393189" url="?curid=984177" title="Fairey III">
<text>The Fairey Aviation Company Fairey III was a family of British reconnaissance biplanes that enjoyed a very long production and service history in both landplane and seaplane variants. First flying on 14 September 1917, examples were still in use during the Second World War.

==Design and development==
The prototype of the Fairey III was the N.10 floatplane, which was designed and built in 1917 by Fairey Aviation (along with the smaller N.9) to meet Admiralty Specification N.2(a) for a carrier-based seaplane for the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War. N.10, also known by its constructor&#x27;s number F.128 was a two-bay biplane with folding wings and powered by a 260 hp (190 kW) Sunbeam Maori engine. It first flew from the Port Victoria seaplane station on the Isle of Grain, Kent on 14 September 1917.

Following tests both as a floatplane and with a conventional wheeled undercarriage, production orders were placed for two versions both powered by the Maori, the IIIA and IIIB, with 50 and 60 aircraft planned, respectively. The Fairey IIIA was a reconnaissance aircraft intended to operate from aircraft carriers, and as such was fitted with a wheeled or skid undercarriage, while the IIIB was intended as a floatplane bomber, with larger span (increased from 46 ft 2 in/14.19 m to 62 ft 9 in/19.13 m) upper wings and a bombload of three 230 lb (105 kg) bombs. While all 50 IIIAs were built, only 28 of the IIIBs were completed as intended, as a new improved bomber/reconnaissance floatplane, the Fairey IIIC was available, of which 36 were produced, which reverted to short equal-span wings like the IIIA but was powered by the much more powerful and reliable 375 hp (280 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine and could still carry a useful bombload. Many of the IIIBs were completed as IIICs.

The first major production model was the IIID, which was an improved IIIC, with provision for a third crewmember and capable of being fitted with either a floatplane or a conventional wheeled undercarriage. It first flew in August 1920, powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle, and initial production for the Fleet Air Arm, together with aircraft produced for Australia and Portugal retained the Eagle, while later aircraft were powered by the more powerful Napier Lion. The naval variants were usually three-seaters; pilot, observer and gunner and the wings would could be folded back parallel to the fuselage for storage aboard ship. In floatplane configuration, carrier-borne Fairey IIIs would be launched from the deck using a trolley and would land on the water upon their return. The Fairey III floatplane could also be catapult-launched from a ship. The IIID had a wooden, fabric-covered fuselage and usually a wooden, two-blade, fixed-pitch propeller. One IIID was built with metal wings and floats. A total of 207 IIIDs were produced for the Fleet Air Arm and RAF (Royal Air Force), with a further 20 being built for export.

A Fairey III floatplane (&quot;G-EALQ&quot;) with a 450 hp Napier Lion was entered into the Air Ministry Commercial Amphibian Competition of September 1920.

The most prolific and enduring of the Fairey IIIs was the final model, the IIIF, which was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification 19/24 for a three-seat spotter/reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm and a two-seat general purpose aircraft for the Royal Air Force. The IIIF, which first flew on 20 April 1926, had a more streamlined engine installation and initially a fuselage of mixed metal and wooden construction, with similar wings to the IIID, although later production aircraft were fitted with an all-metal fuselages and wings.

Over 350 IIIFs were operated by the Fleet Air Arm, making it the most widely used type of aircraft in Fleet Air Arm service between the wars and also the second most produced British military aircraft of the inter-war years behind the Hawker Hart family.

Three IIIFs were modified as a radio-controlled gunnery trainer, known as the Fairey Queen. The Fairey IIIF was also the basis for development of the Gordon and Seal.

==Operational history==

===Early versions===
The IIIA and IIIB saw limited service towards the end of the war, with some IIIBs being used for mine-spotting duty from the seaplane station at Westgate-on-Sea. The IIIC entered service in November 1918, but did not carry out any combat patrols owing to the Armistice ending hostilities with Germany. Seven IIICs were deployed to Arkhangelsk in 1919 by the seaplane tender in support of the North Russian Expeditionary Force. They were used to carry out bombing attacks against Bolshevik shipping and rail communications.

===IIID===
The IIID was operated by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm as well as the Naval Aviation of Portugal (11 aircraft) and the air forces of Australia.

Australia received six IIIDs, the first being delivered in August 1921. In 1924, the third of the Australian IIIDs, designated &quot;ANA.3&quot; (or &quot;Australian Naval Aircraft No. 3&quot;), flown by Stanley Goble (later Air Vice Marshal) and Ivor McIntyre was awarded the Britannia Trophy by the Royal Aero Club for circumnavigating Australia in 44 days. The IIID remained in Australian service until 1928.

Portugal ordered its first IIIDs in 1921. Its first aircraft, modified as the F.400 and named &quot;Lusitânia&quot;, was used for an attempt to fly across the South Atlantic and demonstrate the new aerial navigation system devised by Gago Coutinho, the navigator. The voyage started on 30 March 1922 (Flyers Day in Portugal), stopping at Las Palmas, São Vicente, Cape Verde and achieving the main navigation goal of Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, where it was lost during refuelling. The journey was finished using another two standard aircraft (the second of which was immediately lost in the sea), completing the first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic, 72 days after their departure from Lisbon. The last aircraft, &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, is currently displayed at the Museu de Marinha, in Portugal.

The IIID entered Fleet Air Arm Service in 1924, operating from shore bases, aircraft carriers and floats until replaced by the IIIF in 1930. The RAF Cape Flight used four IIIDs to carry out a long distance formation flight from Cairo to Cape Town and back in 1926, the first long range formation flight by the RAF and the first RAF flight to South Africa. Fleet Air Arm IIIDs were used to defend British interests in Shanghai against rebel Chinese forces in 1927.

===IIIF===
The IIIF entered service with the RAF in Egypt and with Fleet Air Arm Catapult flights in 1927, and with the Royal New Zealand Air Force shortly after. The RAF used the IIIF to equip general-purpose squadrons in Egypt, Sudan, Aden and Jordan, where its ability to operate from both wheels and floats proved useful. The Westland Wapiti carried out similar roles in Iraq and India. The IIIF was used for colonial policing and for further long distance flights. The RAF replaced the Airco DH.9A with the IIIF in the home based Day-Bomber role, and, in the absence of sufficient long range flying boats, used them for maritime patrol duties by 202 Squadron from Hal Far Malta.

In the Fleet Air Arm, the IIIF replaced the IIID as a spotter-reconnaissance aircraft, operating on floats from the Royal Navy&#x27;s cruisers and battleships, and with wheels, from the aircraft carriers , , , and .

The IIIF remained in front line service well into the 1930s, with the last front line RAF squadron, 202 Squadron, re-equipping with Supermarine Scapas in August 1935. The final front line Fleet Air Arm squadron, 822 Squadron retained the IIIF until 1936. The IIIF remained in use in second line roles, and despite being declared obsolete in 1940, some were still in use as target tugs as late as 1941.

===Civil use===
The first prototype III was purchased back by Fairey in 1919, fitted with new, single bay wings and a Napier Lion engine and entered into the 1919 Schneider Trophy race, on 10 September. The race was abandoned due to fog, however.

Four IIICs were civilianized, some with an extra cockpit between the two standard ones and sometimes with an enlarged rear cockpit. One carried five passengers, one in the extra cockpit and four in the rear. One three seat civilianized IIIC (&quot;G-EBDI&quot;) was part of a &quot;Daily News&quot; sponsored multi-aircraft round the world flight in 1922, with Norman Macmillan, W T Blake and cine-photographer G.H. Malins. The aircraft, with Macmillan and Malins aboard was finally lost between Lakhidia Char and Chittagong, but the crew were rescued.

A small number of civil operated IIIDs and IIIFs were used for survey duties in the 1920s and 30s, while in October 1934 a single IIIF was entered into the MacRobertson Air Race, reaching the finishing line in Melbourne but too late to be classed as completing the race.

<text>Slain in the Spirit or slaying in the Spirit are terms used by Pentecostal and charismatic Christians to describe a form of prostration in which an individual falls to the floor while experiencing religious ecstasy. Believers attribute this behavior to the power of the Holy Spirit. Other terms used to describe the experience include falling under the power, overcome by the Spirit, and resting in the Spirit. The practice is associated with faith healing because individuals are often slain while seeking prayer for illness.

==Description==
Sociologist Margaret Poloma has defined slaying in the Spirit as &quot;the power of the Holy Spirit so filling a person with a heightened inner awareness that the body&#x27;s energy fades away and the person collapses to the floor&quot;. Slaying in the Spirit may occur in a variety of settings, including while a person prays in solitude. However, it usually occurs in group settings, including small prayer groups, religious conferences or retreats, regular church services and large healing crusades.

In church services or healing crusades, attendees may be invited to the front of the church or other venue to receive prayer from a minister or a team of ministers. Often, the prayer is accompanied with the laying on of hands and anointing with oil. Those being prayed for perceive the Spirit of God upon them and they fall, usually onto their backs. In most cases, their fall is broken by ushers or &quot;catchers&quot;. Once fallen, a person may lie on the floor face up and eyes closed for several seconds to several hours in some cases.

People who have experienced the phenomenon report different degrees of awareness ranging from total consciousness to complete unconsciousness. They also report feelings of peace and relaxation. While lying down, they may speak in tongues, laugh, weep or speak praises to God. According to anthropologist Thomas Csordas:

Not all incidents of falling or swooning in Pentecostal and charismatic churches are attributed to the Holy Spirit. Besides the possibility of fraud, charismatics may also attribute the behavior to demonic activity. Analyzing accounts of early Pentecostal religious ecstasy, historian Grant Wacker concluded that communal cues helped religious communities determine whether specific incidents were instigated by the Holy Spirit or not. Other explanations of the phenomenon have also been proposed, such as autosuggestion, peer pressure, or a desire to experience what others have experienced. In addition, sociologists note that similar phenomena, such as spirit possession and trance, can be found in other religions.

Joe Nickell, writing in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, observed the use of slaying in the Spirit during a Benny Hinn healing crusade in 2001. He compared the practice to hypnosis, writing that participants &quot;merely engage in a form of role-playing that is prompted by their strong desire to receive divine power as well as by the influence of suggestion that they do so[...] In short, they behave just as if &#x27;hypnotized. According to Nickell, a professional hypnotist stated that &quot;This is something we do every day&quot;.

==History==
Beginning with the First Great Awakening that impacted Protestant Europe as well as Britain&#x27;s American colonies in the eighteenth century, bodily movements became a prominent and controversial part of Protestant revivalism. Supporters of the revivals within various denominations including Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists and Methodists argued that trembling, groaning, screaming and falling to the ground &quot;as dead&quot; were signs of divine power in those who were becoming aware of their own sinfulness. This bodily agitation, as well as the problem of sin and guilt, was resolved through a conscious conversion experience, which was marked by peace and joy.

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, considered falling down and other bodily movements to be natural (not supernatural) human responses to the supernatural &quot;testimony&quot; or &quot;witness&quot; of the Holy Spirit in conversion. Occasionally, Wesley attributed bodily movements to Satan&#x27;s attempt at disrupting the conversion process, but at other times, he described bodily movements as natural human responses to God&#x27;s love. Wesley, George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards all record instances of people falling during their ministries. During the Second Great Awakening of the early nineteenth century, Peter Cartwright and Charles G. Finney also recorded similar behavior.

In the twentieth century, &quot;prostrate trance&quot; became chiefly associated with Pentecostalism and its offshoots. The term &quot;slain in the Spirit&quot; was used in this context as early as 1920 by American healing evangelist Maria Woodworth-Etter, whose ministry was often accompanied by this phenomenon. In her book &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot;, published in 1920, she wrote:

Historian Grant Wacker argues that early Pentecostals replaced the liturgies and sacraments of traditional churches with the &quot;disciplined use of ecstasy&quot;, including the regular occurrence of slaying in the Spirit. Regarding the sacramental undertones of slaying in the Spirit, Wacker writes:

The frequency of slaying in the Spirit and the importance that Pentecostals placed on it decreased over time as Pentecostals attempted to shed the stereotype of being &quot;Holy Rollers&quot; (a derogatory term derived from instances of people literally rolling in the aisles when baptized in the Holy Spirit). In 1989, Margaret Poloma noted that some pastors and even high ranking leaders within the Assemblies of God USA, a Pentecostal denomination, were critical of the practice.

Slaying in the Spirit saw a resurgence during the 1960s and 1970s due to the influence of the charismatic movement, which disseminated Pentecostal beliefs and practices among mainline Protestants and Roman Catholics. During the 1980s, it experienced another surge in visibility due to the influence of John Wimber, an evangelical pastor and founder of the Vineyard Movement.

==Biblical basis==
Christians who support the practice cite biblical evidence for its authenticity and use.

Michael Brown quotes a number of scriptures which he claims support the practice of being slain in the Spirit. Wayne Grudem states that while the phrase &quot;slaying in the Spirit&quot; is not found in Scripture, there are a number of instances where people are described as falling to the ground or falling into a trance in the presence of God.
==Criticisms==
Christians who oppose the practice dispute the interpretation of those Bible passages, arguing that there is no biblical precedent and that the practice may be satanic in origin. Those skeptical of the practice have explained it as being caused by hypnosis, autosuggestion, or peer pressure. Christians who lean toward cessationism tend to refute the claim that this practice is scriptural such as Calvinist pastor and author John MacArthur who argues that the practice is neither described nor prescribed specifically in the Bible and that it is, at best, of satanic origin. Some within Charismatic Christianity critique the practice, such as David Pawson, a Bible teacher and charismatic Christian, who states the closest Biblical reference is the story of Ananias and Sapphira, which has a quite different connotation.

<text>Woodall Mountain is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of Mississippi at 806 feet (246 m). It is located just off Mississippi Highway 25, south of Iuka in Tishomingo County in the northeast part of the state.

==Description==
Located in the northeast part of the state, Woodall Mountain is the highest natural point in the state of Mississippi at 806 feet (246 m). It was originally called Yow Hill. The summit is marked with a National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disk and three radio towers. A sign cautions visitors to prepare for a steep, unpaved, and rocky inclined road approximately a mile in length to the summit.

Atop the hill there is a bench, a high point register, and a gravel circle allowing parking for several vehicles. A wooden observation tower was constructed in the 20th century atop the hill in the middle of the gravel circle. The tower deteriorated over time, with some steps rotting; it was torn down in 1998.

==History==
Yow Hill was the scene of fighting during the American Civil War. On September 19, 1862, the Battle of Iuka took place there. Union General William Rosecrans occupied the mountain and used it to launch artillery barrages on the town of Iuka, then under the control of General Sterling Price. The battle was a victory for the Union although Price avoided capture.
The hill was renamed after Zephaniah Woodall, sheriff of Tishomingo County, who bought it and surrounding land in 1884. Describing this hill as Woodall Mountain is often lampooned by locals. Some nearby stores souvenir T-shirts with the phrase &quot;Ski Woodall&quot;.

<doc id="984203" wikidata="Q2713747" url="?curid=984203" title="Electorates of the Australian House of Representatives">
<text>Electorates (also known as electoral divisions or seats) of the Australian House of Representatives are single member electoral districts for the lower house of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. There are currently 151 electorates.

==Constitutional and legal requirements==
Section 24 of the Constitution of Australia specifies that the total number of members of the Australian House of Representatives shall be &quot;as nearly as practicable&quot; twice as many as the number of members of the Australian Senate. The section also requires that electorates be apportioned among the states in proportion to their respective populations; provided that each original state has at least 5 members in the House of Representatives, a provision that has given Tasmania higher representation than its population would otherwise justify. There are three electorates in the Australian Capital Territory and even though the Northern Territory should have only one electorate based on their population, parliament have legislated that they receive two (by setting the quota for seat allocation using the harmonic mean for territories, meaning only around 1.3 quotas rather than 1.5 quotas are needed to have two seats).

In addition, Section 29 forbids electorate boundaries from crossing state lines, forcing populated areas along state and territory borders to be placed in different electorates, such as Albury in New South Wales being part of the electorate of Farrer, while nearby Wodonga in Victoria is part of the electorate of Indi. The same restriction does not apply to territories, and several current electoral divisions incorporate electors from multiple territories. This is currently the case for the Division of Bean (covering part of the ACT and the whole of Norfolk Island), the Division of Fenner (covering part of the ACT and the whole of Jervis Bay Territory), and the Division of Lingiari (covering part of the Northern Territory and the whole of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands).

The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; sets out further provisions.

==Apportionment and redistribution ==

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) determines the number of members of the House of Representatives to which each state and territory is entitled (called &quot;apportionment&quot;) and the boundaries of each electorate, in a process known as &quot;redistribution&quot;. Such apportionment and redistributions apply to the next federal election, but not to any by-elections. The last apportionment determination was made in July 2020. The resulting redistribution took place during 2021 and was used in the 2022 federal election, which was held on 21 May 2022.

Within each state and territory, electoral boundaries are redrawn from time to time. This takes place at least once every 7 years, or when the state&#x27;s entitlement to the number of members of the House of Representatives changes. Boundaries are drawn by a Redistribution Committee, and redistributions within a state are on the basis of the number of &quot;enrolled voters&quot;, rather than total residents or &quot;population&quot;. The number of enrolled voters in each division cannot vary by more than 10% from the average across a state or territory, nor can the number of voters vary by more than 3.5% from the average projected enrolment 3.5 years into the future. However, due to various reasons, larger seats like Cowper in New South Wales contain 80% more electors than that of smaller seats like Solomon in the Northern Territory. In 2018, seats in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were also abolished, in order to make way for seats in similar locations but with different names.

At the 2022 Australian federal election, based on the 2021 apportionment, there were 151 divisions: 47 in New South Wales, 39 in Victoria, 30 in Queensland, 15 in Western Australia, 10 in South Australia, 5 in Tasmania, 3 in the ACT and 2 in Northern Territory.

==Naming==
The divisions of the House of Representatives are unusual in that many of them are not named after geographical features or numbered, as is the case in most other legislatures around the world. Most divisions are named in honour of prominent historical people, such as former politicians (often Prime Ministers), explorers, artists and engineers. There is also a preference for retaining names used since Federation.

In some cases where a division is named after a geographical locality, the connection to that locality is sometimes tenuous. For instance, the Division of Werriwa, created in 1901, was named after the Aboriginal word for Lake George in the Canberra region. However, Werriwa has not contained Lake George for many decades, and has steadily moved some 200 km north to the south-western suburbs of Sydney over the past century.

<text>The 2001 Australian Grand Prix (officially the LXVI Qantas Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 4 March 2001 at the Albert Park Circuit in Albert Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, before a crowd of 128,500 people. It was the first round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 16th Australian Grand Prix that counted towards the Formula One World Championship. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 58-lap race from pole position. David Coulthard of the McLaren team finished second and Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello third. It was Schumacher&#x27;s fifth consecutive victory in Formula One and the 45th of his career.

Michael Schumacher won the 33rd pole position of his career by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He maintained the lead until a major accident on lap five involving Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher and British American Racing (BAR) driver Jacques Villeneuve resulted in the death of spectator marshal Graham Beveridge, who was struck in the chest by Villeneuve&#x27;s right-rear wheel. The incident necessitated deploying the safety car. The race restarted eleven laps later with Michael Schumacher in first place until the pit stop phase for fuel and tyres. Coulthard led for three laps until his stop before Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he maintained to win the race.

Graham Beveridge was the second marshal to die from injuries sustained during a Formula One race after Paolo Gislimberti at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix just under six months before. His death was investigated by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), who concluded it was a &quot;freak accident&quot;. A coroner&#x27;s report concluded the organisers of the race, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, were responsible for the accident and it was &quot;avoidable&quot;.

Following this, Michael Schumacher left Australia as the leader of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points. Coulthard was four points behind in second and Barrichello a further two adrift in third. Nick Heidfeld of Sauber and Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen were fourth and fifth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with fourteen points and McLaren were second with eight points. Sauber and Jordan followed in third and fourth with sixteen races left in the season.

==Background==

The 2001 Australian Grand Prix was the first of the 17 rounds in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 16th Formula One Australian race. It took place on 4 March at the 16-turn Albert Park Circuit in the Melbourne suburb of Albert Park, Victoria. The track is a semi-permanent road course. Due to the dust laid on it by road traffic all year round, it offers drivers a low amount of grip. Engineers set up the cars to extract the maximum amount of downforce at the rear and to be stable in high-speed corners. This puts a strain on traction and braking and prompted teams to install cooling devices on the brakes&#x27; rotor and calipers.

Of the 22 drivers on the starting grid, four made their debut. The 1999 Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) champion and 2000 Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya joined the Williams team to partner Ralf Schumacher, replacing Jenson Button, who was loaned to the Benetton team on a two-year deal. At the Arrows team, International Formula 3000 (IF3000) participant Enrique Bernoldi replaced Pedro de la Rosa, who lost his race seat and joined the Prost team as test and reserve driver. IF3000 driver Fernando Alonso was promoted from a test driver role at Minardi to a race seat. Kimi Räikkönen, the 2000 Formula Renault 2.0 UK champion, drove for the Sauber team in Melbourne, partnering Nick Heidfeld. Many observers, including Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Button and the president of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body), Max Mosley, criticised Sauber&#x27;s choice to sign Räikkönen because he had competed in 23 car races prior to his debut and no F1 experience. He took part in a test session at the Circuito de Jerez before 25 FIA commission members for performance analysis in December 2000. Räikkönen was granted a super licence by a vote of 24 to 1 at a FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on 7 December.

At the front of the field, the press considered the 2000 champion Michael Schumacher of Ferrari the favourite to take his fourth World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Mika Häkkinen of the McLaren team was predicted to be his nearest challenger. Michael Schumacher arrived with the physiological advantage as Ferrari exceeded its target of completing more than in pre-season testing. He said he was confident about his chances in Australia: &quot;The F2001 has behaved very well from the first to last day of testing. It has performed brilliantly at Fiorano and Mugello. I can say again that never before have I been able to carry out such a preparation in my career and that sends me to Melbourne full of confidence.&quot; Häkkinen said the pressure he felt at the start of 2000 increased his desire to win the World Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships in 2001 and intended to do his best to help McLaren achieve both titles.

The race saw the return of Michelin as a tyre supplier for the first time since the 1984 season; the company supplied tyres to the Williams, Benetton, Prost, Jaguar and Minardi teams in 2001. They provided Formula One&#x27;s existing tyre supplier Bridgestone with competition for the first time since Goodyear left following the 1998 season. The competition led to the development of a tyre where more of its surface area came into contact with the road surface providing the driver with more grip. This increased the top speeds of cars during pre-season testing and drivers set lap times below 2000-levels to nullify the effect of the reduction in aerodynamic performance and downforce. It raised concerns within the sport about grooved compounds becoming illegal slick tyres; the FIA declined to enforce a regulation mandating Michelin and Bridgestone to restrict the wear of their tyre compounds.

Several teams introduced major changes to their cars compared to the models shown at the official presentations and pre-season testing. Ferrari introduced multiple aerodynamic appendages, with the most conspicuous being fins mounted on the external side section. The team also fitted revised air intakes onto the brakes for improved cooling and air flow deviation around the wheels. The Williams squad vertical bulkheads under the front wing by using the within the wing to allow it to run lower to the ground.

==Practice==
A total of four practice sessions preceded Sunday&#x27;s race—two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions were held in hot and clear weather. In the morning session, Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fastest with a lap of 1 minute 29.056 seconds, 0.312 seconds quicker than his teammate Michael Schumacher in second. The two McLarens were third and fourth—Häkkinen ahead of David Coulthard. Ralf Schumacher, Jos Verstappen of the Arrows team, Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Montoya, Heidfeld and British American Racing (BAR) driver Olivier Panis were in positions five to ten. While the session was relatively uneventful, Ralf Schumacher and his teammate Montoya ran off the circuit; both drivers avoided sustaining damage to their cars.

Barrichello set the day&#x27;s fastest lap in the afternoon session at 1 minute 28.965 seconds. Jarno Trulli for Jordan, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Heidfeld, Frentzen, Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi and Panis followed in positions two to ten. Tarso Marques&#x27; engine failed after seven minutes and laid oil on the track. Both Irvine and Button sustained separate punctures. Red flags were shown after 35 minutes when Jaguar&#x27;s Luciano Burti locked his tyres into the first corner and spun. He damaged the front-left corner of his Jaguar R2 car in an impact with a concrete barrier at the corner&#x27;s exit. Burti was unhurt. Frentzen beached his car in the turn six gravel trap with six minutes remaining, and Heidfeld damaged his front wing in an off-track excursion.

Shortly after, Michael Schumacher did not see waved yellow flags in turn five to alert drivers to Heidfeld. He accelerated and saw the yellow flags in the braking area for turn six. Schumacher lost control of the rear of the car on oil laid on the approach to the right-hand turn six while braking. He spun backwards after hitting the inside kerb and speared into the gravel trap at . The wheels dug into a ridge in the gravel on the outside of the turn and the Ferrari lifted airborne. Schumacher somersaulted and barrel rolled twice before landing upright against a tyre barrier. He was unhurt, and he returned to the area later that day to discuss possible changes to turn six after raising concerns the day before.

In the third session, Michael Schumacher was fastest in his rebuilt car with a lap of 1 minute 28.134 seconds. The McLarens of Coulthard and Häkkinen were second and third. Trulli was fourth-fastest with Jacques Villeneuve of BAR fifth and his teammate Panis sixth. Frentzen, Barrichello, Montoya and Irvine followed in the top ten. Barrichello stopped at the side of the track with an engine failure and Verstappen was affected by a transmission fault caused by an electrical problem. Frentzen spun late in the session and avoided damaging his car. Coulthard led the final session with a lap of 1 minute 27.540 seconds, followed by Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Frentzen, Trulli, Panis, Räikkönen, Irvine and Heidfeld. A brake problem caused Marques to spin into the gravel trap and Michael Schumacher stopped at turn six with debris in his left-front brake duct.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which required each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The weather was hot and clear. After a front camber angle alteration, Michael Schumacher took his fifth pole position in a row extending back to the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, and the 33rd of his career with a time of 1 minute 26.892 seconds, almost four seconds faster than Häkkinen&#x27;s pole lap from the 2000 race. Barrichello in second negotiated slower traffic on his fastest lap; he aborted one lap due to a gear selection fault and was ordered to stop on the weighbridge. Häkkinen, who had pole position early on, had balance problems putting him off the track at a bumpy turn one and took third. Frentzen, fourth, was confident in the feel of his Jordan EJ11 car, ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth, the highest-placed Michelin-shod car. Coulthard, in sixth, twice ran onto the grass due to car balance problems. Trulli started from seventh, bemoaning a deteriorating handling balance. Villeneuve took eighth place, ahead of his BAR teammate Panis in ninth; both drivers reported an adequate car balance. Villeneuve collided with Montoya in an attempt to pass him on the inside, necessitating a bargeboard replacement. Heidfeld in tenth was twice slowed by traffic.

Montoya was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; Bernoldi slowed Montoya leaving turn four and put him wide on his final timed lap. Irvine, in his balanced and slightly heavy Jaguar, set the 12th-fastest lap as debris removed one of his bargeboards. Räikkönen was the highest-placed rookie driver in 13th, as he drove an unbalanced Sauber—a problem his team could not resolve. Alesi was the faster of the two Prost cars in 14th, as Verstappen&#x27;s transmission fault prevented him from setting up his car to achieve an optimal performance and was 15th. Button did not have his preferred qualifying setup following a gearbox change earlier in the day and was 16th. His teammate Fisichella was 17th due to a water leak in his car prompting him to switch to the team&#x27;s spare car, which had a braking problem. Bernoldi, 18th, failed to generate sufficient heat into the front tyres on his car with traffic slowing him. Alonso set the 19th-fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session; he lost around half a second through an error. A strong understeer left Prost&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane in 20th. Burti in 21st had a left-rear suspension failure sending him into a retaining wall at turn five, stopping the session for 12 minutes to allow track marshals to clear debris. Occupying the last spot on the grid, Marques failed to set a lap time within the 107 per cent limit due to his unfamiliarity with the Minardi PS01&#x27;s two-pedal setup. He spun at turn three before driving Alonso&#x27;s race car. Minardi appealed to the stewards and Marques was granted permission to start the race under &quot;exceptional circumstances.&quot;

===Qualifying classification===

;Notes
* – Tarso Marques set a lap time outside the 107% limit, but he was allowed to start the race.

==Warm-up==

A 30-minute warm-up session took place on Sunday morning for teams to set up their cars before the race. It was held in overcast weather with spots of rain that made the track moderately slippery. While he was briefly kept in the garage with a suspected engine oil leak, Coulthard led the session with a lap of 1 minute 30.099 seconds, 0.053 seconds quicker than his teammate Häkkinen in second. Verstappen was fastest for the opening 20 minutes before falling to third. Montoya, Panis, Michael Schumacher, Heidfeld, Irvine, Barrichello and Frentzen followed in positions four to ten. After exiting the pit lane at the beginning of the warm-up, Bernoldi lost control of the rear of his Arrows and removed the nose cone from his car in a collision with the turn one wall.

==Race==
The race took place before a crowd of 128,500 spectators at 14:00 local time. It lasted 58 laps over a distance of . The weather was dry and overcast with the air temperature between ; the track temperature ranged from ; forecasts predicted heavy cloud cover with high humidity and no rainfall. Tyre durability and grooved tread wear were predicted to affect the race and analysis suggested one pit stop was the ideal strategy for drivers and teams. Jaguar isolated and fixed a minor vehicle design fault linked to Burti&#x27;s accident in Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session. They strengthened the double wishbone suspension on all three of their cars overnight. Irvine switched to the spare Jaguar due to a power steering failure on his race monocoque. Button used the spare Benetton; his mechanics remained on the grid to work on the car before the formation lap began, entailing an investigation by the race stewards resulting in Button incurring a ten-second stop-and-go penalty.

When the five red lights went out to start the race, Michael Schumacher made a brisk getaway to lead going into the first corner. Barrichello in second made a slower start and allowed a pack of cars to approach. Coulthard, on the right-portion, steered to the middle to try and hold off Ralf Schumacher on his left and Frentzen to his right. As the available space was reduced going into the turn one braking area, Frentzen hit the right-hand sidepod of Coulthard&#x27;s car sending him towards Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams. He made a second, harder contact that slowed Coulthard. Behind the first five drivers, Montoya made up five positions before the end of the start/finish straight. He carried too much momentum and drove off the track at turn one. Montoya lost several positions and almost made contact with Panis as he rejoined the track. Entering turn three, Montoya attempted to pass Irvine on the outside and the two cars collided, sending the Jaguar into the grass and a 180-degree spin. Mazzacane retired with a broken brake pedal and an engine failure.

At the conclusion of lap one, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 1.2 seconds and was a further second ahead of Frentzen in third. Barrichello challenged Ralf Schumacher for fourth and took the position when the latter ran deep under braking at turn one and fell to seventh. That enabled Coulthard to return to fifth as he had earlier passed Trulli. On lap two, Bernoldi became the race&#x27;s second retiree when he lost control of his car exiting turn two and struck the left-hand barrier. Barrichello recorded an early fastest lap as he moved closer to attempt to pass Frentzen for third. On lap three, Barrichello attempted a pass on the right of Frentzen (who was on the racing line at the time) at turn nine, and the two made contact. Frentzen was sent into the grass; he avoided stalling his engine and rejoined the track in 16th. Barrichello continued in third albeit the toe-in on his front-left wheel was knocked out of alignment. Further down the order, the lightly fuelled Verstappen overtook Panis and Heidfeld to move into ninth on the same lap. Marques then joined the list of retirees with a progressively worsening battery misfire causing the engine to shut down on lap four.

On lap five, a two-car accident led to the safety car&#x27;s deployment. On the approach to turn three at about , Ralf Schumacher, on the left, was about to defend from Villeneuve in the centre. Villeneuve slipstreamed Ralf Schumacher, and was caught out by him under braking. Villeneuve&#x27;s right-front tyre struck the Williams&#x27; left-rear wheel, launching his car airborne and rotated through 180 degrees towards a retaining catchfence and concrete barrier to his left. The resulting impact of more than 30G against the fence, and cart-wheeling along the wall, destroyed the rear of Villeneuve&#x27;s car up to the carbon fibre monocoque. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s rear wing was removed and he spun into the gravel trap. Villeneuve&#x27;s right-rear wheel detached from the car because of a wheel tether failure and catapulted through a access area. It struck the chest of 51-year-old track marshal Graham Beveridge at around , causing the left ventricle of his heart to rupture, as well as lung and liver lacerations. He was killed instantly. The force of the impact catapulted Beveridge backwards and clockwise, resting on his back with his eyes open. 11 spectators were injured by flying debris.

An ambulance was dispatched, and race officials prevented nearby spectators from forcing their way through a tarpaulin to watch medical personnel tend to Beveridge or scavenge debris. Beveridge was transported to the track&#x27;s medical centre and then under resuscitation to the trauma and intensive care unit of The Alfred Hospital, under a protocol established by the local sanctioning body, the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS), and the hospital. He was officially declared dead at 15:08 local time. In the meantime, track marshals cleared debris and the remaining drivers conserved fuel at reduced speed behind the safety car. They swerved from side-to-side to maintain warm temperatures in their tyres. Both Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve clambered out of their cars unaided. Several hours later, Villeneuve admitted himself to hospital, with bruising, muscle damage, nausea and chest pains, mostly due to the pressure put upon him by his car&#x27;s seat belts in the accident.

Verstappen made a tactical pit stop on lap 15 to support his two-stop strategy. He caught up to the field before the safety car was withdrawn at the end of the lap. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field, increasing his lead by two-tenths of a second per lap. There were overtakes farther down the field. Montoya passed Fisichella for ninth, and Irvine overtook Verstappen and Alonso. Räikkönen passed Button for tenth place on lap 17. Button took his stop-and-go penalty on the next lap. He emerged at the back of the order, Michael Schumacher opened up a five-second lead over Häkkinen in second by lap 25. Häkkinen retired from the race for the third year in a row on lap 26 with a left-front suspension failure under braking at the end of the back straight sending him backwards into the tyre barrier at Ascari corner. Häkkinen exited his McLaren with a mild concussion from flying debris striking his helmet and went to the medical centre for a precautionary check-up.

With Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement, Michael Schumacher led his teammate Barrichello by ten seconds and pulled away. Coulthard started to draw closer to Barrichello albeit momentarily delayed by Fisichella&#x27;s slower Benetton. On lap 31, Panis overtook Trulli for fourth as the latter slowed with a misfiring engine; Trulli soon retired. Three laps later, Alonso exited the pit lane following a pit stop and temporarily delayed Barrichello, unbalancing the Ferrari enough to allow Coulthard to stay in his slipstream into turn three. Coulthard steered left and overtook Barrichello into turn four. By this point, Michael Schumacher had extended his lead to 15 seconds and set the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute 28.214 seconds on lap 34. He relinquished the lead to Coulthard on lap 37 with his only pit stop for fuel and tyres and rejoined in third. Barrichello made a pit stop from second two laps later, rejoining the track in fifth.

A full tank of fuel and traffic meant Michael Schumacher fell 18.1 seconds behind Coulthard until the latter entered the pit lane at the end of lap 41. Coulthard rejoined the race in second, behind Michael Schumacher. After the pit stops, Michael Schumacher led Coulthard by 10.5 seconds. He, in turn, was 10 seconds in front of Barrichello, who was delayed by Alonso after exiting the pit lane. Panis in fourth pulled away from Heidfeld in fifth. Montoya stopped on the circuit due to an engine failure caused by a broken oil pipe on lap 41, prematurely ending his maiden Grand Prix. His retirement promoted Frentzen to sixth. Following a period of stability throughout the field, Verstappen passed Alesi for tenth on the 49th lap. Four laps later, Button was slowed by a split exhaust system that burned through the wiring loom. He retired because it overheated his car&#x27;s electronics. Michael Schumacher finished first after 58 laps to achieve his fifth consecutive victory and the 45th of his career. Coulthard was 1.717 seconds behind in second with Barrichello a further 31 seconds adrift in third. Panis was fourth on the road, Heidfeld finished fifth and he held off Frentzen in sixth over the last nine laps. Räikkönen, Burti, Verstappen, Alesi, Irvine, Alonso and Fisichella (with engine trouble) were the final finishers.

===Post-race===
Out of respect for Beveridge&#x27;s death, the top three drivers on the podium refrained from spraying champagne. Michael Schumacher expressed the importance of ensuring he did not push too hard, &quot;Any time I needed to be fast, I was able to go fast, and what is good is that finally we seem to be able to do good starts as well. So all in all, it&#x27;s the way we wanted to be and for that reason we can obviously be confident for the rest of the season, but obviously we know there is no reason to be overconfident.&quot; Coulthard said he felt fortunate to finish second after starting from sixth, &quot;I would imagine the team are disappointed, obviously, for whatever the particular problem was with Mika&#x27;s car, but you&#x27;ve always got to expect some reliability issues in the first race. You hope you can get two cars to the finish, but I don&#x27;t believe any team would put a lot of money on both their cars making it so far.&quot; Barrichello explained he did not battle Coulthard because of an understeer and was told by Ferrari&#x27;s technical director, Ross Brawn, to slow towards the race&#x27;s end because of fluctuating oil pressure, &quot;It was a difficult race since the beginning, because I had all sorts of troubles.&quot;

Sauber team owner Peter Sauber filed an official appeal with race officials against the BAR and Arrows teams because he believed Panis and Verstappen illegally overtook Heidfeld under yellow flag conditions for Bernoldi&#x27;s lap two crash. The stewards interviewed the three drivers and reviewed video footage of the incident before upholding Sauber&#x27;s protest. Panis and Verstappen incurred a 25-second time penalty and dropped from fourth to seventh and ninth to tenth, respectively. This promoted Heidfeld to fourth, Frentzen to fifth and Räikkönen into sixth. Panis argued the stewards made an incorrect decision because he felt Heidfeld was overtaken in an area where there were no yellow flags, &quot;What makes me furious is that I was found guilty without any evidence. There was no report from the track marshals and it was all based on accusations made by Nick Heidfeld. It was his word against mine and they said he was right.&quot;

Frentzen felt he missed the chance of taking a podium finish due to the collision with Barrichello albeit unangry about it, saying, &quot;At the end of the day I took away two points for a fifth place spot which, considering how the race went for me, was still pretty good. However, I could have easily been in second place had things gone my way.&quot; Barrichello argued Frentzen went towards him and affected the toe-in of his left-front wheel. Frentzen chose not complain about the contact saying, &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t help anything and I am sure that he is sorry for what he did, especially as it upset the handling of his car for the rest of the race.&quot; Räikkönen was praised by the press and Sauber personnel for his performance. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Richard Williams wrote Räikkönen had possibly the best Formula One début of any driver since Villeneuve moved from CART and finished second at the 1996 Australian Grand Prix. David Tremayne of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; felt Räikkönen &quot;did not put a wheel wrong all weekend.&quot; Jacky Eeckelaert, Räikkönen&#x27;s race engineer, said the driver &quot;drove a perfect three days, like a driver who&#x27;s been doing it for 10 years&quot; and Heidfeld stated he was happy for his teammate.

Five days after the race, Frentzen wrote on his website he was suspicious that Sauber illegally used traction control (a driver aid outlawed after the 1993 championship, which was permitted from the fifth round of the 2001 season, the Spanish Grand Prix) on their cars to get an unfair advantage. He clarified his comments three days later to say the Sauber&#x27;s fast acceleration out of the tight corners was achieved by an engine software package lowering its power and eliminating wheelspin, &quot;It cannot be ignored that something like that exists, there is simply no room for discussion about that. On the other hand, however, you can discuss if the device that exists is legal or illegal.&quot; Michael Schumacher responded by saying Frentzen had brought Formula One into disrepute and argued the latter should concentrate on his own car and performance, &quot;To make this stupid comment is completely unfair, he should rethink what he is saying. I know he does not say it is illegal but then he has to say that we have done a very good job, not say that it is dubious what we are doing.&quot; Frentzen clarified he did not state any car running a Ferrari engine had an illegal traction control system in any media interview or on his website.

As this was the first race of the season, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points. He was followed by Coulthard in second with six points and Barrichello in third with four points. Heidfeld was in fourth with three points and Frentzen was fifth with two points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari collected 14 points because of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory and Barrichello&#x27;s third-place finish. That gave them an eight-point gap over the second-placed McLaren. Sauber&#x27;s double points finish placed them third with four points. Frentzen&#x27;s fifth-place result put Jordan in fourth with sixteen races remaining in the season.

==Death of Graham Beveridge and inquiries==
The death of spectator marshal Graham Beveridge overshadowed the race. He was the first track marshal to die from injuries sustained during a Formula One race since Paolo Gislimberti at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix. He predeceased his wife and three adult children. At the request of his family, his death was not made public during the event, and Michael Schumacher announced Beveridge had died, at the post-race press conference. The day after the race, Beveridge&#x27;s family spent more than half an hour visiting the accident site and the crash was explained by a race official. CAMS and National Australia Bank formed a trust fund for his family for individuals to donate to, and a subsequent public auction to sell Formula One memorabilia raised more than A$100,000. On 9 March, a memorial service was held at the St. Jude&#x27;s Anglican Church in Beveridge&#x27;s hometown of Bowral, New South Wales. He was buried at the Bundaberg General Cemetery four days later. A park bench opposite turn three was dedicated in his memory at a commemoration service on 9 November 2002.

The race stewards investigated the crash and chose not to pursue any action against Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher. They rated the crash &quot;a racing incident&quot;, with neither driver to blame. The FIA launched an inquiry as Villeneuve&#x27;s car was impounded on the order of the state coroner of Victoria Graeme Johnstone for his investigation. The section of catchfence that Villeneuve&#x27;s right-rear wheel penetrated was stored at the Victoria Police&#x27;s traffic centre in Brunswick. Both Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher were interviewed by officers from the Victoria Police&#x27;s Major Collision Investigation Unit. The FIA&#x27;s investigation was completed on 3 August. In its confidential report, the organisers of the race, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC), were absolved of any responsibility for the death of Beveridge, which it called &quot;a freak accident&quot;, and discovered the marshal was stationed at an incorrect position at the time of the crash.

=== Coronial inquest ===
Following the Victoria Police Major Collision Investigation Unit examination lasting eight months and also absolved the AGPC, on 3 December 2001 the official inquest into the death of Beveridge opened in Melbourne. The FIA severed all formal links with the inquest and withdrew instructions to local lawyers to act on its behalf. The governing body&#x27;s own appointee, the race director and permanent starter Charlie Whiting, did not appear in person or provide evidence by satellite.

During the inquest, the court was told Beveridge was instructed to stand at the fence opening to prevent spectators from accessing the track and it had prevented any further fatalities. The issue over the height of the catchfence was then raised by the inquest. Tim Schenken, a member of CAMS, said some of the fences were raised in height by before the 1999 race albeit he had no knowledge if a formal risk analysis report was carried out to assess the potential danger to marshals and spectators. Following this, a safety engineer was called to the stand. He said the fence was too low and a Formula One car could cartwheel over it if a collision occurred. He also theorised debris could be projected for around past the fence and be launched as high as into the air. A British track marshal told the court this had twice been the case at the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom. The inquest later heard the AGPC rejected Whiting&#x27;s suggestion to increase the height of the fences in 1998 and 2001, something CAMS and the AGPC denied.

The court was then shown a video of Martin Brundle&#x27;s airborne accident on the first lap of the 1996 race which occurred at the same corner where Beveridge died. The manager of safety services for CAMS stated he could not recall any meeting to discuss the crash and no investigation occurred since nobody was injured. Villeneuve&#x27;s damaged car was brought into the court to explain why its wheel tethers failed in the accident. It was told while the car met FIA international standards dictating the wheel tethers to withstand of pressure, three of them failed in the collision. The BAR technical director Malcolm Oastler said the design of the wheel tether was changed following the accident.

On 19 December, the final submissions were made to the inquest. Jim Kennan, the counsel assisting the coroner, argued the organisation that should be held responsible for Beveridge&#x27;s death was the AGPC under the Australian Grand Prix Act, &quot;No one organisation accepted ultimate responsibility for the design – AGPC relied on CAMS, CAMS relied on FIA, the FIA said the local promoter had ultimate responsibility.&quot; Johnstone&#x27;s report was released on 8 February 2002. It agreed with Kennan&#x27;s suggestion the AGPC was the sole company responsible for Beveridge&#x27;s death due to it not analysing the risks to marshals and concluded the accident was &quot;avoidable&quot;.

=== Physician&#x27;s inquest ===
In December 2002, the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria opened an investigation into the professional conduct of three senior physicians who treated Beveridge at the scene of the accident when Johnstone&#x27;s report revealed medical records had been altered to disguise the fact the marshal died at the track. It found a physician was told via telephone resuscitation on Beveridge had stopped at 14:47 local time and he subsequently ordered the nurse who produced the record to delete it. One physician said he had an obligation to transport casualties and fatalities to The Alfred Hospital for their official certification of death. Two of three senior physicians were found guilty of professional misconduct by the four-member panel on 7 November 2003. In June 2004, an appeals tribunal reversed the unprofessional conduct decision on the chief medical officer, who deemed he had committed an &quot;error of judgement&quot;.

<doc id="984216" wikidata="Q688645" url="?curid=984216" title="Mount Rogers">
<text>Mount Rogers is the highest natural point in Virginia, United States, with a summit elevation of above mean sea level. The summit straddles the border of Grayson and Smyth Counties, Virginia, about WSW of Troutdale, Virginia. Most of the mountain is contained within the Lewis Fork Wilderness, while the entire area is part of the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, which itself is a part of the Jefferson National Forest.

The mountain is named for William Barton Rogers, a Virginian educated at the College of William &amp; Mary, who taught at William &amp; Mary and the University of Virginia, became Virginia&#x27;s first State Geologist, and went on to found the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The summit is most easily accessed from Grayson Highlands State Park by following the Appalachian Trail southbound for to a blue-blazed trail leading to the summit, which is covered by trees and marked with four National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disks; a standard station disk marked with an equilateral triangle and three standard reference disks marked with arrows pointing towards the station disk. One reference disk has been obscured by dense overgrowth. Because the Appalachian Trail passes within a half mile of the summit, the area is especially popular with hikers.

==Geology==
The Mount Rogers area contains a unique record of the geohistory of Virginia. There is evidence from the rocks that volcanoes were part of the landscape. Roughly 760 million years ago, rift-related (divergent) volcanoes erupted along the axis of what later became the Appalachians, and one remnant of that volcanic zone, with its volcanic rocks, still can be seen at Mount Rogers. Massive rhyolite lava flows erupted at the mountain during the Precambrian rifting event. Mount Rogers is also the only place in Virginia that preserves evidence of ancient Proterozoic glaciation.

==Spruce-fir forests==
 Mount Rogers is the northernmost habitat of the high-altitude Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests, which are found in only five other locations in the United States: the Great Smoky Mountains, the Black Mountains, the Great Balsam Mountains, Grandfather Mountain, and Roan Mountain. This forest type is one of the few remaining habitats of the Fraser fir, which is found only at high elevations, typically above , in the southern Appalachian Mountains.

These forests have suffered recent declines due to infestations by the balsam woolly adelgid (&quot;Adelges piceae&quot;), a non-native insect that originated in Europe. It first infested Mount Rogers in 1962 and the entire U.S. population of Fraser firs suffered a 67% mortality rate since, although Mount Rogers was not affected as severely as other locations.

Some researchers have proposed that air pollution in the form of nitrogen and sulfur compounds originating from power plants has been a source of stress to the Fraser firs, resulting in an increased susceptibility to the balsam woolly adelgid, but this relationship has not been confirmed.

==Wild ponies==
Mount Rogers and the surrounding area is home to around 100 wild ponies, one of the few places in the United States where they live in the wild. According to &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, the ponies have lived in the area since the 1940s. In 1974, the Wilburn Ridge Pony Association was formed to help manage the herd and maintain the grassy area where they graze.

<doc id="984217" wikidata="Q509093" url="?curid=984217" title="Tom Coburn">
<text>Thomas Allen Coburn (March 14, 1948 – March 28, 2020) was an American politician and physician who served as a United States senator from Oklahoma from 2005 to 2015. A Republican, Coburn previously served as a United States representative from 1995 to 2001.

Coburn was an obstetrician who operated a private medical practice in Muskogee, Oklahoma. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 as part of the Republican Revolution. After being re-elected twice, Coburn upheld his campaign pledge to serve no more than three consecutive terms and did not seek re-election in 2000. In 2004, he returned to political life with a successful run for the United States Senate. Coburn was re-elected to a second Senate term in 2010 and kept his pledge not to seek a third term in 2016. In January 2014, Coburn announced that he would resign before the expiration of his final term due to a recurrence of prostate cancer. He submitted a letter of resignation to Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, effective at the end of the 113th Congress.

Coburn was a fiscal and social conservative known for his opposition to deficit spending, pork barrel projects, and abortion. Described as &quot;the godfather of the modern conservative austerity movement&quot;, he supported term limits, gun rights and the death penalty, and opposed same-sex marriage and embryonic stem cell research. Many Democrats referred to him as &quot;Dr. No&quot; due to his frequent use of technicalities to block federal spending bills.

After leaving Congress, Coburn worked with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research on its efforts to reform the Food and Drug Administration, becoming a senior fellow of the institute in December 2016. Coburn also served as a senior advisor to Citizens for Self-Governance, where he was active in calling for a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution.

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Coburn was born in Casper, Wyoming, the son of Anita Joy (née Allen) and Orin Wesley Coburn. Coburn&#x27;s father was an optician and founder of Coburn Optical Industries, and a named donor to O. W. Coburn School of Law at Oral Roberts University.

Coburn graduated with a B.S. in accounting from Oklahoma State University, where he was also a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. In 1968, he married Carolyn Denton, the 1967 Miss Oklahoma; their three daughters are Callie, Katie and Sarah, a leading operatic soprano. One of the top ten seniors in the School of Business, Coburn served as president of the College of Business Student Council.

From 1970 to 1978, Coburn served as a manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in Colonial Heights, Virginia. While Coburn was manager, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to over 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market.

After recovering from an occurrence of malignant melanoma, Coburn pursued a medical degree and graduated from the University of Oklahoma Medical School with honors in 1983. He then opened Maternal &amp; Family Practice in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and served as a deacon in a Southern Baptist Church. During his career in obstetrics, he treated over 15,000 patients, delivered 4,000 babies and was subject to one malpractice lawsuit, which was dismissed without finding Coburn at fault. Together Coburn and his wife were members of First Baptist Church of Muskogee.

===Sterilization controversy===
A sterilization Coburn performed on a 20-year-old woman, Angela Plummer, in 1990, became what was called &quot;the most incendiary issue&quot; of his Senate campaign. Coburn performed the sterilization on the woman during an emergency surgery to treat a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, removing her healthy intact fallopian tube as well as the one damaged by the surgery. The woman sued Coburn, alleging that he did not have consent to sterilize her, while Coburn claimed he had her oral consent. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed with no finding of liability on Coburn&#x27;s part.

The state attorney general claimed that Coburn committed Medicaid fraud by not reporting the sterilization when he filed a claim for the emergency surgery. Medicaid did not reimburse doctors for sterilization procedures for patients under 21 and according to the attorney general, Coburn would not have been reimbursed at all had he disclosed this information. Coburn says since he did not file a claim for the sterilization, no fraud was committed. No charges were filed against Coburn for this claim.

==Political career==

===House career===
In 1994, Coburn ran for the House of Representatives in Oklahoma&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which was based in Muskogee and included 22 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. Coburn initially expected to face eight-term incumbent Mike Synar. However, Synar was defeated in a runoff for the Democratic nomination by a 71-year-old retired principal, Virgil Cooper. According to Coburn&#x27;s 2003 book, &quot;Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders&quot;, Coburn and Cooper got along well, since both were opposed to the more liberal Synar. The general election was cordial since both men knew that Synar would not return to Washington regardless of the outcome. Coburn won by a 52%–48% margin, becoming the first Republican to represent the district since 1921.

Coburn was one of the most conservative members of the House. He supported &quot;reducing the size of the federal budget,&quot; wanted to make abortion illegal and supported the proposed television V-chip legislation.

Despite representing a heavily Democratic district and President Bill Clinton&#x27;s electoral dominance therein, Coburn was reelected in 1996 and 1998.

In the House, Coburn earned a reputation as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the political center and away from the more conservative Contract With America policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.

Coburn endorsed conservative activist and former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve no more than three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated Andy Ewing, a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote &quot;Breach of Trust&quot;, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn&#x27;s perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office at the time of the book&#x27;s publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn&#x27;s return to politics.

During his tenure in the House, Coburn wrote and passed far-reaching pieces of legislation. These include laws to expand seniors&#x27; health care options, to protect access to home health care in rural areas and to allow Americans to access cheaper medications from Canada and other nations. Coburn also wrote a law intended to prevent the spread of AIDS to infants. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said about the law, &quot;In 10 long years of AIDS politics and funding, this is actually the first legislation to pass in this country that will rescue babies.&quot; He also wrote a law to renew and reform federal AIDS care programs. In 2002, President George W. Bush chose Coburn to serve as co-chair of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA).

During his three terms in the House, Coburn also played an influential role in reforming welfare and other federal entitlement programs.

====&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; TV broadcast====
As a congressman in 1997, Coburn protested NBC&#x27;s plan to air the R-rated Academy Award-winning Holocaust drama &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; during prime time. Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV had been taken &quot;to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity.&quot; He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere. Coburn described the airing of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; on television as &quot;irresponsible sexual behavior. I cringe when I realize that there were children all across this nation watching this program.&quot;

This statement met with strong criticism, as the film deals mainly with the Holocaust. After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized &quot;to all those I have offended&quot; and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated that it should have been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, &quot;My intentions were good, but I&#x27;ve obviously made an error in judgment in how I&#x27;ve gone about saying what I wanted to say.&quot;

He later wrote in &quot;Breach of Trust&quot; that he considered this one of the biggest mistakes in his life and that, while he still felt the material was unsuitable for a 7 p.m. television broadcast, he handled the situation poorly.

===Senate career===
After three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent Republican Don Nickles. Former Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner Bob Anthony joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys&#x27;s 25%. In the general election, he faced Brad Carson, the Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms.

In the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson&#x27;s 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the generally heavily Democratic 2nd District, Coburn swamped Carson in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area and the closer-in Tulsa suburbs. Coburn won the state&#x27;s two largest counties, Tulsa and Oklahoma, by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes cast.

Coburn&#x27;s Senate voting record was as conservative as his House record.

Coburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election. While he already planned on not seeking a third term in the Senate due to his self-imposed two-term term limit, on January 16, 2014, Coburn announced he would resign his office before his term ended at the end of the year due to his declining health.

On April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress) into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014.

====Use of Senate hold====
Coburn used the Senate hold privilege to prevent several bills from coming to the Senate floor. Coburn earned a reputation for his use of this procedural mechanism. In November 2009 Coburn drew attention for placing a hold on a veterans benefits bill known as the Veterans&#x27; Caregiver and Omnibus Health Benefits Act. Coburn also placed a hold on a bill intended to help end hostilities in Uganda by the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army.

On May 23, 2007, Coburn blocked two bills honoring the 100th birthday of Rachel Carson. Coburn called Carson&#x27;s scientific work &quot;junk science,&quot; proclaiming that Carson&#x27;s landmark book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was &quot;the catalyst in the deadly worldwide stigmatization against insecticides, especially DDT.&quot; Democratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her &quot;legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility,&quot; but Coburn blocked it, saying that &quot;the junk science and stigma surrounding DDT—the cheapest and most effective insecticide on the planet—have finally been jettisoned.&quot;

In response to Coburn&#x27;s holds, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the Advancing America&#x27;s Priorities Act, , in July 2008. S. 3297 combined thirty-five bills which Coburn had blocked into what Democrats called the &quot;Tomnibus&quot; bill. The bill included health care provisions, new penalties for child pornography, and several natural resources bills. The bill failed a cloture vote.

Coburn opposed parts of the legislation creating the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Area, which would add protections to wildlands in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Coburn exercised a hold on the legislation in both March and November 2008, and decried the required $10 million for surveying and mapping as wasteful. The Mount Hood bill would have been the largest amount of land added to federal protection since 1984.

In March 2009, those wilderness areas became protected under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, which passed the Senate 73–21.

According to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, Coburn initially blocked passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), objecting to provisions in the bill that allow discrimination based on genetic information from embryos and fetuses. After the embryo loophole was closed, Coburn lifted his hold on the bill.

Coburn had initially blocked passage of the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, which would help to disarm the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, a political group accused of human rights abuses. On March 9, 2010, Coburn lifted his hold on the LRA bill freeing it to move to the Senate floor after reaching a compromise regarding the funding of the bill, and an eleven-day protest outside of his office.

====John Ensign scandal====
Coburn was affiliated with a religious organization called The Family. Coburn previously lived in one of the Family&#x27;s Washington, D.C. dormitories with then-Senator John Ensign, another Family member and longtime resident of the C Street Center who admitted he had an extramarital affair with a staffer in 2009. The announcement by Ensign of his infidelity brought public scrutiny of the Family and its connection to other high-ranking politicians, including Coburn.

Coburn, together with senior members of the Family, attempted to intervene to end Ensign&#x27;s affair in February 2008, before the affair became public, including by meeting with the husband of Ensign&#x27;s mistress and encouraging Ensign to write a letter to his mistress breaking off the affair. Ensign was driven to a branch of Federal Express from the C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress to ignore it.

Coburn refused to speak about his involvement in Ensign&#x27;s affair or his knowledge of the affair well before it became public, asserting legal privilege due to his statuses as a licensed physician in Oklahoma and a deacon.

In October 2009, Coburn made a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Ensign&#x27;s affair and cover-up: &quot;John got trapped doing something really stupid and then made a lot of other mistakes afterward. Judgment gets impaired by arrogance and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here.&quot;

In May 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee identified Coburn in their report on the ethics violations of Ensign. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign&#x27;s extramarital affair and was involved in trying to negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.

====Whistleblower rights====
Coburn was involved in the Bush Administration&#x27;s struggle with Congress over whistleblower rights. In the case of &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government employees who testify against their employers did not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the First Amendment of the Constitution. The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation.

In response to the Supreme Court decision, the House passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007. Bush, citing national security concerns, promised to veto the bill should it be passed by Congress. The Senate&#x27;s version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274) was approved by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on June 13, 2007. However, that version failed to reach a vote by the Senate, as Coburn placed a hold on the bill; effectively preventing the passage of the bill, which had bipartisan support in the Senate.

Coburn&#x27;s website features a news item about United Nations whistleblower Mathieu Credo Koumoin, a former employee for the U.N. Development Program in West Africa, who has asked U.N. ethics chief Robert Benson for protection under the U.N.&#x27;s whistleblower protection rules. The site has a link to the &quot;United Nations Watch&quot; of the Republican Office of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs&#x27; Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security, of which he was the ranking minority member. Coburn&#x27;s website also features a tip line for potential whistleblowers on government waste and fraud.

====Council on American–Islamic Relations====
Coburn joined Congressmen Sue Myrick (R-NC), Trent Franks (R-AZ), John Shadegg (R-AZ), Paul Broun (R-GA) and Patrick McHenry (R-NC) in a letter to IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman on November 16, 2009, asking that the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) be investigated for excessive lobbying and failing to register as a lobbying organization. The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, &quot;Muslim Mafia&quot;, the foreword of which had been penned by Myrick, that portrayed CAIR as a subversive organization allied with international terrorists.

====Criticism of the National Science Foundation====
On May 26, 2011, Coburn released a 73-page report, &quot;National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope&quot;, receiving attention from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Fox News and MSNBC.

====STOCK Act====
Coburn was one of three senators who voted against the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (STOCK Act). On February 3, 2012, Coburn released the following statement regarding the Act:

====Committee assignments====
Coburn was a member of the following committees:
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (Ranking Member)
** Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
** Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight
** Subcommittee on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce
** Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District of Columbia
* Select Committee on Intelligence
* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
** Subcommittee on Economic Policy
** Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment
** Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Coburn opposed abortion, with the exception of abortions necessary to save the life of the mother. In 2000, he sponsored a bill to prevent the Food and Drug Administration from developing, testing, or approving the abortifacient RU-486. On July 13, the bill failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 182 to 187. On the issue, Coburn sparked controversy with his remark, &quot;I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life.&quot; He noted that his great-grandmother was raped by a sheriff.

Coburn was one of the original authors of the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act upheld by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. The act relied on an expansive view of the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause, as it applies to &quot;any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion.&quot; The Act&#x27;s reliance on such a broad reading of the Commerce Clause was criticized by Independence Institute scholar David Kopel and University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who noted that &quot;[u]nless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the Metroliner, it is not really possible to perform an abortion &#x27;in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.&#x27;&quot; When Coburn later called Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan &quot;ignorant&quot; due to her &quot;very expansive view&quot; of the Commerce Clause, his support for the Act was used by Kagan supporters who charged him with hypocrisy on the issue.

On September 14, 2005, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, Coburn began his opening statement with a critique of Beltway partisan politics while, according to news reports, &quot;choking back a sob.&quot; Coburn had earlier been completing a crossword puzzle during the hearings, and this fact was highlighted by &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; to ridicule Coburn&#x27;s pathos. Coburn then began his questioning by discussing the various legal terms mentioned during the previous day&#x27;s hearings. Proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and end-of-life issues, Coburn, who noted that during his tenure as an obstetrician he had delivered some 4,000 babies, asked Roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that &quot;the opposite of being dead is being alive.&quot;

===Climate change===

Coburn was a climate change denier, saying in 2013: &quot;I am a global warming denier, and I don&#x27;t deny that&quot;. He had previously described climate science as &quot;crap&quot;. In 2011, Coburn introduced a bill with Democratic Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, to end the ethanol blenders&#x27; tax credit—a subsidy designed to encourage oil companies to blend more environmentally friendly ethanol into the fuels they sold to drivers. Coburn asserted that climate change was a natural phenomenon, and that it was leading to a &quot;mini-ice age&quot;.

===Fiscal conservatism===
The best-known of Coburn&#x27;s amendments was an amendment to the fiscal 2006 appropriations bill that funds transportation projects. Coburn&#x27;s amendment would have transferred funding from the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska to rebuild Louisiana&#x27;s &quot;Twin Spans&quot; bridge, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. The amendment was defeated in the Senate, 82–14, after Ted Stevens, the senior senator from Alaska, threatened to resign his office if the amendment were passed. Coburn&#x27;s actions did result in getting the funds made into a more politically feasible block grant to the State of Alaska, which could use the funds for the bridge or other projects. The renovations for the Elizabethtown Amtrak Station were cited by Coburn as an example of pork barrel spending in the stimulus bill.

Coburn was also a member of the Fiscal Watch Team, a group of seven senators led by John McCain, whose stated goal was to combat &quot;wasteful government spending.&quot;

On April 6, 2006, Coburn and Senators Barack Obama, Thomas Carper and John McCain introduced the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. The bill requires the full disclosure of all entities and organizations receiving federal funds beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007 on a website maintained by the Office of Management and Budget. The bill was signed into law on September 26, 2006.

Coburn and McCain noted that the practice of members of Congress adding earmarks had risen dramatically over the years, from 121 earmarks in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the Congressional Research Service.

In July 2007, Coburn criticized pork-barrel spending that Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson had inserted into the 2007 defense spending bill. Coburn said that the earmarks would benefit Nelson&#x27;s son Patrick&#x27;s employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the Transparency Act, which was passed by the Senate but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson&#x27;s spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong. At that time, newspapers in Nebraska and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that had benefited Oklahoma.

In 1997, Coburn introduced a bill called the HIV Prevention Act of 1997, which would have amended the Social Security Act. The bill would have required confidential notification of HIV exposure to the sexual partners of those diagnosed with HIV, along with counseling and testing.

In 2010, Coburn called for a freeze on defense spending. Coburn served on the Simpson-Bowles debt reduction commission in 2010 and was one of the only Republicans in Congress open to tax increases as a means of balancing the budget.

In 2011 Coburn broke with Americans for Tax Reform with an ethanol amendment that gathered 70 votes in the Senate. He said that anti-tax activist Grover Norquist&#x27;s influence was overstated, and that revenue increases were needed in order to &quot;fix the country.&quot;

In 2012, Coburn identified less than $7 billion a year in possible defense savings and over half of these savings were to be through the elimination of military personnel involved in supply, transportation, and communications services.

In May 2013, after tornadoes ripped through his state, Coburn said that any new funding allocated for disaster relief needed to be offset by cuts to other federal spending.

Coburn was a fierce critic of the plan to attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act by shutting down the federal government, saying that the strategy was &quot;doomed to fail&quot; and that Ted Cruz and others who supported the plan had a &quot;short-term goal with lousy tactics&quot;.

===Gun rights===
In regards to the Second Amendment, Coburn believed that it &quot;recognizes the right of individual, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms,&quot; and he opposed &quot;any and all efforts to mandate gun control on law-abiding citizens.&quot; On the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which aimed &quot;to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan and for other purposes,&quot; Coburn sponsored an amendment that would allow concealed carry of firearms in national parks. The Senate passed the amendment 67–29.

Coburn placed a hold on final Senate consideration of a measure passed by the House in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings to improve state performance in checking the federal watch list of gun buyers. However, after the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012, Coburn (who had already announced he would not run for re-election) reversed himself and came out in support of universal background checks. Coburn partnered with Democratic members of the Senate such as Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin (to whose re-election campaign Coburn donated money) to determine what a universal background check measure should look like. However, these talks ultimately broke down, and in April 2013, Coburn was one of 46 senators to vote against the amendment in its final form, defeating its passage.

===Health care reform===

Coburn voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

Coburn co-authored the Patients Choice Act of 2009 (S. 1099), a Republican plan for health care reform in the United States, which required the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convene an interagency coordinating committee to develop a national strategic plan for prevention in its first section, and provided for health promotion and disease prevention activities consistent with such a plan, while seeking to terminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The act set forth provisions governing the establishment and operation of state-based health care exchanges to facilitate the individual purchase of private health insurance, and the creation of a market where private health plans compete for enrollees based on price and quality; it intended to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. The act also set forth programs to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse, including ending the use of social security numbers to identify Medicare beneficiaries.

===Presidential nominations to the Judicial and Executive branches of government===
During the administration of President George W. Bush, Coburn spoke out against the threat by some Democrats to filibuster nominations to judicial and Executive Branch positions. He took the position that no presidential nomination should ever be filibustered, in light of the wording of the U.S. Constitution. Coburn said, &quot;There is a defined charge to the president and the Senate on advice and consent.&quot;

In May 2009, Coburn was the only Senator to vote against the confirmation of Gil Kerlikowske as the Director of the National Drug Control Policy.

===Same-sex marriage===
Coburn opposed same-sex marriage. In 2006, he voted in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to ban it.

===War in Iraq===
On May 24, 2007, the U.S. Senate voted 80–14 to fund the war in Iraq, which included U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans&#x27; Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. Coburn voted nay. On October 1, 2007, the Senate voted 92–3 to fund the war in Iraq. Coburn voted nay. In February 2008, Coburn said, &quot;I will tell you personally that I think it was probably a mistake going to Iraq.&quot;

On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act aimed at stemming veteran suicides. The bill would require a report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the United States Veterans Administration to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that despite his reputation as a budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved. &quot;It&#x27;s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,&quot; he said. &quot;If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.&quot; Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said &quot;I object, not because I don&#x27;t want to save suicides, but because I don&#x27;t think this bill will do the first thing to change what&#x27;s happening,&quot; arguing that the bill &quot;throws money and doesn&#x27;t solve the real problem&quot;.

==Post-Senate career==
After resigning from the Senate, Coburn joined Citizens for Self-Governance as a senior advisor to the group&#x27;s Convention of States project, which seeks to convene a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution. In 2017, he authored a book on the subject titled &quot;Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government&quot;.

Coburn was affiliated with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, consulting on the institute&#x27;s Project FDA, an effort to promote faster drug approval processes. He also sat on the board of the Benjamin Rush Institute, a conservative association of medical students across 20 medical schools. In 2016, he became a Manhattan Institute senior fellow.

==Awards==
In 2013, Coburn received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards.

==Personal life==
Despite their stark ideological differences, Coburn was a close friend of President Barack Obama. Their friendship began in 2005 when they both arrived in the Senate at the same time. They worked together on political ethics reform legislation, to set up an online federal spending database and to crack down on no-bid contracting at the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In April 2011, Coburn spoke to Bloomberg TV about Obama, saying, &quot;I love the man. I think he&#x27;s a neat man. I don&#x27;t want him to be president, but I still love him. He is our President. He&#x27;s my President. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95% of the issues, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t have a great relationship. And that&#x27;s a model people ought to follow.&quot;

Before the 2009 BCS game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Florida Gators, Coburn made a bet over the outcome of the game with Florida Senator Bill Nelson—the loser had to serenade the winner with a song. The Gators defeated the Sooners and Coburn sang Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot; to Nelson, who had once flown into space.

===Illness and death===
In November 2013, Coburn made public that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In 2011, he had prostate cancer surgery while also surviving colon cancer and melanoma. His illness led him to resign from the Senate in 2015.

Coburn died at his home in Tulsa on March 28, 2020, two weeks after his 72nd birthday. A memorial service to honor his life was held a year later on May 1, 2021, at South Tulsa Baptist Church.

<text>Benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene (B&quot;a&quot;P or B[a]P) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and the result of incomplete combustion of organic matter at temperatures between and . The ubiquitous compound can be found in coal tar, tobacco smoke and many foods, especially grilled meats. The substance with the formula C20H12 is one of the benzopyrenes, formed by a benzene ring fused to pyrene. Its diol epoxide metabolites, more commonly known as BPDE, react with and bind to DNA, resulting in mutations and eventually cancer. It is listed as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC. In the 18th century a scrotal cancer of chimney sweepers, the chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma, was already known to be connected to soot.

== Description ==
Benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene (B&quot;a&quot;P) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in coal tar with the formula C20H12. The compound is one of the benzopyrenes, formed by a benzene ring fused to pyrene, and is the result of incomplete combustion at temperatures between and .

== Sources ==
The main source of atmospheric B&quot;a&quot;P is residential wood burning. It is also found in coal tar, in automobile exhaust fumes (especially from diesel engines), in all smoke resulting from the combustion of organic material (including cigarette smoke), and in charbroiled food.
A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found levels of B&quot;a&quot;P to be significantly higher in foods that were cooked well-done on the barbecue, particularly steaks, chicken with skin, and hamburgers: Cooked meat products have been shown to contain up to 4 ng/g of B&quot;a&quot;P, and up to 5.5 ng/g in fried chicken and 62.6 ng/g in overcooked charcoal barbecued beef.

B&quot;a&quot;P is discharged in wastewater by industries such as smelters, particularly iron and steel mills and aluminium smelters.

== History ==
In the 18th century, young British chimney sweeps who climbed into chimneys suffered from chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma, a scrotal cancer peculiar to their profession, and this was connected to the effects of soot in 1775, in the first work of occupational cancer epidemiology and also the first connection of any chemical mixture to cancer formation. Frequent skin cancers were noted among fuel industry workers in the 19th century. In 1933, B&quot;a&quot;P was determined to be the compound responsible for these cases, and its carcinogenicity was demonstrated when skin tumors occurred in laboratory animals repeatedly painted with coal tar. B&quot;a&quot;P has since been identified as a prime carcinogen in cigarette smoke.

== Toxicity ==
=== Nervous system ===
Prenatal exposure of B&quot;a&quot;P in rats is known to affect learning and memory in rodent models. Pregnant rats eating B&quot;a&quot;P were shown to negatively affect the brain function in the late life of their offspring. At a time when synapses are first formed and adjusted in strength by activity, B&quot;a&quot;P diminished NMDA receptor-dependent nerve cell activity measured as mRNA expression of the NMDA NR2B receptor subunit.

=== Immune system ===
B&quot;a&quot;P has an effect on the number of white blood cells, inhibiting some of them from differentiating into macrophages, the body&#x27;s first line of defense to fight infections. In 2016, the molecular mechanism was uncovered as damage to the macrophage membrane&#x27;s lipid raft integrity by decreasing membrane cholesterol at 25%. This means less immunoreceptors CD32 (a member of the Fc family of immunoreceptors) could bind to IgG and turn the white blood cell into a macrophage. Therefore, macrophage membranes become susceptible to bacterial infections.

=== Reproductive system ===
In experiments with male rats, subchronic exposure to inhaled B&quot;a&quot;P has been shown to generally reduce the function of testicles and epididymis with lower sex steroid/testosterone production and sperm production.

=== Carcinogenicity ===
B&quot;a&quot;P&#x27;s metabolites are mutagenic and highly carcinogenic, and it is listed as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC. Chemical agents and related occupations, Volume 10, A review of Human Carcinogens, IARC Monographs, Lyon France 2009 

In June 2016, B&quot;a&quot;P was added as benzo[&quot;def&quot;]chrysene to the REACH Candidate List of Substances of very high concern for Authorisation.

Numerous studies since the 1970s have documented links between B&quot;a&quot;P and cancers. It has been more difficult to link cancers to specific B&quot;a&quot;P sources, especially in humans, and difficult to quantify risks posed by various methods of exposure (inhalation or ingestion). A link between vitamin A deficiency and emphysema in smokers was described in 2005 to be due to B&quot;a&quot;P, which induces vitamin A deficiency in rats.

A 1996 study provided molecular evidence linking components in tobacco smoke to lung cancer. B&quot;a&quot;P was shown to cause genetic damage in lung cells that was identical to the damage observed in the DNA of most malignant lung tumours.

Regular consumption of cooked meats has been epidemiologically associated with increased levels of colon cancer (although this in itself does not &quot;prove&quot; carcinogenicity),
A 2005 NCI study found an increased risk of colorectal adenomas was associated with B&quot;a&quot;P intake, and more strongly with B&quot;a&quot;P intake from all foods. 

The detoxification enzymes cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) are both protective and necessary for benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene toxicity. Experiments with strains of mice engineered to remove (knockout) CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 reveal that CYP1A1 primarily acts to protect mammals from low doses of B&quot;a&quot;P, and that removing this protection accumulates large concentrations of B&quot;a&quot;P. Unless CYP1B1 is also knocked out, toxicity results from the bioactivation of B&quot;a&quot;P to benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene -7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, the ultimate toxic compound.

=== Interaction with DNA ===
Properly speaking, B&quot;a&quot;P is a procarcinogen, meaning that its mechanism of carcinogenesis depends on its enzymatic metabolism to B&quot;a&quot;P diol epoxide It intercalates in DNA, and the electrophilic epoxide is attacked by nucleophilic guanine bases, forming a bulky guanine adduct.
X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies have shown how this binding distorts the DNA by perturbing the double-helical DNA structure. This disrupts the normal process of copying DNA and induces mutations, which explains the occurrence of cancer after exposure. This mechanism of action is similar to that of aflatoxin which binds to the N7 position of guanine.

There are indications that benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene diol epoxide specifically targets the protective p53 gene. This gene is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and hence functions as a tumor suppressor. By inducing G (guanine) to T (thymidine) transversions in transversion hotspots within p53, there is a probability that benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene diol epoxide inactivates the tumor suppression ability in certain cells, leading to cancer.

Benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is the carcinogenic product of three enzymatic reactions:
# Benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene is first oxidized by cytochrome P450 1A1 to form a variety of products, including (+)benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene-7,8-epoxide.
# This product is metabolized by epoxide hydrolase, opening up the epoxide ring to yield (−)benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol.
# The ultimate carcinogen is formed after another reaction with cytochrome P450 1A1 to yield the (+)benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. It is this diol epoxide that covalently binds to DNA.

B&quot;a&quot;P induces cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) by binding to the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) in the cytosol. Upon binding the transformed receptor translocates to the nucleus where it dimerises with ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) and then binds xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in DNA located upstream of certain genes. This process increases transcription of certain genes, notably &quot;CYP1A1&quot;, followed by increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eukaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid.

Moreover, B&quot;a&quot;P has been found to activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.

==Nucleotide excision repair==
As illustrated above, (+)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) forms bulky covalent DNA adducts with guanines. Most of these adducts can be efficiently eliminated from DNA by the process of nucleotide excision repair. Those adducts that are not removed can cause errors during DNA replication leading to carcinogenic mutations.

<text>The Reserve Army was a field army of the British Army and part of the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War. On 1 April 1916, Lieutenant-General Sir Hubert Gough was moved from the command of I Corps and took over the Reserve Corps, which in June before the Battle of the Somme, was expanded and renamed Reserve Army. The army fought on the northern flank of the Fourth Army during the battle and became the Fifth Army on 30 October.

==History==
Haig developed a concept of all-arms units of &quot;cavalry and mobile troops&quot; to capture a portion of the German defences and enlarge the foothold for later exploitation. Haig wrote training instructions for the cavalry in March 1916, in which he described a breach being made in the German lines and the cavalry and mobile troops rushing forward to create a bridgehead, obstructing German reinforcements. Infantry would have time to move up to relieve the cavalry in the bridgehead, which would then operate behind parts of the front where German infantry were still fighting and protect the main force by extending the flank.

Haig disbanded the two cavalry corps on 3 March 1916 and distributed the divisions to the armies and the new Reserve Corps. Gough was appointed to command the Reserve Corps in April, which was renamed Reserve Army in June. There was some uncertainty over the role of the army, Kiggell, the BEF Chief of Staff writing on 4 June, &quot;The area in which the Reserve Corps (sic) may be employed must be dependent on events and cannot be foreseen&quot;. Gough was told to train the cavalry in the all-arms concept and to convince cavalry officers of the effectiveness of cavalry, when co-operating with artillery and infantry.

In 1996, Stephen Badsey wrote that the Reserve Army was organised as a &quot;conveyor belt&quot;, to exploit the success of the Fourth Army, with the 25th Division first, followed by two cavalry divisions and then the II Corps infantry divisions. Sheffield wrote that the all-arms concept was an imaginative response to the tactical problems of 1915 and anticipated post-war moves towards mobile warfare, but was ambitious, and the staff work and traffic control required to make it work, would have been a great burden on the inexperienced armies and staffs of 1916. &quot;Gough&#x27;s Mobile Army&quot; was then made ineffective by a disagreement between Haig and Rawlinson about the plan for the Battle of the Somme, Rawlinson wanting to conduct a series of limited advances onto commanding ground, from which German counter-attacks would be smashed. The intelligence picture led Haig to believe that a more ambitious attack could succeed and he insisted on deeper objectives being substituted for the relatively shallow penetration of the German first position preferred by Rawlinson.

The army was intended to carry out the breakthrough and exploitation of the Somme offensive, once the Fourth Army (General Sir Henry Rawlinson) had captured the German front-line trenches. In May it had been envisaged that Gough would stand by to take over the two right flank corps of the Fourth Army but on 5 June, this plan was supplemented by a proposal to move the forces under Gough to the Second Army in Flanders, if the Fourth Army offensive bogged down. The idea of Gough taking over the right wing corps was dropped later in June and the 1st, 3rd and 2nd Indian cavalry divisions were attached to Gough along with the 12th and 25th divisions in GHQ reserve, to operate under the command of GHQ. II Corps with the 23rd and 38th divisions, was to be ready to move forward into the vacated assembly areas. In mid-June II Corps was detached and returned to GHQ reserve and the Reserve Army reduced to a cavalry formation, under the command of the Fourth Army, to give more discretion to Rawlinson as the man on the spot.
In the evening of the First day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, the British Commander-in-Chief General Sir Douglas Haig relieved Rawlinson&#x27;s Fourth Army of responsibility for the northern sector, placing the VIII and X Corps under Gough from on 2 July. Gough immediately left to visit the two corps to assess the situation. X Corps and VIII Corps to the north were to capture the German front position and the intermediate line from Mouquet Farm to Serre. Gough was sent to take over command of X Corps and VIII Corps and the 25th Division (Major-General E. G. T. Bainbridge) was transferred from reserve to X Corps. Gough had intended to attack Thiepval with the 49th and 32nd divisions and the 48th Division of VIII Corps; eventually changes of plan reduced the attack to two brigades of the 32nd Division.

Just before the attack by X Corps and III Corps began on 3 July, Gough revealed that X Corps could not attack before and at noon, VIII Corps and X Corps were detached from the Fourth Army to Gough and the Reserve Army. Later II Corps, I Anzac Corps and the Canadian Corps were added to the Reserve Army. For the next few months the Reserve Army fought the Battle of Pozières and the Battle of Mouquet Farm The Battle of Thiepval Ridge took place as part of the sequential offensives of the French Sixth, the Fourth and then the Reserve Army during September. For much of October, the Reserve Army conducted the Battle of the Ancre Heights and on 30 October, the army was renamed the Fifth Army.

<text>A didactic method ( &quot;didáskein&quot;, &quot;to teach&quot;) is a teaching method that follows a consistent scientific approach or educational style to present information to students. The didactic method of instruction is often contrasted with dialectics and the Socratic method; the term can also be used to refer to a specific didactic method, as for instance constructivist didactics.

==Overview==
Didactics is a theory of teaching, and in a wider sense, a theory and practical application of teaching and learning. In demarcation from &quot;mathetics&quot; (the science of learning), didactics refers only to the science of teaching.

This theory might be contrasted with open learning, also known as experiential learning, in which people can learn by themselves, in an unstructured manner (or in an unusually structured manner) as in experiential education, on topics of interest. It can also be contrasted with autodidactic learning, in which one instructs oneself, often from existing books or curricula.

The theory of didactic learning methods focuses on the baseline knowledge students possess and seeks to improve upon and convey this information. It also refers to the foundation or starting point in a lesson plan, where the overall goal is knowledge. A teacher or educator functions in this role as an authoritative figure, but also as both a guide and a resource for students.

Didactics or the didactic method have different connotations in continental Europe and English-speaking countries. Didacticism was indeed the cultural origin of the didactic method but refers within its narrow context usually pejoratively to the use of language to a doctrinal end. The interpretation of these opposing views are theorised to be the result of a differential cultural development in the 19th century when Great Britain and its former colonies went through a renewal and increased cultural distancing from continental Europe. It was particularly the later appearance of Romanticism and Aestheticism in the Anglo-Saxon world which offered these negative and limiting views of the didactic method. On the other hand, in continental Europe those moralising aspects of didactics were removed earlier by cultural representatives of the Age of Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and later specifically related to teaching by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

The consequences of these cultural differences then created two main didactic traditions: The Anglo-Saxon tradition of curriculum studies on one side and the Continental and North European tradition of didactics on the other. Still today, the science of didactics carries much less weight in much of the English-speaking world..

With the advent of globalisation at the beginning of the 20th century, however, the arguments for such relative philosophical aspects in the methods of teaching started to diminish somewhat. It is therefore possible to categorise didactics and pedagogy as a general analytic theory on three levels:

*a theoretical or research level (denoting a field of study)
*a practical level (summaries of curricular activities)
*a discursive level (implying a frame of reference for professional dialogs)

==Nature of didactics and difference with pedagogy==
The discipline of didactics is interested in both theoretical knowledge and practical activities related to teaching, learning and their conditions. It is concerned with the content of teaching (the &quot;what&quot;), the method of teaching (the &quot;how&quot;) and the historical, cultural and social justifications of curricular choices (the &quot;why&quot;). It focuses on the individual learner, their cognitive characteristics and functioning when they learn a given content and become a knowing subject. The perspective of educational reality in didactics is drawn extensively from cognitive psychology and the theory of teaching, and sometimes from social psychology. Didactics is descriptive and diachronic (&quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what was&quot;), as opposed to pedagogy, the other discipline related to educational theorizing, which is normative or prescriptive and synchronic (&quot;what should or ought to be&quot;) in nature. Didactics can be said to provide the descriptive foundation for pedagogy, which is more concerned with educational goal-setting and with the learner&#x27;s becoming a social subject and their future role in society.

In continental Europe, as opposed to English-speaking research cultures, pedagogy and didactics are distinct areas of study. Didactics is a knowledge-based discipline concerned with the descriptive and rational study of all teaching-related activities before, during and after the teaching of content in the classroom, which includes the &quot;planning, control and regulation of the teaching context&quot; and its objective is to analyze how teaching leads to learning. On the other hand, pedagogy is a practice-oriented discipline concerned with the normative study of the applied aspects of teaching in real teaching contexts, i.e., inside the classroom. Pedagogy draws from didactic research and can be seen as an applied component of didactics.

===Didactic transposition===
In France, didactics refers to the science that takes the teaching of disciplined knowledge as its object of study. In other words, didactics is concerned with the teaching of specific disciplines to students. One of the central concepts studied in didactics of a specific discipline in France is the concept of &quot;didactic transposition&quot; (&quot;La transposition didactique&quot; in French). French philosopher and sociologist Michel Verret introduced this concept in 1975, which was borrowed and elaborated further in the 1980s by the French didactician of Mathematics Yves Chevallard. Although Chevallard initially presented this concept regarding the didactics of mathematics, it has since been generalized for other disciplines as well.

Didactic transposition is composed of multiple steps. The first step, called the &quot;external transposition&quot; (&quot;transposition externe&quot;), is about how the &quot;scholarly knowledge&quot; (&quot;savoir savant&quot;) produced by the scholars, scientists or specialists of a certain discipline in a research context, i.e., at universities and other academic institutions is transformed into &quot;knowledge to teach&quot; (&quot;savoir à enseigner&quot;) by precisely selecting, rearranging and defining the knowledge which will be taught (the official curriculum for each discipline) and how it will be taught, so that it becomes an object of learning accessible to the learner. This external didactic transposition is a socio-political construction made possible by different actors working within various educational institutions: education specialists, political authorities, teachers and their associations define the issues of teaching and choose what should be taught under which form. Chevallard called this socio-political context of institutional organization the “noosphere”, which defines the limits, redefines and reorganizes the knowledge in socially, historically or culturally determined contexts.

The second step, called the &quot;internal transposition&quot; (&quot;transposition interne&quot;) is about how the knowledge to teach is transformed into &quot;taught knowledge&quot; (&quot;savoir enseigné&quot;), which is the knowledge actually taught through the day-to-day concrete practices of a teacher in a teaching context, e.g. in a classroom, and which depends on their students and the constraints imposed on them (time, exams, conformity to prevailing school rules, etc.).

In the third and final step, the taught knowledge is transformed into &quot;acquired knowledge&quot; (&quot;savoir acquis&quot;), which is the knowledge as it is actually acquired by students in a learning context. The acquired knowledge can be used as a feedback to the didactic system. Didactic research has to account for all the aforementioned steps of didactic transposition.

==Didactic teaching==
Didactic method provides students with the required theoretical knowledge. It is an effective method used to teach students who are unable to organize their work and depend on the teachers for instructions. It is also used to teach basic skills of reading and writing. The teacher or the literate is the source of knowledge and the knowledge is transmitted to the students through didactic method.

===Limitations===
Though the didactic method has been given importance in several schools, it does not satisfy the needs and interests of all students. It can be tedious for students to listen to the possible lectures. There is minimum interaction between the students and the teachers. Learning which also involves motivating the students to develop an interest towards the subject may not be satisfied through this teaching method. 
 It may be a monologue process and experience of the students may not have a significant role in learning.

<text>Wulingyuan (, ) is a scenic and historical site in the Wulingyuan District of South Central China&#x27;s Hunan Province. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. It is noted for more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars and peaks across most of the site, many over in height, along with many ravines and gorges with picturesque streams, pools, lakes, rivers, and waterfalls. It features 40 caves, many with large calcite deposits and a natural bridge named Tianqiashengkong (meaning &#x27;bridge across the sky&#x27;), which is one of the highest natural bridges in the world. The site also provides habitat for many vulnerable species, including the dhole, Asiatic black bear, and Chinese water deer. 

The site is situated in Zhangjiajie City and lies about to the northwest of Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. The park covers an area of 690 square kilometers (266 square miles). Wulingyuan forms part of the Wuling Mountain Range. The scenic area consists of four national parks, which are the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, Suoxi Valley Nature Reserve, Tianzi Mountain Nature Reserve, and the recently added Yangjiajie Scenic Area. Overall there are over 560 attraction sights to view.

== Geology ==
The quartzite sandstone pillars and the surrounding regions were formed during the Devonian period (400 to 350 million years ago) from a combination of tectonic uplift and water erosion.
The highest area in the park is Huang Shi Zhai (). It reaches a height of and is accessible via cable car or a set of stairs. Another cliff is accessed by the Bailong Elevator.

<doc id="984232" wikidata="Q223099" url="?curid=984232" title="Methylcholanthrene">
<text>Methylcholanthrene is a highly carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon produced by burning organic compounds at very high temperatures. Methylcholanthrene is also known as 3-methylcholanthrene, 20-methylcholanthrene or the IUPAC name 3-methyl-1,2-dyhydrobenzo[j]aceanthrylene. The short notation often used is 3-MC or MCA. This compound forms pale yellow solid crystals when crystallized from benzene and ether. It has a melting point around 180 °C and its boiling point is around 280 °C at a pressure of 80 mmHg. Methylcholanthrene is used in laboratory studies of chemical carcinogenesis. It is an alkylated derivative of benz[&quot;a&quot;]anthracene and has a similar UV spectrum. The most common isomer is 3-methylcholanthrene, although the methyl group can occur in other places.

3-Methylcholanthrene, a known carcinogen which builds up in the prostate due to cholesterol breakdown, is implicated in prostate cancer. It &quot;readily produces&quot; primary sarcomas in mice.

== History ==
In 1933, the first article about methylcholanthrene was published. Here they described the synthesis of the compound. Not many years later, it became clear that this compound had toxic properties to humans and animals. Therefore, a lot of interest was shown in the compound and it was used often in toxicological research. Methylcholanthrene is often tested on mice and rats to derive information for cancer medicine development. Due to the influence of the compound on the central nervous system, its responses and change in response are compared. It is also known that due to genetic mutations, the compound causes cancer cells to develop. 
In 1982, the last article appeared on the synthesis of methylcholanthrene. The yield of 93% was reached and therefore no further adjustments were made to the synthesis scheme.

== Synthesis ==
First 3-MC was synthesized with the method of reference. Later the synthesis of the compound was improved. The synthesis of 3-MC consists of a few steps, visualized in figure 1; the first step is the key to success for the synthesis. 4-methylindanone (1) reacts in condensation with lithium salt of N,N-diethyl-1-naphthamide (2). At -60 ̊C the reaction of 1 and 2 afforded evenly to the lactone (3), the carbonyl addition product which underwent conversion on treatment with acid. The free acid (4) was obtained when the latter was cleaved reductively with zinc and alkali. Cyclization of the product occurred when treated with ZnCl2 in acetic acid anhydride and gave the compound 6-acetoxy-3-MC (5). Reducing this product with hydriodic acid in propionic acid resulted in 3-MC.

== Mechanism ==

3-MC has an inhibitory function in a dimethylnitrosamine demethylase process in rat livers. Inhibition could happen on by interfering in demethylase conformations or by interfering in synthesis and/or degradation of demethylase. Experiments showed that the Km doesn&#x27;t change after 3-MC treatment. This strongly indicates that enzyme affinity is not influenced by 3-MC. Instead, incubation with 3-MC leads to a decrease in the amount of enzyme activity. These results point towards inhibition of demethylase synthesis and/or induction of demetylase degradation. Unpublished observations of Venkatesan, Argus and Arcos suggest that demethylase synthesis inhibition is most plausible.

A possible mechanism for this reaction is depicted in figure (2). 3-MC is metabolized, via epoxidation, hydrolysis and another epoxidation, to a very reactive epoxide. Epoxidations are realized by the enzyme cytochrome P450. The second epoxide is not hydrolysed immediately because it is localized next to a bay region, which shields the epoxide. This way, the metabolite is able to travel and bind to DNA in figure (2). The mechanism is derived from the binding mechanism of benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene to DNA. This is likely because it is plausible that two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are metabolized via the same pathway. Deoxyguanosine is used in the figure, since that base appears to be bound to Benzo[a]pyrene far more often than the other bases.

There appears to be an equilibrium in 3-MC-free and 3-MC-bound. It is hard to determine how when the equilibrium is formed due to difficulties with radioactive measurements. A probable saturating dose is thought to be around 40 mg 3-MC/kg.

Research on the effect of 3-MC in rat uteri concludes that 3-MC acts as an estrogen antagonist. The sexhormone is, like 3-MC, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. 3-MC and estrogen bind to estrogenreceptors competitively, reducing the estrogen expression.

==Metabolism==
MC is metabolized by rat liver microsomes into oxygenated forms which alkylate DNA. These oxygenated metabolites bind to double-stranded and single-stranded. Empirical data show that MC tends to bind mostly to G-bases8.
When injected in lung, kidney or liver tissue of rats, it appears that the liver is able to reverse the MC-binding to DNA. Lung and kidney tissue are not capable of doing this, which may explain why MC is more carcinogenic in lungs and kidneys than in the liver. To be carcinogenic, the MC metabolite has to be covalently bound to DNA. Therefore, it is necessary for MC to be oxygenated in order to carcinogenic.
Injected MC does not move away from the injection site. In a rat body MC has a half-life of about 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, 80% of MC is metabolized into water-soluble metabolites. MC and its metabolites mainly exit the body via feces (a ninefold more urine). Three months after injection with MC, 85% of the rats are reported to have tumors. 82% of the tumors is a form of spindle-cell sarcoma.

==Efficacy==
Methylcholanthrene is often used to induce tumors in rodents for carcinogenesis and mutagenesis research. 
In a study from 1991, lung precancerous and cancerous lesions were induced in Wistar rats by one intrabronchial injection of 3-MC. After 30 days, atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium, adenoid hyperplasia or adenomas, and squamous cell carcinoma occurred in 15 (88.2%), 12 (70.6%) and 3 (17.7%) out of 17 rats respectively. After 60 days, the incidences were 15/18 (83.3%), 4/17 (23.5%) and 7/18 (38.9%). All of the precancerous lesions and carcinomas showed positive expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). 
Jin et al. (2013) found that the cellular redox balance is altered by acute exposure to 3-MC. This causes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated response pathway to induce antioxidant responses.

==Toxicity==
3-MC is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which stimulates transcription directed by xenobiotic response elements. AhR ligands can induce formation of an AhR-estrogen receptor (ER) complex. 3-MC was found to elicit estrogenic activity by this mechanism, and by stimulation of the expression of some endogenous ER target genes. 
3-MC may cause respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation or eye irritation.

==Effects on animals==

===Effects on human===

3-MC is mutagenic to human cells. Curren et al. (1978) were the first to report successfully induced mutations in human cells with 3-MC. Skin epithelial cells are thought to metabolize the compound to mutagenic products. 
The ability to metabolize mutagens may express genetically regulated differences within a species such as man or mouse, causing environmental chemicals to show a different level of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity to specific individuals.

===Non-human toxicity studies===
The administration of 3-MC to pregnant mice results in the formation of lung tumors in the offspring. Miller et al. (1990) compared the effects of fetal versus adult exposure to 3-MC on both induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity in lung and dependence of lung tumorigenesis on the Ah genotype. A single ip injection (in inducible fetal lung supernatants) of 100 mg/kg of 3-MC to the mothers resulted in a maximal 50-fold induction of AHH activity by 8 hr, which persisted for 48 hr. The same injections to adult F1 mice revealed only a 4- to 7—fold increase in lung AHH activity, compared to the large fetal induction ratio.
